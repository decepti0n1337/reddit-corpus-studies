since this is the top comment, they are updating the token/shop files to match classic wow https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/397545334554886144/573657527271686144/Picture2.png?width=1055&amp;height=334

---
This, I've been saying this for a while now.
---
they said Classic releasing this summer.
---
Undead mage
---
For pvp the shaman pvp spec (30/0/21) IS dps burst/off healing.
---

---
Edit: although that means you won‚Äôt really change specs between ele and resto, If you are looking for reasons to respec, priest speccing between shadow and holy will give you more versatility between 2 specs (although I‚Äôd say less versatile during a single spec, maybe) and uses similar gear and shadow is probably better for pve than ele.
---
&gt;we are getting **less** realms
---
we are getting **fewer** realms
---
In calls like this they don't give a rats ass about when or for how long the playerbase will be playing a title, they simple care about what quarter a title will be released in so they know what quarter the revenue will be attributed to. July 16th is a little over 2 weeks into summer, realistically it's way too early in their release window to be the release date.
---
But think of the male gnomes! They look so scary with new models..
---
It's actually a 4 month window because for some of the northern hemisphere summer starts on the 1st of June. 
---
Then if you include the southern hemisphere they could mean December so it's a split 5 month window.
---
They were Oceanic in name only until WoD. They were hosted with the US West servers but had the realm time set to Australian time.
---
mage by far
---
If there is a hunter in your raid group dedicated to weaving then yes, absolutely. They should get their bis weapon before offspecs.
---
And it isn't a meme. The fact you describe that play style as such puts you at the bottom of the barrel.
---
It goes to February 29 here.
---
You really poked the hive with thisüëÄ
---
Thing is we'll get OCE servers, its getting slotted into NA battlegroups for crbgs that will be the actual worst. 18ms for everything except instanced pvp heuehuehhuehuue
---
The population that can be on at one time was around there, but it‚Äôll likely be higher on classic
---
Exactly, we aren‚Äôt playing classic for the models, so why does it matter what I see in my screen vs what you see?
---
Warlock at pvp is one of the hardest classes to play.  
---
  Mage is the easiest class in every aspect.
---
Yeah, power infusion basically makes you a solid DPS for the duration.
---
Private Vanilla servers have far more than 200,000 active players. Nost almost had that by themselves. Classic's launch is going to be far more than 200,000 players.
---
?
---
We're all fucked
---
Edit:  Dead.  We're all dead.
---
Nice. I bet that got him a lot of views. He‚Äôs basically the CNN of Warcraft
---
SWALLOW SADNESS!
---
Yah brother, view this as a fresh start. Branch out!! Priests are kick ass healers and shadow is sick in PvP, but you have plenty of other healers with equally as fun attributes. Don‚Äôt forget, Classic will be around indefinitely (we think) so trial runs are always an option to find the class you come to love in the 1.12 state.
---
Orc makes sense but it's so ugly as a caster üòî and i have that Drakedog fantasy
---
Lets make a bunch a wild assumptions and declare Classic dead on arrival based on these assumptions
---
Back to p servers.
---
Winterspring might also be a shorter run.
---
Yeah he's not a good creator in any shape or form, hence the "for what is worth".   
---
  Nonetheless, something fun to wonder about.
---
The hate towards PVE servers I always find weird. Back in the day there was more PVE servers and players on them than PVP if memory serves.
---
This. I hope they are open to merging sooner rather than later.
---
This is a Horde and Alliance thing. You can AH jump in Orgrimmar and Ironforge.
---
Blizz has Australian servers for all of their games so I think it's safe to assume we will have at least 1 PvP server.
---
If you can‚Äôt want classic models then play classic. I want you to experience what I experience in bfa
---
It is. They're using the old maps entirely, they didn't just cherry pick them.
---
quick, this is going against our agenda here on /r/classicwow. this doesn't help blizzard. please downvote and move to the next thread.
---
Is sharding a wild accusation? How about debuff slots ?
---
Thats some freaky PC setup lol
---
 ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ BLIZZ TAKE MY ENERGY ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
oh no
---
So pretty much exactly the same thing...
---
People that did that had 2 seperate accounts back then though
---
Translation: "I only understand things that I agree with. Any opinions or preferences other than ones I share are wrong."
---
I'm playing a PvP server on release, but I don't give a shit if someone else prefers normal servers. Who cares?
---
Don‚Äôt know my faction yet but it would be:
---
Horde: orc male warlock and warrior, undead mage (sex is undecided)
---
Alliance: human female mage &amp; warlock, male warrior.
---
no. theres changefiles that show they've updated the token to display in the classic ui.  all other unneeded remnants have been removed without any changes being made prior.
---
why update it to work with classic if they dont intend to use it?
---
I don't get it. The whole point with [Carrot on a stick] is that it cannot be eaten
---
Because almost no one will be leveling prot. And when you‚Äôre 60, you can tank non-prot VERY easily.
---
Edit: you can tank dungeons as non-prot very easily (obviously not raids).
---
You‚Äôre not here to overreact? party pooper
---
EA forcing Bioware to focus on a Destiny competitor (they never do multiplayer...) over their Dragon Age series is so fucking stupid. Oh hey Dragon Age: Inquisition won GOTY in 2014 and there was a massive setup for the plot of the next game. Lets STOP MAKING IT! And force its studio to make something it has zero experience in! SMART! Fuck you EA.
---
As usual, another spec ed kid. See you in a few months.
---
Stop you're pissing of soupa! You don't want to see him angry
---
Except that they removed everything else and kept that in. Also updated it from the April 18th build on the 30th with different textures probably.
---
[deleted]
---
An interesting thought.
---
If this idea is the true difference between the two communities then why wouldn‚Äôt your ironic conclusion also apply to the classic community?
---
If it did, as I think it would, then why the air of superiority?
---
I've always wanted a foot pedal for push to talk for discord. But your idea is next level.
---
What do you guys think about this mixed pvp build?  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVbRZxGMscrktV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVbRZxGMscrktV)

/r/titlegore
---
I've vowed to give my dog a walk early each day before I start playing or after I've hit 2 hour play time for the day.   If you want to be productive use it as a stretch break in between long leveling periods.
---
July 16th my bois
---
Except they took every other you element from retail out and kept the token in. Also they updated the build on the 30th and changed the wow token with different textures I'm assuming.
---
Remnants. Token shop for some balance to buy game time I would assume is in game in some form since it wouldn't be too fair to be able to buy game time with gold from retail but not classic. Selling tokens for in-game gold shouldn't be in, however.
---
I've shipped games with all kinds of garbage that was deprecated but not removed on multiple platforms. You'll find PC code in some PS4 only games I've shipped. Xbox code in some PC only games I've shipped. On and on. I've helped a few devs port engines and you'll see shit that won't even work in engine A because it's from engine B - but it's there to reference during the port.
---
I'll wait until it's launched to start hoisting Blizz on a pike if there's anything that shouldn't be in there. Until then, steady as she goes.
---
I expect you to have a sub 100 hour Warrior run, then.
---
&gt; Is sharding a wild accusation
---
If you still don't understand how and why sharding is being implemented, then there's really no point in trying to explain it.
---
&gt; debuff slots
---
Game will be based on 1.12 client version, it's not ideal, but it's not the end of the world
---
‚ÄúWhat is love? Baby don‚Äôt hurt me...don‚Äôt hurt me...no more..‚Äù
---
interesting but there are other variables that can increase time to kill such as dodge, miss parry, resist. nice theory craft though
---
who?
---
Ah yes I remember the WoW clone cycle....Vanguard-&gt;Age of Conan-&gt;Warhammer Online-&gt;SWTOR-&gt;Rift-&gt;Wildstar Online
---
Probably missed a couple but yeah...only SWTOR ever took off although Wildstar had some serious potential.
---
How do those relate in any way?  This is data-mining based on code taken from recent builds of retail, there‚Äôs plenty of explanations.
---
Even if this meant what people are assuming...how is this so much worse than all the behind the scenes private server bs? Would at least wait to hear for confirmation from Blizzard and rationale...
---
How do you listen in to these conferences? I am really interested
---
Ye, it sure was. Although if you are in a hc raiding guild that cares a bit about min/maxing you'll have to drop the reckoning talents for the crit chance in the holy tree. 
---
But if I would play pala, I'd play like this. A ton of survivability for pvp with more than decent heals.
---
See ya a minute after June!
---
What? Wow, I didn't know that. Where in Booty Bay is it?! I only remember the one in Gadgetzan.
---
&gt;ming is also retardedly easy as you are by far the best gold grinder. PvP is easy, but can also be quite hard. Mages have a fairly high skill ceiling, not even close to warlock/druid/shaman though.
---
Shamans high skill ceiling in PvP? Lol...
---
I'm just sitting here frying my brain playing the godawful MTG Arena. Its so bad but MTG itself is so good I'm torturing myself with it.
---
Yeah, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need something more official before I get my pitchfork out
---
I have some anecdotal experience.  I have a friend who feared the idea of playing on a PvP realm, but I pushed him to play on one, and he loved it.  He expressed that he would've missed out otherwise.  
---
I wonder whether or not many PvE players have had a taste of WoW without the PvP feature stripped off.
---
Either way, I don't understand the preference.
---
Thanks Stannis.
---
No, I agree that they dont give a shit about the community when discussing this type of thing but it is in the back of their minds when they are releasing it so they know how to represent the data.
---
Paying for gold was also in vanilla. You risked being banned but it was there. I prefer this to getting gold sellers sending me private messages constantly
---
it was just a blizzard intern that updated the wow token file. the classic team would never do that. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Totally agree.  Having bots/chinese gold farmers everywhere is so much better /s
---
&gt; You risked being banned
---
I'd say that's a big difference.
---
Blizzard sanctioned gold selling contradicts what Classic is supposed to be about.
---
Yup, that's why there's always tons of pages of Green Hills of Stranglethorn on the neutral AH. It's the easiest way to buy or sell the pages if you're on the quest.
---
Not if you are sick!
---
Classic and Retail are going to share a subscription. I wonder if this is just compatibility or something for retail tokens.
---
I hope they aren't going to appear in Classic. That would be a pretty huge impact to the in-game economy.
---
How does this not exist?
---
The Matrix.
---
Realistically its like a 6 month window after july
---
This is interesting data, but it's borderline nonsense without a lot of supporting context &amp; additional data.
---
All of your jargon "TTL, XPH, Ret, Ret R1, Spelladin, Ret Spelladin, Deep Ret Spellgear, Deep Ret Spellgear R1" is poorly defined. Why use acronyms when you spend paragraphs talking about the nitty gritty technical details of your calculations?  
---
One could make assumptions by what you mean by these things, but "Deep Ret Spellgear" for example seems pretty suspect when you're simulating DPS at level 10 because you cannot possibly be deep ret nor have spellgear at level 10.
---
Can't just throw data at people, gotta be able to tell a story with it, which means it needs to be in an understandable form.
---
My balls have more information than most blue posts.
---
&gt; why update it to work with classic if they dont intend to use it?
---
Now that is just me talking out of my ass but here it goes:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
One possible explanation would be that ‚Äì as they said during Blizzcon ‚Äì they intend to develop their tools for Classic in ways that they benefit both versions of the game.     
---
It stands to reason that Classic will always be retail ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù ‚Äì which could be why the Demo client from Blizzcon was based on 7.3.5 and the current alpha/beta client is based on 8.0. 
---
If they change stuff for the tokens and store for one version, the update would also apply to both versions of the game since Blizzard intends to use the same framework for both.
---
I might be WAY off mark with this speculation, but as long as we don‚Äôt hear anything official it‚Äôs all just speculation anyways.
---
Certain people were losing their shit when ‚Äú/lfr‚Äù opened a menu on the demo client and yet it was later confirmed that that was still being removed.
---
Seeing how the ‚Äúbeta‚Äù client is still just an internal build as of now I‚Äôd take any kind of data from there with a massive grain of salt.
---
It's not about being an 'Alexensual boy' or 'hurting blizzard', it's about making sure we as a community communicate to blizzard our voices &amp; feelings on features that will be harmful to the game.
---
There‚Äôs only room for one shadow priest though after ZG. But most raids really do want that one shadow priest. They are great for PvP as well.
---
MMOs are dead. Why would a big publisher put millions into a MMO if you can just make a shooter and sell lootboxes to 14year olds. they dont wanna cater to the hardcore gamers anymore they are shit customers. We spend years playing the same game and bitch about change. We dont buy enough. They want a young teen buying all the new triple A games for 60‚Ç¨ each and all the loot boxes for skins until their favorite streamer tells them to play something else. Its way more profitable.
---
Why dismiss July? That‚Äôs being pessimistic so yeah if you want to be rational it‚Äôs hard to dismiss July as it is still a possibility
---
Shhhh we can't talk here... They haveüëÄ
---
Google "Blizzard investor relations" and that first link will get you to the conference call.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre being verbose.
---
I don‚Äôt think I am at all. 
---
&gt;Many aspects of the game that make a great player are independent of class.
---
This is exactly the reason I disagree with you.
---
I would be upset if I poured hours upon hours into the game, got to level 40, finally felt like I had a good grasp on game mechanics and PvE/PvP, but realized I was playing a class I don‚Äôt like because someone on the internet told me to pick a random class.
---
My advice is figure out which class appeals to you and go from there. Like you said, playing any class will teach you the fundamentals of the game, so you might as well take the time to pick a class you think you‚Äôll like so you don‚Äôt waste your time.
---
I agree with those 2 builds being very good, but you definitely don't NEED charge for PvP. Only for Battlegrounds. A druid playing 30/0/21 is made around fighting from max range (so is similar specs like 27/0/24 or 21/0/30 etc) If you play any type of balance build you never want to be inside 30 yard range. Only against hunters.
---
Considering Blizz is US based, the Summer window is June 21st to September 22nd.  
---
I expect release will be fairly early in the season, because there have been several comments from Blizz that mention having a "Classic Summer" and I feel like that implies we'll be spending Summer playing Classic.
---
I get it, but not everyone enjoys the same thing. When I played classic, I started on a medium pop pve server with the rest of my friends. I was a noob who didn't want to keep getting ganked while learning the game. Coming from WC3 I really wanted to enjoy the lore and world before I even thought about being competitive. I also just didn't really care about PVP at that time. Once I played the game more I decided to make a new character on a higher pop PVP server. 
---
Now I exclusively play on PVP but I 100% understand why other people wouldn't want to. Some people like to just enjoy the game without interacting much with other players in combat.
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
I had it on my Hunter, all of our Warriors were Fury so it was a toy to anyone in the raid. I had tons of DKP saved up and got it, only one other guy wanted it and I had more.
---
But muh THAC0!
---
True, but my math is based on even level mob kills, and the math for 1H and 2H should remain the same for a paladin, so miss, dodge, parry, etc should be even throughout the tests. Especially with maces / swords on a human, where it should be fairly negligible.
---
And the idea behind this isn't to find time to kill, it's more of using a baseline that should apply to all specs, and seeing how factors A, B, C, talents 1, 2, 3, gearing Q, R, S changes between one and the other.
---
It looks like ret pally, wearing a few easy to get spell power items (red mageweave, etc) after level 40 might be the way to go.
---
And by using Rank 1 SoC, mana's a total nonissue, and even with lower DPS, the kills per minute  /XPM increase cause no downtime.
---
July 16
---
Some time back a forum CM or dev (don't remember who) mentioned that the bright night thing was a bug that was somehow related to CRZ. As of WoD when I quit they not only had not fixed it, but had spun it as a "feature", citing people who could only play at night grew tired of the constant night time gloom or something to that effect if memory serves (and it might not lol). As somebody who worked nights for years I personally did not feel that way, and never heard people complain about it, but what do I know?
---
Anyway, somebody on this sub told me that it has been fixed as of either Legion or BFA. I can't confirm, just something I've been told, I haven't played since WoD.
---
plus that [theory](https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/) about the names "osconty" and "July" at blizzcon
---
I think it was just important to make my stance known since i was mentioned in the video that i didn't make people aware of the change to purposely bash blizzard, but as us as a community to discuss it and make our voices &amp; feelings known to them to reiterate that we don't want these sort of features in the game.

BWL gets slightly better with having more mechanics, and AQ has some wonky stuff.

To troll you, specifically.

---
For raiding PVE there isn't really a healer class that does well as DPS. Feral druid is the closest to being viable. In dungeons everything is fine.
---
As for PVP there's a lot of cool stuff you can do.
---
Ret or reckoning paladin can do quite well at destroying people in world 1v1 pvp. 
---
Enhancement shaman is a bit of the same as ret/reckoning paladin except with RNG involved and less survival, but potentially more burst.
---
Elemental shaman is a really cool hybrid spec that can blow up players, heal your buddies and do some really cool stuff. This is the prefered shaman spec for ANY kind of pvp. 
---
Priest also have some nice hybrid specs, and then ofc shadowpriest which can destroy players in wpvp.
---
Druid is kinda weird, there's a tri-spec that does well in wpvp in a way of slowly dotting down the target while staying alive. Other specs are kinda meh in pvp, and ofc deep resto can be really fun in wsg with flagcarrying.

It's an interesting thought I won't lie.  And yes, the VW usually mindlessly chases feared mobs and does it inefficiently getting off no hits or taunts.  
---
I guess I am just wondering about cost efficiency too now--as you'll be leveling up your Imp's talents as well as VW in case you need to switch to it--maybe skipping Consume Shadows though easily.
---
You do this from 10-60?
---
low iq question the difference is obvious
---
This is the same for the store interface files as well, but not as unexpected since this was always on the table in the future for realm transfers etc.
---
Maybe a little, personally i just want Blizzard official servers with proper quality and no sketchy admins.  Id prefer no tokens but this is hardly a hill to die on imo.  Think people are getting a little entitled with classic.
---
Concurrent players, not total population .
---
Agreed. But the post isn't about Spelladin, Ret R1, Deep Ret Spellgear R1 specifics, but how reducing 1 element, time between pulls, affects all equally.
---
But I'll elucidate.
---
- Ret is normal ret leveling guide. Pretty much what you;'ll find when googling "vanilla paladin leveling guide"
---
- Ret R1 is the above, but only using Rank 1 Seal of Command
---
- Spelladin is holy down to imp Seal of Justice and Consecrate, then Ret as normal, but using spell gear and fast 1H weapons to proc the best seal.
---
- Deep Ret Spellgear is Ret above, but tossing in the 'Spelladin' + spell damage gear sacrificing + str gear
---
- Deep Ret Spellgear R1 is Ret above, but tossing in the 'Spelladin' + spell damage gear sacrificing + str gear and only using Rank 1 Seal of Command.
---
XPH is fairly understood as XP per Hour. And TTL was mentioned in the prior paragraph as Time To Level.
---
The specifics of each spec / build aren't really important here tho. Those, whatever they might be called, are just there to show that changing 1 element affects all of them one way or the other.
---
&gt;seems pretty suspect when you're simulating DPS at level 10
---
And you'll notice that all the Ret specs are identical at level 10, because one build doesn't differ from the others that early.
---
Pitchforks for sale!
---
I'm eagerly awaiting tokens in Classic and the accompanying revival of "y'all dint listen!"
---
Dont feed
---
People who seriously think they would allow people to sell Tokens for Gold in Classic are retarded.
---
Bruh. Idk about you but my pc could barely handle wow. I had an old pc next to it tho to thotbot stuff. Makes sense to me
---
In other words you don't have a valid reason, and you just wanted to start a downvote train.  Got it.
---
Entitled to what, exactly? Something that was promised to us?
---
Its not rocket-science. If a Warrior is on you, you are dead. If a Rogue is on you, you are dead. ...unless you are a Pally.
---
um, thats giving it more credit. unless you have anything different youd like to share?
---
\*golf clap\*
---
Considering it will be free to play for the still millions of retail subscribers it won't be that big of a cash flow. Obviously a lot of people like myself will resub, probably hundred of thousands, but that's still pennies compared to the immediately cash flow of a new game title. This is good, if they aren't looking to make that much off classic, then they won't sell out that much on it either :D
---
Does that not come off as incredibly entitled?  You think Blizzard is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts?
---
I'm not sure how far you got in TBC, but Vanilla raiding wasn't even close to Sunwell.  There were less cats to herd in TBC, but the mechanics were much more complex. Things are fairly mindless until AQ40.
---
There is an inherit risk in buying gold from a 3rd party. You do something that was not intended and you get banned for it.
---
Blizzard directly allowing gold to be traded for real money is the antithesis of what they said they were looking to deliver to the playerbase.
---
Heal first and ask for forgiveness later.
---
BC is drastically harder than Vanilla. 1 trash mob in retail has more mechanics than all of the bosses in MC combined.
---
The hardest part of vanilla wow is getting 40 warm bodies into a raid at the same time.
---
I am super jazzed about the 50 characters being *separate* from retail characters.  I was so worried I was going to have to go on a character deleting rampage for Classic!
---
You also used to share exp while in a group. Get ready for some grind sessions due to quests not bumping you up enough in exp.
---
It's very much based on subjective things, such as the people you are rating with and your own skill and your gear.
---
A level ~ 50 quest paying less than one stack of arrows.
---
[removed]
---
They are looking to deliver the ability to get banned?  It sounds like you don't really know what you're talking about.
---
Doesn't happen much on pservers.
---
Though onyxia pug runs with the organiser putting loot on bid is pretty common on pservers.
---
Can't say for retail vanilla.
---
I mean, have you been watching the progress on Mythic Crucible of the Storms? It‚Äôs been over a week and the top raiding guilds still haven‚Äôt downed the last boss. 
---
Raiding in retail is going to have a lot more mechanics and more communication than Vanilla. In Vanilla, it was more about having the right gear, classes, etc. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to be super easy, but compared to Mythic Raiding, it‚Äôs easier.
---
It would be an understatement to say that this news was underwhelming.
---
&gt;Yes you need to respec as mage. Their pve spec is atrocious in pvp. 
---
This isn't true, [this rather recent article from Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-mage-pve-dps) does a pretty good job of explaining the different specs available to PvP. It's true when you're talking about the "Arcane Power" spec (mostly arcane w/ 20 pts in frost) but definitely not the "Winter's Chill" spec!
---
It is well known that the "Winter's Chill spec" (AKA Deep Frost) in particular can do just fine in both PvP and PvE, where it provides solid DPS (not the best) while providing mandatory PvE utility for the raid AND also having many of the nice frost utility talents that PvP frost mages need, including Ice Barrier, Ice Block and Shatter. 
---
Depending on your guild/raid's requirements and experience, you can even make your own "Winter's Chill" variant that forgoes some of the threat reduction &amp; mana efficiency talents like "Arcane Meditation", "Frost Channeling" &amp; others that would allow you to dip into the lovely PvP / soloing / dungeon-only talents like "Permafrost" or "Frostbite" :)
---
You'll most likely be able to use a retail token from the classic client to reactivate. Not a big deal.  
---
    
---
We won't see them in classic, it would be running the project into the ground and they know it, so calm your tits, the sky isn't falling lol.

There were less boss mechanics than retail. It was actually still difficult enough back then, but people have more knowledge now. Besides that, early raids are going to be nerfed compared to their vanilla versions. Naxx will effectively be the same, but MC was harder when the game was released than once 1.12 was out, because of differences in talents, itemization, and boss nerfs. Unfortunately it appears we will have ‚Äúeasy‚Äù MC even when it‚Äôs the only raid (besides onyxia). This obviously makes less sense than allowing MC to be dumbed down by that point in Vanilla, when there were multiple harder raids out and BC was coming out in several months anyway so they wanted people to be able to experience more of the content.

Rub more salt in the wound. Call him a carebear and tell him the PvE servers are that way -----&gt;
---
Haha yeah I think that lasted for like a week or something. Server forums were lit up lol
---
Considering that they're releasing the game globally and not just in the US it's kind of silly for them to use local terms and not global ones.
---
I pay $90/m for 850/850, it‚Äôs unbelievable what I‚Äôm reading in here.
---
Perfect yeti hide was repeatable.  It was just a drop from yeti.
---
My only concern is PVP server in my time zone, away from any streamers/reddit/"unofficial oceanic" servers.

---
The reason spriests were brought after zg on private servers was because thats when 16 debuff slots got added. There will be 16 debuff slots on classic at launch and hardcore raids likely still arent going to bring a shadowpriest because warlocks barely do very little dps early anyway and shadow weaving can be brought by a healing priest anyway that specs for it.
---
I don't think that's called being entitled. I'm fairly certain it's called expecting something that we were explicitly told we were going to receive and give them money for.
---
And no, of course Blizzard isn't doing it out of the goodness of their heart. They're doing it for money. 
---
And they can expect less of it if they don't deliver what they said they were going to.
---
Half way across the map though. Just felt it was funny when other quests around that level gives 1 gold.
---
Well if you look at the loot trading post, a few weeks after it was posted they updated it to say that customer service will not move items around even after the 2hr time window is up if you missed the time window to trade the loot to another player. Maybe they're so stretched on customer support they're having internal discussions on considering wow tokens to lower the impact on customer supports in dealing with gold sellers. It's not out of the realms of possibility but yes it's still unlikely at this stage but we need to make it known to them that will be bad for the game to make sure they don't.
---
PC gaming or gaming in general still has it's moments with the occasional release of something extraordinary. For me, that right now much like Classic WoW is a much much older game. City of heroes.
---
AQ/Naxx are similar to SSC/Mag level I'd say. The later raids - Tempest/Hyjal/BT/Sunwell are clearly another step up in execution requirements.
---
Any guild that managed to kill Muru or KT before the big nerfs would have absolutely no problem with any Vanilla raids.
---
While you're here, take a look at this priest tri-spec  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVgh00bZf0tZVMGd0tk](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVgh00bZf0tZVMGd0tk) 
---
I would level disc first, then shadow, then holy for nova farming. I could use this spec for everything from leveling to healing 5 mans, even world pvp should be fun.
---
The sociopath is the correct path.
---
This. I'd reroll on Ner'zhul
---
world Ohio  
---
You wrote that from your phone with janky autocorrect yes? :p
---
No significance in the lore? I'm shocked a druid would say that. Hamuul basically co-founded the Cenarion Circle and he's the head Druid in all of Thunder Bluff. Even his children play extremely important story roles in WC quests.
---
The worst part about it was that it was unique, so while you were out there grinding yeti for leather they'd keep dropping and you'd have to throw it out so you could pick it up again.
---
It‚Äôs very possible they could have several server types. Private servers kinda have this. Like Blizzlike with no xp multiplier and some with 15% multiplier. 
---
As long as they have Blizzlike servers with no WoW Store, I don‚Äôt think it will hurt the people who want that true Vanilla experience.
---
Feral isn't really a dps offspec unfortunately. Cat pvp is super meme tier, can't really compare it to spriest pvp.
---
It won't be easy. People are basing this off of private servers which don't come close to being realistic. 
---
You needed fire resist gear in Vanilla to down trash mobs and on private servers people are killing bosses without any resist gear. People were new to MMO's back in 2004 but they weren't retarded. The values are not the same. 
---
Also the mechanics in vanilla are less "Don't stand in this obvious big red spot!" and instead rely on 40 people being able to communicate, CC, watch their aggro, some fights have like 6 tanks that need to coordinate, etc.
---
I dont mind wow token in classic, would be nice. I dont believe it will effect gameplay as much as people think it will
---
That's a pretty great idea
---
Oceanic tagged servers* launched a year later. Took like 8 years to get actual oceanic servers.  
---
  
---
edit: I see someone's commented the exact same thing further down lol.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how blizzard sees it, it would be two of their products going head to head with each other which I doubt they‚Äôd want. They need all the attention on BFA because it‚Äôs a big patch that will supposedly ‚Äúfix‚Äù a lot of problems
---
Don't put words in my mouth.
---
If Blizzard actually meant what they [said at Blizzcon](https://youtu.be/dUSRkBwQdc8?t=287), then buying gold through them isn't what I would consider an "authentic" experience.
---
Good thing you covered up those identities. Or else I would have had to remove it for personal information.
---
Sharding in Durotar whatever, loot trade in raids whatever, WoW token? Fuck that shit.
---
Why 3 points in Feral Instinct over Feral Aggression?
---
do you mean possibility instead of ability? low iq confirmed
---
I'm waiting to find out where my friends are going to play. If Alliance, human paladin. If horde, tauren shaman.
---
Can never be too careful out there. Alliance spies are everywhere.
---
If there was one every healer would be playing it.
---
Raiding was definitely hard in vanilla...but nobody knew what they were doing.  No YouTube, only printed guides and information moved much slower then.  You'd have a quarter of the raid afk standing in fire, 1/4 still in green quest gear, 1/4 standing in fire just because they couldn't be bothered to move, and maybe the quarter left who knew what they were doing.  Mechanics were much simpler then...basically don't stand in the freaking fire.  Hard part was keeping the raid group together during 800 trash pulls between bosses.  I've had many many good vanilla raids, but they weren't hard because of mechanics.  TBC raids were miles above and beyond vanilla in difficulty, and some of the best raids they've ever done (imo).
---
Look i wasn‚Äôt even singling you out to begin with.  IMO people should expect classic, the exact parameters of that are up to Blizzard.  Personally i‚Äôm willing to accept some blemishes like this to make that happen and i‚Äôm willing to bet many others are but instead overreact and enter the stages of grief before they come around to accept it.  All for complaining to Blizzard about things but i wouldn‚Äôt put your trust in them to have the same goals in mind for the game
---
How is sharding being implemented and to what extent? Thanks in advance for explaining.
---
Look guys, I get that we are excited for classic and many of us--myself included--are sick of retail wow, but let's not delude ourselves in a circlejerk here. Retail wow will most likely still have quite an active playerbase. It really feels like wow has reached a point where more new players are subbed to wow than players who have been subbed since early on.
---
Classic wow will mostly appeal to people who are accustomed to the old game and feel the game holds a nostalgic factor for them. The new generation of gamers will probably have a hard time getting into the "clunky" and "inconvenient" playstyle of classic wow.
---
I have a friend who started playing in late wrath and is still subbed to this day. He is one of the last people in our friend group who still plays retail. A few months ago, my friend group decided to play a classic private server because most of us are stoked for classic release. Well, that one friend did almost nothing but complain about certain game mechanics. There were some RPG elements he enjoyed, but overall he just got so used to the quality of life improvements in retail wow.
---
He's a pretty hardcore gamer, so I imagine many new casual players will have an even stronger reaction than his.
---
Either way who cares? I just wanna play classic again with people who enjoy it as much as me. Let retail live on. If other people would rather play that, then please do.
---
That is the point (s)he is trying to make. Warlocks are bad at AOE farming because all options have downsides.
---
Yeah they bought King (the company that made candy crush) for 5.9bn dollars.
---
So they‚Äôre probably pretty eager to see that thing turn a profit.
---
Seems like a big yikes to me but I know nothing.
---
LOL that's silly burnout
---
Didn't they take the toggle out of retail cause it was buggy?
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt know why they are sleeping on these products being remastered and released.
---
I don't care if they are in or not.  There is no real purist moral high ground here though.  They want the farmers in the game so that the farmers grind all the crap they don't want to spend time doing.  Then they can hoover up the stuff for cheap from the farmers trying to make their gph quota, while they hide behind their pretend \#nochanges holier than thou mask.
---
I love the new textures and animations. (I am clearly in the minority here) But if they made the old textures and animations just reworked to look higher quality, I would not mind that at all. I know there is the whole puritan "I dont wanr anything changed option going around.) But wouldn't some graphical changes to make it look less muddy and more modern?
---
Saying the same thing over and over again (that they're targeting a summer release) doesn't lend more credit.
---
Laughed way harder than I should have lol
---
I don‚Äôt know anyone that plays those games and yet they basically print money.  Baffling to me too
---
Are you kidding 2 Mb/s was huge in Aus. I didn't get that speed until 3 years ago.

The only consolation is that I finish my master's degree on the first of July. No distractions until then!

Yeah holy fuck this guy should spend a few minutes before making a video to plan out what he wants to say.

Facts. Golden age of gaming was like 05-11. Industry had reached critical mass and was booming, however it was new enough where the corporate side of it hadn't quite discovered its financial roadmap. 
---
Now most of the industry has regressed to a conveyor belt of bare minimum effort heavily monetized games. 
---
The "moms credit card" trope has never been more true, and were all fucked.
---
I think it can be summed up like this: easier from a skill perspective, but harder from a management perspective. You can by a progression raider on retail by only logging in for raid nights. You won't have the gold to do that in classic, and for certain classes you'll need to prepare for raids by farming mats. There's also the matter of getting 40 people online at once.
---
I feel like this is an Apple to an orange question. 
---
Vanilla was about having 40 competent people.  Easy right?  Obviously not otherwise many many more guilds would have cleared naxx. 
---
Retail is about having a smaller group of more competent people.  Easy right?  Obviously not or more people clear content. 
---
Neither is harder or easier. Just different.
---
I'm actually curious what could distract you from Classic WoW's hype if they're releasing in mid-to-late summer versus the first day of summer like a lot of optimistic people want.

You‚Äôre either trolling or have very limited knowledge on vanilla WoW
---
It‚Äôs only BiS for mages if you‚Äôre also a tailor, because the set bonus is only for tailors, and also because crit is huge for fire spec.
---
For warlocks, it‚Äôs bis regardless of tailoring.
---
Raiding has gotten harder and harder as the xpacs have gone, retail is 1000% harder to raid in than vanilla
---
I still take the VW talents eventually. Low tier demo talents are pretty much garbage so might as well go for something situationally useful.
---
And number one rule is don't limit yourself by following a strict set rules. I generally level with the imp, but if I am grinding in a certain area or trying to do a certain quest where it just isn't working I will absolutely swap out for another demon.
---
I do, for the most part, level to 60 with the imp. But it's important to be flexible and recognize the best tool at the time.
---
Good for that guy. People like him are awsome!
---
Yeah that's one thing I can't put up with on retail. It was actually easier before because we played the whole game with lag and learnt how to deal with it. Going from instant casts to a delay in PvP is a headache.
---
If you actually think this is "proof" that they are going to add wow tokens into classic is just being stupid. It's obviously just for people to access the UI when their sub is expired. When you log into BFA and don't have a sub, then try to log into a character, it tells you that you need can use your gold to buy a token right there in the character select screen. It's likely just that being put into the same system for classic. It won't be so you can sell wow tokens on classic, that won't happen. Wow tokens will only be sold on retail and your gold will be taken from retail too.
---
How is it harder than mage? Don‚Äôt mages have far more abilities and cooldowns to manage?
---
They've said it will only affect starting zones. So Durotar, Elwyynn, Mulgore, etc. I really don't see them shading something as big as barrens. 
---
If you've ever played during launch week of any popular online game, you've probably experienced being stuck in queues, server crashes, massive lag, etc.
---
While it does feel dirty to have sharding in classic, it would help to alleviate a lot of those issues.
---
That is definitely an argument to be made, especially because those last 5-10 people in the raids back then definitely were worse that the rest.  You might be right, I am looking forward to finding out.
---
Oceanic rise up!
---
They talked about having servers in every region (like retail) so we expect servers located in oceanic.
---
Trying to decide if you are high or just this irritating because you can. Everything you have said here is pointless and serves no reason but to pick a fight
---
Lol. Not even close.
---
Lock is more complicated and more rewarding.
---
Group only, so it's hardly worth remembering
---
Nah, in wrath threat was absolutely trivialized.. The issues inn vanilla is that tanks have pretty much no aoe threat. So if you, even by accident, attack a different target than the one the tank is currently hitting you will aggro.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to allow WoW tokens in claaaic quit your whining people.
---
Alliance also has the fountain near the bank in Stormwind.
---
Beach, Lake, Hiking, River Rafting. You know, summer stuff. Water is still cold during first part of summer so I don't do those kinds of things until mid to late summer. Once I start playing WoW it is easy to get attached and avoid other activities, but once I start indulging in summer my brain isn't content with sitting in front of a computer for hours at a time when it knows I could be outside instead. So if it is not out before mid summer it is likely I won't pick it up until Fall. By then who knows what else will be out that might be more appealing.
---
Great approach. Well done blizzard. No new models for anyone. I want to be playing the same game as everyone else, don‚Äôt want half the people to be playing Disney classic, I want them to be seeing the same game as I am, otherwise just breaks social immersion.

---
I asked why it mattered, and the only reason given was "because it wouldn't be authentic if you didn't have to go to a gold farmer to buy your gold!"
---
That's a stupid reason.  Why does it matter who you buy your gold from?  It doesn't.  Either way you get your gold.
---
Therefore, the only other thing a gold farmer provides is a bunch of things in the economy that wouldn't otherwise be there.  If there were no gold farmers, there would be a whole lot less things on the auction house.  That means you would have to go get them yourselves.
---
But people don't come out and say that is the reason they don't want it.  They pretend it's to make it "authentic".  That they are disgusted at the idea of a token because it makes it less real.  
---
The token itself doesn't matter.  Buying gold from Blizzard doesn't matter.  The difference actually is the amount of junk on the auction house and in trade from people trying to get you to buy crap so they can hit their gold per hour quota.
---
But please pretend it's because you want to sit on your \#nochanges high horse.
---
thankfully you can be banned for that. Go play retail.
---
I'm not planning on playing a pally or leveling by grinding, but man do I find the level of work you put into these facinating.  Keep up the good work you magnificent bastard!

---
not about nostalgia. it‚Äôs about the social immersion that comes with everyone looking at the same version of characters. not having that goes against the spirit of vanilla and matters way more than people think.
---
I'm not sure what you need from blacksmithing that you can't get from someone else. 
---
Humans get the weapon skill with mace and swords which is good for dps, but not that relevant for paladins, especially in PvP. Dwarves get stoneform which is quite useful for the armour bonus and saving a cleanse spell. Humans also get 10% rep which is always nice in vanilla, but of course has no long-term use.

I'll be MT for my guild. So Warrior.

But I can't decide race! Troll for that TPS? Orc for the looks and lore? Tauren for the beef, warstomp and health? &gt;.&lt;

https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/BZww3xZwBP_ITBAA
---
That's what I level as. Usually imp talents first, then all the affliction talents, and then finish up with the rest of the demo talents.
---
Improved imp increases fire bolt damage by 30%, which  increases low level warlock overall dps far more than any other option.
---
It‚Äôs 100% feral.
---
Feral is a top top tier dps spec if you‚Äôre doing it right and you get an allocated debuff slot for rip.
---
Only a few specs are not viable. Most are
---
I think it's inevitable within the first 3-4 months, at least on a small scale. There are going to be a few random servers that drop to ~1k population after the tourists leave, and their options are going to be offering free tansfers from high-pop servers or to merge servers.

Hahaha!!

and they will be rightfully banned if found out. it‚Äôs against the tos.
---
Thanks for this!
---
No, implementing the WoW token into Classic would be basically capitulating to the fact that a game goes pay to win. There's no reason to accept economical strength outside of the game as valid ingame economic strength. Making Blizzard the intermediary legitimizes this. That's why they were banning people/gold-farmers back in the day, because it's not playing fair. It's abusing your economical standpoint in real life to advance yourself in a world where everyone should start equal.
---
If you don't see the difference between a company punishing gaining unfair advantages through means acquired outside of the game itself, i.e cheating, and tacitly approving that behavior by profiting from it, you're a lost cause.
---
point is moot anyway, classic won't get a token, at least in its first iteration.
---
Bruh yall need to chill with the downvotes holy moly
---
Their raid spec isn't the best for PvP. And their fire raid spec is really bad for anything but raiding. I don't think you need to be frost specced to grind DM, maybe you need for the crocs in ZG. 
---
Otherwise you could probably get away with PvPing as frost raid spec, it's just not very optimal.
---
I played from vanilla beta through the first tier of cataclysm entirely on PvP servers, but I think in classic me and my friends all plan on playing on a PvE server this time around. Since we're all old with limited time and don't really care about world PvP, all it would serve to do is get in the way and arbitrarily slow one or more of us down.
---
It‚Äôs funny how one person can trigger so many people lmao
---
Right, I suppose I should have specified: they don't have any real significance in the lore prior to WoW, at least as far as the games go. Hamuul's a big deal to the tauren in-game, to be sure, but, as I'm aware, he didn't exist until WoW did.
---
Seriously.  Dude's acting like he's a fucking cancer patient and classic WoW is his last chance at chemo.
---
Also, it might be necessary in some regions with different rules or restrictions.  Thinking like South Korea or China.

Keeping tokens out of the game doesn't solve the pay to win problem.  People will buy gold either way.
---
Blizzard is trying to retain subs by having Retail players play Classic when bored.
---
You want to drop Classic on the retail players right when they are considering unsubbing, which will be like a month after 8.2.
---
So they go Retail-Classic-New patch comes out back to Retail.
---
Yeah, part of it was that a number of the quests required a group. But more importantly, that group had to be formed by people talking to people and inviting people, not with some automatic group finder tool.
---
Other than that, it also felt more difficult back then because we had less experience with MMO's back then.
---
Reduces chance enemy‚Äôs detect you while prowling. Maybe you‚Äôre right.

Meaning the interface won't be loaded, but doesn't dismiss the possibly that they're maybe considering it for the future otherwise they would've gotten rid of the files completely instead of updating the interface version and disabling the interface from being loaded at this current time.

There were still some tanks that struggled with AoE threat in Wrath.  Maybe not as bad, but it was still an issue, especially with massive AoE DPS specs there (bladestorm warriors, etc).
---
Single target was still absolutely an issue, though.
---
mechanically it's a fair bit easier.
---
More preparation before the raid though.
---
10 characters per server is more than during Vanilla.
---
Where is the outrage from the nochanges group?
---
Orc Hunter ! I want that juicy stun resist for even easier kiting and the pet damage is neat too. Also I like to see boots on my characters and the crossbow animations on male orc are so sick.

Do whatever you want to do and then accept whatever response you get in return.
---
If you set your hearth to ratchet you could ride back quickly too!
---
I don't mean to argue with this because I agree with it 100%, but what SM/Ruin has over these specs is versatility. Its often useful to highlight a point with a metaphor so here we go: CS GO, awp is better to hold of in long range, or even in short range holding a corner, but not agaisnt multiple targets striking you. Playing close range only there are many options in the game and often cheap guns like pistols are enough, but if you need to challenge someone at longer range you are straight at disadvantage. The assault rifles on the other hand can handle both situations fairly well. Its not as likely to kill opponent with first hit as awp would, nor is it as cheap as a pistol so you cant have it always, but when something unexpected happens and you have to react, its good for every situation. Thats what SM/Ruin offers aswell. Your curses have a little more hit and range from talents which is nice for both pve and pvp as you can imagine, you have the burst potential from destruction talents and so on. While it wont be the best for everything, you know when you get that m4/ak at the start of the round that you can manage pretty much anything. Of course this doesn't mean that you cant or shouldn't be respeccing from time to time, but it means that if you wanna do some pvp weekend stuff and raiding during the week, you dont need to respec twice that week, which imo is really nice. On the other hand if you are going to be ranking up for next 3 months or you play on pve server and all you do is raiding, then there is really no much need for it.
---
Best in Slot
---
epicly delusional this one here.
---
Not really. December while technically summer in some places is not what Blizzard means by even a late summer release. They are 100% talking about the North American summer.
---
For 5-min sustain? \~900dps, which is pretty low.
---
I disagree with this because it creates a different visual experience for everyone. I want everyone to see my character the same way I see my character - if they are using new models they will see my character totally differently from how I view it. There needs to be a consistent visual experience. Many of the new models/faces look drastically different from the originals. 
---
In addition, they ended up removing the toggle from modern WoW. Who's to say they wouldn't end up removing it from classic eventually as well, if not many people were using it? 
---
Those are my legitimate problems with having a toggle, otherwise I wouldn't care.
---
Retail is shit, been playing vanilla pservers since 2014 and haven't touched retail since early cata. I just like good graphics. Thankfully a ban for this is strongly unlikely and might result in a warning. Due to the sheer amount of people given warnings for this (if it even happens), hopefully Blizz would consider an implementation of their own.
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means.  
---
&gt; Determine if an AddOn is loaded on demand (via .toc file dependencies or LoadAddOn ) rather than at startup
---
I think you're going to be shocked just how much easier things are in 2019 versus 2006.
---
"Updated" to remove their functionality.  Have you got the XML or the LUA?
---
EDIT: All this did was change the Interface ID to 1.13.  Which probably means they're keeping the addon in place, but gutting functionality and providing a stub so that the client doesn't display the Token UI in the Auction House.
---
If your raid allows you to throw up a non-dps debuff like VE. You have a shit raid.
---
Haha
---
It doesn't even mean that.  Some addons are always loaded, and some are only loaded the first time you try to use them.  Like all of AtlasLoot isn't going to be loaded into memory, it will load the piece you need when you first choose the dungeon or zone, etc.

Hi! I'm looking for casual or semi-hardcore guild that's focused on raiding and plans to go all the way through Naxx.  I'll be playing on NA servers and am on CST.
---
Depending on which faction the guild is, I'll either be playing a Holy Paladin on Alliance or a Resto Druid for Horde.  I'll also pick up Alchemy as a profession to help the guild with consumables, and also Enchanting if the guild is in need of a guild Enchanter.
---
My available days for raiding are Monday and Tuesday. PM me if you think I'd a good fit.
---
IT'S THE EYEBLEEDING DEFAULT XP THEME!

# KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!!

Lol

Or an elemental shammy. But your point still stands. Heals need peels.
---
I am my own family and the 20 mins is the total of 4 jerking off sessions of 5 mins each.
---
how did this comment end up being the top comment so fast? do people really think its not a problem due to this?
---
Summer lasts until Sept 23.
---
I'm fine with this. Leveling two characters seems like the chore of a lifetime haha. Someone should go for the cap, stream it for charity.
---
Thanks for clarifying, but the main point was against that it doesn't just make it not a thing.
---
Probably just as difficult as Tanaris though, if not more. It's difficult but possible to get through Felwood without dying. Timbermaw Hold, on the other hand, is a death slog.
---
It's easier to be decent at mage than lock. But yes if you really get into it, mages can get super complex. But you don't need to do all that to be effective.
---
City of heroes
---
Actually, that simply means that the Addon will be loaded even if you never open the relevant thing.  All Blizzard Addons are non-load on demand, because they're always loaded.
---
unless you have another possible date that they have hinted at, it definitely reinforces the possibility it wasnt just tinfoil. but whatever dude. im 99% sure its gonna release july 16th. its also a tuesday and blizz loves tuesdays. its a great chance.
---
Many do but 15 bucks a month is ok, 30 is unreasonable to most unless they are boxing.

Exactly.  It doesn't mean anything one way or the other.

I wonder if the the oceanic servers will have smaller player no.'s compared to the other larger regions?
---
Comparing new models vs old is like comparing the new sonic from the movie coming out vs the original sonic- Cringey garbage
---
Starting to loath this meme format.
---
1: More of just a young and inexperienced with the world, but I remember being mystified with why the game was blurring every time I tried typing "Furbong" (was trying to type Furbolg). Asked my parents and they just kinda tugged at their collars and were like "no clue son".
---
2: Needed a rogue to pick lock the door for DM so our lock could do his mount quest, already a full 5 man party, no problem, let's just convert this to a raid so we can summon him and boot him once he gets the door for us. Forgot to change it back to party afterwards. Nobody in the group knew why it didn't give him quest completion beating the demon there so I had that going for me.
---
#3: Leveling as a hunter and stuck to my pet till level 35ish before upgrading him to a tiger in STV, had no clue you needed to constantly get new pets to upgrade growl and rend.

I figured as much, still pretty crushing to hear it confirmed but I guess this leaves me with more time to spend here yippie...
---
almost blizz like
---
It's just water.  You can fish all kinds of nasty things out of it.
---
I'm pretty sure it does hurt Horde players. It's functionally lava, as far as I know.
---
Was this patched at some point? I remember you could fish in it, but I also remember having to bandage after falling into it.
---
A lot of the difficulty of Vanilla raiding is preparation rather than execution. I actually like that.
---
Way more then that honestly. It's not until you get the end talents in shadow that things start to shift heavily towards spells being your primary damage.
---
Even then you still rely on your wand because you need to manage your regen windows to avoid downtime.
---
The game was designed for a 2500 player cap, and is not based solely off of a hardware limitation. This means that, even though hardware is magnitudes more powerful today, the cap may likely still be 2500.
---
I am deeply disgusted.
---
You are remembering incorrectly
---
It is not
---
Unique to WoW is that in it's Vanilla form it literally does not exist in an officially playable form. When Insomniac remasters Ratchet and Clank, whether I like it or not I can go back and play the original on my PS2/3 or ported console. Vanilla not existing is like Insomniac came into the players home and burned their copy of Ratchet and Clank in front of them while simultaneously destroying every other copy in the world. The player is then told that if they want to play Ratchet and Clank they will have to buy the new version and if they try and emulate the original through software they'll be sued to death 
---
"Surely, its the gameplay which is the main draw, and considering many games companies are currently developing re-masters using state of the art graphics (and ploayers loving it), why does the wow classic community want all the old look?"
---
You are making two correlations and assuming they're exclusive. I love Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon and was very happy they were remastered. I played both of those remasters and enjoyed them a lot BUT there were some minor gameplay quirks and in Crash Bandicoot's case some graphical changes that looked terrible(mostly lighting effects.) As a fan I honestly would have preferred a simple re-release with MAYBE some updated textures so things display right or are easier to see on modern monitors. Though I will say I felt the Spyro remaster was an absolute triumph mostly because it allowed the player to listen to the original soundtrack. It just looked and felt very good to me.
---
The same goes for Vanilla WoW. Players don't want a "remastered" experience. They want a port. Similar to the Final Fantasy titles being ported to Nintendo Switch.
---
That was in reference to the beta.
---
It's a matter of tradeoffs. Sure, DS can get you a few percent more damage in pve, but there's a lot to be said for being 90% as good at both without having to respec. For most groups that'll be more than enough
---
i agree with you but the fact that Call of Duty is still considered a "new game title" is hilarious. 
---
Its like people who buy every fifa and nba 2Kxx. isnt it just the same shit? i dont get it
---
Willing to bet we've all watched it multiple times
---
I would totally sell items for flask of the Titans materials:
---
I know quite a few older people that still play it. The kind of older people who's kids have moved out and they have all of this extra money burning a hole in their pocket and would probably be at the casino burning it but instead probably burn it on candy crush.
---
Thats good to hear, does anyone know if the guards aggro will reset if you jump in?
---
Now that I think about it, I also remember falling in a lot trying to get to the spot below the flight master. I guess I would remember dying more if it were like the elevator.
---
Maybe my bad memories are just because I kept falling in. It's been 12+ years.
---
unless you change the loot settings.
---
...this is often what lead to scrolling through forums
---
It's not gonna be Beta-so-dark-you-need-a-torch-offhand but I imagine we'll have something close to the original. Mid-late Vanilla nights.
---
They even went back and redid all the painted on shadows for Vanilla-Mode graphics.
---
My irl friends and I would dress our horde toons up in that garb and take screenshots of us sitting in all the alliance inns. We created a guild &lt;Tourist&gt; and had rules on how to behave around "the locals". Even though we were on a PvP server we never attacked other players and only killed town guards in order to get the screenshot. RP walk/ride speed only and be polite with your emotes. 
---
It was a ton of fun. At first alliance would run away or attack, but after a few minutes of emoting they got the idea and mostly would play along. Other horde would see us and want to join the guild. Met a lot of people doing that.
---
Because I don't enjoy being corpse camped by players 10+ levels higher than me who I have no chance of killing?
---
Golden age of gaming was like 1998-2011. We can't leave out pre-wow blizzard, the original xbox, the ps2, and the n64, along with Halo, Super Smash Bros (original and melee), WoW of course, Diablo, Ultima Online, Runescape, Everquest.
---
Yeah im not sure but saw a few people saying that but maybe they just thinking generally and not about more pvp focused which thats the type of player i am.
---
There's a typo in the Kalimdor map, in the southeast corner of Winterspring it's supposed to say Darkwhisper Gorge, but it says "Da**s**kwhisper Gorge".
---
Didn't that shut down years ago?
---
Paladins are not weak? Unless of course you mean prot or ret. 
---
Holy paladins are the best single target healers and the beat defensive healers in classic.
---
Ion on twitter confirmed there would only be a pretty small amount of servers for launcy

---
Is it an authentic vanilla experience without the 600+ ping?
---
Where do you think everyone else started. You‚Äôll be fine.
---
Yeah I was talking about ret/prot. I played holy paladin for a few expansions (cata, mop), I'm not looking to heal in classic haha
---
They announced it at Blizzcon in the US. It would be silly for them to announce it at Blizzcon using another country's callander system.
---
Warrior (Arms) or Paladin (Ret)
---
I am really torn between Warrior and Paladin ATM. I have always loved the class fantasy of the Paladin since vanilla but i eventually rolled Warrior because my friend told me pally's sucked and they still had a similar feel (plate armor and 2h weapon) i wasnt comfortable healing back then because i was so new to the game and didnt want to be a detriment.
---
this time around I am still sort of having the same dilemma. I plan on mostly doing PvP and trying to grind out Rank 14 again. I still plan on doing raids of course but mainly as a means to get the gear we need.
---
Due to their higher demand My original plan was just to tank or off tank as a warrior, or heal as a paladin in order to get the gear I need, but the more i think about it and the more i watch videos about how classic/vanilla was i'm beginning to doubt if that plan would actually work or be viable.
---
\-Warriors-
---
a raid only need 2/3 tanks and i know fury warriors are pretty up there in terms of dps, but if im the tank/off tank would there be a lot of competition? and would i only get second priority dps gear? should i just roll with the fury warrior and try and get the gear that way? can you off tank with an arms spec?
---
\-Pally-
---
with there being more healer spots in a raid i figured a raid can always use some more healers so there would be less competition but the same thing goes for rolling on the dps gear/weapons, could I be Ret spec but still do decent healing after slapping on some healing gear? I remember Ret pally's being a huge meme back in the day, with people being older and more knowledgeable this time around im not sure if they will be more accepting of them this run. Paladins also get that epic mount from their quest; i know gold is really hard to get and that could save me some money but idk how valuable that is later down the line everyone gets their epic mount eventually (Plus judgment set is amazing...)
---
I remember warriors were a beast in PvP. but i have Little-to-No knowledge of how ret pally's performed in PvP, were they still pretty good? both the classes were equally gear dependent im assuming
---
at the end of the day I would be content playing either of these classes, i just want to make it through the end game smoothly and get the gear i need without too much hassle from the raids/guild im in.  Im probably going to level both eventually with whoever i dont pick as my alt.
---
This post ended up being a lot longer that i had planned lol but thank you for taking your time to read it!
---
To Greyhawk. ;)
---
It might give some helpful items when leveling. But blacksmithing is notoriously hard to keep up. I would recommend going with engineering unless there's some BoP blacksmithing items you really want.
---
I would highly recommended watching StormX‚Äôs pvp videos, he is a literal god at Druid pvp. Plus he list his builds and what not. I‚Äôve never considered playing a Druid but after watching this guy 1vx against numerous enemies, a lot of which are geared and better players I was genuinely shocked. Check him out https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Same in NZ. I think they hooked up to a new line cause in a period of a year, internet speed on average went up. Now hooked to fiber. Average Speed is 5x that.
---
you got downvoted, but if two people are similar class loot types, its not a problem, but its def a con.
---
Ahh! Well I'm a warlock main since tbc and will be playing warlock.
---
I'm torn between rogue and hpali alt I'll prob level both eventually but my dedicated alt will be hpali.
---
Locks are already really good at pvp...rogues are just a totally so playstule.
---
I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Alex but he‚Äôs right to post this, tinfoil hat or not. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this, and it might prove helpful to know and take action before it‚Äôs too late?
---
That's why I said it's usually slower.  Some classss like war can level faster in duos though if they can get some healing.
---
Lowest level above the waterline, I think in either the same building as the guy who gives "Scaring Shaky" or the building next to his.
---
playing on classic servers.
---
That's what inspired this :).
---
Lmao I'm gonna be so slow. I said I love these in response to "Math Thursday" posts that you make. I was actually just thinking I haven't seen one in awhile.
---
Shitty emo songs remind me of Vanilla WoW since I was deep into my blunder years around that point.

But more so whenever I hear that clip on the Simpsons ‚ÄúLISA NEED BRACES‚Äù ‚ÄúDENTAL PLAN‚Äù

I‚Äôm transported to barrens chat.
---
I feel the same way but this year is supposed to be a big year for CoD since all rumors point to MW4
---
I need to get mine recovered/unlocked, who do I reach out to? (What email/phone/etc)
---
It did indeed, i think it was late 2012 that they closed it down. Apparently some group gathered up and ran a secret server for 6 years since then like 100-200 population. I presume they got pretty bored with such a low pop and someone "leaked" its existence. Now they have 4 server shards with thousands playing. So far having a blast playing it again.
---
Either Orc or Human Warlock
---
May 5th quote me on that
---
You'd be surprised how many play them. Candy Crush games are installed automatically on a fresh installation of Windows - even Pro version.
---
CoD is theoretically more profitable, but it's not consistent nor sustainable anymore.  
---
There are free to play game that are better, and offer the same micro transaction system.  
---
CoD sales have been decreasing, and players aren't staying. This kills the online aspect of the game, therefore less people purchase micro transaction. 
---
Activision needs to either make a good F2P game, or create a new franchise.
---
Thanks for the tips. :D
---
Yeah i plan to go engineering just not sure for second ;p
---
Because saying mid year or second half of the year or naming a month would be silly?
---
Feed your bear before it books it

Paladin quest at 20. Druid quest for water form. I absolutely loved these. I loved running to Blackfathom or Silverpine talking to the group, getting to know the group.
---
I tried Legion, and a little BfA and in all the dungeon runs I don't think anyone said a word to each other. Made me wish I was playing a single player game.
---
Or when that BOE Epic drops...
---
Lowest level, all the way around from the boat dock
---
This video makes me have the feel goods that they are honestly trying to deliver us something that they are proud of and honest to vanilla wows original form. Obviously issues with newer gen tech and the old system but they seem to "get it" and are doing their best. 
---
Hype was confirmed here. I just re-watched it today and boy'o'boy am I excited.
---
Just chiming in to spew wrong shit you have no clue about? This must be /r/classicwow.
---
Makes sense.  
---
For example I just did the Naga island in BB for Akiris Reed.  It‚Äôs really compact up top and it woulda been hell to kite with an Imp, but VW did the trick.
---
Going **Mage** and **Druid alt** for Classic. Playing resto Shaman right now and even though it gets the job done in raids it fails short on the fun side and capabilities. So mage for main DPS character with AoE farming while druid will be for healing/tanking utility alt to call when needed to heal/tank something, gear from some farm runs etc. Doing some mage practice right now, although I'm 6/10 compared to what people pull off on videos :)
---
For professions I'm starting with **skinning/mining** and then somewhere at 60 start dropping it for final ones. **Tailoring** will be *needed*, not sure if super permanent or not, **herbalism/alchemy** likely for druid although adding **enchanting** is also an option due to mage AoE farming cloth (although many seems want to run it so it may be just DE on bank alt).
---
My biggest fear is having to roll for a BoE Epic against a friend.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk20no/blizzard_updating_wow_token_files_in_classic/

as you can see from the upvote/downvote ratio on this post no one seems to really care / trust the classic guys too much
---
What?
---
Well I would still have garbage speed if I hadn't moved. I've heard that NZ internet is pretty good. AUS is pretty hit and miss.
---
Play paladin and your only job is to flash of light your warrior buddy. its real easy.
---
I don't know, he doesn't have a video card at all and has a top mounted power supply. Computer is clearly a potato.
---
Thanks for sharing.  I have a second warlock sitting at 10 I may try this out with.  Right now I‚Äôm just leveling to get down strategy so I have no problem trying this out.  You felt okay without Imp Drain Soul mana recovery?  I know it‚Äôs not great late, but feels good early on.  Probably less casting and more kiting and letting the Imp do the mana spend?
---
Look at the commit, this change is applied to every module, most likely through a script. So no, nothing to see here.
---
Ill go Mining and Engineering i think you suggested that earlier seems like a fine combo if i do a second class i can do two different ones on that ;p
---
The winters chill spec absolutely does not have shatter. Shatter is worthless in PvE.
---
The golden ratio of a meme vortex
---
Yea that's why I would prefer if they used only new visuals. My argument is that wanting old shitty visuals is a nostalgia choice. The problem with retail wow isn't how it looks it's how it plays. Even when it came out the graphics were considered very low fidelity. That worked great at the time because the amazing graphical style more than made up for the low poly models, and having low requirements was great back in the voodoo2 and 56k days.
---
I'm fucking hyped either way though, lol.
---
They won't.
---
They can reach you in the water. So prepare for Abomination hugs!
---
Warriors also have to swap from prot to fury in pve and arms to pvp, so slowest grinding time and most respecs
---
I very well may go priest, what's the reason for priest over paladin though?
---
...we are not worthy
---
Saw that recently and was freaked out- it's such a money trap for many people!
---
I played a game similar to Clash of Clans (build a castle, fight people) and it was astounding the money-sink it would be.  The highest tier of people would spend a hundred $ a month/ EASILY, and also spend huge amounts of their time playing the game.  It's the highest % of folks that contribute t he most by far.
---
Farming consumables for raids / pvp every week, assuming you don't have a steady gold supply from playing the AH
---
obvious troll is obvious
---
2mb is still pretty good.... in australia.
---
Maybe you're thinking of the sludge in Naxx? It looks pretty similar, in a similar environment, and it hurts/debuffs you.
---
I hear you man... Pally vs Priest is SUCH a tough call... Benediction is definitely awesome, but the paladin mounts are ALSO often. ARGH....
---
Jesus christ people still watch Alexensual?
---
Did anyone actually think it was coming in June though?
---
If I‚Äôm busy, sorry little dude. I‚Äôve had a raid dissolve because I got involved in WPvP in STV and people got pissed. Maybe toss them a buff a PWS and a renew. If they can‚Äôt win with that help, sucks to suck. 
---
If I‚Äôm not busy, Red=Dead. I welcome the chaos of world PvP and I have no problem suffering while leveling. I‚Äôm in no rush to hit 60.
---
the experience with mmos, for sure mattered, I 100% agree. 
---
In regards to group finder, ye I agree, finding people felt way more satisfying back  then.
---
I hope there will be an addon for it.
---
There's a new 20/0/31 ret/holy spellpower build floating around that goes for spell healing+power gear, that caps out Illumination. It's theoretically the most competitive paladin dps spec, and you get full access to all of your healing, as well as have healing gear.
---
It hasnt caught on and you might get ret stigma if you start playing just dps, but I dont think Shadow, Feral, Ret, or Ele/enh are very favored socially in the current ecosystem. Play what you want.
---
Lol when I read the beginning of that I thought they were going to say WoW classic is their most important release.
---
That's the thing about with each successive expansion, rewards got a little bit easier to get and there was less and less need to talk to strangers. And our brains over time and expansions adjusted to the simplified nature of Warcraft, and it's something that some people will have to be mindful of see if they can go back to the way they used to think
---
Go onto your accounts page on the Blizz battle net and click on support / contact us. There's a short form to fill out, super easy.
---
From Google (this applies to the fall equinox too):
---
"The March equinox would occur on the same day every year if the Earth took exactly 365 days to make a complete revolution around the Sun. ... This means that each March equinox occurs about 6 hours later than the previous year's March equinox. This is why the date of the equinox can change from year to year."

So a summer release really isn't confirmed, outside of confirming it won't launch in the spring.

---
I played vanilla, and I'm 99% certain that at some point it did hurt you to be in the slime. Private servers are not totally blizzlike.
---
I know Blizz has been unusually cool with classic thus far, but they still don't deserve your trust yet. I doubt they'd implement this classic, but I'm 100% okay with people preemptively complaining because that's the only way to get their attention lately. This isn't the same blizzard we grew up with.
---
Engineering is pretty easy to level as well. I spent about 70g leveling 1-250 on a private server, leveling tailoring like that would cost at least 3 times as much and enchanting maybe 5 times as much. And few gadgets need 300 anyways. 
---
Mining is a solid choice, especially when leveling. The goggles give you some much needed stamina way before you can even find head slot items. 
---
Another thing I forgot about engineering is that dynamites and grenades are very good for pulling. Discounting holy shock, your max range ability is like 10 yards which makes it quite hard to do pulls in dungeons if you are tanking. So just throwing a dynamite is a good way of doing it. 
---
Lastly, the quest for gnomish or goblin engineering is not entirely cheap while leveling, so you might want to delay that a bit. You should probably read through all the unique items you can use. Fortunately you can drop your specialisation and choose another, which you can't with blacksmithing and leatherworking. Now because all the goblin/gnome exclusive items only need the relevant specialisation to craft the item, you can go gnome first, craft all the unique stuff, then respec into goblin and make all of those uniques. At least on private servers, I'd probably ask around a bit before doing that on Classic hehe.
---
Sunwell... I think I walked in there like 10 levels later and still got my ass handed to me instantly.
---
Thank you for hiding the bears identity, wouldn't want poachers coming in and gunning him down.
---
Replace P server with more burnout LOL
---
Kern confirmed that the absolute peak was 4k, but that they would force login queues long before that. Realistically the servers were *maxed* out at 3500.
---
Do you even speak English?
---
I'd like a toggle. Literally wouldn't effect anyone else but yourself. I'm looking forward to classic, but the old models -are- pretty ugly these days. But hey that's just my opinion.
---
I'm pretty sure it used to at one point, a tiny amount of damage.  I can't find it in patch notes though.
---
You don't even need to go indie, just stay out of the mainstream AAA line up. Games like path of exile and sekiro have sucked in my time like no other, and they're both published games. From Software is even AAA but they buck the bullshit trends of the mainstream AAA games.
---
The reason i was asking is because my friend and I were trying to determine if we were going to play horde or alliance based of rogues trolling town. I used to do this in TBC with Stormwind, but wasn't sure if we could do this in Undercity. Thank you guys for the info. The choice is now clear.
---
Wow... a lot of confusing responses!  
---
I would recommend reading through some of the Mage/Warlock class threads on this sub-reddit for a better overview of each class.  
---
Personally, I think for solo play on a PvP server, you're a little better off with a Warlock, but it's close. The playstyle is quite different, as a Mage has slightly better reactive capabilities and CC, making movement while engaging a little easier, but a Warlock has better survivability - especially if the player has properly maintained their shards. (I mean, as a warlock, if someone tries to gank you, simply fear them into a pack of mobs, apply dots and then run off with a laugh).  
---
Both are viable in raids, both are viable in groups, both are viable in PvP. Warlocks have more commands, which requires more keybinds. Mages require a little more forethought and the ability to anticipate your opponents actions for consistency in PvP, as well as a keen eye for ones mana pool. Warlock require careful management of their pets.  
---
Both scale well with engineering, and you're pretty much locked into mining until that is leveled up. Then I'd recommend you drop mining and switch to tailoring (you'll want to craft some epic robes - The Archmages robes, I think?). For leveling professions, you can try to level them as you level your character, but for the most part, this is regarded as a waste of time, as it is FAR easier to level professions when you can gather what you need by riding around on a mount at max level, which you can farm for without having to spend time/resources on a profession.  
---
Hope that helps - good luck!
---
wishful thinking never hurt anybo-  WHY ISNT IT OUT YET? WTF!
---
HOTW is arguably optimal for AB and maybe even AV for being able to defend and contest flags so well. They don‚Äôt have much of a role in the group fights, but the small engagements they really shine.
---
Sekiro. Nothing like a challenging single player game to keep an MMO feeling fresh.
---
Spiritual healing is shit for the point investment if you are intending to do other things than heal‚Äîwhich you‚Äôve said you are. 
---
What are you intending to farm? Instance mobs? Tyrs hand? Non elites?
---
If non elites, imp swp does nothing.
---
The decrease in spell damage received is great in progression, but if getting beaten on by mobs, or jumped in pvp‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather have the crit recovery. 
---
I also wouldn‚Äôt take the threat reduction talent if your intent is to farm. You‚Äôll never pull agro off a tank regardless, and if it‚Äôs healing agro on the pull, a reduction in threat won‚Äôt make that not happen.
---
Ill need to know if Classic allows you to respect but i doubt it haha ill go with those two though and go Goblin.
---
God I wish so much that I could get pservers to work on a Mac :( but doesn't seem to work.

The quickest route to gadgetzan as a level 1 character is to go human. Run through elwynn and westfall, swim to booty bay, boat across the pond to ratchet, death run through 1k needles and ta-dah you're ready to dance naked on the gadgetzan mailbox.
---
I just found out there is a neutral AH in booty bay!  I've played this game since ship and I had no idea.
---
There is a neutral AH in Winterspring, Tanaris and STV.
---
I live in Australia and up until like a year ago 2MB/s was unreachable for me, i maxed out at about 650KB/s
---
By the bank and mailbox, at the edge of the innermost pier. You pass by the inn on your way there.
---
80$ a month for 4/1 that also goes out for random amounts of time near weekly.

You do not not any resistance gear for the vast majority of vanilla raiding.
---
Are you telling me that November and December are Summer months?
---
i recovered my old account in like 10 minutes with their live chat customer support.   they asked things like old Email, if i knew any characters, server, etc.
---
Careful, the haters will tell you you‚Äôre just wasting your time and burning out while they do pet battles in BFA lol
---
Divinity 2 scratches that RPG itch for my every now and then. I have over 150 hours on it.
---
Merging multiple low pop servers after the huge release explosion is easy and makes the most sense
---
Hahaha, that is amazing! A while back I was playing on a private server and I stumbled on the passage between the hinterlands and western plaguelands for the first time in my life. For 14 freaking years I had no idea that little road existed.
---
The flight path even flies RIGHT OVER IT lol.
---
Tbh, that's inevitable.
---
Yeah the spellpower build looks like it's the strongest build for Ret right now, and it retains healing capacity. It takes gear nobody cares about, doesn't take warrior gear, and it can heal and dps pretty viably. 
---
Some video tests are showing it blowing way past dps checks with incomplete consumables. Crowd Pummeler SP ret is the new meta.
---
People love to hate on him but he has been right about some things most people gave him crap for. Like when he was exposing the corruption on Ely no one believed him at first, just a crazy conspiracy theorist.
---
I imagine it will be significantly more prevalent this time around since it's such a common thing in retail these days. The argument that "there's less gold in classic" doesn't really make sense because the pricing would just scale down.
---
Summer is from June 21 to September 23.  Were you really expecting a "Summer '19" release date to be in the first 10 days of summer?
---
Based on the discussion I've seen here I suspect people are confusing school calendar summer with the actual season of summer.
---
I love the new Dwarf models. I would be a little bit sad for a day or two if there was no way to use the updated models.
---
Warlock will be much more low stress. No one will notice if you use the "okay" pvp/pve spec because you aren't going to be topping meters anyway\*. In pvp you don't have to worry about positioning and kiting like a mage. In farming you don't have to worry about getting good enough at kiting to be able to pull maximum amount of mobs. You don't need as many rank 1 keybinds as a mage. You won't be expected to be a flag carrier in WSG pubs. If you run succubus you can get free CC off without worrying about fake casting.
---
(someone who doesn't care about min/maxing is not going to get into a guild that clears AQ/Naxx)
---
&gt;wasn't even close to Sunwell
---
wut. Twins were up for 2 days, Muru &amp; Kiljaeden were up for 5 days
---
Tauren male's walking animation always looked horrible to me. The way their arms kind of drift out to the sides and up a bit looks like the fencing response when someone is knocked out/concussed.
---
Yea, I'm well aware of the situation in Aus, my mate works at the NBN.  
---
At one point I think NZ were slower than Aus. But during 2010s, speed has been slowly increasing, even for copper wire users.  
---
The fiber roll out here is pretty quick, but NZ is a small nation afterall, and large population live in Auckland.
---
I asked a twink how he made enough gold to buy some of the items. He told me kill chickens in elwynn forest and they have a chance to drop wings that vendor for 1000g. Naturally, being 11 I believed him and killed them for hours. :)
---
A lot of this sub, tbh.
---
250 Thunder Bluff rep.
---
I've been told that the classic alpha client does not have updated models but I hope that was incorrect. That wouldn't stop the modding scene from adding them in though if they were. Back in TBC/WotLK the modding scene made updated models for all of the druid forms and they looked pretty awesome.
---
The vast majority of people I've seen on this sub says either July or August. In fact, I've seen quite a few people even suggest September which would be pretty sad in my opinion.
---
Ah yes, the guild killer.
---
damn those forearms tho. he never skips farmer walks
---
This... supports his argument?
---
Repeated  not bad
---
Dope, I'm expecting the vanilla models but I'm kinda hoping I can play with updated models since it doesnt affect gameplay (which is why I'm there) a toggle feature would just be the best option for me
---
YouTube wasn't far behind and Conquest famously had a bunch of videos and very detailed guides. I'm not arguing your core tenant -- people will blitz through Classic because the depth of knowledge people have in their classes is much higher nowadays -- but there was definitely cookie cutter strats in retail.
---
Time to first kill tells you very little about boss difficulty. 90% of the time it‚Äôs about bugs, gating, strategy and gear checks. If you could see wipes to kill it would look completely different to days to kill, especially for guilds out of the top 20 (where strategy is well known).
---
I just wanna see people running around the map again
---
Nah, because there's so much competition, it's easy to be better than shit tons of people. Tons of players half ass their raiding, so if you put the effort in, it's pretty easy to be on the top end of your guild's melee.
---
Care to wager on that? I'm 99% sure it's not releasing on July 16th
---
Raids have been cleared in 30 minutes. With that said that‚Äôs a minority of players that will pull that off until vastly overhearing the content.
---
I just leveled a lock to 40 on private server. Soul shard management is actually super annoying. I might be in the minority on that but for me, it was hella annoying. Also the leveling spec is sooooo bad for world pvp, when i respeced to nightfall conflag build i had fun for the first time

Drinking and trying and failing to run 5 mans that should be easy when sober.
---
for pvp rank 10 gear is pretty good for locks, you won't be a beast but it has good spell damage and stamina. Same with T1 and T2.
---
Female nelf hunter duh

Im saying blizzard is loose w lips
---
MT is 95% gear so pick the one you think looks best.  I guess if you want to min/max go with troll.
---
ya its shit, retails got its own problems for sure but i'd still be putting stupid-tier hours into it if it weren't for the crbg garbage looool
---
Well it depends. I know of at least one highly skilled hunter in the private server scene who weaves melee and ranged attacks to maximize DPS, but it's not even doable until you have access to Swiftness of Zanza which is out in phase 2 and you need to be at least revered with the zandalar tribe.

I doubt there will be hard-caps.

You can turn them off by the way
---
I agree - there definitely were cookie cutter strats, I only meant that you had to look harder to find it, meaning a bunch of people didn't. I'm talking more about the earlier raids too...it took more effort to make it to where you could get an invite to Nax!
---
Hi, /u/OverKast78
---
Can confirm. Roommate could finish a recent Final Fantasy, but STILL plays Clash of Clans
---
The catch is the pristine yeti hide is unique and you have to go back to the quest giver every time to turn in before farming another. A bit tedious.
---
But you‚Äôd be havin a good time, HAVING A GOOD TIME

I look forward to when 3d graphics are a thing again.  Looking at my start menu now, its something that literally can be created in 5 minutes on Paint.
---
Seriously. Fucking 05 lol ok. Ocarina of Time came out in 1998. N64 had been out, and Rare had games released on SNES. SEGA was still a competitor back then (sort of, maybe).
---
Yeah I don't understand all the push back when it's completely optional.
---
wat, male orc has second best cast animation by far xD
---
\&gt;No YouTube, only printed guides and information moved much slower then
---
What??
---
Vanilla came out in November, 2004.
---
Youtube opened up and started sharing videos in March, 2005.
---
One of the most famous vanilla WoW videos, Leeroy Jenkins, was posted in May, 2005.
---
The only raid that existed prior to Youtube was Molten Core, and only for a brief 4.5 months.
---
Black Wing Lair didn't come out till June, 2005.
---
Molten Core had walkthroughs up on the web within a few days of the first guilds completing it.
---
Information didn't move slower at all that's nonsense.
---
The toggle already exists in retail and it has not caused any confusion.   So no, no one has to admit that because it's blatantly false
---
That's not how addons work.
---
I wouldn't put it off as air totems are some of the best. But it's good to know that the quest is basically just talking to a guy and gives you a pretty nice (1hr?) buff that increases move speed and attack speed. I'd plan some content around it, but again I wouldn't put it off
---
It's because the people that want to force the old models on everyone else think they are better and only their opinion should matter.   It's pure narcissism.
---
I was actually thinking about this last night as I was going to bed, in 2 weeks I‚Äôll think of the release date
---
&gt; Warriors also have to swap from prot to fury in pve
---
Most don't tho. MTs spec prot / fury. OTs spec fury and toss on a shield occasionally.
---
I‚Äôll do it after the first 4-5 weeks of classic
---
&gt;You needed fire resist gear in Vanilla to down trash mobs
---
 What mobs are you talking about?  Your guild might have been having problems because it was telling everyone to change into fire resist gear...
---
Is making a pvp alt uncommon
---
&gt; I mean, if a priest needs a druids innervate to stay relevant who's the real oomer?
---
A Priest doesn't *need* it to stay relevant.  It's simply a matter of expecting your healers to be required to manage their mana in a raid.  None of your healers can just heal with 100% uptime and not run out of mana (outside of downranking, to an extent).  The presumption in a raid is that all of your casters will run out of mana if they just push their highest dps/hps throughput 100%.
---
So, if you have Innervates in your raid, they are probably best spent on your Priests.  Priests will get the most return from an Innervate, so it's simply a practical matter.  If you're going to use the Innervate *at all*, you might as well use it where it's probably going to be most valuable.
---
Back when they allowed all the caster DPS cooldowns to stack, I specced into Power Infusion for a little while to test with.  I used my PI cooldowns on the Mages when I could stack it with their Arcane Power and trinkets and such, not on myself.  Not because the Mages *needed* it to stay relevant, but because it was simply a bigger boost to the raid's dps to do it that way.
---
If your raid members are minding their incidental damage, and your healers are managing their mana fine, then using it on a Mage is the best DPS character class to use it on, because Mages get the most return from Spirit.  After Mages, it's technically Warlocks.  Then Balance Druids.
---
It's a matter of practicality, not relevancy.
---
Now, again, if the pre-~1.10 bug is actually bugged on release, a Druid can exploit it by running DMC: Blue Dragon, then they can use Innervate on themselves if they stack it with the trinket proc.  It's *still* better used on a Priest with Blue Dragon, if you can stack it with a trinket proc from the Priest.  And eventually, Blue Dragon stops being a relevant trinket entirely.  But, the trinket is 5x better if the bug isn't fixed.  (I presume the bug will be in a fixed state, though).
---
Oh yeah dude was right, I thought the meme was pretty funny all the same though.
---
This question reminds me of when I was playing wow for the first time with my friend, we both made an undead, he got to undercity first than me, when I got there I asked him "can i jump on this slime or it'll kill me?", then he said "well, this is where undeads take a shower, so you'll be fine".
---
This is what I‚Äôm banking on. I don‚Äôt know the login and it will be an ancient email I can‚Äôt remember from my childhood. But what I do know are the names of all the characters, the cd key used to activate the account, what servers I had guys on, etc. The account has not been touched since Wotlk.
---
Yeah generally our region has ~10% the population of NA
---
It was possible to upload data generated by an addon in 2005 to a website to display guild bank contents. Surely it's still possible in Classic.

What I would do for a modern version of this game.
---
hurrdurr did you click the link to understand what hes talking about?
---
The end of Summer so mid August - End of Sept (Personally I'm assuming late August)
---
Calm down lmao
---
Here's what I'd recommend.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0xoZZEd0tbcq
---
On the ret side benediction helps with downtime on killing shit due to seals being most of what you'll spend mana on. I took points out of SoTC because you're usually better off by just opening with a JoC instead of JoTC as it's likely you'll kill the thing before the %holy damage makes a difference. Pursuit of justice should always be a must have. Movement speed is like crack cocaine, you don't miss it until you don't have it.
---
On the holy side I went for spiritual focus instead of strength. Sure the drop is DPS is less than desired but spiritual focus is one of the defining characteristics of a holy paladin. Pop on aura of concentration and you'll get no heal pushback which is absolutely fantastic. It makes pulling multiple mobs a non issue as your health pool is now your mana pool. Without it two mobs will be fairly difficult and three will be pretty much impossible without BoP or bubble.
---
In the end though, play how you want. You play to have fun. If you want to min/max I'd recommend rolling an alt that can actually kill things without gimp speccing yourself.
---
I played my holy paladin a shit ton in vanilla with no other alt other than a couple of twinks. My method of dealing with this was speccing holy for raiding for the few days of the week we did. Afterwards I'd spec back and then go kill the elite mobs in the scarlet crusade area in Eastern Plaguelands until I got 100 gold to spec back and forth again. Granted, this is when I managed to DKP my way into a [Zin'rokh](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=19854) so I had a pretty decent ret setup for soloing elites.
---
Before that I had a hybrid spec like you're aiming for but it was a different patch so I can't even remember what I picked in it. I did top the healing meters pretty consistently but my raiding group, like many MC raiding groups, had 30 people who pressed buttons and 10 people who actually had their shit together.
---
This is a pretty good idea. I definitely cannot help or offer any suggestions as this is pretty over my head, just wanted to say that this is a good idea. c:
---
This would make it easier to have PvP limited to one realm
---
Thanks for the support!
---
That's what I was thinking, too.
---
September 23, last day of summer
---
I uninstall Candy Crush and Disney Magic Kingdom and they keep showing back up on my new W10 PC :/ like all those stupid office apps on tablets, can't get rid of em
---
sure it may be but I know personally 5+ people who have done it since retail TBC and havnt ceased since. Never banned, so forgive me if I dont believe you when you say they would get banned.
---
Not really sure, I just can‚Äôt be fucked to not only level but also gear an alt.
---
IIRC melee weave playstyle for hunter is only enabled by the swiftness of zanza consumable, so you need to wait until phase 2 and be revered with the zandalar tribe before you can pull it off.
---
This is awesome but far too detailed for the average viewer and won't get the karmic love it deserves as a result. Definitely forwarding to my friend that's rolling pally for the first time. Thanks man
---
You can do it on ouro if you bring LIPs. Still pretty questionable.
---
Illidan was up for like 15 days. Archimonde was up forever, Kael'thas was up forever, Vashj was up for months too.
---
we'll see.
---
pretty much exact same situation i had lol.
---
Maybe I like living life on the edge, but melee weave is fairly doable on mag with a greater fire protection pot and glimmering mithril insignia since you can feign trinket swap after it goes on cooldown.
---
Of course, you'd need to be a blacksmith to do that which not everybody's going to want to be.
---
UD warlock here, looking for a semi-hc raid group.   
---
My schedule is my biggest problem. I'm in PST, and end work at 5pm pst, some days off early. Currently takes me about 10-15m to get home. My work schedule can be a bother, as 1 week out of each month, im on-call; some days i simply cannot be there or have to leave early / show up late, while others i get lucky and no problems. I can always notify raid lead ahead of time. There is a second week that is shared on-call among employees, in which we essentially ask who is available and or willing for the OT on those days. That week can be a toss-up and a lot of schedule trading happens (i usually offer to work Fri/Sat if i want to raid mid-week).   
---
What I bring to the table:   
---
1) Dedication to the raid when I am available, along with generally being a good player having attention to mechanics and studying my class for optimization. I make mistakes, though I tend to learn fast and not consistently make the same ones. I may be casual, but I play hard and serious when I can play. 
---
2) Previous raid experience. I raided through 4 horsemen in naxx as NE druid in vanilla. I was in two of the top 3 raiding alliance guilds on Kel'Thuzad.   
---
3) I will likely be bringing two other players (currently looking to play shaman and priest, otherwise the priest is possibly willing to rogue or tank)  which will have near 100% raid attendance. These players have been RL friends of mine and played together since vanilla, and are honestly some of the best parsing for their retail characters on server, who are in semi-hardcore mythic guilds. They consistently perform well and know their classes like the back of their hand.   
---
4) Due to my inconsistency in raid attendance, i am willing to farm mats and contribute to guild bank in my spare time, beyond what my character needs. Locks farm easy, and its my way of contributing in place of attendance.   
---
Ultimately, I consider myself a 1st string bench, while my friends are core starters. I don't expect a guaranteed spot, but i would like to try and get in during the weeks I know I am 100% available and not on-call.
---
You are a warrior not a rogue. You're meant to be in the muck of the battle, taking on rage and dishing out heavy crits or pulling aggro. It also makes it easier for all our healers to spot us with that logic.
---
Dude healing is the most fulfilling role in pvp, if you have any interest I think you should pursue. Also echo what others have said: being bad at something is the first step towards being good at something.
---
Damn so it‚Äôs going to take tier 3 to be good as a lock In PvP? I don‚Äôt got time for that. Might as well play a hunter because at least they are good right off the bat
---
It goes pretty quick after the first tbh. My hunter took like 3-4 months, my mage took weeks iirc.
---
I am right there with you in terms of objectives. Played both warrior and mage up to Wrath. Seriously considering going for warrior again. I want to be able to do 5-man dungeons easily (as a tank) during leveling.
---
I'm very cold, do I still count? :P
---
I think it's pretty soon they said to be ready for a classic summer. Why would the summer be classic if it's at the end of it? That's just my take.
---
Uh yeah you can get one on retail. It's the same subscription.
---
Thank you for your reply! Seeing as how my friends and I like the social aspect of mmos throughout the whole experience, we‚Äôll probably level together regardless of the cons. The cons are definitely good to be aware of though so that we know what we‚Äôre in for! 
---
I was always getting ganked in vanilla, so hopefully leveling with one or two other people this time around will help alleviate my repair bill a little bit. I‚Äôm sure we will run a few dungeons with our guildies here and there throughout the leveling process to help break things up!
---
I‚Äôm sorry no.
---
Priest, Feral Drood for PvE
---
To be fair, it technically would be recreating the true vanilla experience. I know tons of people (including myself all throughout vanilla) that bought gold back in the day. I personally don't care either way if tokens are in classic.
---
It's a lot but there's lots of ways to get 25-50g per hour, so up to 4 hours per double respec. Bad but not too bad if you do stuff to make gold frequently.
---
I really like the theoretical approach and I think you should put the theory to the test and get some exp/hr  data samples.
---
I took a similar approach for my warrior-mage dualboxing combination. I did some calculation on damage/mana and dps with mage aoe abilities and it motivated a new rotation. Upon experimenting it turned out to be more efficient than my previous rotation! It was great seeing the all the spreadsheet work pay off.
---
My approach is slightly different from your approach and I'll share it below in case you are interested. Because the transit time between mobs will be relatively similar regardless of the build I don't think that variable helps you compare builds. I made this spreadsheet looking at the mage AOE abilities and estimated target kill time + recovery time. The idea with my rotation is that the warrior will take aggro on 2-3 mobs and the mage will use aoe abilities exclusively. I wanted to know the damage/mana and dps compared to single target spells. You might find my sheet relevant. The passive regen values are a bit wonky, need to do some experiments to come up with reasonable mana regen rates.

All jokes aside, the grind for item collection quests won‚Äôt be ideal, but the extra xp for clearing an area during the process might help bridge the gap a little bit. Thank you for your reply! See you in classic :)
---
Yeah that's how it got traction initially I believe

Undead. Always pick undead.

Very rural area here, I'm lucky if my speeds go beyond 1mbps, though we're paying for "up to" 20 mbps. 4G LTE plan from Verizon, at least it's unlimited. Sadly its the only non satellite option for the house until the state wide internet construction is finished here in Kentucky, it's been a few years but it's supposed to be done by late next year.
---
I can get a good 15mbps until we hit the 20 gig cap on the unlimited plan, which is when throttling kicks in.
---
Viewing pictures, changing web pages, loading gifs, downloads; those all take ages and downloads sometimes cause my tethering to disable. I miss living in a place with Broadband.
---
I'm torn though
---
During leveling a warlock can solo most classes and 2v1 hunters if they get the jump
---
Isn't it, though? I didn't know there was a new CoD til now.
---
I think most people forget just how big Sonic was back in the Genesis days
---
They already said that they will use a form of instancing initially, to handle the crush of players. It can be turned off later once population spreads out. I'm not sure where you get the 2500 limit, other than maybe private servers, and that not a good comparison if so.
---
Watch it supposed to be July 9, but blizz postpones it just so all the July 16th guys feel good.
---
I extremely doubt they would announce it less than 60 days prior.
---
I don't understand the "I want people to see my character the way I do argument" what if they want to see their character with the new models why does you wanting to see yours as the old one have any more weight than how they want to see theirs?
---
Interesting bit of information about one of the Kingdoms that I just never really thought about.

Swtor has an expansion in September, blizzard does like to time content drops like that.

Not sure that game is much competition now (though it's doing well enough to warrant another expansion which is nice to see)
---
Are there any other games coming out between june and september or otherwise dropping large content updates blizzard might want to conveniently launch classic during?
---
When you buy gold, not only are you 'paying to win', but you're also supporting account theft. That's one of the most common ways these third parties get their gold. Stolen accounts.

Never buy gold.

How in the hell is ret spelladin and spelladin taking two minutes longer to level than the rest of these at level 2? You don't have any talent points yet. There is no difference in anyway shape or form until at least level 10, which you now say is 4 minutes longer to level. Is 1 point in benediction resulting in a 16% reduction in TTL at level 10? That makes no sense.
---
It never did that's why. And i remember because the first thing i did when i got to UC as a kid was to jump in it to see if it would kill me and i was very surprised it did not.

No purpose doing the math for an eventual 1 hand spec starting with 2 hand spec gearing when you can always respec at any point.
---
One time, I organized a bunch of alliance rogues and we snuck into orgrimmar and just..spent an hour sapping people. No ganking, no murder just sapping everyone who was flagged. It was a lot of fun.
---
Ahh yeah, makes sense. I have some old screenshots somewhere..I'll look for them. I know I took one while we were raiding Naxx.
---
Yeah, you couldn't really juggle both PVP and raiding most the time. I was pretty hardcore on PVP everyday for like two months to get Field Marshal. I would've went for Grand Marshal, but it would've taken at least another month because of how crazy the people were on our server. That's when Giddy told me to join the guild, since I'd probably get an equivalent weapon via raids.

&gt; I did some calculation on damage/mana and dps with mage aoe abilities and it motivated a new rotation. Upon experimenting it turned out to be more efficient than my previous rotation! It was great seeing the all the spreadsheet work pay off.
---
If I can spend a few dozen hours to save 2-3 hours, time 100% well spent.
---

---
lol. good luck with that.
---
Thanks for the advice I never asked for nor really care about. Only bought gold in vanilla and once I could sell arena points to scrubs in TBC, I never had any more money issues. 
---
I had a great time in vanilla :)
---
Me neither and I don‚Äôt care because I won‚Äôt be buying it. I just want classic :)
---
The value of said items would be greatly decreased if such a list existed and everyone knew which ones to keep and use.
---
Furbolg wand if you are alliance.
---
Yeah. I guess you can make an argument if you said the "golden age of MMOs" in terms of popularity as WoW and Runescape were at their peak during those years, but not games in general
---
I do. I'm not sure if you do, though.
---
&gt; and won't get the karmic love it deserves
---
If you've seen my previous dumb math posts, IDGAF about karma. I got plenty elsewhere.
---
I'm here for your friend. Tell him/her to consider normal ret leveling build, but adding in spell power gear and never use more than Rank 1 Seal of Command.
---
Thank you for your reply! Yeah we might just have to roll up our sleeves and go crazy in item collection areas to make sure it doesn‚Äôt drag on for too long.
---
I leveled a character with my brother in TBC for about 30 levels and I can remember gathering quests really bothering him because of how long they‚Äôd take. Any scent of a grind in a game and he‚Äôd shy away from it. Not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I never minded grinding a little extra to be able to play with another person. The memories I made throughout my time in WoW rarely happened when playing by myself.
---
Of all the things ree'd about today in the world, this was probably the least worthwhile
---
It would probably work out better in terms of efficiency and time investment to just outlevel the gear pre 50-60 (PREpreBiS) rather than worry too much about the best weighted gear for levels 1-49.
---
Dude. I absolutely LOVED this video man. 
---
Warcraft 2 was the first computer game I ever played. So I was just super into it, and also it took me a long time to figure out how to do anything in it. But soon enough I had the gist of it, and in my eyes humans = good, orcs = bad. So imagine my shock when this mission starts off with this orange human peasants killing OTHER human peasants, which I had to kill? Or when orange human (well... technically Elven but that's just an oversight) destroyers are fighting on the side of the Orcs?! 
---
Then later (this might have been in the Orc campaign actually), a damn Alterac dagger is found in the body of a human as the Orcs are saccing city after city, and they're hunting for the book of Medivh. These damn weak minded cowards. 
---
And hardly anyone seems to really remember or care about these events anymore!
---
Anyway man, loved the video, loved the illustrations. I enjoyed the presentation style towards the beginning, but as we're building up towards the climax the modern slang lost a bit of its charm, but was still decent, but that'd be my one criticism of it. 
---
I hope you do more of these! I think there's a bit of an untapped market for them since I think the only other dude who makes Lore videos is that European dude who's super knowledgeable and all, but the accent can be a tiny bit annoying if one isn't used to it. (Which, yes, shame on me and my uncultured ears I guess.) 
---
Also, I only just noticed that the Syndicate face coverings are Orange. That's badass. Orange is the colour of Alterac in much the same way that green is the colour of Kul Tiras or purple is the colour of Dalaran.
---
Ah good ol c'thun.. where 1 person standing 1 meter too close to someone else would wipe the raid.
---
Totally no skill involved!

You already did the math, it's in the cell directly above it. This is Excel not mailing accounting sheets.
---
Nah I want dat Malicious Axe with +30 stam
---
That's great, it's just not news that's all. :p I do love how people downvote facts though, this subreddit is great for that. It's almost like the people here who are the most excited for all the classic news haven't even watched the BlizzCon announcement where they've told us info about 1 faction per pvp realm before.
---
I DM'd you.
---
So if Spec A is built around fast 1 handers I should arbitrarily have that spec use a 2 hander and skew the results?
---
You can respec. If the row above does better, use that spec until another one does better. It's not rocket surgery.
---
Not sure why but first time in a while I‚Äôve generated decibels from my talk hole, topkek
---
Oh, I've actually seen that video.
---
Let me put it to you this way: if hps is the metric for "best healer" in this case, why does every raid want 8 resto shamans despite their lower hps?
---
Not my video but I'm sure the creator would appreciate your feedback if you want to paste that into a youtube comment.

It'd almost be more expensive to drive to a computer hardware outlet than it would be to upgrade their equipment at that speed.
---
Come on man a simple Google would've told you this isn't the case. Look at the warcraft forums! There is another comment next to this one that explains it (the databases weren't there at the time, achivs was added end of wrath)
---
I've been in a lengthy ticket correspondence with blizzard and they even said it was legit, but that they couldn't add any achivs "after" because it had to be fair for everyone.
---
I have the tier 13 items, I have the mount etc etc all dated 2006 and they could see the date I got the items.
---
I have the brew fast mount, but I don't have a single one of the other achivs you basically "have to get" to get the mount. I have trinkets from the brewfest still in my inventory lol, yet none of the achivs that are still obtainable to this date in that category (brews drinked etc etc)
---
We had aq40, naxx, bwl.. Well you name it on farm. Yet somehow I didn't have the achievement for the last boss in aq20. Turns out I didn't loot the necklace quest item back then, after all only one person out of 20 could get it and I already had a better neck on my main at the time we were doing aq20s only now and then to gear alts or if we were bored.
---
Raided 5 to 7 days a week + the mandatory flask/potions and felwood farm. Helped blizzard basically beta test the endgame content fighting world &amp; EU firsts, had chats with game-masters ingame while doing the content explaining what wasn't working properly etc..
---
List goes on.. It was another time and even now with vanilla returning in the classic servers it won't be the same. 1.12 won't have most of these problems.
---
Cheers. //a random huntard from a lost time line.
---
The unofficial Aussie server back in the day
---
Thx
---
About 100.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you, thanks for the reply though!
---
Will do!
---
If everything was done manually I would probably agree. However if you have the ability to weight the gear from 50-60 then as far as a database query goes, the only difference would be changing the value from 50-60 to whatever range you wanted.  The difference in time it would take to build the app form 50-60 vs whichever range the person would want would be negligible.
---
Eh, even PS2/xbox had plenty of rehashed shit that was the same thing over and over.  Granted, a lot of that was in the sports realm (football, racing of various types, etc), but the 'release a new game every year with minimal changes' thing was huge back then.
---
It's almost like you guys haven't actually watched/read about the classic announcement from BlizzCon. 1 faction per realm on pvp servers was confirmed back then.
---
Breaking Me Down - Soil right?
---
If you farm fire elementals, that will be the way to go early on for gold making. They will be farmed heavily though. 
---
Elementals earth farming is more likely. That‚Äôs what I farmed for my lvl 40 mount but obviously less profitable. 
---
If you can get a group together to farm devilsaur leather then that would be a great income. 
---
Not sure of any Nova spam farms, DM lasher farming was great because they‚Äôre instance mobs dropping better loot. On my last private server, I hit 60 just as DM was released so I just jumped straight into farming there. But it‚Äôs not the most efficient farming method, just the easiest.
---
Jumping in stormwind moats resets guards most of the time, unless you are too close to docks then they might be able to chase you. I am a druid and I enjoy killing auctioneers and making a break for moats and using aquatic form to escape and re-stealth. Much fun.
---
Way back in the start of vanilla their servers were so over saturated they actually had peer to peer going on. Not only that, but they limited your download to your upload, so you'd start the download at some stupid slow speed until you actually got something that's worth uploading. After that you'd piddle around on what your upload speed was which for most people was basically nothing.
---
I remember routinely starting my update before I left for school and coming back to see 60% completed. At least by that point I had gotten by the one-hour hump of 5% so it'd be finished in a couple of hours after that.
---
At least 2
---
No I just hate my family
---
&gt; restrictions are the most liberating thing of all.
---
Having to work around restrictions and limitations often leads to some of the best art ever created. Conversely, facing no such problem around which to work seems almost invariably to lead to... rather less impressive results.
---
Look at Star Wars. Lucas wasn't exactly working on a shoestring budget for the original trilogy, especially after the first film blew up, but there's no question he had a lot more resources available when making the prequels. Don't even get me started on the Disney sequels.
---
Similarly, compare The Lord of the Rings to The Hobbit. Jackson was on a pretty tight schedule for the LotR films and had a more or less set budget. In the Hobbit all that went out the window, and it showed in the final product.
---
I notice it in gaming too. Attitudes toward AAA are mixed at best these days, with seemingly more every year deciding it's simply not worth the bother. The only AAA title I've sunk any real time into in the past few years is Anthem, and that only because I play with my brother and our friend.
---
Conversely, indie gaming is positively booming. Mount&amp;Blade, Starsector, Stardew Valley, Factorio; these games own my soul.
---
Now if only we could figure out how to revive the middle market that originally created all the big franchises AAA studios are currently running into the ground.
---
There is no way to get better without putting time in.  40 is still less than halfway, 30 would be better, and 20 better than 30 etc to decide if you want to re roll.  The point I‚Äôm trying to make is you should be thinking in a general way.  Managing CDs(defensive, offensive, CCs), binding spells effectively (instant casts, cast, and placement spells), trinkets, engineering,  macros, UI, Add ons, Potions, bandages all independent of class.  Imo this is where you should start.  
---
Also when I say random I just mean to just pick something to start experiencing the game.  Obviously if you‚Äôre leaning towards something then obviously try that, but a good player can pick up any class because they know how to play the game effectively, not just a class.  A specific class‚Äô rotation, itemization and specs have all been min/maxed to death.
---
You should be able to use SM/Ruin for both 5 mans and raids. It'll actually be a lot stronger in 5 mans where the debuff cap isn't a thing and you can get 3+ corruptions ticking at the same time for free Nightfall procs.
---
Thanks for the reply! After reading through what people have said here, I am definitely going to try group leveling. We aren‚Äôt necessarily rushing to 60, so the pros seem to be outweighing the cons for me.
---
I‚Äôm going to be rolling holy paladin (dwarf master race), so pulling big groups with one or two other people should be pretty smooth then.
---
According to the movie studios, the first weekend in May is now the time for ‚Äúsummer blockbusters‚Äù. That means we should all expect next week as the release date, right?
---
That makes at least 5 now
---
I‚Äôm
---
Hoping for July since I am an 11 month employee so I have the first half of July off. With my luck it‚Äôll come out the Monday I go back to work, around the 15th I think this year.
---
For raiding, you won't have to worry about pet positioning, so you're good there. In fact, in PvE in general, microing your pet is much less impactful than PvP. 
---
If your goal is to PvP, you can run around with a Voidwalker and never really micro it (it barely needs any) and you'll be ok. You won't be as valuable to a team and you're capping your potential, but Voidwalker is still a good pet in most situations. If you want to be good, then yea, you're going to want to learn to micro your Felhunter. The extent of the micro isn't extreme, you gotta bind 2 of its abilities and then attack, follow, stay. And from then on, it's just practicing keeping track of your character and your pet. Micro is translatable between games, but it needs practice.
---
I thought this was a given... After reading this I discovered that's not how it works in the normal game. (And there are no PvP servers in the normal game?!)
---
One faction per server has always been a WoW staple for me. I can't believe they ever moved away from that.
---
Main resto druid but either warlock or hunter for farming .
---
I never watched a lot of wrestling but that was an A+ analogy. perfectly said.
---
I wasn't asked and provided no details on characters or servers, just my email.
---
Yeah that makes sense when you can do things like respeccing.
---
Here you're giving us the information that leveling from 1-10 with a one-hander is indeed slower than leveling with a two-hander.
---
Part of publishing information is choosing what is worth talking about, and this is just silly.
---
Undead Rogue main, Troll Shaman alt
---
Spirit tap
---
UD warlock semi-hardcore LFG  
---
* NA, H (hence UD), PvP realm (PvE focus)  
---
* Ideally play/raid times Wed, Thur, Fri (or Sat during morning / early afternoon) at any time between 5:30pm - 10:30pm  PST weekdays. I'm on at other random times depending on RL  
---
* ***Pertinent rules:*** I have job (and a life in general) that requires rotating on-call shifts, rendering my unavailable certain days, or late to raid / early to leave. This shift is currently 1 week each month, with a second week shared among current employees. Recently raided in BFA with a guild that was two days a week, 3.5 hours per day. I was able to attend \~80% of their raid days. Just because I am on-call, does not mean I will have a job that comes up on those days, but some days I will. Due to my lack of guaranteed raid availability, I play very seriously and hard when I am available, because i want the most out of my gaming.   
---
* During the random times I am available to play, I intend to farm mats to contribute to guild ban,k beyond my personal needs. If I cant guarantee schedule, I can guarantee contribution to guild when I am playing. This includes help with dungeon runs and other unlocks.   
---
* I have two friends that intend on joining me (likely a shaman and priest, though priest could be swayed to tank or rogue), that are top parse on their server for their current classes in BFA. They are some of the best players I have met with any class they choose, as they know it like back of their hand. Makes sense since they've been playing since vanilla. Additionally they have nearly 100% raid attendance in a semi-hardcore mythic guild.   
---
* As well, I have previous raid experience through 4 horsemen from a NE druid in vanilla, that was in two of the top three alliance guilds on Kel'Thuzad. I know the game, and study my class and boss mechanics thoroughly in my spare time to optimize.  I make mistakes as anyone does, however, I learn fast. I played through part of Legion and BFA without any add-ons, doing full clear heroic raiding, m10+, and mythic fights for what was attempted; not the top performer, though consistently in the higher numbers, and most importantly while staying alive.    
---
Ultimately, I consider myself a 1st string bench that is serious when i'm available.   
---
If interested or want to talk more, please discord @ spoonman#1730 or PM here.
---
that's no different than how it is now on retail, most of our PUG instances get put on the NA servers. Thankfully, unlike basically every other MMO WoW's NA ping for us is like 180-200, and not 300+ (lookin at you ESO)
---
Omg that‚Äôs Bear I know him
---
&gt; our new CoD title
---
Is it bad that I read that as "Cash on Delivery"?
---
bro.. Ill have a set for town so i can be pretty... hahah gunna restart my old guild named &lt;is Fabulous&gt; also for shits and giggles.
---
&gt; Part of publishing information is choosing what is worth talking about, and this is just silly.
---
Part of publishing information is keeping data consistent. If I put the best spec's performance at every level there'd only be one row, and nothing to compare against anything else.
---
If the aussies have to wait for local servers, so should the EU. It's only fair.
---
What's that watch doing there?!
---
5/5 Spirit Tap + Wand spec is a must for priest leveling.
---
So day 1 of YouTube ALL class guides, rotation, stat priority, raid guide videos instantly appeared? Just because it *existed* doesnt mean it was used
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
---
Why? They're actively trying to recreate the game as authentically as possible. They haven't changed anything else, in fact they've gone out of their way to re-implement things like spell batching. Why would they change the realm populations, one of the core design decisions of the game?
---
Australia
---
Best guild I ever joined was in Everquest. 2 months before they came out with a classic progression server they were recruiting.
---
Never connected with players like that and I've faithfully played both EQ and WoW since 1999.
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
Can always find another guild
---
just find one looking for a server which is the same as you (PVP/PVE, location and Raiding times if your interested)
---
Hmm was leaning more towards lock until I read this. The pet management and Keybinds seems like a pain to manage. Not sure I‚Äôm good enough to deal with that in a PvP setting haha. I will likely PvP more than I raid since it‚Äôs not as scheduled.
---
I think you're misreading that.
---
Their most important release (CoD) will release the second half of the year.
---
Also, Blizzard will be releasing Classic.
---
The two statements aren't linked together.
---
There was a market for vanilla  accounts.
---
Fury warrior or enhancement shaman?
---
Worse yet is that you'll gimp your gold making for raids you might never actually get to see. It makes sense if you're poopsocking it and playing 12 hours a day going for realm first, but anything besides that is dumb.
---
Male Gnome Warlock! Finally decided after changing my mind 200 times.
---
It was fairly prevalent in vanilla but that was because people sold accounts back then, so it's probably not going to happen much this time around.
---
Its from audio and pretty clear they were related, this came after discussing Q2 results.  I‚Äôd love to be wrong
---
There were people 8 months ago who actually thought they would rebalance talent trees and classes....
---
Omg the sick pet face!
---
Cry baby cry
---
Tauren druids. Two of them. Feral female, (B)OOMkin male.
---
Tauren and orc hunters. Female survival and male BM, respectively.
---
Tauren warrior.
---
Tauren shaman. Male. Elemental.
---
Troll rogue. Male. Probably.
---
Forsaken priest. Male. Tailor/enchanter.
---
Troll/Forsaken mage. Haven't decided which yet. Arcane.
---
Dwarf paladin. Female. Old lady face with the double braids. Best. Casting animations. *Ever.*
---
Gnome/human warlock. Haven't decided which yet. Female. Leaning toward gnome because adorable pink pigtails bending fell demons to her will is deliciously absurd.
---
Is anyone else looking forward to what literally everyone else on this sub is looking forward to? I should make a text post about it.
---
False. Best casting animations is the dwarf female with the braid(s). Human female is pretty good too, though.
---
But the level range of 1-10 isn't a spec. It's the choice of the worse weapon.
---
Did you actually put in weapon dps values or did you just do some SoR damage scaling of 1H vs 2H?
---
don't hide your racism. embrace it. you scared little man.
---
Yup, and how many of them were bugged as shit or overtuned and only killed after nerfs/fixes.
---
I echo this sentiment.
---
yeh and dont compare to back then, can get quick clear times these days.  even if pserver values are off it wont be enough to make much of a difference when people are clearing mc in 30 mins.  compared to multiple nights a week of wiping in the past.  you'll have time to play properly
---
Also no loot boxes or micro transactions - people don't like to hear that but those are the big money makers for every one of those games you mentioned - and even modern WoW.
---
*ridiculously gorgeous
---
I'm a veteran from Wrath and I like to think I know both classes but your thoughts have been super helpful, not helpful enough to get me to decide but nothing will till I play both classes in classic :P
---
I love both classes but 1 has to get to 60 first, does portal selling factor into money making in vanilla? And is mage easy to level, as easy as warlock? I assume the pet makes it easier
---
So much to consider
---
100% of WoW Classic players will play WoW Classic.
---
Depends what you mean by play. Try it out in the first month? Be still playing after 3 months? Be still playing after 12 months? Regularly raiding/pvp'ing at lvl 60?
---
Beautiful. All it's missing is the ornery old lady face and double braids hair.
---
&gt;they updated it to say that customer service will not move items around even after the 2hr time window is up
---
This was also what the original post said, so not an update just a clarification.
---
Warlock over mage for pvp from what I hear man, lock has sustain and mage gets no heals, more stuff to manage is a good thing, gives you more options and a higher skill ceiling :)
---
Dude people still buy new pokemon games and that's even older. Series and brands are powerful. Do you eat at a the same chain accross the country? Buy the same brand of clothes? Maybe a fan of the MCU now on like their 20 something movie in the series? 
---
It's really not that mind blowing that people stick with brands or titles they know and like.
---
july 16th
---
Gotta' respect the classics.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought and I wanted to hear where people will be chilling and what gear they will be rocking! You didn‚Äôt seem to answer it, where is your favourite spot?
---
You should do a mixture of both.  
---
Find a guild now, upon launch decide if they're rolling on a server you agree with. If they're not, bail and find a new guild who is rolling on a server you're interested in or find the server then the guild.  
---
I've already joined a guild, but if they somehow roll a server I disagree with, I'll just do what I said above. I think anyone running a guild ahead of launch is aware of this and can't necessarily be mad at it.  
---
At the end of the day, the one defining choice for all of us on launch will be the server we roll on.
---
&gt; Warlocks take the cake here because their pve spec works incredibly well in pvp.
---
SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin are the PvE specs and they are both pretty bad in PvP.
---
PvP specs would be NFC, Heavy Destro, or SL Tri-spec. Even heavy aff is better than SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin in PvP.
---
quit being a try hard. MS doesn't deserve a spot in a 40 man raid with 16 debuff slots.
---
I live in a poor podunk town in the United States. I went through an entire software engineering program, graduated with a pretty high GPA, and now have one of my professors as my closest friend. Despite all of that, it wasn't until nearly a year after graduation that I figured out 800 KB/s was snail speeds.
---
Sent you a message on discord, Zovvi#1035
---
Am I the only one hoping for a release after summer?
---
I for my part certainly won't give up my summer time for any game. I am really looking forward to classic though and will definitely sink time into it once fall/winter hits.
---
Have you looked at the spreadsheet?
---
Yes i have weapon DPS, weapon speed, SoR scaling based on weapon type and speed, SP scaling, etc.
---
&gt;But the level range of 1-10 isn't a spec. It's the choice of the worse weapon.
---
But If spec A uses 1 handers, I'm keeping things consistent in weapon type.
---
Sure in reality it doesn't really make a difference, nothing prior to level 20 really does... but it's my spreadsheet and you're complaining that my math is off by a three and a half minute difference for a 113-121 hour spread, or literally 0.048% 
---
If you want that 1/2064 bit more accuracy, feel free to make a copy of the sheet and modify it to your own needs.
---
I feel your pain. 800 KB/s here, though it was 180 at best just three or four years ago.
---
Your videos have made the wait a bit easier for a lot of us, Frost. Relaxing and informative content!
---
Personally I'd rather join a guild through people I meet in game, instead of just joining a random discord full of people I don't know.
---
If you're at all min/max-y you may want to go orc. They have pretty solid racials for hunter, especially BM spec.
---
Alternatively, if you enjoy being contrarian like me, go tauren. You probably won't be the only one around, especially right after launch, but I can virtually guarantee orcs and trolls will outnumber you 3:1, minimum.
---
Bonus: Glorious Bovine Master Race.
---
Feel pretty bummed out about that. It means the end of Linux support, and the game loses a lot of its surrounding infrastructure.
---
New models are dog shit.
---
We‚Äôre so information starved lol my comment wasn‚Äôt pointed at you but how these sorts of threads are what we do to occupy ourselves. I‚Äôll be chilling on the rooftops in Org stealthed waiting to pick off a few unlucky lowbies üòé
---
So our 'ideal leveling pace' should be literally the standing world record speed run?
---
Cool.
---
WoW always looked like a cartoon...?
---
Pffft, addons that let you equip rp sets at the press of a button were my jam, I had a great casual mix of cloth and leather on my rogue. And then there was pvping in a lovely purple dress. 
---
I'll always look good. Except for when I'm in combat.
---
(I mean I love transmog, but I'll adapt)
---
It triggers me to see hunters with cht and rouges with fang lol
---
It's so easy to understand him that I'm quite sure you are trolling
---
My man. Keep a tally of how many raid bosses you manage to kill with Starshards.
---
Windows XP always puts me back into nostalgia mode.
---
A lot of people will still look the same as each other. Each class still aims for the same gear with few exceptions. The big difference is that you'll be able to tell what gear someone has by just looking at them.
---
Enhancement isn't really a thing (outside of levelling and pvp memeing).
---
If the secondary stats are not stored optimally for search, I'd suggest transforming the data into more appropriate schema and do lookups on that schema üôÇ
---
Bruh, Outfitter and "in town" outfit for the win. If I'm in Ironforge, I'm in my Pally T2.
---
And if I'm raiding I'm also in my Pally T2, that shit's the best.
---

good point, its going to be a problem if the gm decides to roll on a server that i didnt had plans to roll on it

OP claimed that there was no information, only "printed guides" available for raids in Vanilla.  That's is manifestly untrue, and your strawman argument is taking the goal posts off the field, building a new field and putting those goalposts on that field; I did not claim that "day 1" ALL class guides, etc, instantly appeared.  I merely refuted the contention that:
---
\&gt; "No Youtube, only printed guides and information moved much slower then."
---
I refuted this contention with the following facts which you have failed to address:
---
1. Only 1 raid existed prior to Youtube.
---
2. It wasn't beaten until March, when Youtube was released.
---
3. BWL, the next raid had plenty of Youtube guides.
---
4. One of the biggest, earliest, most popular wow videos, Leeroy Jenkins, debuted on Youtube only 2 months after Youtube came into existence, giving the WoW community plenty of exposure to Youtube and Youtube videos.
---
So here are some more.
---
Before Youtube existed, you could still put videos up on websites (and other things, like GUIDES!).  And people DID!.
---
Prior to Youtube there were all sorts of websites dedicated to WoW, and yes, pretty much within the first week or two of vanilla there were deeply incomplete class leveling guides available, and within a couple months there were full guides, analysis of rotations and ideal stat priorities.
---
Molten Core wasn't beaten until March, largely because it took a long time to level to 60 back then, but as soon as MC was being beaten regularly there were walkthroughs and videos available on WoW/MMO websites.  Youtube had just launched and was an ideal platform for such videos, though for MC, most of them initially appeared on MMO oriented sites.  Youtube exploded pretty quickly so it didn't take long for it to take over, well within the first year of release.
---
As for BWL, there were guides up on Youtube and other video streaming sites, and on MMO websites, within days of it being beaten.
---
Hey, you gotta' have cake.

Actually sitting down and thinking about each of the characters I intend to play, I was surprised to realize I have a ~50/50 split. It's usually more 80/20.
---
Maybe I'm going soft in my old age (I'm 33, so no).
---
In your analogy I would put mobile games as Roman Reigns.  We don't want it but it keeps getting pushed down our throats.
---
Honestly, im looking forward to that.  Ive been getting more and more casual since the end of MoP.  Some of that is work taking up too much of my time, but a lot of it is simply that i dont enjoy the insane perfection that high end raiding requires.  
---
Im fine with putting in work to get boss kills, but retail just isnt the kind of work i enjoy.
---
I'll help!
---
...by doing exactly the opposite and encouraging your altoholism until it's raging out of control just like my own.

I downvoted, but I still respect the troll.

Let's see all the Redditors rushing to make a comment complaining about the comments complaining about the Youtubers rushing to make a 10 minute video about this.

It's also the highest maintenance and skill required dps spec from a healing class.
---
I wouldn't suggest it to someone unless they are highly committed.
---
You can do whatever you want dude, I'm not going to say stop doing what makes you happy.
---
I'm trying to say that the information you present has some nonsensical stuff in it and since you seem to enjoy presenting it I'm trying to convince you on some good pointers here to help you and your readers.

---
One faction per realm PvP realms
---
As many things as they may get wrong, admittedly a lot of it is spot on
---
In about one year classic wow will suck up 60-70% of the pop from retail. Especially if blizzard fucks up patch 8.2 and 8.3. 
---
Above happened to runescape 3. Old school runescape is far more popular. See: http://www.misplaceditems.com/rs_tools/graph/
---
A spec a lot of people go with that I dont really like. The problem is youre wasting a lot of potential in both trees for PvP. With Conviction and Vengeance, youre pretty much committed to a more offensive hybrid build, so youre sort of forcing yourself into a more SoC build, but you dont commit far enough to it to get Repentence and get compensated with a much worse PvP CD with Divine Favor.
---
If youre going to bother with 30 points in ret, you may as well go 31, Divine Favor is a seriously overrated ability in PvE and is marginal at best in PvP without Holy Shock. Repentence really makes the Holy/Ret Hybrid spec, it gives you the 6 sec healing window, Incap to save someone elses life from range, extra burst from Judgement of Command, spell/heal Interrupt, catchup mechanism, its just such enormous utility in PvP that MAKES the Holy/Ret Hybrid. SoC'/Conviction/Vengeance arent all that much better than Imp SoR with some good Hybrid gear, the main reason youre getting these abilities with this hybrid spec is to push towards Repentence. SoC/Conviction/Vengeance is only really good when you go all out into melee stats, but then youre not really playing the Hybrid game anymore.
---
For raid healing, Holy Power is really helpful early on when your gear isnt as good, but becomes less necessary as you get more Mp5 and Crit gear. Holy Shock is really terrible in raids.
---
So my recommendation is either 25/26/0 if youre more the defensive holy type that likes sitting back and healing, but being able to beat back melee on your own, or 20/0/31 if you want to go from healing to fighting and back and forth to whatevers needed.
---
As a last note, I dont get these people that put 1 point in Imp LoH. Its 2 or 0. You get Imp LoH for the armor buff for certain harder fights, if you dont get both points, youre just gimping the armor buff or your scumbagging that extra point and claiming you have Imp LoH and hoping they dont notice its only 1 point.

---
I still consider PVP guides to be the great untouched content for WoW video making.  
---
People like myself who haven't really had the time or have primarily focused on PVE so we don't have as much PVP exposure would eat up every video that was offering explanations at an introductory level. "Rogue vs Mage 101", "Rogue vs Druid 101", "Warlock vs Shaman 101" etc  
---
The amount of duplicate videos we get on the same topic is astronomical, yet PVP guides are an unmined vein of gold.
---
The fact that your old PC was either a potato, and/or hadn't been opened, cleaned, reconfigured and set up properly in years, doesn't mean all PCs were that way 14 years ago.
---
Yeah, there are tonnes of quests with +SP. prob don‚Äôt get a lot of +healing till later though. 
---
5 mans at this stage are pretty easy. Remember tanks don‚Äôt have plate at this stage so even shammy‚Äôs can tank (even a hunter played well can use his pet to tank). Healers can heal in DPS spec etc.  There are plenty of good drops with +SP in lower dungeons.
---
don't you mean "shirts and giggles"? :D

Gotta' work with a flight stick, though. Even better if it actually comes with one modeled to look like either an X-wing or TIE fighter stick (my vote's for the latter).

I'm looking forward to seeing threads, about what threads, about what people look forward to, people agree on. Maybe I should open a thread about that...?
---
Personally I think PvP, specifically in BG's is a great place to learn or at least get some practice healing. If you stuff up (which you will, no big deal) everyone just respawns and gets on with their day. Whereas if you're PvE'ing and you stuff up, then you're setting the whole group back - restarting boss fights etc. 
---
Having PvP'ed a lot myself, it would be a huge relief just to see someone even just trying to heal - I can't count how many BG's I've gone through with absolutely no healers.

If you leveling together, you‚Äôll be able to complete every elite quest together. None really require more than 2 till you hit instance quests. 
---
If you are power leveling together, then finding good grinding spots is great for xp. Caves full or mobs and just chain pull on the warrior as the priest heals. You can also run instances easily for fast xp.

Check out Joana‚Äôs guide. While it might not be the most optimal route for a duo, it should still be pretty good. It also lists group quests worth doing, and what minimum number of players in the party you‚Äôll need to do them efficiently.
---
EDIT: Ah just noticed you‚Äôre Alliance. Joana‚Äôs Alliance guide isn‚Äôt out yet. Still worth a look during beta/launch.
---
I totally understand the sentiment but I do state that it is a great way to gauge whether or not you are leveling quickly or falling behind. The point of the video is to see the most ideal leveling time you can aim for, some may go faster and some may go slower. A large portion of the 1-30 leveling 'ideal' times are based off of personal experience/leveling times.  
---
Many players have smoothed out Joana's routes and do it more efficiently. For instance, it took Joana 52 minutes to get through the Valley of Trials where as it is possible to finish the Valley of Trials in 30 minutes if you are being extremely efficient.\*Appreciate the feedback nonetheless, I can see how my sentiment may be slightly overzealous.
---
Clocked in 218 hours on my solo campaign at release and now I'm playing it again with a friend. One of the best RPGs of all time in my humble opinion.
---
Been struggling with this question as well... Applying now would let you to pick a guild of your liking and confirm a class / spot. Also it would be nice to already have a community while leveling. On the other hand, there's no word of servers yet, no idea where the streamers are gonna play (which servers to avoid), and no idea how my work schedules will be like after summer. Might just wait till the launch month and try to look for guilds then..
---
What do you mean by "already spent"?
---
We had several hunters quit because they didn't feel as useful.  Dps warriors, mages, and especially locks caught up and surpassed them.  I know once I got the t2 8 piece none of the hunters could even get remotely close.
---
CoD is every year. They might've not announced it yet, but CoD as a yearly franchise is probably something you could set an atomic clock to. I know people bitch that it doesn't change that much, but it surprisingly does - it's just that the changes are stuff nobody actually likes.
---
It really doesn't matter. Comparing the average player to a speed runner is like asking my nephew to pick up the pace because the Olympic runners on the track are lapping him. In that scenario there is still no way for my nephew to really tell how he's improving by watching the Olympic runners fly by him at 20 mph.
---
I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt join a guild now, if it suits your playing style and what you are looking for, and is folk in the same situation as yourself.
---
I‚Äôve not played since 2012 and have joined one, and they all see a good bunch of folk from all over Europe. 
---
I believe this will help me level, help me with some professions I need help with or even help me do any group quests as I‚Äôm leveling. 
---
If for whatever reason it doesn‚Äôt work out once the game is launched then it‚Äôs no issue.
---
Also, all the chat on discord now, means you get to know folk prior to launch.
---
I'd pay good money for solid campaigns again, like Big Red 1 or the first two MW, but they no longer even offer *a* campaign

As in they are doing the first 5 already in wand spec

Rogue has one of the highest skill capped PvE rotations in the game with everything tying into energy pooling and swing timers.
---
Wholeheartedly agree with you. Subnautica and Divinity Original Sin 2 are very immersive and fun games. I'm looking forward to a new Divinity and Subnautica: Below Zero, whenever it's ready for release.

---
It's pretty wild how much gaming has changed since I was a kid. It's just hot garbage.
---
Is there really one weight for each stat for each class?
---
Imo it depends on your stats right now and thus on the gear you are wearing.
---
I.e. if I got +healing on all of my items and spirit on none of em, +healing has to have a lower weight than spirit.

Success does not mean game is AAA-title. Kingdom Come was developed by pretty average sized Czech studio and this was their first game (and then studio was sold). It's pretty much on middle ground but I wouldn't say it to be AAA game.

Largely a pointless rule if you can right click add B-net friend for opposite faction, hopefully this won't be possible.
---
*Laughs from Sweden*
---
Is he just theorycrafting?

I honestly wish the faction rule was just across all realms. Its a small thing, but it really does add weight to your faction choice.
---
We had the same thing in DAOC for relic raids!
---
As long as it's a 2-3 man quest you should be ok.
---
Though some of the more tightly packed ones, like the Dark Irons at Thandol or killing Gath'il'zog at redridge can be pretty annoying and can get messy without CC. Pull carefully.
---
Aside for that you should be fine. The really really hard stuff tends to be more end-game oriented, so you'll likely be able to get groups for those.
---
I pretty much never read the quest text in retail (or I didn't; haven't played since Legion). There wasn't any point.
---
Yeah, but I don't know anyone who looks at June 21st and says "oh its summer now". People don't really consider dates, but rather seasons/weather/etc, so for summer its basically just "oh its hot a lot now, so its summer".
---
If it were still snowing and 10 degrees outside, I don't care if its May. Its winter.
---
Unless they intentionally go out of their way to disable this, it should be possible. Theunderminejournal was running on the 7.0 client they are using for classic.
---
No.
---
All of you people are speculating about population changes, but they already answered this question.
---
They have explicitly stated they don't want to start modifying the WoW 1.12 data.
---
Changing population numbers will change the resource consumption of EVERY resource on the server, which means a MAJOR change from vanilla in the markets.
---
They CANNOT keep the vanilla experience if they change the population limits, without also increasing resource availability... ie modifying spawn rates of everything from herbs, up to and including black lotus, mobs, for loot up to and including devilsaur leather, and minerals from copper to Rich Thorium. 
---
Which they have stated they are unwilling to do.
---
Cool!  I always heard ‚Äújust keep a set of (x) gear‚Äù.  The viability of this has been scratching at my head for awhile.
---
(My closest experience to classic is Pservers and leveling at the end of TBC through the classic zones.  And I almost exclusively played melee.)
---
Exactly.
---
They CANNOT keep the vanilla experience if they change the population limits, without also increasing resource availability... ie modifying spawn rates of everything from herbs, up to and including black lotus, mobs, for loot up to and including devilsaur leather, and minerals from copper to Rich Thorium.
---
To clearify as well, people who wasn't invited to the raid but showed up on time had prio on the next raid. Everyone was wery happy with this system.
---
Along with hidden bid DKP (you made 1 bid on an item to the raidleader, highest bidder got it for 2nd highest bid +15 DKP. If only you bid, items had a set price).
---
Don't remember anyone being mad about anything when it came to raiding, DKP etc.
---
To be fair, WoW has always looked cartoony; its literally the first thing people criticize WoW when you suggest that its good or maybe they'd like it.
---
Hell yeah ;)
---
They have something like 265million players monthly. They dwarf numbers from Activision (41) and Blizzard (32). They have around 30min avg daily play.
---
I don't doubt that. I'm just saying, it will be interesting to see how things play out with true Vanilla numbers + the skill and knowledge we have now. We've never had that combination before. 
---
What class were you? I've been thinking about rolling hunter this go around, but I'm not sure yet.

---
It was just something that was a money sink in the game! If you do it a lot it rises to 50g a time. 
---
It never bothered me on my hunter, as by the time you are 60 and have 1 day for farming, I had plenty of gold. I‚Äôd spend 3-4hrs a week farming, either DM runs or other lower level instances and selling the mats, and this more than covered my respec (about 4 a week), to allow me to raid twice and PvP in between.
---
Funny people think WotF completely gimps alliance warlocks, yet no one decides not to play human rogue because of orc stun racial.
---
Getting Rok'Delar is fairly easy for Hunter. Should be a 50% droprate for the quest item. Can easily use that up until Naxx. Hopefully you can get the BWL crossbow within the 18 months before that comes out.
---
No not at all. I had a hunter main, which I raided on twice a week, but ended up leveling a shammy for pvping.
---
Im rolling my eyes so hard at this nonsense.  You were immersed in that dogshit model though?  Just admit its nostalgia.

At the time I had a max speed of 150KB/s... Now it's 12MB/S

New models and animations look like a totally different game. Cant believe this is even a discussion point

They just put out a statement that model edits are not allowed after banning everyone using them for 6months plus and then reverting the ban the next day on retail.

Classic will be running on the new 1.13 version. It's basically 1.12 but they just called it 1.13 because of the engine changes.

Yeah, it's just my personally preference. I wouldn't say its nostalgia. It just looks a lot better to me.
---
Do be advised however, that some consider it to be unnatural.

There‚Äôs a lot of secrecy in the vanilla pvp community. The pro‚Äôs really don‚Äôt like sharing all their tricks. They love having the upper hand against inexperienced players so they can put them in their movies.
---
Maybe he is in the friends and family beta?
---
Either theoretically or he‚Äôs leveling on a Pserver.
---
I gotta be honest... for the first few days I dont think I'd even be mad.
---
Second half of the year basically changes nothing as it starts in very early summer.
---
So the soonest release date would be July 1st.
---
my Ideal time is, I am just going to enjoy the game and not race through it like a freak
---
the only catch is that you MUST get the killing blow for it activate. So try to work with your friend  to arrange that.
---
By bet is still on July 16th as the prophecy dictates.
---
The people who say that are the one's who Peaked in Molten core and BWL
---
They never managed to get past the introductory raids, so they have no clue.
---
A few of them might have tried them on Private servers, where world buffs are always available and give everyone a free two Tiers of gear worth of stats.
---
I don't know, comparing it to other MMOS like GW2 and FF14 it looks a looot better to me.
---
Basically these 2 will take you to 60 if you keep your wand upgraded.
---
It‚Äôs mainly the pvp items and you listed most of them. Linken‚Äôs Boomerang is another big one. And of course Light of Elune. 
---
Some of these are tough to get while you‚Äôre still leveling. You can always go back for them at 60 so don‚Äôt stress too much over it.
---
You should join my guild as we are openly recruiting all players :D
---
We got a private server vet core and will be raiding hard
---
Hmm I think you have possibly swayed me to pick up shammy or druid. I like the ele/NS build for shammy and think it would be fun to play. And also the HotW/NS seems sick too. For both of these specs they can raid heal without changing spec? I don't want to get broke from changing specs all the time.
---
only did zg back in vanilla. Still one of the best times doing my first ever raid with 25 other people and communicating, felt like an mmorpg.
---
I think it's all cyclical. We're already seeing massive fatigue in the looter-shooter genre and battle royale is already seeing a down turn. I think we'll see the return of subscription based MMOs in the next 5 years.
---
People are corrupted by private servers honestly.
---
for sure its no different, and I wouldn't want to be completely taken out of NA matchmaking specifically due to the unavoidable downtime that comes with smaller regions like ours, the matchmaker just needs to hold oce players in queue for a liiiiiiitttlleee bit longer to find other local players before going out to NA for matches.
---
Eh, I don't get the hate for transmog. I like my toon to look however I want, but I do see some benefit in not having it like a form of prestige. It was kinda nice having your ego stroked when people were impressed by simpler things like your armor, mount, titles, guild you're in. Though I guess none of that compares to rep.

Its actually June 21st until September 23rd, but even still that isn't how people actually conceptualize seasons in their day to day life. But this is a semantic argument, which is by far the worst kind of argument.
---
It‚Äôs 50g per respec. So if your guild raids twice a week you‚Äôll have to respec 4 times if you want to pvp in between raids. 200g a week is a lot of gold especially for warriors. 
---
My experience on private servers is that warriors who are ranking up never bother respecing but just raid as pvp arms. The first two raid tiers are pretty trivial so it‚Äôs really not a big deal if you‚Äôre doing suboptimal dps.
---
It is. Best overview I've found so far.

What addons are you referring to here? The later content was largely designed under the assumption people would be using addons.
---
there are some that make the game boring, like the healer addon where you click a button and it auto heals whoever needs it most with the right rank of heal (I refuse to use it because I want to play my game, not have it played for me), but... even so, it doesn't ruin the game for others
---
I got mine after a hunter..

Your experience on life servers is flawed, most ppl nowdays have a way better understanding of the game and the honor system.
---
For example the "power" of the honor system and how it works wasnt rly know until way later.
---
And it wont be normal ppl that make the problem but the small 5-1%.
---
And its not "pvp servers" its only "pvp server at the start of p2" where all hardcore ppl need to max out honor for the next 2-3month and will, if the server is big enough, have insane honor wars.
---
Its just common sense just think like someone who needs max honor/h, a 48 kill gives allmost the same honors as a 60 kill so why not go for the easy kills.
---
You will make your rounds in the most likely more populated low level zones and gank there, the ppl there cant form a resistance against you, and level 60 that come the help can be killed for a good while until there are to mutch and you switch zone, cause you have no time to die. And switching zones after a while is needed anyway, since you can kill ppl max 5 times.
---
And it takes time to have so many level 60 in a low zone that can kill a group of 5 max out geared, bags full of consumes guys that did nothing but pvp in classic for the last years.

If you do the same in a level 55-60 zone its not even needed for help to come, with one cirkel in the zone you will have big hate mob that may be able to kill you.
---
And the honor farmers cant have a fight where they can die, they will compete against others, and epic fights just dont give honor, its like fighting premades. Opponents that fight back are just not effective.
---
And for the level cap, lets make a quick calculation, i consider myself kinda hardcore with beeing able to play 5h a day i will take 60 days to hit level 60, ~10days kinda normal, i had a few chars that did take 8 but a few chars that did take more.
---
I dont think its save to say the majority will be 60, depending on how long p1 is, i assumed with 4 month. 
---
So i would say its kinda unlikely that most of the ppl are 60 then, sure most of the players like "us" will be 60, ak that are extremly hyped for the game.
---
I just want to lie on the beach and wear Bloodfang. It's all I ever wanted.
---
Blizzard went pretty far with their easter eggs teasing a July 16th release at Blizzcon.
---
I got everything except the flip flops. Crocs is a decent replacement though.
---
you can hold your own as Soul link well but if you wanna play like drakedog you need more spell damage imo.
---
Ssoooweeet
---
Love how you hid the bears identity too
---
*Not inclusive of all possible items one may wish to hold on.
---
More so those with niche uses in pvp as etc'd by op.
---
\&gt;  despite nobody essentially bothering with melee until T6 
---
A couple of our top performers back then were melee. We had a healthy mix of everything and didn't have issues clearing content, except for when it was buggy ofc. Sure, our Warlocks did the most damage overall, but our melees were no joke either.
---
There was never a point in the game where not bringing melees was even a consideration. I don't know our full comp anymore but I remember a very good fury warrior and a very good rogue as well.
---
No worries, he‚Äôs a person of public interest. It‚Äôs fine even with European law.
---
It bugs me as a PVPer, I want to be able to gauge how hard somebody is going to hit me before they hit me. This isn't an issue in BfA since gear doesn't matter in PVP, but I'd hate it in Vanilla.
---
My boss told me I had to be early if I wanted a summer vacation, so about a month ago I seriously banked on this date and took out a few days of my vacation to play it.
---
Lord, please, let it happen.
---
Your pet is now compromised... censored his face but not his name
---
F
---
That‚Äôs apples and oranges
---
#nochanges and sh*t ;)
---
Lol, as a Paladin that's so damn legit.
---
Was actually late MoP. Within a month of the 6.0 prepatch but still MoP.
---
27 Aug most likely.
---
Transforms would definitely work for this, however it wouldn't be a part of the base iteration.  Unless of course someone with the know-how would like to implement it before I can get to it. 
---
The random trinket buffs, I would definitely need someone with a good understanding of itemization to find a way to weight them in the first place though, because I don't really have a clue of how to weight them off the top of my head.
---
Pls bring it in august or july. My girlfriend is leaving for 5 months abroad for university. I need something to waste time during this time üòÖ
---
Should be mentioned that numbers might be skewed cause a lot of us are vanilla turbospergs
---
I expect a lot of normies to go rogue
---
August 27 most likely.
---
Wait.. this doesn't reconfirm summer at all. Just confirms it will be this year.
---
The idea is to allow people to enter their own stat weights, which would allow the user to account for current gear, talents, etc.  Though at the same time, I think people would appreciate being able to search for gear for cookie cutter specs, without having to dig up stat weights for those specs on their own.
---
Why the fuck are you people downvoting him?
---
The spawn rates of vanilla are not being altered, and they were made with a maximum online pop of 2500-3000 in mind.
---
If blizzard is to increase server limits they'll also have to increase spawn rates. This is something they won't do, something they said they won't do.
---
They may introduce sharding, which *noone* really want, except in the starter areas.
---
I get that more clarification is good, but you're playing stupid to not realise that any large release like this is talked about in terms of the US or at the very least, Northern Hemisphere summer dates. I live in the Southern Hemisphere we are used to seeing Summer 'XX on any big release and just thinking late June-September, because it's been that way forever.
---
Because raiding is the only part of WoW
---
I was migrating largish database last year to NoSQL, still have some tools around for it. It should not be hard to create a transform once you know how you want to apply the weights.
---
About the weight values, maybe community can chip in, you could have weight presets that people can submit and then use
---
First of all I think there won‚Äòt be that many players over a longer time. On this subreddit we are loud but in the end we are a minority when it comes to big numbers. The second point is monitoring. No expansions means no big money every year and no store with mounts, server transfers, tokens, transmog etc. So it‚Äòs a small project to show their fans that they still care. I think its more like a pr stunt and not a many making machine
---
The problem with indie games, at least for me, is that they seem to mainly be single player games. Or at least the ones everyone raves about. 
---
Video games are as much about hanging with friends as they are about the actual game for me.
---
G‚Äôday mate.. they bloody well are
---
When does Sm/Ruin start doing well?
---
idk. Quite impressive if he still goes to school and has time to sleep.
---
Nice video, too bad most ppl wont understand whats going on there and how good the rogue rly plays.
---
But hey it will be world of rogue craft again with rogues pwning everything, right guys ? right ? ;)
---
Nah, the min/max culture has always (since at least a few months after release) .
---
There were some amazing threads in the druid blizzard forum back in the day like 2005. The math was done on everything. Specs, items, combinations. Rotations. Downranking heals and macros and how HoTs worked with +healing. The community at large finding out that weap dmg didnt work in forms, what items proccs did work and so on. Lists of good gear.
---
For many, this sort of discussion is a big part of the game. Could people be kinder? Maybe, but mostly I see people just being frank.
---
Anyway, did people care? Did most people look up all the theorycrafting? I think so. More or less. It evolved. Did many still just do what they wanted to? Did your spec not being visible help? Yeah. 
---
Just play the way you want to. But some things are just ‚Äùthe safer bet‚Äù when inviting people.
---
If people ask for advise, advise will be given. But most of the time people tell others to do what they want.
---
&gt;  the gap between players with or without will be too big and you'll be forced to install them. 
---
How bout the skill gap, think we should get rid of that too? How bout people who have mechanical keyboards and multi button mice? How bout people with better hardware? How bout people with high refresh rate monitors?
---
Not rly, most "tricks" are well known today.
---
But as a casual you cant pull them off, because it takes alot of skill, or it just takes a item that you dont have.
---
Tidal charm, despell mace, engi stuff, on use items from the world etc.
---
As a normal player you just dont have these stuff and are rdy to use it.
---
I'm the scatman.
---
July 16th has not been de-confirmed. Lets go, boys.
---
There we go again.
---
We have 2 or 3 threads like that every day.
---
Addons were a part of Vanilla and were much more powerful than what we will get with the new API.
---
Competitive players will use them, Luddites won't.
---
People that have more play time will get further than people that can't play much.
---
MMOs are inherently unfair.
---
It would always be clientside only like your graphics settings.
---
Ouch painful !
---
I can see that. I like the extra layer of mystery, ganking should be risky XD It might be nice to have a toggle so you can turn it off if you want to see the real gear.
---
Dwarf priest. 
---
Our riflemen ain't the only ones who can *light* 'em up!
---
Always help your faction unless he said otherwise.
---
This is awesome, thank you so much.  I saved a copy of each continent for Classic.
---
Transmog did wonders for the RP elements of wow, you could actually look like a real person and not like a hobo who fell into a container of discarded clothes
---
Where did they say this about not increasing spawn rates?
---
You're right :(
---
&gt; "*Pantheon is a zone-based game as opposed to having a truly seamless  world, although this could change as technology and tools evolve,  either before or after launch. Regardless, however, our current  technology and tools allow us to create truly vast, rich, and detailed  zones. Players will not be running frequently into zone borders. Our  larger zones also allow us to create long vistas and views, and in  almost all cases, if you can see a location you can travel there.*
---
So what is left for them to announce? Just a few things with a couple big things right?
---
So the usual then. Threaten to ban but don't actually ban people.
---
You can‚Äôt expect me to put in all this time required to git gud, I have a job man. They should add something that puts me into a raid with 24 other players, and it will be an easier version  so o can see all the content.
---
Let‚Äôs just get organised and roll on US servers - I‚Äôm most worried that there won‚Äôt be enough aussies full stop to support both a pvp and pve server (proudmoore was the unofficial pve oceanic iirc)
---
The three Warcraft games.
---
Darkest Dungeon.
---
Diablo 1 and 2. Would play a third game in the series if one existed. Too bad it doesn't. Nope. Doesn't exist. 
---
Those are the ones that I keep going back to. There's also the 4th or so Dragon Age: Origins playthrough in there but that's a play once and leave it kind of thing. The games at the top here are things that allow me to come back week after week and still be playing the same save or whatever.
---
No thanks I don't want to become epileptic \^\^
---
I will be sitting right outside of Ironforge auction house steps and do /cry emote once in a while on my gnome to back my mount foundraiser :)
---
Duo's can do basically all of them though there are more than a few that will be tough. Someone mentioned Redridge and the Dark Iron Dwarves at Thandol Span already. The final elite in the elite quest chain in Duskwood can be hard to duo. The elite chain in Searing Gorge is tough. Hinterlands elite troll quests I'm not sure are even possible as a duo unless you out gear and level them. The last quest chain that would be hard to duo is the Scarlet Crusaders in WPL with probably the best written quest chain in Vanilla.
---
Maybe you want an automatic legendary weapon once you reach max lvl too ?
---
How about they ease the pain of levelling and you can get 60 for a few $$ ?
---
(I feel dirty now ! :o )
---
Did they say anything yet about no special characters in you name? Like √§ √¢ √° etc. I'd really prefer names to be unique.
---
are you sincerely that narrowminded? do you actually think its hard to bypass all the variables by a simple math equations?
---
get out.
---
15$/month 100/100.
---
TJENA
---
Yeah CS has improved immensely. My account was hacked during a break in TBC. After sending them basically every fucking ID I had, they let me get the account back. This alone took months. 
---
When I finally got it back, this was about in the middle of the tbc timeline, my account was blocked from using any digital form of payment. I had to use game cards solely. 
---
Contacted blizzard again, and literally no one I talked to could understand how or who placed such a restriction, promising it would be removed, only to be informed a week or two later that they wouldn‚Äôt. This happened three or four times until I just gave up. All my characters where now on a dead server, I couldn‚Äôt transfer them because I couldn‚Äôt use a digital form of payment, and I could only use game cards. They literally didn‚Äôt want my money.
---
A few months ago, I sent blizzard an email explaining it, they replied within a minute with ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs strange, but we removed all restrictions and merged it with your other bnet account, have a nice day‚Äù. 
---
Night and day
---
If you aren't wearing a rich purple silk shirt are you even playing vanilla?
---
Yes, and it will be the first time Oceania will experience classic like this. It is actually something new to look forward to!
---
Thanks for the spot, updated now
---
Found the braindead mage
---
I read that as Foreskin Shadow Priest 3 times before my brain fixed itself lol.
---
Pserver
---
TBC (except sunwell maybe) had nothing to do with gear checks, when TBC was released in china a guild got Illidan down while still having Tier 3 armor on most players.
---
Shaman, duh
---
Haha, yeah.
---
If you aren't sitting afk on the mailbox decked in full epics while Piccolo of the Flaming Fire is active *are you even playing vanilla wow*?
---
I know it's a meme that is constantly parroted by youtubers but I think people are really underestimating how many people will be active on it.  This sub is the vocal minority, so it's not like you can say everyone is going to play it because everyone on this sub is going to play it.  
---
But I think if you look at two things: 
---
1) Other games that have done this, runescape, EQ, etc. have seen quite a bit of success. 
---
2) WoW private servers show the appetite for Vanilla is there, it's the most common/popular private server "expansion" only closely rivaled by WotLK.  And really Nostalrius was huge.  
---
You're right they aren't looking at this as a money making machine clearly, but it should be relatively high profit.  They just have a few engineers working on it.  No designers/artists necessary.  
---
I guess the question is how big does it need to be to get their attention?  I think it's obvious they'll break 100k (this sub is almost there and it's somewhat obscure).  That's 1.5m per month.  
---
Would 500k subs get attention?  1m?  They're clearly planning on quite a bit of action on the leveling zones with talk of sharding.  
---
It makes me wonder how many servers they are planning and how many users they have projected, because clearly they aren't expecting a massive influx of new subs.
---
Thats a very stupid thing to say. You obviously have no idea who blizzard entertainment is, and you call everyone with a rational mind retard? Ok dude.
---
Pally T2 is only reason I would roll ally side.
---
No lol. Warlock is the class with the highest amount of abilites in the game. Even more than druid. Mage is average and much more no brainer and straightforward. You have insant spells and cc and its objetively easier
---
Honestly you seem like a lazy person. Go mage
---
Addons are the customization options the ingame client does not give. I love addons. Makes me feel like a pilot in a cockpit with a thousand buttons to press and meters to watch.
---
Everyone is free to play with the addons they want.
---
"Our most important cash grab, shooter game with loot boxes. Blizzard will also release the wow people actually want"
---
I can‚Äôt recall seeing much of it at all in trade on my server. Mainly just some rando lvl 60s trying to sell runs thru low lvl dungeons.
---
Really? I'd said it did the very opposite. Instead of role playing, you were role playing a role player. And looking like a cowboy in a raid just doesn't fit.
---
I've always thought the best solution was to just have outfits and put them on where appropriate. You'd have your raid gear, your city clothes, your pirate costume or whatever. That felt a lot more "real" than simply pretending you are wearing different armor.
---
What if I was to tell you that a lot of people, historically and contemporaneously, do in fact distinguish the seasons using the solstice / equinox.
---
You don't become epileptic because of the flashing images and cuts between scenes. These only affect you if you are already epileptic. Dark ages are long gone. Read a book.
---
Fewer mechanics in vanilla, which I like. Staring at timers for 5+ different boss abilities in retail now is just annoying. And watching timers on the million CDs we have.
---
Stop DBM use, which allows the fights to be similar difficulty while mechanically easier to develop, and cut the 4 levels of difficulties, maybe we'd get more than 2 bosses in a new raid instance release.... blizz really shoots themselves in the foot. They have complete control of the api for mods. Restrict that stuff, make your job easier, roll out content quicker. 
---
I think it was said the majority of MC was developed in a weekend or something. Imagine if they could roll out a new raid monthly instead of a couple times a year. That would also let them reduce loot drop frequency, so raids stop feeling like loot pinatas. The tier of raids, like 4x monthly releases would all have loot on the same level. So the gear could be spread over more content.
---
Do you work at blizzard? You seem really certain i  your statements. Why wouldnt we be concerned when stuff like this happens? How can anyone trust blizzard 100% after they have run almost every single gamefranchise they own into the ground. Its called being rational, you should try it.
---
Epic just purchased them...
---
I'm not sure whether to direct you to /r/iamverysmart or /r/DeadAssMemes
---
Yeah but it went from old Cartoon Network to the new Cartoon Network.
---
Yes, we're going to be level 12 ugly turds, and love it.
---
It's always nice to have a few people to play with directly, getting to know them before launch and just chillin'.
---
Me, my GF and my friends will play together at first and maybe invite more people to our guild later.
---
Well that's cause classic wow isn't garbage, oldschool runescape is.
---
Haha hello 2021 by the time that‚Äôll happen!
---
Great Idea, if you end up going through with this I would love to give it a try. Would you know if it's possible to also sort by hit chance as well? Melee hit chance in particular I suppose. Along with crit chance and the common stats like strength agi etc. That would be amazing if you could pull it off. Best of luck!
---
The game begins after you hit 60. I have leveled 860 skill levels in F2P RuneScape. It is more grindy, but WoW is a bigger time sink.
---
Read a sarcasm.
---
I am being rational, unlike 90% of the classic community that thinks blizzard is going to screw this over. They KNOW what we want and have made it clear they aren't going to skew away from that. We know access to Classic is tied to a universal wow sub fee. Since the sub fee can be paid for using in game gold on BFA through the wow token, it's OBVIOUS that it will prompt you in classic, like it does in BFA, that you can pay gold for a wow token to renew the sub. Obviously the gold would be taken out of your BFA characters inventory as well, since classic will have a much lower priced economy. 
---
I don't have to work at blizzard to use common sense and reasoning... Maybe YOU should try it sometime.
---
this 100% happened, i was the backpack
---
For the Horde.
---
And a low cost gamble too - relatively small cost of refurbishing the game means it can live as a niche product serving a core fanbase, and if it takes off again like original vanilla then all the better.
---
Wholesome, I still have this parchment burned-like letter with a Horde logo and call to arms that my friend sent me when I sorta abandoned Wow :D I mean, I could not stay put after an invite like that!
---
No I personally hate them. BETTER graphics don't necessarily make them more pleasing and that goes for more than just WoW. I still prefer Half-Life 1's design over 2, and that game has a lot worse graphics.
---
Fucking disgusting. Another new CoD title? Read the God damn market. No one wants it. How clueless can a company be?
---
Hello i am sorry to tell you that 680 skill levels is nothing.
---
In Runescape half of level 99 is level 92.
---
As the total level is approx 2200 you aren't anywhere near 2% of total completion
---
Why do you care if someone sees your char as a new model..?
---
Anybody that thinks OSRS is garbage either hasn't played it, or hasn't played it for long enough.
---
All of them
---
Count me in +1
---
Well that wouldn't really happen, if the guild discord is serious then they wouldn't be free to join or filled with people you don't want to play with. You would be recruited and well informed of the guilds ideals and goals, so that you would know what you are getting into. Go check out the Classic WoW Guilds discord, it already has almost 5000 members and tons of guilds recruiting. I have no doubt you would be able to find a guild that suits you there.
---
Though if you would prefer to let it happen randomly, and get placed with random members, then waiting to do it in-game is your best bet.
---
I will take that into consideration
---
Welcome home. :) For the Horde!
---
"WILL BLIZZARD INCLUDE WOTLK IN THEIR CLASSIC BUILD!?"
---
Far**g**odeep Mine triggered my OCD!  
---
Love the maps, they are awesome!
---
i wouldnt call it standing world record speedrun, 1-12 in 3 hours, 1-20 in 8~12 hours and 1-30 24 hours is pretty mediocre time, even joana has beaten his own record, and people are doing so much faster than him nowadays.
---
Mrrglrllrmmmrgglll intensifies
---
Just saw this massively downvoted comment. 
---
You missed the entire concept of this post bro.
---
Two monitors are the dark ages. Cool kids these days use ultrawides.
---
The question is not so much which one I'm going to pick but what order I am going to make them in.
---
Solo, generally. Questing in groups (im taking it for granted that this is for more than likr 1 quest, and that you re thinking of lvling a solid bunxh with quests) often comes with caviats like clearing an entire area for mobs, sharing greenies (im greedy), taking pauses when *they* feel like it, and having to wait when they need to skill up, do class quests, detour when they need an item from somewhere etc etc etc
---
There are certain quests where beibg in a group is beneficial though. Honestly, what you should do is just to do what you feel like, odds are that what you "feel" like will be close to optimal
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy09EIDGm0k&amp;t=109s
---
Best would probably be to just let you drift in the WoW world without any knowledge about it beforehand.
---
This would let you experience WoW in all it's glory up to 60. When your 60, you could get information how to setup your Character the best.
---
Otherwise there are plenty of videos on druid on Youtube, if you want to "cheat". I wouldnt do it if I could start over from scratch tho.
---
I'm so looking forward to. The idea of items being recognisable (by name and appearance) is one of my favourite things about old WoW. It really makes it feel more like an RPG.
---
This is not even funny how accurate this was for me back in BC
---
As I said to someone else in this thread, it can't hurt to checkout the Classic WoW Guilds discord, where there are tons of different guild recruiting. Finding one that you agree with wouldn't be difficult as they are systemized into what server type they are going. It is truly a great tool for socializing and planning out stuff with your future guildies, which is extremely good rather tha doing it improv with random people you just so happen to end up with in-game.
---
Though yes, I can't guarantee that every guild there will be a sucsess come classic, but I can guarantee that some of them definitely will.
---
Good luck!
---
Thanks mate! Well, when I was torn between Alliance and Horde - it was always between a paladin that I played in vanilla and shaman that  I have been playing him almost exclusively ever since. So when I decided to roll horde - there is no way I would not pick my shaman.
---
What is the Problem with that? I think 1/2 in arctic reach is perfectly fine if you want an alround build for pvp/pve and farming.
---
Transmog is an abomination but I never understood why some people hate on outfit systems.
---
Have you ever played a game with a decent outfit system? Like LoTRO (the best IMO), Rift, SWTOR, GW2, what's there not to like?
---
Honest question, I'd like to understand.
---
The people conditioned to keep paying for micro transactions etc won‚Äôt all turn away I‚Äôm afraid. Some will, but habit is a powerful human force, and many will stay. The best hope for gamers who know better are indie devs, as sadly big corporations are not like to release many good games for a long time now. The few they do will not be high priority either.
---
I leveled in 2003. There were 920 total skill levels obtainable at F2P and 1200ish total in the game.
---
And leveling back then was a completely different thing.
---
I did pretty good, trust me.
---
ok then, what makes a lock more complicated in pvp than a mage?
---
It always amazes me that USA, country which is supposed to be front line in everything still has such awful internet. For me 50mb is included in rent. I wanted upgrade so I pay 5 EUR to get it up to 100mb.
---
Same here
---
Because you can tell they don‚Äôt see the same as you. Gtfo
---
The obvious compromise here is to have a few servers hold a higher cap. Streamers and similar people would be drawn to those
---
Human lock :)
---
You trying to draw a distinction between blizzard and activision? If so, bad news: there is none. Blizzard is at best a corpse and activision is selling you tickets to its funeral. Repeatedly at that.
---
Hi, /u/Allthisweleavetoyou
---
https://youtu.be/UNHSOBkCYBk
---
This is an extremely informative video. Some of it won't make sense as a new player, but as you level it will. He has videos like this for every class.
---
Basically you want to level as feral. This is the most efficient kill speed. As feral you can tank dungeons with ease, but you can also heal if you have a set of gear for healing. Balance isn't a good spec, while it can have its place it has a lot of mana issues which is not good for leveling.
---
As far as gear goes you want to look out for agility and stamina until you're a higher level. Agility will increase your critical strike chance which will benefit you more than strength which will increase your overall damage. At higher levels strength becomes more valuable. Items with +% to hit are very valuable and it is a very worthwhile stat to seek out.
---
For healing gear intelligence and spirit is your go to. This will give you a bigger mana pool and let you regenerate it quicker. At higher levels +healing and to a lesser degree +mana per 5 seconds plays a role.
---
You're going to spend a ALOT of time leveling, and if you keep an eye out and read a few guides while doing so it's all going to come together. Unless you're especially inattentive and don't give a shit you will have a decent grasp of whatever class you play by the time you hit 60.
---
I just gave in and played pserver. 3 months in and I'm in tier 2 having killed nef. Aq40 tonight. Started raiding zg MC and aq20 pugs as soon as I dinged 60. On a mage.
---
HI IS YOUR NAME ALSO GRUMPY OLD PARANOID PERSON? NICE TO MEET YOU
---
That‚Äôs the dumbest notion. Yes obscene work hours are utterly immoral and should be made illegal, but that doesn‚Äôt somehow invalidate other issues. One persons suffering never invalidates another, grow up.
---
If you are clearing BWL to get to Ashkandi then you definitely do not need it to clear MC.
---
We know that the realm cap was purely a gameplay decision, not a technical one.
---
We also know that the debuf limit was purely a technical limitation and they hated it from a gameplay point of view.
---
They did re-implement the debuf limit to be as accurate as possible. How can we even assume that one of the most important points, the realm population, is going to be changed?
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation, I will definitely watch the video as soon as i can.
---
Yeah definitely. Look at games like Dwarf Fortress. Pain for ten hours and then it slowly starts to click and you can't put it down.
---
I've played Mount and Blade off and on every few months since it was released. That's another game where you're just thrown into the fray with only a very simply tutorial to guide you.
---
Funniest thing I've read all day
---
In Australia I pay like 70 dollars and dont even get that much
---
Imagine the outrage if we don't have a date by the 16 of may ! :D
---
Skins should still be unlocked by effort, not wallets, but aye cosmetics is the least fucked up thing to micro transact.
---
maybe it's balanced because doing the same amount of progress in bfa takes 20 minutes
---
BRE is BiS for warriors, nothing compares. Ashkandi is a cool weapon but it's barely meh, thats why hunters and rets get it.
---
Amen.
---
you can heal anything upto the 55-60 instances as any spec. The instances are not tough. Even tanks will have mixture of gear in these instances.  Once you're 55, you can respec if healing is your thing. I love healing on my shammy and I plan to make it my main when classic is released. I'll level as Ele till 55, then go full Resto, and instance my way to 60. 
---
The Onyxia attunement quests, and the UBRS key quests require you to  go back to LBRS/UBRS several times, so great to do it as resto and pick up easy XP from group instance runs. A Full instance clear gives silly XP, and would be faster than trying to grind as a healer. Also, you are mostly done with the attunements :)
---
Pleasee I'm so keen for classic I will cry if there are no oceanic severs. Especially pvp ones I want to melt the faces of my enemies
---
This is honestly one of the things I am looking forward to the most.
---
Ouch man
---
I don't see a point comparing one time sink to another. Playing WoW is wasting time but it's fine if you enjoy it. That's what hobbies are for.
---
I don't want to be negative, but I find this quite shit. 
---
And you hiding your bars/buffs. 5.1k hp, clearly you got a lot of buffs.
---
Huh a lot of good there actually. Does not seem like the biggest budget tho, I‚Äôd definitely say his point still stands.
---
people have always purchased currency in multiplayer games. this is a human reality. we pair up to cheat systems.
---
In 2003 there wasn't even a pay2play / free2play differentiation as Runescape 2 wasn't even released back then. What you are talking about it, is what we know nowadays as Runescape Classic was free to play for everbody until the introduction of Runescape 2.
---
You talk rubbish. Stop it.
---
With the massive advances in server tech in the last 15 years, it won't be hard for them to provision - rent even, these days - enough servers to cope with every single WoW player signing on for Classic.
---
There will probably be a humongous spike for the first month or two, then probably 70+% will have had their nostalgia fix, realise just how hard the level 10mobs hit and how long a slog it was in vanilla and return to retail.
---
Yea i just wanted to point out, that you can and will have to waste more time in osrs
---
The hypocrisy of this reply is peaking
---
Let's see:
---
We can‚Äôt of course know what will happen but we can ballpark. This subreddit has 78K subscribers while the WoW subreddit 1M. We can use the relative interest to gauge potential players. 78K/1000K = 7.8% (Let me stress that I‚Äôm not talking about absolute interest here, there will be many Classic players who are not subscribed to /r/classicwow. However there are also many WoW players who are not subscribed to /r/wow. But we can presume that from all people interested in the games, a similar percentage subscribes to Reddit so the relative number of subscribers is a good indication of the relative interest overall.)
---
How many people are currently subscribed to WoW? Let‚Äôs say 4M (which is very generous, based on everything you can read). So potential Classic subscribers: 0.078 * 4M = 312K. Although most people wanting to play Classic are not currently playing WoW (there was a large survey here, more than 10K replies, 70% said they are not currently playing), there is some overlap.
---
Still, let's say 300K new subscribers for Classic. That's $54M a year. Activision Blizzard's revenue in 2018: $7.5B. **0.72%**: it's a drop in the bucket.
---
&gt; Can anybody confirm or deny that WoW vanilla raiding was easy?
---
It's significanlty easier on the boss mechanics than current WoW. It's not even a comparison. On the flipside, current WoW has less playerside mechanics to optimize outside of DPS/HPS/mitigation. Resource management is not really a thing anymore. Threat doesn't exist.
---
If both of them are dances:
---
* Vanilla WoW is a coreographed ballet.
---
* Current WoW is Hip Hop battle.
---
Both have their appeal and merit. But they are different in what mindset you need to bring.
---
No problem, good luck. 
---
Druid is considered the "jack of all trades, master of none class", which I think is accurate to a degree but as a druid you shouldn't be focusing on one role. You should be shifting in and out of forms, casting spells, casting heals, and using your abilities for different situations. A druid that can weave all their abilities together is scary. It's a very dynamic class. 
---
Just a heads up, if you plan on end game raiding you will almost definitely be pigeon holed into the role of healer which isn't necessarily bad but something to think about.
---
Warlocks (especially on launch) have a far easier time levelling than mages - hunters and locks are the 2 best levellers in general and especially on classic launch.
---
Locks rotation in raids is to spam shadowbolt instead of frostbolt and have no mana concerns.
---
yeah mages are better aoe farmers but locks can easily solo elites like the hederine slayers for eye of shadow etc...
---
Curious about your pvp exp; what rank are you in vanilla and how many glads on live do you have?
---
I'm not sure if you and people with similar opinions to yourself have played since vanilla or not, or whether you're more casual players - in either case it's strange you felt that you should share your opinion.
---
Forget apples and oranges, this is apples and potatoes. OSRS *is* the grind. It takes 100 days /played *at high efficiency* to max all skills, and that doesn't even account for gear, knowledge, quests, diaries, minigames, etc.
---
Having maxing OSRS as your benchmark for grindy games is like having Stalin as your benchmark for mass killings.
---
The distinctions between an RP server and a PvE server faded rapidly.
---
I got pulled up for a non-RP name early on in 2004 (legitimately, but actually incorrectly), in 2006 there were Th√¥rins and B√¢lins wandering around.
---
Well druid is a great class to play. You can level as feral, and DPS in cat form for quests on your own, or if you want to, go ahead and go bear form and tank low level instances in 5 man groups. 
---
Also, you can pop some heals on yourself as you quest and fight mobs. 
---
Have a wee view of some Vanilla wow druid vids on youtube and you'll be totally fine. A druid is a great character to level. 
---
Once you are at level 60, you can decide if you fancy changing and going tree form (healer), or stay DPS, or even go Moonkin form.
---
totally agree, I was IN the backpack!
---
Again, I just want to point out, that people exaggerate of how big of a timesink WoW apparently is, while it still keeps up as one of the less grindy mmorpgs nowadays
---
I can‚Äôt remember saying I didn‚Äôt like transmog! I do like it for customisations! And to answer your question no I haven‚Äôt
---
Summer is June-August: https://www.visittheusa.com/info/weather-seasons :) (There is no "official" standard of "summer" which everyone must follow. A vague remark of "Summer 2019" is just as likely to use June-August as your dates.)
---
r/playrust
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Was it about story? I think there is more story than ever now, making it not easy to navigate for quest designers.
---
But quest design sucked with where you got quests and where you did them.
---
The main reason it may be larger than anybody expects: 
---
3) Lapsed player base. Way, way, way, way more people have played WoW than currently play. I believe that 100 million have tried it. How many millions or tens of millions were serious but quit because they did not like what the game became? Some percentage of that group will eagerly resubscribe.
---
Thanks
---
Healing sounds pretty fun and I will probably be doing that too, but i'm probably gonna be playing a moonboi for the most part (outside of raids)
---
They don't. Everyone I know uses June-August as "summer".
---
It seems in the US it relatively frequent to use specific dates and not the months but it's not universal: https://www.visittheusa.com/info/weather-seasons
---
No its to give you something to chase that stays just out of reach
---
looking at your replies you seem to think that more buttons = more skill. I'm fairly certain from looking at 2 of your replies that you're bad at all competitive games so your opinion is worthless.
---
i love the maps! they are awesome!!!!  
---
i wanna print them out on a huge poster or something for the room in my wall...  
---
Have few questions:  
---
1) Can you make entire map in a single file?  
---
2) If you can do that, can I then use it for wow classic when it gets released? (played classic only for 45 levels on private server so i am noob and need further explanation since i see a lot of "post-pre cata zones" its confusing)  
---
3) Did I tell you how awesome this is?
---
I played alliance when I first started wow...due to the dwarf hunter with the bear in the cinematics at the start. I loved it, and played on the US servers with my Bro (who lived over there). When he came back to the UK, we re-rolled on the EU servers, about 2 months before tBC was released. He had many LARP friends who played as Horde, so we re-rolled horde and since then I've never played an alliance character. 
---
Horde all the way!
---
It just excludes June.
---
I don't know but it seems like a combination of raidbots and pawn no ?
---
I remember trying this with a other tool of theorycrafting
---
Is "don't go down this path" still being worked on?
---
Thank you!
---
I will watch some videos as soon as I can and I'm probably gonna play moonkin for the most part
---
Then dont use add ons.  
---
simple.  
---
But to state that addons is cheating , is absolute nonsense
---
Sandstalker Ankleguards are not bracers. Ankles are at the bottom of your legs, not at the end of your arms! üôÉ
---
Either way, you're right. More AP on the Swiftwalker Boots, I'll make that change.
---
Not sure about striking - time will tell.
---
Boot enchants are debatable, imo mobility is more important than a few extra AP/HP.
---
That was a low odds play. If there is a bell curve of potential dates then July 16 would be in the early, low part before the odds start spiking up. I'd go mid-August.
---
Don‚Äôt know why you got downvoted. Oceanic is around 10% of the US player base.
---
It would definitely be possible. I'm not sure if it would be first or second iteration of the project, but its definitely in the plans right after primary attributes.  That along with any other 'on equip' bonus
---
You're looking at 7 to 12 days of solid play time to hit max level. That's 168 to 288 hours of played time, maybe even more. By today's standards that's insane as a game with a lot of content/replay value can be 60 to 80 hours. I'd argue the game doesn't truly begin until you hit 60. *The game doesn't truly begin until you invest a minimum of 160+ hours into it*. To say that isn't an enormous time sink is insane.
---
With that said there's a lot of knowledge about the game floating around the net. People who were in high school fumbling around in WoW are now in their 30s and have way more experience. Hitting the end game stuff isn't as truly insane as a time sink as it was "back in the day" because the tools and knowledge are out there to be hyper efficient, and even a little bit of that can go very far.
---
WoW is a gigantic time sink and we're going to see the same stories pop up that did back then about people's relationships suffering and their lives imploding, and saying it isn't is disingenuous  at best
---
You could be the warlocks' shadow weaver in raids
---
"It takes longer to max all skills in OSRS than to get 60 in WoW" is not an opinion. It doesn't mean WoW isn't much of a timesink just because there's a bigger one.
---
Tell that my past me, i probably spent the same amount of time on classic as someone in runescape in the same time span üßê
---
Yeah the grind is the game. In WoW you grind to do the things you want to do.
---
Came here to distress post... Tokens will ruin the econ..
---
Moonkin is very bad and is just about the only spec for any class that I'd say doesn't really have a real place in the game.
---
If you want to nuke people you should roll a mage, which I played the entirety of vanilla and love dearly. Amazing class and you won't be disappointed.
---
Nobody said anything about how hard it is to adopt to higher pop caps. The issue is recreating the vanilla experience and balance changes regarding spawn rates would be against that, which they said they wouldn't do.
---
I'm not seeing how any of what he said is incorrect.
---
Good choice! Shaman is pretty fun to play. I personally plan to make one as my alt because I have to play druid. I have been druid main up to this day from day 1.
---
Show us a picture of it!   
---
That's an awesome idea to get some of the old gang back togheter!
---
Yes mages can replace it fully in AQ. But you kinda want Neltharions tear before you replace the chest.
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I created my guild before last year's Blizzcon. People have come and gone (and I'm sure there will be more) but most members are looking strong. We got to know each other (somewhat, of course), the Discord is lively.
---
Because Classic will take a long time (2-3 years at least) I think it's a good test of the commitment required to have people in the guild even with little activity and them not leaving.
---
The only thing thst can stop a bad guy with SL is a good guy with SL
---
Fr though im calling my shaman squad over to purge yo ass
---
Gnomes can‚Äôt be warriors
---
If you want to add weight to your faction choice then join a PvP server :P
---
Will definitely try some other classes--like elem shaman--so I will probably try mage as well.
---
I'm thinking about playing moonkin as it looks like the most fun to me, but that might change as i have never played classic.
---
There is no guild for me right now recruiting, so I go in blind and meet people.
---
If you are without a guild, you will get enough invites.
---
Chaduin vs. Baduin
---
Roll Paladin 9/10 times*
---
It's similar to the old AskMrRobot where you could input your own stat weights and it wasn't shit thinking they knew best.
---
That‚Äôs the whole point, they have nothing to say, no content to create. All their videos are basically ten minute self suck with the sentence of value somewhere near the end
---
To continue this point, high FPS is useless if your monitor cannot fresh in time
---
Because something being done forever means it's right and shouldn't be changed. 
---
Guess we should bring back slavery then as it was done forever.
---
Mage!
---
How do you guys feel about Paladin vs Priest specifically regarding dungeon group desirability? Is one significantly more likely to get tells begging for heals? I remember people always going after Priests, Paladins not so much.
---
What version added it so it was possible for some bosses to be froze?
---
I definitely remember Ragnaros being frozen after an update that allowed shatter procs
---
Isn‚Äôt this the guy who said maraudon being in the game at launch would be game breaking? Yeah I‚Äôll pass chief
---
Meh, I feel like this is such a filler blue post. Did anyone expect the character limit to be anything but this? I mean its great they're communicating but still.
---
In what sense? The tokens don't generate gold as far as I know. I honestly think it is a elegant solution to gold sellers on paper. But I don't know the long term impact of it.
---
How many people are currently subscribed to WoW? Let‚Äôs say 4M (which is very generous, based on everything you can read). So potential Classic players: 0.078 * 4M = 312K.
---
I was going to comment "anything but gnome warrior" myself
---
Survival hunters are great in PVP. Never had any issues playing one. Hunters are quick to level to 60 and pretty easy to gear too.  A melee hunter is not gonna be good in classic. Your best burst damage is ranged, so you wing clip, frost trap, scatter shot and get back to range quickly (all while your pet can be tearing up your attacker). So they are fun to play. I got to Marshal on my hunter and loved it in vanilla. 
---
Never played a level 60 Pally in Pvp - but leveled one to 60 which was fun.  Played low level BGs and was near impossible to kill and fun.  
---
Mages and Warriors are awesome in PVP. Warriors may be slow to level, but you can gear up quite quickly with PVP reward gear and the better gear, warriors are tough, and a great class to play.
---
Thanks for the references,  I wasn't aware of them previously.  I suppose that it would be very similar,  but instead be more of a research tool to determine the best gear based on those weights ahead of time rather than a comparison to current gear. 
---
For instance let's say you're level 50 and want to determine which quests or instances you want to do to get the best gear going into level 60. You would be able to put the weights in and see that you can get a lvl 55 item that will be best in slot until 59 at which point another item will be better. 
---
Ideally you would also be able to look at that item and see that it has a 2% drop rate, but the next best thing is a quest reward. So instead of running that instance for the best item for that level , you would prioritize doing the quest first and then the instance.
---
This reads like one of those WoW commercials
---
Photoshop was grinding to halt when both were on the same workspace. The Extra Large image file is the source file. When one one is opened with all the layers the program it eats up the maximum amount of RAM that I can assign (80% of total RAM so currently at 24GB of my 32GB) After that it starts eating all my SSD storage, so I separated them for performance issues.
---
  The non WoW:Classic zones are sealed away (paths removed) and the Points of Interest are faded to show the difference. So if you see a place marked and it is faded, it is not there in WoW:Classic.
---
  Thanks for the kind words
---
Paladin is a solid choice. I'm rolling one aswell.
---
People often describe it as boring (maybe it is a little), but you do have the possibility to fulfil 3 roles. I honestly like ret alot in pvp, it's pretty strong and has good utility/heals.
---
For the PVE aspect, you can still heal pretty well with a ret/holy build.
---
Priest are a bit more versatile in dungeons (Shield, renew, shadow word pain for more dmg) where as paladins are more straight up healing. Priest also brings Shackle which is really good in quite a few dungeons. Paladins being a lot of different ultility through blessings, and survivability (doesnt nessisarily die instantly if you get aggro through healing). Generally i would say priest is a bit better for dungeons, but paladins are probably better for raids. BUT you shouldnt have a problem getting into dungeons as a paladin, or raids as a priest. At the end of the day, a healer is a healer, and you are going to be very desirable along side tanks.
---
It allows people to buy gold. So, if you have money to throw around IRL, you can have free money in game putting in no effort.
---
Good point. I just feel like the honesty thing makes the game so much better. But that's unrealistic.
---
the comment literally says including ice barrier ice block and &gt;&gt;&gt;shatter&lt;&lt;&lt;.
---
Best gaming experience of my life
---
So like the BiS pre-raid but with item 100% sure ? Can be interesting
---
I like the idea behind your post but the reality is just different. Gold will be bought, and was bought in vanilla, regardless of wether you want it or not and regardless of bans. Yes some people got banned but the vast majority of gold buyers/sellers didn't.
---
Now with the decrease of customer service this will be even a bigger issue. You basically have two options: People buying gold from gold farmers or people buying gold from tokens. Pick your poison.
---
Orc (male) in a dress look like shit though.

RIP Bear

[Here is a list of the many LFG threads we've had, and there will be another one every Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). Might be worth having a look through that to see if any stick out for you.
---
please dont make it public i dont want ilevel shit in vanilla
---
‚ÄúThis game isn‚Äôt as big a time sink as &lt;other massive time sink game&gt; so people are wrong to consider Classic WoW a time sink‚Äù you could also point out that Classic WoW isn‚Äôt as much of a time sink as school 5-18 (~833 days/played) or a simple undergraduate degree (~90 days/played).
---
OTOH 1v1 is often a fair and fun fight, and just becomes boring for one side (the side which gets help) as its no longer a challenge, and annoying/frustrating for the other, because it's not fair and there's often not a lot you can do about it.
---
I raided BWL with my rank 13 set and pvp frost spec no issues and half way through the insect one with a elemental spec scorch spam.
---
That was already the case in vanilla. Many, many people bought gold and didn't get punished for it. I expect the same to happen in classic, anything else is... naive.
---
The biggest money has always been in milking the plebs
---
The game was by far more hardcore than it is today.
---
Don‚Äôt underestimate how hard it was to get 40 people willing to farm specific gear.
---
Watch curses patchwork world first kill
---
The encounter is so freaking simple mechanic wise, but it did not matter
---
https://youtu.be/2BeXWbqeKTk
---
They had perfect gear and their tanks drop like hell, they wiped to healers oom and enrage timers
---
Now imagine people that think the encounters are easy, with not so good gear try to kill patchwerk - they won‚Äôt
---
Simply because:
---
Their healers will run out of mana
---
Damage won‚Äôt be enough - Patchwork will enrage - top guilds knew the best builds for damage back than, it was still hard
---
And their tanks will just take to much damage
---
And that was the case with so many encounters back than.
---
Also People on the modern Classic servers will wonder, because the whole game is a lot easier there  due to bugs.
---
Prot is for PvE, if you would only be wanting to go prot for warrior but want to pvp, thats a no-go. Although there are 31/x/x specs that are suitable for pvp and some tanking.  
---
Survival isn't really a melee based hunter. Decent pvp though, and well, I guess in pvp you will be in melee some amount of the time. You like to be ranged most of the time though if possible.
---
Do you want to dps in pvp? Pally is really more suitable for healing in pvp than dpsing as ret. If you want to heal pally is good option but I think it's the most boring/stale/easy to play class regardless.
---
If you want to BOOM in pvp mage is a great option. Really, mage is so versatile for someone that doesn't have time for more than 1 main character. You can farm great! Mage is strong PVE, world pvp, BGs, 1vX...
---
Well that would be one use-case.  You'd also be able to determine the best gear to get during the leveling process and potentially use it as an alternative for finding the best/easiest gear to obtain for pre-raid or raid gear.
---
...That's double what I got *available* here.
---
The problem with gold selling/buying isnt just the chineese botters hackers and farmers.
---
The real problem with goldbuying/selling is killing the game progression by spending euro's.
---
Gold is part of the progression.
---
TBH you could find an ilvl for any piece whether this app idea was available or not, this would just help you determine where to get the better gear for your current attributes or spec.
---
You said you didn't understand how tokens effect the economy. I explained. Don't call me na√Øve for answering you.
---
Yeah transmog is one thing I'll miss. Granted it's low down on the list but I don't understand the hate either. It would be nice if you could toggle it like other options as a personal setting.
---
Besides a large portion of people still seem to fundamentally misunderstand how it works, you can't be a level 12 looking like you wear thunderfury, you have to actually get the item to mog it. Nobody will be wearing T3 without actually having T3 etc.
---
I also don't buy the PVP arguement, never have I ever bothered looking at gear to see how scared I should be in PVP. Stop being weak, either take the fight regardless or run away, and if it's in a BG, any mystery lasts one fight only, then you know the guy is either strong or just wearing a lot of stamina gear. But it could be perma disabled in BGs regardless of personal settings (don't see why?).
---
Not that I am advocating putting it into classic, just feel like the 2 main arguments against it are fucking ridiculous.
---
Aiming for and achieving is not the same my friend.  
---
Imagine seeing that one priest on your server with full T3 walk around Orgrimmar and you're stil working on you're T2 set. It gives you that instant "oh wow that looks so cool" feeling, and also motivates you to push on and maybe eventually get into a Naxx clearing guild yourself.
---
&gt;Warlocks (especially on launch) have a far easier time levelling than mages
---
Faster, not much easier. We have a pet yes, but mages can AoE grind and kite.  Mages can also escape ganks easier with shields, slows and blink. Warlocks have fear but if it's a higher level player then good luck landing the fear.
---
&gt;Locks rotation in raids is to spam shadowbolt instead of frostbolt and have no mana concerns.
---
Warlocks can use dots and they generate far more threat than a mage and therefore have to ride the lightning on the threat meter. 
---
&gt;yeah mages are better aoe farmers but locks can easily solo elites like the hederine slayers for eye of shadow etc...
---
The eye of shadow is a less than 1% drop on a slayer and they don't drop much other than runecloth. It's the BL demons that drop them regularly and they are level 63 and can't be enslaved. The only reliable farming strat is Maraudon and that's far below what a mage can do in DM or ZG.
---
&gt;Curious about your pvp exp; what rank are you in vanilla and how many glads on live do you have?
---
Rank 13 on Warlock and 11 on mage. Not sure what gladiator has to do with vanilla since it came out in TBC.
---
To play a mage in PvP is much easier than a warlock. Except perhaps flagrunning. But like all classes they have a high skill ceiling. In wPvP the warlock definitely has a much higher skill ceiling than a mage. I'm not sure in BGs, they have very different roles to play. 
---
&gt;I'm not sure if you and people with similar opinions to yourself have played since vanilla or not, or whether you're more casual players - in either case it's strange you felt that you should share your opinion.
---
Yes I have. I don't trust people's 15 year old memories.
---
Then I hope I recieve my paycheck from Blizz \^\^ Was really suprised that the guy went with it, I have only seen a younger guy (maybe 25y.o.?) wearing Blizz merch around here but this was the first time I met this guy here. I understand that it looks like a commercial but that situation made my day and thats whats important to me. I just wanted to share it, because if anyone ever told me about it, I'd say it's impossible to happen.
---
If you are going feral, you are surely going to be running Gnomer for maces, but most classes have to farm something for raiding, so i wouldnt let they deter you. Secondly you arent going to be able to selfheal to the same degree you could i MoP, purely because of mana issues. However it should be possible for you to find a guild where you can raid as Feral, if you are off tank bear / dps cat when not needed to tank
---
Wether we will have tokens or not: People will buy gold with real money. The difference is just wether they buy it officially or not. Many people did back then too, and I don't expect it to change.
---
IMO, people take 5 mans too seriously... I used to ret tank dungeons when there was no tank available, and it was really fun. Not everyone wants a perfect, easy, clean, mathematically ideal dungeon experience. xD
---
This now makes me depressed
---
I didn't call you naive.
---
\&gt;   I expect the same to happen in classic, anything else is... naive.
---
 we will see about that
---
Its currently in a employee only alpha test, mentioned in a blue posts a week or 2 ago.
---
Ooh you had so many of us going and I was a bit on the fence but the slavery reference gives the trolling away too much.
---
You're right he should of phrased it better, how is having tokens any different than people 3rd party buying gold. Not saying I want tokens I'm pretty neutral either way, but RMT is gonna fuck with the economy either way and I don't see one as better then other.  
---
In someways I see third party farming as worse because they mass farm gold causing inflation where as the token just moves it around. But like I said it makes almost zero difference to me.
---
People will buy gold regardless of tokens. It was the reality back then and I don't see a single reason why this will change.
---
Simillar story - Played Alliance with friends here and then I moved to study to Germany for a year. Started playing Horde to play with my classmates and never went back to Alli after.
---
It actually makes sense because a lot of people are turning to video games rather than real life for entertainment because real life is so expensive.  1 meal out at a mediocre chain restaurant can get you a month of wow, playing X hours per day with your friends and having a laugh while also getting lots of nice little dopamine hits from progression
---
There are also a lot of gamers who don't care about competition, and so are completely uninvolved in shooters - and these types love social MMOs
---
The problem is that nobody has made one that really clicked since WoW.  Apart from STO or maybe age of conan, but they both had plenty of issues.
---
Imo the biggest thing they get wrong is making worlds feel persistent and 'real'.  For MMOs you need scale and you need to feel like things are far away, and you need to journey through them.  Instancing and fast travel kill that and you're left feeling like you're playing in detached pockets of the universe that don't really influence each other

Tokens to me just kind of seem like Blizzard's way of going "We can't stop it, so why don't we have the money go to us instead of third parties?" I'd really rather just see a bigger crack down on gold sellers but oh well. I care less on BFA-WoW since nothing seems sacred there anymore.

Click the "Thottbot Theme" checkbox near the top.
---
With the risk of being permabanned way less people will do it.
---
You remember people needing fire resist? Oh really, do you also remember how unfathomably trash people were? Selective memory? 
---
Now, is it possible that if you play the game with 10x higher dps (I.E. not sucking) and using consumables that you wouldn't need fire resist?
---
&gt; why people would want to play the game with features stripped off.
---
Guess what, you can play all the time with PVP flag turned on. The only difference is that it isn't compulsory.
---
&gt;  you can't be a level 12 looking like you wear thunderfury, you have to actually get the item to mog it. Nobody will be wearing T3 without actually having T3 etc.
---
It takes like 0 skill and just a little bit of time to get many of the cool looking transmogs from previous expansions. It's funny you mentioned Thunderfury. It took me exactly 1 hour running around old legion dungeons on my rogue to get the Thundefury transmogs.
---
&gt; I also don't buy the PVP arguement, never have I ever bothered looking at gear to see how scared I should be in PVP. 
---
*You*  don't buy it, but that's one of the features of classic WoW. You get see players' achievements visually, on them. And yeah you should be scared of a rank 14 warrior wearing full pvp set.
---
Gnomes can absolutely be warriors. They can be warriors, rogues, warlocks and mages. They are possibly the best pvp race for warrior on alliance as escape artist helps significantly against roots which normally shut warriors down. And it‚Äôs on a 1 minute cooldown too, making it frequently usable
---
Yeah I feel you on that, but no mmo I've ever seen has been able to take care of RMT and it's not from a lack of trying. 100 % agree they found this "solution" of tokens just to generate money, but like I said it has one nice thing vs 3rd party trading and that's less inflation.
---
Rofl
---
Is that really so? I remember how gold farmers were happily farming and spamming throughout my vanilla experience regardless of bans, and I know of people who bought large amount of gold themselves up until TBC. Maybe that memory is skewed.
---
I've played it, it's just shit.
---
I also see a lot less gold spammers than back in the day which his nice. Then again, their corpse piling ads were a tiny bit endearing.
---
Monk
---
That's not 2 Mb (Mega bit) that's actually 2 MB (Mega byte) which is the same as 16 Mb / s.
---
So that's quite a fast internet you got going there, we had 10 Mb/s, so that's 60% faster download than our maximum would have been.
---
yeah that shit was hilarious in a way the spam never really bothered me, but I get why people don't like it.
---
You are being overly aggressive for no apparent reason. Take a chill pill.
---
Also, be it free for all or not, my point still stands. In 2003 there were not 2200 skill ranks to obtain, not by a longshot. You also needed to go find a bed to rest after mining for 2.5 inventories. 700 ranks back then was much more than 2% of the game.
---
August 8th/9th.
---
The tech to catch sellers/buyers has been increased. Its inposible to stop it all but allowing it is wrong.
---
Well, I guess today instead of work, I shall mostly be scrolling around these maps!
---
Now.. to convince the gf that we need these on the wall..
---
I agree that the best solution is to catch all the buyers/sellers and shut down the gold market. They didn't manage to do that back then though. Maybe it is easier with modern tools. But IMO any solution is better than what we had in vanilla, which was effectively no solution.
---
&gt; Faster, not much easier. We have a pet yes, but mages can AoE grind and kite. Mages can also escape ganks easier with shields, slows and blink. Warlocks have fear but if it's a higher level player then good luck landing the fear.
---
Hence why I said on launch. Mage levelling is S tier alongside hunters and locks IF they can AoE farm - there is no way that'll be possible with the population on launch.
---
&gt; Warlocks can use dots and they generate far more threat than a mage and therefore have to ride the lightning on the threat meter.
---
idk if you've raided but at most you'll use corruption due to debuff limit. Effectively making your entire pve rotation corruption, shadowbolt, and life tap. Equally as easy as mage rotations.
---
&gt; The eye of shadow is a less than 1% drop on a slayer and they don't drop much other than runecloth. It's the BL demons that drop them regularly and they are level 63 and can't be enslaved. The only reliable farming strat is Maraudon and that's far below what a mage can do in DM or ZG.
---
Sure single target might not be the absolute best farms out there but they're still fine and by the way you wrote originally you seemed to imply that mages are significantly better at farming which isn't true in most cases.
---
&gt; Mage really is the no-brain class and that's one of the reasons why I absolutely hate the class. 
---
Do you honestly believe that's true? like all your original points which are comparing mage to lock are so wrong it's unreal. 
---
Mages and locks are same tier levellers. They both have equally easy rotations in pve. Both are good at farming in their own ways. Mage and locks aren't worlds apart in terms of pvp skill cap either. Like if you class mage as 'no-brain' then from your comparison locks would also be a no-brain class.
---
I mean, giving a release date doesn't necessarily mean rushed. We just want to know when so we can start scheduling our lives around the release. Get approved for extended vacation time and so forth.
---
If August is the intended month of release, telling us now or later isn't going to change their time frame if that's when they planned on releasing it in the first place.
---
No, after a while you will become immune to the side effects of mountain dew. That's just how math works
---
Blackrock is full
---
Everyone is going to tell you how great druid is and that everything is viable. But it is, like, the worst.
---
I honestly hope Classic cannibalizes the majority of the playerbase from current WoW and becomes the more popular game active users wise. That would be a real wake up call to Blizz.
---
Sad thought but it's definitely a plausible one.
---
Am I dumb dumb or doesnt that mean it will release im Q2? What is Q2 btw?
---
Pick something that allows you to have fun and isn't too gear dependent. I would probably say Ret paladin if you're only gonna be PvPing for the majority of endgame. They have a fairly high skillcap, they aren't too gear dependent and most of their BIS gear is obtained before aq40. Shouldn't be too hard to get MC spots as a paladin during MC -&gt; BWL since warriors haven't really kicked of at that point. Also you will most likely have prio on 2handers and stam/int/str gear since it's not wanted by any other class.
---
You'll never use VE in a raid setting for that very reason. Mind flay + Shadow Weaving and if you're lucky, SW:P.
---
I used to raid the undead capital with my mage that was fun üòÖ
---
Why would they make them free when hundreds of thousands if not millions of nerds like me are willing to fork over $60 every 2 years for them?
---
&gt; It takes like 0 skill and just a little bit of time to get many of the cool looking transmogs from previous expansions
---
What's that got to do with the price of apples? We're talking about classic, anybody that has TF etc has earned it..
---
&gt; Geez, it's mind boggling how so many here are apparently stuck at 2004 speeds.
---
Rural area in the West. The issue is that communities here are responsible for getting fibre themselves. They also have a mandate to take the lowest bidder for that contract, which often is a firm that compensates that low bid for the upgrade of municipal infrastructure by asking premium price from the people using it. Additionally, they get a fee from all other ISPs that want to offer speeds above minimum (which is a nominal 16 Mb/s, but realistically boils down to 1 MB/s), which means that often enough, the only not-totally-sucky internet costs you double what it should, and is notoriously unreliable (at least here), because no ISP wants to pay their competitors for using their fibre lines. And of course our main ISP (who had been a public entity until around 20 years ago, and in which the state still is a major shareholder) tends to rely on existing copper wire infrastructure to boost speeds ("vectoring"), and apparently even received money to extend the fibre net, which they took and used said vectoring instead of installing fibre in some places.
---
So, yeah, it's 2019, and I'm stuck at 1 MB/s in the middle of Europe thanks to the state and its major corp completely bungling fibre integration. I used to live in a major city, where I *had* good speeds even back in 2006, but even in medium-sized cities (~30K), I was stuck at 1 MB/s.
---
I'm sure you could clear everything in vanilla with nothing except a stack of mana potions on mana users with a decent team.
---
Banning sellers don't help, you need to ban buyers.
---
I pay 10$ for 100/100 speed in Sweden. Hearing about the US internet situations is outrageous honestly.
---
If you think the miniscule risk of getting banned is gonna be a hindrance you're being too naive. I've floated a lot of gold to OOG currency from retail for years and nothing has happened, neither have the people I know.
---
RWT will happen in abundance in Classic.
---
(all 9 pallies in the raid trade eye contact)
---
The cost hasn't gone up because the cost to operate the game has gone down over the years. Less energy usage with more efficient server infrastructure, cheaper bandwidth/storage, less customer service staff required. So it's kind of evened out, in addition to the secondary sources of monetization from 100% profit character services and cosmetic shop. In addition to the $5 premium of buying a WoW token, which means that for every player that pays their sub with gold Blizzard made ~$20/month instead of ~$15. Not to mention the extra $60-70 they earn from most active players every ~2 years for expansion sales.
---
tl;dr - cost of operation reduced over time and additional sources of revenue kept subscription price stagnant.
---
Tanks are definitely the thing you're going to wait for in groups most of the time. I'd roll Warrior if you can put in the time, otherwise Priests will be more fun casually.
---
Can we stop accusing EA of the debacle of anthem. Kotaku's article was pretty clear, the only thing EA did was to force them to release it before the end of it fiscal year.
---
Anthem was crap because of Bioware itself and their lack of visions and decision making. They refuse to look at other looter-shooter, refuse to re-use existing frostbite code, refuse to hear the advice of their OWN texan studio which is in charge of the only MMO they have etc... Hell, even the one (can't recall the name) who was in charge of remaking Diablo 3 loot and progression system (which basicaly saved the game and made it worth) wrote them an open letter telling them what mistake avoid and how to solve them.
---
My hunter buddy was looking forward to upgrading to a Hero class with no pet that focuses on marksmanship type stuff.  
---
Kinda bummed that didn't work out for him lol
---
transmog sucks
---
"The genre, MMORPG, isn‚Äôt popular anymore."
---
That's only because these clown devs can't make good fucking games anymore. There's no way they couldn't hit 10mil+ subs again if they released an MMO as good as vanilla&gt;WotLK, they just don't know how.
---
Someone give him gold!
---
Vanilla gear looked nice across the board. It wasn't as glowy and shiny as in later expansions so it kind of didn't matter what you weared for the most part.
---
Thanks, that's very encouraging. Including if we had everybody in dungeon sets starting in Molten Core, and mostly geared people up through tier sets?
---
I'm in this exact same situation, keen to see what other people think
---
No you haven't. You've logged in, looked at the graphics, probably did half of tutorial island and then given up before you've even scratched the surface.
---
Ofc it will happen. But thats not the same as allowing it and paricipating yourself.
---
Pve? Resto 
---
Its your only option
---
There is also the Classic WoW Guilds Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
Played vanilla WoW, bought gold in vanilla WoW, and realize that problems with it. However, it wouldn't surprise me if Blizzard decided to add the WoW Token to vanilla at a later date. Blizzard gets a cut of the profit, as opposed to gold farmers and account scammers.
---
Would WoW Tokens increase the amount of players who buy gold since it is a legitimate way of skipping the grind as opposed to illegitimate? Probably, maybe.
---
Would it be the "thing that kills the game"? No. All the posts, the video, and the nostalgia talks about the *community* being important, not the grind. Very few people look fondly back to grinding herbs for a week straight in order to afford consumables for the next raid. Rather, it was the thing that threw a lot of people off raiding.
---
I realize the argument is more complex than what I have laid forward here, but I bet the reason we haven't heard anything about WoW Tokens in Classic is because it is still being discussed. It won't be in there at launch, but I definitely see a case where it would be introduced maybe two years down the line either as a catch up mechanic or when people realize how truly grueling the gold grind in Classic can be.
---
I also recently got pitchfork insurance so come at me.
---
Without AoE grinding the mage levels slower because they are inefficient, they have to drink more, it's still as easy though. 
---
&gt;idk if you've raided but at most you'll use corruption due to debuff limit. Effectively making your entire pve rotation corruption, shadowbolt, and life tap. Equally as easy as mage rotations.
---
Depends on the guild of course but usually there are a few slots for dots. Very few use up the entire bar with min-maxing debuffs. And threat is still the biggest issue. If we play safe then it's easy, but we're also missing out on 20-30% of our dps. 
---
&gt;Sure single target might not be the absolute best farms out there but they're still fine and by the way you wrote originally you seemed to imply that mages are significantly better at farming which isn't true in most cases.
---
There's a huge difference. Maraudon requires some gear to do efficiently and even then it's only 30-40g/h where a mage can easily push 80g/h or even as high as 130g/h in ZG and strath. Mage is by far the best moneymaker and they seem unaware of it until they try and play something else. Quite a few raiders in my guild has a mage alt for grinding gold and we're not hardcore at all.
---
&gt;Do you honestly believe that's true? like all your original points which are comparing mage to lock are so wrong it's unreal. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Mages and locks are same tier levellers. They both have equally easy rotations in pve. Both are good at farming in their own ways. Mage and locks aren't worlds apart in terms of pvp skill cap either. Like if you class mage as 'no-brain' then from your comparison locks would also be a no-brain class.
---
Yeah I do. It's definitely the easiest class I've ever played and they get good results from it. Paladins are also quite easy, especially in raids. Warlock uses shadowbolt, one of three curses, corruption, shadowburn and life tap. Occasionally searing pain on trash. 
---
Mages use frostbolt and mana crystals. I'll agree that mana management is harder on a mage, especially as a fire mage on long fights. I just feel that most fights in vanilla are not long enough to where mana becomes a problem. Depends on how good your guild is I guess. Life tapping was a problem during vanilla but nowadays it's almost encouraged because healers can snipe better and climb the meters.
---
BS have a trinket that immune you to fear for 30sec (or was it 20s?).
---
If you're serious about pvp, I would recommend making yourself a +shadow resist gear, just equip it when you're facing a lock/Spriest and they won't touch you, the only downside is that you'll lose stats and do way less damage but at the end if you resist every spell of your opponent you win
---
I'm not sure you'll find many + spell damage gear while levelling though.
---
Well you never know. They could have been using the Hollywood definition of summer!
---
Hey Frost love your videos man, thanks for making the wait that much more bearable.
---
Big true.
---
Playing with decent ping is going to be amazing.
---
Mage is super easy and super op in every part of the game. Literally every part. PVE, PVP, WPVP, making money, leveling, farming, ganking, getting ganked and luxury through portals and conjure food.
---
fuck off
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted. You're correct. However, I don't think YouTube was a very popular source as it is today. I remember reading text guides and looking at screen shots more often than anything. I even made a few PvP videos playing vanilla. Anyway, I'm not arguing. Just pointing out my experience.
---
ISP tech here. This is incorrect. Wifi in general is always going to be hyper inconsistent. Even more so with all that equipment around the PC. 
---
A set up like that, you 100% want a Hardline to that PC.
---
It sounds strange....but I felt there was less drama on Horde. Back in vanilla most younger kids who played rolled alliance characters as horde were seen as the "baddies." :D
---
To be fair, wih modern knowledge, access to information, and people no longer playing on toasters with dial up connections most of Vanilla raids will be trivial if people are prepared enough.
---
The difficulty was preparation. Getting everything you need to raid, having people on time, not DCing mid raid, being able to use voicechat was a big chore back in days. Honnestly most strats/mechanics in Vanilla are straight forward once you know it. Rotations are a non factor as most DPS classes are a 1 button spam (Hello there frost bolt and shadow bolts). 
---
It also depends on what you compare it to on Retail. Current mythic raiding is a million times harder than any vanilla content.
---
&gt;'I don't believe what they already told us because i wish it wasn't true'
---
&gt; considering you've forgotten one of the most iconic fights in vanilla
---
I have not forgotten the fight. I have forgotten a detail implementation of a core attack. Huge difference but surely the same sh*t for someone like you.
---
&gt; yet you are weighing in on a theorycrafting discussion about a strat that hasn't even been used effectively
---
And again: why wouldn't I? Just because something hasn't been done yet doesn't mean that it's unfeasible. When the theorycrafting checks out it's likely that great players will be able to use it in a huge amount of fights.
---
And yes, I agree, my bold statement of "NAME ONE FIGHT..." was over the top and has been shut down rightfully, but it doesn't mean that this strategy isn't feasible on the other fights. 
---
&gt; with people that have no clue trying to post advice
---
And again you are just WRONG. Neither have I given any advice nor given any advise. I was challenging people to name fights where it would not be possible to act on the melee weaving strategy. People have rightfully named a couple but by no way have they destroyed the strategy as a whole.
---
And this is where the mayor parts of the asshole fraction just is nothing but a stupid bunch of jerks. Because there's a handful of fights where weaving is not possible they call the whole strategy useless. And that's simply a false statement and I quite honestly don't care how many downvotes I get. Reddit - in general - turns into a feast for the idiots once any sub breaches a certain number. One can't have proper discussions anymore because there's only black and white. And arguably, given the noise the assholes do it's mostly black...
---
For Priest, you can go shadow and still heal like a god, gear is nearly the same since you'll be stacking spirit all the way to 60.
---
For Sham, the early lvl are better done as enh when it comes to solo content (quest, grind,...) but you'll still be able to heal if you keep an intel/spirit gear in your bag. If you lvl as ele, as I did, same as priest, the gear is nearly the same and you won't have any problem healing dungeon.
---
As for lvl 60 dungeons, you can heal them in shadow/ele spec with healing gear.
---
If you plan on healing in raid I would highly recommend speccing in the healing tree but no one can inspect your talent so along as you don't use your shadow form no one will know.
---
A little tips : if you play on a pvp server, I'd go with a intel/stam gear for solo content while lvling and keep intel/spirit gear in bags for dungeons, you never know when someone will jump on you and in a pvp fight spirit won't help you much + take those little enchant people are giving for free in capital, it doesn't look like much but 3stam here, 1spirit here... make a big difference
---
This is so true it hurts. A sad, sad reality.

Hey, I can see why everyone is getting confused over this but this is actually talking about the User Interface version that's used in the addon API.   
---
Version 80000 is BFA (BFA is version 8.0 onwards) and version 11300 is actually in reference to the franken-patch Classic WoW is running on, which is version 1.13. The number is just the version number of the WoW client without the dots.  
---
You use these numbers in addons to tell the game client what version the addon is made for.   
---
You can go into any one of your WoW addons for retail OR undocument servers and go into an addon's folder (eg: ElvUI) and open the .toc file type inside there. At the top it'll have a line that says "Interface: xxxxx" where 'xxxxx' is the number this post is referencing to.  
---
tl;dr: Don't fear, Classic isn't getting WoW tokens. This post is either trolling or misinformed and in actuality it's just the addon API version.
---
My coworker plays the re-release of runescape at work, and last week he fished up 15000 lobsters, then cooked them all.  
---
Grind indeed.
---
screenshots. etc. you just know.
---
true true. i agree.
---
Yes, flasking every raid is private server thing, people didn't do that in vanilla. Originally flasks didn't last through death so really no one used them at all except for progression fights where you really needed the boost and thought you were close to a kill. They were definitely more popular after the change, but there just wasn't a culture of competing for boss kill or raid clear times. Once people knew they could kill bosses they tended to just farm gear or bring in alts or whatever, they didn't spend hours theorycrafting how to do it faster or farm hundreds of gold to knock an hour off clear times.
---
tl;dr
---
Meme spec + not willing to minmax = 100% recipe of failure.
---
You cant
---
Object 10 mins 9 seconds video into my veins.
---
Everytime I see someone ask "So how are warlocks for DPS end game?" or "Will I be able to get a raid spot as a hunter?" I get flashes of brilliant red anger...
---
The issue is that it'll take time for the whole raid to gear up. Several weeks of running MC to gear up 40 people suitably, and then you have say a further 10 others in the guild who are willing to raid.  So not everyone will be well geared. 
---
When starting MC, I'd be looking to have all blues, and have all my gear enchanted. I'd have the best elixers/flasks possible as it max's my output. Having mana pots, and such help too. IF you have 40 folk doing this, then it considerably helps make the raid easier and faster - not talking speedruns but just more DPS, better Health pools, bigger healing numbers etc.  
---
So having the best gear you can, and the best consumables you can gather, will make life easier for the entire raid. I'd doubt very much that an average guild, will clear MC in their 1st run. Most top end, hard-core guilds will.  Even having done MC for years back in vanilla, there are still some challenging boss fights.
---
can confirm. it just works that way.

2 MBit was slow even by 2005 standards. 10 MBit was the default for most apartment buildings in the small towns where I lived at the time.
---
Fantastic, that's what I was hoping. I'm looking to run or be part of a guild that certainly wouldn't shy away from taking optimal specs, but also would have a sizable number of hybrids or un-ideal specs, too. I'm all for a challenging game but I was hoping that the parameters would be wide enough to make this playstyle viable.

Which pserver give people free tier 2?

If you're not choosing class based solely on the lore descriptions in character creation, YOURE DOING IT WRONG.

---
I'm honestly not hyped for tbc at all. If they released tbc classic, i would probably just roll another alt on vanilla classic again, rather than play tbc. Just me tho
---
Paladins are great for 5 mans. BoP saves so many mage/fury warrior/warlock deaths when they draw aggro, DP means the healer is basically never in danger of dying, and of you get blessings which are some of the strongest buffs in the game as well as an aura.
---
The only real problem is no aoe healing, but their throughput and efficiency is high enough that it's never a problem as long as you're paying attention.
---
The 2500 limit is the vanilla population cap. It is the cap the game was built around and is the likely cap for classic since once you allow more than that many people into a server at once things break down. The economy becomes an issue, respawns are a problem because too many people kill too much stuff too fast, quests become impossible due to overcrowding. PvP is everywhere all the time due to overcrowding of zones, and farming or leveling a gathering profession becomes near impossible.
---
Yeah, I think they will allow you to trade a token with another player on your realm in exchange for their gold.
---
Dont tell me how to live my life
---
Yeah, I don't know what sort of nerve I hit here but the original cap should be the classic cap or they will have to make a lot of changes to avoid the broken nonsense of the overcrowded private servers.

The photo has 2MB/s which is 16Mb/s, internet providers use Mb/s when talking about the speed. So his download rate is well above the average in 2004/2005.
---
I had 2 characters in vanilla, 1 main to raid with, 1 alt to farm gold with and that consumed all of my available playing hours.
---
I cant wrap my head around having 10 alts going at same time, respect for ppl who make it work.
---
You've met gamers before, right? :D
---
Whilst I avoid a lot of games that have too many lootboxes etc, I do find that gaming is a lot more enjoyable if you... *let yourself* enjoy it. I have nearly every console and a kickass PC. I play whatever I like. Hurrah for me and my games, big and small!
---
Hey people think this place is fucking google. "Whats a good talent build for warrior!?" Some idiot posts instead of taking 3 seconds and googling it jesus.
---
RIP Wildstar. If you'd taken off I'd be hooked up to that sweet combat drip right now :\*(
---
I think it's their way of separating the two. If you could transfer gold between classic and retail it could ruin the economy. Tokens sold in Classic will require you to actually farm the gold on the server it's being sold.
---
Not related to your question, really, but this reminded me of a story:  
---
In vanilla, around lvl 55, I (ret paladin) ran into a lone shaman in Un'guro crater and we fought. I won because paladins were overpowered, but when he came back, we found a private spot and dueled for almost an hour. Each bout, I would leave him at 5-10% to avoid a corpse run, and we would drink to full and fight again.  
---
It was probably the first time either one of us had the opportunity to duel our faction-specific counterparts and it was a blast.
---
Lol "don't be a tryhard also if you don't use the exact debuff slots I think are worth it psh you are a try hard."
---
I don't understand how me saying "the elitist way isn't the only way" is tryhard. It's literally the opposite
---
Only thing we were watching on YouTube were pvp videos, boss kills, and the early beginnings if machinima.  I don't ever recall following a guide via video while playing vanilla
---
#nochanges
---
Hit does nothing for heals, they always land.
---
You do not need +hit as a healer unless you have a utility spell (shadow weaving priest for example). Spell hit will give you no benefit when healing allies.
---
And then make a zone-locked UIM
---

---
How can you have nightfall and conflag at 40?
---
You forgot the ret pally in a wheelchair.
---
I think you're going to struggle with this build. 
---
Your melee damage will suffer from not having the 3% hit from the prot tree which would have to be made up by gear, which means you're limiting your effectiveness on the spell side. 
---
From a gear point of view, you'll have to balance between increasing your spell effectiveness whilst maximizing melee output. 
---
I would recommend probably going shockadin / clothadin if you are thinking spell damage / healing rather than trying to have melee involved too, otherwise you're just spreading yourself too thin to be effective in anything.
---
Every time I've tried its been the same story. The entire ride is just having my leveling interrupted by some level ?? Rogue that just wants to stop me from playing the game. 
---
Then I say "Hey help me" and they say "Hey fek uff m8"

Thank you for that thorough answer :) I'll keep that in mind and at least try to have mana pots and flasks, and set that precedent for the guild going forward. It would be nice to have that margin of error, especially when we're progressing on our very first raid, together, still getting to know each other and some people even probably still getting to know their classes. On the flip side, it's good to know that the requirements aren't \*that\* intense on entry and that, hey, there will be some nice challenges right out of the gate :)
---
But it's not the same back end code. Every piece of software used on the back end has received several new versions since vanilla. The hardware is vastly upgraded. Unless Blizzard says it'll be 2500, nobody here can guarantee that number. If you have a link to where they said it, I'll admit my mistake.
---
You forgot:
---
"DAE think {{ feature}} in retail is shit?"
---
"Can I be the MT of a guild and get thunderfury/scarab mount/sever first kel'thuzad if I can only log in once a week for 10 minutes on my guardian druid?"
---
The mechanics were fairly easy and so were the rotations, the difficulty came in the form of gear checks which mean that you were essentially time gated until your raid had reached the appropriate gear levels.
---
Retail (mythic raids) is almost the complete opposite. Gear isn't as important but the mechanic difficulty is insane and the rotations a lot more complex which means that the difficulty has shifted from time to skill.
---
Flasks are way more expensive than all the other consumables combined.  If you're a melee dps you won't even need flasks.
---
replace class with job and find a pattern :-)
---
I saw a kid wearing a Horde t-shirt once at the store, he was infront of me and when he saw the cash total he said "I dont have enough money for all of this" he'd found himself a  frozen pizza, some soda and some candy. So, the kind soul I was I said "For the horde" and I paid the missing amount for him. The lady in the registrer looked at me like I was some sort of new age pedophile. Even the kid got fucking awkward. So, I tried to be kind. Ended up kinda looking like a pedophile.
---
you don't, build wasn't finished ofc, got to nightfall + shadowburn
---
For dome reason I can't stop laughing at this. Hes reversing really hard
---
For MMO's, I always just base my decision on what class is most sought after in PvE content. I want to be the prettiest girl at the ball :)
---
Glasgow. You?
---
Heals cant miss so dont need any hit chance, casters prio it just like melee. If frostbolt doesnt land, your spell dmg and crit chance are worthless. Think its 6% for pvp (5.something to have 0 chance of missing any ability or spell against 60 target) and not sure for pve (8.something for 2h melee but think you want it higher for casters)
---
And also more than 30 days of hot pockets
---
Hunter, Mage, Hunter, Hunter, Hunter, in that order.
---
2 to 8 liters per day who would have thought that that could possibly have bad side effects hmmmmüßêüßêüßê
---
I agree with you but also we're seing a decline in the Battle royale games popularity, ppl are getting tired of the mode and the scene suffers for it. To me it looks like singleplayer story AAA games are making a comeback like Cyberpunk etc. making the big bucks.
---
Just double up on the injector, 2 needles, 1 for insulin, 1 for lovenox.
---
There are people who still think they will increase server population.
---
There‚Äôs not so get sad now so you‚Äôre not sad while actually playing the game
---
SEND SOME FAXES!
---
The thing is, by the time you're guild is ready for MC with 40 suitably geared players, who've all done the attunement quests, and who are doing Ony too, many guildies will have maxed out professions. 
---
So getting consumables shouldnt be as tough. Get guildies to craft them for you, check out the individual mats for flasks and enchants, and ask guildies to make them and enchant your gear. 
---
Also, by 60, farming gold isnt too tough, just time consuming.  After a month in MC and doing Ony, you'll be able to use less consumables and such, or save them for progression fights in BWL. :D
---
Is this updated for 1.12 item stats?
---
Taking an argument to absurdity isn't trolling. Its a useful technique to show how silly you're being. 
---
Arguing that things should stay as they are just because that's how they are is silly. Can you try another argument to convince me why using a term that excludes a large portion of your intended market for a product isn't silly?
---
Something with GTX 1050 or 1050Ti and decent CPU should be more than capable. From used older ones GTX 965M or better I would say. You can go lower and lower with settings but that breaks the immersion.
---
Best part about making solo alts. We always have group chars and solo chars. For us, it makes the leveling experience a lot smoother.
---
I have played with other people who don‚Äôt do this and advance at a faster rate and it creates unnecessary disconnect within the party. Unless if we talk about it first, leveling ahead on the group toons is an insult to the group mates. In any multiplayer game, good communication with friends/guildies is required in order to make sure everyone has fun! See you in classic :)
---
Are the no-micro transactions confirmed? I imagine they're going to put some in there ... Activision loves that sh*t.
---
Vanilla isn't that hard, chief, not that you would know.
---
What is this bullshit OSRS gatekeeping? I'm a kid of the 90s course I played fucking runescape piss off, accept the fact that not everyone enjoys your shitty game.
---
If Blizzard selss gold, the gold sellers will sell gold for less cash.
---
Most people that have commented so far are solely focused on the "mechanical" aspects of raiding. And in that reguards, yes, vanilla is by far the easiest raiding out there. Bosses in MC and BWL are for the most part a joke when you know how the mechanics of the fight works.  
---
The end of AQ with C'thun and a lot of Naxx however will show you how Blizzard as a company learned and developed during vanilla. Show me one group of 40 that can run into C'thun or 4-horsemen and have every single one performe perfectly just by looking at a youtube video.  
---
Then there's the different argument to the dificutly level of vanilla raiding. When you compare it to later expansions, specialy the current retail, there's no doubt that bosses are way easier mechanicaly, and that the overall cleartimes are faster for most part.  
---
But what people then to forget when talking about vanilla raid dificulty are game mechanics that are a complete non issue in current retail.   
---
\- Healers manamanagement, downranking heals, stophealing. In current retail and many expansions before that mana was never an issue for healers, it's been all about healing constantly, then popping your CD's at the right time. If your healers are spamming their max rank heals during vanilla the odds are that most of them are oom before you're halfway through the fight.  
---
\- Threath management, this was so big during vanilla raiding and is a complete non issue atm. Firemages not being able to manage the ignite stack between all the mages in the raid would make the boss encounter spiral out completely. DPS-warriors getting a massive crit at the start of the fight could completly fuck up the tanks ability to possition the boss corretly.
---
\- Then there's the class mastering in vanilla that you just don't have in retail. The classes and specs in retail have been cut down to where there is no "useless" spells anymore, and there is hardly any (not saying there is non) room for error on "how you should be" playing your class.   
---
So I would sum it up like this:  
---
Mechanicaly, learning the fights and what the individual bosses do = easier.  
---
Mastering your class, the ins and outs, does and donts = harder. 
---
Managing resources, mana, rage, threath, consumables = harder.
---
Then adding to it the fact that you need to find 40 people to master their class, and be able to work together, and put in the time effort to farm consumables, pre-bis, etc. vanilla raiding is stil a challenge, it's just a challenge in a different way then what retail raiding is.  
---
Now flame on! I know some people won't agree, but this is how I see it. ;)
---
312k players total? are u insane? dont forget the old returning players and the massive private server population that will most defenitly play
---
Levelling: Warrior levelling is s l o w whereas Shaman is much smoother due to your having heals, buffs, and spells on top of decent melee.
---
PVE: No warrior will ever have to worry about finding a dungeon/raid spot if they're willing to tank due to the lack of people who survive the warr levelling process, once you get geared you will be able to top the dps charts too. Enhance Shaman on the other hand is a hard sell in raids compared to a resto shaman or another melee dps. Not impossible in a non-hardcore raidguild - your best bet is to get the nightfall axe and learn how to totem twist for the melee dps group - but something to keep in mind.
---
PVP: Both classes are pretty solid in pvp, I'd say warrior (with gear) is superior to shaman on the whole and while Arms is the better pvp spec Fury also works. Enhancement Shaman is viable (in that a good player can still shred in wpvp vs the average player) but not optimal, you will be expected to play the Ele/Resto burst build if you want to get in to serious pvp.
---
tl;dr - Roll a warrior if you're commited to serious raid progression/pvp ranking, roll an enh shaman if yout want a more casual experience.
---
But... you said that you had fun again in that build... So many mis info here :/
---
Why has this been downvoted when it's true.
---
Oh I forgot every single person likes KT while rank 14. First try with no consumes in tier 1
---
Pick whatever you feel like and get good at it.
---
As someone who isn‚Äôt looking to push progression too hard, I‚Äôd much rather have a reliable ret pally than another shithead rogue in the raid. Same goes for a balance Druid and Enhance Shaman.
---
If dps isn‚Äôt a huge issue for your raid group, these specs can totally help in other ways throughout a fight. A key off heal, Lay on Hands, BoP or Salv are all things that can save a wipe and are worth it if you‚Äôre willing to take a hit on dps. Know how to play your class and you can come through in clutch moments to prove your worth.
---
Summer release
---
August 31
---
Calling it
---
You can play on Macs through the program wine
---
Disc priest in classic means being holy priest with power infusion
---
The models are optional however within that option they removed the older animations, not the same.
---
Very well put I must say.
---
At least where I live the summer solstice occurs during what we call summer, and doesn't mean summer starts.  
---
With the solstice definition winter doesn't start until December 22 this year?
---
Thanks for the reply! Oof yeah that is a tough one. Luckily we are trying to sort out classes beforehand to have the smoothest experience. Looking at a rogue, mage, and holy paladin combo. Should be smooth sailing for the most part! 
---
I know that only covers gear, but I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice drops for group leveling!
---
Your right, this is dumb maths.
---
"although this could change as technology and tools evolve"
---
Time to campaign for #changes :)
---
Every one is switching between l‚Äô√¢ge and war and I still don t know if I will play Druid or priest.
---
WoW is available to play on macs actually! But I just needed a cheap laptop for myself as I‚Äôm letting my gf use my MacBook so we can both play together. Thanks for looking out though!
---
By far the hardest part of the hardcore 60 speed runners is the sleep deprivation. /played doesn‚Äôt care about that and you get the nice bonus of more rested. I bet we‚Äôll see hundreds if not thousands of people beat 4days20 to lvl 60 in Classic.
---
As others have mentioned, your heals always land. For spells you always have a 1% of missing, which means you need one less hit than your miss chance to cap. The miss chances look like this when your target is:
---
Same level: 4% chance to miss, 3% hit cap
---
+1 level: 5% chance to miss, 4% hit cap
---
+ 2 levels: 6% chance to miss, 5% hit cap
---
+3 levels (boss): 17% chance to miss, 16% hit cap.
---
Note that the game tells you it's a "resist" even though it actually missed. Vanilla is strange like that. 
---
Some talents like Suppression for warlocks say that it reduces the chance for enemies to resist your spells. This just means increases your hit by x%. Again, poor vanilla wording.
---
Thank you for the reply. I‚Äôll get to watching that as soon as I get some free time today!

---
Ah word, honestly any cheap laptop from amazon/best buy/target will probably run it just fine, WoW isn‚Äôt too demanding
---
If you think only "hundreds of thousands" of people will resub for classic WoW you're delusional. Retail has maybe 2-4 million subs left, MAYBE, and classic WoW will bring in at least that many consistent players, and probably double that on launch. Those are very conservative estimates as well.
---
Would love to see how well a raid full of spriests, boomkins, ferals and rets would perform :)
---
5 instances per hour
---
The animations and characters looked more serious than goofy though. It‚Äôs always been cartoon like, but they took a large step toward [overly animated gestures and silly over exaggeration of movements.](https://images.app.goo.gl/Unug74GyYXi6z5wi9)
---
A significant change from the more serious or subtle animations of the past.
---
I think is the worst phase a subreddit has to go through where it‚Äôs just meta posts making fun of meta posts making fun of meta posts.
---
If someone uses this sub like it‚Äôs google then don‚Äôt answer their question and ignore them and they‚Äôll learn the hard way, if some overly patient person wants to answer them then they can.
---
Thank you for the reply! I totally agree with everything you said. My buddies and I always wondered why mmos didn‚Äôt actually buff exp gain or rewards for playing in groups! I guess debating that could be a whole post on its own hah. See you in classic!
---
Thank you! I‚Äôd like to run it at around 40-60fps on mid settings ideally. I‚Äôll look around for something with those cards. I know classic is already almost a 15 year old game so I was thinking it shouldn‚Äôt take much to run it smoothly.
---
just use your brain for a second instead of getting lost in semantics
---
Which is stupid because you can just have 2 accounts, the only thing it does is give advantage to someone who spends more money which is not what classic should be.
---
Oh god, remember the night elves before they fixed their run animation?
---
Priests OP, druids not so OP
---
This. There was a handful of tank gear checks, and even those could be powered through with the power of late BC healers.
---
That's like 14 gold on retail!
---
If the bromine doesn't affect you at least the sugar will make you diabetic, win win situation here \\o/
---
People think you need to have a million consumables, full best in slot, no classes with meme specs in order to successfully down raid targets in vanilla. 
---
It‚Äôs like yeah all do that stuff makes it easier and easier to complete raids but it‚Äôs time to stop pretending that it‚Äôs the only way to do it. 
---
You literally cannot complain that raiding in vanilla is too easy while at the same time refusing to invite people that want to play sub optimal specializations. If they want to, let them do it. If they don‚Äôt have time or care to farm every consumable possible, then fine. As long as you aren‚Äôt racing for the world first kill then it literally doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
People need to step back and remember the point of this is to have fun. You aren‚Äôt trying to win some PGA tour and make money from your sponsors or anything. Unless your Method. Those guys are probably cuckolds anyway
---
More than enough ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Hopefully we get another frostmourne server
---
It will be a "current" game based on current client - so 64 bit Windows and some other modern requirements. Basic decent dGPU or strong iGPU (likely AMD) and rather good CPU as that likely will be the bottleneck for some laptops (avoid old "U" CPUs)
---
What, Tempest Keep was a fucking loot parade other than Kael.
---
The hardcore content in retail is harder than Vanilla.
---
The casual content in Vanilla is harder than retail.
---
400? I remember being well over 1200 some afternoons.
---
No, we had them is Cata, I moved from aus server to us server, and frostmourne was Australian ping where the us had the usual us ping
---
Ah that's a really good point! Duh, I hadn't thought about all of the guildies being able to pitch in and really make life easier. Might be kind of fun to try to theorize and set up what would be the most efficient farming roster for all of us, just to make us viable and have a smooth time, not for the hardcore end of the spectrum.  
---
I'll have to see what endgame farming for raids looks like in Vanilla, in realistic terms. If it's too bad, may be just dungeon nonsense for me ;) Thanks again so much.
---
It's one lobster every 40 seconds without stopping for a whole week.
---
Your coworker is either exaggerating, botting or there's something I don't know about Runescape (I never played it).
---
The days of how far ahead I felt having 2 mbs internet over my friends with 1mbs or less haha!
---
Thanks for the reply! Yeah I need to ask them the 20 questions of play style and commitment before hopping into it for sure. In mmos we tend to make solo chars and group chars, so if we have to get that extra fix, it‚Äôll be on the solo chars (hopefully).
---
My current hp laptop with dual channel ram, ryzen 5 2500u (vega8) runs the current client on setting 3 out of 10 at 60fps clean in the starting zones in bfa.
---
I played on Nostralia (vanilla private server in Aus) for a little while and it felt so good finally playing the game with a decent ping.
---
My problem with WOW is not grinding.
---
I would take something much worse than that.
---
What i don't like is that I have to be there at fixed hours to raid, because if you don't raid you don't have access to the good gear.
---
Yep, some shady site that makes you a potential ban targed, is the same thing as an "Buy Token button" on the official game forum.
---
People did this, but if you put a legal way for it especially in classic, it will be a disaster.
---
End of August makes the most sense for Blizzard. There's a few reasons why. 
---
1. Right before Q3 filings (big subscription boost) 
---
2. More interest from fans as summer is ended (bad idea to force people to be inside all summer) 
---
3. Allows for next BFA patch to have a hype train 
---
4. Stops other games from pushing a summer release in anticipation that classic wow will draw attention 
---
5. All the kids are back in school and unable to take 2 weeks straight  of PTO 
---
My vote is the 2nd to last Tuesday in August
---
It can happen now and then I agree. But I noticed that people who often complain about getting ganked make no effort at all to avoid getting ganked. And often when you help them, they just do w/e they have been doing before, even if you advise them to change the zone/area.
---
On pservers this is an issue because most of the big ones are PvP only, so you always get people on there who would prefer rolling on PvE. It sometimes seems like they are getting ganked 10times more often than PvP minded players, because they just want to mind their own buisness and follow their quest line.
---
For players who like PvP it is a huge part of how they approach leveling and the game in general. I always think of common traveling routes, opposing quest hubs/towns, my health and surroundings. And I adapt my questing/grinding to the current PvP situation.
---
I haven't played WoW in 12 years, but I did play vanilla as a no-life druid pvper and that's pretty much **exactly** how I remember it.
---
Ranked as a "Natural Shapeshifter/Feral Charge/*Healing*" spec (although I remember Swiftmend as coming vary late in vanilla).
---
Stopped ranking at rank 13 because the Feral Attack Maces from AQ were spoiled/datamined iirc. Got a hold of a AQ20 druid mace, got a little more spell damage and +all stats orientated jewelry, cloak etc. and specced "*Balance*/Feral Charge/Nature's Swiftness".
---
I loved it, was so FUN+good. Except for Shadow Priest, Warlock and Shaman, all other match ups felt even or favored for the druid. Talking about World PvP, where you have perfect freedom to engage and disengage whenever you want.  Basically it was kite+dots.. :) Actually had good enough melee form damage from just the mace+rank/pvp gear and could switch a few pieces for more armor to grind out melees with bearform+hots.
---
I remember warriors, mages and rogues to as being favored match ups, is it still like that or have some new techs changed it? Good PvPers were few and far between back then.
---
I'm gonna do the exact same now when classic comes, but I'll be horde this time, no more orcs to resist my crucial stuns and I even get one more stun..
---
But I like all lore descriptions üò¢
---
Deviate Fish.
---
&gt; It takes like 0 skill and just a little bit of time to get many of the cool looking transmogs from previous expansions. It's funny you mentioned Thunderfury. It took me exactly 1 hour running around old legion dungeons on my rogue to get the Thundefury transmogs.
---
But none of that applies to classic, since there are no previous expansions of trivial content to farm transmogs for. At most you do MC when Naxx is out... 
---
I'm not for transmog in classic, but your argument makes 0 sense. Now if we do eventually get TBC servers, then you've got a point. But we don't know that right now, so we're talking in the context of only having classic. Hence, you actually need to do the content to get those transmogs (if transmog was a thing), there is no way around it.
---
Some people like comparing dick size in town, and they do it by seeing what gear you're wearing.
---
Never said we wouldn't be accepting optimal specs as well... thank you for the input, as well.  
---
Also, I may be an old head (never got to raid in Vanilla, but I was there. Excited to try now) but when did we start saying "meme spec" instead of your spec being "gimped?" Or making you gimped? Gosh it just sounds... stupid.
---
Yes they did and the toggle only changed the character models not the animations.
---
You're absolutely delusional if you don't think June counts a Summer when speaking strictly from a common usage standpoint. No one defines summer based on some specific dates that are obviously not derived from the common understanding of the general population, but instead from some astronomical standard. Summer is generally thought of as the warmest months of the year (June-August), and it also usually coincides with school breaks (the FALL semester usually begins in late Aug/early Sept). So stop running around with this "But summer goes from June 21st to Sept 23rd" bullshit because literally no one thinks of September as part of the generally agreed upon season of "Summer." You're trying to use the very literal astronomic definition of the word, when any normal person (including Blizzard employees) work based on the colloquial definition of the word.
---
Go Warrior
---
Way less people will do it if they risk a permaban
---
&gt; Some talents like Suppression for warlocks say that it reduces the chance for enemies to resist your spells. This just means increases your hit by x%. Again, poor vanilla wording.
---
Yes glad this was mentioned. All spell hit talents are equal to Spell hit% from gear only with a school restriction. It is a common misunderstanding that these talents affect resistances.
---
There is no tree form in vanilla
---
Aside from all the bads commenting about damage spells, there is one case where healers with spell is a non-ironic thing.
---
Boss debufs on players can trigger a 'spell miss' on an attempted cleanse.  I was never able to get a straight answer wether it was Spell Miss or Spell Resistance that was the cause of the very low miss chance.
---
IIRC this mechanic was changed around the time Cata, due to changes to the Dispel-Debuf meta (Dispels got a universal cooldown in exchange for re-thinking debuf design and priority in bosses).
---
So in theory, you need either:  
---
0% hit (resistance based)  
---
3% hit (player level based)  
---
x% hit (mod level based on player level)
---
How is hunter in PvP once people start getting AQ40/Naxx gear? Do they fall behind there as well?
---
I remember starting before oceanic servers, 
---
Playing during the off peak on illidan and khadgar was fun.
---
But Druid has so much meme potential, I‚Äôm afraid I might get bored too quickly
---
I'm tempted to roll on a US server as I kind of fear that Australian servers are gonna be the first to die.  Then again, I hate finding a guild to raid with during Australian times. Sucks that we've got no idea how niche Classic WoW is in Aus, NZ, SEA, etc.
---
No good deed ever goes unpunished !
---
&gt; Do you guys live in very remote rural places
---
Yes, Germany.
---
If ret has a wheelchair, what would a Boomkin be?
---
 Life support?
---
Membership actually existed way before runescape 2
---
I played Horde in vanilla, then switched to Alliance in TBC. That's when I met my future wife.
---
She is now my past wife, and I'm going back to Horde to make sure I don't run into her.
---
This is why using any spell in combat is better than stopping and thinking about the spell in most cases.
---
Your bear is in danger now I got his name
---
I would never buy off a gold seller, wouldn't risk it.
---
I have bought many tokens in retail.
---
I'm betting there are a lot of people out there like me
---
Look i hate Alex just as much as the next guy and love posting his hunter/druid meme video, But lets be real here. Every one that posts Youtube videos does the exact same shit, Hell look at tipsout and Esfand they did 10 min + videos for a Blizzpost that took 15 seconds to read.
---
spicy
---
No July 16th is about 6 week into Summer, if you're using the colloquial definition of Summer that literally every normal person uses, and not some stupid astronomic definition. Summer is generally considered to run from June-August and September marks the transitional period where everyone goes back to school and fall Semesters begin. This is how the majority of normal people in the northern hemisphere define summer, and it's almost certainly the standard by which Blizzard defines it as well. There is absolutely zero chance that Blizzard will release Classic in September and say "Hey guys here's your SUMMER release!"
---
Hahaha holy shit. Chill kid.
---
Assuming everyone has the tactics down I don't see why it wouldn't work.
---
This is what i have come to understand. Guess ill just see what else is out there. Any suggestions?
---
What do you mean "TF transmog"? Are you able to transmog legendaries now in WoW? When I last played in Legion this was not possible.
---
Well - for me it is a classic summer already. The preperation for the release......
---
FCK IT I WANNA PLAY NAOW! GIF!
---
You don't just use Feral Charge as a gap closer. It's also an interrupt/kick that **roots** the target. Pretty much mandatory as an escape tool. Or you can charge an opponent further away to escape a melee on you.
---
You should really take off BoE's from BiS lists.  They are unreasonable and a remnant of Private Server drops.  
---
I am not even sure if our server saw a Belt of the Ordained even drop for example.
---
Agreed, and I hope they add this idea in general just baseline so all servers try finding local opponents first before looking at the other servers to try and resemble what it was like before cross-realm BGs were introduced.
---
Yes and yes.
---
Q2 would be April,May and June so probably mean second half of the year not Q2
---
Imagine drinking energy drinks.
---
Meta: add one more person with this picture replacing its head to represent the memes.
---
It seems you've added an extra letter to Oomkin.
---
Druid is awesome for leveling and you can pwn anyone in world pvp 1v1!
---
me too pls +1
---
I have a vid of me managing 13 somersault jumps on a female nelf, was there for like an hour doing it...
---
They probably just did a blanket change to all the UI elements when the Classic Client was first created (I doubt they'd do it all 1 by 1).   
---
I wouldn't read much into it. There are still quite a few UI elements that haven't been removed, it seems that removing those is not their priority right now. Obviously the client is in a incomplete state.
---
Couldn't you do that with a cool outfit hard to get? For example GW2 legendaries are there just for that.
---
I mean you say that but there is all kinds of cool shit these days from  Crusader Kings 2 to Stardew Valley.
---
Gonna be tough to stretch this one to 10 minutes.
---
The word "meme" pretty much did not exist back in a day.
---
The whole point why people would be willing to take spec like feral is because they could be able to excel at very specific niche applications. 
---
For bear tanks these are certain "pure" mitigation fights and threat. 
---
By pure mitigation I mean resistance-based fights (like Ragnaros tanking) and Patchwerk hateful strike tank, but that's pretty much it. And yes, you do need consumables for that.
---
Regarding threat you need pummelers. And a lot of them. Sorry, but that's how it goes in classic. 
---
If you start cutting corners then you are losing advantages of playing this spec. You go hard or you go home, feral is not a spec for "casual" players, you can learn more about it in [this guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/)
---
There is no evidence by Blizzard or any other source other than anecdotes and guessing that servers capped out at 2500.
---
Given how they're going as far as possible to preserve the game, warts and all, it will probably remain at original server capacity.
---
Dude you've got 1337 in your name, you've got no right to call other people children when you're clearly 12.

Now i want to play cs go again, thanks for that....

The issue is, a lot of secondary stats are stored as spell types which are in a dbc file. Each line in the dbc references a different spell with a different value so for example,  +10 spellpower could be ID 10500 and +11 spellpower could be ID 10511. The SQL table then references these IDs. Also, looking through them, Blizzard devs weren't the most organised back then and there are multiple entries for the same thing, so +30 spellpower would be in there maybe 3 or 4 different times with multiple different IDs. You would need to convert the DBC file to raw text and associate every line with the value (most likely manually) and then concatenate all the ones with the same value into one entry.

I'll assume most people whose lives imploding simply pop the boil with WoW - their problems exist way before WoW and it is simply the catalyst for their final social demise.

Dont get me wrong 
---
Healing as a priest is still fun as hell and a lot harder to do well compared to today 
---
Overall healing was fun because Mana was a big issue and you had to cancel heals to not run out of mana etc. (there was no shadow fiend)
---
Just because you have a certification doesn't mean you're the almighty all knowing god who can absolutely confirm if something is correct is not, i see alot of people tend to do that, i'm a programmer, but i didn't flex about that because i don't claim to know everything, i am just going off of my long time anecdote that generally i have had no issues with using wifi on mmo's.
---
I've literally played off of shitty wifi adapters which were mostly $20 and below with absolutely no issues for years on world of warcraft and runescape, when you're playing a fps, sure it matters, because generally there will be more latency from and to your router, and it matters down to the milliseconds, this isn't the case with mmo's, yes if you can use ethernet it is much better, but wifi will also work fine assuming your adapter or router isn't fucked up.
---
Also, define inconsistent, you're being vague, do you mean inconsistent as in constant disconnects, lost data, packet drops, etc? TCP is generally pretty good at handling lost data and most games use the protocol anyways, so as long as it is not dropping packets out the ass it really should not be an issue.
---
For me it depended on raid times.  I can only raid on certain days so finding a guild with my level of interest in raiding on the days I can raid is important.  If I roll on a random server it is possible, even likely, that there will not be a good match for days/hours of raid time.  If all days were equal then I would probably have just waited until launch and joined one as I neared max level since I would have had much more flexibility.
---
I don't see why they can't include a toggle for new textures/models. Like, the games running current code. They could swap in the models for just about every creature without breaking the game. It would be nice to let players choose. As long as it's an option, no harm no foul.
---
Agreed. This is a multiplayer game where everyone should really be on the same level. I don‚Äôt care for a toggle constantly hanging over my head reminding me that the new models are a click away. It‚Äôs different art design, not improved like the textures are. 
---
Some people like the new models, I like some of the new models, but I don‚Äôt want an option constantly hanging over my head to switch the the new models if I ever get sick of the old ones. I don‚Äôt want the temptation to ruin immersion and nostalgia. I think that‚Äôs a lot more important than some stupid new models. I don‚Äôt want people experiencing a different version of vanilla than what we all remember. 
---
Yes it‚Äôs selfish, and it‚Äôs what I want. It‚Äôs what we will fight about, but apparently we are the few that accept that while there are improvements in modern WoW, we stand by Blizzards unwavering stance on purity for the old game. Nothing changed. You don‚Äôt see people playing old runescape with runescape 3 models for a reason. It puts the player base on different levels and if you allow too much difference client side people start playing different games. 
---
I don‚Äôt want that. I don‚Äôt want blizzard to start relaxing their unaltered stance because some people don‚Äôt like some specifics of vanilla. I don‚Äôt give a fuck if it‚Äôs client side only, don‚Äôt give people the option to play a different game than the one we asked for. 
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of vanilla WoW. We were all experiencing the same things. No ones amount of money out them at a higher advantage, no one was seeing anything different than other players. Keep it the same. 
---
You were all nazis about purity until this post then everyone here decided to regress back into the ‚Äúsingle player game - play how I want,‚Äù mindset of modern WoW. 
---
Keep it pure.
---
I just wanna grap all the ppl asking what to play and yell at them "IF YOU NEED OTHERS TO TELL YOU WHAT TO PLAY YOU GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME"
---
Read the description of each class and whatever class speaks to you the most, roll it.
---
The only classes i can understand is difficult to seperate is warlock and mage but even then its pretty clear how different the two classes are apart from spell casters.
---
Then it's Priest or Shaman for you.

I think it's very puzzling that people have been hellbent on the "#nochanges" thing, and yet they want to completely change the feel of the game by altering the server population and spawn rates. Maybe those people would be better off sticking to private servers?

I'm personally looking to experience the game as close to original as possible.

There are still people who think they should. There's quite a few talents that are flat out bugged or have misleading tooltips. And it would be nice to see a balance pass to make certain classes a little more viable.
---
That tree is awesome man, I'm gonna miss it. Ye tree. Form. Was added in tbc.
---
and classic should be easier on the hardware i think. rocking 2500u also.
---
You‚Äôre extremely myopic. You‚Äôre literally demanding they start implementing features of retail into Classic after we‚Äôve begged for unwavering purity of the old game. You want blizzard to start relaxing their stance on something YOU don‚Äôt think matters but is the whole reason why the game is not what it used to be. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a buffet, you dont get to pick and choose what parts of vanilla you want. This is vanilla. Take it as is or go play BfA.
---
I have explained my reasoning. Everyone is accounted for. It's pointless though. We'll see.
---
If you have the time simply get one of each class to level 10, park him/her in a resting spot go to next character and just level them with reset exp bonus!
---
That is until you find the class that you enjoy then focus on that one.  Me personally I already know I want to level a rogue on a PvP server.  I did a shaman pvp and mage pve back in the day I want something new to experience this feeling.
---
I'm going to make a druid for nostalgia - I was a feral throughout vanilla, and now I know it's going to have the proper animation for stealth, that sealed the deal.  I'm also going to make a mage, because for a variety of reasons I'm a crap player, and mage is one of the easier ones to play adequately.  No class is easy to play well, but some are more easy to be adequate.
---
I used to play 14/32/5 most of the time after the feral revamp, with the occasional attempt at 1/29/21. Maybe it was the gear (I only had access to the rank 10 set and The Unstoppable Force), but the hybrid spec damage was so pathetic that I could rarely kill anyone before their friends would arrive. Mana was also a huge issue, I'd run OOM from shifting especially against highly geared warriors and rogues.
---
Not sure what I should play in classic. I've got a premade, so 8/11/32 is an obvious choice, but I'd probably miss the feral action. No idea if I'll ever get the FAP mace from AQ or the epic PvP set (the 3 piece bonus is arguably mandatory). Maybe I should go the easy route and play something like hunter or mage.

Path of exile is pretty great game to spend some time on until classic if you are into arpgs like diablo. There is a shop but it's 100% purely cosmetic
---
With black lotus having 1h cooldowns again I doubt you'll see many fully flasked raids. If you want to be really good as a feral (you mentioned MCP) then you'll need a lot of consumes. The most essential for progress are the ones that keep you alive, especially as a melee. So the various protection potions and health buffs are really nice. Annoyingly enough you can't drink pots while shapeshifted, I have a vague memory of bring able to use healthstones while shapeshifted but I'm not entirely sure.
---
Whether or not they should be more inclusive wasn't the comment. I said more clarity is a good thing. It was surrounding you genuinely acting like it could be a southern hemisphere release, which would never be a real consideration unless you were a complete moron.

How about **40 priests**? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0

Multiple accounts probably. And/or botting as you mentioned.

..how did you not know?
---
I've always assumed Blizzard would throw in the tokens. Not at launch, they're not idiots. But during phase 2 or 3, absolutely. Same with the TCG game loot that was available during Vanilla. Everyone's gonna have a swim speed turtle for a nominal fee of $25.
---
It solves a problem Blizzard doesn't want to deal with and it makes them money. It takes time, money, and resources to detect gold sellers and to take action against them. They need to pay people to manually review accounts accused of buying, and as soon as you make a method to catch bots they adapt. You don't have to worry about that if you push them out of the market. And they make that money instead.
---
It's going to feel really shitty when they do it, but it's gonna happen.
---
The downvotes you're getting lol
---
Lmao Clearly.
---
100% boomkin, trust me I played vanilla.
---
This is a brilliant Idea.  I remember when we were progressing towards Rags and into BWL, our hunter team went out and farmed the black dragonkin, to be able to craft the blackdragonskin LWing patterns for all 4-5 hunters in the guild.  We'd Farm the elementals in Arathi as a team.  Same with bloodvine, we'd farm ZG to get this in groups (druids/rogues &amp; hunters). 
---
Farming in groups makes it easy. especially if your are also helping folk with rep grinds to get good enchants/recipes too.  it doesnt take as long if more folk are working to help their team out.

Stat weighting is known.  It is a logrithmic cap based on ilvl and item slot.  Each stat contribution is non-linear in that a 5-stat item will have more total power than a 4-stat item.  This was designed so that 1-stat items (eg: 100% str) were not better than multistat items (eg: 50% STR, 50% Stam).

Same for me. Wow killed gaming for me. Nothing ever lived up to the experience after my addiction up to Cata, and then I wasn't able to get hooked onto another game since.
---
I still play games, but I can't sink hundreds of hours into them anymore, regardless of how much time I have to play.
---
I would say Mage. You don't have to work as hard as others to farm gold because you can aoe farm dungeons. Your PvE rotation consists of macroing all of your cooldowns into a button and then spamming frostbolt. If you run out of mana there's a lot of ways to get it back. Your biggest responsibility might be to keep something polymorphed for a few minutes, max.
---
You don't need to respec a lot as a mage and it's easy to make gold so it doesn't hurt as badly when you do.

Maybe I misunderstood you or you misunderstood the thing about sharding. Sharding is there to only help launch, overpopulation of starting zones. It won't be there forever. Population capacity has not been confirmed yet. If u play on realm A u can't play with friend with character on realm B.
---

My macbook pro 15‚Äù from 2012 can run the current retail client at 1080p/60fps. A used one nowadays goes for under ¬£500, make sure you get one with a deciated graphics card (Gtx750 etc).
---
I'd say the game begins at level 1. Though I know many in team private server have done the leveling so many times that they just want to get it over with. I'm also a bit like that, but I do want to take my time with my main. Then probably boost an alt up very quick at some point in the future. 
---
You can also pretty much raidlog until maybe late AQ/Naxx so in that sense it's not a very big timesink. It's more in AQ/Naxx where you need a ton of consumes on top of also raiding BWL, AQ40, Naxx and maybe a ZG/AQ20/Ony. 
---
Ranking is the biggest timesink though. If you're aiming for rank 10+ you have to invest an insane amount of time into the game.
---
Troll priest best pvp spriest.
---
The player cap was lower back then, cos this was what the servers could handle. Dont think that'll be an issue now. The main issue for sharding is to prevent too many players all in the same area, looking for the same items and mobs as everyone else.  There are many starting areas, but if everyone starts on the same day/same time, then it'd be chaos. You'd struggle to see the quest mob to hand in a quest. 
---
As players level and move out, play on different times etc....the need for sharding is alleviated. Even if there are 10K players still playing, its split between horde/alliance, and then split further by the different level ranges, and split even further to the different levels and different maps players are in. 
---
Regarding checking the demand? How do they do this? I've not played since 2012, I know about 4-5 folk I played with back in Vanilla are all coming back, yet none are on here.  If the servers are massively over populated, then they'll release more servers. But I guess they want to prevent very low populated servers too.
---
That's a stretch. Mage is probably the best PvP class in classic. High skill ceiling, good in most scenarios (casual BGs, premades, duels, world PvP), much, MUCH better with bad gear than locks, beats rogues and warriors pretty handily which are going to be among the most played classes, very decent matchup spread in general.
---
comparing a current 300 dollar laptop to 2004 hardware is laughable
---
I'm in the same spot. Knowing that AQ40 and Naxxramas will take at least solid 3h of playing non-stop at fixed time really makes me question if I want to start playing Classic.
---
They can still have a pop cap and queue when sharding is enabled
---
If classic runs like most vanilla pservers, then any laptop with intel graphics can run it. My surface pro 4 core m3, which is a fanless tablet, and it dosnt get hot.... I dont think people will have problems running classic
---
How much worse is shadow priest dps compared to mage/warlock in raids.
---
I'm going to spend 55 levels wearing just about any old crap I can find, I'm then going to head to Timbermaw hold, kiss as many asses as I can, get the recipes for Warbear Woolies, and then hang out in my furry undies alongside the pool with diving board in Stranglethorn Vale.

Transmog ruins my immersion. Why would a level 5 warrior that has never fought anything stronger than a kobold be wearing this amazing armor and wield the Ashbringer? It makes no sense, this person is a nobody, and his equipment should reflect that. I should be able to tell how powerful your character is by the way you look. This is especially important in PvP, where you should pick your fights based on how geared the enemy looks. You cannot see other people's health in vanilla, so there is no other way to judge their strength.
---
is there a priest pvp bis list somewhere?
---
aside from rogue I can't find anything related to pvp bis list for any classes
---
Like half?
---
Well that's interesting. I guess they're banking on sharding to deal with the initial over-population
---
warrior or mage? more like -&gt; what can i solo farm elites with and care to play. right now its bm hunter, prot warrior or maybe some kind of druid?
---
Looks like a solid deal, thank you!
---
I can't give you any specific answers, but server population (census) addons ask you to send in the data you collect. If AH addons do the same, you can create a larger database. Of course, if you want to create this database, you might have to also be the one to create the AH addon that collects the data (and converts it into a file people easily can send).
---
I did that during vanilla and had a horrible time, I thought druid sounded like the coolest thing ever, but ended up hating it because feral was a sack of fat garbage for about 3/4ths of vanillas lifespan, and even afterword it was pretty frowned upon so you had to heal in most guilds.
---
Agree but the majority of this subreddit doesnt so downvotes are coming
---
Warriors &gt; mages and that is facts
---
Added amigo! Look forward to some adventures!
---
Sharing in the beginning zones is more MMO like than grouping with 5 people constantly for the first 5-10 levels. After that, I agree there shouldn‚Äôt be sharding
---
More players is more fun though imo.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt think about getting another older macbook, good idea!
---
I am rolling Horde this go around even though I hate all the Horde cities, so I'll just roll an undead rogue and hang out in the Alliance cities instead. :D
---
Actually considering priest again after being set on Warrior cuz I liked tanking. Healing is also fun, plus I reckon priests are more 'chill' when it comes to things outside organized raiding. 
---
What are your thoughts on Alliance vs Horde? At the moment I'm leaning towards Troll Priest personally.
---
Honestly what I am thinking tbh. My gut says classic wow is niche in Australia and NZ but hell I might be wrong.

It‚Äôs not too bad as long as the fight is under 90 seconds long and you can take up 3 debuff slots and no one else has better than T1 gear.

Boomkin is fine in casual raiding guilds. Its not good if you play in a serieus raiding guild.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. I should mention this is a 2018 model and I‚Äôve owned it new since July 2018. It‚Äôs specs are still very current but it obviously isn‚Äôt as good value as it was back then. However it still represents good value.
---
It plays vanilla and BFA very well. I have all my settings up.
---
50-100 People in one quest Zone is perfect I agree!
---
But at release - when there is ~3000 Player on each Server trying to get it - there will be more than 50-100 Players per starting Zone - hence - sharding for the starting Zone.
---
I'm going to recreate my first experience in WoW but not be a noob and do it right. THEN I'll try classes I didn't play in Vanilla.
---
I 100% want to join that guild, pls remind me
---

---
As mentioned many times in this thread, it is BiS (or top two, usually BiS) upgrade for Hunters. You wouldn't deny a warrior a BiS item for other classes that want to use that item for PvP purposes, would you? Then you don't for Hunters either. Anything that increases the raids performance in a raid should be prioritized. The additional DPS gained by the Hunters having this BiS item gives them priority over warriors or ret paladins for this item.
---
Back in the old days, I would venture a guess that most hunters didn't know about weaving in melee attacks inbetween their auto shot rotation. This new knowledge only further increases the value of Ashkandi for Hunters.
---
Do you think it's impossible to have fun doing things fast?

worth no, bringing another mage will be more overall dps. Will a casual guild allow a boomkin, yeah maybe.
---
This actually made me chuckle, +1
---
It‚Äôs niche for sure, there will be a lot of tourists initially but the surge will die off. I guess we can always transfer characters to a US realm if it dies off.
---
Like the other commenter said, shadow priests are a significant decrease in damage compared to the pure damage classes. It's low enough that progression guilds will only take a single shadow priest and that's mostly for the debuff that increases the warlock damage. The other thing working against shadow priests is that holy priests are pretty much always around in raids, so shadow doesn't bring any additional utility besides Vampiric Embrace and that isn't all that strong.
---
50-100 people in the same zone is ok, great even. Sharding is *potentially* being used to prevent 2000 people all surrounding the Northshire Abbey, trying to share the ~50 level 1 boars that spawn there.
---
eh, It's easier to get your Dartol's Rod of Transformation and get a nice, furry ass for yourself.
---
Yeah I unsubbed because retail was too easy. (5/9 LFR btw)
---
Right but ***neither*** are optional in classic.
---
In WoW when sharding was introduced i never saw anyone in the world, maybe 1-2 people in a span of HOUR, it felt like i was playing a single player game.

Pretty sure it was a design and not server limits.

---
I have seen videos of hunters coming in top 10 in Naxx. That's pretty good. The top dps are always warrior, mage and rogue. The next best seems to be Hunters and Warlocks.
---
Because up till now they were very "nochanges" (not counting the things which they do for lowering costs and integrating the game into their architecture), I really hope they'll keep the Vanilla 2.5-3K server cap.
---
But still, even with 3000 people in the 6 starting zones, that's 500 people per zone. With sharding that can be lowered to, say, 100 per zone. Which is still very crowded but playable. There will be no sharding in higher level zones and after a while even in the starting zones it can be turned off.

It would be better to decease the respawn time for mobs in starter zones for the first few days/weeks. Get the vast bulk of players out into the rest of the map then bring it back to normal when it‚Äôs at a decent pace

Holy priest I understans. However, is shaman really that sought after?
---
afaik classic will have option to use vanilla graphics or updated retail graphics which is more demanding
---
Something about Frost‚Äôs accent/manner of speaking make his videos soothing. He also provides genuinely useful information and easy to digest lore facts. 
---
Hope he keeps it up that way and channel becomes B I G in classic
---
Like world pvp on retail is difrent now. As soon as more than 20 players get involved the servers lag lile hell
---
Alliance side, dwarf is just too op. Even if I prefer the human animation and overall look, stone-skin is a life saver in PvP against rogue and fear ward is really useful in both PvE and PvP + that chest tracker is always a little plus I really enjoy.
---
On Horde side, Troll is very strong and even more with blackout talent but I just can't stand their physics and would rather roll undead
---
Vanila boss mechanics are simple and usually only affect one or two players.
---
Like every 20 secs a player must do something while the rest just keep going at it.
---
Most bosses can be explained in 2 sentences. I know because I've recently started raiding and thats how much info I got and it was completely fine.
---
But it does not mean the bosses are necessarily easy: A tank and spank fight can be really hard if the core combat is hard. On the other hand mana and threat management isn't that complicated as people make it out to be.
---
Priests are pretty good at leveling tho, just get a wand and that sweet, sweet wand spec
---
Classic WoW is huge, it has immense content, questlines that take months if you want, it has progression, it has variety, it has companionship, it has involvement - I cannot think of any other game that offered as much as the original WoW did, and I would bet one of my testicles that if it were to be released now, it would be released in parts, it's so much bigger than anything else that has come since.
---
You could play the game in so many different ways, you could take your own paths in a nearly completely open world, it allowed your imagination to run riot, the stories, the lore, everything was so well thought out.
---
It could not be made the same if it were new now - the powers that be would insist that much content be broken up into smaller packages that could be sold in increments, it's probably a one off that will never be matched again.
---
I agree but why shit on world first guilds? Being good at the game and doing what's necessary to compete at that level doesn't make you an elitist.
---
I think your last point is kinda poor, I care WAY more about the way my character looks than the way other peoples character looks, taking away someone elses ability to tailor their character the way they would like so that they are forced to see your character the way you like seems kinda shitty.
---
Mage is vastly better, objectively. The pserver population proved it. Best in PvP with godlike mobility (although locks are not bad either, they just don't equate), best caster in PvE raids, making food and mana is a godsend, portals are a godsend. Lock is a tidbit easier to level because of the pet, but again, pservers have proven that mages are on par.
---
True true! Wars aren‚Äôt bad either if you get a good 2h every 10 lvls or so
---
If I remember correctly the addon automated the targting of a curced player. This will not come back.
---
But with inproved raid frames or a raid frame addon it should be clear enough who to dispell.
---
If you're playing any kind of balance spec you don't want to get close to the target, ever. A 4 second interrupt is not worth getting feared/nova'd/frostshock/gouged or whatever else that can hit you within a 30 yard range. This is the exact reason you see people play specs like 29/11/11 and then go into discord crying about how warlocks are the hardest class to beat when they actually aren't. They don't understand basic mechanics.
---
Might want to add "burst of knowledge" and maybe a third trinket slot, for those 1 fightr cooldown trinkets, that u swap oiut?
---
You don't understand BiS, do you?
---
BiS shows you the best available Item for that Slot. Not what's realistically available.
---
I did a list of easily accessible items for raiding myself. Feel free to make your own lists.
---
I would say that looking around for guilds already is not a bad idea, see if you find someone that match you in terms of timezone, raidtimes, level of "hardcoreness", ideals, goals, etc.  
---
Then the other tip I would give you is that the odds of guilds disbanding before classic creatly depends on the "origin" of the guild.
---
If you have a group of people that just now came together on a discord server, but only like the 3-4 officers have really played together before, then the odds of everyone sticking with it is lower. Since there's no real sense of comraderie yet, no "brand loyalty" no sense of "us against the world".  
---
But there are guilds that have been active on the private server scene for years, going from server to server when they die out and pop up new. Those guilds will have built up a solid core of 30ish or so players that already have that cohesive sense of unity about them. And if you find that their way of being and way of thinking about classic suits you then I would say the odds of that guild sticking around til it comes out is higher.
---
Why not save your DKP for something of higher priority, like the crossbow from Chromaggus? Or did you already have it?
---
7 silver?!?!? That‚Äôs.. hmm.. that‚Äôs almost a whopping 700 COPPER! Now that‚Äôs an appropriate bounty if I‚Äôve ever seen one!
---
Because world first was done 15 years ago.
---
Millions of dps Warriors. It is the #1 picked class/spec. I'm sure we will do just fine replacing greedy fury warriors.
---
Are you looking for healing or Spriest bis gear?
---
For Spriest the PvP set is pretty strong, for the off-set piece you can look for a warlock PvP BiS list, there should be more than for Priest.
---
I'd recommend checking this site  [http://www.vanilla-info.com/priest](http://www.vanilla-info.com/priest)
---
Not quite true. T3 geared Warlock is a monster, Mage is quite good, but other classes catch it once you get to Naxx gear.
---
How so? Devouring plague always looks good on paper, but I've not played either.
---
If the Classic demo is anything to go by, that also felt like a freaking ghost town.
---
Blizzcon 2017
---
oops, meant healing!
---
thx for the link mate
---
Yeah, like they were sponsored at that time, Method didn't even exist in Vanilla.
---
You can't just tell us how much time OSRS takes and claim that Classic WoW isn't a timesink. How long does it take to reach max level in Elder Scrolls Online? FF XIV? Guild Wars 2? Maplestory 2? I don't actually know, maybe they all require more time than Classic and it actually is "one of the less grindy mmorpgs nowadays". But your argument is akin to going to a McDonalds and then an In 'n Out, and then claiming that In 'n Out has THE BEST burgers in town. Give us more data.
---
I'd never flame but I'll add a few quick thoughts on your comment.
---
&gt;\- Healers
---
You had to downrank, sure, but that's about it. Healing is, imo, much more difficult in retail. 
---
I only played Uldir before I unsubbed but mana management was just as much of a big deal in Uldir as in vanilla. 
---
&gt;\- Then there's the class mastering in vanilla &gt;that you just don't have in retail. The classes and &gt;specs in retail have been cut down to where &gt;there is no "useless" spells anymore, and there &gt;is hardly any (not saying there is non) room for &gt;error on "how you should be" playing your class.
---
"Most" specs spam 1-2 spells in vanilla. You have cookiecutter builds for every situation (same in retail). You might not have useless spells in retail, but having useless spells doesnt make it harder, just don't use them.
---
&gt; Managing resources, mana, rage, threath, &gt;consumables = harder.
---
If it's your first few times, sure.
---
The only thing that makes vanilla raids in any way harder than retail raids is the number of people required, imo. They're just two different games.
---
Add ons were in vanilla stop fucking posting this shit.
---
Yes 100%, trust me I played vanilla.
---
So sad. So so s4d.
---
Moonfire spam!
---
All 4 of em!
---
It's the impatience and desperation that is pathetic, yes. I would have expected better of people who are most likely older. Instead its constant posting begging for a release date and completely unrealistic expectations. 
---
It's just my opinion that any reasonable person would just accept it's probably coming out in July or August and deal with it, instead of pathetically hoping it will come out at the earliest possible time and getting sad when it doesn't.
---
More players shrinks the world, not adds to it.
---
You'll be less likely to run across the same players at any given time - reducing potential interaction and increasing bad behavior, economies will be WILDLY different, zone mob spawns will be on lock, etc.
---
It's a negative.
---
orc warrior, hunter or shaman.... can't decide
---
Because it is. It's quite literally Best in Slot for hunters. It is an offspec item for warriors, and also Best In Slot for ret paladins.
---
Priority is: Hunter &gt; Ret Paladins &gt; Warriors. That's right, a ret paladin who you would never invite, gets higher priority on this weapon over a warrior. Why? Because it's Best in Slot for them, and NOT the warrior.
---
They're bored. Big deal
---
does no one remember felix‚Äôs tools quest in the gnome/dwarf starting area? having 50-100+ standing around waiting to click one item with a 3 minute timer sounds fucking terrible.
---
Should the first Lok'amir il Romathis go to the shadow priest, balance druid or elem sham of your raid?
---
It‚Äôs going to be in starting zones and only first few weeks. Otherwise you‚Äôd be back on this thread crying like a little bitch that you can‚Äôt find 10 kobolds. Shut the fuck up.
---
great job hanging out Jangdor like that :( you forgot one blue line!
---
I‚Äôm not sure he was shitting on world first guilds, just saying that not every guild/group needs to emulate their strategies to beat the raid. You can definitely beat MC without everyone being optimal classes/gear/consumables.
---
That‚Äôs the thing I love about these off spec players.
---
Playing pve raiding ret, enhance, spriest, feral, moonkin, ele is NOT for casual folks. 
---
You are handicapping your raid regardless, so the expectation should be you put in MORE effort than someone who is actually suited to the role.
---
Horde raids will bring 8 Shamans if they can find that many.
---
and a depressing 0.07 Gold :(
---
Why and which spec?
---
What if they added the WoW Token?
---
Well said. I also thought priest would fit but then I hated playing it and switched to warrior and had a blast.
---
Without knowing too much they provide good fire ress gear such as black dragon scale set
---
You stack honor into brackets so everyone gets close to the same RP. You can and likely will have weeks with a handful of bracket 1 premade players hitting 14 on reset. The bracket sizes are limited by the number of active CHARACTERS on the server with 15+ Honor Kills. You are likely to see experienced players trading kills on alts to bump these numbers up artificially as well since blizzard isn't going to go out of their way to stop people abusing a game mechanic like private servers have in the past.
---
I used Decursive in Vanilla, one of the few addons I used back then.
---
No idea why you got downvoted but yeah, good luck getting that shit.
---
Hey at least you made your own experience with the class, Classic isnt a 2 year only period this time so plenty of time to find a new favorite class.
---
This would've been a great pun for a healing spec.
---
People look at these types of players like they‚Äôre Jesus and use them as examples as to perpetuate the misinformation that you have to play their way and that it‚Äôs the only way to play. That if you aren‚Äôt playing their way, then you won‚Äôt be able to down raid bosses.
---
Devouring plague cost a lot of mana, trolls can proc blackout with shadowguard, i dont know what is better but i personally prefer sp troll.
---
Totems. Restoration.

In March 2014 Blizzard announced a presale for Warlords of Draenor with the follwing quote: "Warlords of Draenor launches worldwide this fall ...". On the shopping page Blizzard specified this to "Warlords of Draenor is expected to release on or before 12/20/2014".

When they say Summer they mean June 21 - Sept 23.
---
Yes, but the thibg is its not like retail, itns only for first few eeks and only starting zones so it w/e, youll have plenty time fighting for mobs in all other zones
---
Yes, just make sure to find a non-minmaxer casual guild and enjoy.
---
It will require more from your pc than the vanilla pservers, because its on 7.3.5 client.
---
I played holy/discipline priest in both pvp and pve all my wow career and let me tell you, op, if I can dop it so can you.
---
I started with no binds, keyboard turning, spending half into shadow and trying to dps as a healer in dungeons and wondering why my mana disappears so quickly. 
---
Is it tough? Yeah. Is it impossible? Absolutely not!
---
The reward of gratitude is wholesome, the ability to find groups easily is great, and even when it's a thankless task *you* will know that it was due to your efforts that crazy warrior in WSG is sitting at 55 killing blows and  deaths.
---
Don't let the complexity discourage you, it's worth it if you enjoy the process. Skill and aptitude come from experience and you will have that in time.
---
But that doesn't mean people trying to optimize their rooster are cuckholds.
---
And?
---
They are not exactly the pc gaming heroes of late.
---
Trust me, I know how to spot a cuckold. They are cuckolds.
---
Tailoring got bloodvine at ZG phase which is really good, also truefaith chest BiS.
---
Blacksmith armor got FR which is really good but not really neccessary, but you got Lionheart BiS drop from MC and later at AQ phase you got Titanic leggings BiS, drop from Dragon bosses.
---
raiddrops recepies, that are BoE only. But no prebis BoP like tailoring has.
---
Mhmm and blizzard is?
---
Not quite because tailoring has the class robes and later the Bloodvine set. Leatherworking and blacksmithing don't have anything comparable, everything important from those is BoE.
---
As long as the Boomkin has mana, it's okayish. Once the Boomkin goes out of mana (or throttles DPS output to conserve mana) it's really bad. 
---
There is no good gameplay justification for bringing one in your raid as Boomkins will mostly take Mage gear anyway while beeing inferior in every way. But if you have social connections or the raid doesn't take the raiding too seriously, you can get in.
---
Except all the healing specs are viable. 
---
How *I*ch*RONIC*.
---
Oh not at all, I hate launcher exclusivity. As far as i'm concerned even blizzard games should exist on steam.
---
It might not have been banned, but some mechanism it used may have been removed, so it could have just broken, the end result is basically the same though.
---
100 people in starting zones will make the game un-enjoyable. You won‚Äôt actually get to play the game actually.
---
Sharding is just for the server stability and queue times at launch, and only in the starter zones, so I don't mind. You'd prefer to spent some time in a queue at launch?
---
Better be I'm really looking forward to playing classic with low latency I experienced it originally on 33kbps dial-up can't remember the ping time was but it was baad.
---
I would of course keep different kits of gear depending on the role I'm currently doing.
---
just one monitor - newb
---
it was changed the way decurse worked. Before you could spam it and it decursed everything close to you (we used a macro and spammed it)  
---
But then they changed it to target decurse.
---
Way less. Shadow priest DPS is legitimately awful. It's worth bringing one if you have at least four warlocks in the raid, but these days a lot of the competitive guilds just get one of the healing priests to spec into the shadow damage debuff so they don't need to bring a shadow priest.
---
Was actually just talking about this with a friend. I'm guessing character transfers will be available because they were technically in vanilla also. Hopefully the Aus community isn't DOA though.

If you come into vanilla raiding with a retail raider mentality you will find it hard.
---
And if you come into retail raiding with a vanilla raider mentality you will find it hard.
---
They are both hard, just in very different ways, since tbh, they are two very different games.
---
It's not very unrealistic to think a game is released during a summer month when it's release date was summer. Get over your self, Mr. Cool Guy.
---
You're client is saying you have 2 M**B**ps

Big B is Mega-Bytes

Little b is mega-bits

Significant difference. Unless they capitalized the B by mistake in the client you are getting ~16 Mbps download. Pretty nutty connection if this is from 2005.
---
Just speaking from my experience on private servers :)
---
Tipsout did a T3 damage comparison and this is the point where mage is furthest ahead of the pack, due to fire spec and crit stacking becoming overwhelming. 
---
He's also done MC and BWL versions (no AQ one that I can find), and T3 is by far the point where mage is furthest ahead. Warrior is #1 in both T1 and T2 content.

Good bot!

Why would you want to do other stuff when you're playing classic!
---
I think June was a bit optimistic anyhow.
---
Classic will NOT run like vanilla private servers. Classic will use current retail engine.
---
Tri Spec is great, but becomes much more viable with some gear. No particular reason to level like that, especially considering the lack of spirit tap. I'd go 5/5 wand specialization -&gt; shadow for leveling and respec at 60. You can go trispec with bad gear, it's just not as good as it could be - but I wouldn't level like this.
---
Play Druid and do both!
---
It's less about you wanting to get close to your opponents and more about the numerous ways your opponents will inevitably get close to you.

Perhaps it is trivial content but I remember the first 2 bosses of Blackwing lair being on another level until we perfected the execution.

Nefarian was on another challenge too and finally Naxx was brutal and beyond challenging. Molten core was a chore early on mainly because how unturned it was and how was wasn't optimal but then it got easy

Wrong. See my answer here: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk0u4h/classic_wow_reconfirmed_summer_release/#eme9l9u
---
You defined the concepts that stem off of depth and now I'm thinking about plant analogies. A deep game is growing your own food in fertile soil: it takes some work and patience but the rewards are immense, diverse, and interesting. Modern AAA is buying plastic-wrapped burritos at the gas station: we know what it will taste like, it takes no effort, and we will probably get tired of it pretty quick.
---
Dynamic respawns is farther from the vanilla feel than 1-2 weeks of sharding will ever be.
---
You can do fedex quests or get exploration xp if you are not comfortable with competition. Too many people forget this.
---
r/wowclassiccirclejerk
---
It's not actually for the server stability or queue times, those are just a nice added benefit. The goal is to prevent dead servers after the looky-loos leave.
---
Although it is annoying having to install a billion different launchers it is good for competition. If steam were the only place to buy games online, the games would be more expensive and developers would get less money from Valve per game sold.

---
If you want a significant amount more GPU power (2x+) for a little more. Slightly better CPU as well.
---
So how did they handle events like the AQ gates opening? Everyone on the server would want to be online at once.
---
Just pick whatever the fuck you like. Every class has it's advantages.
---
Blizzard explicitly removed functionality from it, similar to how they removed the ability to use custom nameplates (during instanced content) in 7.3.5
---
Just accept it no ones listening
---
My man
---
&gt; Server side I never bought in on their story of "what a surprise we just found the old database right at the time of a very big petition and the Nost debacle.
---
What exactly do you not believe? The whole movement made them reconsider their stance so they were looking if they can find some backups. Which they did, luckily. Atno point did they claim it was coincidential timing.   
---
And no, being a publicly traded corporation does not mean they are "legally obliged to save everything". I am not even sure what you mean with that sentence and I would be surprised if you could give a sensible explanation.
---
the obvious answer is ret pally
---
Nothing like getting gear upgrades from things you can queue for and finish in 15 minutes. I subbed for a month right around 8.1.5 release, ran normal Dazar'alor a few times, got some upgrades that felt good to get. Then I got a weapon 15 ilvls higher from a titanforge for turning something in related to warfronts. There's no middle ground anymore. Players either sit at a 'casual' ilvl and consistently get upgrades from easy stuff that are as good or better than heroic raids, or they sit at the higher-tier of pushing high mythic+ and mythic raiding (both things I can't find any pleasure in dedicating my time to). 
---
BFA sucks ass.
---
or mindcontrol
---
you forgot the guy way in the back thinking ‚Äúret pally looks interesting‚Äù
---
5-6% for yellow hits to always hit these are ability damage, white is auto attacks
---
please do. couldn't find your guide on the discord (maybe another discord? i am on Zephan's)
---
This. BiS doesn't mean reasonably obtainable, lol. It means the mathematically strongest.
---
I'd form relationships in the game
---
Yeah they were, but more to alleviate over populated servers. I‚Äôm guessing they might exist to satisfy the inverse on classic. 
---
Or... in a perfect world classic will draw in some retail players who want the old game back and the community will thrive. 
---
I want to play pve server too, so hopefully there is enough to sustain that, pvp seems to be more popular in terms of server type.
---
What server type are you planning on?
---
You forgot all the idiots coming in with their "better builds"

---
This is allready posted, just a couple of hours ago...
---
you are the delusional one.
---
I'm undecided between playing prot warrior as an offtank in raids or just doing dps fury warrior. I really want to tank but I'm worried I won't be able to get raid spots due to lack of demand. Right now I'm in a guild where it's mostly dependent on which player gets geared/attunement first for first progression ony/mc run.
---
ilevel has almost nothing to do with the power of the item. An addon that attempts to weight gear would never work. All it would achieve is to make a bunch of morons decline players for dungeons based on ignorance.
---
my bad, I missed it
---
Along with your opinion backed with no evidence.
---
Dwarf Priest it is then.
---
I really hope they do not remove it.
---
When the addon got removed, the raid encounters were also designed differently. Generally TBC+ raid design would shift magic debuffs to be occuring less often and on fewer players, but the debuffs themselves would be more powerful.
---
Vanilla just have bosses spam curses on 40 players over and over and over every 10 seconds. Without decursive it will be a complete nightmare trying to deal with it.
---
I am certain they will have Oceanic Servers from the start. The already have all the infrastructure in place. They had oceanic realms as far back as TBC.
---
5% against a same level character, you need about 1% per level higher than yours to reach the cap. (63 raid boss = 8%)
---
There is such advanced guides on this Topic on YouTube, reddit - hell there probably is a book published just regarding this Topic. 
---
Please use the search function :)
---
Thx and GL
---
5000 people in a starting zone doesn't simulate the vanilla experience. for almost anyone.
---
Maybe one per raid. No more, maybe less.
---
There are also a few instant lvl 60 private servers around.
---
Vanilla isn't so hard that you cannot have 1 deadweight in the raid, but why would you? And it is hard enough that you cannot have 40 deadweights in the raid, so who's doing the carrying and why should they?

Max buffs. Elixirs, flasks, Ony buff and food
---
It's a lot easier when you can buy gear for your alt.
---
Oh I see! So the goal is to create a talent spec that you don't have to bother respeccing every time you want to switch role?  
---
Could work. You'll miss out on opportunities to maximize the potential of either role but if you can do 90% of both roles by gear swap, then I can see that working.  
---
What supporting professions would you go?
---
Feral isnt really a memespec though. It's a highly competitive and optimal spec assuming the Feral knows what he/she's doing.
---
Didn't they already say there was an option for classic?
---
Im naming my character Talor
---
Jk
---
Seconded, am doing the same
---
Well, they didn't handle it.  Those events were spectacular failures of hardware.  The 2500 cap was usually spread out over 3 pieces of hardware (Kalimdor, EK, and instances each their own server blade) and across dozens of zones.  During AQ event and to a lesser degree the slideshow battles of TM vs Southshore, there you had a large number of the active logins crammed into one zone.  The server hardware and user clients just couldn't keep up.  
---
Current hardware would fare better, the argument against larger concurrency is overcrowded zones affecting spawn rates and to a degree affecting the economy.  Personally I think 4-5k is fine.  I believe some of the private servers were doing 10k which is just stupid.
---
Tips out, baby
---
Guess it depends on what sort of guild your in, usually though balance and ele are more rare in raids than spriest although spriest isn't exactly common,
---
It did - and (at least imo) it was good that way. Imagine the Orc/Troll starting Zone with 500 Players all fighting for Mobs. You wouldn¬¥t even be able to move properly I guess.
---
When it Comes to anything past the starting zones in the first couple of weeks - I totally agree fck sharding - but for release I think it is a reasonable compromise to make with Blizzard.
---

You think gold grows on trees?
---
Up to a year ago I got the same shit for 15 $.
---
Now paying 10$/month for 1000Mbps.
---
*laughs in hungarian*
---
I will also be chilling on the bank rooftop in Orgrimmar. On my paladin. With my mates, looking down upon what used to be horde in rainbow trout colored gear.
---
You cant do the Stromgarde qs without a Group of 5 or outlevling it. Same for the elite trolls in Hinterland.
---
I do agree with charge being a must in BGs because of the awkward situations you get into but my point still stands when it comes to wpvp/1v1. So to reply to the points you made:
---
If a rogue opens you from stealth while ur in caster form feral charge is not going to save you. 
---
A mage blinks into you and your response is to charge into him instead of travel forming out of range? Don't understand this point
---
You can root people from 36 yards away when they are mounted, why would you charge into them and put yourself in a vulnerable position?
---
If we are talking wpvp/1v1 your goal is to kill the opponent not run away from them. Now ofc you'll get into situations where you have to retreat and most of the times grenades/roots/rockethelm/skull of impending doom/travel form etc will be enough. You don't rely on feral charging a mob (which might not even be there) to get away.
---
36 yards is 32.92 meters
---
&gt; Oh I see! So the goal is to create a talent spec that you don't have to bother respeccing every time you want to switch role?
---
Correct. 
---
&gt;Could work. You'll miss out on opportunities to maximize the potential of either role but if you can do 90% of both roles by gear swap, then I can see that working.
---
Well, yes. That is the backside of playing a hybrid class and one I am willing to take in exchange for actually being a hybrid.
---
&gt;What supporting professions would you go?
---
Havent gotten that far yet. Probably Alchemy as I'm not into PvP at all.
---
Rolling on an NA server will not fix the problem. When you fire up the game in the evening for a play session everyone in NA will be either logging off, asleep, or waking up in the morning.
---
Also remember Oceania is not just Australia an NZ any more in terms of online gaming. There are many more gamers with good English skill playing now. In places like Philippines, Singapore and more.
---
I feel like on private servers there are less guilds and there tend to be more hardcore players, so as such the raiding meta has to be adhered to more. This may be less true with Classic - it's hard to say but given that there'll be much larger server populations of varying skill and quality, there will definitely be more casual guilds who care far less about your spec and more about you being one of 40 bodies that they need to fill a slot. As such you may be able to get away with it. You're pretty much asking to have your cake and eat it, though - you want to stay as a DPS spec because you ultimately want to PvP, so you're going to put a half-hearted effort in at raids just to try and get some gear. I don't personally agree with the strategy but there might be a place for it.
---
No 'serious' guild is going to let you raid with them as Ret because the DPS is legitimately awful, plus you'd ultimately be trying to take weapons and DPS gear that would produce much better output if given to a warrior. Healing output is not great as Ret - a lot of the useful talents for healing paladins revolve around mana regen and healing sustain which are both pretty terrible as Ret. You could do some hybrid spec but you run the risk of being a jack of all trades and master of none. It's possible to boost things up a bit with +healing and some MP5 gear but there isn't a huge amount of MP5 gear around early on. Paladins don't get anywhere near as much benefit from Spirit on gear as say priests or druids, but on the bright side their heals are very mana-efficient when downranked correctly. I don't think you'd be a competitive healer in raids as Ret, even with a load of +healing gear on. I feel like no guild is going to let you spec Ret, then come bottom of the healing charts but also roll on DPS gear that could go to warriors. It doesn't make any sense.
---
Paladins are good in PvP but only really as healers and support - giving blessing of freedom to flag carriers while throwing out quick heals and not dying immediately to rogues due to plate armour and damage reduction. No serious battleground group will take you as Ret either. As holy though, you're valuable.
---
Basically, Ret sucks unless it has really decent gear which is hard to get until nobody else actually needs or wants it.
---
Consider Engineering too, they have some interesting toys and gear.
---
I think what he's trying to say is that AQ is around the time in Vanilla progression where Hunters fall of pretty hard because they don't scale as well as other classes.
---
i'm pretty sure he means "shirts and goggles"
---
That video brings home how smooth the movement and actions feel in WoW. Obviously a Runescape vs. WoW contrast is extreme but seeing the action flip back and forth between games really makes the point. 
---
Movement and combat animations are important. Smooth camera panning is important. Fun colors are important. Believable physics are important. Just watching that night elf dance at the end and see how his gear and cloth flappies move in relation to his physical movement. 
---
John Staats and other Blizz devs who were giving podcast interviews last year usually had something to say about how much the team prioritized making the game feel good to play.
---
Fury warrior is basically the only warrior DPS spec that any guild wants for raiding, so I don't see why that'd be a problem.
---
You wrote Tailor wrong.
---
[panics in bear]
---
I can't pick a class. I am thinking of shaman, hunter or druid. 
---
I kinda wanna be able to farm gold and druids and hunter can do it pretty easy.. but god damn, shaman with some nice windfury pocs can be the dream.. idk
---
lol, such an unnecessarily post, this can apply to the whole forum.
---
I've never played the Vanilla version of WoW... no private servers and only really casually played Post MoP Era Wow. BFA was when I went HC wow but it burnt out real quick and it didn't fill that MMO void I crave so much.
---
I've been watching video after video of what Vanilla WoW was like and what to expect from Classic, this vid being one of them. I can't fucking wait to experience an MMO with this much depth and detail I missed all those years ago, can chill the fuck out and enjoy actual character progression.
---
Lock is harder to play and takes more gear to get going in PvP, but both classes have a very high skill cap.
---
Both classes are very easy to play in PvE. 
---
Go with the class you find more fun tbh.
---
Transmog in cata required you to have the actual piece of gear in your bank, inventory, or void storage. So you had to have the item to use it for xmog.
---
Imo that would be a nice compromise, but whatever.
---
Congrats!  I begin chemistry starting July 1.  Four weeks, 10 hours per day, 4 lab reports per week, and an exam every friday.  Im good and fucked if it launches in July.
---
I only hope I can find a few minutes to log on and enjoy the launch hype.
---
As french, Tailor was not a thing for me.
---
I have a feeling with all the new shit players looking for easy we will have an abundance of horrible warlocks
---
When I first read the headline, I thought this would be a post about if tailoring is worth it for warriors. Lol.
---
A good rogue with _ALL_ cooldowns up shouldn't really lose to anyone 1v1. Without cooldowns it's definitely possible to beat them.
---
Yes, you are able to xmog legendaries in BfA
---
When 14 years ago 2.5-3k cap was enough, today it's too low. Back then there was a constant influx of new people that wanted to try out everything (maybe even several times), didn't have guides that tell what You should do or what is "waste of time", and even without any guides people are overall more experienced now. So less active servers with the same pop cap are pretty much guaranteed.
---
I'd be fine with 500 players in the starting zones. If I got annoyed by competition I'd simply do fedex quests and get exploration xp as well, collect flight points. Nothing states you must conquer every single starting zone quest right away.
---
What are you talking about? SM/Ruin is incredibly strong in PvP, it's on par with nightfall/conflag, just different playstyle. You have no idea what you're talking about tbh.
---
Fuck that guy lmao
---
The correct answer is paladin and druids
---
Bags are expensives ... And dwarf like golds ...
---
I agree with the brackets, the first one concerning 0.3% of the population and allowing to gain 12k RP.
---
But I also understand that only the first player of the faction is gaining 13k rp (a bracket of one person?).
---
Therefore to go from 59.999k rp (rank 13 + 4‚Äô999 rp... missing only one to go to r14) to 60k RP (rank 14), you will have 11‚Äô999.5 rp of decay and gain 12k. Therefore I don‚Äôt understand how you can reach rank 14 without being the first on your server.
---
You can tend to 60k rp but never reach it while being in the best bracket.
---
So I understand this right?
---
I never once wore FR for lava packs.
---
BS has some BoEs that are great, same for LW, just no BoP piece like tailoring. And the ZG stuff (blood tiger/primal batskin for LW, darksoul/bloodsoul for BS) isn't as impactful for either, since physical hit is more common.
---
&gt;Personal prosti... Succubus  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Warlock is vastly better, objectively.
---
FTFY
---
Haha, I prefer PVP server but I can defs understand the want for PVE. Tbh I think PVP servers just add a dynamic into the mix that works really later into the game. Early game and while you're levelling up and everything it can suck but later on when you're at BWL, AQ, etc. and people just go out to get nodes, pick herbs, farm spots, etc. it really spices up the gameplay. Sucks that it comes with the darker side of sadistic bad players that camp lower levels bc they can't compete with ppl at their own level.
---
Oh it‚Äôs not a hard cut off! That explains everything!
---
Thanks a lot !
---
&gt;All classes is easy to play well
---
This sub is such a circlejerk
---
Because when you don't know anything else (i.e. release date), you have to jump on any tiny bit of news.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lI4i1b0N3dk this guy has the comparisons
---
F.  Guess it's regular RP realm for me then.
---
As it should be imo, newer models have no place in classic but thats just my thoughts.
---
A good bit
---
Wow, you character name must be so important
---
.
---
IMO, Thunder Bluff is possibly the greatest city in classic WoW. Org and UC definitely rank lower than SW and IF though.
---
For me it goes (best to worst):
---
TB
---
SW
---
IF
---
Org
---
UC
---
Darn (it looks fine, but it's so damn out of the way)
---
Shh, just keep telling everyone how OP warriors are. The more warriors in Classic the more free kills I get.
---
Sincerely, a hunter
---
Probably because he doesn't play a caster?
---
TFW you are brazilian but current brazilian servers are located in USA anyways
---
You never watched a boss kill video?  Not for BWL, not for AQ, not for Naxx?  
---
Either you didn‚Äôt raid, or you are a liar.
---
"Q" refers to the quarter.  Its how the business worlds breaks up the year.
---
Look at us, speaking like filthy casuals ! ;-)
---
Honestly, I like transmog; it's great for RP purposes.  Unpopular opinion around these parts I guess, but it sure beats having to have a spare set of clothes in your bank.
---
I love your videos. The best part is how you weave in the lore into even mundane descriptions. For example, it is really awesome to not only learn a great new grinding spot, but learn it's history and how it fits into the world. I'm sure it takes a lot of works, so I appreciate it.
---
I love you both
---
That's what I thought but now I'm doubting it
---
Dude what the fuck are you obsessed with me? of the like 80 replies I have gotten on this thread 40 have been from you. You're like a gnat
---
Tanks might out dps your hunters. They are fine dps wise until everyone else has AQ gear. That's right around naxx when they seriously fall behind
---
I expect you to down cthun first try then.
---
I know, but I want to have some money too :P
---
Except it's not a flat value for a specific item such as an ilvl system creates, it depends on the weight the user gives for a stat.  And the great thing about vanilla is that different classes and specs have different weights and that's differentiated even more by people looking for gear that may be a balance for pve and pvp, etc.  It may also help people understand that the item that everyone rolls on because it is popular may not be all that great for them.
---
4 weeks vacation!  That's sick, what do you do?
---
isnt a strength item though ... dont hunters need agility?
---
Thank you for this
---
Not everyone is in the ridiculous #nochanges camp. I think somethings, like blindmode  and  mass mail are good changes.
---
And then when we got frostmourne that was the old blackrock server architecture.
---
This is me too. Nostalgia dwarf huntress with a bit of "hey, cool to actually know what I am doing! Then I might do a mage or warlock, because I never did that in Vanilla.
---
Well I guess that settles it. I'll make sure to give warriors chromagg xbow so they can do maximum threat with the bow pulls. It's for the overall guild progression don't worry.
---
See how fucking dumb that sounds? Melee weaving is dumb and while theorycrafting may show some benefits, raids don't happen In a vacuum. A Hunter is more likely to fuck up his rotation trying to do this and do less damage than if he just focused on the real mechanics of a Hunter. Ya know like trinket swapping/pet management/ not clipping autos/good uptime/positioning.
---
And even if the hunter did do this rotation flawlessly, he's not gonna be a top dps just a big meme. The absolute best hunters I've played with do great damage because of pet management. Respecing your pet with resistances for the raid, and paying people to buff and heal their pets.
---
Melee weaving is a dream just like viable ret dps.
---
&gt;Read the description of each class and whatever class speaks to you the most, roll it.
---
Probably the worst tip I've heard to decide on a class. The description makes them all sound cool but in no way prepare you for what they are like. Mage sounds awesome, but you might honestly hate spamming one spell for half of Classic, then change it to another spell for the other half of Classic. It is fine if you like mages, I think they are awesome in PvP, but I'd never dream of playing one for PvE, yet if I didn't know how their actual PvE gameplay were I'd choose one in a heartbeat. I love wizard type classes in MMORPG for having all kinds of awesome spells, just casting Frostbolt and later Fireball ruins everything I usually like about that archetype.
---
Mechanics and gameplay are important to some people, the theme is not everything. Who would have thought gameplay mattered in a *game?*
---
so much false information, 63 is 8.6 = 9 % hit.
---
In Lebanon the download speeds go between 100 KB/s up to a maximum of 1.2 MB/s if you are in the lucky 5% who happen to living within 500 meter of a CO.
---
Yes its that low in 2019! we have the below plans:
---
Up to 2 Mbps unlimited 40$
---
Up to 4 Mbps unlimited 60$
---
Up to 4 Mbps 40 GB limit 16$
---
Up to 10 Mbps (depending on distance)  50-200 GB for 20-66$
---
Misleading tooltips, sure. But which ones are bugged?
---
Thanks a lot. Great explantation!
---
I bet that fun!.... for like 1 day.
---
What kind of hunter doesn't name their pets?
---
You play feral in pvp right?
---
Oh come on... BfA was fun for about a week
---
Male Troll rogue.
---
Watch out in Stranglethorn, 'cos I'll be the equivalent of a Vietnamese guerilla with jungle sticks.
---
People should remember and care, at least because it still has significant ingame presence during Classic. 
---
You mentioned the Syndicate and the cool detail about color scheme, nothing about them would make sense if it wasn't for their origin story.
---
Most of the ruins and factions have cool lore from previous games worth checking out.
---
Depends on what you want. If you want a real Vanilla experience, don't ask anyone and don't look anything up on the internet. Choose your class on what looks cool in the character screen, do not even read the descriptions. Just stumble into the game and klick around with your mouse.
---
Honestly, do it this way at least a bit with your first character and imagine a time where you couldn't find much information on the web and no one in game knew how to effectively play this except for a hand full of tryhards.
---
It was not a thing in retail vanilla, just one of the million ways in which players were trash back then.
---
"Classic will fail because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
---
You are never the only one if you have to write "Am I the only one?"
---
Yeah, I got some extreme disagreement here. Whatever you might wanna say about class mastery, it almost never actually happens in pve. You are gonna frostbolt, end of the story. And once you do the fight once √¢ne know how long it takes, you know exactly which rank of flash of light or chain heal to use. Even the most complex things like hunter rotation with raptor strike or power shifting mcp feral are jokes compared to most classes at the moment. Threat is basically looking at a bar and afking/feign death/vanish when it's too high.
---
The item metagame is a bit deeper, but that has nothing to do with classes.
---
The topic isn't the social implications of saying "summer 2019" its about when the release date for classic is and what Blizzard most likely meant by "Summer 2019." Leave the social justice for it's own topic.
---
Curse of Weakness when they got to 30% so they can't run away and pull more !
---
While the blacksmithing info is true both of the BiS Crafts are BoE, so you don‚Äôt actually need bs to wear them. Tailoring you actually need for the robes because they are BoP and for the bloodvine set for the setbonus.
---
Only correct for physical dps.
---
Spells need 16% hit
---
We aren't talking about what they should have said. We're talking about what they did say and we're drawing conclusions about it. Do you really think they weren't referring to north american, US summer? Remember, we aren't talking about "should"
---
Yeah $10 for that kind of internet seems pretty awesome but 60% of my income going to taxes doesn't.  I guess it's a trade off.
---
I played a Troll priest through vanilla and loved every moment of it. You‚Äôll be a bit unique since everyone goes for UD. Zerking helps a ton too in a pinch.
---
You got articles and graphs showing what each thing does. It's all on google.
---
You are talking about competition, while EGS is doing fragmentation of market,  it's the opposite of competition.
---
I would not have problem with new models (especially original Tauren is pretty.. uhm.. interesting) but problem would be that they really would need to bring all old gear up to new models. This would be pretty cool for sure but I don't see it happening. So I'm more into old + old models than new + old.
---
Because devouring plague costs like 30% of your total mana, along with already bad mana issues it makes it even worse. Its also dispellable. Its good for 1v1 against classes that cant dispell, but in group pvp its insta dispelled.
---
Troll spriest is amazing because of shadowguard, it scales with spell damage and melee can basically kill themself just hitting you. They can also stun themself because it can proc from blackout talent.
---
And finally they get hex of weakness which is a mini mortal strike effect.
---
Reading comprehension : having world buff is as powerful as having gear two tiers higher.
---
Does 3% crit to four mages offset the damage lost from bringing a oomkin? Not even close.
---
Can you still bring him? Sure but the question is why would you want to play a spec that can't even attack the boss most of the time? Everyone else is doing their part and you're just standing there looking around.
---
I couldnt say, the last time I played retail was about a weeks worth of WoD. I didnt even reach max level.
---
Sooo - why would he not just use the search function right here? :D
---
I must have missed it then because I watched the entire announcement (more than once) and I don't see where they correlate increasing population changes with modifying data. Spawn rates do not need to be increased if there is an increase in resource consumption. The market regulates itself. Just like it was in Vanilla, the market was different in every server depending on the population of that server. Higher pop servers have fewer resources and the market reflects that. Lower pop servers have higher resources but less product availability and market reflects that.
---
**TLDR;** **The market regulates itself. Spawn rates don't need to be modified.**
---
Wrong. Sco founded Method on the realm Sylvanas in vanilla.
---
My comment was meant as a joke. But BfA **was** only enjoyable--to me--for about a week lol. WoD was bad... I really liked it when it first released but I quickly realized just how shitty it was. Garrisons were so bad
---
This is an attack on old school Kaplan. Might as well start lubricating your rear now
---
Of course not - but for the majority of People that will Play classic they won¬¥t have a clue how to attack this - hence they will stay in the starting Zone and have a much easier time with sharding
---
Blizzard has to think about every Player and not just the more experienced players
---
Even 2.5K is pushing it. :) More and it rapidly becomes unplayable.
---
You can see it on the popular private servers. It's a zerg fest where you cannot actually play the game as intended and paradoxically (but not surprisingly, if you think about it), the masses of people everywhere makes the game way less social (what everyone is praising Classic/Vanilla for). It's just a nameless/faceless blur where you can get groups fast (and will need groups to even have a chance at a lot of open world quests, because every mob is dead and everything is camped) get your quest done (without talking) and then leave just as fast, never to see them again. As if we were in BfA and using Dungeon Finder... People seem to play for the population hype, instead of the game.
---
The Vanilla world was intended as a challenge. Where you venture into the wilderness and you are in danger everywhere because of the mobs. You pull carefully, you use all your abilities to survive. And sometimes that's not enough. You'll need help. You then go look for it and overcome the challenges together, forging friendships. You appreciate people because you need them. When there are too many people all this disappears. You are just annoyed by all the other players running around because they just get in the way. Or, as said, you "group" to even have a chance at quests but they become entirely challenge free and there will be no social interaction either.
---
Mark Kern, team lead on Vanilla (and others) have confirmed that the popcap was intentional design decision. And judging from what Blizzard revealed about how they go about recreating Vanilla, I'm pretty hopeful they'll not raise it because they know it would be antithetical to the Vanilla gameplay.
---
careful - I wrote similar Thing in his last post like 3-4 post's below and got downvoted... Gotta watch out for the reddit Police :D
---
I don't understand why lol.  I said I hope I'm wrong... It's just my opinion that it will not "blow up massively" over an extended period of time.  There's less than 80k people in this subreddit.  That's less that 8% of one million people.  If you go look at view counts on youtube from say Tips Out and Kargoz, there just aren't a lot of people watching these well put together very informative Classic videos.  I know that these numbers aren't exactly indicative of how many people will actually be playing the game, but they are extremely low if the expectancy of players is thought to be in the multiple millions.  Where are all these people at?  I'm not seeing them in places I would expect to see them.
---
Garrisons was actually the main reason I quit. I didnt feel like an MMO anymore. It was basically a single player game.
---
Spawn rates don't need to be changed to accommodate higher population caps. Back in Vanilla, servers with really high populations didn't need special spawn rates. If there was less resources to deal with and you went somewhere else or you'd buy it off the AH.
---
You did the right thing! You also did it in a cool way. That kid probably still remembbers the good deed you did, even if he felt felt awkward at the time. Which probably was because he didn't have the money... nothing else.
---
Would and should are 2 different things.
---
This will be how I make my decision. Thank you sir/madam.
---
Shamans/Paladins and druids for sure. Priests should be the last ones to get it because they already get Benediction/Anathema. And if ZG is out/coming out soon paladins should just get the Jin'do mace. So shammies and druids prio.
---
Well, if you don't want to do other people's work for them, that's just fine, but just posting "google it lol" is not contributing to the discussion at all.
---
This is a rare case of downvotes actually spent for their intended person. You both didn't want to contribute ‚Äì which is, again, fine ‚Äì but still posted and increased the noise in the subreddit.
---
Yeah, the only way rolling on an NA server would work is by the oceanic community deciding which one to roll on/transfer to. In the same way that proudmoore and black rock did back in the day. 
---
Of course, oceanic extending to other regions aside from NZ and Aus is great, wasn‚Äôt a thing back in the day, (game wasn‚Äôt even available iirc) so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a change everyone can get behind!
---
Meh, it‚Äôs all opportunistic killing though. It‚Äôs rarely a fair fight and then it‚Äôs just annoying to me. Each to their own though!
---
Female dwarf priest or female human or gone mage
---
Nah man worst phase is the one where people just post shitty fan art
---
I can't count the number of times I used FC as a root. Great against hunters, too: instant root so you can chill in their dead zone? Invaluable. Also great for skirmishes with more than just 2 players. Mate got a melee on them? Bear to the face. Mage trying to poly your mate? Bear to the face.
---
Though I'd like to see you hard cast entangling roots on a warrior coming at you on an epic mount with a rogue stuck to your butt. I'd rather rocketbear the warrior in the face, rooting him and losing the rogue in the process.
---
&gt; over the former. Hell I'm soon getting even unlimited data 4G with 80/25 Mb/s real world speeds for only 20‚Ç¨ a month. Do you guys live in very remote rural places, places with a lot of corruption, or just in poverty stricken areas? If you live in an urban environment in the West, it is basically criminal to suck that much money for a 2004 standard 
---
Internet speed in North Asia and Northern Europe is not indicative of the rest of the world, unfortunately. Unfortunately internet is monopolised in a lot of countries, monopolised and over provisioned. I have 50/10 (advertised) VDSL2 here in Australia, for about $70 a month.
---
RemindMe! 74 days
---
I see you are a man of taste, for I also like dwarves and warriors.
---
It's fun to talk about.
---
Anything but August/September and i‚Äôll be happy.
---
I'm telling someone where he/she will find answer to these questions. If that's offensive today, well fuck it. I might agree with you If I just said "google it noob". My answer is neutral.
---
I loved healing. I started as a hunter as I liked the idea I could solo a lot as I got to 60. I'll probably make my 2nd alt a level 60 hunter.
---
But the Shammy was brilliant in PVP, especially epic AV battles and Arathi. I found I was hard to kill and could keep several team members alive, even in Pugs. I got great honor and ranked up to level 9 while just pugging. 
---
I  liked how easy it was to get groups for 5 mans at 60 on the shammy, and raids spots were good too. 
---
So this time I'm making the shammy my 1st character. :D

Check [this site.](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) It does a good job of visually showing BiS for each patch.
---
Even without melee weaving, the weapon is still Best in Slot or second. It gives more AP at the cost of less crit compared to the other option. Some would argue the additional AP is better, thus BiS.
---
Giving wariors Chromaggs xbow is not remotely similar to this.
---
Example 1: You give Hunters Ashkani, resulting in a substantial DPS increase for the the raid.
---
Example 2(your example): You give a warrior the chromagg xbow, resulting in a net DPS loss, as a hunter who could of used that bow, does not have it and instead a warrior does. Resulting in a dps loss for the raid.
---
Warriors only use for Ashkandi is for PvP which is irrelevant when it comes to raiding. That is why they don't have priority on it. Giving a warrior Ashkandi over a hunter would be the same as giving a hunter Dark Edge of Insanity, so that he can use its special effect in PvP.
---
See how dumb THAT sounds? That is an accurate example of what giving Ashkandi to a warrior over a Hunter would be like.
---
Probably cause noone else wanted it, not unusual for a epic 2 hander to drop but the warriors in the 20 man already have better so they all pass on it. Basically comes down to roll for hunters/paladins
---
https://de.wowhead.com/news=290929/classic-wow-news-discord-webhook-new-site-feature Sorry for the late reply, I was on a music trip so I couldn't post it earlier :)
---
That's the site from which you can access the Classic Webhook.
---
It's not offensive at all. It just doesn't contribute to the discussion.
---
Everyone know you can theoretically google it. That's not an insight.
---
I still hate what they did to a lot of the faces, female humans and nelfs look bad now.
---
It's just sad that People are putting hundreds of hours of work into researching and compiling great Information and People just don¬¥t care and think it's much easier to ask and let other's do the work
---
At least that is how it feels sometimes - especially asking almost the same question twice in 20mins in two Posts.
---
And I would say it is actually contributing to the discussion :O It was the first comment and lead him to the most knowledgable source of Information there is on the Internet. I wouldn¬¥t say that is a bad advice or not contributing.
---
but every1 has his opinions I guess
---
I did them in vanilla wow with a group of 3. Hunter, Pally and Druid.  Toughest group quest we had was the Scholo Key, killing the elite. 
---
To be fair our Pally was already raiding MC/BWL when we got him to help.
---
Yeah no problem. I had a feeling that's where your confusion was stemming from, but just wanted to cover my bases. 
---
Not sure why the other guy is being so hostile, I'm generally against spreading misinformation as fact too, but it came off as more of a discussion and this information isn't that widely available to begin with.
---
&gt; The genre, MMORPG, isn‚Äôt popular anymore.
---
There hasn't been a good MMORPG since Burning Crusade, so of course the genre is dying.
---
But don't blame the genre for all the shitty free-to-play, pay-to-win, derivative garbage that developers have been trying to cram down our throats for the past decade.
---
Are these values averages? Average across all boss fights, or average across the entire instance (trash+bosses)?
---
&gt;"guardian druid?"
---
DAE think retail renaming balance guardian is shit?
---
Which discussion are you even talking about? His comment was about to start a discussion :d
---
But hey - I was talking about the reddit Police - and here it comes
---
I hadn‚Äôt even thought about this. Beat to unsubscribe the first few days I guess.
---
&gt;I think it was said the majority of MC was developed in a weekend or something.
---
I wouldn't think so, it would take much longer than a weekend to code the models and animations.  Where did you read that?
---
Who me?
---
What do i spend gold on if im not saving up for the lvl40 mount? 
---
now i just find myself buying blue upgrades on AH with my paladin because i know i will get my mount anyway :D
---
I will forever be calling that class drood!
---
A question was asked. I told the guy where the answer is. Do you want me to copy paste one of the articles or make my own essay based on it? Why? Reading the original is the best option here.
---
/whoosh
---
Also wrong.
---
Jesus do you ever stop?
---
The populations where pretty low compared to pservers though. But yeah I agree, people can get around it. It just would advise against much higher pop caps in general though. It isn't just about resources, but also about familiarity.
---
I'll take one for the team chief.
---
Fair point.
---
Female dorf priest
---
I kinda expect most hardcore guilds to down c'thun first try so, yeah, sure.
---
Meteorologists use June 1 to August 31 because it's much, much easier to handle than the dates you mention, which come from astronomy.
---
Neither describe the "hottest quarter of the year in the northern hemisphere" particularly well. That comes later and is very different from place to place, depending on latitude and distance to the ocean.
---
16% hit on spells ? How can a pre-raid gear beat that?
---
#  Only one faction per realm on PvP realms
---
Fuck yes :)
---
Lol yeah. Buckle up. I feel like I triggered a shitstorm here and I still don't know how it happened.
---
Oops sry yeah 9
---
I don't want you to do anything. You are not obligated to do any of that.
---
But if you don't have anything worthwhile to say, don't say anything. And "It's on Google" isn't helpful.
---
This made me smile. Have an upvote.
---
Personally the gold seller advertismements bothered me alot. Best case scenario would be to not have people buy gold at all, sure. Tokens might be the lesser of two evils though, objectively speaking. But I'am not going to push for it.
---
Oh cool, can I arrest you now? Do I get a badge and a pistol? Neat.
---
Don't be silly. I'm just telling you why people often downvote stuff like this.
---
Help me decide between resto shaman or holy priest!
---
I played sham from WoTLK through BFA. They are my favorite class and I like them totems. But I hear priests are the best all round healers...
---
Also, gonna be leveling in a group of 4. Other three are going warrior, rogue, and mage.
---
Could interpret it that way, really limited info from this call so its kind of hard to read into it either way.
---
Fair enough, although OP is asking about warrior/priest duo. Those two cant complete the qs i mentioned but they will have an easy time finding a group.
---
Question for those who raided as Holy in Vanilla or Private Realms:
---
The Priest healing toolkit is vast and diverse, and with downranking you have access to over a two dozen different spells and abilities. But how many of those spells are you **really** using in your average raid? What are your bread and butter spells and ranks that you're actually pressing 90% of the time?
---
I would prefer real-talk concerning the average mid-endgame raider, not the world first ultra min-maxer! I know the Priest skillceiling is high.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
 I  understand why people like the new models but the artistic liscense  taken with some of them and the scale in which things have been dialed  up on the high fantasy meter to become more over the top is just not for  me. It feels like they went from a 4 to an 11, then added more numbers  to the dial to further exaggerate an already exaggerated artstyle. It's  far to OTT.
---
It has gradually  transitioned away from their original art style over the years and  doesn't reflect the Warcraft I grew up with and loved. The way they were  made in vanilla is a perfect middle ground and it doesn't deviate from  their style at the time. I loved Metzen and Sams work during the 2000s  but especially Twincruisers in the RPG manuals. The Sons of the Storm  (RIP) site was something I visited regularly.
---
It's  been pushed too far over the years and while I understand an artist  wants their work to evolve, they're foreign to me and it honestly feels  like the new models are something conjured up from another studio. It's  not something I'm saying to be spiteful either.  It's quite shocking to  me that they're from the same studio. I very genuinely mean it and I've  always been passionate about WC. Ever since I first gleaned over the WC  rts manuals. Don't get me started on the new animations, or the  hairstyles.
---
Yes it is. I can't believe I have to defend this. This set of questions was asked for a very long time. It's intresting and makes you a better player to a small degree. I pointed someone to a place with answers to these questions. I'm repeating myself but what else is there to say? It's basic logic in my mind.
---
It should go to resto sham/druids first
---
Then your spriest
---
Then a a raiding ele or balance
---
You can't really "chill" in a hunters deadzone after a charge, it's only a 4 second root. Not to mention he can trinket/spiderbelt it. Improved entangling roots let you root him as much as you like though with way more uptime. And that warrior/rogue situation is very niche and specific, I can come up with hundreds of situations where it would get you killed to charge into someone in a 2v1 situation, but win if you max range instead. Doesn't bring much to the argument. But hey, i'll agree to disagree. If feral charge is that important for you in wpvp then get it man, we all have different playstyles. Good luck.
---
biggest gripe in all of WoW PvP is not being able to attack anyone.  
---
Whoever disrespects 1v1's should get gankd.
---
Does discipline have its place im vanilla? I haven't heard hardly any discussion about while trolling the sub for days and days.
---
People who buy gold from sellers already know where to get it, without concerns. Tokens aren't a deterrent, it's just blizzard having a share by making some of the rest to safely buy gold. This can't work with classic, gold is too big of a deal there and while people will still find a way to buy gold, i'd rather not have the shining "Token" button on my screen. People ignore the psychological part of this.
---
They're both very solid PvP classes with high skill ceilings.
---
Mage is more about being elusive and mobile.
---
Warlock is more about using fear, death coil, seduce, while you watch their life drain away.
---
Google gives a LOT of wrong information.
---
"It's all on Google" isn't helpful. If you had supplied a search term or spent the ten seconds do dig up the link, that would have been helpful.
---
Again: it's fine if you don't want to do that work for others. But if you don't, why post at all?
---
\&gt; "Most" specs spam 1-2 spells in vanilla. You have cookiecutter builds for every situation (same in retail). Y 
---
I think his point was that regardless of whether there were "cookie-cutter" builds available, people had choice, and that choice allowed people to play their classes however they wanted.
---
If they wanted to dump a bunch of points into an off-spec talent field they could, and did.
---
We had hunters in our guild who we occasionally had to bring to raids to fill numbers who insisted on going Vanilla BM for raiding, when Marksman was the clear talent tree to go up for those big raiding numbers.  We had rogues who showed up PvP specced, etc; the list of things people did off spec, to the detriment of the group is endless, dealing with a rotating cast of 60-80 people.
---
NOW, if people are the wrong spec you can make them switch right there.  There are no useless spells within your spec, and while you might use the wrong ability, or have your talents a bit screwy, you aren't gonna come in there completely inappropriate for the task and without the tools to do it.
---
It wasn't harder in a strictly more technically difficult sense, but it was harder in a social, sense, especially considering in Vanilla, repeccing cost like a ridiculous amount of gold every single time at a time when gold wasn't as inflated as it is in the retail economy, and so people didn't want to do it.
---
So do random redditors
---
And reddit is beacon of truth and knowledge. No one ever lied here he raided Naxx and is an expert.
---
Statistics and fact make people cuckolds? I didn't know that. Running around calling people cucks really makes you look like a little cuck bitch. Just Saying.
---
Druid is horde and alliance.
---
Shaman is horde only and Paladin is alliance only.
---
No I‚Äôm not.
---
Funny though how the people accusing me of demanding have the people making demands on their side. Learn to read kid.
---
Statistically speaking, they are European.  Maybe German?
---
It definitely has it's niche, especially in PvP. Most of the priests in a raid are going to be holy, but I think many do make space for a Disc.
---
Too me the choice is simple Ill be playing same as my current main: DH
---
Yes. But the tailoring gear is bop. Bs and lw gear is boe. All three have pre bis gear
---
Where I live (Germany) using the equinox is the normal way of distinguishing seasons and I don't understand why that would make you iamverysmart material. People are stupid.
---
Going to play a healer, but won't have time for an alt. I want to be able to fund my raiding on the one character without tons of respecs. I am leaning towards shaman, but considering priest. I have no desire to play paladin, and hear that there aren't really rdruid raid spots (one per raid compared to 8 shamans). What am I overlooking? Shamans should be easier to gear than priests. Primarily playing PVE.
---
No it‚Äôs not based off statistics and facts. And yes I am a cuckold.
---
They didn't.
---
BIS for healing priest regardless of spec involves a bit of field marshal gear for the stamina and at least the two piece set bonus for twenty stamina, and at least 3/8 T2 for the 15% mana regen bonus as well. +healing rings, and back. I use a spell hit neck with high stamina as well. Trinkets, the ZG Charm of healing trinket is BIS. It is so freaking good. Reduces cast time of greater heal by 40% for 5 seconds. The other slot can be pvp trinket, engineering items, etc. I always roll with a 1h and offhand. That way I can use both skull of impending doom and furblog medicine pouch. Always carry at the very least elixir of poision resistance, and restoration potions. I have two videos where I unfortunately don't show all my gear (I'll do so next time,) but you can see it all in action:
---
https://youtu.be/BvN_0IATp7U
---
The other one is a lot longer with a lot more variety and is on the channel if you just click it as well.
---
Then what is it, feral?
---
‚ÄúMaga4life...‚Äù yep. Real edgy.
---
Nothing wrong with using it as google AFTER you‚Äôve already searched google and the forums and nothing came up.
---
What does method or sponsorship have fuck all to do with it?
---
No one in the raiding scene cares about ‚Äúworld first Nef kill (again)‚Äù. Speed running is somewhat interesting, but world first classic is like taping Jeopardy and ‚Äúguessing‚Äù the eighth answers.
---
Because I give people benefit of the doubt and assume they know how to type "wow vanilla resistance how does it work" on google. I just don't consider the author of the thread a complete idiot from the start.
---
I won't give people strict instructions for simple tasks. I wouldn't want people to do that to me because that means they think I'm a simpleton.
---
I was referring to the whole post in general not just this :)
---
Feral got split into Feral and Guardian, druid now has 4 speccs.
---
I would say that item metagame is a large part of the "know you're class" though. Knowing those obscure items that will push your class that little bit extra in terms of performance is what makes some players just that little bit better.
---
Yes, most of the information about it is out there, but there is also a lot of "misinformation" and speculations, so a lot of it you just have to test for yourselfs to truly figure out the most optimal way to play.
---
And as a vanilla healer I have to disagree with your assement of down ranking. It's not about finding the "right" rank and sticking with it. I have 2-3 different ranks of most of my healing spells hotbared and keybound, then you have to adjust the use on the fly depending on the situation. Length of fight remaining, dmg output of the boss, amount of other healers dead, etc, etc.
---
The smooth movement and delivery of combat is what sold e on the game. I started on Guild Wars 1 in 05 right before swapping to Vanilla. It wasn‚Äôt even that bad, but compared to WoW, it felt like my character was in Jello. 
---
There‚Äôs other reasons Vanilla succeeded. Established lore, casual friendly, low system requirements... but none of that matters if the game feels disconnected from the player, and I still feel like WoW has the best movement/combat directness than most modern MMOs.
---
I mean they have said they are going to release with a small amount of servers, so I'm going to assume the cap will be a bit higher at least to start.  They want stable realms after all the tourists leave so it makes sense, it's a hard line to strike though, IMO... I wonder what % of people they are expecting to be around after 10, 30, 100 days..
---
Ah I see
---
That doesn't make it worth it.. that just means you don't care that it isn't.
---
Raids bring the players not the Class.
---
I mean in the beginning, where Guilds are newly recruiting and everyone is unknown during the MC Phase, people will probably look to bring like optimal Raid composition, but by the time BWL comes around, you got a Reputation on a Server. It will happen to everyone. You will meet people in Groups and naturally people will talk to you about their Raid, if they have an open spot.
---
I played Rogue, I never looked for Groups, I got invited to a Raid and to Dungeons, people knew they could count on me as a fair and good player. 
---
No one ever said to me: oops sorry you are a Rogue, you are out.
---
This accurately describes, played both.
---
I agree with you atyon as I said - I just become a dick on reddit - but it's one of those cases - his answer wasn¬¥t really bad - there is plenty of much worst answers he could have given and that are given every hour in this reddit.
---
Not fair to go on about the one "Google it" he gave which is still better than a lot of answers here :P
---
Let's leave it guys!
---
I think Google it is a fair answer - but I also agree that there is a way to be more helpful!
---
Though there is no rule stating that your answer has to be helpful and contributing to the (not yet existing) discussion.
---
BUT THATS ME AS A DICK AGAIN *_*
---
Have a nice day folks
---
Priests are go to, but you probably have less gear competition as a resto shaman in that you are the only one who will really wear spirit mail, and your main competition is holy paladins.  Unless hunters need shammy mail? They might tell you that. Don't believe their lies, even if it's true. There will probably be more holy priests than pallies. 
---
Also, windfury for your melee classes is never unappreciated. I think shaman would be more challenging. Chain heal is one of the limited AOE heals in vanilla, too. It's so fun to cast. 
---
I think you're doing a good thing for your mates with whatever healer class you choose. You can't really lose.
---
I believe dragonscale leatherworking also has some BiS within the black dragonscale set?
---
Warlocks were creeping ahead of mages in my guild after they started to get some gear. 
---
Rogues/Warriors started overtaking us in AQ.
---
Mages did bring a bit more utility though and were needed for decurse at least
---
Im playing survival hunter and I don't even care if you virgins group with me or not.
---
dude I've been asking and looking for that answer for the past couple of weeks and you just did a home run with it, thanks a lot
---
I'll check your channel after work
---
cheers mate
---
Same here! Alliance Shaman all the way!!111
---
Vaelstraz was effectively a gear check.  You have to have been able to absorb X amount of damage on your tank while healing Y amount and doing Z overall DPS in order to beat it.  There is almost no movement.  The healers have to heal a lot.  The DPS have to DPS alot.
---
The hardest job in the fight belonged to the Main Tank who had to time his cooldowns properly, and to the MT healers, who had to keep him up while was being smashed by Vael.
---
T2 LOL!
---
Everyone knows a full Twill set is the OG
---
More like 'genuine interest and/or questions' followed by bitter trolls who spend waaay too much time here shitting on people
---
why ignore holy priests? lok is a significant upgrade to benediction.
---
No problem dude
---
I want to offtank preferably but I'll take dps if it's available for sure :)
---
It‚Äôs better for earlier raids, so I‚Äôve heard. Mages don‚Äôt have quite as much crit, so 3% is more valuable. And even though your damage sucks, other DPS aren‚Äôt packing in hue numbers yet. Still, another mage would be a bigger DPS boost.
---
However, you have to account that you also bring Innervate and Battleres. So on some fights, I would rather have that boomkin than a mage. That‚Äôs half a mana bar for a priest, and a resurrect for a DPS that dies at the start of the fight. Sure, you can‚Äôt bres every attempt, but when you do, you‚Äôre essentially taking credit for all the damage that person does from then on. 
---
I would gladly take a geared, skilled boomkin to ZG, AQ, MC or maybe even BWL. AQ40 and Naxx get a little bit tight numbers wise though, and it‚Äôs a harder case to make... but I‚Äôm sure *some* guild would take one.
---
whatever you do, don't play mage on my server
---
They already said their aim is to use modern more restrictive api which means no decursive or automatic downranking of spells.
---
The first step is to decide which classes you really don't wanna play. Then, you only have 8 classes to choose from! Nice huh?
---
Sure, but I mean, on my shaman in retail I have 15 different healing buttons and cooldowns. Which one to press is as much a decision as in classic.
---
What does it say? I'm at work, and can't reach blizzard.com
---
In classic, I ran SM/ruin for PvE and PvP and never respeced.  If you are well geared but behind the curve you might do better with SL in PvP though.  SM/Ruin is about killing people with shadow bolt while you cc them.  If you can't kill someone in 3 shadow bolts plus some dots you might need to go to SL.  
---
You will need gold for repairs, professions, alts, I'm sure you can imagine some others.  SM/ruin has some really cool ways to farm too, though.  You can do runs through SM backdoor.  You enslave the demons in there and use them to fight the guys it's a ton of fun and very lucrative.  Even more so if you have herbalism to pick up the ghost mushrooms in there but you'll get loaded with felcloth and other drops.
---
You will still see 100+ people in the starting area even with sharding though...
---
Sharding doesn‚Äôt put you with 2 other people who you never see.
---
Ignite skews the conversation, you have the highest top potential as a mage but it's usually just the one or two mages, on average I would guess warrior remains number 1 with locks and mages behind
---
We're too deep in this to give up now. It's time to take vacations and fight for my morals. The first person who didn't respond within 30 minutes loses the discussion. It's the unwritten rule of forum shitstorms. The last word guy wins. 
---
Stay out of this if you're afraid for your life or have an uncomfortable chair.
---
Miss / Hit and spell resistance are entirely different mechanics that do not interact with eachother in any way. 
---
The more resist you have the greater chance you have of partially or fully resisting spell damage of whatever school you are stacking. Google around if you want the actual spell resistance table that gives you detailed numbers on how much resist gives you whatever % to resist.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the quiver for that s3xy wand speed.
---
Because those 10000 people aren‚Äôt all going to be logging into the same level 1-6 zone at exactly the same time like they will on launch
---
In Maryland you can get a  gigabit connection from Verizon for like $69.99
---
So real talk, will I really not get a raid spot if I go huntard? Even if I'm pro and super committed?
---
This is one of the super important things to me. People look exactly as they are. I hate it when some poorly geared piece of sh\*t looks like he is wearing the best tier in the game. I personally hate transmog to my guts.
---
Cause you have benediction?
---
How ducking greedy do you need to be?
---
Oh yes you're on the many did kt and rank 14liars.
---
 It is as you say: none of it matters if the player senses the digital divide between their brain and the game. Bioware Austin had many of those advantages with SWTOR but they picked an engine that just didn't really allow for the game to feel great to play. It's still kind of a shame that it looked and felt kind of clunky because that game was probably just a better play experience away from being a hit.
---
Yes really, it's not even related to subject, why bring it up just to shit on method?
---
&gt; They CANNOT keep the vanilla experience if they change the population limits, without also increasing resource availability... ie modifying spawn rates of everything from herbs, up to and including black lotus, mobs, for loot up to and including devilsaur leather, and minerals from copper to Rich Thorium.
---
It's not gonna have the vanilla experience anyway, you dumb cuck.
---
With regular mid-tier raid gear, the aura should be at around 100-120dps per group of 4 mages in a completely static fight. Not really worth it.
---
Obviously im talking about initial feel of a class description and what class you like the most. 
---
For me at the end of the day its all about how you feel as a person,what class that you identify with the most. 
---
I love being sneaky and stealthy in games and ambush mobs with a huge burst of attack so rogue is just up my alley.
---
Learning later that Combat Sword rogue was the best way to play dont change my mind about that i want to play with daggers cuz thats what speaks to me the most. Sry to hear mage PVE gameplay was boring to you but it still doesnt change the class is what you identify with if you like playing a wizard type of class.
---
Nah, I bet they have googled it.  They just weren't convinced one way or the other by what they found, so they're looking for more opinions.  I see nothing wrong with it, although I would actually prefer they necro an old thread than start a brand new one.  I don't know why we need hundreds of Reddit threads all discussing the same things.
---
Thank you sir. I will probaly go for a fury warrior.
---
Rsham is definitely highly desired in raids, but you also end up fighting 7 other shaman for loot, and druid aren't THAT rare usually 2 to 3 per raid, BR and innervate,  are both super powerful. They are both pretty tough to farm with though, holy nova however is good at farming lashers
---
Don't have to worry about competition from Paladins as a Shaman because they're Alliance only and Shaman Horde only.
---
At 11 years old I couldn't even stick to a single character (in EQ - WoW wasn't out yet).
---
Meanwhile you guys are affording epic mounts and shit.
---
I literally just watched a video of a gnome leveling from 1-60 on a private classic server. Even with only like 3 other players, that one quest took him over 30 minutes to complete due to other players swooping in and grabbing the item. 
---
Is that quest that important to complete? It seems to me that it would be more worth your time to skip it and do other, quicker quests.
---
That I can agree with! Familiarity is essential to the Vanilla experience.
---
Blizzard being born from the ashes mid funeral with classic though
---
I absolutely love that we're going back to a time where there's a wand spec.
---
Pardon me for going off my 20 years of field experience and fixing computers. 
---
You sound like someone who is really fun at parties.
---
I see in what positon you are trying to put me into, and while I can appreciate you trying to challenge me, I am forced to mansplain this in a condescending way that you are a complete moron.
---
What you stated are litteral facts. What I stated are litteral facts. This game is not a human being and therefore cannot do any of the aforementionned.
---
You on the other hand got so triggered by my light hearted comment, probably because, for you, it hit home, that you immediately got out your HELP! SEXIZM! card and when I had the nerve to reply to what I should just have ignored, you immediately made this all about you. 
---
There was no attempt at starting a flame war on my side but you sure want one. Probably to show the world how BADLY women are treated on the internet and other senseless drivel.
---
This is my final comment and won't comment further. But feel free to REEEEE at me.
---
Haha xD 
---
I think I¬¥m out then at least - defend our honor here m8! Getting off work in 20mins and I¬¥m not missing out on that opportunity :D
---
I can't choose between troll shaman or troll priest yet. But it will be a troll healer for sure. I'm afraid there's too much shaman at release.
---
Oh are we talking about classes that take no effort?
---
#yo hunters where ya at
---
^ This
---
Server transfers were available in vanilla and I wish they are in classic, I can't be arsed to be unlucky enough to choose a bad server and having to restart from scratch
---
Not during actual vanilla no. But then again nobody is talking about the past hopefully, players are not the same, nor are the conditions.
---
I‚Äôm not spitting in method. World first and progression raiding new content is cool. 
---
Killing nef first the second time, isn‚Äôt. Method isn‚Äôt even planning on raiding for real in vanilla. Some guys may meme in esfands guild, but that guild is aiming for server first not region/world.
---
Right, but who cares if it's an ***optional*** thing someone can turn on?
---
It has been written
---
having your stuns resisted somewhat frequently in bgs
---
i wanna be a healer... or a tank.. or... damnit not this again
---
OP, Are you WallaceMartin? Because that sounds exactly like a memory I have from back in the day in BWL.
---
&gt;and we'll follow up in Q4 with our second most important release, another CoD release
---
*Activision, probably*
---
Our demand is to keep the game pure as it was, you want to pick and choose. We‚Äôre both making demands, you‚Äôre the one being selfish. 
---
Cool chat room insult, though, ‚Äúkid.‚Äù
---
Good. More time to grind up tokens in retail.
---
Dude, there is so much left to discuss, like: 
---
Will blizzard let us know the release date in time for me to book holidays?
---
Gamers aren't accustomed to sitting through 2+ hour long dungeons for the chance at gear anymore.
---
Today, you get gear within minutes. You get rewarded with badges and skins after your first "victory," whatever the game may be. If you don't want to wait, you can pay for upgrades and different cosmetics. Games don't last long - Fortnite games last a max of **20 minutes** and you don't have to stay if you don't win. Call of Duty, Halo, and other mainstream games are the same: nothing last longer than about 20 minutes.
---
If a company invests the many, many millions of dollars it would take to produce a modern MMO, they can almost guarantee they won't make the return without F2P-Microtransaction antics. Do you think Blizzard made a cash-shop because they wanted you to have cute pets?
---
World of Warcraft: ~~End~~Beginninggame
---
In groups for warriors, its tank all the way. When tanking I'd always take a ret, but dps wars could screw off. Rets just bring so much utility to 5mans it's amazing, even the back-up rez alone is worth it.
---
In raiding though, dps war will be more common. Bad news though, you'll basically be dual wielding and wearing leather. Horde can kinda get away with 2hander thanks to WF totem, but in generally the big plate wearing 2hander archetype is really only realized in pvp.
---
People who demand you play the game this way will ruin it, now gear me out as I demand you play the game the way I like it. 
---
I‚Äôm done being polite with you people: fuck the fuck off. No one gives a shit about your shitty opinion. Let people play the game however they want.
---
That's unfortunate. As a teacher I was really looking forward to no-lifing for a month before going back to being an adult.
---
There is partial shift. In gaming golden age you saw only best, rich playable games on spotlight. Now, spotlight is often taken by games containing flaws from golden age gamer perspective. When companies see what is currently taking spotlight they are mimicing patterns. It's corporate companies lack of balls and creative which is crippling gaming. Thankfully, situation is not near that grim - there is still high quality among CDPR, Rockstar (RDR2) and Playstation exclusives. 
---
Incorporating mobile gaming aspects to PC should be to blame - worst are brought to PC gaming. Wish people would stop throwing money on games meticulously crafted to drain their wallet, which offer them instead poor theme park and gameplay no way near gaming standards.
---
I'll be out there grinding. No time for lollygaggin'. I don't have entire days to do nothing like I did in college haha.
---
Kids these days...
---
Def. First Mage. Then Farm gold with Mage to pull up a warrior with friends u made while leveling the mage. :)
---
The further away the better! It just means that I can save up more vacation days for its release ;). 
---
Fun thought, might be advantageous to schedule PTO starting a day or two AFTER launch... as we all know the first couple of days will be a chit show and not worth allocation vacation days.
---
I am not making demands, you and your side are and have been doing personal attacks, so fuck off and learn to read.
---
I already have addressed your slipper slope argument elsewhere. I‚Äôm sick of replying to the same 2 arguments that are complete shit.
---
Not going to lie, im going to miss tmog a bit.  **I am not saying it should be added**, its just going to kind of suck to get a decent amount of tier or whatever, but then have a few odd pieces that 'ruins' the look.
---
Im willing to deal with it, but in an RPG where customization is kind of a pillar of the game, i think tmog was actually a nice addition, and quite frankly dont understand when people say 'everyone looks the same on retail', because that flat out is NOT my experience.  I see a ton of different mogs running around, many of which are very unique.
---
They're not bad though, mages are the top dogs for aoe farming but warlocks can do it and it isn't that hard really
---
Female troll &gt; male undead
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd take anything Tips Out says with a bucket of salt.
---
I'd actually say mobile games are either Sami Zayn or Christian: They **can** be great; however, take one look at them and one look at a main eventer and you'll immediately believe the bigger guys are better. Also, for every one of these guys, there are 50 knock-offs that look just like them, making it harder for them to go over in the mainstream.
---
Rogue, warrioir, rogue, rogue, rogue
---
You cant even tmog thunderfury, can you?  Its a legendary.
---
gold sellers are still limited by the gold generated in game. Blizzard is not and can make as much gold as they like resulting in more inflation and forcing people to buy gold at a higher rate to keep u with the inflated prices that can‚Äôt be maintained naturally. 
---
You should see what happened to the FF11 prices when they went whole hog into going after gold sellers.
---
We don't even have a release date.. play the game and find a guild along the way.
---
Your first reply started with calling him selfish and you say I‚Äôm the one with personal attacks after calling me a kid. 
---
Great logic there. 
---
You act like there‚Äôs no such thing as a slippery slope when this entire subreddit is dedicated to the idea that the game has fallen down a slippery slope. You are a fool.
---
Hope it's not there, it kinda plays the game for you, like some modern add-ons do.
---
Warriors are top melee dps and the only viable raid tanks (besides potential feral druid with MCP but I'm not getting into that here).
---
Yes, people make space for them in raids...
---
BRES, Innervates, chicken.
---
Play what you want :)
---
"Spawn rates don't need to be modified"
---
yes they do - you cant have double the amount of raisers but the same spawn rate for elementals to make fire res potions - markets will go insane and guilds will be stuck on progress purely because they cant grind enough mats because of fixed spawn rates.
---
Spawn rates determine the max amount of resources that can be collected - if these are not connected to the realm population the the game will feel different because the availability will be different - the rarity of items will change because resource collection will be fixed but consumption will be increased - there will only ever Spawn X number of elementals in the blasted lands to collect X reagent wether or not the pop cap is 2500 or 5000.
---
That's 16ish Mb/s
---
1 MB = 8 Mb
---
It‚Äôs so hard to pick one over the other. I played from Vanilla all the way up through till the end of Wrath, and the difference from vanilla to Wrath is quite extreme!
---
Most of what I know from reading other posts is that warlocks are generally considered easier to level than mages. In my experience this was certainly the case up until around lvl 40, where IMO mages take a slight advantage.
---
Portals do help in gold farming, but if you‚Äôre playing at expansion, there is a thought folks may not be quite so willing to spend the usual 1g to buy a portal (this is generally considered fair because of the cost of mats to make the portal, plus a small tip).
---
But, being able to hop around the continents is a huge advantage towards completing those annoying quests with all the crazy traveling, or running to dungeons. 
---
But I think you‚Äôre right - you‚Äôre going to want to play both, haha. Tbh, a warlock may be better as your first class, even if only for the free mount (I know, tough quest). But saving the gold on your first toon while the economy is in development is probably worth waiting on leveling the mage until later... again - way too many things to consider here!
---
Post where they said they are using the exact same API as retail? As far as I understood it, they are basing the API on the current retail version. Doesnt mean its going to be exactly the same.
---
should probably take into account the sub growth, we will have at least 2x to 3x as many subs as release grows closer
---
Ideally there is parity or a slight shaman advantage in raid. 5-8 shaman is ideal. If 5-7 of those are resto, and you assume 2-3 druids, that‚Äôs only 3-4 priests. 
---
Having tranquil air in ranged and wind fury in melee/tank group is really nice. Having enough sham to give nearly everyone resistance auras is nice too.
---
Both are highly desired, powerful healers in vanilla. Both have a fun dps offspec and are good as pvp healers.
---
only as horde. wf makes 2h warrior viable.
---
U
---
those 20mins just for eating
---
Im somewhat struggling with this myself.  It would be very, very nice to have the 'safety' of having a guild going into launch, especially an active one for doing stuff while leveling.  On the other hand, choices so far have seemed kind of limited...and i dont want to 'compromise' on what i want just to have that guild on launch day.
---
There was finally one that posted with the right raid times a couple weeks ago on the discord, but the name was *so fucking stupid*, and then they ended up changing the raid days after a week or two, so it wouldnt work for me anyways.  I kind of fear that will happen with a lot of guilds as more people join or whatever, and i'd hate to get to know a group of people and then have it change last minute and not be viable for me.
---
Side note: I cannot believe how *few* guilds at this point seem to be doing the traditional Tuesday/Thursday, with maybe a Sunday raid at 8~11 (some flexibility there) Eastern.  Those times always worked perfect for me in Central time, and when i started in Wrath it seemed like the 'main'/'normal'/'default' raid time.
---
&gt;Obviously im talking about initial feel of a class description and what class you like the most.
---
You are missing my point - the description does not necessarily help with how the class actually feels to play. The mage description makes it sound like you are weaving different kinds of elements and pure arcane energy to destroy your enemy. In reality you just spam frostbolt.
---
&gt;For me at the end of the day its all about how you feel as a person,what class that you identify with the most.
---
For *you*, but it's a minority that just want a class they can identify with and then does not care about mechanics and actual gameplay. Of course general theme of a class is important to many, but not so much that you will be okay with gameplay mechanics you hate. 
---
&gt; Sry to hear mage PVE gameplay is boring to you but it still doesnt change the class is what you identify with if you like playing a wizard type of class.
---
It does very much change that. I like a wizard type of class. The lore of WoW mages fits, the description fits, the artwork fits. The problem is, all of that does not *matter* if I don't feel like that when actually *playing* the game. I don't feel like all the artwork, the description or lore of a mage because of how the actual gameplay is. I feel like a guy throwing slush ice on the enemy.
---
This is my whole point, the description does not reflect how the class feels - at least not all. For rogue I think the description does, so that might be why you think it works.
---
Gameplay mechanics are just really important to a lot of people. It is poor advice to say people should fully ignore how a class actually feels to play and just pick based on a description that tells nothing but the general theme and very vaguely what you can do while giving no hints of all the core mechanics involved and in some cases actually making you think the class will play in one way when i reality it plays much differently.

He still has to get approval.  Not saying he‚Äôs a good or bad guy, just saying he‚Äôs not the only good or bad guy involved in these decisions.  Even IF he had been 100% Gung Ho for Classic Wow, he still could have been shot down by his superiors.
---
Imagine a VR version for VIVE/OCCULUS/PSVR with full HOTAS support.
---
They had a small "demo" for the PSVR with Battlefront 2015 I believe.
---
Sadly, we'll probably have to wait for new leadership at Lucasfilm for something decent out of the Star Wars brand.
---
I think it's a colloquial expression for "Am I in the minority here?". Don't take it so literally.
---
You cant.
---
They're usually 40 at least in the US and it would attract and retain more players if they didn't have to pay.  Plus look how much they push the cash shop.  Could easily stock that with more goodies per expansion.
---
Can you tell me where's Mandrik's wife though?
---
I spent maybe 1 months deciding between warrior or mage. I spent \~2 months deciding if I want to be human or orc.
---
I'm glad this time I had time to think on it since it is such a huge investment to level in classic. See you in Azeroth!
---
We had a full decked out ret pally trying to prove his worthy in a naxx run, 300 dps on patch lol, while rogues and warriors are pulling close to 1k.
---
Yea, they are useless in raid environment, 
---
Too bad that‚Äôs the classic you are getting. Can‚Äôt wait for tbc, the only ‚Äúbest‚Äù wow experience. 
---
Dual talent, arena, better raid setup etc. classic still runner up though.
---
That would mean blizzard at aiming at what, 12k pop cap on servers?
---
2000 in northshire is just a pserver phenomenon.
---
You should ask r/buildapcforme or check out r/laptops
---
Human priest / Troll priest are the way to go. 
---
Femme troll, too: posture is important. 
---
As a priest everyone will want you in their group from wailing caverns through mc and naxx. 
---
As a tanking warrior you will be in even more demand until you‚Äôre prebis and looking to raid. Then finding a spot can be tough. 
---
Healing and tanking are far and away the most engaging vanilla raid roles. So at least you‚Äôre on the right train of thought!
---
This is a noob question but i know dwarf and i saw a battered chest on the mini map but when i went to it seemed to be underground do i need a spade or something?
---
Invest in an item called nightfall and you might get invited to raids beyond being a buff bot.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. Tokens are soulbound and can only be put on the AH. That way, players can‚Äôt give them away for free.
---
As a former priest in a top guild on Pserver I can tell you discipline is the best.
---
Casters will bow to your wishes just for that sweet PI to help them top the meter.
---
It's the only thing that will differentiate their damage from their pair which mean they will give you consumables, help you farm gold,... just so you can be their PI bitch for the raid night.
---
The only spellhit you need as healer is 3 percent for pvp purposes (spellhit checks every spell that is offensive - dispels, crown control etc doesn't need to do actual damage).
---
In pve environment the only spellhit for healers that I can think of is Instructor Razuvius fight in Naxx where priests need to cast mind control, which *must* land successfully or it leads to a quick wipe.
---
Priest is AWESOME...but pretty rough leveling on a PvP server and at 60 as a holy lives a pretty rough life at 60 on a PvP server unless you love standing around capital citiies waiting for instance groups to form.
---
Tbf, he's not really wrong.
---
Spells have 17% chance to miss vs raidbosses, but you can never get rid of the last 1% miss so 16% is the hitcap. I believe hitcap for spells in PvP is like 3% though.
---
As for resists thats reduced by spell penetration only. Its just confusing since the game displays both spell misses and spell resists as resists.
---
"The pay-to-play version of *RuneScape* was first [announced](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Update:Premium_RuneScape_service_coming_soon!) on [4 October](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/4_October) [2001](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/2001), and [fully instated](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/Update:Latest_RuneScape_News_(27_February_2002)) on [27 February](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/27_February) [2002](https://runescape.fandom.com/wiki/2002)."  
---
You claim to be a big fan of Runescape and you couldn't bother making a simple fucking google.
---
From a developers book or something, basically it was designed in a week. Might have taken longer to actually build and code obviously.
---
Hi, /u/bwaclawc
---
Bubble healing wasn‚Äôt invented in classic. Atonement, shields and penance just don‚Äôt exist. Whether you‚Äôre disc or holy, you‚Äôre going to be mousing over or targeting allies and casting a direct heal on them.
---
Discipline tree sort of focuses on mana efficiency. 
---
Holy more or less focuses on throughput.
---
GREAT POST SIGGE!
---
I will play as my first ever character. Night Elf Rogue. Don't even care about theory-crafting yet.
---
Part of the issue is that Nintendo marketing seems to be a bit limited in the west. 
---
If you are interested in finding what is available I would suggest trying to find some Nintendo centric youtube channels just to get an overview of what is available.
---
You assume players actally care enough to look up correct statweights. A player using the kind of addon you are proposing are exactly the kind of players I wouldnt trust to find accurate information like statweights.
---
The players who DO know, would not need an addon, since they are likely basing their gear choices on more than just pure character power, and will balance every stat towards their needs and playstyle to begin with.
---
This addon is just going to cause more harm than good and I really hope it wont become a thing.
---
Yet this has been experimented with on private server and shown to not be a big problem. I played during Vanilla and remember it not being an issue either. You could go to servers with low populations or servers with very high populations (even with original cap) back in the day and the resource scarcity never had the impact most people are concerned with. Consider also that the differential between low/high populations back then was greater than 2x. One could argue that Blizzard specifically tuned their spawn rates to accommodate high pop realms but I really doubt it.
---
The stronger argument is familiarity within realms as caps are increased. For authenticity, you want familiarity as an argument for original population cap. Not spawn rates and resource scarcity.
---
If you're in a instance or BG with randos...there are still players that when they get PI, it startles them because they don't realize what the effect sound was or what it's doing, it only lasts 12 seconds so it's better to coordinate with someone who knows what the heck kinda gift you're giving them or use it yourself lol

How are hunters viewed in raiding? It's one of the few classes I have yet to play at end game and I've always heard they're good levelers and farmers but usually the "best dps" discussions mentions locks or mages. How many are usually brought to a raid?
---
That's terrible advice for people who have very clear well-defined end-game goals. The whole point of an MMO is there's other people out there and their expectations and the core game mechanics will effect what you can and can't do in the game.
---
If you get a raid leader that knows anything about priests, they will want Discs along with holys.
---
Rolling on a PVE server so am going to take my time leveling in all those zones I avoided like the plague and actually taking the time to read the story text and level without an add on like questie.
---
Please stay in retail.
---
Can you imagine the infections this would give?
---
How would you fill out a tri spec talent tree at level 60 with decent gear then? Is it worth going deep shadow like I did or am I missing some key disc/holy talent?
---
Raiding in vanilla is almost incomparable to raiding in any other era.
---
Vanilla raiding is more about management and preparation. 
---
Current raiding is more about individual performance and execution. 
---
BC was my favorite era to raid because it had elements of both. You still had resource management and meaningful threat management, you still had a lot of min/maxing you could do in terms of group composition, but the fights asked more of the individual and there was a wider spectrum of viable specs to play. 
---
I don't at all like the fact that there are many specs in vanilla which are utterly useless in raids. I don't think comical imbalance is essential to the enjoyment of the era.
---
I believe the argument is that it's grindy for WoW. People who didn't play until later expansions were coddled by the ever shrinking XP system. I'm sure RuneScape is another monster, but most are going to compare to current retail WoW.
---
As tossberg97 said - swapping to sword and board in defensive stance will allow you to survive burst combos from rogues, other warriors, hunters etc.  then you can swap back to a big 2hander and start damaging again etc.
---
But, if you want to play a Warrior or a Paladin you should play what you want.
---
Ah yes, the game of thrones subreddit.
---
Really depends of the fight but generally you'll mostly be using slow heal because it's more mana efficient and heal sniping is for the paladin. Some fight will requires AoE healing, in some you'll be heal sniping too with flash heal.
---
It also depends on who you're healing, are you charged to heal the raid, the main tank, off-tank?
---
raid healing need more fast heal while tank healing need more slow heal.
---
All in all you want to minimize your mana consumption by downranking and using slow heal.
---
Check this site if you want more info about priest healing, it has a lot of good info

2-3 Hunters are usually brought to 40 man raids. They are mainly there for tranq shot and kiting.
---
I‚Äôm planning to skip it and just grind it out, it‚Äôs not going to be worth it timewise.
---
If things were chill, then I used a Rank 4 heal quite a bit if I could afford the wait time vs. flash heal and it was very cheap.  If there were those OH SHIT moments then flash heal.  Generally speaking you are trying to focus on NOT HEALING and getting that mana to regen. That's the real trick is knowing when to take a break for healing to get mana back IMO. Also Inner Focus helps with that, but it really depends.  I'd say it's actually diverse because if your target is 1/2 dead and heading down you're gonna GH, etc.

"I'll give you 1000g in classic if you trade me (the gold amount) a token in retail"
---
Fear Ward my friend.  (Dwarf is pretty dang good).
---
^ fanart is cool. I draw sometimes too. I recognise artists want their art to be seen. However a lot of subs turn into nothing but mediocre/just fanart/unfunny fanfiction comics and then nothing else. I prefer these "halp what class" posts over that. At least you can potentially learn something new from discussions even if youve heard the topic a hundred times.
---
At the end of the day I don't think you can ever go wrong with playing as a tank. Sure, the more hardcore guilds already have their dedicated tanks but there will be many more guilds formed and imo pugs will be much more common due to the average WoW knowledge being much higher. Many Classic fights also required 3-4 tanks depending. Also, you have to account for attrition through leveling a warrior so there may be less competition.
---
Are you me? Cause that was exactly my plan
---
Yeah, I actually think leveling a priest is pretty easy if you stick to one mob at a time and try to stick to mobs your own level or green. Very easy and efficient except for getting ganked a ton.
---
The subreddit grows around 500/day. So around 150K by release (in July)?
---
But the 4M current WoW subscriber number was very generous. It easily might be just half of that.
---
The numbers are obviously very approximate. Overall it doesn't change the picture. A few hundred thousand extra subscribers, resulting in less than 1% revenue growth for Activision Blizzard. Classic is very important to us, but basically an (admittedly profitable) fanservice for Blizzard.
---
2000 is such an exaggeration. No sharding.
---
I‚Äôll say the game where 2-3 mobs is death and I have to do a corpse is easy compared to the games where even 1 mob can mean death followed by a naked corpse run and probably losing most your shit anyways.
---

Yeah but at least posting here you have a chance to for people to correct the misinformation rather than google giving you some locked forum thread from 5 years ago where nobody can respond and correct anything.

PI the caster? No sir, I PI the rogue with Fiery Weapon enchant to boost his damage
---
It's mainly a few pieces of crafted gear, like red mageweave.
---
In the end they will all end up playing Beast Master hunters. Then wondering why they never get into groups.
---
Because you didn't actually say anything. He clearly wanted to ask a person and not Google. This is the equivalent of someone asking for help in game and being told to go Google it instead of interacting with a community of people.
---
These are fantastic.  Well done!
---
At Max level every body is going to be wearing the same outfit as every other member of thier class, until naxx releases 
---
Also why do you believe that transmogrification eliminates outfit variety?
---
This happened yesterday and its the least exciting news possible.
---
Twill gear is an absolute fashion statement, definitely will be ‚Äúin‚Äù for summer 2019.
---
Priests are a very strong class and fun to play. If you‚Äôre on their side you love them but against you hate them. I leveled a 60 dwarf and had a blast melting faces and being support for groups
---
Yes because I‚Äôm sick of this thread. I‚Äôm done talking nicely after the the 5th person told me to fuck off to retail and harassed me.
---
And no I said he is being self centered, which he is. Which isn‚Äôt a personal attack and doesn‚Äôt disprove that you came in here only reading my post in reply to him (Poorly, evidently), and then came out the gate very obviously not wanting an honest discussion.
---
And yes, you are acting like a kid, you refuse to read the other posts and come out swinging and being abrasive. 
---
And no I said your argument is a slippery slope. 
---
You seem to fail to grasp that your argument is flawed and has been posted multiple times already.
---
Al'ar was massively nerfed in both tank requirements, damage and raid mechanics. Only a few guilds have killed him pre nerfs.
---
Getting my glaives from BT sent me into overdrive, nothing has ever compared to that rush since.

Mods!!
---
Remember to thank your healer
---
Similar story for most shaman I imagine. What I liked doing was raiding as resto during progression, then start collecting enhance gear when no one need them anymore. By the time I had a full enhance set (mostly for pvp) I'd join raid as enhance for the easy clears.  It gave me a good variety of game play through all the raid releases.
---
Unless you're competing in the top 100 of your region, mythic raiding doesn't require "insane perfection". 
---
Overall for the average player , vanilla raiding required a lot more time commitment than any other era. 
---
Basically modern raiding requires more individual accountability and performance but doesn't require you to put in much work unless you're in a very high-end guild. 
---
I raid 3-4 hours a week in a very casual heroic guild. I don't level my neck, I don't farm consumables, I do one +10 a week for my cache. If I put in 10% more effort I could play a similar schedule in a mythic guild. 
---
There is no other era in WoW I could get away with being as casual as I currently am. In BC / Wrath I did the whole four nights a week guild pushing for server firsts , and when I wasn't raiding I was doing shit to be prepared for it. 
---
You can say a lot of bad things about retail, but its ability to cater to casual players is unparalleled.
---
I'm waiting till launch simply to see what guilds are actually active at the times I'm online and playing. I don't want just an active guild, but an active guild that is online at the same time as me.
---
No, Elemental Shaman can PvP extremely well. Neither ele or spriest does well in PvE.
---
Wasn't gruul somwhat of a gearcheck, at least when it came to DPS?
---
Just depends honestly. Top tier #1 on server guild? Doubt it, you‚Äôd have to be the #1 hunter on the server. Casual raising guild? For sure, you‚Äôll be able to find a group
---
God I love these! Keep up the good work!
---
Yeah but we will call them artifacts.
---
Throw eggs at him!
---
I also find another issue is loading screens and massive walls. Sure wow had zone boundaries but they never felt as jaring as some of the other MMOs. Also loading screens between every zone just turn me off of any MMO.

None of the above.  29/11/11 is good but not laid out like that. 0/30/21 would be better than all of these
---
After the nerfs they were absurdly easy - they were basically buggy messes before making them impossible. My guild cleared tempest keep literally within the first week of being in there it was a fucking joke (post nerf obviously). BT had some interesting mechanics but wasn't overly challenging. SWP totally flipped the paradigm and was fucking impossible.

Hopefully it‚Äôs not nighttime during the day like it has been in retail.
---
Reading an article is interacting with community even if it is 10 years old. Someone put a lot of time and effort to explain the topic. I'm not going copy that person's work. It's a waste of time. Pointing to the location of the article is important in my opinion.
---
ya I played a Warrior as ARMS in vanilla. Did i get a Raid spot? No. Did I get a raid spot when it was on farm? Yes. Dungeons I found to be easy no matter what depending on the person. I did not run into many people wanting ONLY a few class. Most just took w/e they could to start it up. I'd just play w/e you want unless you want to raid.
---
"Always thank your healer!" -Muradin, HOTS
---
&gt; previous expansions. 
---
Please tell me all about these expansions prior to Vanilla.
---
So its a type of progression as well. Interesting.
---
But you didn't point to an article, you said "use the internet" what if this guy wanted to talk to people?
---
Have the played Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment?
---
This is not how supply and demand works.
---
Higher demand, same supply -&gt; Traded items become more expensive -&gt; Gold becomes less valuable -&gt; A lot of gold farming methods become much less efficient -&gt; etc. etc. etc.
---
TLDR; Your understanding of economics is wrong.
---
I dunno.
---
Possibly:  Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Warlock, Priest, Paladin, or Druid
---
Definitely not:  mage, shaman
---
Likely: Hunter if I can't decide just because easy, farming, PvP
---
I don't understand it either.  Where I live (US) it is also normal to think of seasons as occurring on their defined dates.
---
Sure, but it was nice to be able to just tell exactly what someone was wearing without the facade of transmog masking it. There would also be a ton of people rolling on gear that isn‚Äôt an upgrade for them just for the appearance.
---
In response to your edit: The people saying ~98-11 are correct, you are not.  If you cut it off at 05 you quite literally cut off the foundations of most modern mega franchises like Battlefield, Warcraft, Call of Duty, etc.
---
Yep - you hit the nail on the head. Game developers now focus on how much money they can make off of a game, rather than make a rich gaming experience they can be proud of. 
---
I've honestly thought about getting a PS4 just for the exclusives that have proven to be very good games.
---
Um? Most guild already have an idea on what kind of server they are rolling on be it PvE/PvP/RP and so on. If the guild you are looking at cant even think of one just leave it already lol.
---
But there‚Äôs going to be a lot more mages which you might also want to take into account
---
That's still being a buff bot, just a better one.
---
Yes, definitely   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxRGsh0oZdxtcc0Vx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxRGsh0oZdxtcc0Vx) 
---
Have "spell power and healing" gear to put on solo to replace to pure +healing gear.
---
Priests do fine solo except for being gank food on a PvP server. Better to pair up, but if you have to kill, priests do just fine IMO. Buy some water off of a mage and just go nuts.
---
Good job, you have convinced me. I forgot how economics applied to a simulated world for a second there. If only there was an experiment that could validate this idea.
---
Well, he gets to hit stuff
---
&gt;There will probably be more holy priests than pallies in a given raid anyway.
---
If you're talking about horde raids, then yes, that's very likely....
---
5 realms per region would make sense if it was 2 pvp, 2 pve, 1 rp. pls blizzard give rppve
---
High fidelity of old textures is not the same as new textures.
---
Just go find a guild that's playing on a server you will be on. Like NA-Pve or NA-RPPvP. Once that's out of the way look for when they play the most or when they will raid. If the times match up look to see what the goals are for the Guild and so on. Won't hurt t join on and leave later if they are not for you.
---
I honestly can't believe the launch wasn't in line with school ending.
---
It was like that for every single.new server that launched, it was the most fun leveling experience I had. The increased spawn rates made those first 20 levels just absolute mob smashing madness. Hundreds of people running around, mobs and quest objectives spawning as fast as they fall.
---
It was an extremely memorable part of the leveling experience on new servers.
---
Most are already aware of the popular items for the cookie cutter statweights already and without putting in any effort to search for different items the popular ones will be swarmed anyhow.  
---
And the players who will be balancing stats towards their needs would have a tool to   find those pieces without having to comb through pages of classicdb.ch and calculate pieces manually.
---
People dont understand that there will be gold selling regardless. Just like the war on drugs. People will get ahead buying gold no matter what. You absolutley cannot stop it unless blizzard highly endorces a dteict ban policy. Until i see or hear otherwise, arguing against a token is just arguing for account theft, chineese farmers and an overall worse game imo
---
Hi!
---
If you plan to hardcore raid, then you‚Äôre lockes to the frames of ‚ÄùPaladins heal, shammys heal, druids heal, warriors have to dps as fury‚Äù etc. 
---
But if you plan to raid casually, then you should just play whatever the fuck you want. 
---
There‚Äôs going to be loads of raiding guilds that are going to let you raid as whatever specc you want. 
---
It‚Äôs just that if you‚Äôre aiming towards hardcore raiding, sadly your choices are limited. 
---
Hopefully this helped a little bit. Maybe I just pointed out the obvious. 
---
Have a good one!
---
At what point was it implemented that it decreased after a certain amount of time not doing one?
---
The only issue that exists is that grinding with a warrior is that warrior is a real gear dependant class. It's proven that grinding does not gear you compared to questing. Make sure to do specific quests that reward useful warrior gear, or use the gold on your main to buy your warrior a shiny new grind toy every 10 levels. 
---
No class experiences changes in damage like a warrior with a new weapon
---
I'm playing a prot paladin, I'll group with you :3
---
They'll make more on CoD in a week than Classic WoW brings in in a year.
---
Private servers have so much shit wrong you really can't use them as evidence for anything.
---
It also requires farming freaking pummelers just like feral dps :|
---
Ret is not effective in PvP?  Did you actually play vanilla?  I destroy people in pvp.
---
Narrator: "He did."
---
I‚Äôm guessing about 2/3 will try it and only about 1/4 of active users will stick with it
---
Shadow question: how is using inner focus on CD with devouring plague not the ideal use of both of those abilities? Is the crit chance with MB really that valuable or is it just assuming the raid doesn‚Äôt have a spare debuff spot?
---
Just before TBC was released, a guild on my server (EU, Earthen Ring) started offering free boosts through BWL for 10 folk at a time - I got the impression that they were just nice guys, they'd cleared all the content umpteen times, so they helped folk get the stuff they couldn't get as they were either not in a raiding guild, or not in a raiding build (e.g. me as a feral druid). Other folk sold runs though.
---
I got a few bits of my tier stuff which will still be in my bank on my long neglected vanilla character, and a lot of good memories seeing the bits I never thought I'd see.
---
SHARDING BAD
---
holy priests get the AQ20 quest 1hand scepter with +95 healing, which is pretty much free for anyone who puts in the effort to grind exalted with Cenarion Hold.
---
I don‚Äôt think it will be that high. And I think most people who will be active on it will also still be active with new school. I don‚Äôt think this is a OSRC situation
---
spare debuff spot
---
I also played when new servers started (e.g. Haomarush EU, started in 2005) but then there was long queues. I remember putting something on my keyboard to run in a circle to not get AFK logged out and having to stand in queue again. The queues reduced the pressure on the starting zones, so while there was a lot of people there, it wasn't that bad.  The servers used now are significantly upgraded and can take a lot more people without needing queues so just letting the masses in without sharding will not be the same thing as in vanilla. No one is saying starting zones should be empty, they are saying it shouldn't be 10x more than how it was on new servers in vanilla.
---
If the population cap is 3000 and you have everyone split evenly among the 8 races, that's 375 people per race. Orc/Troll and Gnome/Dwarf share starting zones, so those could have have ~750 in their starting zone. 2000 is an exaggeration, but even 200 people in a zone sharing the first spawns seems a bit crazy.
---
I don't know the programming and mechanics behind the sharding, but if they could set the shard limits to 75-150 people, would that make everyone happy?
---
No, it‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt take a joke.
---
Interesting- was always told to PI a mage. If I priest again I‚Äôll have to try that, thx
---
Hi, /u/wotad
---
Out of curiosity what did you find not fun about Shamans?
---
Nothing is confirmed regarding battle groups.
---
That was me in actual vanilla
---
Thanks guys, I'd be lying if I said I don't feel somewhat vindicated :)
---
That SS is pserver cancer, launch wasn't like that (cause of the 50+ servers)
---
Not sure about you, but IMO its a good thing that big part of community are having hard time to pick a class, that means every single class has something to bring to the table and something "negative" about them. I have fun forming dungeon groups and think what they bring group and what we might be missing if we dont pick a certain class.
---
Not homogenized like retail, where every class can pretty much do the same stuff, it gets dull super quick and lacks the fantasy I deeply crave.
---
Power Infusion is pretty sick
---
Better be sometime in July because where I live summer ends at the end of July as far as I'm concerned.
---
Wait I thought that tokens actually don't generate gold. As far as I understood them they are traded between players.
---
A player can buy a token with money from Blizzard and then sell it on the AH for in-game gold. No gold generated. Isn't that how they work?
---
This just looks like the standard holy healing spec to me. Without wand spec or spirit tap, won't this have pretty bad downtime? I get that it's good for AoE farming like lashers, but that's not going to be available at launch.
---
What is the rotation supposed to be solo for this build? Where would you farm with this?
---
Vanilla didn't do increased spawns and classic won't either. So it's less monster smashing mayhem, and more stranding around waiting for spawns like a dickhead.
---
&gt; Yet this has been experimented with on private server and shown to not be a big problem.
---
All the big private servers I've played on had dynamic spawns for mobs + herbs to deal with the larger playerbase. 
---
Where can I read about the experiments showing it wasn't a problem?
---
I'm picking hunter solely so I can get rhokdelar. That is it.
---
This is pretty accurate. Even Naxx is easy compared to modern Mythic raids. But the small group dungeons are way harder than modern day small group dungeons, just because you are appropriately punished for mistakes. The key to Vanilla is raiding is easy, people are hard.
---
Don't be a douche.
---
That's a very good point.
---
Do you ever stop being a petty little wannabe-knowitall, who thinks hes clever because he remembers details from a 14 year old videogame less relevant to the world than the smell of my latest fart?
---
Later vanilla also me. Warrior first then hunter. If it wasnt for my priest buddy getting me into dungeons I would have never learned the greatness of kiting back then.
---
Been waiting 13 years to play this and due to my unique situation I'm unable to play private servers. Please Blizzavision, make it sometime in July. Fucking slowly growing white beard hairs waiting for this. Losing hair on the top of my head as well.
---
There have been a few that have done it. I haven't played in Pservers in a while but I remember being a part of one.
---
Vanilla servers most likely all had the same cap = Same spawn rates. So yes, the economy on those servers automatically adjusted. But the comment you initially replied to was not about automatic adjustment, but whether increasing server caps compared to vanilla was a good idea, as that would mean you would have to raise spawn rates as well, to -&gt;&gt;&gt; maintain the vanilla feel &lt;&lt;&lt;-
---
Stop undead shaming.
---
Like if you're short on spirit, being able to search for the BiS for spirit, but also to take into account other stats. 
---
I like this, you sound smart.
---
They definitely wont be. Classic has a lot of gear variety, as does any version of WoW tbh.
---
He never said transmog eliminates outfit variety, only that without it people look ridiculous due to collecting many different pieces from many different instances and thus there is little coherence.
---
Can someone tell me how rogues are on Alliance are humans the best for PVE and dwarfs for PVP? What is the dps difference.
---
Welcome to classic :-)
---
I cant recall much of my vanilla days but i remember finding it very difficult to get into a good guild that raided consistently bc i was an undergeared arms warrior.  When i went prot, my prospects went thru the roof and i was able to get into a decent raiding guild(albiet it was an Alt guild for a prominent guild on the server).  I finally started getting loot from MC and BWL.  Back then, raiding seemed wayyy more challenging given how many players were needed to clear MC and BWL and all the requirements to be effective.  I think it also had alot to do with the fact that most guilds were past BWL and still struggling with AQ and then Naxx.  I remember having convos with high end players and it usually went along the lines of "arms warriors are not high priority and ranged DPS, healers/tanks were priority.  So when you roll a warrior or paladin, be prepared to be asked to change your spec to fit a mold. 
---
This time around it could be different. Raiding could be potentially easier and faster.  The player base is more skilled at gaming in general and more competitive.  So with all that said, this time around im making a fucking warlock bc i want raid leaders to blow up my chat. I dont mind farming soulstones either.   My end goal is to clear Naxx, then i can finally rest.
---
What actual advice does anyone have in regards to being a guild's designated Shadow Priest? 
---
I'll be finding a guild I like with my buddy and putting in the farm time and commitment it takes to be a good raider in Classic but anything specific or general would be cool.
---
(I have done some hardcore raiding before in WotLK and Cata, but I'll just be committed to whatever the guild I settle in with does though)
---
Warlock is easier to level and will probably find grouping for leveling in dungeons easier since they have the only summon for some time. 
---
Mages shine in pvp late game, unless you watch drake dog.
---
* Hard time handling with elites/limited farming potential - not as tanky as bear, not as kiting-capable as a mage. Like there is a video showing shaman farming ZG with totems. Many things can be done but it's "not fun", harder to pull of/takes to much time.
---
* Elemental base spell deals nature damage - often things will be immune or quite resistant to it - some elementals, some plant-alike creatures I wanted to farm for consumables or other profits.
---
My current shaman just does fishing/herbs/potions/raids while for FRESH Classic I want to go places and instances and farm mobs, do some AoE pulls, see what rare or maybe even epic drops etc. But I still want to have a healer backup - druid is no 1, while shaman is still there on the list. If there will be much higher need for raid healing or that totem utility then maybe I pick shaman for that alt instead of a druid (although that feral tanking option is quite tempting, while druid Healing Touch isn't bad either, just ST instead of chain heals).
---
Girl on the far right is also me trying to finish my degree with a wife, kids, and fulltime job.
---
Frankly I'd rather you keep Classic footage separated from modern.
---
I don't play retail and have no basis (nor interest) to judge what happens in a BFA pvp vid.
---
Also disgusting neck beards. Can't forget that.
---
yeah same here.  I loved a lot about star trek online for example, but you were constantly flitting between load screens to various little instances.  In that game it was inevitable, but it still makes everything feel disconnected and sort of 'lonely'.  Ground environments in that game felt like you were in a holodeck simulation rather than on worlds most of the time
---
tbh. alot of caster classes have talents that increase hit chance quite a bit...for example, Warlocks get 'Suppression' which increases Affliction SPell Hitchance by 10% at 5/5
---
It's him for real LOL
---
I mean, I see your point. What class should I play though???
---
We just 25-manned it down there, killed everything in site, grabbed some coin and then waited while everyone else ran through.  Easy with 20/25 in BRD at one time.  But many of us were so excited to SEE MC, oh gosh, those giants for the first time just standing at the doorway were AWESOME.
---
I should have worded that better. The content itself would all be classic, it is just the intro that would include anything current. Thanks for the feedback though I'll reevaluate
---
lol, yup it is!  Spirit tap is SHIT except leveling with tons of spirit gear. I tried a bunch of specs and always came back to just plain holy/disc and bought some mana pots and water. If you want to farm lashers you better have a huge mana pool and prob want disc w/ holy nova for that specific. I‚Äôd rather group up and farm.  Sometimes I‚Äôd go farm mobs in WPL when bored but it‚Äôs pretty ass. You will make the most farming gold doing orb runs in Strath so just do that and stay holy. Just my opinion though
---
Strongly leaning towards Warlock.  I played one to about level 40 and loved it.  How does it play at end game and pvp?
---
I see OSRS is leaking, except in there it's to protect the account from being recovered.
---
Stop calling it harassment when people argue with you or call you names on the internet and grow up. I‚Äôve read your replies and you are consistently the one who chooses to be an ass first and now you‚Äôre crying about it happening to you. Stop lashing out with your own insecurities. 
---
Blizzard made their stance and that‚Äôs what we wanted. A firm stance. Now you want to loosen it because you don‚Äôt like a part of vanilla.
---
We‚Äôve been fighting for Classic to become a reality for a long time and we will keep fighting to keep it exactly as it was until the day we get to play it. 
---
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they implement this retail feature into WoW? Hey they got that feature, would it be so bad to also add this? What about this?‚Äù 
---
Even if it seems harmless at the start, blizzard needs to have a firm stance on this so they can work with a clear guideline and not get lost in the fray of complaints and requests. When they said the same, they mean the same. Don‚Äôt give them reason to second guess this just so you can have new character models. 
---
You need to look at the bigger picture.
---
If it's your fav class go Shaman, if my buddy didn't want to roll Ally as much as I wanted Horde, I'd be a Shaman. It feels great to play, and you have a few more options outside of healing which is always nice to have.
---
That said, IMO the actual healing is the most fun as Priest, by far, and I much prefer Shadow over Ele
---
What does the WoD release have to do with anything? They said they expected a fall release... and it released in the fall.
---
&gt;Are people just making baseless assumptions
---
Well yeah you are on Reddit.
---
Ignore him. Hes just doing this to be annoying.
---
This sub is really shitty. I need it for the news though.
---
It's disappointing because /r/2007scape is fucking amazing. Classic wow has the same potential. Apparently wow players can't meme
---
Time to reevaluate
---
About time!  I keep checking your YT for a new one. 
---
Great work.
---
Yeah but isn't it of the active pvp players, that week, for your faction? 
---
With a 3k server cap, or even say 5k like some of the no changers want for some reason (I guess some changes as long as it matches private servers they like?) Take a perfect 50/50 faction split. That's 2.5k on your faction. If by some miracle, they ALL pvp every week (most of those, especially in phase 2, are still leveling) that is 2 R14 a week. Even 1999 players pvping for the week makes 1 R14. It was always 1 a week in vanilla.
---
If you really want to raid 2h, you'll need to roll horde. The only problem will be, all the do warriors in your raid will be rolling for the same 1 weapon in MC. Bonereavers is really the only strong viable 2h option. It can and will be competitive into or through AQ 40. Other orc/tauren warriors will start trying to pick up axes and maces.
---
As far as gearing goes, roll tank for your dungeons. You'll be able to set up the groups and ensure you are the only warrior so you can grab all or most of the dps gear as you pick up tank pieces.
---
This is all considering the fact that you would want to be a competitive raider. I'm not saying hardcore, but someone that still wants to raid all content at a decent pace.
---
Then here is a proposal:
---
Write a post in which you unload your "wisdom", instead of annoying the people arround you by being essentially the reddit-equivalent of a kindergarten child running around telling the other kids "nah uhuhhh, this is not how you eat cake, my mommy told me a waaay better way to eat, you so stupid."
---
Where I come from, kids who did that didn't eat cake, they ate what's in the sandbox instead.
---
 No ones saying you can 100% rely on private servers, but they are closer than some random dudes opinion on which class was strongest in naxx
---
Loot settings does not change this. You need 20x a quest item drop, i stead of 10x. 
---
But for me, group questing as always a prefered thing when playing with friends. Then i can be social while questing, and the social aspect of is the games strongest aspect. :)
---
If you're trying to be hardcore about it top guilds usually recruit those who hit 60 asap.
---
How many people do you think are going to be playing the game?  The numbers to support massive amounts of players that can't wait to get their hands on classic just aren't there... There are literally 7.8% of one million people in this subreddit.  That's a significantly low number.  Look up some popular and informative Classic content creators on YouTube, not a lot of views on their videos.  There are maybe a couple over 200k, some between 100k-200k and most 50kish or less views.  Massive private server population... There's 9k total people online right now for both Lights\*\*\*\* servers total.  As of 10/16/18 19% of the total accounts made had been active in the last 100 days @ 279,792, there is no cap to how many accounts you can make and its free to do so and play.  I mean, if you're thinking there are going to be 2 million people playing the game, there are about 1.7 million people unaccounted for.  Where are they?  They aren't in the reddit, they aren't watching super informative videos explaining every facet of classic mechanics, bosses, quirks, tips, class guides, leveling guides, dungeon guides, you name it its there videos.  Where are all these unaccounted for people hiding?  I do feel that 312k players is a tad on the low side but not by much really.
---
Are there generally fewer rogues on alliance than horde? I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs be slightly more demand for my class due to the lack of UD?
---
It harassment when they keep replying and constantly telling me to stick shit up my ass and fuck off to the point of having to have their comments removed/banned.
---
Also ironic since that‚Äôs literally not the case and you came out the gate being an ass. If you notice people who talk calmly and don‚Äôt make snide comments to me or attacks don‚Äôt get me going back at them. 
---
Also Blizzard has already changed shit and your making a assumptions.
---
You need to stop relying on slippery slopes and actually read the thread. I‚Äôm done talking to you. Because I can quote you multiple people who came out the gate personally attacking me but you don‚Äôt apparently see it.
---
Totally different. A fresh server being added is to help mitigate the overflow from the full servers. You get a fraction of the people jumping on there that you do *at actual launch*. 
---
Not to mention, increased spawn rates have been discussed to death, and they look terrible. Nobody else is trying to go into this cave? Good luck getting out now that mobs spawn almost immediately and you need to eat/drink after each pull. Do you want to run around killing mobs and searching for quest items? Bad idea, you're better off just camping the spawn you're on because there's 5 other people camping the rest of them. 
---
People dislike sharding because of the effect it has on the community, while it has almost zero effect on the gameplay. People dislike dynamic spawn rates because they absolutely butcher the gameplay.
---
It is a spec that tends to focus more on the PvP side where Holy focuses more on PvE. So Power Infusion and *several* talents for mana efficiency were both mentioned and obviously have PvE uses as well. But it also has things like Improved Mana Burn (makes it faster casting), and some talents that help with survivability like one that gives you Focused Casting after getting crit, ones that give you a more powerful PW: Fortitude, Inner Fire, and PW: Shield.
---
LOL no it didn't have increased spawn rates.
---
Or just dont and suffer queues
---
Yeah those points are fair but they're the absolute weak points of the Shaman class, and I feel every class has a few weak points. Shamans excel at healing/utility in groups and raids, as well as disrupting and blowing people up in PvP, so if you're not into that stuff I could see Shaman as being not fun.
---
I'm going to mitigate the aforementioned downsides of Shaman by creating a Hunter alt on a second account to farm stuff and feel OP out in the world with.
---
"Greedy fury warriors" that want to roll on a weapon that's probably upgrade for them in both pvp and pve. The fuck
---
crap wifi is.
---
wifi set up by people who know what they are doing isn't.
---
I remember when 2 new servers opened at the beginning of BC (they were the last servers to have unopened Gates of AQ I believe) and I can't remember the servers being too crazy either.
---
I played a Hunter from 1-30 across 2 days and had no problem doing quests or levelling mining up etc.
---
Not sure if those servers just weren't that popular or if respawn rates were super high or what?
---
I had my GF play a hunter recently and she is enjoying the game. Just keep it casual and before you know it she'll be raiding MC and complaining about rogues taking her gear.
---
Well let me tell you then, that is juste pure nostalgia madness, how come a game is released and you don't want to play it right away ?? Some people's way of thinking is just beyond me lol
---
&gt;It's often useful to highlight a point with a metaphor
---
Just want to point out that this was an analogy, not a metaphor. But it is a good analogy.
---
All the Priest racials are actually great. Pick your fav one. Troll is super underrated, and a bit underpopulated so you'll have that as a plus if you care about it. 
---
I wouldn't suggest it but you could go Druid, they're actually super good tanks and if you're willing to swap between kitty/bear/heals you're super valuable in a raid.
---
That said, go Priest! It'll never be better than Classic if you want to play one. Neither will Warrior, but unless you have some buddies you may have a couple rough spots in leveling and gearing up (not that Priests don't have a lot of competition...)
---
Contested / other faction on PVP servers. Flagged if manually flagged on pve servers or you attack the opposite faction that is also flagged.
---
I've been going back and forth between rogue and warrior for 3 or 4 months now.... still not sure :)
---
Engineering is best fashion.
---
That‚Äôs really sad man. What a shame.
---
On PvP servers: Flagged upon entering a contested zone, or if you assist a flagged player or npc in a friendly zone.  Or /pvp toggles it.
---
On PvE servers: only flagged upon assisting a flagged player or npc or if you toggle it with /PvP
---
LMAOOOOO
---
lol i was there.. but i decided to go ret pally.. for leveling only of course xD then i will go holy or prot depend of what the guild needs
---
1.12
---
On a PVP server you get flagged for PVP if you attack a PVP flagged opponent, enter a contested or opposite faction zone, or when you type /pvp
---
You dont get flagged for entering redridge on a pve server or for entering opposite faction territory I don't believe.
---
Amazing blue post!
---
I cant believe we waited one week and got only this :((
---
i mean... i knew what im gonna roll the day they annouced it
---
hey guys im sorta having trouble deciding what class to play
---
ive been conflicted between the warrior and the death knight in classic. on one hand i know for a fact the warrior is fun and badass to play and on the other hand the death knight starts out at level 55
---
help me out here guys, you're my only hope
---
If it is swamped in the newbie zones I might just find an open area and just grind mobs for the first ten levels. It doesn't take as long as waiting in like to kill chief sharptusk haha
---
For instance Clone 406 told me and others to fuck off, no conversation or debate, just fuck off. And we were not being rude about anything. Once he and others started that shit though, I got fed up. Especially since it‚Äôs the same damn 2 arguments that have been addressed again and again.
---
If I understand correctly, because the percentage stays the same, and only the judge damage goes up, the amount by which the judge damage goes up isn't worth the extra mana cost, which will increase your time between pulls due to drinking?
---
I never hot-keyed flash heal.  For me as holy, it was a big mana waster and I watched far too many priests go OOM using it.
---
Even before I get +heal power -- I use Heal 4 even on mages, it fills them up, tops them off.  Ditto for the hunters, and some of the rogues.  It allows me to use the lowest amount of mana in the fastest time and continue to not need to drink.  
---
Once you get used to your tank (I pugged a lot for the experience) -- you could generally figure out which rank of gheal to use on them.  Inexperienced will freak out that at 1/2 health they're not topped, but then realize that a big ol' heal has come their way.  Using the timing of gheals also leads to far less heal aggro.
---
Bread and butter:  Gheal, Heal4, renew (never at the beginning, heal aggro, or as I call it, a "touch" to let the dps know that they are on your radar for a heal), shields only when someone is aoe'ing and/or really near death and POH only at the end of a tough fight when gear and levels are dependent.
---
Fade will be your friend, a timed fade can 'bounce' a NPC from one side of the room to another.  In other words, let them \*almost\* get to you, then fade back to the tank.  Those 3 seconds, 4 seconds are sometimes life-savers.
---
PVP -- I always used gheals and heal4 in PVP, along with shields on the flag carrier / person taking the most damage.  Keep them up, and let the ranged dps do their thing.  
---
Defense, smart groups will know to use your fear as a way of CC'ing some of the mobs.  Clear a space, and continually pull them back so that you can fear safely and not pull more mobs; but usually only used in emergency or with a really talented group.  Upper BRS comes to mind as you're heading towards Drak -- pull them back into the room of the Beast, and fear as many as you need to help dps take down the mobs.  And if they come back to you after a fear, bounce them across the room with a timed fade.
---
Find good weapons and / or off-hands with spirit to help you regen -- and weapon swap to help keep your mana growing.
---
I once asked an excellent priest "how do I become a good healer?"  He said, learn via PVP.  Learn to expect the unexpected, learn to play defense, not just a weak and easy death, keep your tank(s) alive, runners alive, and always be aware -- make your screen so that you can see not just your group -- but also your surroundings.
---
I have no idea!  ...but I do remember Mankrik's wife, poor thing.. Just past a bridge and to the right!
---
OK bye, nobody will miss you.
---
I took it upon myself to use it less in raids on a private server and started  using a mouseover macro. It really wasn't too bad but those still using a decursive/detox macro had way more overall dispels cause it's instant and mindless. Should be able to do dispel assignments come classic to make things more manageable.
---
I just discovered your channel a lot of cool guides, I hope when classic comes out, that you make a guide on how to farm your own epic mount. And remember not all of us play a mage.
---
Just as a side note, I was so poor in vanilla and had no clue how to make gold beside farming Tyr's Hand, that I got rank 11 in PvP just to skip the 5k gold farm. I had T2/T2.5 gear and was running around with level 40 mount :D
---
Very important to notice that if you assist someone that is flagged with lets say a buff that will get you flagged too. I once did that in Ratchet I remember and ate shit because of it. Haha, you live and you learn.
---
Pretty sure Vanilla had dynamic spawn rates based on zone population. There is no need to change anything from 1.12. The point I was trying to make in the original reply is that there isn't any correlation between raising server population cap and changing 1.12 data. As Vanilla realms increased in number of concurrent players the market adjusted accordingly. Spawn rates don't need to be messed with.
---
DEJA VU, I HAVE SEEN THIS POLL BEFORE!
---
There were also a ton of servers at launch considering the population. It launched on a Tuesday, you had to go through an installation (actually took time back then), and on top of that the game really grew from word of mouth NOT the day 1 player base.
---
A more apt comparison would be any of expansions which were total clusterfucks for the first few levels/zones.  TBC was a nightmare to start out, WotLK they realized those issues and gave a choice of zones which helped but there were still issues, Cata again had a choice of zones but at that point phasing was a thing.
---
Can there be a 50/50?
---
They also used to offer free transfers off of overpopulated servers. Used to play on Illidan and it was a mad house, overpopulated didn't even being to describe how fucked it was.
---
Um ok this is my personal theory but I think that Chris Metzen is going to come back for the sole purpose of adding the LFR system into Classic. They are also going to add heirlooms and garrisons and phasing and void elves into Classic while they're looking at pictures of dogs dying because I think Blizzard are nazis and hate us gamers
---
hit or miss, janna took the kids, y'all
---
now I'm burnin down Stratholme, ain't got no will to live, y'all
---
gonna kill my Dad and move to Northrend, y'all
---
won't be a raid boss until 2008, y'all
---
Not entirely sure about the dps difference, but I believe Human is best in PvE because of sword specialization, and Dwarf in PvP because of stoneform.
---
They expect a lot of people playing early that will not play much after release day or first week...etc. I honestly think they do need to aim up towards 10k pop. Within a month at least 50% of those people will be back on retail for the most part. But this is why I don't envy blizz on this rollout. 
---
It's quite a guessing game to determine what cap is needed early for a stable server months down the road. The falloff for classic will be greater that vanilla when it was a new game. And people who do stop not likely replaced by new people discovering a game for the first time that has now been out so long.
---
Except there‚Äôs a lot more new stuff in newer Pokemon titles than CoD or Sports games.
---
if you commit to the pvp grind and get rank 13, i dont see why someone wouldnt take you as the designated Spriest, most of the best gear for Spriest is the epic pvp gear.
---
You were told right ;) PI is best used on a mage even tho it affects fiery weapon, but any rogue using fiery weapon enchant doesn't deserve a PI
---
Depends if your holidays involve snow in any way.
---
Where is the "Even mix of both" option?
---
I have full time classes this fall, am a work study at my school, and looking for an additional job at the ER.
---
...But Classic is coming out. This picture is my life.
---
you wouldnt use it on raids it would fall off the boss almost instantly, but on 5 man dungeons or ganking sure use it on cd
---
Yes, but that doesn't mean there's thousands of people hitting the server the day of release, flooding all the new areas.
---
Free transfers means you're moving a higher level character over... so literally completely different and has zero bearing on first day problems, at all. It's a completely irrelevant and moot point.
---
Really funny expression on Gorak, very good! What level is he now?
---
Considering how it‚Äôs generally thought to rival WoW, I would say FF14 disagrees with that sentiment.
---
I want to believe.
---
A good example is the moonbrook escort quest in Westfall was a favorite for horde because the alliance characters would heal and buff the escort npc, flagging themselves.
---
I'm sorry, have never seen it before and since I speak with only PvP fans, as a PvE player, I felt a bit alone so I asked the reddit community.

Unfortunately that site is blocked at work and categorized as "sex". No idea how it got that way but alas, I will need to check this out at home lol.

Check what you're most eager to do first then
---
TBC certainly made raiding and the dungeon experience in general better, no doubt about that. The first raids were a much better introduction to raiding. The higher tier raids had more intresting mechanics and bosses. Raiding was less about consumables and more about coordination. Also gearing and classes were more balanced. Even though there existed a min-max meta, raiding was less time consuming (even though it was harder) and less gear dependand, so more and more "off-specs" were actually worthwhile.
---
But they started to mess up many things and moved away from RPG to what ever genre WoW is today.
---
* Flying mounts de-emphasized the world content.
---
* Arenas completely sucked out wPvP and put it into instanced content.
---
* Gear became ridiculously shiny and ugly, moving away from the fantasy genre.
---
* They started to move away from titles being PvP related, which watered down their meaning.
---
* They made old-world gear and progression completely irrelevant, how epic would it have been if TBC was a continuous progression from vanilla content?
---
* De-emphasis of crafting being about tradeing by increasing the BoP crafted items.
---
* Nerfing of many interesting vanilla items and moving to more and more streamlined "stat piles".
---
* Heavily guided open world experience with daily quests instead of putting emphasis on economy.
---
In retail there is an item in the blizzard store you can buy called a "WoW token" for $19.99. Using the token grants you 30 days of game time. The token can be sold via a special tab on the AH for a fluctuating rate of gold depending on your server, you do not get to set the price but can view it before buying the token. The token can only be transferred once (i.e. tokens bought via the AH cannot be resold). The token can also be redeemed for $14.99 Blizzard store balance allowing you to effectively (and legally) convert WoW gold into stuff like new WoW expansions, the blizzard store mounts, hearthstone packs, or even other games on the blizzard store (there was a huge spike in price when destiny 2 went up for pre-order).
---
The idea is to combat goldselling websites by offering a legal avenue to do it while also letting players who play a lot or are good at goldmaking to effectively play the game for "free" but buying tokens. The relevance with classic has to do with the fact that retail and classic share the same subscription which means retail players can play classic at no additional cost and classic players can turn their retail gold into "free" game time if they wish. I don't have any problems with the token/system but do not want or expect blizz to add the token to classic.
---
Cool I'll keep it in mind, most of what I'm gonna do is pvp/make gold/raid anyway
---
After weeks of only seeing the eye for priests you'll see the leaf drop only for it to be given to another hunter likely the gms girlfriend, who will promptly quit the game.
---
I'm hoping for a Sept release so I don't have to compete with all you kids on summer vacay
---
You're not but the first comment was.
---
I don't play retail. I think this is a good idea. Go curl up and have a good cry over it and you'll feel better.
---
It's all about the IF Bridge baby.
---
The API for targeting has changed since Vanilla. Mouseover still works as previously, it's just easier to use in macros now.
---
If the expected retail vacationers theory is true, that 50%+ of the people who join early will quit or go back to retail or split time between the two... I think blizz might be targeting caps on the server much higher than what they want the pop to be later. 
---
So maybe they would let 10k on a server day 1. Or maybe they plan to just server merge later when the 3k cap becomes 1.5k active people a month into release. I don't think they've said exactly what they plan to try. Just saying, a possible approach could have 1-2k people in some starting areas.
---
The field of memeology is a deep and fulfilling one
---
Yeah if it's greyed out it means it's underground or inside a building. So you should find a mine, cave or something like that in the vicinity. 
---
A not well known thing about treasure tracking is that you can spot the real boxes in Stratholme. Some of them drop consumeables and some spawn enemies, a dwarf can easily see which is which. There are also the blank boxes with a plus sign on them and they will always drop holy water.
---
God I remember the ugly. I love my mountain of kogs but there is something about looking like an utter tit but topping damage charts.
---
Had an orc hunter rocking mostly cloth gear in org because it matched his pink strider pet
---
Illidan was overpopulated, but damn was it fun at max level.
---
Mouseover target did not exist in vanilla, but we have modern API now, but i do not think mouseover macros should be in the game.   
---
You can do mouse over for unitframes however.   
---
Mouseover target would make things very powerful, like mouseover coil, blind,interupts, paladin abilitys or anything alike.
---
Which imo makes the game more interesting. Take retail f.ex. There's no miss mechanic, no glancing blows, and classes specs like firemage already start out with an incredibly high crit chance.
---
The specs play more or less exactly the same before stepping into the first raid as they do in the last raid of the expansion. All that really change is the numbers that pop up on your screen. It doesnt make for an interesting character progression imo.
---
Part of what I like with Vanilla is how your class feels better to play as you get gear. Less misses on a warrior f.ex means more steady rage generation, leading to more fluid gameplay. Likewise a firemage will be able to sustain ignites in the endgame, and rogues get more consistent combo point generation with a higher crit chance with the talent in Assassination.
---
Jokes on you. My pitchfork is always out. 
---
‚Äî-E
---
Arctic reach is crucial in pve, pvp and farming.
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage/Abilities](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage/Abilities)  is kiiiind of what I think you're looking for.  Its not the greatest but I think it probably gets the job done.
---
Will they really though? Ideal raid comp brings like 10-11 healers doesn't it? If so there's only room for like 1 priest and 1 rdruid. Now 1 rdruid is pretty normal in high end raiding guilds, but 1 priest is definitely very sub par
---
The reason you don't think they can make a "good fucking game" is because what you classify as a "good fucking game" is incompatible with a modern audience, which is what makes you money.
---
Couple that with the enormous capital and manpower barrier associated with building an MMO and the death of the subscription based business model and you have a recipe for disaster.
---
Developers adapt to their ever-changing market, they didn't suddenly just "forget" what made the MMOs of the 90s and 00s good - they just realized the hard way that younger gamers aren't really interested in the original MMORPG experience no matter neatly you package it.
---
Is it just my phone or is that really low resolution?
---
People want to experience the grind without the grindy aspects.
---
Spec 21/0/30, PVP and raid all at once.  All you gotta do is swap gear.
---
If I'm PvPing on a priest, what do I need on my action bar besides Psychic Scream, PW:S, and Mana Burn?
---
Assuming you're going to be PvPing most of your time (which is what Trispec is designed for), I'd go something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMus0bZbhtZVMGdcuo)
---
A couple of points can be changed, some people prefer spell warding over divine fury, some people go full matyrdom and just 1/2 imp. Fortitude, and most of the stuff in the shadow tree can be adjusted to your liking. Deep Shadow in general is recommended, the biggest reason to go into the tree at all is silence + vampiric embrace in my opinion. Again, it's mainly a PvP spec that happens to be OK at healing easy PvE-content.
---
Pretty much. Seal of Command does 70% weapon damage as holy.
---
Judging for a bit of extra damage isn't so bad mana-wise cause judge is cheap (40-75 mana from 20-60,) but resealing afterwards adds up.
---
Sticking to Rank 1 keeps the seal at 65 mana, instead of jumping to 110/140/180, since most of the damage comes from the seal.
---
This is me
---
Yup. And people are definitely going to spend their sunday evenings helping that special ret paladin out getting ear so he can maybe be viable in a few months,
---
/s
---
Eh, no. You use your ranged attacks, and the frequent tranquility shots at times.
---
Off tanks use Nightfall.
---
It was the Q1 call and mentioned the end date as March 31st, so Q2 is indeed April-May-June with Q3 being July-August-September.
---
When you will be a men, son
---
Then don't play on a high pop server. But it seems ridiculous not to have one for the people that want it.
---
makes totems more useful
---
I'm leveling Pally Prot/Holy dungeon build until I start raiding. Change my mind.
---
Just you, the images are approximately 1800x900.
---
Well we enjoy our mostly free healthcare system and other stuff like that yeah
---
Well that's good to hear.
---
Maybe I confused the later expansions with vanilla.
---
I read your reply with a very philosophical voice in my head.
---
Sweet start to the day :)
---
No one likes waiting 10 minutes to kill a damn boar
---
Crit buff, Battle Res, Innervate, you‚Äôre far from useless to the raid but they don‚Äôt want an oomkin rolling on all that precious Mage gear. That‚Äôs kind of the biggest reason why guilds don‚Äôt like taking a oomkin.
---
Raid weekends/raid days. Try to do professions/dungeons/other world activities, enevitably run into PvP while trying to do other PvE stuff -&gt; "oh hell no we need to defend this from the Alliance, mining can wait" -&gt; mostly PvP but some PvE :P
---
I could hear the exact Murloc audio lol. Love it very funny.
---
Oh really? Bomb! Thanks!
---
Well I think Druid it will be. 
---
For some reason I thought Druid and Shaman was the different horde alliance classes.
---
Brilliant. I'll vcheck it out on desktop later.  Is there a version like this worth costs?
---
Is the answer Kimberly or Obama?
---
Most of the servers introduced around tBC ended up being very low pop. They realized they were overzealous in creating too many servers and merged many of them later. It was probably relatively busy on server opening though, but I doubt it was near the influx of players WoW Classic will see
---
Yes, easily. If you're actually good and comitted that is. If you're bad you'll still find a raid spot but it might be a bit harder. Hunters are absolutely crucial in vanilla WoW raids just because of tranq alone as well as other utility, so guilds will always bring at least 2-3 hunters, usually a few more if it's not a high end minmaxing guild.
---
Twohanders are not PvE weapons so it shouldnt matter who gets it. Hunters need a good twohander just as much as a Warrior for PvP.
---
This one has costs for every spell.
---
If you read his reply like I did in a philosophical voice, it's actually pretty cool :).
---
But yes you are right of course it was more of an expression. I'm from Europe and we use that expression probably way to often "Am I the only one who blah blah..."
---
Ok but. The raid HAS to take at least 2 hunters regardless of how much DPS they do. So if those Hunters can increase their personal DPS by even a small amount they should.
---
This. I‚Äôm going to main Mage and rotate Warrior, Lock and Priest while rested. Should keep me busy for a good year!
---
My guild views it as a waste of a dps slot. Just presenting a point of view that I do not share personally. But some progression guilds out there are crazy unfortunately...
---
Oh fantastic. I couldn't see it on my phone.  You're a star.
---
Well since SM ruin is a pve spec thats pretty good at pvp you aren't quite as bursty as conflag. Its a gradient, the more spell power you have the faster you kill people. You could easily do okay in blues but you're not going to one hit anyone with soulfire. For pvp the itemization is straight forward, rank 10 gear &lt; T1 &lt; T2 but even in the rank 10 gear you can still dish pretty well.
---
Yeah, how dare anyone actually post some useful information about classic wow in a classic wow sub other than low effort memes and shitposts!!!!1
---
When? 13 years ago with 10 fps and no real debuffs on the buss? Right.
---
Or just swing nightfall and actually make a difference for raid
---
They're good speculation and theory crafting, but since armor and resistance values are straight up fabrications we really have no idea who's going to be on top.
---
Maybe you used addons like Healbot or Decursive?
---
Isn't 3.0 wotlk? I might just be confused
---
Yeah but the new people just use this sub as google. I wouldn‚Äôt mind legitimate questions but when you make a post asking for a leveling guide it gets pretty annoying.
---
I believe around 3.5k is the estimated amount of characters that were able to actively play on a server at the same time, rather than the *overall* population of players.
---
The numbers haven't been formally released by Blizz though, so it's all estimation, and it varied between servers.
---
So your argument is that arms is a good spec when you use it in a trash guild that doesnt even attempt to optimize the raid?
---
Afaik there is always a 1% chance to miss or resist. Some talents and gear will increase defence skill which will further push up the amount of hit requkred to minimize missing. Some races and classes will have innate resists as well as resists on gear and from buffs which will also increase the amount of spell hit/spell pen required to minimize spell resists.
---
I also listened to Flyleaf. Though Cassie was probably my favorite (and fucking sad song).
---
That's what resto is for minus the chicken.
---
I am usually an advocate for some of the less Optimal specs shadow/enh/ret/elem but I am sad to say battle chicken bring almost nothing to a raid =(
---
What about all the vids of paladins tanking every raid boss? Honest question, don't know much about raiding. But it seems they're pretty capable.
---
I INTEND to mostly PvE with a dash of PvP in the mix. However, as I originally levelled on a PvP server purely by virtue of not understanding what the different server designations meant and ended up having a BLAST, I think I'll be levelling on a PvP server for WoW-C, and just let the chips fall where they may regardless of what my intent may be.
---
Personally, I prefer calling them Thunderchickens.
---
Oft less.  One crappy mage is more DPS gain than a single 3% spell crit buff =/
---
Private servers have lot of changes. Dynamic or increased respawns of mobs, herbs, veins for example to just fight massive population.
---
So I should try and keep serpent sting up at all times right?
---
It is really not that uncommon to prefer at least some of the old models. Many of them were changed in ways that deviated quite a lot from the original model. One example would be the Night Elf male models - people are still wanting blizzard to redo that one because of the animations and the stretched proportions.
---
Same, but i gave up around level 55, it just plain sucked playing on a server with only like 100 ppl online.
---
Problem with that version was that there were so many items it filled up your bank and void storage so you had to let go of many cool items you had already earned simply because of lack of space. I think the next iteration was best where you didn't need to hold on to the items and all that was needed was to at one point have had that item. The looks still weren't account wide so you had to earn it on the character. Later on they made everything account wide and it made it little silly.
---
If my IRL buddies roll Horde: Troll Hunter or Orc Warrior.
---
Alliance: Human Paladin or Night Elf Hunter.
---
It would, but I don‚Äôt think people want blizzard to start loosening their stance on keeping the game pure. Updated the texture resolution is fine, but adding elements of retail as options is a bit much I think. 
---
I am all someone who likes the new animations and models, particularly the blood elf and Zandalari models. Not a big fan of the human and orc and Tauren though, they look too cartoony and overly animated. Hard to explain but not a fan.
---
God I wish penance was a thing in vanilla
---
Casual guilds usually can't take the DPS hit.  Min maxing guilds might take one for the buff but make them heal.
---
If you want to level very slowly then that seems like a good strategy
---
I would argue this, but I have yet to see anyone post the math to show the net gain in DPS from a hunter sacrificing personal DPS for higher Nightfall uptime. Hunters do low damage, yes, but they are not THAT bad. So it's certainly something that has be mathed out.
---
&gt; And looking like a cowboy in a raid just doesn't fit.
---
Have you looked at what bis geared people look like? I'm not sure fruitsalad is much better and menacing.
---
I'd say due to the improved Fortitude and Divine Spirit buff, a raid would heavily benefit from one Disc Priest, even if their healing is slightly lower. The rest can stay Holy, but I feel its worth experimenting.
---
I had it already, I passed on all kinds of loot while waiting for that to finally drop.
---
3.0 was the prepatch and the release of achievements/homogenized spell power. 3.0.1 was wrath
---
Though we make up for it by having less servers so that the players are more concentrated.  
---
Only downside is constantly getting matched with majority US players for instanced content and getting booted to a US server with like 250 ping.
---
Well they're not gonna need you prot so gratz on being a healer!
---
Gorak how I missed you so.
---
Thanks for another great episode!
---
Every gaming and tv show sub between patches/seasons.
---
I seem to remember WoD being an absolute disaster on launch as well, but that was because of everyone setting up their garrison at the same time.
---
Yeah, i know people in Singapore from my days playing BDO on the SEA servers who will be playing Classic on Oceanic, we might have less servers than US but i don't think we will have any problem filling them up.
---
Stop it, you.
---
Fast spawns cause economy problems and leveling exploits, aka dynamic respawning. Launch of a server with sharding has no affect on economical issues or level exploiting. You will still see a shit ton of people per shard on launch, and plus they are only in leveling zones for the first few weeks of launch. Sharding is hands down the best change that will ever be made or suggested for classic. Stop complaining about something that won‚Äôt affect how you see gameplay and community. And yes I said community because shards will have huge players still and only last a few weeks. Community is still there lmao
---
Being an annoying brat is not useful to anyone.
---
But I get it, it's that time of the day, when the PServer cirklejerk is crawling out from their jobs at McDonalds to pollute the internet again. I guess I will stick to more intelligent subreddits until it's time for the chaff to vacate the internet once again to serve things in cardboard boxes.
---
Maximum I get now is 1.1 mb/s so...
---
Just give Oceanic servers a chance, worst case scenario i'm sure they will include paid character transfers.
---
This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'm not sure many people have given it much thought.   The exchange rate is going to be shit, but you will definitely see people exchanging items/gold/carries on retail for some amount of items/gold/carries in classic.  I bet it will happen in the other direction as well.
---
Speaking from related experience: I cut my MMO teeth in DAoC.  A three realm game.   You could always find someone to trade you gold or crazy rare items on one faction for gold or crazy rare items on another at your own slight loss.   You could also find someone to trade you those things from one server to another or one faction on one server to a different faction on a different server.  There were players that, like the AH barons of WoW, made this their entire game.   To think that retail and classic are not going to have intertwined economies is naive in the extreme.
---
Primarily PvP Priest but some PvE because required for gear. I‚Äôm pretty sure the only true option is Dwarf. Do I just stack up on noggenfoggers and deviate delights or is there a justification for another Alliance race?
---
Spam wingclip to keep nightfall up.
---
If I plan on going PI/SW spec, do I need more plus to spell hit other than from talents to make sure SW debuff has its most uptime? Or just go for the bis healing gear and hope for the best?
---
Because a lot more people are buying gold with tokens than thru 3rd party, because of the risk involved. And also because the token didn't get rid of 3rd party gold sellers at all, it's still going strong they just had to lower their prices
---
I see the thread where the moderator removed it all, and I can believe they were attacking you, but I also see the mod warning you for doing the same thing yourself. But not just that, I can see you attacking people or being rude out of the gate without being provoked to completely different people. It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt even read your own replies. If you seem to have the problem of people being constantly rude to you... maybe it‚Äôs you? Maybe if you weren‚Äôt rude first people wouldn‚Äôt get upset with you? This thread was started by someone saying they don‚Äôt think it should be an option, completely reasonable, and your first reply was, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs extremely self centered,‚Äù and now you‚Äôre claiming to be some victim because someone else upset you. I called you myopic which meant you are missing the bigger picture and you called me a ‚Äúkid‚Äù for it. I‚Äôm not flaming at you, I‚Äôm arguing with you. I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre upset but I am a different person who didn‚Äôt attack you.

And to the still yet open slippery slope argument, Blizzard hasn‚Äôt changed anything they didn‚Äôt have to. The loot system was designed to work around the old GM system, and the texture resolution and improved graphics are what was available at the time with high end computers that most people didn‚Äôt have, like increased resolutions with new monitors. Now you want the new models (which aren‚Äôt improved texture resolutions, they are entirely new models which were developed and implemented 10 years after release) and you honestly can‚Äôt understand why I see a valid slippery slope?
---
Yeah, it definitely was.  I recall it being more general lag/server instability vs overpopulation, but could definitely tie in?
---
Definitely not every raid boss, but some bosses in MC/BWL? Yeah paladins *could* tank those. Original vanilla is extremely different than classic now, the majority of people won't want to sit through 6 hour MC runs so that someone can say they tanked as a paladin; and it definitely won't be a thing when you're talking about AQ40/Naxx.
---
It's doable but they're so far behind feral, which already has a hard time making itself viable compared to warriors. Paladins are brought almost exclusively as healers, with some guilds allowing maybe a couple people to go ret. Warriors will be taken in far greater numbers.
---
Every job in a developed country gives you 4 weeks vacation, time off for parenting if you get a child, sick days and overtime that you can comp out for time off if you wish.
---
Hearthstone and maybe a chat macro
---
Because you were cheating? üòÜ Fact is he's right. Buying gold in vanilla wow is the same as admitting you couldn't hack it, yet you're calling others scrubs... But by all means, swipe your credit card for that 40 mount and instant gratification.
---
Although to be fair 2 alliance bs 1 horde still isn‚Äôt very fair. The horde will win most of these, Blood and Thunder my dudes
---
You will be able to transfer gold between classic and retail regardless. If you look hard enough you will be able to find someone willing to trade you some amount of gold on one for some other amount of gold on the other.  I'm really curious how they plan to combat that.
---
&gt; only that without it people look ridiculous due to collecting many different pieces from many different instances and thus there is little coherence.
---
But that's exactly what classic is with no transmog. People will be wearing pieces of gear from all over the place. Even more so than in vanilla where people were wearing their sets but now people know what the min/max fruitsalad clown wear looks like that's what they'll be going for.
---
I was a guild and raid leader in vanilla for MC and BWL.  I can honestly say that our guild did NOT have a fury warrior as DPS.  There was one exception and he had Thunderfury and therefore was able to keep up in DPS with Rogues &amp; Hunters. 
---
I thoroughly enjoyed being a rogue and if spec‚Äôd and geared properly DPS was off the charts!
---
Depends on the spec. Buncha heals, SW:P, Holy Nova, Silence, Vampiric Emprace, Dispel, Mindflay, Mindblast...
---
that is 2 phases later and a pretty tough grind.
---
That mostly started in BC, and I‚Äôm honestly looking forward to that. Paladin tanking was insane between Consecration and Holy Shield. No CC required; just stack and burn.
---
&gt; The toggle already exists in retail
---
It does not.
---
I love Gorak! Please keep it going!
---
Just a fair heads up: you're going to have to invest some serious time to get to R13. It's basically a full-time job.
---
Worth what, exactly? Worth having fun? It depends. Worth taking to a raid full of min-max'ers who flex their epeen dps numbers after every fight? Not so much. 
---
You won't get invited to raid for a group that is pushing server firsts or speed runs. Since most of the content in classic is manageable with less than 40 players, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to go if you make meaningful contributions to the raid. Boomkin scales better with AQ/Naxx gear, if you know what you're doing. But a lazt Mage will probably out-dps a well-geared Boomkin most of the time. If somebody looks to the damage meters as the only measure, then it will be tough to be considered. For a lot of groups, a single player doing less than theoretical maximum dps won't matter because there are probably doing many sub-optimal things already.
---
The fury warrior looking like a clown in AQ gear never stopped me from envying their gear. The MT in full T2 with thunderfury jaw dropping. Knowing what each piece is without having to inspect them even better.
---
I took a quick look to see if I could help, but yeah, even the "fix reinstalling apps" websites I've seen are quite shady-looking.
---
Well I'll just stick with Windows 7 for as long as possible.
---
It‚Äôs because half the classes are shite - and 85% of the specs are useless.
---
People are told this countless times by ‚ÄúWarcraft veterans‚Äù (youtubers) - so people feel they need to avoid a spec/class because it is one of those.
---
The reality is - 40 man raids are desperate and will take anyone who can play at the time (unless you are a fire mage - you can fuck right off).
---
And only the experienced to upper-tier pvpers will be able to thwart a ‚Äúshit spec/class‚Äù.
---
Positioning, awareness, mechanical skill, communication, skill in general &gt; class limitations.
---
If this was emphasised more - not just thrown onto the side as if it is  fries in your happy meal - then people wouldn‚Äôt pester forums and reddit about it.
---
For 5man content I'd personally take hybrids over pures any day. Having an extra blessing, extra set of totems, the paladin stun/repentence/bop, another aura or even Earthbind totem easily beat out slightly extra damage.
---
The issue is when it comes to raids you already have all the buffs and utility you need, which makes having a much higher DPS more valuable to the raid than slightly more utility from a hybrid.
---
Doesnt mean hybrids cannot raid. It's just that in most cases they just wont be able to contribute enough to make up for their lack of damage.
---
Yeah prepatches are not used. That's like putting the bigger talent trees into classic.
---
Got any examples is pvp support specs? As in focused on healing party members and survivability.
---
Smithing and leatherworking are more about making gold than having personnal best items like tailoring
---
Have you done any feral on a vanilla server? The playstyle is interesting but almost nothing like post-wotlk. You need to use everything if you want to pvp and you also need about 200 keybinds. If not I‚Äôd recommend checking out some on Youtube first because it‚Äôs very weird. I like it but not enough to make it my first character.
---
People absolutely should play what they want. But they need to be given realistic expectations as to what their class and spec can do in endgame.
---
I was wondering if I should use spellpower gear at level 13 and going deep spelladin, but now I now I should go deep retadin instead.
---
silence
---
All the vids? Please share you sources.
---
I'm sure most bosses CAN be tanked by paladins, but that results in crippling the entire raid. Paladins have no taunt. Their single target threat is inferior to Warriors/Druids. They have no proper defensive cooldowns. They are very poorly itemized for tanking (Tier sets are for healing, T2,5 for ret). 
---
The only section where Paladin tanks shine are AoE threat, however the situations where it really is necessary are very few. Also those packs where AoE threat is a big factor can be handled by a Warrior using consumables/AoE threat gear like Engineering shield, grenades, Oil of Immolation etc. Thus sparing you from running with a useless Paladin just to make some trash packs easier.
---
As someone going Alliance this time, I will miss that.
---
Roughly quoting a post of mine from a little while ago:
---
I run a 20/0/31. I prefer this variation for the things I do, people I play with, and situations I find myself in:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sVxuoxZZVfotrcqo
---
It gives up a bit of direct melee power, but allows me to be a bit more flexible with my healing and judging. I just carry a good set of heal gear and a good set of ret gear and swap as needed. If my guild didn't have more than enough pallys to cover all buffs, I would swap Benediction for Imp BoM
---
Gonna have to call BS on the whole "class mastery" thing being harder in vanilla than later iterations of WoW. Trying to play Sub rogue in some of the more modern expansions was absolutely horrific because just to do their opener properly you basically had to have a PHD. Obviously that's a humorous exaggeration, but seriously almost every spec in the game got more complex over time in terms of execution. Comparing the majority of specs these days to frostbolt spam in vanilla, or sinister strike + keep up SnD + evis with extra points, or any other relatively simplistic rotation is just crazy. Personally, I don't think WoW PvE has ever been difficult, but the only thing that was more difficult in vanilla was managing 40 people instead of 25 or 10, and investing a ridiculous amount of time into the game to farm consumes/world buffs etc. The majority of this difficulty comes down on the leadership of your guild, because it's strictly managerial difficulty, not gameplay difficulty.

Paid for carries are extremely popular be in retail - some of the top guilds earn hundreds of millions of gold selling boosting services. To think that won't be also a thing in classic is denial - [WTS naxx boost - accepting retail gold] will be a thing.
---
The only reason to bring a Moonkin is if you can't fill the raid with proper DPSes
---
Think you responded to the wrong person
---
Just checked the loot prio for the guild I'm in and they will be giving it to Fury Warriors over Hunters.

&gt;Afaik there is always a 1% chance to miss or resist.

for spells yeah, for physical attacks though it can be reduced to 0%

On PvP servers you are flagged in all contested zones and enemy zones. PvP is consensual for you in your friendly zones.
---
On PvE, PvP is always consensual.
---
Keep in mind that most private servers serve multiple regions. So while 10K does sound large, in reality it was more like 5k for NA, 5k for EU.
---
Not 100% true. Rogue assassination tree had a talent that gave your poisons a chance to resist dispel, however you're pretty much right since it didn't become more of a core pvp mechanic until TBC.
---
If you wanna hard mmo try soulworker, its a weeb game but its pretty good and challenging
---
Its not main spec for Hunter either. Attack weaving is not viable and there are other 1 handers that are better. My guild has loot prio set at fury warriors &gt; Hunters. Its not a difficult concept.
---
What‚Äôs the point of playing at this point when I can just watch YouTube explanations of every scene
---
According to  [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk9act/are_mouseover_macros_still_going_to_be_a_thing/) mouseover macros don't work at all.  I have a similar macro on my rogue that I use that check mouseover, then focus, then target and uses one of two abilities depending on if I am stealthed or not.  It uses @mousover, @target, stealth, exists, harm, etc. for modifiers.  It would be nice if someone could dig up a classic macro guide to see which of these will work.
---
You can get both of those and still be holy, though.

-Gear up to pre-raid and build a pvp set

Yep, you'll see the same thing in reverse, too.  [WTS &lt;insert current raid&gt; AOTC - 1k gold on classic]

You seem really bothered about the models. Why do you care so much? The models don't affect your game play.
---
No, we just hang around here for the hell of it.
---
Ohhh shit
---
I was dead certain to roll a priest again. But now I am having so much fun playing a druid. on a pserver. I enjoy healing (thus priest), but I don't think I want to heal as a druid. Tanking as a bear is fun. Also, as a priest it sucks being burst down by rogues... I imagine druids are better at wpvp than priests.  That said, I know next to nothing about druids at lvl 60.
---
Of course not.
---
but do they PLAY sports? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?
---
Should be something like this..:  
---
/use [@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Judgement
---
/cast [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][@player] Flash of Light
---
I never said everyone. There were people who voiced their opinions nicely that I didn‚Äôt respond negatively towards at all. And telling someone their statement is self centered isn‚Äôt. You however did start off on the wrong foot for multiple reasons. You can actually see one person I replied to started off decent enough and I replied to him in the same, but once he started being rude I did as well. 
---
Again you accuse me of being rude first. But I wasn‚Äôt. If you think saying someone‚Äôs statement/stance is self centered is rude and grounds for being told to fuck off and shove stuff up their ass, accused of being a pedophile, than I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 
---
Nor am I the only person who likes new models that‚Äôs getting attacked. I didn‚Äôt bring this up as a victim card, I brought it up because I‚Äôm sick of fucking hearing it. And your side is the one instigating it. It always is in this subreddit. Any time there‚Äôs anyone saying ANYTHING positive about the modern game it‚Äôs a shitstorm of downvoted and people attacking that person. Hell you could say you like some of the modern music and people will attack you. I got called a pedo and mass downvoted initially for LIKING the new forsaken models and animations. 
---
And yes I got told to stop because I talked back to the A-hole. I‚Äôm the kind to talk back. 
---
1) Myopic. I know what it means. Coming out the gate accusing me of lacking vision isn‚Äôt a way to make me want to debate nicely with you.
---
2) Accusing me of demanding. I never did, I responded to the OP by saying his statement was self centered which it was, he literally said he wants to make sure other people see exactly what he sees and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt want a model toggle. That is an undeniably self centered reason. Which I give less credence to than slippery slope.
---
3) Being over the third person to use Slippery Slope in this thread. You don‚Äôt even do anything new. In order to make the Slippery Slope a valid argument you have to prove it‚Äôs a sure fired inevitability. But you can‚Äôt. Blizzard has never done anything like this before, there‚Äôs no way to prove that Model Toggle = Game is Now BFA with LFR and everything else.
---
4) I called you a kid because you refused to actually read the other posts and are using Myopic, potentially, to try and sound smarter than just saying ‚ÄúYour missing the bigger picture‚Äù. To me just tossing in myopic makes it sound like your trying tying to sound smarter or are padding for words in an essay, and we are not submitting essays to our professors here.
---
Your experience from vanilla doesn‚Äôt really matter, no one had a clue then. They do now, and those specs suck.
---
Yeah, but guilds could go a year without seeing a BRE. On the rare occurrence that a weapon like this drops, it should go to a Warrior.
---
Haha I love the savagery.
---
That's another misconception.  Most of my guild at the time was in their 20's-30's all the specs and gearing BIS was figured out back then. Just because you were 12 and didn't know what you were doing didn't mean the rest of us didn't.
---
Warlock master race
---
Melodramatic posts like this make me want classic to fail sometimes. It‚Äôs just a game ffs
---
Seriously, you can play whatever you want. A lot of people are basing their ‚Äúdata‚Äù off of Pservers which isn‚Äôt that accurate. You can play any class you want, any spec. In 40 man raid environments there is plenty of wiggle room. Play well and you will get the content done you want to. Find a guild of people you mesh with and it will be so much fun, trust me.
---
I liked the new models more. The graphics of Vanilla aged poorly IMO and I like D2 models/art more. 
---
Why do you care? The models don‚Äôt affect your gameplay.
---
Don't worry, you can make up to 50 chars
---
I read the post, and you are wrong.
---
No I'm just sitting here browsing new on the classic subreddit you bald monkey
---
Helmet from Magmus is another
---
Classic will run on modern API, so you will be able to make macros just like you are used to on retail. No need for old macro guides.
---
omg..thottbot!
---
It was so easy to top dmg meter as a rogue I went assassination so I could try to beat a better geared rogue who raided assassination spec. He heavily out geared me but I think I did pretty good to keep up with him, but if I went combat I destroyed him.
---
I usually prefer following the stream of actions followed by people, his personal choice aims towards something else. I have no reason to believe anything else because of this
---
Wont have time for subreddit first days outside of biobrakes.
---
Lol k on what part?  All of it?  so what, everyone has to run the min maxer runs every single time?
---
Sub optimal specs are fine.  They just have to work extra hard to be included and usually only get one spot per raid.
---
I will take a motivated prepared Ret over a shitty warrior any day, because that ret isn't going to stand in the fire then demand a battle res.

What dows that even mean???

I like all the old animations more and I dont see a point in hi rez character models when we still have all the old gear. Some of the new spells look good. I like what they did with resto shaman and made all the spells look like water.

Actually, the best google hits for this type of questions come from here
---
This has already been discussed [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/biat5r/mouseover_macro_in_classic_wow/)

Mouseover did exist in vanilla and i'm pretty sure they will stay in Classic.
---
All the information is out there instead of asking reddit do a google search. And instead of answering stupid reddit threads with false information, just ignore them.
---
Making room for that sick beta announcement
---
If you are min/maxing none of these are viable specs. Bringing them along is wasting your guilds time. It comes down to if you are casual or trying to clear a raid as quickly and efficiently as possible. Some can be bearable if you are only taking one along,  but this is why it‚Äôs important to know what you‚Äôre signing up for. Don‚Äôt apply to a hardcore min/maxing guild and expect to be allowed to run a sub optimal build, you‚Äôll be asked to go re-spec or be kicked from the raid. If you are in a semi-hardcore guild and they just don‚Äôt care that‚Äôs cool. It comes down to the leader and understanding his decision making will effect how long 39 other people spend in a raid. Most of these guys have lives and don‚Äôt want to be in MC or BWL for 3 hours. So min/maxing is where I always land. 
---
It‚Äôs important to realize that it‚Äôs not about if you ‚Äúcan‚Äù do it and still clear the content, it‚Äôs about clearing the raid as efficiently as possible.
---
Sure, sub optimal specs are fine, vanilla content is easy, at least up to naxx, but really the post could be summed up as ‚Äúall these specs suck, but vanilla is easy so feel free to have limited spots for them‚Äù.
---
When you go to say that if they max out consumables, some can perform mediocre, well why wouldn‚Äôt you just take a mage who uses consumables instead?
---
Yeah it's a combination of a few things. Stuff getting nerfed, player abilities getting buffed, items getting buffed, and of course much greater knowledge of the encounters.
---
Vanilla progressively became easier over time, and we'll be getting the easiest version of it.
---
"Neither is harder or easier. Just different."
---
....no
---
Dwarf priest is superior not only for fear ward but stoneform to remove certain poisons is going to be a lifesaver. Being able to remove a viper sting or a blind as a priest is really big.

This post is correct.

But &gt;Only correct for physical dps. Spells need 16% hit

not sure what you mean with "mbps", but if you mean *bits*, then it's 8 times less than *bytes*.
---
why would I? Right?
---
G-short sounds like a rapper name
---
It's not slight damage, a properly specced/played rogue or mage would do more than double the damage of a hybrid trying to dps in a 5 man.
---
But what is the alternative? Not even pservers could have normal spawn rates because the cluster of people in one place was just WAY too big, hence the reason dynamic respawns begun and stayed on servers ever since. What people don't realize is that you will have a much harder time in classic with sharding then on a pserver with dynamic respawns.
---
On-top of that, sharding will not bypass the first zones. So it will be actual hell on earth when you leave the starting zones compared to pserver where dynamic respawn rates isn't removed after the first zone.
---
For some people, that 'sky is falling' mentality permeates every aspect of their life. Stressing over 'what ifs' is just part of their identity. They don't know how to enjoy life, so they try to make everyone else as miserable as them.
---
I feel like back then people had a less idea of what was optimal, but everything still worked out okay. Seems like there's a big group of people excited to play hybrids now, and another group of people who are excited to use min/maxing. Which I guess, is balanced. If I was a guild leader though I'd look at the person's skill and competency keeping in mind that what the hybrids lack in dps they make up for in other ways, and I'd be open to a few even in very serious groups.
---
Nah I guess everyone around here is really casual about it
---
You have to sac some otherwise useful points in Holy to grab Divine Spirit, so you might as well go all-in and grab Power Infusion and the other deep-Disc talents that are actually really strong anyway.

&gt; Mouseover target did not exist in vanilla
---
It did exist, but only if you knew how to script. An example of mouseover macro would be:  
---
``/run if UnitExists("mouseover") and UnitCanAttack("player","mouseover") then TargetUnit("mouseover") CastSpellByName("Fear") TargetLastTarget() else CastSpellByName("Fear") end``  
---
mouseover was a valid unitId even back in vanilla.

What? Guessing you didn't watch the video. It's a funny fan video, calling it a guide as part of the joke. Pull the stick out and stop being a douche.
---
To 90% of the players (maybe more) this isn't going to matter.  People are going to take a while to level to 60 and then gear up properly for raids. 
---
Plus, people forget that raiding was such a small part of the Classic experience. WoW has been so washed out that the only real goal people see are Raiding &amp; High Rank in PvP.
---
Simple answer.  The motivated player even if using a suboptimal spec will be more reliable and more consistent that a mediocre anything else.
---
As a raid leader I will take the motivated person ever single time.
---
Throw in RP on my ‚ÄúMostly PvP, sometimes PvE‚Äù response
---
A motivated player wouldn‚Äôt play a spec that suck.
---
Wait, how is only PvP even an option? You level, get gear, and farm mats/consumables in PvE - even if you wanted to ‚Äúonly PvP‚Äù, there‚Äôs no way to accomplish this.
---
Then they wouldn‚Äôt be, by definition, min-maxing.
---
 below and let me know!
---
and 1v1 against classes that can't dispel it, its a free win.
---
If you are failing on BWL it has nothing to do with bringing a hybrid.  You beat BWL on mechanics alone. Only Razorgore is a DPS check point the rest is learning the dance.
---
1.12 made the game so easy, that most guilds stop raided, and just pvped to get full R14 gear from vendors instead.  
---
Before 1.12 the game was much harder yes, 1.12 hit when we where clearing naxx,  we had 5hrs+ naxx runs, several days a week, when 1.12 hit we cleared it all in 3hrs. So that says alot of how much it changed the game.
---
alot of people don‚Äôt know there is difference between Mbps and MBps
---
If they would add transmog, i would not be interested in transmog anymore:/ thats the whole point, identifying the gear
---
Lowest on the healing meters.
---
Exactly.  That's why I said they probably already googled it.  It brings them here to an ancient thread that they don't want to necro, so they start a new one to discuss it because they weren't satisfied by reading whatever comments were there.
---
Thanks for all the input everyone! Glad to hear I'm not the only one planning on playing! See you all in Azeroth this summer!
---
I hear BRE drops like every week.
---
But play what you like man. Night elf isn‚Äôt bad for pvp with drink-&gt;shadowmeld.
---
Blackrock was the best thing. Remember blowjobs for Glaives? I remember.
---
&gt; Fast spawns cause economy problems and leveling exploits, aka dynamic respawning. Launch of a server with sharding has no affect on economical issues or level exploiting. 
---
Huh? This is just false. Sharding multiplies the amount of available mobs/nodes, and therefore multiplies the amount of resources entering the game. You could make the argument that sharding will (we hope) only be enabled in the initial zones for each player race so the amount of economical impact will be lessened, but it's wrong to say it doesn't cause an economical impact at all.

Ahhhhhhhh!

---
I will be leveling warrior. Trying to get into a raiding 2-3/7 guild as MT/OT but looking forward to do pvp as I get better gear. 
---
My philosophy is doing everything without much focus and obsession on any aspect. Though raids until Naxx will probably trigger that obsession.
---
Yeah they look like a mess, as they should. If everyone is dressed up like dolls then it really devalues the art of the game.
---
&gt;  Do you guys live in very remote rural places, places with a lot of corruption, or just in poverty stricken areas? 
---
I don't (well, there is a lot of corruption, but my internet is fine), but my parents lives in a small town in rural Sweden (not super rural), which is a country with supposedly great internet. Up until they installed fiber two years back it was impossible for them to get over 12mbit with DSL. I think they even payed for 24mbit, but it wouldn't go higher because they were too far away from the box in the centre of town or something like that. They did get DSL back in like 2001 though, so that's something, but it never got very fast.

to be fair though, Ive had months, many months, and I still haven't decided on what to play. I'll always love rogue the most, but I'm scared it will be super overplayed.

Playing philosphy - as you would do PvE but only as a mean to get the rewards to play for PvP. Of course you can't PvP your way to the endgame.
---
You only sac lightwell (and maybe spirit of redemption) to get divine spirit.  You keep the important spiritual guidance (25% spirit to spell power) and if you forgo spirit tap you also keep spiritual healing (10% more healing).
---
The tradeoff to get power infusion is pretty massive because the 10 points before power infusion gets you very little in terms of healing from the disc tree.

I didnt really have any issues at TBC launch other than an enormous amount of lag and server instability (which that being said, the lag and instability wasnt even as bad as the AQ patch from what I remember, it was actually pretty reasonable considering). I didnt have much issue with waiting for spawns and such, the only thing I remember having trouble with was much later with things like Ring of Blood.
---
Pummeler farming isnt that bad. It's not like you need a pummeler active 100% of the time. And what do you mean doesn't play like ret? You're auto attacking, judging as needed, and dropping max rank consecrations when you crit. It plays the exact same mechanically. Neither SoC or SoR take gameplay to use.

to be fair, a prepared ret can do way more than 300. the issue is that rets have to go above and beyond whats expected to even compete, where as a combat rogue can LITERALLY just press sin strike and SnD and do equal if not better damage, with no buffs
---
Ah, ok, so basically how you would play if you could have it your way? 
---
My answer doesn‚Äôt change then - mostly PvP but some PvE üòã
---
I think this could mean a few things - idk gaming protocol when it comes to business, but I will make a few assumptions:
---
1) they could beginning the next phase which will be going to beta or stress testing
---
2) if it is stress testing next then we might see the game out shortly after
---
3) if it is beta then we will test that for a month and then stress test.
---
as prefaced I have no clue, but it's my hope.

But you need to have a phone for that!

I never said failing. I feel like you didn‚Äôt even read what I wrote. It‚Äôs not about if you ‚Äúcan‚Äù do it. It‚Äôs about efficiency. Obviously you can clear any content with a few random specs, especially old content. But yes it is indeed learning the dance. However, that dance can still be done most efficiently. I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre going for the fastest runs you aren‚Äôt going to bring sub-optimal specs. One or two won‚Äôt greatly change the clear time, but it will change it. Then you get people who are like ‚Äúwell if they can do it why do I have to run raid spec!‚Äù As a leader I feel it‚Äôs easier to demand raid spec and you can play whatever in your off time.

Nice, but requires the use of both feet and you really can't rest your foot on it and keep it inactive. The thing I described would allow you to rest the full weight of your foot and leg on it and have it do nothing, yet with a simply motion of your foot allow for 3 axis of control. And since you're only using one foot, there's nothing preventing you from using a simply pedal with your other foot to control a push to talk action like u/PlanksPlanks mentioned.

Whats after Naxx??????

Tbh. he is (somewhat) right though. Your experience from vanilla is great input, but u have to have someone playing p-servers to let him share his experience, make a comparison and then decide. Because i actually played on p-servers and while u are right on a few sort of things, u are wrong on other things.
---
With this i mean Feral DPS especially. Feral DPS needs way more consumables than a rogue, that's completely true, and farming a mace from gnomeregan to min-max DPS and actually Providence good DPS is not that fun also, but.. mid DPS range? that is a joke right? u will see ferals, actually taking their spec serious(most important thing about getting taken serious with a "hybrid" spec) be top 5-10 DPS. You can watch Feral DPS videos on YouTube, there are enough of them and all players that played Feral themselves will share the same experience, Feral is a very good DPS. that being said, u will not only see 1 Feral DPS in the raid, and also Feral tanks are very good, also in Naxx they are

Once you have Naxx on farm you start inventing challenges.  One of the resto druids in our guild wellfared himself an insane caster dps set and did everything in his power to try and make balance work. It didn't work but it was fun bringing him along to watch him try new things.

What‚Äôs a good class for classic wow?
---
Launch of server with increased spawn rates doesnt have any effect on the economy either, they only left it like that for like the first week.
---
I actually PLAYED new servers, it was a big difference from just rolling a random server and seeing 2-3 people. It was like an enormous moshpit of people climbing ontop of eachother, 1000 people straight out of the gate like a mass marathon, very fun and unique experience that was very much part of vanilla if you liked rolling new servers.
---
Does beta mean out characters get deleted once it‚Äôs released?
---
The spell and talent changes help but it's not the big problem. This is shown by the fact that top guilds clear MC while still in green leveling gear. The problem is the years of theorycrafting and practice on countless private servers they've had.
---
yeah the beta would be on their beta servers im guessing.

My only rebutal to this is we know that values on bosses in Pservers are wrong. The nostralious guys admitted it was all fudged and they did the best they did but they had no idea how any of the calculation worked on Blizzards back end.
---
So the anecdotal information and images/old fraps videos of Vanilla raids are really all we have to go on for classic.  Pserver information is going to end up disappointing a lot of people who think they have this "all figured out" tm.

That's good to hear. So can you also focus-heal someone w/o changing target?

"Nobody else trying to go into this cave?" This was a scenario I never experienced, there were literally people running by all the time, I remember going into caves like that, people fighting left and right, maybe I pull a mob running to the bottom of the cave, but someone pulls it off me as I run by, you get down to a unique quest mob, theres a few people killing the mob and a few people waiting, random people start inviting, you wait about 5s for it to respawn and kill it with your group and leave.

The server cap is always the same. I had to queue to get in, pretty much every new server was like this. People wanted to check out new servers when they launched. Almost every one of the new servers ended up being Low pop in the end, people would join to check it out, level for a time and then quit or go back to their old server. This was commonplace amongst new servers, they had enormous population booms that quickly fell off a few months in.
---
Again, leveling on new servers was FASTER for the earlier levels than it is on pservers, which is where everyone seems to be getting their information from.
---
It depends if youre using the sharding argument as an artificial way to increase the server pop, which then, it would alleviate queues, but upping the spawn rates the old fashioned way was still a very effective solution and was the vanilla way.
---
They've unstickied threads in the past, such as [one of the AV updates](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908/). It's just bad form to have like 10 stickies in a single subforum, and the employee alpha thread was probably considered very low prio.

However, do they need to stress test the servers? These are servers that are currently running BFA, but instead running Classic.

Also, I don‚Äôt see a beta test lasting very long. They already know the major exploits and the issues they had with last release.

We can resolve this by erasing people‚Äôs brains before they enter MC.

I dont think you read the whole thread. My point is that the spells and talents are making it possible for people in green gear to clear MC.
---
If you get 10% crit from talent that equals 200 spellpower according to bis-lists for mages that ive read. And its pretty hard to get geared to 200 spellpower. 
---
https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/22307-mage-guide-plus-pre-raid-gear-list/
---
&gt;Crit. Frost mages don't benefit as much from crit as fire mages so a good guideline is 20sp is worth roughly 1% crit. Even if it's not massively important don't ignore it especially in end-game. When raiding AQ40 all mages will spec fire and crit becomes important to keep ignite up.

If your Heal and Greater Heal takes 0.5 seconds less to cast, its easier to constaly top-heal the tank and thus reducing the gear needed for the tank.

I feel like you are misunderstanding me too.  You bring ONE offspec perraid maybe two in nax for Spriest weaving if you have enough locks.

So yeah if you have a raid and 2 rets wants to go and 1 feral and one spriest and answer is NO.  They can roate raids or nights.  I agree no one wants to sepdn years in a raid.  But one off spec won't hurt.

NOW Pugging no don't waste your or anyone else time show up with a optimal spec because pugs suck ass even when all the right classes are specced appropriately..

I played on Auchindoun at BC launch as well and it was the same. You would notice literally dozens of people anywhere you went  if you played the first day. Goldshire and such were hotbeds of activity with people streaming in and out. Honestly, Auchindoun was the least populated for leveling of new servers I rolled, I think most people wanted to stay on their old servers and just get to Outland as fast as possible.

Sounds a bit like you should try playing a Paladin there man. Although druids are for sure super fun.

---
Idk their intent for server pop. I know the servers have come a long way since vanilla but I would assume sharding tech made them relax a bit on that type of stress that would be put on the servers. Then again hardware has come a long way too so maybe not.
---
The beta doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be long either. I‚Äôd throw ‚Äúmonth‚Äù out there with a 2 week down time - to bring a classic ‚Äúsummer‚Äù by summer solstice.  June 20-ish

Then again they could just do neither and dump the game on us in a month!

It doesn‚Äôt matter what the bis is. It only matters who benefits the raid the most by equipping it.

Generally a family and friends section of the alpha, then closed alph with player invites (this gets skipped often), then closed beta, then open beta + stress tests, then release. Thanks for trying to be a condecending asshat, though.
---
If you convince everyone else on your faction to take it easy, it won't be hard at all.
---
There are some changes under the hood like spell batching that they would likely want stress tested. It wouldn't be about stressing the server hardware to see how well it handles the load but more to see if any issues pop up from having a lot more clients connected at once. You know how big game launches are constantly suffering from network issues? That kind of stuff is never predictable. If it were, most devs would have it fixed before release.

&gt;and it still has the empty gaps\textures between zones or at zone edges.
---
That's because those areas were empty/not properly textured until cataclysm. The previously inaccessible areas were remodelled to allow flying and new zones. 
---
Your map is the cataclysm map, but it looks like they have pasted in old maps of each old zone onto the Cataclysm map base.
---
Or it could just mean they didn't think the thread needed a sticky anymore...
---
Just because the servers can handle a stress load (for the most part) with retail data, doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the same for Classic.
---
holy fuckin hell you guys get worked up over nothin
---
The amount of effort that wasn't put into this meme is almost commendable. Just almost.
---
The thing is that multiple classic Servers have about the same value numbers. And This is not by copying other Servers.
---
Also, they are not going to have a huge difference in it. Yeah ofc there will be differences, but Feral won't be going from top 5-10 DPS to top 15-20 DPS. This is just not the reality.
---
Also u have to considered that all the people having played classic might not even know what powershifting is.
---
Also u are talking about taking the gear from rogues away. I'm sorry, what gear? U mean the T1 and T2 Sets? Didn't know a rogue can wear that. For ZG and AQ40 i see a point, but seriously, if it comes down to trinkets, rings and neck, not only ferals would be the ones that are going for that gear. And you are a Guild u have to consider and either u have a fair system or ur are just in the wrong guild.

Warcraft 3? Does it auto update through Battle.net? Because it isn't in my list to the left.

I guess I need to reserve judgement (heh) and investigate it closer then.  The videos I saw of it looked like it played more like prot with a 2h.  Reliance on lots of small procs and consecrate rather than juicy crits.   TBH, though, I play ret for pvp...spelladin may or may not be outright competitive for sustained dps on boss fights, but it does not (from what I know) look at all bursty for pvp.
---
I know plenty here won't agree, but I wouldn't have any problem with tweaking hp/armor/resistance/damage of bosses to make them a little more of a challenge.
---
Sure, I mean unless they decide to remove focus from classic, but I don't see why they would do that since it was already technically possible to have focus macros in vanilla by using addons or scripts.

Appreciate ya posting my video, glad ya'll enjoyed!
---
Short answer: when your spells miss in, they'll show up as "resisted" on the target. This is related to hit rating, not resistance. 
---
Resistance reduces the damage of spells of the corresponding school. When it happens, you'll usually see a much lower number than what you normally hit for. This is also known as a "partial resist".
---
Huh, TIL.

"World of warcraft classic will use the same class names as it did in vanilla"
---
One isn‚Äôt too bad. But now we‚Äôre getting into different raids as well. Spriest really isn‚Äôt that bad in naxx. Some major guilds actually ran one. But as far as early vanilla MC/BWL it‚Äôs borderline useless. It‚Äôs kind of just a waste of a slot. I get what you‚Äôre saying though. I think it‚Äôs having a min/max mentality that gets a lot of people so much farther with progression and clear times though and eventually is a big difference maker.
---
Username checks out.
---
I have been playing on the pservers and I can tell you for a fact that the melee damage calculations are borked.  Proper fucked up.  Mage scaling is off the charts too.  Live was a bit more conservative with scaling and I am not sure how it worked on the back end but people are setting them selves up for disappointment thinking the pserver numbers are even close.
---
If you want to play an off spec you have to play at 100% so yeah if they want to raid as feral yes I expect they have done their research and practiced on dummies to get their rotation down.
---
A lot of BIS items were non set and yeah I am talking AQ 40+ feral itemization is almost non existent prior to Zg if I remember correctly.  I remember a fair bit of drama on the forum over ferals trying to get non set peices and rogues having a fit about it.  Understandably so.  
---
You reminded me of something I missed though that offspec will never get gear over a pure or optimal spec.
---
Many babies will burn this summer.
---
That is the most retarded thing I've ever heard.
---
1.12 didn't buff anything.
---
Threat generation/reduction abilities got WORSE from the normalization change. Most haste abilities got worse from the haste normalization change.
---
And pretty much every class got nerfed or it's changes were primarily pvp oriented that basically have no impact in raiding.
---
The only buffs in the entire patch notes for 1.12 or 1.12.1 are Life Tap and Garrote.
---
And even if you account for the rogue review, it's pretty common knowledge that the rogue review sucked and made them weaker than they were before in most regards.
---
You did faster because either A. you got better RNG, B. You were better geared than last week, and/or C. Your guild just didn't screw up as much this time.
---
Guilds stopped raiding because TBC was announced for the beginning of 2007 and it became pointless to waste all that time and effort on gear that is about to be worthless in about 6-7 months.
---
And what content they did do was just to kill time.
---
The only raids that suffered any kind of major losses due to patches were MC and BWL.
---
ZG was never meant to be hard, unless you were completely fresh 60's raiding for the first time. Same with AQ20. They were catch-up raids. to get your raid through MC/BWL faster, so you could start on AQ.
---
AQ even after 1.10 and 1.11 was still about the same as it was in it's release patch, and bugs and tweaks aside. You had stronger priests yeah, and they fixed shield slam, but that was about it.
---
Naxx though was pretty much always the same from 1.11 until 2.0.1 when all the TBC mechanics were added.
---
On the other hand, I'm going to be busy playing the game, so I won't care.

A buffed and geared hunter doing solely melee attacks is a huge loss of DPS. There's a reason everyone is giving Nightfall to their off tanks instead of hunters.

Agreed SPriest itemization doesn't even exist until ZG really. And prior to having their baseline spell damage they are rough.

Not really true at all. Melee spend more on consumes than casters. Elementium Sharp stones or shadow oils are very expensive and you need 2 every half hour so 8 for a 2 hour raid. Three or more types of juju, mongoose, dumplings, etc really adds up.

Sorry it was meant to be light touch not a tactica, I can add it though.

A "soft" hit cap of 5-6% is needed in order for your yellow hit (abilities/spells) to hit targets that are level 60. However I think it's worth to mention that if you plan on dualwielding in pvp it could be wise to consider going even higher, like +8%, in order for your off-hand auto attacks to hit more frequently. But this is really just a matter of what you prefer.

Darn it, Parkinson's strikes again!
---
&gt; The goal is to prevent dead servers after the looky-loos leave
---
That's server stability.
---
Sharding's not there to keep the physical servers from catching on fire. It's about the stability of the server as a community.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre throwin a lot of big words at me, because I don‚Äôt understand them imma take em as disrespect.
---
600 is a realistic number for the amount of humans in Northshire on launch if we consider a nominal 3k pop, 50% faction split, 40% human. Still way too many people.
---
Our top dps in vanilla was usually our fury warrior, but it took him a bit to get geared to where he was always #1 or #2

Hey, I work as a network/system admin for some industries. I'm Canadian. I work in northen Canada, so we go there by plane and when we go there we stay for a couple of weeks. So I accumulated enough hour to have 8 weeks so far. But worked a lot, too much, recently. Good thing is I will be able to play at work. :)
---
Anything, as long as it's warrior
---
No one here will. People just like to refresh the page.
---
Meh, play warrior
---
So much is under the surface and i think thats what makes WoW so great, among many other things. Nobody in game forces you to learn about places like Alterac, but if you decide to its really interesting.
---
Nothing feels fake about Azeroth, atleast as far as games go.
---
&gt; most guilds stop raiding, and just pvped to get full R14 gear from vendors instead.
---
Easily the most bizarre bullshit claim I've ever read LOL.
---
Exactly this.
---
thats actually not true. one shadow priest is ran to buff warlocks even in hardcore guilds. youtube some raid recordings, like a bunch of guild run a shadowpriest.
---
restor druids fucking sucks in comparison to other healers, so you rather may want to bring druid in form of moonkin for the buff and br, and bring like another priest shaman/paladin instead for a stronger healers setup, while still having druids buffs and utility but in moonkin. i've seen 1 moonkin ran in a various highend guilds. again you can youtube a bunch of recording of it.
---
and feral tanks are actually more optimal for certained bosses, and its good to have in a roster even if for a potential sub.
---
Damn so Blizzard isn‚Äôt even obligated to give us a release date anytime soon because he‚Äôs in no immediate danger.
---
You haven't proved a single point all day
---
Depends on his starting weight.
---
This is the WoW community we're talking about.
---
Careful the people on this subreddit are quite rabid to thinking that doesn't toe the party line
---
Mind control
---
As someone who was the MT for a US first guild on a few kills, vanilla through WoTLK... my most favorite raid was always Kara... it was just.... fun.  Way more fun than any other raid IMO.
---
I stuck on a Nightwish album when I was doing Scarlet Monastery on a private server for the nostalgia hit.
---
I‚Äôm gonna do the opposite and I‚Äôm gonna eat only cheesecake until we get an announcement. You‚Äôre move Brizzard
---
Thank you for the reply! In my case the pros outweigh the cons here, so it‚Äôs a go for me. Not trying to rush to 60 on my first toon, so XP isn‚Äôt too big of a deal. Also I‚Äôm a filthy dwarf holy paladin, so no lvl 40 mount fees for me haha. Oof not looking forward to that grind for the pristine black diamond. Still not as bad as other classes though (minus warlock).
---
I could definitely see why group leveling in classic would turn a lot of people off because of the cons though, so it‚Äôs not for everyone. For example, my dad, mom, and brother always end up solo leveling in mmos because when they make characters, they have to get to max lvl before making an alt. This makes syncing up play time pretty difficult. I make three chars as soon as I pick up a game now because I want to secure their names and get the creation process done for a while. It also lets me be able to focus professions/RP on one, group leveling on another, and solo leveling for the last. Sadly, I never got to try group questing in vanilla.
---
Note: Yes my family plays WoW. My Dad was lucky enough to meet my mom in an arcade back in the 80s. They got the award for coolest parents growing up. Over 30 years happily married and coming up on 15 years of playing WoW!
---
This was absolutely golden. Subbed and already watched all your videos
---
What is this a reference to? It's bugging the crap out of me.
---
Hey, Boomkin are useful. Mages like the crit Aura and the healers appreciate Innervate.
---
You mean besides the fact you didn‚Äôt read anything till I called you out on it?
---
You mean besides the fact you aren‚Äôt here for an honest conversation? Because snide comments like that just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to actually discuss the actual thing im just going to insult you because I have no response‚Äù.
---
Now the title of kid REALLY fits you.
---
That link is definitely a virus.
---
did you forget the rewamped the talent tree ?5
---
No, that makes too much sense.
---
why
---
Be druid
---
Rank 1-10 can be done casually if you play every day. The problem with the honnor system is you don‚Äôt get locked in place. If you don‚Äôt play for a week you basically downrank 2 weeks worth of rank% 
---
Rank11-14 is where you need to turbo nerd and be in bracket stacking premade 8-12 hour honnor farming groups 7 days a week.
---
Muggers Belt- DM North.
---
Circlet of Restless Dreams- Emeriss
---
Deaths Sting - Cthun
---
Aged Core Leather Gloves- MC
---
Edgemasters
---
Distracting Dagger- DM West.
---
well thats exactly the point, you seem to be missing. its not a bigger upgrade for the shaman upgrading from aurastone, than a priest upgrading from bene.
---
I've finally decided to roll priest over warlock. I have plenty of experience healing in Wrath (basically, I am extremely comfortable healing) and afterwards, but I don't have much experience with tactics like downranking spells that were popular in vanilla. I tend to prefer to play support over pure dps or healing, so I was looking at a disc/shadow spec for healing, PI, and shadow weaving. 
---
My question is:
---
Is healing as disc going to be significantly lower than healing as holy, or will I at least be able to keep up while also providing dps support? Also, how versatile is this type of spec (I will probably be running more 5 mans and pvp than raids, but I would like to raid whenever I get the chance)?
---
I feel like the servers will be 50% warriors, 40% rogues, and 10% everyone else lol
---
That's clearly not the context that the guy used it in, come on.
---
&gt; Tokens killed gold farmers.
---
Straight up not true. They just switched focus. The 3rd party "services" spam in modern wow is _much_ worse than it ever was in classic.
---
Yeah it was patch 2.0.1 and not 1.12 they revamped honor system and raiding died.
---
You have a ton of procs and tiny white hits, and you don't really slam into people with huge 1.5k crits like Waradin does, at least not early, in BwL when you have Judgement, you can probably do that with your secondary non-pummeler weapon. You carry two, a big sword and pummelers, you dont always use pummeler, just when you have the active.
---
Yeah this is not a PvP build, Waradin is where its at for pvp. You can honestly play both with the same spec. Spelladin is a pretty standard 20/0/31 spec, it's totally functional with a more STR focused PvP set. The only difference between the usual 20/0/31 specs and this one is that you take Imp SoR. While the PvE build doesn't really want SoC or Repentance, you have free points to get both if you want to go for more PvP power.
---
before 2006 sonic was a respectable name.
---
I am getting more and more worried about the difficulty in Classic. Many players left Retail wow because it was getting too easy and every change Blizzard is making to Classic is also making Classic easier. 
---
patch 12 Talents and balance, 16 debuffs and patch 12 raid optimized stats on gear. 
---
These are the advantages i will have over myself from back in Vanilla. I dont like it. 
---
Classic will still have all the community aspects and all that great stuff but man the difficulty of MC, BWL and all the lvl 60 dungeons might just make the entire 1. year of Classic disappointing. 
---
Blizzard might fix it though. Buff monster HP by 30% and give them 15% more dmg sort of thing.
---
Have you tried to or seen people do mass world PvP in Bfa? The server crashes when 20-30 people are involved...
---
Awesome, I for one am going to level slowly and will want good gear throughout the whole process.
---
To be fair, he could have just been bad. Plus he brought utility.
---
Dual talent would be a nice add to vanilla. Or at least a lower gold cap on talent swapping.
---
I will never run a nelf male unless druid
---
PRAISE BE JULY THE SIXTEEN
---
Heroes of the Storm progress was kept
---
I think most likely what they will do is drop another nugget of information today and the removal of the sticky is to free up space for that.  I doubt it will be a beta invite.
---
I think you are mixing up 1.12 with 2.0.1 because the honor system changed in 2.0.1 and thats when raiding died on the realm i was playing on.
---
Its actually more a cleave weapon on trash since most bosses will have zero armor if you are using the correct debuffs.
---
You might get gastritis or an ulcer. I would not recommend not eating anything at all for an extended period of time just for a video game.

"At first, all was well as happiness and joy spread like infection during the first months. Gradually though,  that sweet candy turned to ash in their mouths. An addiction unlike any other, that time had only strengthened. The mothers' milk turned sour from the red bull and hot pockets. The men vanished, found only in the darkest dwellings that were lit by a single LED screen. The young suffered, and some perished, but the luckiest were gifted with a subscription. The cycle continues today, but nothing like Summer 2019."

-Some old wise-person from the year 2100
---
Now let me in!
---
Right on dude.
---
I'll support you: no sex til Classic for me.
---
(PS: It won't happen anyway -- I'm in a 6 year relationship.)
---
I need a date soon. I've already lost a window to a work trip scheduled. God help me if its released the last 2 weeks of July.
---
GIVE ME A DATE I NEED TO RESERVE MY TIME
---
Because 12/20/2014 was the last day of fall 2014.
---
Mages, rogues and warriors always sit at about 15% each for priv servers. Wouldn't worry too much about that, what are you afraids gonna happen? Dont worry about getting raid spots, just be at the forefront
---
Spriest in aq+ yes, before they were absolute dogshit.
---
It depends on the activity of the other players on your server, but when I was doing it, it took about 6 hours of dedicated farming in a premade just to fight the weekly decay at rank 8, and it goes up significantly from there.
---
If we have learned anything from blizzard they will not be devoting more customer service time to dealing with these types of issues.
---
&gt; Imo that would be a nice compromise, but whatever.
---
There's actually a great compromise already for people who enjoy transmog. It's still currently available for all to use in the version of the game where it's appropriate - current wow. It's NOT appropriate for classic wow and anyone advocating for changes like this should fuck right off.
---
[AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!](https://media.tenor.com/images/486be6e525b5bd3ec9fa69d8907e8a8e/tenor.gif)
---
Welp, I know who won't be joining us for classic.
---
Source?
---
Idk but you might die b4 blizzard announces a release date...
---
We all know you're doing this just so you can consume copious amounts of mountain dew and doritos when it releases. I applaud you OP.
---
Depends on how big he is. If you're fat enough you can survive months on only water and vitamins/minerals.
---
Right because the game used to be about gold now there are ten thousand different things you might want.
---
Vanilla had a simpler supply and demand.
---
That‚Äôs what I said though, SOME of these specs became more viable as things progressed. Feral tank and spriest are some of those.
---
Lol thanks, I almost clicked but then I saw your comment.
---
That's a lot of projecting dude!
---
If you mean holy aoe and shields, dont do it. I tried and it fucking blows
---
Yeah about a month
---
I think it depends on how they have built the classic engine. 
---
An actual vanilla server is no problem at all to run on modern hardware. But since they developed classic from the modern engine it could be a lot more demanding on the servers. Very hard to say unless you're an expert on these things. 
---
Vanilla was a lot more "efficient" in terms of server performance because hardware was much worse back then, it was necessary. As hardware has gotten better they have improved the engine at the cost of server resources, which is why the servers can still be laggy as fuck, despite being magnitudes more powerful than back in 2005.
---
Go clean your bong.
---
Is that baby on fire?
---
Found the Boomkin
---
I about lost it when I saw the pet's eyes hidden. Thanks for a belly laugh I haven't had in a long time.
---
I think you need to edit 1.12 to 2.0 before the angry crowd arrives.
---
That's what I had in mind. Is it just grueling? I dont mind a slow grind as long as I can do stuff.
---
What I've always heard is: 3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, 3 minutes without air
---
Now ladies...
---
I'll decide for you then.... warrior.
---
Yeah, I'm 27 and somehow learned about this way of doing seasons on this very subreddit this year. I've always thought the summer months were summer, spring months = spring etc. Don't think anyone ever told me differently in school even.
---
**Boomkin is really trash and I mean that in the most respectful way possible. Please for the love of god don't play it in PVE if you respect your raidmates. That being said, its still a great 1v1 WPVP spec and you can definitely do great with it in BGs as well assuming you go Feral Charge balance hybrid and don't actually spec into chicken.**
---
Oof
---
Never played with one who was actually serious, but from what I've heard there is basically no way to do it during progression if you want to be effective. If you are memeing about they can always carry you but you won't really be pulling wait.
---
I've heard rumor of some of the more hardcore guilds running a boomkin after they were fully progressed, with the logic being that the fights were so short that the boomkin didn't oom and therefore was more effective, but I never saw it in action and wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Warrior
---
Then if that‚Äôs the case and they add tokens to classic I‚Äôll just go back to private server hopping, simple as that.
---
It's a 'shrimp bubble' desk ornament..thingy.  I'm an old ass man working in an office TYVM.
---
Yup, we are definetly getting the easiest version of vanilla. But 30% health and 15% dmg seems way to much. Im thinking more like 10%.
---
Nefarian for example got 2 690 000 hp according to this site https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Nefarian_(tactics)
---
30% increase = 3 497 000
---
10% increase = 2 959 000
---
Definitely agree. Going back to actually taking pride in each piece of gear and having particular gear be very iconic and important is such a good aspect of old wow.
---
&gt;  the globalists use Australia as an experimentation ground
---
Yeah, sorry about that. It had to be someone so we figured Australia would do fine.
---
Ok.
---
Not sure why I am getting downvoted, just was offering my perspective as someone who vividly remembers 40 man raids and how we constructed them. Oh well, c‚Äôest la vie!
---
I bet there is some solid Fury warrior DPS, more doubtful on the 2H Warrior side.  We would let people try whatever they wanted but if they couldn‚Äôt reach a threshold DPS then we would give someone else a shot.
---
Anger management passively generates rage. It's either a bug or completely missing from the tooltip.
---
Yeah I guess that would have been true if warriors didnt exist. *Execute*
---
Me, waiting desperately for THE release date
---
(https://youtu.be/ow-WdjzfmaI)

IIRC in TBC honor was just a static currency capped at 75000 you could buy the off-pieces with. The vanilla ranks were not a thing anymore.

Well ... Dunno what to say...

Be sure to get get your salts(Sodium Chloride and Potassium Chloride) if you actually do this! I do a lot of extended fasting and if you dont get your salts(electrolytes) you will fuck yourself up hardcore.
---
I would prefer if they add transmog.  I want to be pretty, fuck your nostalgia.
---
&gt; On PvE, PvP is always consensual.
---
Except in enemy controlled zones, you're still automatically flagged. (eg: Horde in Elwynn Forest)
---
Second second life?
---
I‚Äôm trying to decide to make my Paladin either a Dwarf (both male and female are in contention), or Human female.
---
Oh really?  I did not realize that 8/8 T1 was even part of it.
---
I already run a 20/0/31 spec setup like so: https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sVxuoxZZVfotrcqo  For the situations I find myself in (in pve and pvp) and for the people I play with, it gives me the most of what I want and leaves out the least of what I wish I could have.   If we did not have enough pallys to cover all buffs and then some, I would obviously pickup imp might over benediction.
---
I've tried to play in on retrowow but I'm not spending hours and hours getting gear on a private server. I've watched videos though and it seems fun. I just hear they are really bad in pvp.
---
You do you fam.
---
Word of advice: don't throw OP's funeral in Winterspring on release. We don't need a [repeat of last time](http://marcuscarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AoIR-WoW-Funeral-Final.pdf).
---
BOTH CLASS FOR GIRL PLAY ORC WARRIOR STRONG LIKE MAN BALD LIKE EAGLE
---
There is no focus target in Classic.
---
yeah might do, i remeber it started to be so easy everyone just stopped.
---
Ah, I wouldn't of known. I played the alpha, not the beta.
---
I haven't decided, and I won't until I sit there in the character selection screen. I'll pick something, and then I'll just stick with it - just like Charlie and his soup.
---
Do you have any proof of a ranged hunter being able to out dps more NF uptime for a 40 man raid?
---
Mm, yeah, but which is the *best*?
---
My faction really decided it for me. H pally was my main from tbc through wotlk, so I'd love to experience it vanilla. But priest it is!
---
Do you plan on healing? Comfort with healing might help make your decision. Based on what I've heard and from playing both classes in later expansions, pally will be an easier time healing. Priest is a little more complex with more tools at their disposal, which I prefer. The leveling experience as a paladin, from what I've heard, also really turns me off to the class.
---
Finally, what's your class fantasy? I really don't mind the dresses that pallies wear, but I prefer the cloth aesthetic, especially since I'll be playing disc/shadow undead. 
---
Tl;dr The big 3 (after choosing a faction that supports paladins of course) to me are the type of healer you want to be, the leveling experience, and class/race fantasy. Priest checked all those boxes for me.
---
I like the part about red bull titty milk
---
In my opinion you would gimp yourself to much for shadow weave, it's just not worth it. However, disc is very viable indeed, both with and without PI. Just coordinate the PI since it doesn't stack with arcane power and some other buffs. Happy healing and good luck with the priest
---
"a fait bit"  lmao it is 5 millions time easier than heroic Uldir for instance.
---
I mean, its not only slow, it straight up does not work. You *can* do it but aoe grinding as pala is really just more of a tbc thing imo. Reckoning tho, now we talking. My lvl 50 paladin was getting corpse ganked by a lvl 60 lock once, i ran away and stacked up reckoning. Then i came back and 1 shot the guy. Took him 30 sec to figure out wtf just happened
---
Colorized History: Thrall being raised by his human care-takers circa 4 ADP (After Dark Portal).
---
My knowledge of the priest class as a whole is fairly limited, so I encourage anyone that knows more to correct me.
---
Disc in vanilla is 90% mitigation and spell damage. It's good in PvP, but the way rage works in vanilla, not so great in PvE. Your bubble stops rage gen for tanks, which inhibits their threat, and it takes a bit to get caught up on threat. In PvP, Power Infusion is quite nice, especially if there's a stacked mage running around with you, and you can deal enough damage and mitigate for teammates. 
---
Personally, I think you'd be much more valuable in 5 mans as holy for the increased healing. In Disc, there's nothing outside of PI that increases your healing done, only mana efficiency and spell damage.
---
Do you wanna summon DEMONS or BREAD?
---
nah let them come, i admit my fault, im getting old now. haha
---
I have mixed thoughts about all this.  Yes, MC and to a lesser extent BWL got easier in 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12.
---
But they weren't quite as easy as people make them out to be.  Keep in mind that AQ was made with those changes taken into account and Naxx was insanely hard in its 40 man incarnation.
---
Another big factor is the gear progression.  It wasn't a system you could "skip" tiers in very well.  As much as people try to meme, going into AQ40 with people who aren't in mostly epic gear from ZG, BWL and MC was incredibly hard.  Particularly without nature res for Huhu.
---
Going into Naxx with the same level of gear was going to wall you.  You may be able to get Instructor down because the MC mobs are OP, but you will get walled in the other 4 wings.
---
And there wasn't really a way to skip tiers like there was from WotLK on where they massively nerf the previous tier to make it hand out epics.
---
In short, yes people will clear MC fairly quick.  Maybe 2nd week.  But the progression through everything after that will still be pretty challenging.
---
And that ignores the fact that 40 man raids are still big administratively.  You need more than just 40 warm bodies to be successful.
---
alexa play despacito
---
Can I have your stuff
---
Drink that water instead. That will really show em!
---
Is that because I am putting healing aside to deal damage for shadow weaving? Do you suggest dipping into holy instead?
---
Is it more of a loss of DPS than having more NF uptime for caster though?
---
Exactly, but patch 2.0.1 the TBC pre content patch was released during vanilla. Thats why people farmed r14 weapons, here you can see my rogue inside naxxramas with the HWL sword https://i.imgur.com/etvxbmv.png
---
The servers are tuned differently and it is a modified build, they definitely need to test it.
---
Also watch this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bppGGrKAtkw&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
If you already know this stuff, sorry, but I just dont want you getting hurt. I follow this guys advice and routines to great success.
---
That PvP flag works both ways!
---
For the Alliance! :)
---
But you will pick warrior, trust me
---
I believe they confirmed "Second half of the year" in their earnings call.  June 20th therefore seems early.
---
I went and looked more in depth and it looks like the toggle was removed around the tone of 7.3.  The statements I've seen on it are because it keeping the old character models meant doubling the work of creating new animations because two versions of each needed to be made.
---
&gt;DAE look forward to classic???
---
*front page, 4k upvotes, 3 golds, 6 plats, 15,736 comments*
---
This message was sent from the future?
---
We don't know this for sure, do we? They could easily modify the addon api to match how it was in classic.
---
For me, is was more general utility. Wider variety of healing spells, offensive spells, and like Elars said, MC is too much fun. Pally blessings and really come in clutch, but lack of range, and other support, priests are a lot more flexible.
---
Decursive as it existed prior to the 2.0 (BC pre-patch) API update, was an automatic one-button spam decurse which trivialized decursing. Similar to HealBot and other addons that automated rotations and such with a single button spam. The addon API was changed to break the functionality that allowed it to operate and make automatic decisions on targeting and spellcasting.
---
WoW Classic is being built upon the modern BFA WoW client version and addon/macro API, so it will not be possible to have an addon function like Decursive did during 1.12 and prior.
---
Whats your source on 16 debuff slots, I missed that one?
---
Remember summer does not end until september
---
It would be cool if it was.
---
Unless some fuckers do it every day..
---
Way more healing options, way better Tier 2 for healing (arguably the best), overall great leveling experience. Priests also have way more offensive tools in case you need to actually attack a target which can be relevant for both leveling and pvp.
---
ofc you will, hunters are needed
---
One of my fondest memories in vanilla WoW was when we summoned my newbie friend off of a cliff in Darnassus. He had a hell of a time getting back to his body.
---
It all depends.
---
Some guilds will be months behind the leaders. They don't care about spec, consumes or skill. They just need people to show up. These are the guilds that fit your style.
---
If you want a guild with bosses on farm asap, every member will have all consumes.
---
I've been advocating for that, but ya know reeee no changes.
---
beta invites incoming
---
Well i still had 500kb until last year
---
mmmh, water fasting, easy challenge bruh
---
No one is worked up. Just speculating what it could mean
---
And if you run disc/shadow healing flash heal becomes your bread and butter
---
Will blizzard standby and let this person suffer? At what point must the pain stop?
---
Very hard.   Everything above rank 6 requires some real dedication and above rank 9 or 10  it gets into 'second job' territory.   Mind you, it's not hard from a skill point of view , just requires massive amounts  of time.  (and if you play that much pvp, chances are you get pretty skillful along the way anyway)
---
France internet is one of the worst in europe, only very big cities have a good internet the majority of the country has a very shitty connection
---
the upgrade from aurastone+lei to lok+lei is only marginally better than the upgrade from bene to lok+lei 
---
Unless you meant something completely different to what you wrote, by your own words, aurastone + lei to lok + lei is a bigger upgrade than Bene to lok+lei.
---
The first guild I was in had so much trouble getting past Magmadar. We were stuck only getting a few pitiful drops from Lucifron for weeks. We would always get really close but it just wasn't happening. We eventually got past Magmadar but by that point we had already lost a few of our top players to frustration. That guild never made it to Ragnaros before falling apart.
---
I can only imagine how much easier it would have been if we had the knowledge that we have now, and if we were able to get just a few people to spec into something that wasn't complete trash.
---
Is it even possible to reach the spell hit cap in classic?
---
there's thousands of people playing every class
---
Aq7!!
---
more abilties to use = potentially higher skill cap and more density in your gameplay. youre probably another braindead, washed up, biased mage so youre worthless here
---
look at your posting history before you talk about others... your posts are dogshit
---
I thought the polearm gave Strength in 1.12...
---
Nope. In March 2014 Blizzard announced a presale for Warlords of Draenor with the following quote: "Warlords of Draenor launches worldwide this fall". On the shopping page Blizzard specified this to "Warlords of Draenor is expected to release on or before 12/20/2014". Ion himself explained "That is the technical definition of the last day of fall."

He could easily make it 30 days on water
---
I dont think theres a chance at picking a bad server in classic, theyre gonna start with way 2 few servers so all are gonna be packed.
---
Why is this even a big deal?
---
I‚Äôm so conflicted!! I want to click this link lol
---
This guy consumed calories though via tea, coffee, soda, vitamins, etc. OP claims he will live off of only water (water has 0 calories) - in OP‚Äôs case, I believe the average is probably around the 1 week mark... my source is the Ring movies - very credible.
---
Not happening
---
not within a week, top guilds will clear it in a few hours
---
The same company that releases a shitty wow expansion, the same company that announced the Diablo mobile game, the same company that stopped supporting HoTs....
---
You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Wtf he just said he had girlfriends. Youre a little jealous i see.

Thats awesome, Id definitely use this as its what im currently trying to do right now lol. Looking through various pieces of gear to plan out a gear path for leveling, but its hard to track all the possible pieces of gear. And the on equip would be amazing to filter high end gear / raid gear comparisons as the majority of them seem to have those types of stats. But like you mentioned to have the primary stats up and running as a start would be more important, as the leveling process will be happening relatively soon in comparison to needing to compare raid gear for when bwl+ releases and the gear choices open up a lot. Either way, Im looking forward to what you create!
---
I dislike streamers as much as the next guy, but this just stupid
---
I feel like someone might guess that unstickying the post meant to calm down hype would cause even more hype.
---
All the people who tend more towards pve make it even better for us scumbag gank loving horde heads. Nothing like constantly disrupting and harassing alliance trying to actively enjoy pve experiences. I want war..craft.
---
Do it

This just in, Ion took a shit - we're one Ion shit closer to release

There also isn't a 2 hander enchant at that point so its +30ap for the enchants

I've had that problem just with glitched spawn rates on pservers, so I can definitely see how it's a problem. Look at the thunder lizzard gulch for instance, in durotar. There's 1 quest heading in there that most people skip, since it's level 12, has crap rewards, and you can just head to barrens anyway. Accidentally fall in there, and you're going to get gangbanged by level 13 lizzards till you corpse run out.
---
You can't tell me that new low pop servers see the same initial first day/week rush that the classic release will have. That's just not correct. It's a completely irrelevant argument.
---
Can you imagine?

Thanks for the reply. I did read recently that disc bubbles annihilate warrior rage and are only situationally used in raiding, if at all. I've been playing around with the talent calculator and noticed a significant loss in healing talents from not going holy. It seems that is going to be what kills this spec. I'll probably mess around with it for a bit to try it out and switch to disc/holy.

I see you're not getting much positive feedback on this, but I think it'd be pretty whether or not it ended up being successful.
---
If pubg is a basis for normal : streamer ratio then it is completely unavoidable. Just play and ignore them. Most will not last long
---
So regarding discipline - you‚Äôre both right and wrong. It is true that you rarely ever bubble warrior tanks as they generate threat when they take damage (bubble bears all you want - their rage generation stems from their damage output) and the disc tree does not really have talents to amplify your healing.
---
The way that most priests go (on private servers) is that they are holy until later on towards the end of BWL/start of AQ (as mages are usually frost/arcane power spec, and PI doesn‚Äôt stack with arcane power). If you play a 31/20/0 (PI/holy) you end up with essentially all of the healing talents of the holy tree - you only miss out on spiritual healing, which is 25% of your spirit becoming + healing. By this point in the game, while that‚Äôs about +100 healing in full raid buffs (you have about 400 spirit in t2 or equivalent gear full buffed), you already have 7-900 + healing already, so that extra bit from your spirit isn‚Äôt as relevant.
---
In 5 mans, your spec (between 31/20/0, 25/26/0, and  20/31/0) is largely irrelevant as you tend to lose effectiveness of +healing in 5 mans. This is simply due to the fact that tanks/groups take less damage in 5 mans than raids (not all the time for every pull, but for the vast majority of the time this is the case). If you‚Äôre looking at this from a ‚Äústart of classic‚Äù perspective, holy is definitely the way to go, as your gear will be worse, and you really want that increased output from talents. Only time PI spec is best for 5 mans is if you‚Äôre farming strat live with mages (as, once geared well, you can do 3 man strat live‚Äôs with a well geared tank and mage). 
---
In my opinion, all priests should start as holy, and only swap to PI spec once they 1) have the gear to make it work (about 600 +healing minimum imo) and 2) mages are a spec that can make use of it (unless your guild wants you to PI a warlock on Nef for example to chase threat if using the 1 tank method). 
---
In PvP disc is the best spec if you‚Äôre healing. 31/0/20 is the typical spec I see for the committed disc pvp priests, but the 31/20/0 spec works perfectly fine there as well - it‚Äôs just a bit more defensive than offensive.
---
Hi, /u/Thoryan
---
Jokes on them. I'm playing druid, just like I do on live. Just like I have since Classic.
---
Rule of 3's for the average joe, 3 weeks without food, 3 days without food, 3 minutes without air.
---
Hell yeah brother, I'm with you. Any streamer on the opposite faction of my server is getting sniped to shit.
---
This is always a hard and touchy subject.  One thing to note is that, with the exception of feral, all the classes can bring their buffs without going full on into the sub optimal spec.  And really it often wasn't justified even then.
---
Feral druids often had a Place because a feral could switch between dps and tank and brought a battle res/decurse.  But the rest while possible were exceedingly hard to find raid spots with.
---
True! I wish I could remember what I bought. I remember giving my mage lots of cloth and making him gear via tailoring. I'll never forget farming for some sub-60 blue chest recipe like crazy and being so happy when I made it. Man I can't wait for old professions, even if it means I'll barely get my mount by 40 lol
---
lol do i look like a nerd?
---
It‚Äôs BiS for the phase. ZG is not out in phase 3. Attack weaving being ‚Äúnot viable‚Äù is an opinion based on your own skill and perspective. In addition to being BiS PvE for hunters it‚Äôs also BiS PvP.
---
We get it. You want the neat sword. I‚Äôve never said it was t good for warriors obviously it is, for PvP.
---
&gt; Pservers which isn‚Äôt that accurate
---
Stop this meme. Private servers have had years of work put into them by hard-working fans, and while they might not be 100% they're pretty fucking close for the most part.
---
In the earning call just recently, they said classic is planned for second half of the year, and one more time confirmed its summer. how is this not an outline of a release timeline?
---
it'll come july/august.
---
Pushups during those gryphon rides. You‚Äôll get jacked on those trips to Feralas!
---
Best meme involving the sims ive ever seen.
---
Your timing and positioning needs to be perfect to about half meter and a quarter of a second for it to be a dps increase. Fuck up even slightly and you'll start losing autos and aimed shots and fall way behind the normal rotation in dps. If the boss moves at all it can get real tricky to judge the distances accurately enough.
---
100K of those accounts are gold farmers as well

Would that have been the [robe of power?](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7054)

Was thinking of going to gym for a couple of hours every other day. And of course less shitty snacks and more water + fruit.
---
I'm not a fan of the auras that pinpoint where to go, kinda feels like that
---
But I agree with you, mechanics weren't vanillas strong suit at all, outside of high level pvp of course
---
a lill bit, but not really. Was easy if people were coordinated.
---
Thanks for putting this together!
---
It's our duty as veterans to answer those questions and welcome anyone willing to play to help the sucess of classic
---
I guess this sub has wide ranges of the definition casual. IMO with addons, the mechanics are very easy and most people who raid consistently with a guild should be able to pick it up.
---
Wrong sub. This is for Owen Wilson 2000-2010 fans ONLY

*Everything we know about Classic WoW (so far) 2:13:00*

literally easy unless brainlet. stretch for a few minutes every couple hours, have a jar of raw honey and a spoon next to you whenver you need some quick energy, have uncured salami on your desk. that stuff lasts 6 months unrefrigerated, and have like 16 packs of 30 bottles of water in your closet. bam, done.
---
Haha... oh man on my rogue id cap 20 heads an hour there.
---
I'll have to admit, I stole the picture from r/gaming. But I thought it would make sense in this context as well :)
---
When there's already warriors swinging NF and losing less DPS and that the hunter would only add a slight amount of uptime? Yes, that's called common sense.
---
Came for classic , get classic BFA is the next door.

So you mean paladin every single time? That's how we get rets.

During BC I had a geriatric dog in my care. I would have to afk "dog on fire" during raids. My guild could hear the dog on vent, so they knew it was legit. I remember doing heroics with randoms all the time and getting "afk kid on fire" all the time. I swear my server was all adults with children.

That's exactly it!!! I LOVED that robe. While I'd already made Deviate Scale Belt on my hunter before, I was still so excited to finally craft that. Thank you for finding that. That brought back some great memories.

Ye, to be honest, we don't know for sure yet. It has been confirmed that they will disable all API's that contributes to macros and addons being able to make intelligent decisions. Most of these APIs were disabled with the release of TBC. It has also been somewhat confirmed that some of the new APIs that are used for addons to communicate and create social networks within the game, will be disabled as well.  
---
That's all we know atm however with that information I think it make sense to assume that they will use the modern API.
---
A couple points probably wouldn't hurt. You could also cast your mb a little early so that you can react if you get a resist
---
I think a lot of mages had the same experience haha. As long as you had the patience to farm those damn elementals in Arathi.
---
Never ran it, I levelled as holy inside a lot of dungeons at the lowest level I could get inside for the XP, along with the quests.  It's really not that hard.  And it's a hella lot more fun than trying to heal, watching a group member die than it is actually healing and watching a group gel and do teamwork.
---
Flash heal is evil, and if it's used by folks who want to heal later in the game, it's gonna be their downfall of OOM and lack of healing. 
---
Then again, I learned to heal when I had to gauge who need healed, how much they needed healed, keep weapons swapping, watch trinkets, inner-focus, and do defense with fears and shackles.
---
Best was when I pulled Strath as a holy priest in half-blues and greens with shackle for a new tank, and ran back to the tank with a timed fade.
---
But then, we made our own fun.
---
the way i see it, is that there is more novelty when its an "official server", like it somehow adds more to the experience. and a fresh launch is always fun. you get to race and be competitive with other people and do world pvp while leveling. i always did that in every fresh mmo release. its great.
---
Nobody knows, but it's provocative....it gets the people going!
---
Nope. Go tell a warrior that they have to sit in range and spam Shoot Bow all night because it helps the raid's DPS. Good luck finding someone that is willing to do that. Especially when another class can do it just as good without completely gimping their DPS. 
---
There's no point in having hunters swing NF when Warriors can do it for practically the same uptime and without massively gimping their DPS.
---
None of the decent or top guilds use NF hunters in their raids. Not even &lt;SALAD BAKERS&gt; who are speedrunning Naxx in under 2h.
---
Seriously, have you even done raid content in a hardcore where players are actively using Nightfall or are you just talking out of your ass? If you had actual experience, you'd know this is completely false.
---

Ok, lets say we live in a world where attack weaving is viable. I am a fury warrior with the same skill that knows how to equip my ashkandi on AOE fights. My damage increase is much higher than the hunter's.
---
So you won‚Äôt need that much hit, as what most shadow weaving disc priests do is just spam rank 1 swp/mind flay to get the stacks up to 5. The rank 1 spells cost like no mana, so you just spam the button until shadow weaving hits 5 (an extra global t get the stack sup due to a resist won‚Äôt have a tangible impact). You typically want a max of +healing gear as you don‚Äôt have any holy talents. You end up flash healing most of the time (as your heal/gheal have a 3 sec cast time vs the 2.5 sec cast time of disc/holy priests).

I always took it for granted. They are different games

August 19
---
Thanks for the reply! I know for a fact I‚Äôll at least have a rogue/holy paladin duo. My third party member (mage) doesn‚Äôt seem as committed to group questing yet, but that will probably change. Grinding mobs is one of my favorite things to do while leveling, so hopefully my party will have some good synergy for that too.
---
But no actual numbers, you'd have to have the OT wearing ZG Necklace and PvP Gloves to reduce the rage cost of hamstring even then it wouldn't come close to the uptime of wing clip.
---
One ranged hunter and a OT spamming a less efficient wing clip isn't going to out dps a larger uptime of 15% magic damage for an average of 12 magic users.
---
Preserved Heads is there because in your fantasy world, it was released before 1.10 Girdle was.
---
So you would have went [Belt](https://itemization.info/item/13502) or [Belt](https://itemization.info/item/13959) -&gt; Heads or whatever other hit belt you want.  
---
I am not sure why you getting hung up on 15str 1%crit when it [already existed](https://itemization.info/item/13959), but whatever floats your boat.
---
Deathbone is BiS, flat out.  Extra def is extra mitigation, and stamina stacking was moot in vanilla pve.
---
AR was never widespread.  There was a meme about it because it was common entry level pvp weapon.  It was one of the few 3.8 speed weapons before normalization.  (This was way better than AR)[https://itemization.info/item/12796] and you probably don't even know it existed.
---
My argument is you guys have lost too many braincells playing on private servers.
---
So in your scenario, it‚Äôs BiS for both classes and no one gets priority.
---
There won‚Äôt be many people using the ‚Äúwho does more damage‚Äù logic. Obviously hunters fall off and warriors are OP for DPS.
---
Aren‚Äôt BWL 1Hs better for fury also?
---
THANK YOU BLIZZARD!
---
&gt;=(
---
All noncaster r14 2hers were always the same(41stam 26str 1%crit, a close 2nd to Ashkandi), the polearm just looked best from the front.  And this is from \~1.9.0, but no difference at 1.12.
---
You posted a glass of water as proof? I'm surprised you aren't dead already given the sheer stupidity of that post.
---
Lmao the triggered ‚Äúno changes‚Äù mentality drives me crazy. Just because blizz is changing something away from what was originally 1.12 doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs necessarily bad for the game.
---
I believe she's a famous entrepreneur
---
Yea turns out I just googled summer and it came up with the astronomical definition of summer, I didn't realize there was also a different meteorological definition as well and that neither is an official start of summer (and the fact that there's no official start of summer boggles my mind). I do know that when software development companies give date ranges they use the literal definitions, they also generally land towards the end of whatever range they give.
---
That being said July 16th seems a little more likely, but I still firmly believe it'll won't launch until at least August.
---
Have you ever played in a casual guild? We'll take 4 boomkins as long as they're here on time and consumed for every raid. Filling 40 man is the challenge for us.
---
It is and I probably should have known better.  But hey community building or some such.
---
I think people get hung up on "you need X of Y otherwise it guaranteed fail blah blah."  The reality is we did 20 man 40 mans for fun which goes to show you DO NOT need 40 optimized players.  the raid content is actually pretty easy.
---
We remember it as hard because when most people first encountered it no one knew what they were doing and a lot of people "stood in the fire"
---
I think the reality is you can bring 30 people of the right spec and easy mode all the content.  Except naxx and C'thun and maybe twin emps.
---
It was brutal, but I felt like an absolute badass having my frostbolts hit harder :p
---
I eyerolled so hard that my eyeballs slipped out of its sockets
---
Well they have not made a blue post yet. So far blizz is been going for 1.12 everything and they told us they would. Only exception being time gated 6phases of content. So i just put 2 and 2 together. I Hope to be wrong though.
---
MC was clearly tuned for 8 debuffs only.
---
I know you can't compare classic to private servers, but the 40 warm bodies to be successful isn't really true anymore. Fresh on K3 we cleared MC with 32 people the 2nd week in like 2 hours.
---
Like I said, I know you can't compare them but it's vastly easier than people are remembering.
---
Undead mage or gnome mage?
---
i guess i see the point when put that way
---
progression servers that release expansions on a time table starting from vanilla working way up Everquest 1 did this worked out great for that game
---
Ahhhhhhhhh I can't wait any longer. I can't wait to play every single night after work and lose all relationships! Classic wow I love you
---
I love wow but I don't praise every aspect of it.
---
Wait, read my post again..
---
You know it. Imagine being so irrelevant that you had to respond with the classic ‚Äúso edgy‚Äù to my comment to OP. Hot take.
---
Oof oh yeah, good point! Thanks for the reply. Might have to take 5 or 10 minutes and just heal party members while they auto attack to level up weapons every once in a while. The mage in my party not so much, but my friend‚Äôs rogue will definitely not want to lag behind with that.
---
no it's going super saiyan
---
Found a californian
---
just a suggestion not a troll I just think progression servers would be cheaper for both consumer and blizzard alike.
---
Disc is mana Regen. 99% of priest will be putting a fair number of points into that tree.
---
not until Cata.  
---
When I think causal I think of the people struggle boating through the content where that extra 400dps will actually mean the difference between a clear and a wipe.
---
that  is fair and having reliable people is the hardest part of raiding to be sure.
---
This is correct.  On PVE servers there were some areas you would auto-flag if you entered them.
---
Because you didn‚Äôt need to, it hurt you more than helped.  Get some stamina enchants, and rely on your healers.  Keep a Paladin back, OOC, to Rez the occasional death so pulls can continue non stop.  Easy.
---
Same as PvE, but people could freely attack you in contested zones
---
Yea, but they were like $1500+ when the entire computer was $200
---
You also could get PVP flagged for attacking the wrong NPC.
---
To make a better point, they're still there if you open the game in the model viewer.
---
I‚Äôm waiting for launch personally, I‚Äôd rather join it through meeting people and being comfortable with my own character.
---
Rushing to 60 for early mc raiding will just burn me out of classic, I want to enjoy it.
---
Yea I just googled summer and got the astrological Summer dates, I didn't realize there were also different Meteorological dates and that neither are the "official" dates of summer
---
I have distinct memories of my Night Elf Hunter running around Darnassus listening to Aerosmith as a 12 year old.
---
Rolling a druid for classic so I guess I'm gonna bust out some Aerosmith while on that tree
---
Nope, check legacy logs. Hunter melee is for noobs
---
Yes, holy is the spec the class is build around. It got powerful tools for all occasions but mostly healing. Shadow is (imo) a spec you go die-hard to do or not at all. 
---
A holy priest is truly magnificent..
---
Same reason that they updated every single interface package.  "Find and Replace". 
---
Try looking at the actual codebase he's making grandiose claims about, and you'll see its simply that they haven't done the work for most of the interface packages yet.
---
Goldshire on RP realms would like to have a word with you.
---
Pro tip: Take some salt with it.
---
Thanks for the insight! Luckily, I still have plenty figure it all out.
---
The immersion, community and since of progression are what I care about most. As long as the core design philosophy is untouched I'll be happy. Tweaking a few numerical values so bosses are harder or making oomkins/ret not suck isn't going to somehow ruin my game experience. I really don't understand the stupidly strict "no changes" crowd.
---
well yeah...because for 4/5 of vanilla druids were godawful tanks that had tools to be a tank but no way to tank since they were too squishy with practically no armor bonus in bear form and pitiful amount of armor in Dire Bear form.
---
They didn't get good until Naxx's patch. And people actually did start experimenting with them, but you have to be aware of their strength, weaknesses, and how you heal them vs how you heal a warrior.
---
There were niche fights before 1.11 you could tank with a druid, but they either resistance fights or had some gimmick the druid's mechanics could exploit.
---
Post 1.11, they are solid tanks but they work differently than a warrior does.
---
Since how you heal them is different. You don't worry so much about keeping them at 100% hp, since they have the HP and Armor to take hits that back to back would kill a warrior. 
---
Druids are better healed with Hots, and keep them hovering around 75% maximum HP. Which lets the hots get their full efficiency instead of largely being wasted on overheal. And only direct healing the spikes from crits or crushing blows.
---
They make solid off-tanks through out all content, post buffs, and can even MT fights that prior to the buffs they never would've been able to.
---
And you can't completely ignore PS data, as a lot of results bare out results people were already seeing in actual vanilla during the Feral Druid experiments, but those cut short short due to the 2.0.1 patch which changed every. The exact results are probably wrong due to the differences in server, but given the closeness of the the vanilla ones, there some credence that, given more time, Druids would have been stepped up.
---
So you are mistaking online population cap with active players. If I play 3 different characters at different times there is only 5k on the whole time but I have 3 active pvpers in my faction. As well if Jimmy can only play 2 hours a week and gets on pvps then logs. And then sam gets on pvps. Now you have over 5k active. Nostalrius had a peak of like 12k but had over 100k active players over the course of a week. Now that was all regions etc. But on a 3k server you are looking at probably 10-15k+ active players minimum
---
I wanted to get one of those but I didn‚Äôt know how long the shrimp would be around. They‚Äôre a bit pricey so I didn‚Äôt wanna drop the cash on them only to have them die after a while. I am also an old ass man working in an office right now.
---
There's been no mention of Arenas or the Azshara Battleground either.

This might have given a more varied response if you posted it on the standard wow subreddit or the games subreddit rather than the one dedicated to people interested in classic wow
---
Not minmaxing =/= Trash. Take that elitist stick out your ass mate
---
Well unless people start copyrighting memes, youre all good.
---
What i'm wondering is that you how can now for a fact that the DMG calculations are that off? like the difference that would exist according to you would be huge and i don't understand how u are able to to know for a fact that it is THAT much different?
---
i will see how it goes but if DMG is screwed as you say it does not only affect Feral and therefore we gotta see how big the difference is. I'm certainly sure there is but not that much of a difference so i will not be able to play Feral dps because i'm only top 15-20 DPS. I sadly stopped playing Feral as soon as Naxx hit our Server so i can't say much about the itemization in Naxx. But prior that, every gear offers new insane gear and especially BWL is insane(DFT). But let's be honest, every one hunts for that item and depending on ur system ur either save a lot of DKP(which is easy as Feral as ur not rolling for Tier sets) or u Prove urself to do very good in raids, otherwise i don't see a world in a Feral getting this item early.
---
What other fights do you not recommend fr gear because "it hurt you more than helped"?
---
I know the alpha male theory was debunked by its own author but this is a new one for me.
---
PvP servers were more fun and organic. You could want to do certain quests but be prevented by gankers, skirmishing and outright warfare. That's not some people's cup of tea but I loved it because it felt like a real place where everyone could influence each other's actions.
---
Why would blizzard want to get more money by creating something that there is already a market for? Seems kind of obvious.
---
I approve of this message.
---
This isn't really a thing ime. Most bosses are not very hard, DPS checks will be met late anyway because we're spending our time trying to fill our roster and let go entire lockouts without any progression attempts.
---
Having 40 dedicated players, no matter the spec, would be a godsend and we'd progress much faster simply because we could make use of our raid times more efficiently, we wouldn't have to re-explain bosses to new people every week, we wouldn't have new people falling over and dying every week because it's their first time, shit like that.
---
They also said the second half of the year which excludes June. That leaves a release window of July-September. It doesn't matter what the people think Summer means, it matters what timeframe they technically have to work within and that timeframe includes September.
---
&gt; Same as PvE, but ~~people could freely attack you~~*you can gank poor bastards* in contested zones
---
that would be epic XD #nochanges tho
---
Weren't those more of a bug-fix?  IIRC you had to do some stupid shit to stop him from evading that was fixed.
---
I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  I just have not seen it be successful myself and don't know guild in live that did. I knew a couple guys who were incredible players that just couldn't mitigate the elemental damage on fights and would get vaped on certain mechanics.
---
However, I love when people find new things that change the meta so I hope that Feral Tanks become viable in classic that would be awesome.  
---
I feel like in live everyone was so ready for TBC that they went in to coasting mode after their first clear of Naxx so pushing the envelope just died until the new talents came out.
---
Just gonna repost the top post last month huh.

I will be chillin at Steamwheedle beach and look at my night elf huntress undressing her leather bikini and put on the green boots while fishing.

I always kept some nice peaces in my bag/bank, too nice to vendor..
---
Yea fuck the private server players and their accurate info. This sub is for retail WoW champions to post misinformation based on their 15 year old memories of the game!
---
They still need to level up in a new server with competiton for mobs and no previous gold/gear.
---
Fruit and especially dry fruit is basically candy tho. :P
---
I think that‚Äôd be fine, but we have no idea how hard/easy everything is going to be. Wait until a server has completed a full cycle
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER

PvP servers are more "swingy" than PvE. Some days you keep getting ganked and it can be really frustrating. But other days you can experience some great open world PvP and have a lot of fun experiencing something outside of dungeons. And I would never want to miss out on an event like the first spawn of Azuregos or Lord Kazzak without the crazy open world PvP fights over them.
---
Also keep in mind that PvP servers will generally attract a much more hardcore crowd than PvE servers for various reasons, including much faster ranking for R14 weapons.
---
We think we do, but we don't
---
Thanks for the reply! Yeah i feel like it‚Äôs all in play style. If schedules line up well with friends it‚Äôs a blast. If not, it can make group leveling really slow and not fun. Hopefully schedules don‚Äôt change so we have a good time! If not, I‚Äôll play solo. I have always shied away from General/trade chat groups because of no trust with loot drops. Maybe this time around I‚Äôll be a little more trusting with it.

---
This was an awesome reply! I'm on board. Priest it is!
---
I never said warriors get prio because they do more damage overall. I was simply making a counterpoint to your argument that everybody in the game is a hyper-efficient DPS'er. Think of all the damage a warrior could do in AOE fights swapping in Ashkandi if that were the case. A hunter's gain wouldn't even be close to the warrior's gain.

I . . . ah . . . ok. Does this fall under some sort of prohibition on promoting self-harm though? I mean, I get it, and, assuming you're probably not really going to starve yourself for the sake of a game, I appreciate the sentiment. But I feel like this probably is not something either Blizzard or the mods of this sub want to be seen as enabling.
---
Ofc not, dont be silly!
---
**ALL Blizzard UI .TOCs had their version changed to 11300, not just this one.** Since the UI files were taken from the BFA client and are still in development.
---
Whomever took this screenshot and posted it here is just spreading FUD. This isn't proof one way or another of WoW token being available in Classic. Unless Blizzard says something official, don't freak the fuck out based on nothing.
---
Great points, between this answer, and others here, I'm officially convinced. Thanks buddy.
---
Agreed. While some values are inevitably off, there are a ton of advantages practicing on a pserver. I for one, have a much better understanding of what class I want to play based on flavor and end game viability, and also how I plan to stack gold early
---
You are not taking in to account all The private servers combined, from years and years, plus the tbc/wraith/mop/cata servers. I think you are massivly underrating the explosion this game is going to make, but we are all just speculating. I could be wrong, i could be right. We will see
---
Nonono RELEASE CONFIRMED JUNE 12 how could you net see that‚Äôs obviously what this means?
---
I don't even think top guilds will need to farm bis gear to clear MC
---
They'll just do a few dungeon runs and clear it with half greens
---
BWL will obviously be cleared within hours
---
Disappointing. This lack of real news is an indicator of how far we are from a beta. If the newest development is the decision of the character limits, they haven't even started working on the real in-depth details. I wouldn't be surprised if we got the game on the very last day of summer... is what I would say if I wasn't optimistic that we're getting another blue post today!
---

---
I always remember Booty Bay for example.  The fear.....  and the fun.  Plus hiding.
---
Get out nowwww
---
If Goldshire could talk....
---
Prog servers are a really lazy and shoddy way to implement a "classic" version of a game, and I say that as a huge fan of EverQuest.
---
They're more of a competition to see who can clear through expansions the fastest, but they don't offer an actual classic experience. A better EQ example would be Project 1999.
---
Definitely planning on healing! I mained a druid from Vanilla to MoP, hence my indecision about what class to play now lol. But overall I enjoyed healing the most, followed by PvP, followed by tanking, followed by just regular dps. So I do enjoy a tiny bit of tanking, but mostly I'm about healing, PvP, and enjoying the levelling process. The tanking isn't a make or break thing.  
---
I think I've decided on priest, thanks for the help.
---
If the game does drop in a few months I plan to be a try hard.  lol.
---
It‚Äôs a little of column A and B but also depends on the specialization. I think it‚Äôs practically undeniable that Tribal LW has the best patterns and the ones worth the most money viz profitability. Dragonscale is probably second due to it being mail oriented. Tribal LW just gets better and better as time goes on especially when you can make quite decent resistance gear for AQ and Naxx. Of course, Hide of the Wild is the best healing cloak some people will ever get, and is insanely profitable to make if you get the pattern early.
---
I cant argue that logic i guess again was just curious why not give us classic now instead of in the summer via progression servers.
---
Wait so you can buy the mount and dont have to be R11
---
Oh I agree it was one of the best designed raids. I only really played vanilla and TBC though.
---
Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth are bis for Hunters
---
To be honest
---
Who doesn't?
---
Dwarves are such a badasses with brutal beards and HUGE Axe or Mace in hands 
---
And their voices are masterpiece
---
SHARDING?!?!
---
I hope they don't pull a "technical definition of the last day of summer" to justify a late release.
---
RIP
---
You are still misunderstanding.
---
When they said MC will be cleared within a week, they are talking since the server day 1, when all reaiders will still be level 1.
---
They'll need to level up to 60 from scaratch with no gear or gold before trying to attempt MC. That's where most of the week will be spent.
---
&gt; HUGE Spellbook,
---
I know, I also know that most of the time you use 2 or 3 spells at max.
---
Yes really. I'm not saying that eating 1 or 2 bananas or whatever are equal to a snickers bar but fruits in general are full of carbs and high on calories (dry fruit is the worst).
---
Are PVP servers better to play on for a normalized economy?  AKA no Chinese botters messing it all up.
---
Careful friendo, may want to edit that last sentence there to not break sub reddit rules.
---
You're not limited to just a single OT in the raid either. Come back when you have an actual argument. Wing Clip isn't magically better than Hamstring either. They're the exact same. An instant attack limited by the GCD that is fully spammable.
---
A fury offtank with Flurry+Hamstring spam will have better uptime AND better DPS than a hunter. You don't need to reduce Hamstring's cost because you are able to generate enough rage from white hits, especially when you proc Flurry nonstop from Hamstring spam. 
---
You keep saying that Hunters are better at uptime than warriors yet you don't provide any proof that back up your argument, and no guild uses Nightfall hunters, not even the best guilds. Burden of proof is on you.
---
I agree the gathering quests have potential to drag on for a while. For me though, the leveling experience as a whole will probably be smoother in a group than solo. Easy dungeon grouping, easy mob grinding, faster elite quests, and fun banter while on the road all seem to outweigh the cons. See you in classic!

I actually think experimenting with builds and trying your own thing is way more important than just copying the top cookie cutter builds and classes.

You would need a classic version of wow to start out on, which is what blizzard is creating right now.
---
&gt;I hear you, my holy brothers. I really like the class fantasy, but not sure about the entire "autoattack until death" thing. I may be wrong about that one though, convince me!
---
I plan on leveling two characters, a warlock on my own, and a priest with a relative of mine (who isn‚Äôt great at WoW but has experience). What spec would be best for duoing through quests and leveling dungeons?
---
Because they don't have classic ready now, classic is not whatever you see in current BFA Warcraft in only the classic zones. That's not classic, they can't just put that over. Some assets they were able to salvage or Port over but others they had to remake from scratch. Also I'm pretty sure it's a smaller team than a traditional expansion so it takes longer.
---
Anything to bring a smile to my fellow WoW players in these trying times while we wait for Classis.
---
I believe Alpha was kept too
---
Ahh ok now im seeing the light thank you
---
You need to have reached rank 11 to purchase an epic pvp mount
---
People should avoid ONLY big "variety" streamers but not small and medium dedicated Classic-exclusive streamers.
---
I get the impression you haven't actually tried to use that rotation in a raid and compared the dps. I've raided a vanilla hunter for years and never been able to eek out more than a few dps playing with melee nonsense. If there was a gap between my dps and other hunters I might try to perfect it, but most bosses I'm in the top 5 for hunters and usually by pretty thin margins
---
Right now I think winds of winter is going to come out before wow classic..
---
Shaman uses nightfall in my guild mr. Hunters are way too good of dps to waste on doing melee attks you are?
---
I remember the first time I came upon Gadgetzan - it was so cool! Just a random Goblin city way down on the south of this continent. A little refuge after a long journey before another one to the West.
---
no. hes saying buy a different mount
---
no debate for me, PVP servers made this a whole other experience, the grind of 1-60 could be long and hard, some world pvp made the experience magical instead of tedious.
---

i have a home gym, so i think im going to make a point of taking 1 hour 5 days a week to work out. its exactly 1 hour, not 1 hour of excersise and 30 mins of travel time and 10 mins of getting ready and 10 for a shower. i mean, /camp 1 hour and im back in. which is pretty handy. I might also do some meal prep? (unlikely, lots of healthy places deliver near me) i would also walk the dogs everyday.
---
Yeah exactly! And PvE just didn't feel like a real world to me because it didn't have the unpredictability.
---
We're comparing to TBC not retail. Yes retail raids are way way harder. 
---
&gt;It was my understanding that WoW Vanilla was fairly similar to TBC raiding in terms of difficulty. Is that the case?
---
A PI / Holy build similar to this is what you'll want for PvP healing. You an move a few points around, but this is the general idea. If you want something more unconventional, try Disc + Silence 30/0/21. It's more about utility / support and less about healing.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioobhtsc
---
You clearly have zero idea what you're talking about.
---
With tokens, wallets don't determine the economy, the gold isn't created out of thin air, it's taken from someone else. It's a zero-sum exchange that doesn't impact anything. Someone had to earn that gold through in-game means at some point. It's no different than someone buying gold from another player because that's exactly what they're doing, just with the RMT exchange going through Blizzard instead of paypal or otherwise.
---
Not sure why this argument is still taking place when Tokens have been a thing for years now on retail and the only thing it managed to accomplish is the demise of the WoW gold seller industry while giving players who are good at earning gold an alternative to paying for their subscription (by being subsidized by whomever is buying their token with real money).
---
I might have a bit of a hardcore perspective on this. First time my pserver guild got a sub 1h MC clear was with 8 debuffs and early game stats on gear. 
---
So i do feel that a substantial buff would be better than a slight one but i was just shooting from the hip with the 30%. It would require testing by Blizzard to get it right.
---
One major difference is that the wow account is tied to your bnet account now. Getting banned in wow for gold selling/buying has a different connotation than it did when you got banned in vanilla.
---
Why is the Mountain Dew only a 2 day supply?

Well I won‚Äôt be taking any diet advice about the healthiness of grains from the guy telling people to eat salami.

I think it comes down to what changes might come if they do start tweaking the vanilla experience. I‚Äôd love for Ret and Boomkin to be valid as much as the next guy, but where does it end? LFD? Personal loot? All the ‚Äúconveniences‚Äù of retail that killed the community?
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù arguments and I do think that the Classic experience can be improved without breaking the game, but I can understand why the purists don‚Äôt want anything to change. Much better to get an unbalanced game which was at least fun than to get something watered down like the retail game has become.
---
Actually, if you really want to do yourself good, you should go on a hunger striker after it releases.  That way you can lose weight (hopefully you need some) and not have to take unnecessary time away from playing.
---
Yes! The memory of climbinb up the windy, desert road to the sandstorm blowing rough, the Tanaris zone music and the whacky Goblin city of Gadgetzan.. A very visceral and personal memory of mine. I was in complete awe at this world.
---
Nice choice. I love holy paladin. So much so that I stayed holy spec 100% of the time from vanilla through wotlk haha.
---
No you won't.
---
There isn't really much to be done about this. Taking just Druids as an example ‚Äì do we want every Druid to feel pressured to go to the 41 point resto talent to get Innervate again? Or do we want Warlocks to be gimped until the warlock patch again?
---
In the end I think the cat's out of the bag either way. Gimping Druids or leaving Greater Heal uncompetitive isn't going to change world firsts that much.
---

There was a reset in September 2014. You're technically correct because Alpha lasted until January 2015, but I played at the beginning.

Remember to take your time in this game and enjoy the journey to 60. Rushing through this game isn't the correct way to play. Don't let others tell you how to play the game and make sure you play through it slowly... the correct way!

---
I am saying Melee damage is inflated on Pservers.  Which means feral too. There is some really weird jankiness that happens on Pservers with all the armor debuffs.  I am assuming Blizzard used some kind of alpha scaling where Pservers are either using additive or multiplicative scaling on armor reduction.
---
I wish i still had my old screen shots of guild parses but those went away 4 computers ago didn't think they would be relevant again. Numbers that guilds are posting and individual DPS scores I have seen on Pservers are WAY higher than I remember even the most geared of my Naxx guildies and the stuff getting posted on the progression forums at the time.
---
But agreed anecdotal. I cannot tell you 100% that feral won't be top 5 I can tell you it never happened in my circles in live. Classic will show us whats what.
---
#Its not dropping in Summer. It sucks but it‚Äôs time to face facts
---
YOU BEAT ME TO IT! Well played sir!
---
The melee weaving mechanics can add as much as 10-15% damage increase if you execute it correctly. There are some fights were it is better to just do the standard rotation but you are just being lazy if you never do it.
---
Ah, didn't recall. I have the level 40 alpha portrait (I think it was lvl 40?) and I didn't remember having to relevel characters.
---
Female dwarf casting animations are actually amazing. No other race gets helicopter braids. Highly recommended, Fear Ward and Stoneform are just gravy.

We're using the modern engine which has it and I highly doubt they'd remove it for authenticity or anything like that. There's no gameplay reasons to get rid of it (it's not an LFG style tool).

This matches very well with what Mark Kern said during ClassiCast.

---
Choose a faction first
---
seriously though should i go warrior or try to play fire mage as much as possible. i need a class that doesn't require a bajillion groms or trash grinding or playing frost too much.
---
Yeah, PVP could be incredibly frustrating but it was also a lot more of a full experience with some of my favorite moments only being possible because of the mechanics of a PVP server, in my mind its the only choice.
---
A lot of people romanticize PvP servers, I think. Yes there are some awesome times where you get into impromptu battles with the other faction around your level, but I'd say the majority of your "PvP" experience while leveling will be getting ganked by someone much higher level than you, or someone waiting for you to engage a mob so they can 2v1 you. 
---
That being said, I'd never want to level without it. Despite how insanely frustrating it gets sometimes, the times where you and some randoms from your faction team up and take down some guys from the other faction are way worth it.
---

---
She is a great research subject, but only for scientist.
---
Press **[F]** to pay respects.
---
Back in my day, we had to walk uphill, both ways, in the lava, to get to our raids, and we liked it that way!
---
Oh man I had totally forgotten about this lol
---
Looks like prime PvP realestate to me.
---
What? Ofc we do.
---
Lag, login queues, server crashes and other oddities. 
---
Servers were overwhelmed and you just took what you could get if you got logged in.
---
Gold farmers are typically not well geared, and definitely not well suited for pvp, on a pve server there's nothing you can do except compete with them, on a pvp server you can gank the everliving shit out of them and make them log / go somewhere else while also farming -- they aren't likely to retaliate as they have gold quotas to make and can't be wasting time fighting you.
---
Some mechanics are hard to recreate exactly, that is true. But in terms of damage values and so on they are very accurate. It is reasonable to expect that some statistics will change, but not by a huge margin. The big question marks are not on the level of "which class does what kind of damage in this gear and raid".
---
I challenge anyone who thinks otherwise to do the research themselves: Read the code, check the evidence, try to find inaccuracies based on your observations, or simply fact check the values and logic that pservers apply.
---
No, it starts with adding LFR, LFD tool, welfare epics, etc etc etc. These are not small changes
---
Holy shit and here I am almost getting raped by my girlfriend because I‚Äôm never in the mood and to tired after work.
---
The whole "slippery slope" thing is such a specious, lazy argument, too.   Those people *firmly* believe in a logic analogous to "Because I know you break the law by speeding, I can safely assume you beat the shit out of your wife every night."
---
\^ this guy gets it
---
If you are comparing yourself only to the hunter's in your raid, then yes, you are fine... Vanilla isn't hard, you don't need to min/max to down bosses, you can get away with people pulling subpar dps as long as they can mostly follow mechanics. 
---
It depends what your goals are...
---
Except I'm not wrong. I'm sorry you don't understand the economics of the situation nor possess the reading comprehension to understand what I'm saying.
---
I wasn't advocating for Tokens to be in Classic, I'm just correcting your false assertion that Tokens ruin the economy, because they have a net-zero impact on the economy by being a zero-sum exchanged between players through Blizzard as a middle-man.
---
Gold sellers existed in Vanilla, and did ruin the economy due to their botting to farm up the gold. Tokens killed gold sellers. To say that Tokens in Classic would be a bad thing is naive. Classic's return will make gold that much more valuable again (just as it is on private servers), and the Gold sellers will most assuredly try to set up shop in Classic if Tokens aren't included. Which means bots, spam, and increased incentive for account theft. All things that the introduction of Tokens have largely impacted positively in Retail.
---
You just made me realize I can pay for my Classic subscription with retail tokens since it‚Äôs the same subscription. My millions of retail gold means something again after all these years!
---
Low effort and impossible
---
Classic will be released during this years summer, so the earliest date could be 21.06 (or 06.21 for my American friends), but I guess that's unlikely.
---
My guess is that they will release the beta during June and that Classic will be launched somewhere between 15.07 - 15.08.
---
Hey man it seems like you didn‚Äôt get it from the two last posts of mine.
---
The token wasn‚Äôt in the original game, if they add it, I‚Äôll switch back to a private server. 
---
Simple as that.
---
Ur still gonna get rolled by people who played on LH
---
Agreed. imo, even some of the purists might be okay with it. Many people don't want changes that would make the game easier. I think they'd be okay with it being harder, especially if that feels more like OG molten core when we were all noobs and tanks had spirit on their armor sets.
---
Ya if they don't make their gold quota they probably will get beaten by the security guards and lose out on their meal for the day.

A very detailed list of all the gear and comparisons of them.
---
OP, was your warrior's name WallaceMartin by chance? Your memory sounds exactly like my guild's first Vael kill in BWL.
---
I think we do. The overall dps output of certain classes in certain gear will not change by much, because that stuff is pretty well observed and checked. Those things are very educated guesses that reflect the evidence on the surface. There will obviously be some minor shifts but don't expect it to have any impact on the level of class balance, except for very specific edge cases.
---
Agreed balance Bear was frustratingly good in pvp
---
I think its assumed we will have roughly Vanilla era server pop caps, its just all but confirmed in writing.
---
Never said it was. What I said was that high fidelity textures aren't the same as old textures. Aka, a change
---
I did loads of nature res armor sets when AQ hit, both in vanilla and nost

"The Al'ar encounter has been significantly reworked. Her movement around the room will now be more predictable, Al'ar's hit points have been reduced, and killing the Embers of Al'ar will now be both much more possible and more rewarding to the raid."
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.1.0
---
From my memory, the changes were far greater than this suggests, though.
---
reminds me of requiem for a dream
---
Blindmode is an obvious thing to add and it's toggleable, you wont see it if you dont want to. People complaining about it are just being edgy.
---
As far as mass mail, and things like Auto loot. Leave them original in my opinion. The difficultly and slowness of things did create the environment so I'm in the as pure as possible camp.
---
Great, we'll all be having fun on Classic while you try to find people to play with on private servers which will most likely be dead as fuck with most people switching to official Classic.
---
Better question is who losses more dps, a hunter or a warrior. Warrior can still put up decent numbers with a two hander, a hunter will do little more than auto attack damage.
---
Using a nightfall or 2 is a no brainer for raid dps though unless you are very short on casters
---
Stealing all your NPCs
---
Kinda counts here... in Vanilla I mained a mage. In Alterac Valley, I looked at the raid group and noticed 4 other mages, so I asked for raid lead and swapped the 4 mages into my group. 
---
After a bit of convincing, we formed the stealth mage assassin group! I led the group and had them all follow-me on the far side of the map through the mine field that used to exist. 
---
We went behind enemy lines and I talked through how we would time our AOE moves (blink in, blast wave, arcane explosions, etc...).  At this point, the majority of both raids were in huge groups at a standoff. 
---
On my count, we blinked in to the Alliance from behind and timed our AOE and wiped out 30 people in an instant with our 5 man mage group. 
---
It is to this day my best memory from Vanilla.
---
would be nice if we could have both big and medium servers
---
If I had to describe how Hunters are viewed in raiding, I would basically say that you should never expect to "Be the Hero." It will definitely feel like a large part of your purpose is to support other classes, but it's pretty fun.
---
Hunters are very fast and easy levelers. If you really wanted to, you could use a macro to do Autoshot + Hunter's Mark + Pet Atack and wait 20 seconds for the mob to die. Generally speaking their DPS is the lowest out of the four dedicated DPS classes, Mage Rogue, and Warlock being the others. Other than their ability to kite and use tranquilizing shot, Hunters are primarily brought for their buff, Trueshot Aura, which provides attack power to all five members of the Hunter's party. In raids, groups are set up to maximize buff coverage. Priest, Mages, etc. don't need attack power, so Hunters will always be grouped with melee classes like Rogues and Warriors; the same principle applies for Warriors and Battle Shout. The same goes for pet abilities like the Wolf's Furious Howl, which increases damage on nearby party members' physical attacks.
---
With that said, having any more than 4 Hunters isn't very common. The Hunter class is very satisfying to play due to autoshot weaving, especially when compared to something like a Mage spamming Frostbolt. The PvE skillcap for a Hunter is much higher than the ol' "Huntard" attitude you'd expect. Both are fun in different ways, but the Hunter is usually much more interactive.

---
There‚Äôs a spot for them for sure, but my point was that there are so many hunters since they are by far one of he easiest classes to level rhat it is hard to find a spot as a hunter. It‚Äôs not that they are bad just supply and demand.
---
Not my raid, every hunter that uploads on the server
---
I've got a small spreadsheet for something like that. I plan on sending ALL of my cloth mats I'll need for levelling tailoring 1-300 and for Truefaith vestments, as well as all herbs for alchemy 1-300, to bank alts. Gonna level herb/skinning, at 60 drop skinning for tailoring, level that 1-300 with the mats I've stored away (might need to farm a bit of runecloth still at 60, but that's fine), and then once I've got truefaith I'll drop that in favor of alchemy since alch is fun.
---
It's hard because it's a test of willpower. You have to be PvPing more than anyone else on your server (and doing well) to achieve a high rank. If you are able to no-life PvP for whatever reason for 15-20 hours a day you shouldn't have a problem.
---
I used to play ret paladin from wotlk untill legion, then i quit. Mostly played pvp but did my weekly dungeons as well and the random raid once in a while.  Mostly enjoyed pvp as i come in a fight, pop some defensive utilities if needed and still hit pretty hard. Feel like a half tank and half hard hitter. idk how to really explain it lol, but is vanilla ret paladin the same?
---
Yes I know but it said MC adn BWL, this doesn't apply to BWL
---
So i said in a general sense, when players will get into the raid, it will be cleared in a few hours
---
Oh I see.. what's like, the most demanded class that isnt gonna be over played tho
---
Gotta downvote inaccurate information
---
The Steamwheedle Cartel would like a word with you...
---
I'm gonna channel my inner 2004 self and say "pics or it didn't happen" bro.
---
Priest isn't very different. Pally uses judgement on CD (good burst of damage there), applies seal to augment damage, and auto attack for the rest of the HP. Priest applies DoT, maybe a MB, and then wands to death which is basically just another form of auto attack. Priest certainly has more dps but you'll still be auto attacking a lot either way.
---
Besides Pally is a more mana efficient healer anyway so that's less hassle there at least.
---
Sure. I can respect that. (:
---
Ultimately, people will enjoy playing WoW differently. I won't be speed running anything, but the way you described your dungeon experience is definitely not my cup of tea either. :/
---
I personally prefer dungeon groups where everyone is playing their absolute best and is trying to get to the last boss as fast as possible, BUT where we also aren't stressing and can still chat. \^\^
---
Yeah my guild could barely every fine 30 English speaking warm bodies for Mc lol

This has to be satire because ... well actually I can believe someone would be dumb and/or petty enough...

PvP servers just add another element to the world. The positives out weigh the negatives.
---
Pros:
---
Fight over resources and world bosses
---
wPvP 
---
 1. make new friends
---
 2. adds danger to questing/gathering/traveling
---
 3. provides extra entertainment
---
Cons:
---
Being ganked low hp by someone without skill (usually)
---
Being rez camped usually by someone higher than you (you might have killed his alt or he is just bad/mad)
---
getting into a fight during an escort ugh!
---
The downtime community was a thing. Forums were hopping. Podcasts firing up. Wow Radio. Taverncast etc.
---
I've been rewatching all the 2004/2005 wow content from the past to get fired up even more for classic!
---
You‚Äôre stupid and I hate you.
---
Yeah! Now get ready for loot drama.
---
They were 2.5-3k or so?  I'm hoping it's a little higher (maybe 1k?) simply so that we have fewer realms to begin with, would prefer things are a little overpopulated to begin with vs having some realms die off and requiring realm xfers down the road.
---
I'd join your great hunger strike, but uhh, I weigh 150 pounds and I've got a life to live still.
---
but they are interfering with my farm!
---
What‚Äôs the point of Reddit if we can just google everything?
---
Did they even specify which timeline they'll release it in? I really hope it's this one.
---
Seriously that shit got ugly.
---
Theres gonna be more drama itll just be localized
---
then we would get mind controlled and run straight back into the lava lol
---
Yeah. Even in the heyday of vanilla, we did a lot of MC runs with ~20 skilled players and 20 warm bodies. We'd pull in PUGs to fill the raid, and we had some guildies who were pretty terrible. We had one guildie who was color blind and kept running into the lava, so he would just AFK during fights that he couldn't see well.
---
That was a couple of months after launch, so not with overgeared players or anything. Being able to rez during combat made most of MC pretty noob-friendly. Sometimes we'd resurrect the same character four or five times during one fight.
---
Your grandparents went on hunger strikes for a 2-day weekend, your parents went on hunger strikes for an end to segregation, and you're hunger striking because a re-release of a 15-year old video game isn't happening as quickly as you want.
---
So when TBC comes out and I redo the Vanilla content with TBC rules, do I start on a new server or create a second account?
---
Nobody cares about specs in 5mans. I've met like one special kind of guy who complained about a spec in a dungeon.
---
And in raiding guilds it depends. BM Hunters do more damage than others in pre-raid-BiS, so I personally wouldn't complain at that stage.
---
I am almost certain that they literally did confirm that they meant the northern hemisphere... I don't have any evidence ready though.
---
Hehe it was a bit tongue in cheek, I‚Äôm rolling Dwarf Priest baby!
---
I find the lack of tendies unacceptable.
---
Something I found really handy that I vendors a lot  when I first started were scrolls and food that give buffs.  About the first 6 months I played vanilla, I burned through these, sometimes throwing them away even! Good luck out there!
---
&gt; Also gearing and classes were more balanced. Even though there existed a min-max meta, raiding was less time consuming (even though
---
For me it was sunwell. Shadowpriest that was stuck on muru reporting in. We wiped so many weeks there and it was still so exiting and fun. The day they put out the nerf and we cleared it the first try, together with the final boss (dont even remember his name becauses we only did it once and abandoned) was so unbelievably heartbreaking.
---
I remember having almost exactly 1700 dps on brutallus so many years later (the dps-check-boss like patchwork) and was so proud of being in the top 10% parses :'')

Ive been married for 10 years i get sex weekly....duuuude find a new partner... wtf
---
Starting this on a Friday? Bold move cotton...
---
  Not really, especially by the time T2/PvP gear hits. Many people ask these PvP questions on Reddit about how to fight Warlocks and Shadow priests, but the truth is they are a hard match for absolutely everybody, and the most ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù OP 1v1 classes. Asking how to beat a Lock/SP 1v1 is like asking how to catch a Druid who wants to escape. On similar gear/skill levels, it‚Äôs simply close to impossible, unless the stars align and you get lucky timing/crits/ability procs.
---
You simply won‚Äôt kill a geared SPriest as a Hunter, unless you have a lot of room to kite in an open space and are able to engage from afar. Nor will you kill a geared lock, who, if he has T2 or better, can pretty much kill you with 3 dots and a couple instant abilities. Of course, you can always try to kite and let the pet do the rest, but it‚Äôs very situational. If there‚Äôs, be it, a pillar where you‚Äôre fighting, they‚Äôll just LoS you, kill the pet or use DoTs against you, and that‚Äôs it. BM is great against ungeared clothies - and still very good against them later on in progression if you have your Bestial Wrath CD up , but the amount of overall utility you gain in MM/Surv against other classes in PvP is just too good to be thrown out of the window for these two 1v1 monster classes, especially as it won‚Äôt grant you a kill anyway.
---
If you really want to kill locks and SPriests, your best bet would be to just make yourself a Shadow Resist Set and buy a couple Shadow Protection Potions. Else, you‚Äôll really be relying on RNG. These two are a hard counter to all the rest.
---
Yeah this meme is retarded but I guess it's not the last time we'll see it.
---
&gt; I am getting more and more worried about the difficulty in Classic. Many players left Retail wow because it was getting too easy and every change Blizzard is making to Classic is also making Classic easier.
---
Classic was always easy if your raid wasn't full of mouthbreathers.
---
Any top-1000 mythic raiding guild from retail would destroy classic content.
---
I mean it is possible to go atleast 15 days without food while consuming water so, hey blizzard better drop a announcement or they are technically promoting starvation :)
---
Im thinking of a non human rogue too on daggers
---
but maybe a gnome
---
I had druids beat me consistently 1v1 as shadow priest and I used to beat rogues consistently, even if they severely outgeared me. Druid has great potential, but comes with a high skill ceiling.
---
You're an idiot
---
That's not what even means
---
I thought they just reconfirmed "summer" so it could be the 21st of June.... ^maybe...
---
You should Google that
---
With human racial, BRE and slam spec Alliance can make 2h viable if you are having issues getting drops.
---
Really that many hours I thought i can do it if I played for5-6 hours everyday :D
---
The point you make regarding gear upgrades is true. People will get better gear and that gear will help guilds clear the next week faster. But what about when most of the raid already has more or less their best gear?
---
The 'current' speed-running record for any dungeon or raid is going to be broken VERY often in the beginning due to people constantly getting better gear, but that's not when it's fun to watch anyways so no worries! It's towards the end-game where speed-running becomes entertaining (at least for me). The obvious way to become faster is to gear up, but once that's not an option anymore people start exploring other tactics.
---
Can we avoid trash somehow? Is there another way to move through the instance? Can we pull more? Can we optimize our party/raid composition for this particular dungeon/raid? Etc. etc. There are plenty of ways to beat the record without simply getting better gear. :X
---
I agree; raiding BWL in 30 minutes isn't fun... but it's entertaining to watch a guild do it in 20 on YouTube.
---
Yeah like when the MT gets thunderfury and not the rogue.
---
Let's see, take extra dmg stance dancing or get fear ward...
---
We demand a 24/7 livestream!
---
technically, 3.0 was the wotlk prepatch, which would‚Äôve existed during tbc. but that‚Äôs neither here nor there because dual spec came out solidly in wotlk with 3.1
---
If you are fine swapping back and forth between nightfall and your primary weapon as well as using 150+ gold of consumables a raid night Ret can contribute to all but the most hardcore raids.
---
I remember back in Vanilla, there was a post on the French forums about how to prepare a 40 man raid to kill a Warlock like it was a world boss :D

I can deal with the other cons just fine

really? just because of curse immunity?

Let's see, being completely dependent on a skill from one race/class combo--or learning to play the game.
---
just go to the gym 3-5 days a week and put in effort while you're there 
---
you have one body for the rest of your life take care of it.
---
also don't neglect your work life / school life / progressing yourself in other ways.  again, you have one life take care of it
---
Yes, please.
---
the hero we deserve !
---
I'll co-sign that
---
I wouldn't mind a 30% buff to start, and maybe drop to 10-20% after that raid has been out for a year.
---
That is probably controversial, too, but I would like to see raids be challenging for hardcore players, while still allowing the "casualcore" players to get there . . . eventually.
---
Hunger strike has a more powerful ring to it than fasting. Water fasting is actually pretty healthy to do.
---
I'll see you in Azeroth! :)
---
Thanks. If I default on my loan, it‚Äôs on you now.
---
You arent getting enough damage out of the holy tree and you're shoehorning yourself into a stupid waradin build by taking literally none of the good stuff in Holy. You have to make saccrifices somewhere, and you cant afford a lot of the holy healing talents you picked up. 
---
At the end of the day, this is ret, if you dont minmax it, you're at a critical disadvantage. You're leveraging a lot of physical damage, but the physical coefficients aren't as good as the SP ones. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#svVz0xZZEf0xbcq this is the best hybrid DPS build for PvE. You're missing a lot of core pieces. This is the highest DPS varient that cant do the healing the hybrid build can, but gets something like 4% more dps. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#stVzZVhZEf0xbcq 
---
It's borderline impossible to fit in Healing Light and Spiritual focus without losing Imp SoR going for the SoC build, but the SoC build has dramatically worse PvE throughput. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sfyz0xZZVfotrcqo Here is a hybrid build that has PvP burst you want without losing anything that makes the new spellret good. SoC is pretty much always worse than a talented SoR, but judging it on a CCed target is still really incredible burst, so
---
Good Hunters are actually a rare breed, even today, believe it or not. If you want a spot in a good raiding guild you will get one as long as you play and act well. And casual guilds don't really have a choice, they just invite whoever is nice and online regularly.
---
But we will sing!
---
Ok well title says retail i guess we're both right lol
---
Addons bro.
---
Wait what? Are you saying the rogue should get it?
---
PvP can be awesome and frustrating day to day. For me it adds a new element to the game that makes it that more fun. 
---
But if you roll on PvP be sure to know when to stop trying. It's ok to log out as a ghost to an alt for a bit or love your leveling area some. 
---
I think most of the heartache from PvP comes when people are getting killed over and over because they are being stubborn. 
---
Just my 2 cents: have an alt and know when to use up some of his bonus come for those occasions where you're getting griefed.
---
considering  within a month of a raid release everyone ends up dressed the exact same  they probably will.
---
My prediction 12 months after launch once people figure out with BiS gear most classes look like a fucking idiot.
---
Easily. Wait times were more than an hour and you got in with your 400+ (minimum) ping lol.

---
I've gotta say, I'm with 'blakez19'; your message came off as quite agitated/irritated. :S
---
I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents and say that I don't believe most people see it as black and white as you make it out to be: "... reducing a rich, immersive fantasy RPG into a stupid numbers game". What's to say that speed-runners see the entire game as just numbers? I think it's much more likely that they do still see and experience the game as you describe it, but that they also simultaneously like to push their limits and test their abilities as a player, and as a team.
---
... also, some people are just more competitive than others. \^\^

Unless severely underweight, anybody can fast for 2 months.

---
Exactly, if all meeles are affected, it's going to be interesting how this is going to end out being in Blizzards Classic and until then, we can only wait. Thank you for ur input though, i was aware of the dmg not being 100% correct and i knew it affected everyone(to some degree, so in this term, every meele). I still gonna roll for Feral DPS though except.. Hemo Rogue actually being viable in MC already.
---
If u just said, the DMG is way higher than it should because of the armor, could u think of Hemo being viable(+210 DMG per Hemo, every 4 sec for 1 minute means +3150 DMG + starting out with 100 energy (2 hemos and nearly 3) it could Add up to +3780 dmg per minute)). Because i know That not only on classic, but also on p-servers, Hemo is absolutely insane with servo-arm(playing human because of the +5 mace skill) and anubisath warhammer in offhand. The DMG of the ability u do will also be Lower, but the debuff is not changing from 30x7 DMG per physical hit and therefore that could mean it's viable(in MC atleast as the DMG there is the lowest from all raids obviously because MC is the first raid) because in AQ40 it wasn't worth it for us, as the DMG increase from combat rogues were too high and the debuff doesn't change the value.
---
That's a horribly shallow argument.  Ease of completing a boss and minimizing damage taken by tanks is important.  It has nothing to do with learning to play the game, particularly when your average player of today could tank vanilla without issue.
---
Add electrolytes and you won't die.
---
There are a billion things you could hoard if you really want to.  Outside of stuff like cloth/ore/herbs look at raid consumables and pick just a couple to keep mats from.  Vendor the rest.
---
I‚Äôm also saving up all my cloth mats to send to an alt that I want to put tailoring on.. going herb/skinning for profit and then pick up engineering for pvp reasons after I get closer to my epic mount on my main which will be a Druid.. trying to get a mage up to 35 at least just to get tailoring started and hopefully use it for making bags for my main/alt/bank.. I would really like alchemy but I need to go engineering for pvp and I‚Äôm not sure how easy it would be to max on a lvl 35 alt since you have to go around the world to get artisan
---
I have been making a playlist in preparation over the last week. I'm still trying to fill it though!

Just saying, let the drama begin!
---
This is honestly a very awesome way to do it. The problem is that I've been playing too long to just read it and go... But if I hadn't played in a long time or was new this would be how I would tell people too.
---
My hunch is that a lot of the people posting here were hardcore raiders or PvPers back in the day.
---
For me, raiding was 90% of my classic WoW experience. I spent about 10 days /played levelling and another . . . whole lot . . . of days raiding. We don't talk about that number.
---
Hi, /u/Mazoki
---
You could kite him out of town using mind control.
---
Hemo was very viable.  I just don't remeber at what teir.  I am thinking it was BWL and ZG. Combat dagger and combat swords overtook in Naxx and AQ because the raw weapon scaling on those was just nuts with the AQ/Naxx weapons.
---
Feral IS viable in vanilla post BWL.  You just won't parse with a geared well played warrior.  IIRC you can totally keep up with rogues though.  It's a shit load of crowd pummlers, potions and world buffs but you can do it.
---
Then dont kill him?
---
you act like its hard? Im arguing you can do the entire game without fear ward--youre the one arguing its a near god damn necessity.
---
I can‚Äôt wait until memes are on the stock exchange

Lmao good gif will be stealing that

lmao

HYPE TRAIN WOOO WOOO

I'm gonna assume you have a lot of bodyfat to live off of

I played PvP, and will be playing PvE this time around because I find the vast majority of PvP to be straight up ganking with the sole purpose to piss you off and waste your time. Very rarely did I get these "gentleman's encounters" where its a fair skirmish that people so fondly remember.
---
[blizzard when they see people get a glimpse of hope for classic ](https://i.imgur.com/P2zNVuC.jpg)
---
BWL isn't being released until phase 3. I'm sure it'll be cleared within hours of when it's released, though. There will be a bunch of guilds will full MC/Ony gear by that point.
---
Beta potentially incoming.
---
I could easily make it to the end of the year doing this sadly.
---
Or summoning up the courage to use the search bar here this has been asked here before. The answer is always save everything.
---
Yo, tell me about that little terrarium bottle.
---
 We can talk about that until classic news.
---
If we don‚Äôt remember it why would we wanna watch a video of it
---
lmao, don't try to put words in my mouth.  Fear ward is obviously not a necessity.  My guild cleared AQ40 back in the day where half of us were using PvP specs.  So PvE specs weren't a necessity, but they sure would have helped us.
---
So when comparing what is best versus what is good, dwarf wins... unless you are stacked with dwarf priests in which case the argument for human spirit could make more sense.  Don't be so dense.
---
Tarja's Nightwish is best Nightwish &lt;3
---
For real tho, I complain about her not initiating, but she says I'm just bad at taking the hints.
---
Warriors are very desired, and very over populated. 
---
There should be 3+ tank spots and 5 (+/- 1) fury warriors. Your warriors are typically your biggest neckbeards. 
---
So yes, there are a lot of spots, but damn near 1/4 of the leveling playerbase will be warriors--certainly more than the 12.5% they should be--so just like rogues and mages you will have a lot of competition for your spot.
---
And yet i've seen a dps test where ret does 380 unbuffed in prebis. So ima go ahead and call that a shit player
---
Wow someone that says Hemo is viable, not finding these guys often. I'm amazed tbh.
---
Yeah, Hemo got overtaken with AQ already for sure. Maybe even with full T2 gear + weapons. But in Naxx when u got Servo-Arm Mace, Hemo not only did support the raid, but also u overtook the sword rogues again. For dagger rogues i'm not sure as we never really had one. But still, there is something broken about Hemo and servo arm that i did not discover yet, but it tried 1 months of AQ40 with Hemo, finding out to not be worth it(Naxx wasn't released at that time) and when i got servo arm i tried it out again for 1 month, finding out i'm topping the DPS Meter of the whole raid sometimes + u have to think about +3150-3780 DMG per minute. That was Quite insane for me but starting with molten core i don't wanna play a rogue if it isn't for the Hemo spec.
---
Stop cultivating and start harvesting!
---
CritChickens, or SpeedChickens.  For when they gave critical or haste depending on the expac.
---
You speak the truth, I will give paladin a shot.
---
If you want a guaranteed raid spot. Roll Warrior tank, priest, shaman, pally, or Druid heals. 
---
Or be the best goddamned hunter/mage/warlock/rogue you can be and get into a progression guild early. Learn your class well, and understand its full utility. Understand how your CC works, when to use it, how to apply it, how to save a 5 man, etc. 
---
I played shaman in vanilla and played it really unconventionally. But I understood the class really well and could utilize my army of totems situationally to impact and support whatever my group/party/raid was doing. 
---
In the end game I was all heals all the time. But all the time I spent soloing things I probably shouldn‚Äôt have on my way to 60 really taught me how to adapt to my situation. 
---
And by unconventional, I mean I tanked Undead Strath to completion on my enhancement shaman. Rock biter weapon + earthshock + earth bind or stone skin totem FTW.
---
Isn't this a bit of a loaded question since Vanilla didn't really have separate PvP and PvE routes?
---
You either had to R14 or otherwise PvE for your gear. So the vast majority of people are going to "PvE mostly to gear for PvP".
---
That was also when TBC was incoming. My guild had major problems motivating people to do Naxx runs when we all knew the loot would be invalidated pretty soon.
---
Nope.
---
RemindMe! 35 minutes
---
Bear in mind, pvp servers are more abrasive if there's a faction imbalance. When I joined in tbc I was alliance on a ~66% horde pvp server, which definitely contributed to my pve-bias.

He was probably already fasting anyway.

*Bad Hunters do more as BM in classic. Also most dungeons back in classic if you were a hunter in general and no one knew you doubt you were getting a invite. You can to prove to someone beforehand you could kite and chain trap.

I think it makes sense to start lower. Theres this GIANT flood of people trying to play on week 1, and 2.5-3k will already be *plenty*, even with sharding 1-10. I know they plan on a wave of tourists quitting, but they have a failsafe in case the subs increase after week 1 and 2, they can expand the realm size to 3k, 3.5k, or 4k. And after that, make more realms if that still doesn't meet the demand.
---
I remember on Shattered Hand a couple Horde guilds did this, but you bid for the item ahead of time and if it dropped, it was yours, if not you lost your money. It wasn't that popular because if you had the time to farm money, you might as well find a guild to raid with, but now with an older player base that may work.
---
Godspeed
---
Play them both.  I'll be swapping between three.
---
I agree...but medium being 2.5-3k and big being 4-4.5k. 10k is such a clusteruck IMO and could make the Classic community look bad as a whole.
---

I do regular 48-hour fasting every other week, it's really not a big deal, our bodies are equipped to deal with this. It's funny how hard this myth of "you have to eat every 3 hours your you'll ruin your metabolism!" has been hammered into people.
---
Holy shit I can‚Äôt believe I just almost read this autistic post in its entirety. If streamers getting attention annoys you then you need to get over the popularity issues you are still scarred by from school. 
---
If a streamer is annoying by advertising their stream in chat channels then ignore them and move on with your life.
---
Ah ah ah, poor Gorak ^^
---
Man, I start wondering if I am more happy when reading a new blue post or when checking your new videos...
---
&lt;reads latest post about character limit, knowing he can only afford 4-5 chars max (including bank alts!), 1 server and 1 faction&gt;
---
Ok I prefer your videos than the latest blues!
---
More please!
---
There is a thing such as a downtime community. 
---
When you couldn't get into the game in the past, forums would light up. People would discuss things. Wow Radio would be talking about it.
---
The state of everything being OK drives less activity. When things are problematic, we talk, we interact, we bitch, we socialize, things happen. 
---
So I disagree with you, it's not nostalgia madness, it's a world that comes more  alive whether it be for the good or the bad. It was a roller-coaster. Today things are very flat.
---
Mobs adapting to gear - flat.
---
No downtime - flat.
---
No service issues - flat.
---
Phasing making everything low competition - flat.
---
Flat is boring.
---
You can hop on a bus and take a 4 hour ride to the next town and do nothing but sit there for 4 hours. But if you had a barely holding together vehicle and crew of four that had to work the whole time to keep that bucket of bolts held together while you drove 4 (maybe 6) hours down the road to the next town while not stopping with your crew walking on the outside of your vehicle bolting shit back on, well I bet you would have a lot of stories to tell and exciting moments. See, it's not the nostalgia, its the ups and downs, its the roller-coaster, its the unexpected churning up of things.

In the average raid I will use: heal rank 2, greater heal rank 1, max rank heal, max rank greater heal, max rank flash heal, pw:s, max rank renew, prayer of healing rank 3, max rank prayer of healing. 
---
Other special cases would down ranking flash heal (if I want to be a meter whore), and using holy nova.
---
If you really want to simplify (not optimal, but ok): max rank flash heal. Max rank greater heal. Max rank heal. Max rank renew. Pw:s. Max rank prayer of healing.

There's actually a documentary on this exact "diet" plan on Netflix, and surprisingly, it's possible. Just maintain your electrolyte balance then you can probably last (unless you're underweight)

Can i get a #LINK# to this prophesy?
---
This is accurate except for the last one.  I remember watching my cousin play the game in beta.  Bought it on release.  Instantly made a character.  Didnt like it  took off a week before I decided what to roll
---
Sorry man 5 years is a long time. I agree that things like friendship are far more important. As long as they have a job, don't yell, aren't crazy, down with some hermitude, that covers 90% for me.
---
People here want to gloat and pretend the hand doesn't take 5 mins. Give me a break we play World of Warcraft ffs.
---
Perhaps trying to simulate original wow launch. xD
---
RIP in peace this man.
---
On my server, these were known as GDKP runs. I ran a lot of these in Wrath but never in vanilla. In theory, these work just fine as long as you have enough buyers to bid on the items and have enough patience to finish the raid. I had decent gear so I was "hired" as a "contractor" for other guilds that needed dps to make these runs. Typically, the raid would split all monies to every member. You could possibly reserve 5% which would work in a guild setting.    
---
With the advent of better communication software, I think people will have more access to these types of guilds that are capable of running these GDKP runs. You see it a lot on retail and I don't see why the same concept can't be applied to vanilla.
---
300 is like AFK levels of bad on a paladin. If the only thing he ever did was auto with SoC with very few consumes, yeah, that sounds fair, but that's a fucking stupid way to play the class. It's very, very easy to reach above 500 dps on ret if you're playing and building correctly.
---
I think people are confusing 1.12 with 2.0.1. Raids became much easier with the 41-point talent trees and the pre-TBC class tweaks.
---
I ran a 39 Twink guild on Eldre Thalas called Ten Ton Mantis. We had some really good players but never really did well in 10v10 premades, just didn't have a good balance of classes IMO or the right communication. Was a lot of fun though. Would love to remake my Hunter or warlock
---

OMG, the difference a green weapon and some Rumsey Rum Black Label makes.
---
That's a terrible system, why would anyone agree to that
---
100/100 fiber is inclusive in my rent that i pay here in my apartment in Sweden so no extra costs on that front wich is very nice.
---
For dps probably lock. But I disagree on the amount of hunters there will be. there will be far fewer than warriors rogues and mages for sure.
---
It entraps friendly targets too ??? Oo
---
I read somewhere some dude in Scotland who was insane big like 500+ LBS lost almost all of his body weight through vitamins and water for like 9 months, I myself am dieting and I am having a fuck of a time staying under 1700 calories like I feel like I'm starving to death all the time but i'm down 6 LBS in 1 month so it's working.
---
Link?
---
Wait... you can drink nothing but water for 15 days, even 2 months and not die? Or by "fast" do you mean reducing food intake.
---
It's just more dense.
---
I would think the bread and butter of mage farming is Dire Maul.  Dire Maul doesn't come out until Phase 2 so I would level the rogue first, then have the mage ready to go by phase 2.
---
I had to be about 8-10 years in before I found that as well.
---
Cool, thanks for the info :)
---
The hero we need, but not the hero we deserve.
---
Off topic, no,  but whilst levelling I plan on re watching all the old nostalgic childhood movies such as Lord of the rings, Harry Potter etc, all whilst levelling my character through my nostalgic journey, can‚Äôt wait
---
I played on a 10k private server on launch date, it was not playable at all. At the beginning it's amazing to see how many players there are but once you start *trying* to quest the real pain starts.
---
I bet a mage or warlock could do it without too much trouble at 10, if they have potions.
---
If you go through the top consumable list you can see white items in their material lists, save these items.
---
Save all white items needed to power level to engineering, as that will be done by 1000‚Äôs after they finish leveling
---
Save white items for enchants that glow, people eat that shit up
---
Save white items that are necessary for questing, the ah loves these
---
Not playing Blizzard games until we get an announcement
---
These are popular with PUGs since it lets you add people smoothly compared to LC/DKP/EPGP. It also encourages people who have out-geared a raid to join up and help out, since they won't have to spend any gold on gear so it's just flat profit.
---
The downside is that it's pretty biased to whoever can farm the most gold, and can definitely lead to tensions in a stable guild. But for PUG groups, it's one of the better systems IMO. No one feels like they didn't get anything, you either get gold, items, or some of both.
---
They are nice in world PVP because you can 1v1 a lot of classes and pick every fight. But yeah not the greatest by any means
---
I‚Äôm only going to eat DQ Blizzards until we get an announcement. Your move Blizzard
---
The frog that shows the pet happiness is not censored! DELET THIS!
---
#metoo
---
No it changes threat tables to only include units in melee range. So if your healer is standing next to them when it procs, suddenly they are the only unit on the threat table and it turns and murders them
---
Any server with the big streamers (eg: Asmongold, Spodapoppin, whatever hype-chasing variety streamer happens to be playing Classic for the weeks to months that it's relevant for them to until the next fad pulls them away to better viewership, etc) is going to be cancer. Massive laggy writhing masses of scrotum-swingers following them around, impossible to get world bosses or farm lucrative spots. Trolls and griefers trying to ruin the streamers time (any by extension everyone else's), etc. I'm definitely waiting to find out which server they're going to ruin and stay far, far away.

I had cable by 2004, but I do recall Mom booting me out of a few Star Craft 1 games. The transition from dial up to cable may have been the best technological leap in my lifetime.
---
I did this on a private server  in wrath but not with a guild. So you needed to link you had 60k at you, min bid per item was 10k 20 were well geared knowing tax 5 were weak but rich af. This was when there was still a gold cap of 213k ish.  The trinkets and weapons went for 150k to 2 goldcaps sometimes. This was done my mailing gold from alt. My best profit was once 82k. Becoming a lead was impossible, on horde side only 3 guys were accepted to make these raids.
---
you can heal dungeons as shadow spec up to 60 just fine so it's considered easiest to simply put all your points in shadow (and maybe get wand spec in disc) as you level, altho you could also put some points in holy or disc to improve healing if you think itd help there
---
Bobby Sands who?
---
Ye they should just add expansion progression servers to the realm list
---
Keep going my dude!
---
Yep! Used to run with 2 every week.  One for MC the other BWL.  It was great having the extra cash, I‚Äôve posted on here about it and people didn‚Äôt believe me when I said I would make upwards of about 500g a run.  It was great fun, would do again 8/8 m8!
---
\&gt;As long as they have a job, don't yell, aren't crazy, down with some hermitude...
---
There was definitely a lot of yelling by the end.  Long relationships like that very rarely end cleanly.  
---
I know I'll be happy in the future, when I find someone new who shows me love, but right now I don't have anyone, so I feel the hole a lot more.  
---
It's more annoying to me that she had found someone "new" within a month.
---
He¬¥s wrong. You can only transmog Legion legendaries, but old ones are still not transmoggable.
---
You're digging way too far into this imo, at the end of the day people are there to play the game, if they want to discuss on forums they can do so another time, if servers crash like hell it will just disgust the majority of players who just wants to be immerged into WoW, as shown with diablo 3 stability issues don't make any good to a game, like i said pure nostalgia madness.
---
Yeah, the human body holds onto calories in fat cells for a reason.
---
I prefer world PVP to battlegrounds, personally. Not only is the open world so much more massive and full of possibilities, but youre actually trying to do other stuff in that same world, too. It's not just capture the flag, or capture the base, etc. 
---
I think PVP makes the world feel more immersive, threatening. People may also a skewed idea of what it's like, since they probably were like me, and played on a 10k pop server. Vanilla should have 3-4k *max*. So it should still be easier to find a safe spot.
---
There is the occasional douche ganker who camps your gray-lvld ass for an hour. But that also gives the lvl 60s something to do when theyre bored, go defend their people.
---
I imagine TSM will be modified to work in Classic as well.
---
Doesn't the retail version of the game allow you to transmog the old vanilla gear?
---
So we could check to see if it looks alright or if it looks mismatched.
---
We must remain calm, if the last Alpha was internal there is no reason to think this first BETA wont be as well. Our time is coming.
---
Summer in the southern hemisphere doesnt start until december. So you're wrong.
---
depends on the prices. If you'd pay 500g to get an item for sure, it might be fair to only pay 100g for an item that has a 20% chance of dropping.
---
Literally what body fat is for, storing excess food for times when you may not have any.
---
eating no calories is actually easier than eating "low" amounts of calories, once you get past the first 50 hours. That being said it's only easier in the sense that you stop feeling hungry as often after 50 hours, you'll still miss the *taste* of food
---
It's the little things that I love, not the ~~server first~~  faction second (by a day!) rangaros kill, not tanking in MC, but just random encounters while levelling and out in the world.
---
My first 60 was a tauren druid, and while I healed for raids, I also farmed up a feral set in a duo with a rogue.  Some of my favorite memories are about sneaking into dungeons to duo bosses, like mother smoulderweb in LBRS and rattlegore in Scholo.  Not all bosses work for this, of course, but it was a lot of fun and very challengeing (considering we were looking for upgrades at the time).
---
Another time, I was farming with 2 guildies for the crusader enchant on the SE corner of EPL and a flagged rogue shows up (PvE server).  One of my guildies decided to attack the rogue, and immediately got instakilled by 4 rogues that popped out of stealth.  
---
I rerolled a rogue on a (conveniently timed) fresh PvP server during some guild drama, and have mained one since.  My most memorable experiences  are when I was nearing 60 and farming SM for greens to sell for some mount gold.  I ran across an alliance group going to SM at level, and had a really good fight against the lot of them, even with a 10 level gap!  I really miss being able to fight people of a different level without it automatically meaning the higher level player wins .
---
Lastly, I was in Tanaris as a fresh 60, on my way to silithus.  I noticed an alliance rogue, so decided to attack them.  Right before I'm about to finish him off, another rogue stunlocked me.  I noticed his dal rend sword (which vastly outgeared me at the time) and somehow managed to escape.
---
Is it the new spellpower build or classic waradin?
---
Countless adventurers where pummeled by Jade golems in that city.
---
Yeah a lot easier to get people on a public facing Discord "server" than it was to worry about sharing your Vent/TS server info.
---
repent !
---
Screw that, I want a in game mount of OP!
---
thats pretty dam stupid lol
---
I think you're looking at it from the wrong direction. Instead of having a server where streamers *cant* stream, which is impossible, choose a server you know the major streamers aren't going to play on. And if a small time streamer pops up, is it really that bad?
---
Well. One class is designed to do damage.
---
Three?! I wish I had that much time
---
You ok bro? You need to drop some aggro
---
First thing I saw too, feed your pet dammit!
---
It will be better that way. Pserver people try to brag about 10k server pops but really what is the difference between a 10k server and the connected-realm bullshit that exists in Retail?
---
We used to call it GDKP, was pretty popular on my old server during WotLK.
---
I know its a meme to shit on retail, but top level raiding actually still requires a shitload of time invested running content to essentially diablo-style gamble for better gear. 
---
Its not fun-spent time, but its definitely a *lot* of time.
---
You're conveniently forgetting the hurricane of rage that will follow any changes. No way they put focus targets in Classic if it wasn't in vanilla.
---
Well said. Additionally, and I may be the minority here, having to keep on your toes and stay away from higher level players so you don't get rocked is a major excitement that adds to the leveling experience for me.
---
I play in one of the top Pserver guilds. Our guild happens to have a Blizz employee in it. We are expecting major news today. That's all I'll say.

---
Good luck friend!
---
No what he means is the Epic PVP mount costs like 10G and the normal epic mounts cost 100G.
---
You'll have to farm 900G for the riding training either way though.
---
He's confused if he's implying that the normal mount costs 900G
---
Us gamers.
---
&gt; I have friends 
---
Uh huh.
---
Idk his speech is kind of annoying. "Perenolde is a total fuckboi" "Orgrim about to take a big W".  
---
   
---
Speak like a good damn regular person. Why can't more people just sound like madseason? As much as I appreciate lore, I cannot stand this guy, stopped halfway through
---
Cheaper? Classic is apart of the normal subscription fee, there's no additional purchase required to play Classic.
---
Okay, how is everyone feeling today? Good, Good. As many of you know I am Dizork and I will be your "Raid Leader" everyone I see is wearing the correct "Gear" of nylon jumpsuit and solid white tennis shoes, looking good guys. Now as you all know the Zeppelin to Orgimmar will be here at precisely midnight and under no circumstance should anyone drink their "Elixir of True Sight" prior to the Zeppelin arriving, it's a glorious day brothers... Were going home... one way or another, Lok'tar Ogar!
---
There's some new Paladin tech that I encourage you too look into. 
---
There's a new Spellpower ret build floating around that's proving to look like a pretty competitive dps spec. You use improved Seal of Righteousness instead of Seal of Command. Build looks like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#svVz0xZZEf0xbcq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#svVz0xZZEf0xbcq) Get melee hit and stack spell damage+healing. You get access to good healing and the best Paladin dps you can get in a single build. You can drop Imp Blessing of Might if you want more flex points for PvP. 
---
There's a lot of item and spell synergy that classic str stacking ret cant get. It maths out to be better than the str ret, and you can be a kickass healer at the same time in the same spec in the same gear.
---
Loot table plz?
---
No doubt!
---
Oh, they simply didn¬¥t handle it at all. 
---
Here is a nice comic about it: http://www.darklegacycomics.com/23
---
Nice post, but as a warlock how come the mages get PI?  I want PI, gimme gimme PI !!!
---
Seriously though, an alliance warlock would benefit from PI greatly.  Horde they might run into threat issues unless they have tranquil air, but lets be honest, what caster group ever gets tranquil air.
---
I've only done a 3 day fast but yeah I agree, I wasn't even hungry when I broke it, it was mostly just boredom and the fact that I went into the fast knowing I wanted to break it after 3 days
---
Yeah I'm not sure if it's worth going  rogue to play a better class. I've always played feral and dont know if I want to switch. There is always some fun with using a underpowered class though. I'm lost hahaha.
---
Oh I'm not in a hurry.
---
Let's do a simple calculation:
---
To level a mage it will take you 6-7 days of /played. Let it be 6 days.
---
6 days it's 6*24=144 hours.
---
I've heard that rogues can easily make 30+ gold/hour pickpocketing BRD or RFD but I'm sure there are even more lucrative methods of farming.
---
So, by most conservative estimates you could make 144*30 = 4320 gold in the period of time that would take You to level a mage to 60. 
---
I think that 4300 gold should be enough to last you for the entire duration of Classic. So why level a mage?
---
and with the SP build he can hit them pretty hard with NF too.
---
Be nice. This post is full of comedy and we owe it to OP!
---
So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance...
---
YES!!!!
---
Pre honor system during the Hillsbrad Zergs I would find other Rogues and we would coordinate attacks inside the South Shore Inn. Anyone sitting down to eat/drink after retreating from the battle would find one or more daggers critically inserted into their backside.
---
Oh OK got it thanks.

Please leave Gamon alone ! *intense cries*

---
They didn't say summer 2019...
---
Can confirm 20/0/31 or 21/0/30 going for a melee spellpower build is very legit. It covers all your bases in PvP for burst, and offers the best Paladin PvE dps that's theoretically possible rn. Here's my pet spec. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sfyz0xZZVfotrcqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sfyz0xZZVfotrcqo)
---
fuck i almost choked on my coffee
---
Steve Irwin funeral
---
Yeah, I arguably should go eng rather than alch, but eng seems like a lot of work and a bit of a money hole. Definitely fun though, my best friend went eng back in vanilla and really enjoyed it.
---
I really can't help you because i'm an mmo hoarder. You know, these people keeping everything of potential value for 50 levels or more. Bank space is so small! :(
---
Very little. You're completely anonymous and you can behave however the fuck you want, there are no repercussions for bad behavior because the community is way too large to self police.
---
It definitely adds a sense of danger. That dread you get when you round a corner and see another player with a skull for a level mining a node or something and just say "oh shit" is a fun time.
---
Login queues. People would disconnect during a raid and get stuck in an hour-long queue before they could rejoin.
---
Patch days got pretty bad, too. General server instability plus long queues, and when you finally got in, there was a good chance of the server going down and you'd have to wait through the queue again.
---
GMs would send a red serverwide message "SERVER GOING DOWN IN 5 MINUTES". Everyone would log out, and then all of the people waiting in queue for the last hour would finally log in . . . only to see the red message, and get booted and stuck back in queue with everyone else again.
---
Our server started the AQ opening event at like 5am on a Wednesday to avoid server issues.
---
&gt;This makes me wonder if this type of system could work for an actual raiding guild, once a raid is on farm status...
---
as it is on retail currently, sellrun spam will dominate all chats
---
I've personally never heard of a guild using GDKP as the primary loot distribution system during progression; I've only ever seen it used for semi-PUGs for farm content.  I certainly would not recommend it for progression, or even for guild-only farm runs.
---
Yeah. You also have the benefit of not playing the same class as everyone else and you level significantly faster.
---
I'm not high-end lvl expert but I always focussed on pvp and I ate my portion of dots during classic years ago so ... ... ... 
---
- Yes it is very hard match up (like for everyone :P ) 
---
- but there is Shadow resist potion and it is cheaper than potion of lesser invulnerability (so it's easier to use it in every day pvp)
---
- and there is Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector ... which not only negates dmg or fear against you but also deals this dmg to Warlock / SPriest 
---
- also there are other stun items in engineering and yes they also can use them but there is no Hunter's dmg reflector and if someone knows how to use this advantage it is big 
---
- However if we talk about wPvP really alot depends on who attacks who ... if hunter was attacked than we should treat it as first mistake ... we have tracking and it is a WEAPON ... AMAZING WEAPON ... use it 
---
- Keep also in mind that if we are attacked (wPvP) without us knowing it our goal is ... escape ... heal ... track back ... re-engage ... I know it's hard because of amount of dot damage but it is doable ... 
---
- About battlegrounds keep in mind this is team fight and if you are fighting 1 on 1 against someone who shouldn't jump on you it is error number 1 and as such it should be treated 
---
- To sum it up ... we have tracking and kiting tools ... don't let enemies jump on you and if they do ... escape and re-engage ... duels are for ***** ... fight to kill ... whoever stands last ... wins ...  
---
Good luck everyone!! 
---
Cheers :)
---
Classes have specific items they‚Äôll find useful in the form of reagents. Rogues-Swiftthistle/fadeleaf.  Mages/priests-light feather. Warrior-large fang. Shamans-fish oil. So, depending on your class you can narrow your research. 
---
More specific items you should pick up for your guild‚Äôs progression...Larval acid and scroll of protection IV come to mind.
---
I don't know what you're doing, but about 1.5 years ago I did a low-carb diet for 4 months, lost 45 pounds (half has come back already). It was pretty easy to keep to, compared to other diets.
---
All valid
---
Is it OK to pick his pocket?
---
Why do you need a farming alt when you have a rogue that is a competent farmer ?
---
That only makes sense if we ignore the very real possibility of a lot of tourists trying out the game and leaving rapidly again.    
---
Thankfully Blizz is aware of that and allready stated there wont be a lot of realsm at the begin
---
That guys hunger strike WORKED!!!
---
Yup üòÑ
---
Everyone looks like a skittle in Classic unless you have a full tier set lmao
---
Yeah it's a terrible system for progression, it's definitely meant for split raids, PUGs, and farm content.
---
He‚Äôs wiping. HES WIPING HIS ASS
---
I remember this being a thing on my server during TBC, but the main guild that did it would only take like 2 guys that were different classes and they each got everything that dropped for their class. I never inquired as to the price, I had heard it was like 10k for a Hyjal/BT night but that seemed low to me.
---
Fully agree. It honestly doesn‚Äôt make any sense to level an alt purely for making gold. You can use your main, even a slow one to makes thousands of gold in that time. On top of that, playing the economy is a way better money maker.
---
Yes they did.
---
She's Fuggo, face is like a tumor that learned to talk.
---
Probably the hardest quest to complete in WOW, he is always dead when you need to kill him ! :D
---
Tinfoil hat, this is evidence of nothing. Blizzard specifically said that the elements for these pieces of UI still existed in the game while it's being developed and not to panic about it. We haven't even gotten the beta yet, calm down.
---
True that, you think I could find a group to raid with that would let me dps and offtank? I dont enjoy healing all that much
---
ud shadow priest
---
You personally won't kill him because he will constantly be dead.
---
The game already has seen a few changes but Blizz has proven they're committed to doing this right regardless of the inevitable rage (nobody agrees on everything).
---
I think you need to clean your bong
---
I didn't heal in vanilla despite my love of the class. Can I ask how to weigh stat priority?  Is +healing always preferred or is there a limit to how much int or spirit I should be willing to sacrifice for +healing?
---
lol even without classicc I never do any exercice
---
"It's simple Supply and Command!"
---
There are not a lot of gold sinks in Vanilla, so eventually there will be a lot of gold in the economy and you'll see stuff like this more commonly. It won't be for a while though, because the raiders want to get their gear first before selling it, and then there needs to be enough gold in the system to make it worth the raiders' time.
---
It will probably be around the middle of Phase 3, after BWL is released, that selling raids really takes off. Good raiding guilds will be getting gear from BWL and so they will be able to easily clear MC while carrying 10+ customers.
---
Not hard and people love you
---
Fake news
---
I'm gonna do the same thing but with cheesesteaks.
---
Good luck friend
---
There is a quest to kill him?
---
When I played vanilla I was disc/holy for everything through about 1/2 of Naxx and then shadow nolifer for a few expansions after that.  I'm going to play casual this time around with my son (lock or war) but I have a concern.  The goal is to help him see all of the dungeons and 20 mans then PvP after we've got any upgrades we can from them.
---
On PS, is it possible to run a single shadow spec / hybrid smite build and not be so completely worthless you can't gimp heal or dps dungeons through 20 mans if needed?
---
I'm sure the appropriate response is, git gud and farm respec costs with an alt or professions.
---
The talents you get from the deeper MM tree scale better with your gear but actually need to aquire said gear first to get past the damage of a BM spec. A fresh 60 hunter in blues just does more in BM spec. People usually don't do that because of Trueshot though.
---
My guild ran GDKP runs for a while in Wrath too. I think it's a model that could work really well in Classic, especially later into its lifecycle.
---

Don't fail!
---
I don't care one way or another if Tokens are in Classic. They are a zero-sum exchange, and only served as a benefit by largely ruining the business of chinese gold sellers. I'd rather have Tokens than gold sellers botting up the server, stealing accounts, spamming, etc.
---
Why does it come out in phase 2 if it‚Äôs just a 5 man?
---
There will be too many rogues regardless of faction
---
&gt;shrimp bubble
---
Googles shrimp bubble, proceeds to purchase one.    Thanks OP
---
Awesome didn't know about that thanks
---
Darkmoon Fairie items can be worth holding until the event releases. They are:
---
Evil Bat Eye
---
Glowing Scorpid Blood
---
Vibrant Plume
---
Soft Bushy Tail
---
Torn Bear Pelt
---
Small Furry Paw
---
First two are the most valuable, as they are the max rep items and can be turned in any number of times.
---
I didn't know they were
---
They also worded it in a way that we could just have a beta all summer.
---
I hope they remember you
---
I'm in the same boat. Since shortly after the announcement, I've been pretty fixed on going Holy pally main. Something about their efficiency and those short fast Flash of Light heals seems appealing. 
---
But the toolkit priests have, as well as the class fantasy of being a cloth wearing cloth class, instead of being a cloth wearing plate class &gt;.&gt; Perhaps I'll make a priest alt too and duo level it with somebody.
---
It's too late to go on a crash diet, friend.
---
Alliance side you have 0 competition for gear. VERY rarely will you get another hunter in a dungeon group, you MIGHT have one other in UBRS, but doubtful since people didn't really like bringing more than one. Also with low hunter representation in raids it's super easy to gear up in them.
---
I have no idea what it would be like as Horde with shamans though. I would assume hunter gear would make good enhancement gear.
---
Thanks! I'm hoping to get back to my bootcamp weight before Classic drops because I will be sitting A LOT when it does!
---
Level 1 gnome runs to Org!
---
Well at least one person understands this!
---
You're assuming OP gets ridden?
---
I jumped straight down from 3000+ a day to 1000 maximum. It took one week for my stomach to shrink, but I'm doing ok now on my 3rd week. The hunger sets in and I just drink some more water, or snack on grapes or something.
---
Keep pushing! It's working for you, and that's what matters most.
---
Shit's going down..
---
i gotta love how they butchered the town in hearthstone by turning it into another kezan, just because the name gadgetzan was more marketable
---
Right, I'm sure they're not *planning* on expanding any numbers. But I'm saying it is a failsafe *in case* there is sub growth past the first 2 weeks. Which, even though it's not what Blizz is predicting, I think will be the case. I predict a massive launch, a slight immediate dip, and then a very small steady rise until it plateaus a year or so later.
---
even then DW is not recommended until you have a good naxx 1h, and its sub-optimal in BGS anyway
---
I like your positive attitude, have a great day. :)
---
I was with you when I first read this post earlier. But I‚Äôve failed just over three hours later.  I‚Äôll see if I can make it longer before I eat dinner.  I‚Äôm with you in spirit
---
random but, how long have you had your shrimp ecosystem? i was thinking of getting/making one for my desk
---
There's already people working on addons for Classic (I've seen screenshots of an Interface skin addon from BFA ported and running in the Classic client via emulated server), and since the client will by closely resembling the modern BFA addon API, the difficulty in porting most addons from BFA to Classic won't be all that bad. Unless the addon in question requires a significant portion of inter-addon communication which Blizzard has said they're looking to tamp down on to prevent user-made LFD tools from ruining the social fabric of the game.
---
I wouldn't want the servers to be an unstable mess at launch, but I could see the humor in it if that happened.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/how-many-characters-can-we-create-in-classic/163599/23

Does this count? haha
---
Ya I remember as a pvper I looked into it.    A guild wanted 2000g for bloodfang shoulders.   I just stuck with my r10 stuff.   2000g was something a vanilla pvper wont have lying around.
---
idk what happened, but in the last few weeks this sub has started devouring itself.  
---
people giving a 'google it' response to questions, yet shitting on any class guide that gets posted.
---
people shitting on anyone that posts a video discussing a blue post, while there is literally nothing else to discuss
---
someone asks about best dps, half the responses decrying min/maxers, as if it wasnt a thing in vanilla
---
this sub has become ornery, and showing the true nature of Vanilla players. we werent any better than the retail crowd. we were just as  bad and probably worse in some regards.
---
Hey dude, I think you already know it but you‚Äôre doing good and on the right path. I am also off of a once meaningful long term, and it wasn‚Äôt great by the end either. Take away all of the fun times you had, put them in a memory vault to look at every now and again and call it a day. Being single can sometimes be unfortunate due to lack of closeness, but it also has a nice amount of freedoms. You wanna play Classic all night, and then sleep until noon? Your decision. You actually want to get Popeyes instead of what you had planned for dinner? All good. You want to splurge and get a nice pair of shoes? You can spoil yourself because that‚Äôs who your best friend is right now. Get to know yourself and even ‚Äúdate‚Äù yourself. It‚Äôs very freeing to feel self sufficient, and in time you‚Äôll feel prepared if somebody catches your attention, but it won‚Äôt feel like a necessity. I hope the best for you my dude!
---
It was pretty short lived and all I remember about it was the Nef claw was BiS mainhand for hemorrhage.
---
I raided all Vanilla as a Warlock so melee itemization is fuzzy at best for me.
---
loved the asmongollum
---
I‚Äôll hop into this conversation. I agree Kara was just outstanding. Was when my experience with raiding actually took off and I got a taste of what endgame was. For me, Ulduar was the pinnacle. That was my first taste of raiding with a top guild on our server and being in a competitive raiding environment. Between Kara and Ulduar, nothing has come close
---
I tried a bit with full t2, t2.5 and corrupted ashbringer on a Pserver.  Vengeance procs were nice but the burst and SOC crits were pretty great too but it didn't have the raw burst potential of reck bombs- but much better sustained DPS especially in PVE settings where you aren't being attacked. 
---
Very fun PVP spec too though, with any of the t2, t2.5 gear and the Flash of light libram you can be an extremely effective PVP healer and dish out some punishment too. 
---
Do you primarily use SOC or SOR?  I see you buffed SOR 5/5 but still have soc, assuming you maybe use SOR in PVE and SOC in PVP?
---

---
Once the Beta arrives for Classic, Addon developers will get their chance to start working on their code in preparation for release. Which will all but guarantee a plethora of addons to be available at launch. Just like every WoW expansion thus far where the UI API sees the most significant changes.
---
Jesus, break up dude. Either she's getting it somewhere else or she has a medical condition.
---
I will not be using a questing addon for at least my first character. Having to read to find where things are made leveling much more engaging.
---
But yeah, just limit yourself if you don‚Äôt like it. I won‚Äôt be using a questing addon but I will be using something like DBM for raiding.
---
I've cut all Soda from my diet. Only water, coffee and green tea with no sugar and I was drinking maybe 2-3 sodas  a day. I've started counting calories and so i'm really in love with raw veggies and greek yogurt ranch dip, avacados twice a week because they are about 340 calories alone but i need to bring my good cholesterol numbers up so sparingly but I try like hell to stay away from carbs. I've also taken up walking my security checks instead of taking the golf cart and I went from 1200 steps a day to 9000+ and i'm trying to do sit ups and crunches as well.            
---
         
---
I also ordered Whey Protein to drink for breakfast because I hear high protein helps burn fat and make you feel full so i'm hoping that will really help me.
---
The worst moments for me on a PVP server was accessing MC or BWL / waiting for other people to join and die / corpse run 10 times before entering the actual raid instance.
---
Organisation with 40 people was already not easy, wasting time with useless PVP was not fun for me!
---
My understanding is that they reconfirmed summer AND stated "Second half of the year".
---
Truth. The longest documented case of fasting was something like 500 days for a guy that was incredibly obese. Granted it was medically supervised and supplemented with minerals/nutrients but... he might just make it
---
He did but had cardiac issues going forward, even with medical supervision.
---
It will trivialize/obsolete MC since it has generally better itemization
---
This can only mean one thing...invasion
---
&gt; at the end of the day people are here to play the game
---
This is why I think you are wrong. 
---
At the end of the day, people are here to EXPERIENCE the game and part of the vanilla experience was all the BS small things. From having to loot each mob, to mailing 1 item at a time. You cant even shift click a mailbox item and have it auto move to your bags.
---
Waiting to get into the game told you something, it was feed back, it told you this game is popular, people want this, people are waiting in line to do this. then you finally get in and youre like "hell yeah!" And now you feel your time should be spent wisely. What might have been a meh, I think I'll go do dishes right now, or some laundry turns into, "hell nah, that shit can wait for later" I waited an hour to get in and I'm going to play the shit out of this. you log in and you see in chat "FINALLY I GOT IN!" And youre like "shit man, same here, just got in and waited for an hour" and people talk, shit happens. The system churns. 
---
you know what happens on BFA when I log in..
---
I log in. . . . that's it.
---
It's not madness, it's what being alive looks like. It's that exciting ride down the road where things are barely holding together.
---
I need a release window as well. I have to put my time off from work months in advance. If they just do a 'suprise' it's next week.. im fucked.
---
The difference between ‚Äúdisc‚Äù and ‚Äúholy‚Äù specs is like literally 6 talent points.
---
Y no RP?
---
Okay okay okay......July 2nd...
---
This is more a hybrid PvE/PvP build and i would fiddle it a bit if I wanted focus either way. I use SoR unless I can get a CCed Judgment of Command. In PvP I usually run a slow weapon and play for burst damage with SoC, but in PvP I usually use SoR. Crowd Pummelers are fantastic, but take effort to farm. You can get away without them, but it's not nearly as good.
---
We need 1 RP-PVP server for NA and 1 for EU.
---
*laughs in xxpenorboi*
---
I‚Äôm 120 pounds and 5.7 fuck off with that wow community bullshit
---
Ah so it‚Äôs basically a catch up mechanic ?
---
i will boost a lowbie in Stockades/RFC when classic comes to pay for my ignorance
---
Warrior, for the last time warrior
---
Well I know they plan to have RP-PVE. I hope those that want it get a RP-PVP server.
---
But I'm healthy besides the diabetes??!
---
I just really like rogues, and to a lesser extent hunters in vanilla. They have so many little RPG elements like poisons, pet management, ammunition, etc. I always found that really fun.
---
You should try what I do. No exercise no video games. Been at it 3 weeks. I run everyday before work and do push ups and sit-ups and squats. If I don‚Äôt finish the workout I don‚Äôt play games. And I love me some games.
---
I plan on mostly pvp with some pve and the utility it brings is a must for serious pvp
---
Except shaman lol
---
True.
---
But I'm guessing OP was thinking about MC and Ony IMO.
---
Locking everything passed kalimdor and EK with 60 as level cap does not make classic lmao
---
One less fucker in STV
---
they can sell many things aside from just gold...
---
I just never understood why people went to such length to try and make ret work. Just to be equivalent to an AVERAGE dps you have to invest so much extra time and effort. I know that's attractive to some people....but not me lol. I'd rather invest that time trying to be #1 than just be  average.
---
Utterly cancerous. If you can envision yourself in a dog-eat-dog environment where people will go out of their way to kill you for sport,  whilst simultaneously holding you back from getting questing/gathering done. If that sounds like what you're into, then roll PvP.
---
Otherwise, put your feet up, grab a can of your favorite beverage and roll PvE.
---
'The reality is - 40 man raids are desperate and will take anyone who can play at the time '...
---
will probably never get halfway through MC, will get a couple of bosses in ZG or AQ20 because the attendance starts dropping to where they are lucky to get 20 people to show up....and the guild will disintegrate shortly after the first time 12 people show up on a raid night.
---
Rule of threes is a pretty good guide.
---
3 minutes without oxygen
---
3 days without water
---
3 weeks without food
---
&gt; Enhance is usually a nightfall bot (sadly) for serious raids.
---
For serious raids enhance won't even be brought. Warriors will be the nightfall bots
---
I mean from a functional standpoint the servers would be the same - you aren't wrong there. This isn't a regular "update" or "rollback", they are handling a completely unpredictable beast, it would be wise to make sure the new bridge that was just built holds your weight \*even though\* the same builders used the same material to erect it.
---
yes! i remember my first time coming into stonetalon mountains, i didn't know where i was going and just followed the road while inspecting anything that caught my eye. i found a little hill with a cave, and another player there. intrigued, i went further in... only to catch sight of a skull level enemy. 
---
distinctly remember hiding in the back of the cave behind some rocks and watching as a single frostbolt flew in and decimated my newfound companion. waited a bit and snuck out of the cave without dying. it was such a fun experience tbh.
---
Dartol's Rod of Transformation. Turns you into a furbolg, it only requires a short quest, and it's Alliance only. Only drawback is that it breaks on damage received and you can't mount with it. Only a 1 minute cooldown too.
---
It has its place in game but it just wasn't how paladin was designed.
---
##QUICK, SOMEONE CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT!
---
Well, unsticking without new sticky post is kind of m√§h
---
Possible, although I still think the most likely single release date is July 16.
---
Let's hear more about this shrimp bubble. What kind of maintenance do they need?
---
You gonna die bro. It's an honorable death tho. You will be mourned.
---
Haha yeah, I did gnome runs and Lv1 Hogger raids a couple times.  Had to make characters on a different server because we were Horde PvP so we'd invade some random PvE server enmass with gnomes and humans and the poor lads never saw us coming.  Lol
---
Bruh, just take that shit lol.  Or dump her.
---
To remember
---
we had a elemental in guild when we where raiding in vanilla he was normally a healer. But sometimes we told him that he can do damage, because we did not need his heals on that particular fight.
---
If you plan on playing a PvP server. My suggestion is to do it before people get a main to comp and rolfstomp your ass for killing their alt once
---
Need to have sex for that to be necessary.
---
Not really just gold, leveling services, stolen accounts, ninja looted ench materials.
---
Nice try. That's clearly a glass of Powerade. It says right there.
---
Dude is going to die. We will petition for Blizzard to add an NPC for the guy next to a ‚ÄúBobby Sands‚Äù NPC both next to glasses of water. They will add them. 
---
And then the NoChanges people will boycott the game and it will flop and be shut down before AQ drops. 
---
Guy doomed the entire game and died to do it. 
---
F.
---
Yeah I know of that but the no mounting really sucks for it haha. Thanks
---
I think phase one , could be wrong tho
---
Stack that MP5 and frost shawk + puppeh + purge all day.
---
You smoke dope you ain‚Äôt gonna make it them munchie gonna hit you day 2 and your gonna be like I was just kidding blizz please give me that release date.
---
You can most likely raid as 30-0-21, it's not awful.
---
As for gear. There is some shared items for sure. A lot of the tier gear is great for elemental and resto. It's gonna be a bit different though, you don't want squishy high +heal cloth gear as elemental, you want mail with some stam, int and preferably spellpower instead of healing.
---
Where's your hand of reckoning?
---
Patch 1.4, thus phase 2.
---
He's talking about disc/shadow vs disc/holy though, which is quite different.
---
xxlegolassxx
---
It's really never worth it to level an alt just for making gold. You need that alt to have some sort of important second objective.
---
This is actually genius! Can be applied to so many different things.
---
Ohhh boy. We got a live one boys!
---
Yup, it's why he is targetable in the first place, not for releasing steam \^\^
---
Phase 2
---
Boi don't do this
---
&gt;Bruh, just take that shit lol
---
As in on her chest?? Ok will try.
---
I just read some lore thay he fucked slmething up abd he is targetable. But that there is a quest is mindblowing to me.
---
they wrote a line of code today. that is all.
---
Take out that comma
---
&gt; like I feel like I'm starving to death all the time
---
You are, just slowly. Thankfully you can stop starving when you need to, so no real risk. But that's why it's so fucking tough, you are literally starving. Good job and keep it up though :)
---
RYE TOE
---
For me it's really ALL - I have a 120 shammy in retail üòÑ
---
I searched net for myself before posting here and I got mixed info ... I got info like this:
---
‚Äê-----------------------
---
Patch changes
---
Patch 1.8.0¬†(patch date:2005-10-10):¬†The ability to transform Rhok'delar and Lok'delar has been removed.¬†
---
Patch 1.4.0¬†(patch date:2005-05-05):¬†Added.¬†
---
But elsewhere I got info about patch 1.6 ... and stats update 1.12 ... and I don't know which info (if any) is correct
---
See I just told my guild I was combat daggers, and kept up with the actual combat rogues on meters cuz I min maxed more than them on cooldowns and consumes. No one ever knew
---
Tbh bubble is very mana inefficient and not super powerful even with improved PW:S. It's a great situational spell though for certain oh-shit moments. You'll almost never be bubbling the tank at the beginning of a pull regardless of class anyway
---
So you're an outlier?
---
Great!  I'm your height but weigh in the 170's, I should be in the 160's, working on that myself.
---
I honestly hope the launch isn't till September so I can enjoy the summer without having to split priorities ;)
---
lol@the host website. gl
---
I‚Äôve heard that SP is still a viable healer in dungeons. I‚Äôm just curious if that means that they can get the job done or if they might need to respect slightly to become viable.
---
they are good. they are powerful.  especially rogues and warriors that got big buffs when their talents were reworked at the end of the cycle.
---
I'll be playing after a whole day of work and after the kids are asleep so I need a game to enjoy and relax. It will PvE for sure (again like in classic). Last time I tried a PvP server was on Nost where my level 20ish Lock got killed by a lvl 60 Rogue countless times. Yeah... That was really "fun" . 
---
I like PvP, but I like to keep it fair (at least to some degree) so I'll fight mostly in WSG, AB and AV. And not in open PvP aka 80 people are running around for hours in XR or TM, accomplishing nothing but breaking the server.
---
Trying to remember but my memory is shit.
---
In 1.12 enh shammys dual wielded Ironfoe + X with 2 different WF ranks right since they didn't share ICD?
---
tanaris was an amazing questing zone. Going from a desert to basically hawaii with pirates.
---
I'm pretty quickly approaching the point of swearing off consoles altogether, to be honest. I bought an XB1X to play games with my buddy because Microsoft and Sony apparently decided this was going to be the generation to kill local co-op. I've since gone through... maybe a dozen titles with him I felt were worth the effort. And half of those were last-gen remasters.
---
I grew up and fell in love with campaign-focused co-op. Dynasty Warriors, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, Gears of War, Saints Row, Diablo, etc. Half the games I used to love simply don't exist anymore, most of the other half have been turned into unstructured online team-fests.
---
I barely do any gaming these days, but it's not for lack of interest. That's why I'm so excited about Classic.
---
Probably not intended as one when it released, but yeah it pretty much is.
---
&gt;Helping question: what is your plan on bow upgrades during leveling and at lvl 60? ... pvp oriented :P
---
The really important ones are getting the verdant keeper's bow from the DM quest reward, and then getting a blackcrow from LBRS as soon as you can, as this is going to be your weapon for all of phase 1 (and indeed, all of phase 2 until rhok'delar). The alternatives - carapice spine crossbow and bloodseeker will not be in phase 1.
---
5/3/2019 ~ 4:02 pm EST
---
I, me, hereby solemnly swear to only drink water (and the couple of arnold palmers in my fridge) until we get a release date for World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
You don‚Äôt have to kill yourself but if you move around for 30 mins and set that as a barrier to you playing games then vidya feels like a reward. I‚Äôm doing okay with it, I hope I can keep it up.
---
Inb4 Blizz secretly starts to worry and sends OP immediate access to Beta but under NDA.
---
-&gt; This spirals into a snowball effect of people desperately going on hunger strikes and getting beta access from Blizzard
---
-&gt; Over 2 million people lose immense amounts of weight over thhe next 2 weeks.
---
-&gt; Blizzard is not reorienting at developing fasting supplements and guides.
---
-&gt; Shortly before WoW Classic launch, half the World has gone under the minimum BMI, resulting into 90% less food bought and consumed.
---
-&gt; World Hunger cured.
---
We broke up 6 months ago.
---
BM is extremely strong early game PvP, but becomes less effective the better people‚Äôs gear becomes. This is due to the fact your pet doesn‚Äôt improve at all when you get better gear. So as everyone else gets stronger your pet just stays the same strength. Overall my favorite hunter PvP spec is 21/21/9 in order to get the stun and scatter shot.
---
nope gonna have ingame music on.
---
I can't really comment on druid vs shadowpriest to be honest, our 2 main shadowpriests I had in my guild (they went shadow for naxx) didn't pvp sadly. And I couldn't find a serious shadowpriest as most just.... fell over against me.
---
Mindflay doesn't do much as we shift and it usually canceled the cast. Silence, while it can stop healing, rejuve first and casting heals early can negate a lot of this power.
---
Even with double dots, you can heal through the damage.
---
Beyond that, you are just worried about PW:S, and their own self healing but usually you are able to outlast their mana pool.
---
And SPriest vs Rogues, does it come down to the priest able to outlast the stunlock, heal up then able to dot them to death basically? I am curious as I haven't really seen much out of shadowpriests in Vanilla.
---
Cheers!
---
Really not my problem, stay the fuck off my jobs pathetic slave
---
The maces that come out of AQ, mainly the trash drop(s), are the best one handers for warriors that aren't orcs to get ahold of. Most of the rogues grab up or get first shot at the swords in BWL/AQ if they aren't dagger.
---
I tend to see a lot more people pick tauren if they don't play an orc as a warrior. Same thing applies though for undead or troll. Just don't see a whole lot of troll/undead warriors.
---
*They wrote in wow tokens in response to this.
---
Have you considered playing older games? There's a whole world of amazing titles from yesteryear.
---
Last summer I didnt play games if I didnt walk or run to the top of a nearby mountain (takes 30min up and down). Worked for a while, since it didnt take ages to do the "chore".
---
There's 9 days of Summer in June. Apparently some people thought that before this little report, June was still possible. So people thought in May, we'd get a release date in June.
---
You armchair psychologists can sit here and try to tell me I'm trying to sound cool, bold, or manly - you can shove all that up your ass. I'm just expressing a feeling I had about people's desperation.

Carebear

Woah woah woah Hunger strike is what we do while playing friend :)
---
no time to goof off when there's so much content to consume and leveling being actually fun.
---
Er not getting lightwell is a bit of a straw man, nobody is getting that anyway
---
How to name your character.
---
Use words like Sin, Dark, Death, (think emo) or alternatively anything from lord of the rings. Just remember to add random Xs in the name so you can be extra cool!
---
If he is a warrior tanking the 5 man's you'd  be able have control of the group composition to make it optimal.
---
Fucking loved that spell
---
Thank you. 
---
I think watching Endgame by my self was what brought me round.  I was dreading going alone but afterwards was practically skipping home.  Its slow going but I see the other end of the tunnel. 
---
I plan on staying single for a couple more months before I find anyone else, I haven't been single for 10 years now, so it's new for me.
---
Please do not confuse RP servers with Moonguard, thats like saying to stay the hell away from comic cons because you went to a furry convention.
---
Yes they're not the best but they're miles ahead a prot warrior or a holy priest.
---
You can do BRD pick-pocketing runs, Dire Maul jump runs (need a healer) or just farm mobs as combat spec.
---
It could be a problem if you only use daggers with a PVP build though, sword or maces are much better for farming.
---
i was looking for the "depends on which character I am in the mood to play that day" option.
---
This is precisely what I was looking for. Thank you for the in-depth response. I keep seeing a disc/shadow healing spec brought up. Is it safe to assume that is only a niche raiding spec for later content?
---
PvP servers aren't really that bad.  Sometimes you get ganked but after BGs introduced it isn't like a huge thing.  
---
There is a pretty big difference in consumables and whatnot.  Engineering is wayyyyy more popular in PvP servers.
---
If my memory is correct, a "normal" person does ok for roughly a week, maybe two, before running into significant nutritional issues (lack of vitamins, minerals, etc.). But we can *survive* for a month or more without any food.
---
This build was from two days ago according to the timestamp.
---
I'd play on an RP server just to avoid all the dumb ass memesters naming their characters after Trump.
---
I got no virus from it! As far as I can tell lol
---
Regarding Enhancement Shamans, I think there are a few things that really need to be noted. This is my personal opinion as someone who raided as an extremely well-geared Enhancement Shaman through most of Nax in Vanilla, but YMMV.
---
Quite frankly, Enhancement doesn't even make it to middle of the pack, even with BIS gear, let alone when forced to gimp themselves with a Nightfall (Obviously this is assuming equal gear, consumables, and effort from the rest of the DPS). If you're coming at it from a purely DPS standpoint, it is easily one of the worst raiding specs in the game and there is just no way around that fact. Bear in mind that in a serious raid setting you aren't going to be able to use either Stormstrike or Flame Shock as they will overwrite far more valuable debuffs on the boss due to the debuff limit. Additionally, to my knowledge, they are the worst Nightfall wielder in terms of debuff uptime.
---
On top of all of this, Shaman not only have no innate threat reduction, but have spells with additional threat components and extremely unpredictable burst damage. Open the fight with a crit WF?  You might be eating the floor, and there's not anything you could have done about it. Ankh is the Shaman threat drop.
---
The improved totem buffs they provide over an Elemental or Restoration shaman are also extremely minimal, and do not even come close to making up the DPS loss of having an Enhancement Shaman over any other DPS spec. 
---
Stoneskin and Windwall totem are not only rarely used, but the talent that improves them grants absolutely minimal value (a whopping 6 extra damage reduced by Stoneskin in a best case scenario).  The -2 seconds from grounding totem is actually quite nice in 5-mans and PvP, but usually irrelevant for raiding.
---
Enhancing Totems provides about 12 str and agi to Strength of Earth and Grace of Air Totems, respectively.  Also bear in mind that GoA totem will only be dropped if the Enhancement shaman is totem twisting (which has a large cost to their personal DPS sustainability and healing utility), if they are the second Shaman in the group, or if there are no other melee in the group. AND if Tranquil Air Totem is not needed. 
---
Improved Weapon Totems provides a 30% boost to the 315 AP provided by Windfury Totem III on 20% of attacks - So about 19 AP on average for, at most, 4 party members. This does not in any way make up for the abysmal DPS provided by the Enhancement shaman himself.
---
Guardian and Enhancing Totems can be also be brought by a resto shaman at basically no cost.
---
All that being said, it's not entirely without upside. There isn't an insurmountable difference between a 0/30/21 Enhance/Resto shaman and a full resto Shaman in terms of healing. They miss out on Mana Tide Totem, a flat 10% healing from purity, and take a significant hit to tank healing from the loss of Healing Way, but they remain excellent raid healers that can bring non-trivial damage at minimal cost from just auto-attacking and dropping a fire totem and still devote their mana pool to healing.  
---
So coming at it from this angle, it can be somewhat advantageous to have an Enhancement Shaman or two fill healer roles if you desire a little more DPS but still need an extra healer - it's just never really worthwhile for them to take the spot over a DPS class, given the option.
---
Is it worth it over an Elemental or pure Resto shaman?  Usually not, in my personal opinion, but you also aren't going to be a hinderance to progression.
---
At least one pserver I've played on increased MC/BWL boss hp by 25% from normal. Still easy.
---
Level 1 raids on Hogger.
---
Nevada must be boring as fuck
---
This is a natural selection problem, let it sort itself.
---
I mean fat is essentially just long term calorie storage. With vitamins/minerals taken care of, I'd be more concerned about protein, but I suppose you can get it from autophagy.
---
I feel like itd be alot easier tho if you can funnel gold and gear from your main.
---
I was planning on lvling a hunter for pve/gold farming/etc , to fund a pvp alt and take it on raids on farm and stuff like that
---
Right on brother
---
This is what I was going to do, so the hunter can farm gold and raid , and pvp with a spriest alt
---
Mick, is that you mate? I wasn't serious
---
The [crafted engi gun](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16007) is better than [Blackcrow](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12651) though.
---
I am a #NoChanges champion, that being said I don't care about Sharding as long as it only covers the first lvl 1-10 zones. Trying to kill 5 boars when there are 1000000000 people trying to tag mobs would be a nightmare.
---
maybe but damn do those lips ever know how to grip
---
You totally sparked something new here. Everyone whining how they get the girls, but not the sex. Amazing. :D
---
These always end in success. Thank you for your service
---
doesn't truefaith have the 300 tailoring required to equip or can you just drop tailoring and never take it off?
---
I'll back you up with this!   
---
All the food that you miss each day, i'll eat instead!  
---
So like a.. reverse hunger strike!
---
I'm pretty sure 1.12 talents, items, 16 debuffs is muuuuch more than 30% dmg increase.
---
&gt; Fast mean no food at all, 0 calories, nada !
---
You still need vitamins and stuff. Energy is stored in fat, so if you have a lot of that you are fine for as long as it lasts, but your fat doesn't store other essential nutrients, so you will need to eat something for that. 
---
But you can survive for roughly a month with literally nothing but water. You just have a very high likelihood of getting sick, as your body is not running properly after about a week.
---
Patch 1.4 would make it phase 2 then.
---
So you‚Äôre a twig?  I‚Äôd say the wow community is split 70:30 between lardos:twigs generally speaking.
---
yes, it was compiled two days ago.. I said when it got uploaded
---
You should do a token giveaway when the release date is announced to celebrate. I'll probably play through my tokens and start paying again. I already know classic is worth $15 bucks. Retail not so much.
---
Home from work at 5PM, train mma from 05:30PM - 8PM daily.

Don't need/want more exercise, so I get home at 8:30PM and just play wow till midnight. Rinse and repeat.

No kids, no gf, just me, work, mma, wow and some lovers.

Love it.

PvE less freedom more fairness while PvP less fairness more freedom. Pick your preferred gameplay style.
---
Hey, out of curiosity how do you make these? is there a certain program you use?
---
No RP servers please waste of resources and they‚Äôll be low pop the first to die
---
it's just me refreshing the page every day hoping to get a release date and being bitterly disappointed every day.
---
Someone who isn't even 6 years old yet and weighs 120 pounds is pretty obese. The average weight of a 6 year old is about 1/3 of that.
---
;)
---
&gt;go through the top consumable list
---
Where can I find this?
---
I whish they would enforce it on non RP servers too.
---
This is a **RP**G not a FPS.
---
I save everything that isn't grey. Nobody is gonna have much gold until there are lots of lvl 60s running instances. So, you can sell it now for a fraction of what you could a few weeks after there are a bunch of 60s with gold to blow on alts and professions.
---
Ok I was under the impression with the Rag hammer they could compete mid tier in AQ40.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize that. Agreed nightfall is better in a hunters hand for spamming wingclip for 100% uptime
---
Haha i am on the same boat xd
---
Oh my God. 
---
I'm so used to the new universe. This is some trippy shit. Shaman on brother!
---
It's definitely not a AAA blockbuster, but I consider that a selling point. The fact the folks at Visionary Realms understand the style of game they're developing has a somewhat niche appeal and aren't trying to broaden that is incredibly encouraging to me.
---
I've seen enough of the properties I love brought low by some out of touch and/or ideologically-motivated executive sacrificing what made them great in a misguided attempt to bring in a larger audience. Ghostbusters, Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate; all of 'em are crap now because the folks at the top couldn't or wouldn't just let 'em be what they are. Even the MCU seems to be heading that direction post-Endgame.
---
Pantheon may not be everything I'd like to hope and dream of it being, but given the alternatives I'll happily settle for it simply being what it ought to.
---
To reach max rank some people literally shared playing a character and played nearly 24/7 between them. Earning a high level rank in classic was a huge time commitment.
---
What does "never going to delete later" mean? 
---
Broken English?
---
But like Kyle, I can totally eat and drink in the gane. I need some rest? I lay down at an inn. Why would I need to do any of that in RL?
---
Yeah that's something I'll need to get used to again. Classic has me tripping.
---
It was a Scottish dude.  I mean of course it was.
---
the time you spend on making a farm alt is likely a hundred or close to two
---
the same time you could spend farming with a rogue in normal ways for a healthy amount of gold
---
I'm not jealous of imaginary internet points - it's an example of low effort, reposted, content.
---
False. 
---
We were fighting for server firsts and sold gear for a lot of gold. Mainly MC/BWL but even AQ(20) stuff.
---
Our naxx raiding was mostly funded by the guild bank. Frost resistance, pots, flasks, repairs... Many things were covered.
---
People would pay thousands of gold for specific BWL gear, especially weapons. It was mostly alts + buyers runs that brought the money in.
---
I don't see it. If hit works like it does on Nost, +4 weapon skill will only increase your hit chance by .2 compared to the 1% of blackcrow (though, oddly enough, +5 weapon skill would effectively increase your hit chance by 3%). Further blackcrow has a slow attack speed which is purely an advantage over the crafted engi gun assuming you're going to clip your last auto to get an aimed shot off cd.
---
We are on a hype train ... choo choo ... choook'tar ogar! ... :P
---
This guy is exalted with the neckbeards
---
brd pickpocketing sucks without certain stealth talents which u arent likely to be using if you raid
---
Had 50 Mbps in Frankfurt
---
Same for our guild. It brought in tons of money, most of the buyers probably bought the gold because it was not abundant in classic.
---
It really helped us progress through AQ and naxx.
---
Shadow Priests are mana intensive and can be replaced by a single holy priest that specs down the line far enough for Shadow Weaving. The DPS a priest can pump out should be measured in Gold Per Second because of how many consumables you have to chug to keep it going. That being said I'm still playing Shadow but only for PvP, classic isn't very friendly for raid SPriests :(
---
As am I, we are gonna need a bigger boat soon!
---
yes hi i want the best class in the game at pvp, raiding, soloing, gold making, leveling and farming all combined with zero weakness whatsoever. what class is best? dont tell me just play what i like, i want a class that is perfect at everything with zero effort or gear. pref pre MC thru post Naxx too
---

---
Tell your friends goodbye, because come summer you won‚Äôt be seeing them for a long long time.

ya, memes are chitty youtube videos about what class to play or other garbage....really amazing.
---
Every day ? ... you ment every hour ? ... 
---
(... or constantly as I have notification on smartphone for new post:P )
---
I appreciate you.
---
That‚Äôs fair, by no means is it an easy adjustment for the first while. I‚Äôm proud you went out and checked out Endgame alone and had good results! Sometimes it can be nice to 100% lock in on the movie and experience it yourself. In fact, I plan to check out Endgame alone in the IMAX once more within the coming days. You take care of yourself, and keep taking those steps out. Before you know it, you‚Äôll be sprinting.
---
Outlier here. 
---
But I'll miss the transmog system and I don't find the same joys in looking like a clown practically all game. I don't feel like it makes people recognizable since...well...most characters of specific classes will just look the same/mostly the same. I don't really find the same merits other people do in looking like a doucher in their patchwork gear. 
---
But I understand not only is it unhealthy/slipper slope to have tmog but that a majority of classic players DON'T want it, and I'd prefer to have a healthy happy community over one thing a minority of players want. I'll likely be carrying around clothes in my bag specifically to wear in towns and whenever I go afk.

I feel like every new server, new expansion, new whatever, there are quest bottlenecks where you have to kill a named mob and when you get there, there are just a ton of people waiting around with 3-4 corpses of the mob on the ground lol. Decent folk will form a group so everyone gets credit but sometimes the mob gets snagged and you gotta wait 5-6 min between respawns
---
I'm talking about should.
---
Neither. It's BoP, and requires 300 tailoring to create. So you can only get it by creating it, and you need 300 tailoring to create it. But once you've created it the only major uses for tailoring are:
---
1. Making bags. 
---
2. Getting the bonus from the Bloodvine items. 
---
Which are okay, but don't really seem as interesting, fun, or profitable as alchemy.
---
If you're serious about this, and I'd highly recommend you don't follow through with it. Then make sure you take multi-vitamins, ironi, and other supplements like omega-3. Depending on your body fat percentage you can last quite a while, but your body struggles to synthesise a lot of micronutrients. And if you have low body fat then this is extremely dangerous. Your body will start breaking down protein for energy and it can struggle to tell your heart from your other muscles.
---
Was probably the sugar
---
&gt; Also keep in mind that PvP servers will generally attract a much more hardcore crowd
---
This is precisely why I play on RP-PVE servers, I started my first toon about 4-5 months after Vanilla launched so I was a little late to the game and I started on a PVP server. I had no clue wtf I was doing so I asked people around me for help or to explain how to do stuff, almost every single person I interacted with was a complete prick. Either telling me to Alt-F4 or giving me wrong directions/instructions on purpose, I came insanely close to not playing WoW just because everyone was being cuntbags but one dude whispered me and was like "Yo noob, take your ass to a PVE or RP server if your going to be an idiot."                 
---
             
---
So I rolled an Alliance Druid on Thorium Brotherhood and again came to a part where I was confused but there was this warrior also killing mobs so I asked him a question. That dude not only spent at least an hour explaining to me how to set up my spell bar, how to add action bars, what options to turn on or off he then proceeded to quest with me for hours and we together went on the massive journey from the NE starting area to Stormwind.          
---
           
---
Now sadly a few weeks later I rolled Horde and immensely loved the true faction but I will always remember that wonderful person who took the time to help me learn how to play and I've played on RP servers ever since, I dont RP but I kind of like to watch others do it and I dont spoil their fun. I also like PVP but sometimes I like to turn it off and not deal with griefers.
---
My theory is that a lot of other people here are like me, and keep this sub open all day while working, whether you're reading or not xP
---
This isn't social justice.
---
Hi, /u/MooZG
---
Dwarves are just superior in every aspect
---
To heal a dungeon requires a spell that makes hp go up instead of down, and ideally enough of a mana pool to keep casting said spell until all the mobs fall over. That's it. 20% extra healing on spell foo from talents is overkill.
---
I healed as shadow through sunken temple in vanilla. Silence was clutch given how bad most dps were at interrupts. I didn't respec into holy til mid 50s or so for strat/scholo/ubrs runs.
---
I've always found it fascinating that we're typically about half the active online subs as r/wow with less than 1/10 of their sub. Sometimes we're 1:1 with them.
---
Anecdotally, with Sulfuras, I was pretty much always in the top 5-10 throughout AQ, it's true.
---
However, I was an engineer, quite a bit more geared than a good portion of the raid, used consumables like a madman, ignored debuff priorities, and we were still bringing non-optimal specs like MS warriors and such.  And, you know, a good chunk of dead weight / AFK players.
---
If all of your DPS are equally geared, optimally specced, and putting out the same effort, that shouldn't really be the case. :)
---
University internet.  Everything downloaded fast (for that time) and ping was low... which was not great for my grades.
---
uhhh isn't this the guy who drinks his own piss
---
wouldnt say never
---
planning very long term it can become worth it
---
or if you think you will need a really huge amount of gold like for naxx progression if  u think u are hardcore
---
but if that applies to you I doubt you will have questions about farm alts
---
I'm heavily debating running a set of 10 push ups and 10 sit ups every time I level.
---
Hot
---
Have you actually progressed C'thun lol, doesn't sound like it
---
I think it just speaks to how addicting this game is, and then how addictions can be transferred into surrogate things
---
Assuming they even know its going on and think it‚Äôs legit.  
---
Or care.
---
Right but the bottom case you are referring to are tryhard progression guilds.  Which yeah unless it‚Äôs and alt raid will not take an off spec.
---
The average guild a player will run into is going to still be exactly like yours people species badly poorly geared and just happy to get 40 people in a raid.
---
Viable doesn‚Äôt = optimal all the off specs are not optimal at all but they are viable for most guilds.
---
I hoard everything white and up. Once war contribution starts they will spike in price or you can turn them in yourself for rep and chests
---
According to [https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit)
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:  
---
&gt;7% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)\*.4% 
---
300 skill ==&gt; 9% miss
---
304 skill ==&gt; 7.4% miss
---
You get better hit chance with the gun, a smidge more AP, a (little) bigger damage range and if I remember right, you don't need to clip your shots on a 3.00 speed.
---
Unless someone can convince me otherwise this will be my pre-raid ranged weapon even though I hate the gun sound !
---
So the stat weights jumps around a fair bit on your gear. Typically, in prebis gear, you sacrifice a lot of raw stats for +healing (especially once dire maul is our ex: whipvine cord), as you can downrank to manage mana - the int/spirit/stam will come with better gear. You rarely ever focus on the raw stats an item has as a priest - traditionally your main concern is +healing (and adjust from there to fit your playstyle). In prebis gear (with fire maul gear) I had about 5-5.5k mana - it‚Äôs not that much to work with, but I didn‚Äôt feel like it was ever a problem (mana pots and night dragon‚Äôs breath from felwood are your best friend at this stage). In classic you‚Äôll have more mana however, as there are less items with +healing when Dire Maul isn‚Äôt in - so more raw stat pieces are viable.
---
I personally recommend the 25/26/0 spec if you feel like you‚Äôre low on mana. You get the 10% increased mana from talents, and you only skip out on spiritual healing (that talent gives 10% increased healing). The spiritual healing talent is much weaker than many believe because it only adds 10% of the base heal without factoring in your +healing.
---
It's an example of a community connecting with each other. Your kind are why internet communities are toxic, rigid, and on their deathbed.
---
Elbows too pointy.
---
Jimmy?
---
Whats that?  You want warlock videos with crawling in my skin playing?
---
Completely agree - this is one of the annoyances of pservers.  
---
Also they have to up the respawn rate of resources far higher than it was in real classic in order to deal with having like 10k ppl on.  This completely changes the market on the server, for the worse imo.
---
Omfg i cried my ass laughing at Lazy peons.  ''Work Complete''  LUL

&gt; Only one faction per realm on PvP realms

[Damn good stuff](https://i.imgur.com/MNpGOg2.gif)

I find the memes pretty funny msot of the time. And there are some very good content topics and quides

Pretty sure it was in 1.11 and 1.12. Should be in phase 1.

ya ionno i guess its cool if others think it is
---
I accidentally boarded the wrong boat and now I‚Äôm off to ratchet.
---
That is a terrible idea
---
Tbh Riley isn't that bad.
---
The disc/shadow spec is only used in a guild that does not want to use a shadow priest (typically only super try-hard guilds that are min-maxing to the utmost). This is so that they can increase warlock dps with shadow weaving - but some guilds prefer to have a PI/shadow weaver who flash heals the raid and have an extra dps slot, over a shadow priest that does mediocre dps and can dispel when needed. I‚Äôm not bashing SP‚Äôs as I like them a lot, but some high-end guilds simply don‚Äôt use them.

Wow I've been with my girl for 12 years and I can't get her off
---
You mean you don't want any gnome rogues named "StabbyMcBallz"???
---
Thanks again. I'll be saving your replies for later!
---
I remember killing so many scorpions...
---
I feel like most people play on PvP servers for the atmosphere it creates(constantly watching you back, etc). There's also the benefit of killing people who compete with you for resources. 
---
That being said, the majority of world pvp fights I've experienced were not epic battles like you see on Youtube. The vast majority is people attacking you when you're on low hp/mana or when you're outnumbered. You will also be ganked by high lvls, but that isn't too much of a problem because you can just lvl elsewhere.
---
Surely the DM quest reward isn't phase 1 because DM isn't phase 1?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm BWL clears I usually PI warlocks (outside of PI‚Äôing the mage who pulls the technician packs for extra threat). It‚Äôs only once the mages are fire and rolling that fat ignite that PI becomes really amazing and sought after (which is the age of bug burning in AQ)
---
I look at it like bringing it to life. Like gadgetzan being much larger than what we see, like a real town.
---
To me leveling on pvp Servers was about more than just plain ganking and open world pvp. It was the psychology behind it. You are just out there questing and find a player of the opposing faction who is about the same level as you, what do you do? Do you want to test your strength or ruin his day? Are you just minding your own business, but what if he will attack you? Hey maybe u two have to go the same way into a difficult area and u communicate with emotes and clear the way together, which leads u to build a silent short bond with this Player who is basically an enemy.
---
Healing is pretty far and away the best stat in general. It improves your throughput and your regen via downranking, making it very flexible.Generally items with healing will have some int and spirit on them as well, so it's rarely a choice strictly between healing and regen. When in doubt though, go for the healing.
---
There are a few greens with high +healing that can be preraid Bis. Plenty of lists out there, though it'll remain to be seen how many of them are in at launch. Some were added with AQ.
---
Right, and as I said above having an Enhancement Shaman or two won't be a hinderance to progression assuming they know what they're doing.
---
I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from giving it a shot, but people should be aware of what they're getting into.
---
And the fact of the matter is, viable or not, it is one of the weakest raiding specs.  Putting in maximum possible effort will yield unimpressive results compared to a mage with a drinky bird on the Fireball key.
---
And the general knowledge of the game is much higher across the board than it was in 2005, so the spec will perform comparatively that much worse.
---
Insert ‚Äòwhy not both?‚Äô
---
why wait until classic for that tho?
---
laughs in pentium 4
---
To be fair, second half of the year could be referring to the quarters. May marks the end of Q2 for businesses and Q3 is considered the second half of the year. A June release is still definitely possible, albeit not that probable.
---
Riiiiight.
---
Yeah that's the point, hunter is the only class that would be in the position of, "OMG I can't believe I'm here to swing nightfall."
---
Main: Orc Hunter (w friends on pvp server)
---
Alt: Human Paladin (rp server)
---
When Rp-pvp server launches: Nelf Druid.
---
damn nearly 32 and i still get bullied alot
---
The annoying thing is how people always talk about itemisation and debuff slots trivialising content, even though 1.12 classes/talents is probably the biggest factor by far. It should be a way bigger concern and talked about way more frequently.
---
That means harder to me!  Thst slow. And ‚Äútedious‚Äù leveling is the only reason ill be touching classic
---
Yes officer, this comment right here! It made me cry.

I think a whole lot of people restraining themselves from P. Servers are going to be in for a shock, I just started farting around on one last month and sure the values on a lot of stuff is guess work but it's closer than Retail. I hear about how easy Molten Core will be but then wipe 3 times in Rage Fire Chasm over a single pat or CC getting broken, people talk about BIS gear and I'm 23 still replacing white items and losing my mind because it has +4 spirit.            
---
Pull 2 mobs? You die.          
---
Think you can solo that rare because it's only a few levels higher? You die.                 
---
Decide to smack that Alliance in Ratchet? You die.            
---

I've seen the Spirit Healer more in the past 4 weeks than I've seen in the past 8 years.             
---
Will people full clear MC within a few weeks, oh yeah definitely but 90% of us wont be a part of that and will still be wiping on trash pulls complaining not enough people have fire resist gear.
---
What about the memesters that want to RP as Trump?
---
yeah but why not just use that gold to respec? Seems like such a massive waste of time to level to 60 twice.
---
*Trump* would be an acceptable character name though.
---
Try and move me bro!
---
I feel like older WoW was literally a "Journey before destination" if I can borrow a little Sanderson there. I wasn't in a hurry to hit max level. I was excited to hit milestones like 40 to get the capstone in the talent tree. And it took enough effort that people posting "DING 37!" in guild chat was something worth congratulating.
---
These days you've got 110 poorly-paced levels where you are just GO GO GO DONT STOP GET TO 110 SO YOU START CURRENT GAME and the experience fucking blows.
---
I rather miss getting to be intimately familiar with each region. Some of it became awful grind, but still, you gain appreciation and connection to a world you actually spend time in. Nowadays it takes longer to use the bathroom than to out-level a zone. Feh!
---
*Stabbymcballz* it is.
---
Shamans can't DW in Vanilla.
---
That's really interesting.  
---
As a contractor, did you get a cut, or a flat fee?
---
I will be playing RP. Will be a good escape from the assholes and real life.
---
No, that's Bear Grylls.
---
Other than what's mentioned, here's an easy one... 
---
Get one of those adjustable grip exercisers (hand grip strengthener? dunno wtf to call it) for your forearm muscles. Sits right at your desk and you pick it up every time you die in battleground or wait on a zeppelin. Very convenient, very easy to do and remember to do (right there by your mouse), and if nothing else you'll have nice looking forearms.
---
You'll be eating soon.

Ret Palas hit like wet noodles in Vanilla.

If you tried this, I guarantee your server will become loaded with streamers. People love spiting others when there are no stakes
---
How do I burn the comment of someone else with fire? Preferable hellfire?
---
My *only* complaint, and it really is a minor one, is that I wish it was a wee bit bigger. There's plenty of desert out there, push the city boundries a bit further out and channel Booty Bay!
---
Almost the same for me lol. Then I found the noggenfogger potions, our guild would hold bets who would. Survive the ungoro jump taking noggenfogger pots.
---
Excited to max 50 characters
---
Fairly certain that if you search for 'playlist' on this sub you'll find a bunch of posts filled with music from when vanilla was current.     
---
I even posted in one or two of them because the nostalgia hit me hard when i read the posts.
---
dont call me out like this bro
---
Nope
---
I'm actually curious what this sub thinks are the classes/specs that require the least and most amount of effort. If I had to guess, it'd be hunter and kitty druid.
---
RIP having a pole arm and gun
---
Was thinking of some stretches every hour and getting some beef jerkey and pretzels for snacking (maybe making some chex mix too) but wasn‚Äôt sure what else would work.
---
Rerolling my first mains and specs. Dwarf Hunter BM/Human Fire Mage/Human combat Rogue 
---
Not raiding obv lmao
---
Best I can do is 3s 50c and I'm taking a big risk on this.
---
Reminds me of the days when I had to put my old graphics card in the oven for a few minutes every other week to play Wrath.
---
I don't really see why that's so bad but names that add 5+ vowels to get some weird variation of Legolas are okay...and I play on an RP server. I never care what a toon is named (unless offensive) as long as there is a more realistic name in the RP profile.
---
Well you would have loved Cataclysm then - or go check out Gadget in current wow - it's got a port!
---
They wrote down the wrong thing, it's from Maraudon, not DM.
---
Thank god, I want to be a proper black character not someone who just got back from a 2 week holiday in Spain.
---
Thanks. I was putting together loot lists so I can prepare ahead of time if something is Bis, side grade, or off spec (DME farming) prior to running a dungeon. Plus I'd like to know if there's something I may want to put on soft reserve in a pug. I hope to get raid geared efficiently.
---
We seriously need this. It would be a huge shame if we didn't have at least one RP-PVP server.
---
Please add salt to your water. It‚Äôll both make you more salty and keep your electrolytes up

MoP's pvp was a lot of fun
---
Refugee Point in Arathi Highlands is a makeshift camp for, well, refugees I guess, so it makes sense that they basically have a makeshift camp.  The horde have Grom'Gol Base Camp in STV which is right off the coast where they would have landed, then set up fortifications to set out on expeditions from.  I'm sure it has more to do with the lore or story for those specific zones.
---
I enjoy the new models too mostly, That said dont put them in classic becasue they do not have a warcraft or world of warcraft feel. Despite liking the new models they dont feel like they belong in wow they belong in a disney movie.
---
Man, reading through those changes in chronological order is depressing. It's like a novel about a game dying a slow death.
---
MC'ing people off the ledge in AB never gets old. Or in wPvP, using it to make them pull several mobs. You will learn a much deeper hate for rogues, though.
---
I think it's balanced. It makes up for the fact that while the Alliance has a presence in almost every contested zone, the Horde has no presence in quite a few: Duskwood, Redridge Mountains, Wetlands, Western Plaguelands (unless Chillwind Camp doesn't have a FP; I never played Alliance), and Blasted Lands (although Valormok isn't that far away).
---
I'm basing this off memory so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
---
no changes reeeeeeee
---
I think this is apt and I approve with a comment and an updoot
---
Mostly. I play a a healer on a pserver. Raid guild, so usually running guild groups. But if I am pugging something 5man, and a pally shows up saying they can tank, they are getting an inspect from me fast as anything and a them or me comment if they don't know what they are doing. A bad pally tank is just SO bad. Been burned before. (Good ones rock, met those too)
---
I see, you also enjoy r/waterniggas
---
You would be better off in some way nerfing melee than buffing hp, all you do is shift more focus onto the infinite-resource classes because you dont really lose anything early by stacking melee on almost any boss, not compared to risking going oom atleast, there is no one simple solution, flat hp increase hurts casters way more than melee in the long run
---
if he was committed to the ''hunger strike''  he would be outside blizzard HQ in a tent and actually do it , not make a post about it on reddit.Unless this is a humor post and I am overthinking it
---
My mistake, will edit now. I meant https://classicdb.ch/?item=17753 from completing maraudon, my mistake!
---
If you can promise me you won't pull boss aggro, I'll give you PI. In PvP however, we can be the best of friends. Mages are preferred because that sweet Pyroblast/PI crit just feels so good. Frost mages can bugger off.
---
World PVP is my number one. I'm looking forward to it with great excitement
---
Mandatory lobotomization!

As an Irish I fully support you but in my experience of history.. They just don't listen.

---
Personally I wish Gadgetzan is where we connect to Booty Bay. It would make the Southern part of the other continent mostly inaccessible for each faction until around lv35
---
Yes, Becasue it was warcraft. It looked like warcraft. They had some grit to them. 
---
All the new char models are ripped straight from a bootleg of disneys beauty and the beast. The new models dont look like warcraft they dont feel like warcraft (dwaves being the closest to their original)
---
Hearthstone's Gadgetzan is a victorian era industrial city that's acting like a Zootopia for Warcraft races, including Arakkoa, leper gnomes, Goren and a sizable Pandaren population. That's not bringing it to life, but completely butchering it into something unrecognizable that couldn't fit any less into the existing world.
---
Not that you can expect any better from Hearthstone, which introduced a Murloc with a british accent as part of the Explorers' League.
---
Yeah this is a total shitshow on *****Dale private server.  Always one faction or another with a few 60s outside the town sniping lowbies.
---
I'd never recommend not putting points into Disc. Just committing to full Disc for PI is highly circumstantial. That 15% mana regen while casting is a must, and reducing threat from healing is also great.
---
I mostly played during TBC so I may be incorrect...
---
Perhaps in Vanilla the gap was much lower, but I  feel mages have a button for every situation while a lock relied on preparing for an encounter well in advance. I always felt a well played frost mage shouldn't lose to anyone 1v1 while a similarly geared Lock struggled to hold their own solo.   
---
Perhaps in Vanilla the gap was much lower, but I distinctly remember being jealous of  a frost mage's two novas, blink, iceblock, c/d reset, and endless crits.
---
Wow, Actually yeah. Old powerpuff girls vs new.

Quick overview for people new to WoW:
---
World of Warcraft used to have a mildly successful trading card game, long before the launch of Hearthstone. Each expansion contained also a handful of Loot Cards, which contained a code people could use to unlock cosmetic items in World of Warcraft. 
---
Certain loot card items were available in Vanilla, 3 to be precise:
---
A Turtle Mount
---
A Hyppogryph Pet
---
And a Tabard
---
How would you feel if Blizzard would make those three Vanilla Loot Card items accesible again? Through Hearthstone, a shop or through another source?
---
If they did a time period were you could get codes or items that dropped that would be fine as long as they stayed in Classic so as not to affect retails market. I'm sure thats what you would mean as well just want to mention the importance cause you know somebody would complain that they aren't transferrable.
---
I just dont want BFA players complaining that their new model characters look bad in old texture gear becasue they really really do. 
---
Those players will keep asking to have the graphics of gear and the world updated which takes time and money to the point where Blizzard will just say no more classic wow for anyone.
---
Thats my biggest genuine fear. Can always play BFA for the new models if you REALLY need to look at them.
---
Know what? Same
---
Just started getting into shape. The Horde needs me.

are u fucked, do you know how bad rushed releases are?

I'm pretty sure you can't trade tokens.
---
play pvp for a real mmo experience
---
play pve if you want your realm to be ruined by streamers and have every chat, general, trade, looking for group, etc to become twitch chat
---
I'm hedging my bets and just upvoting this one. I reserve the right to continue to not upvote OP in future, though.
---
RP server, so we did lots of fun community stuff.  
---
"Troubadour Night" was a weekly event in an out of the way stormwind inn and share created content.  People would tell short stories, act out small skits, etc.  I used to do short stand-up comedy sets with WoW related humor.
---
I remember a guild &lt;Sisters of Mercy&gt; organized a medieval style spiritual pilgrimage to the tomb of Uther.  That was fun.  They had a surprise in store at the end in the form of a short "play" that involved a crisis of faith, a resurrection, it was well thought out.
---
And of course there was always the classic "level 1's run to Booty Bay" race, though that one was hardly unique to our server.
---
You look badass tbough
---
Digital hearthstone vanilla style would be neat.
---
As a long time FF11 player im joining because this is the game I want, I never played WoW so people cant use their pathetic "rose tinted glasses" excuse on me.  I want to play a game that takes me 6 months to max level,period.
---
theres only ONE song that should be on repeat.
---
TILL YOU DIE
---
Yup.  Transmogs we're a horrible idea.
---
Yet they took it away from live :thinking:
---
Pretty sure it was for people aoe farming SM more than maraudon back in the day, you wouldnt get much more than 5 per hour in mara unless you skip goblin &amp; crocodile boss
---
Shit man, I'm playing a Tauren Druid. I'ma be Mr. Universe by the time I get my Aquatic mount
---
Why?
---
I'm 28 yo and only 140 lbs at 6' I'd be dead by sunday
---
Mankrik here. Adventurer, I will not eat until you find my wife.
---
Real talk tho. Don't kill yourself over a dumb video game. If yer desperate to starve yourself there's better causes
---
I respect that. I agree they did kinda botch old people and colored people. As well as tauren and humans look cartoony asf. I don't want the new textures to replace the old ones necessarily. But I am open to the idea if Blizzard did a full 180 on their original ideas. I do not see it happening, but they have thrown some curveballs at us before.
---
I joined one. If you‚Äôre a competitive raider I would look now
---
Me as soon as the first crowded boat lands in Ratchet:
---
"This place is Ratchet as FUCK!"
---
Mount up and ride off before I get killed by rotten fruit.
---
All the real questions are answered except when and realmlist.
---
But remember guys, we don't actually like it, it's just nostalgia.
---
GDKP used to be popular. Never in vanilla though. I bet it would work just fine, however
---
... Or nothing.
---
Most tanks will try to hit defense cap or as close as possible, once you get into bwl gear you can afford to swap pieces for more tps. But with all gear being based on the 1.12 patch it will be harder with the 30% defense nurf that came in patch 1.10?
---
Quite a read, but was worth it. Ty for the interesting post. Rather this then the memes and same questions/posts all the time.
---
Why would you want to play as Hillary?
---
Some would even call it an MMORPG
---
Most demanded class that isn't going to be overplayed? Warrior. A lot of folks are going to roll one, but very few are actually going to hit 60.
---
IMO, the best way to ensure your success would be duo-level with a healing class to 60. Easy questing, grouping for dungeons, world pvp, and prebis gearing.
---
The Classic forum has more stickies than anyone else. They're just reducing clutter.
---
Blame the no-effort casuals who complained epics were too hard to get. Blizzard had to dumb down the game so keyboard turners could get epics and feel like winners otherwise they'd lose subscription money because people would rather quit than get good.
---
Not really carebear at all. Some people just cannot be arsed with forced world PvP.
---
BlazeitBBQ is a perfectly acceptable Destruction Warlock RP name.
---
Woah there, cowboy. You're gonna end up looking like SCP-096.
---
my god it used to drive me crazy the drones of people who would copy paste this
---
Easy: class fantasy. A paladin is a holy avenger, one who stands on the front lines dealing out support to their allies with the left hand and smiting bitches with the right. Martial might isn't all they do, but it's definitely part of the package.
---
The problem comes with the name, really. If Blizzard had simply called it the cleric none of us would be having this discussion.
---
I was really hoping hear a classic launch date in order to boost the morale after an unenthusiastic earnings report last night.
---
Damn people are so triggered now. Back in the day everyone on PvP servers said carebear.. no changes right. To be fair I get your side to cause us more competitive people are usually more aggro lol go look at a fps game server or rocket league vs. A puzzle game or some chill online shit.
---
Nineteen is the best hunter in the world.
---
It will also depend who you play with, the healers you play with and the DPS you play with. And your ability to Mark and direct and correct. Don't have to worry so much about a threat when you Mark and have DPS who adhere to that order, which then puts less stress on the Healer and helps them focus on you more.
---
You will attract the higher caliber of player and get that gear you want faster.
---
That's not formula for hit that Nost used. I'd bring up the old formula (there was actually a big thread on the old Elysi--um subreddit that got taken down) that referenced directly to the nost core github.
---
It turned out if defense skill - weapon skill &lt; 11, then the formula it used was 5% miss + .1% x defense skill - weapon skill. Meaning with 305 skill, the chance was 5% + .1%x10 = 6%.
---
But if the difference in defense skill and weapon skill was greater than 10, then the formula was 5% + 1% per level difference + .04%xdefense skill - weapon skill. Hence the old 8.6% number that you probably heard thrown around if you've played on private servers. Meaning that the +4 weapon skill on the gun would only increase your hit from 8.6% to 8.44% - so you'd still need 9 hit to be hitcapped.
---
I'm curious what the source is for that classic wow hit calculation. Is that's what's being used on ND?
---
&gt;You get better hit chance with the gun, 
---
Only if the hit works like your wiki says and not the nost core
---
&gt;a smidge more AP, 
---
Indeed, and a smidge more crit chance too, .16% crit from 4 wep skill. But it's not enough to make the difference.
---
&gt;a (little) bigger damage range 
---
I think I lost you here. Blackcrow's damage range is better, before you even calculate DPS from AP and arrows. 65+122=187 (flawless arcanite) 77+117=194 (blackcrow). Of course, with prebis and raid buffs, you're easily going to clear 100 bonus DPS from ap and arrows, so with blackcrow's slower .2 AS, you can add another +20 onto blackcrow's already bigger number
---
&gt;and if I remember right, you don't need to clip your shots on a 3.00 speed.
---
You need to clip with blackcrow (Assuming no rapid fire or improved aspect of the hawk), so you certainly will need to clip for flawless arcanite, since it is a faster weapon, not slower weapon.
---
Yeah, this is strictly about Classic. 
---
But also a consideration when if Blizzard decides to move on to TBC realms (with even more available Loot Cards).
---
I like how nothing on the map has been explored yet.
---
Considering the overwhelming majority of this type of content is painfully dry and often monotone, you should have no problem finding something more suitable for you tastes.

That's from TBC.

I am sorry to diss you, I'm not one to be an ass about stuff usually but I love my lore and can't stand the whole fun-hip speech like graysfordays overuses all the time.

---
Guess I just prefer boring winding textbooks
---
First off RP servers are not a waste of resources. World of Warcraft is a M M O R P G. The last three letters says it all. The game‚Äôs heart and soul is rooted deeply in role playing. You cannot truly go home again, experience the nostalgia, and return to the best time in Azeroth without role playing servers. Classic had these options and it is imperative they exist at the relaunch of the game we all loved and enjoyed for years.
---
Gamertags or other character names that do not follow a lore and role playing standard naming conventions will pollute the game world and break immersion if not enforced. True character names that fit in the lore and the game world draw players deeper into the world we all share, breathing more life into it. It lends itself to the story the game tells and the ones we will tell interacting with each other.
---
Come on summer!
---
A warrior tank who can *hold threat* will be able to have his pick of spots.
---
Hahah nah
---
You're going to carry different sets for different fights.  A lot of it depends on what you healers can handle and how much threat your dps is generating.
---
At the start I think it's safe to go for mitigation.

as hord / alliance have different strengths when it comes to dungeons accessible.
---
Do you split the money between **everyone** (including the buyers) or only the core players? This is the part that doesn't make sense to me. Most explanations seem to imply they split the money with the buyers as well. But then what do you do with useless people who join the raid as buyers, get carried, don't bid on anything, and still end up getting an even cut for absolutely no effort? You could argue against them getting a cut based on merit/judgment made during or after the run, but that's a sure recipe for drama. I feel like the core players doing the carrying and the buyers need to be clearly distinguished before the run starts, and only those players doing the work should split the pot.
---
I participated in these during WotLK but I don't remember exactly how it worked.
---
Yeah I'm already assuming they will make that stuff accessible through Hearthstone. They need a way to implement those classic items, and Hearthstone has been losing popularity lately, seems like a no brainer.
---
Just be prepared for the complainers.

Warriors in particular are WAY better post rework. At original launch (and in MC) both tanks and DPS used Arms spec because the other 2 specs were so crap.

With warriors being the best tanks and DPS these talent buffs were huge

First time I've ever actually read it. I only ever saw it posted in fundamentally stupid context by stupid people.

The weird thing is that he's right about more than he's wrong about. Many fair points made. The problem is that his fundamental premise is based upon his assumption, which is sloppy stuff. 
---
"Blizzard will never make Classic. That is why I know that Blizzard is uninterested in making Classic." Nice logic there, bud.
---
I want to see boss armor buffed. It would reduce the most broken raid dps (rogues/wars) thereby reducing overall raid dps, without punishing already somewhat weak casters.
---
I'm planning on mostly doing dungeons and solo world PvP, I heard that the hunter was a good pick, is it though ? If not, which class would you recommend ? Thanks
---
revolt
---
Warriors are the best DPS and the only viable tank.
---
Paladins are the worst DPS and the worst tank (even Druids are better).
---
On a recent server project, I kept seeing the same paladin all throughout my journey to 60. He was leveling at nearly the same speed as me. He beat me to level 60 by a couple levels, but we had seen each other and sneaked up on each other a couple times and did /wave before the other noticed. I don't remember his name but I remember going to the destroyed inn in Dustwallow and he was there grabbing the same items I was.  
---
I love interacting with the opposite faction in a positive way.
---
Get to 60, raid to tier 2 and then pvp till my face falls off
---
I feel like people are wayyyyy exaggerating how much ganking and camping occur. In my experience, yeah of course it happened, but it‚Äôs not like you couldn‚Äôt level or play the game. PvP allows for some unique interactions. It guarantees that your journey 60 will never be the exact same as someone else‚Äôs. Also means leveling your alts will always be different. PvP adds challenge and danger to the world
---
I honestly did not remember that quest givers did not have question marks after completed quests.
---
Sounds good.
---
Harming yourself solves nothing. They'd have to care about the community genuinely first.
---
It needs to be said that High Threat Tanking (for any given WoW iteration) is not Progression Tanking. That's not to say some ultra hardcore PS Guilds aren't going to come in and smash the content up but for the rest of us it's going to be standard tactics until stuff is on farm.
---
Op top of which, the truth is High Threat Tanking is actually a lot easier on the tank than the healers. You get to rely a lot more on rotation and much less on fitting in survival cooldowns while the healers have to keep you from being 2-shot the entire fight. If you can tank properly, you can hit a rotation so probably focus on the tanking part first.
---
I‚Äôm sure there will be a lot of tanks but they will probably still be needed, tanks and healers in general are something always useful and dps will always be a dime a dozen.

guild banks arn't even the greatest function TBH, you can just literally make an alt and use it as a guild bank, if a officer is storing loot with that, the odds of stealing are no different. So I think i redact my earlier statement and say the only thing out of all the expansions that is a loss is the ? quest turn in
---
&gt; Through Hearthstone, a shop or through another source?
---
I didn't find them distasteful during Vanilla and TBC because they were sourced from something that required commitment to a completely different hobby. That is to say, the people who got the items tended to either be genuinely interested in the CCG or at least got the items from someone who was. Because of that when I saw their things (or their Blizzcon mounts) I thought, "Good for them!" and felt happy for someone.  
---
I would NOT like goodies coming from digital sources however. That's too close to a cash shop since they'd be created and acquired through a digital Battle.net service. If I'm paying a monthly subscription I do not want to feel pressure to pay more.
---
Welcome r/memestockexchange to the world.
---
Yeah, many tanks will quit before level 20. Finding tanks for dungeons 20+ will be hard.
---
let me in, LET ME IIIIINNNNNN
---
Only fair point I could see was Blizzard didn't deem it profitable enough at the time and now presumably it does.
---
Most of it is really dumb, of course Classic enthusiasts have some idea of the so called QoL features. Blizzard outright losing the code and facing a technical impossibility to recreate Classic? Come on
---
You mean microtransactions in classic? nty
---
So I‚Äôve actually thought about this in depth.
---
My plan is to do strength training once a week Sunday morning. full body, compound lifts only. I‚Äôll be doing pull ups, followed by hex bar dead lifts and than push ups until failure. 
---
Quick, easy, effective and unless you eat like a body builder you‚Äôll be able to maintain your genetic potential with just those 3 exercises. 
---
Monday - Friday I‚Äôll be doing a morning burpee routine for cardio before work. Takes roughly 10 minutes and is medically proven to be all that your heart needs in terms of exercise. I can get you the name of medical journal that was published if you care to look that deeply.
---
I'm not gonna let Classic affect my life. I'm still gonna go to the gym. I'm still going to take care of my daughter. I'm still gonna go to work. I'm just gonna play Classic WoW in my free time.
---
Yes I will have urges to play WoW while I do those other things. Yes, I'll want to stay home instead of go to the gym or take care of the house, but I'm an adult, I can handle doing things that I don't wanna do or not do something that I want because I have to have priorities.
---
I mean personally the more time I play games the lower my weight goes /shrug
---
The guild bank issue is more about the fact that without them it basically forces guilds to break the TOS and account share. Since guild banks are pretty much a necessity you might as well make them official through blizzard.
---
Famous rapist.
---
Heh most of this I've bought used to be honest. Also my computer is almost 8 years old... Time for an update...
---
I'd roll a tank on a private server and see if you actually enjoy it first.
---
Real wow doesn't have pandas as creatable characters, or doesn't have pandas as a quirky in game Pet? We know which came first, haha.
---
*Pictured: Israel circa 1944*
---
Hahha
---
I think there will be an overload of warriors and a pretty large number of feral druids too.  
---
To what extent they will all tank, who knows.
---
How would you heal without the points in holy then?
---
My guild tried this towards the beginning of Classic but there wasn‚Äôt enough money in the economy to do much. Towards the end, though, we were basically selling AQ and Naxx because we didn‚Äôt need anything. We‚Äôd bring 15 people and have them bid against us.
---
Just note that this can create problems with stupid people buying though. Thadius we‚Äôd have them kill themselves to not mess us up, but there was often an idiot that wouldn‚Äôt listen and wipe us anyway.
---
hmm never heard of it, but the steam page alone looks impressive. thanks
---
Damn sucks for you, MoP was one of the best expansion experiences for me after WotLK and BC.
---
Why stop there? Get some dumbells. Probably those ones with little adjustable weights. You can work out just about any muscle with 2 dumbells. Deadlifts, squats, lunges, just look up some exercises. You can get a full body workout between pulls, while flying, while dead, etc.
---
yea i know i tried it too with all sorts of good gear, pvp and pve, it was just bad for pvp to DW
---
Ive tanked some mythic+ dungeons on bfa for the last few days, as a prot warrior even. 
---
But bfa tanking and vanilla tanking is probably different. 
---
Also does instant level 60 private servers exist? And if so do people do dungeons there or only raids? Cba levling 1-60 now.
---
Probably is an understatement
---
Same. I'm guessing Blizz will use MC as a testbed to see how quickly and wipelessly players can zoom through it.
---
I've spent the last 30 minutes scouring for the original post using my Google-fu and Battle.net's search options, but I've come up dry. My only assumption is that the original thread was deleted.

Here's what I did come up with:
---
* The OP was a fellow named Aberzombie of the realm Echo Isles

* As mentioned, I did not find the original post, but I did find him talking about the [original post in a thread from December 2012.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/7415794858?page=6#post-102)

As you can see, the wall was of its infancy, and he formatted and added onto it as time past. By Feb of 2013, [it started to resemble what we see now-a-days](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/7924334037?page=1#post-20).
---
The video is based off of Xrewz's route as mentioned in the description, I think this pathing is by far the fastest to get an early lead, but some of these quests are probably very unreasonable on classic launch, however it really comes down to how much sharding will affect launch day.  
---
You also wanna pick up stuff first aid earlier which i kind of dropped just to level faster.  
---
And yeah its not really all the way to level 10 because I die in Gol'Bar quarry, but if you're the first person to get there I don't think it's going to be a problem at all.
---
Rogue's Sap will help in 5 mans. the DPS is good in PVE. They are great in PVP.
---
Warlock fear is nice. Seduce is a good CC for humanoid. They are good dps in pve and good in pvp.
---
/shrug
---
I'd go rogue if you enjoy pvp, and stealth is nice. Warlock is like a hunter in how easy it is to level tho.

Its really only good for maybe soaking up some damage in pvp or leveling balance, otherwise bear form balance pvp spec is still better endgame. I do enjoy being a lazer chicken though

Most wow players have ember done a pull-up. Most people haven‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm actually not! Colorado born and raised. We don‚Äôt have in ‚Äòn out here, but I‚Äôve been to them and it‚Äôs pretty good. I like five guys more though.

If you really wanna min/max your time and don't mind eating the same thing every day for a week, get into meal prepping. Especially if you have a slow cooker. Take one day and just make your meals for the week. Then the other 6 days you just gotta nuke a plate.

People already talk about how the wow community are unhealthy. This will not help people to understand wow players in a positive light.

So nothing will change?

I'm sorry but not, you can't even make current wow hard, even if you pull like 10+ mobs.
---
Hey you should probably focus on getting PBIS on the tanking list if your raiding. For DW tanking I believe he said he wouldn‚Äôt suggest it until near the end of T1 gearing. Honestly I think you should kinda figure out that aspect after MC and save it for 5 mans to test in. This is my plan to focus on good defense gear then once I get that I‚Äôll begin working on pieces that will be better for threat.
---
Warry wollte ich spielen und hab 11 Punkte :D also warry so wie fr√ºher.
---
But there was a panda in warcraft 3...
---
MoP is a sleeper hit for sure. I'd put it in par with very early cata right under wotlk, and above the rest of cata and every other post-wotlk expansion. 
---
The theme turned a ton of people off but they missed out on the really great content and class design.
---
No changes!
---
I'm going PvP, obviously.
---
Communities and guilds tend to be stronger on these, not to mention you get to actually interact with the other faction.
---
I'd be all for it. There are tons of armor "sets" that can be crafted or pieced together from world drops (Alabaster, Thorium, Imperial, Ect.)  and I'd love to be able to mog them.
---
Many of those sets have an extremely broad level range between all the pieces so you'd likely never end up wearing a full set while it's relevant to your character's level.
---
Also they can add the barber shop too. Another unpopular opinion I expect.
---
Druid healer, sorry m8.
---
Goblin towns have always made me super weary about the opposing faction. Booty Bay and Gadgetzan were frequent places of unexpected skirmishes or assassination. 
---
But nevertheless, the tension helped with the immersion. And the tense atmosphere helped with emphasizing that we were in a dangerous zone and we are far away from home, on the edge of civilization.
---
Warcraft 3 had a pandaren in it.. pandaren are canon.
---
Wotlk and BC are referred as the best expansions because they have been relly expansions to vanilla without overhauling the whole game. 
---
Havent really played MoP but the few weeks i played it, i really enjoyed it. Back then when gameplay mattered for blizz ;)
---
You could pick any class with those parameters.
---
I support you !
---
dagger/mace/axe and shield or 2h mace/axe, no dual wield.

Because in the setting of Reddit the real difference between life or not life is clicking someone‚Äôs profile. Weak ass arguments old man.
---
How else am i gonna get Drake Fang Talisman and Band of Accuria on my Hunter?
---
Yeah, just wait for someone to pull aggro. I remember that most (or even all) raid bosses were immune to taunt.
---
Undead's better for PvP and Gnome is better for PvE
---
How does MC work anyway? Like if I‚Äôm on the boat coming into booty bay and I MC a dude into attacking a B.B. bruiser what happens?
---
Not unless they increase the server caps.

Can start with hanging there.

Damn i always loved the pvp shoulder set on my Dwarf soooo huge
---
So this was the weekly update? Lol.
---
I love the hunter class but get used to hearing "we don't need another rdps, we have a warlock\mage" when trying to group up.
---
I actually haven‚Äôt had one in years but you guys have inspired me I‚Äôll go get one!
---
I have  played in both server types for years.
---
I am currently 30 i will play with  another 2 friends.I think the PVE experience suits me better now...try to enijoy the lveling and the quests while drinking my bacardi... and the PVP is seriously not half bad. There are constantly raids on darkshore and Barrens..and u always have the BGs.
---
Yeah i think i am going PVE this time around
---
You must not be part of the #nochanges group. IMO since loot cards were in vanilla we shouldn't have an issue with them in classic. The implementation is what needs to be looked at closely.
---
Well I was there, so I think I know what resources I used to prep for raids.  But go ahead and believe whatever you want.
---
Glad you guys are enjoying PvP servers. Just for the sake of those still deciding between PvE or PvP, you can enjoy world pvp on a PvE server. All you have to do is flag yourself for pvp. You‚Äôll get plenty of battles because people can‚Äôt resist that red name plate and there are plenty of people running around flagged. Tarren Mill and Southshore will be alive and well. The bonus is you get to turn it off when you need a rest from fighting. For some people it‚Äôs nice to have that choice. PvE servers will have plenty of pvp if you want it.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what the fuck are you on about?  Lava packs were the topic of discussion.  I raided MC a lot, you didn‚Äôt fucking need FR gear for them.  If you think you did, your guild was full of idiots who cleared trash much more slowly than necessary and that‚Äôs fine.  I could give a fuck.
---
Only classes worth playing are mage, warrior, warlock, priest and rogue, moving on
---
Current wow is designed with you pulling 10 mobs at once, vanilla wasn't.
---
That's like saying that MC is hard because I cant solo it.
---
doubt
---
technically does. Or rather references them. If you're horde.
---
Im a part of the #Nomicrotransactionsinmmorpgs group. You must be a #paypig :P
---
A Mage is always welcome in dungeons and raids because of great cc, the ability to produce refreshments and portals, spell steal, and remove curse.
---
If you're decide to go with pve dps instead then Mage is the way to go.
---
That's the thing. Warriors don't use it in PvE, therefore is not an upgrade for PvE.
---
It's an upgrade, and best in slot for PvE AND PvP for Hunters. You take our BiS item is like us taking your BiS 1h weapon. Unfair.
---
If instantly you mean kill 2 trillion boars, than sure.
---
I found it kinda interesting looking through the list of changes that were made since Vanilla, and asking myself "did this actually make the game better?" I counted a total of 18 changes since 1.12 that I actually think were good for the game, and most of those were minor UI changes and things that didn't affect gameplay (e.g. colourblind mode, GM chat window, double-wide quest log). Comparatively, I counted 59 changes that I thought actively made the game worse. The rest were changes that I didn't have any particular opinion on.
---
I got out of a 5 year relationship fairly recently as well, but I've been having a decent amount of sex. Honestly I miss the company of my best friend as well, finding someone you enjoy spending time with who feels the same way about you is really rare, and hard to get over.
---
lolumad
---
Vanilla tanking is quite the ordeal. With BFA you can pretty much hold aggro without even trying. A big thing for tanking in Vanilla you will need to have some minor DPS pieces to help hold aggro as well as having to tab target often. Warrior AoE abilities (Thunderclap, Whirlwind, etc)  have a limit on how many targets it can hit so you have to tab and sunder quite often to hold groups of mobs. Would be good to try it on a private server before leveling one. Might help you decide. Plus if you a good mage/rogue, people will want you in groups. Good DPS &gt; Dead DPS.
---
Enjoy one for me üò≠
---
If your problem with retail wow is pandas then I don't know what to tell you.
---
That guy in Duskwood for like one quest in the game, and is really a Swamp of Sorrows thing.  There isn't a flight path or anything there.
---
I'm pretty sure I'd have gotten over her a lot faster if I had had sex since.  But I can't seperate sex from the emotions involved, and think I've grown so much by being alone for a while.
---
It was always nice to enjoy quests and then enter certain area to Flag PvP and get a taste.  But....  having the ability to go back to the grind un-interrupted.
---
Don't forget about making sure to have your Complete Breakfast of coffee, cereal, toast, fruit, bacon, sausage and eggs, milk and OJ. It's the most important meal of the day.

Press F to pay respects

Both Shamans and Hunters are pretty easy to gear compared to most classes.
---
Once we get a release date this place is gonna be a ghost town lol
---
Which is my point that getting the inner spirit buff isn't really a sacrifice at all, but dropping at least spiritual guidance for PI is a really massive sacrifice, and if you add on the 10% healing it's even bigger.
---
This thread has great insight and should be up-voted on the sole basis that no one is talking about server selection!  This matters.
---
It definitely makes sense to level an alt if you‚Äôre a warrior, especially if you make use of rested xp. It‚Äôs really only about 2 days of played time on a mage before you‚Äôre making the same or better gold/hr you could make on the warrior. So it‚Äôs only about 48 hours to recover. You will easily recover that time over the course of 6 months. Plus throw in the extra professions and the ability to multi-box in certain situations.

&gt; Blizzard outright losing the code and facing some technical impossibility to recreate Classic? Come on
---
Not impossibility. But that is still the official story actually. The reason they decided to do classic in the end was partly because they did find an old backup. And it has been quite a lot of work to make it run the same way it did back in the day but with a new engine. Or in case it wasn't a lot of work, it's not going to run the same way it did, which is a definite possibility.
---
Hinterlands sucks for alliance. Way better for horde
---
IMO leveling is way too quick. Should take 6-7 times as long.
---
remember to eat some salts and stuff
---
but a skittle is one color
---
fresh sub
---
I thought about making a post about it. Horde has objectively better leveling experience compared to the alliance. More quests more camps more flight paths better geography locations etc. I heard that alliance quests came before the horde so maybe thats why
---
Lol ur the type of person that will /wave the opposing faction when they are flagged taunting you. You wouldn't last on a PvP server kid
---
Classic Mobile Royale
---
Lol but that‚Äôs just ignorant because your ‚Äúaccurate information‚Äù is your biased opinion as a warrior that doesn‚Äôt want anyone else to take ‚Äúyour weapon‚Äù. 
---
‚ÄúImagine the situational DPS increase I will do! Because it‚Äôs more means I should get it‚Äù
---
Just chill my friend. Your opinion has been heard, but that‚Äôs all it is.
---
I'm convinced that a lot of the people who say they want to play prot warrior (whether that's actual sword and board prot or fury/prot with DW) didn't actually tank back in Vanilla or even TBC.  You had a shortage of good tanks back then because your tank's threat limited your raid DPS in a lot of ways, and with the fury warrior meta thats going to be even more true now.
---
There's always going to be tanks. But good ones will be wanted as they were back then.
---
I wouldn't mind having the mechanics changed so people have to re-learn the fights again. Part of the fun about vanilla was that no one knew the fights going into it. 
---
Increasing the stats of the bosses just means you have less room to make mistakes. It's harder for the sake of being harder. I don't know if that would be any more fun for me.
---
You only watch videos of things you've already seen? Wut.

I don't RP either, but like you I ended up with a main character on an RP server (a friend played there, then quit). Even though I didn't RP, I set up a hotkey to emote "sorry". I did this because I kept accidentally riding through the middle of RP gatherings. I can respect their game, even if I keep to myself.

I played a hunter at first and went Dragonscale Leatherworking. Made myself the full black dragonscale set and was good to go for raiding. Abandoned him before AQ, but I also could have crafted full nature res.

Funny thing, I actually found Tanaris (and Gadgetzan) one day when I wondered where I‚Äôd end up if I swam south from the docks at Theramore. I was coincidentally the right level for the area (41 IIRC) and after being slightly dumbstruck by finding a new zone the way I did, I started questing there!
---
I believe I had been through Shimmering Flats at that point already but I somehow didn‚Äôt find the path to Gadgetzan until I stumbled across it from the Tanaris side and was like, ‚Äúoh, *that‚Äôs* how you‚Äôre supposed to get here‚Äù.
---
I really hope not but yeah.  At least until the mechanics changes becune apparent and everyone comes back to bitch and bump the ‚Äúo told u so‚Äù posts.
---
Female nelf hunter. Best run animation imo. And since you‚Äôre hoofing it until at least 40, it‚Äôs worth having a run animation you don‚Äôt hate.

As time goes on that will shift towards the overweight person though.

Ugh it's the worst. Those breakfasts are so good, but it basically has to be the only meal of the day at that point.
---
You mean that afterthought of a camp down by the shore that doesn't have a flight path?
---
It is the same game, and meant to be a faithful recreation. The hardware doesn't matter at all since this is a game design decision. The code may be different, but it is meant to emulate the game as it was during vanilla. Why would you make a huge design change while striving to get everything else just right?
---
That run is a motherfucker.  I'm not sure it's worth it. I'm pretty sure

 you can get decent staves with high dps and spirit around then and those are actually better.

Sm's not THAT bad for Alliance. You run up from Arathi.  RFC is a no-go for you, obviously.  Deadmines for horde is just.. a massive fucking run for not a lot of gain. Stranglethorn up to Westfall through Duskwood. Screw that.
---
dont u have to respec for pvp btw

I never realized how nice horde have STV. Their camp has walls, guards, zeppelin; it‚Äôs a damn Walmart compared to ally‚Äôs little lemonade stand up there

There are a lot of people selling all kinds of boosts on retail, so that will surely carry over to classic. Don't remember how it was on private servers when I played (had trade chat disabled), but probably similar. Not sure how popular your exact system is anymore though. At least on retail, anything where you could bring a large amount of pugs to is not really worth paying any gold for since you could just do it entirely with pugs for free instead. I think most boost runs on retail are just a few people getting boosted, not half the raid. Also Blizzard ruined the loot system (as an active BfA player that is one of the changes I *actually* hate...), so it limits things somewhat.
---

I did just fine with PvP, back with SWG, and even through TBC + Wotlk on alt characters. I just can't be arsed with it nowadays.

This is hilarious.  Id say heads of business at ActiBlizz have been eating rotten crow with dirty feet in their mouth, but in reality they are eating fresh Alaskan King Crab with pure Colombian cocaine lining their nose all the while loling straight to their bank.

/r/waterniggas
---
Yup, and it will be even easier and more profitable in vanilla. Think of how many free spots you could have in Molten Core and still make it through after you are done gearing up from it. You only need 3-5 Naxx geared players to kill Onyxia. Doing class quest runs might make some money. This is going to be a big business later on, and I hope gold selling/buying is delt with harshly so people can't buy gear with cash.

It would make the world smaller.  Everyone deserves to have to do the walk through the Thousand Needles and salt flats at least once.

I remember getting to the "Create your Garrison" part where you have to interact with the spyglass, and everybody was crowded around the thing. It didn't work. Everyone who was playing got stuck there until they took the server down and applied the fix
---
Another "look how far we've come"/"thanks for listening Blizzard!!!" post... Im just as excited as anyone but Christ these posts are repetitive af.

A huge number of those "features" added were to the detriment of the game.

It's truly gross how often people eat. This is only fine if you're an athlete trying to gain mass.
---
&gt; . Which is literally every fight in Vanilla WoW
---
Lol so yeah, every fight except the actual hard ones where you will be dead weight.
---
I just think that many of the druids will be playing feral and hoping to tank, not necessarily that there will be a huge number of druids compared to other classes.
---
I'm going to play what I want and what I seem as fun and viable. I'm not in a top guild or anything so I dont need to make a rouge or made

Not sure for specific matchups but if you want to check out some vanilla PvPers, well there aren't really that many. GreatWizard is the most popular one i think, but i'm not sure how good he really is

I thought the Wall of No had its uses, in so much as it discussed *why* it likely would never happen, including blue/dev quotes on the probability of it ever happening at the time.
---
I didn't like the condescending, pejorative manner in which it was posted, though, purely to spitefully shoot down the idea. I don't think the Wall of No was in and of itself bad (though obviously grossly outdated now), but I'd have liked to see it used more constructively and informatively rather than as a snide insult to somebody asking bout legacy servers.
---
You forgot Hjyal!
---
There are a whole bunch of portals that aren't used:  Duskwood, Feralas, Ashenvale come to mind immediately.
---
The only reason I'll be logging into retail is to farm a bit of gold each day. I would just pay 15, but money is tight. Plus I feel like just 30 minutes a day can cover it.
---
Classic baby the hype is real!!!!
---
Aussie players let's go!
---
Never said they "lost" it, just said they didn't save it. Which I could imagine being true, like not having official backup servers with stuff that far back. Obviously it was saved on some computer somewhere, which could have been expected. But I think you are overestimating how structured backups a company will have for 10+ year old data no longer in use.
---
&gt; consume shrimp
---
nice try, blizzard
---
But then you'd have to play Alliance.
---
I actually like warrior and tanking in vanilla, my worry though is the weirdness of offspecs etc. Being stuck as a tank seems quite restrictive, unless you are willing to spend loads of redoing your talents all the time.
---
It would more likely mean the revival of true good MMOs! Which I personally hope they do a Star Craft universe MMO extremely vanilla inspired. They would become gods of the gaming world again.
---
Back when old feenix private server used to exist there was a lot of "GDKP" runs. where you bid gold for items that drop and total gold is then shared at the end of the run. 
---
You often had to show that you had lots of money in able to join the raid, or have very good gear to carry. 
---
there even was GDKP runs for naxx.
---
Meanwhile, actual people are literally starving to death, but OP somehow feels their entitlement to a video game is more important.  A pessimistic outlook of humanity exists, indeed.
---
Do you think the users here know about women?
---
At this point I don't really care about character limits.   
---
I feel like i'd be fine with a post-summer release as long as we get a date for it so my boss can stop asking me to book my holiday.
---
Up to a certain level it's fine because the healing talents only give you so much.  
---
With that said, the stronger your tank is defensively the more likely you will be able to heal as shadow.  The better your cc.  Etc.
---
Once you get past lvl 45 or so it gets harder, but with good tanks and solid dps and great cc it's completely doable.
---
Once you're doing 50+ dungeons then either you want to be outgearing the content or be specced to heal imo.  Healing a fury warrior tank as a shadow priest is likely to be a shitshow somewhere like UBRS.
---

---
The topic is not if it would be good or not to add content to classic, we don't care about that it's another subject, it would be optionnal servers and approved by the community, stop downvoting for no reason
---
LOOOOOL
---
getting that typical WoW body back bro
---
As tired as I am of these threads, I have an opinion to share. I *absoltely* don‚Äôt want them to remake older content. The design of Cata zones and dungeons, for example, would stick out like a sore thumb in the world of Azeroth. There are still options available. One you didn‚Äôt mention was the Azshara furlbog gate at Boars head. 
---
2nd point... TBC and Wrath, while keeping each xpac pure, is the obvious, cheap, non intrusive answer. I think Kara Crypts would be cool but couldn‚Äôt it sideline other Vanilla content? Say Blackstone ring got outdone by a sweet blue from the crypts, now it‚Äôs harder to get people to run Mara, the actual Vanilla content.
---
TBC&gt;&gt;&gt;Vanilla&gt;WotLK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all other wow expansions
---
Yeah I didn't talk about Hyjal in the cut content since it was released later, just like old outland, caverns of time etc.
---
Those portals are for the emerald nightmare and they are actually used in the Legion raid
---
Play whatever you want.  If you are good, you won‚Äôt have a problem getting into groups.
---
This game is more social than retail, if you are a cool person and okay your class well, you‚Äôll never have a problem getting a party.
---
Why was it fun for PvP sir? didn't even try a pally and interested to know about pvp
---
As someone who collects the WoW TCG, I even think having these items as rare drops would take away some of the commitment I put into collecting the Heroes of Azeroth set. 
---
I do hope we see Landro Longshot make a return in Booty Bay.
---
Although I do remember card code 'duping' became an issue in retail at some point. Which greatly effected the market in game and the second tier market for us TCG collectors. 
---
I think as some have pointed out implementing it would be the issue, I think something simple such as providing proof you have the card and not just a code (Which could be purchased via a 3rd party online), would suffice.
---
Rogues are fine at farming gold, in fact, I think they‚Äôre the best.
---
Once geared, you‚Äôll wreck mobs in 1-2 seconds.
---
Not enhancement shaman though bro :(
---
This isn't accurate.   By going for PI you miss out on both Spiritual guidance (25% of spirit as spell power) AND spiritual healing (10% increased healing).  It's a significant sacrifice because outside of PI, what you get for those last 10 points in the disc tree is not that helpful.  10% mana is nice, but that's about it.
---
They could go anywhere though, since we're a back in time alternate reality type ting.  The one that opened to the Outlands doesn't even need to open there if they want to do new content.  I was just building from features already present in the world that don't do anything in Vanilla.
---
Im all for it because my retail account owns like 15 tcg items. My favorite are my flag of owner ship, etheral soul trader, and of course my swift spectral tiger. But i also have flying mounts from the tcg. I think it would be too difficult to figure out where to draw the line.
---
well it's more to play a different class all together in pvp
---
i like hunters in pve but im more interested in like a warlock or rogue for pvp, personally
---
It‚Äôs sad but I can relate too well to this thread
---
Kinda wish they created new content with the vanilla style and gameplay intact. But that goes against the essence of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and veers off into different territory. Besides I don‚Äôt think current blizzard would know what to do and could fuck it up.  There‚Äôs always TBC!
---
&gt;  One you didn‚Äôt mention was the Azshara furlbog gate at Boars head
---
Ooo.  That's a good one.  I forgot about that!
---
In vanilla gnomes were one of the only races that could not be warriors. It wasn‚Äôt until cata or wotlk that gnomes could be warriors.
---
I'm a 10 minute walk away from my gym, so I'm planning to go in the middle of the day to give myself a break from WoW and get the blood flowing
---
This topic isn't for the \#nochanges kids.  This is for people who like to use their imagination and to dream a little.
---
Generally, the money is only split between the guild members that attend.  
---
Some other comments mentioned contractors, which makes sense - Hiring strong players who want to make some money to join the raid and get the same split at guild members.
---
&lt;Deus Vult&gt; Horde, PvE
---
We are recruiting for Classic, we currently have over 35 members, and growing daily.
---
Our officer core is made up of dedicated raiders who have led top guilds before.  We are going to kill bosses and we‚Äôre going to have fun doing it.
---
We raid on Friday and Saturday night, 11pm - 3 am EST (8pm to 12am PST)
---
Currently recruiting all classes.
---
Drop me a DM if you‚Äôre interested, and if the raid times work for you!  See you in Azeroth! :)
---
Ive wanted this since i first heard wow was coming out haha
---
We need to see ketone test strips! I want to make sure you‚Äôre not sneaking any sugar or carbs :)
---
C‚Äôthun and 4 Horseman are some of the most mechanically challenging fights in the game.
---
It is known
---
Where the portals are the 4 dragons of nightmare spawn if you didn't know
---
So it's pretty obvious where they go
---
I've never had a problem with silly names on RP servers. I played for years on Moon Guard and Wyrmrest Accord. An addon such as MyRolePlay will change character names in chat if they're using the addon as well and have entered a character name in their MRP profile.
---
I will personally will roll on a PVE server this time.
---
I go raiding naked and halfway through someone notices and everyone yells at me.  Why does this keep happening to me?
---
ding ding.
---
It's the same effect, but in later patches they just distilled it down into its own @mouseover function. This made it easier on character limits, etc
---
Hi, /u/FlackRacket
---
The best damn show
---
Why do you do regular fasting? I'm a bodybuilder so my idea of eating is probably different from yours but fasting seems like a bad way to treat your body. What would the medical benefit be of not eating at all for 48 hours instead of, say, only eating fruit/veggies for 48 hours?
---
I disagree, 90% of the mobs you end up fighting as you progress to 60 are skin-able creatures. You will make a good portion of money leveling skinning + mining (or w/e else really). Shit without skinning you would still make enough gold to get your mount before 40, with proper planning. So there's no reason to not have it, especially if you're rushing to 60.
---
Remember that when OSRS came out, many players didn‚Äôt want there to be any changes, but the game only started gaining traction when some new content was released. 
---
I know right now it seems really foolish for blizz to add new content but after classic had been around for 2+ years, our minds might change.
---
What killed it anyways? I played for a month when it came out and was really liking it but then I just quit all games all together for a while that year and then when I started gaming again it was already dead.
---
naw, you didn't.
---
He looks bad ass honestly
---
10k total accounts? Or 10k people on at the same time? If it's the latter, then I don't think any private server has had those numbers since Nost.
---
How is Eternia this time of year? You capture Greyskull yet?
---
Heal your ally and spam smite on the horde.
---
I‚Äôm playing horde and I‚Äôll help out every horde in world PvP.
---
Just make use of your extra character slots and bank every single item that isn't grey. Use your name + a note after the name eg. Nomadmisc, Nomadmining, Nomadcloth, Nomadenchant, Nomadconsumes, etc. and bank every single thing you possibly can. You won't need the extra character slots for awhile and you can level stress free without worrying about if you're selling stuff you don't want to.

PvP for my main, PvE for the casual char ill play with my GF.

She had a hard time leveling in live, but knows I'm hyped for claaaic so is giving it a go. I'm not gonna deliberately make it harder for her!
---
10/10 watched again.
---
Hi, /u/luxembourgs
---
Your mum always misses me, long time, mmmmm.
---
Expand on closed off places like Uldum and Grim Batol, only \*not\* like how they were implemented in cata.
---
I‚Äôd almost forgotten how corny this was. 10/10 would cringe again.
---
 Not quite. There are addons that try to replicate the functionality of focus casting, but they rely on targeting by name. This generally works fine against players, but it becomes inconsistent when you're fighting multiple mobs with the same name, or you are facing a hunter who has named his pet the same as themself.
---
Over 50% of the worlds population have helicobacter in their stomachs. So fasting etc. can indeed trigger formation of a stomach ulcer. Sorry, this is not really the right scope for an extensive discussion.
---
No reason to create a vicious cycle by trying to be as extreme as the complaints conjured by the people you dislike though. If they complain, so what. I'm a firm believer that what we get, is what we get. Blizz isn't doing shit else afterward, in terms of majorly changing aspects of core gameplay, etc.
---
 If it's a toggle-able option, it shouldn't bother anyone; even if players whine that the newer models don't mesh.
---
I thought about this and I'd like them available from in game means as trophies for really convoluted stuff like the quests without many leads on where to go or what to gather with turn ins that are fuck rare. An example could be all holidays have a chance when completing something in the holiday to yield an item after all of them from the year are gathered you find a special quest item and turn it into someone really tough to find maybe they only spawn briefly rarely and move around the world. Do all that and you get rooster mount. Kinda like a vanillafied what a long strange trip it's been.
---
Yeah that would be cool if they were able to let people with the original codes re-use them.
---
It's funny. P-servers are considered "dead" at those Vanilla numbers.

no effort? play a warlock or hunter
---
iirc names that reference irl famous people aren't allowed under the ToS
---
If you want to play feral you'll probably have more success joining raids as an off tank and then going cat for when an off tank isn't needed.
---
It's possible to heal as shadow spec. You aren't nearly as efficient though, so the group has to wait for you to drink longer and more often.
---
On the relaunch of Nost PVE as Darrowshire I was shadow for the first few weeks starting raiding even and did ok on healing meters and was the top dispeller by a mile, but I was constantly drinking the moment combat dropped.
---
What‚Äôs an expac?
---
Blizzard made their game like other MMO's...when they already stood out from the crowd. Sad, really.
---
Add karazan as a sidestep to naxx. Gear equal but for specs that arent optimized due to gear restriction like ret paladin and moonkin. Hell even a book drop that teaches paladins a taunt would be a game changer. I'd like to see it reimagined from retail bosses and all though including the crypts. They were already planned anyway and gives the teleport of the legendary staff an actual function.
---
Loot funneling got a lot easier after vanilla because you could take people from three different tier tokens. Beyond that, you could try to have those three buyers be one str, one agi, and one int user to really maximize the potential for gear.
---
This doesn‚Äôt work as nicely for most of vanilla because you either bring a buyer of eagle class for tier gear, but they are all rolling on overlapping non-tier. It‚Äôs easier to just let them all come in and bid on each item.
---
Also it stops someone from going rogue and leaving with everything lol.
---
A very rare thing, but still a possibility. At least with guild banks it made blizzard's job easier for returning items in case an officer went rogue.
---
Shit about the bunnies made me laugh irrationally hard, and I dont know why.
---
Felt cute? Are you a 14 year old female vlogger or something?
---
We will endure my friend, 3-4 months to go. We are close
---
Ill pray for you my brother, my you find peace soon!
---
Is this satire? This has to be satire.
---
You'll need tailoring for Bloodvine set anyways, so you might as well have it. The set bonus requires tailoring for it to be active.
---
Who runs out of mana during trash? Guilds that are chain pulling one mob after the next with no break to drink and lots of constant movement to clear the raid quickly.
---
The mana use is on top of mana gem and mana potion, there's no reason to hate free mana.
---
Don't know if you're right but I sure hope so... I'm doing a tank-healer pair with a friend, and it'll reeally suck if we have to stand around waiting for DPS to show up.
---
I love when companies claim they don't have backups... it's so laughable. Same thing happened with OSRS. When people requested an old game, they claimed they didn't have backups.
---
Magically when a 2006 jagex-like private server was announced and like 100,000+ people signed up before it came out, Jagex was magically able to find the old code and launch their own older copy of the game.
---
Burn it down.

You‚Äôre*

A little raid of one boss like onyxia where we kill hooger's father
---
Crap. Ty
---
You're stupid.
---
I mentioned warlocks.
---
Yea you gotta admire this guys optimism.
---
As a realist I am just totally thrilled that when I get about 300 people ignored I will have weeded out the worst of the worst, rather than being endlessly assaulted with unending hordes of humanity.
---
Hunter on PvP realm. See lowbie. Command pet to stay. Walk out of Gadgetzan with lowbie targeted. Before going far enough to dismiss pet, command it to attack. Run like hell to get out of range of angry goblins. Good times.
---
That's because it's a blatant lie. Completed quests have been yellow question marks over the quest giver's head since launch.
---
Unless they're referring to the minimap, which it doesn't seem to.
---
also FP, which alliance did not have in vanilla
---
As definitelynotcasper mentioned, ony head is only part of world buffs. In high end gear the crit is just not as valuable, even without ony buff. All the other world buffs can be buffed on demand.
---
You reach a point where more crit doesn't dramatically increase your ignite uptime, so the value drops significantly.
---
I demand the un-redacted report.  Congress must act!
---
I‚Äôd love to see some new themed patches introduced. 
---
I‚Äôm particularly interested in the whole troll thing, and I found it a shame that there wasn‚Äôt more troll-themed lore or content after ZG. 
---
A return to STV a while after Naxx could be so cool, to like return to a now ransacked kingdom or something... idrk
---
No changes
---
It shall come to pass
---
You can play some no changes server and leave us some vanilla servers with new content
---
Ganna be honest, I chuckled.
---
The thing that always got me about the "wall of no" was that it was community made and then copy pasta'd by other players of the same community.
---
These white knights genuinely felt like they were representing blizzard and blizzards best interest.
---
Feels pretty damn good to know that it's blown up in their faces, and they must have felt a little sheepish when the classic announcement was made.
---
Thats weird here's my channel link:  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiTKrHuYBVHbVQ3ytbUf1RA?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiTKrHuYBVHbVQ3ytbUf1RA?view_as=subscriber)  you can check it out here =)
---
But it was in classic. That's my point. I see people say: '#nochanges... [except for this one thing I have a problem with]'. 
---
I'm not a strict #nochanges person but if we made every little change suggested on this subreddit we would end up with BFA all over again. Obviously this one doesn't impact gameplay so I'd be alright without it.
---
I hate lootboxes and the such; but, I understand that unless the game makes money for the devs, we will lose the game. So as long as they stay away from paid level boosting, name changes, and server transfers (things that effect the game) I'm fine with them making money on a function that was in vanilla.
---
Yeah,  but messing with raids trying to form was lots of fun from the aggressors point of view. Also, just making it into the instance felt like an accomplishment at times when you were outnumbered, and that itself also was fun.
---
The nochanges kids dislike anything with changes without even reading
---
When in humanities evolution do you think the eating plan centered around the convenient ‚Äú9-5‚Äù work schedule evolved?
---
Because it wasn't like that in Vanilla, so you shouldn't get any quality of life improvements.  Really that's all it comes down to.  They would rather have mobs die half way up a cliff without being able to loot them at all than to allow you to AOE loot.
---
It's a video game dude. Chill.
---
People are just hardcore #nochanges, and autoloot wasn't added until the TBC prepatch. If blizzard doesn't put it in, there will be an add-on for it in the first half hour of the servers going live.
---
Looking at the pserver community, the custom servers are ghost towns.
---
No, you can have your server with changes so you can play with the other 5 people that want changes and leave vanilla alone, thanks.
---
&gt; 2.3.2 01/08/2008

&gt; 
---
&gt; - Yellow question marks for completed quests on the quest givers instead of exclamation points
---
&gt; ‚Äã
---
&gt; I read through the whole thing, those are the only two features im going to miss from all the expansions. dangit.
---
Completed quests have been yellow question marks over the quest giver's head since launch.
---
people who like to *emerald* dream a little.
---
RIP [REDACTED], we'll put laptop in your coffin so you can play classic from beyond the grave
---
Yeah,
---
It existed already in vanilla, and then only real difference here is there is just an option for it so you dont have to press shift.
---
There are more important things that actually matter like sharding on launch day. Those people need to keep directing their attention at, not fucking trivial bs like not having to press shift to auto loot.
---
Auto looting was in vanilla.
---
Use an add-on or press shift.
---
Because custom servers are shit and not blizzmade so nobody cares
---
Oldschool runescape is pretty much the same and has been very succesful with new content.
---
Obviously there should be Classic servers without any changes, but optional servers with new content would be pretty nice after a few years of the same content
---
What‚Äôd they do to you?
---
That‚Äôs really odd then that I played a gnome warrior in vanilla.... not a private server, in vanilla.
---
Im joining you!
---
EDIT: i failed sry
---
To each their own, Hope you have fun doing it that way.
---
That's why I said class, not spec ;)
---
I used to swap it so it was shift to not full loot.
---
AOE looting is different; it puts all the loot from all the nearby corpses into a single window.
---
Don't compare AoE looting to auto-looting, that's two completely different things and obviously a vast majority would be against AoE looting in Classic.
---
not alot of people know about this, and even those wo do, just pretend like its okay cause its not rape if a girl forces a dude to do it
---
it use to be exclamation marks when completed
---
yeah but the point is, they do this with the classic reddit.
---
I ain't giving you no treefiddy you goddam Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddam money!
---
I've been in several guilds that has been running gdkp runs ever since Wrath, and I have no reason to believe it shouldn't be possible in classic as well. 
---
While modern gdkp runs often has buyers for more than gear (such as achievements, mounts or even just the final boss down), I'm sure there will be plenty interest in this kind of thing once guilds finish progression in any given phase. 
---
For the guilds I've been in, it's never been a gbank stocking thing, but rather a steady income for the raiders. I'm not sure I see a huge benefit of keeping the earnings for the guild, but maybe someone can shed light on that aspect.
---
Well no one cares if they're against autolooting, because it's from Vanilla.
---
Diehard #NoChanges idiots
---
Also, the PI/Weaving spec is just too much sacrifice for utility. You start not even being a good healer at that point. Pick one, PI or Weaving if you want to have utility, or go a pure healing spec.
---
PI is overrated, but it serves a function to allow a healer raid spot to contribute to dps while still being a strong healer. Weaving does the same, except you are a weaker healer and you can't raid buff Fortitude because you don't have it talented. You also lose mana regen while casting. Weaving spec is the stronger utility at the cost of healing power, while still being a decent healer.
---
PI/Weaving guts your healing completely, leaving renew and flash heal as your only spells that are similar in power/efficiency to priests with healing talents. Both of those spells are insufficient later in progression at the same point where casters benefit most from PI and Weaving.
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
My big complaint is that while the Horde has a major city hub on both continents, the Alliance don't feel like they have one in Kalimdor, because Darnassus is on an island in a remote corner of the map. The Orgrimmar/Undercity blimp connection makes travel for horde a piece of cake. Its simply better than SW/Theramore boats.
---
I got the Superman 2 reference. I'm not sure how I feel about that.
---
We have a right to remember how they behaved
---
Shut up Ricky!
---
1.12 had RP-PVP
---
6.14 feet (1.87m) and 128 pounds (58kg) here, I know that feel of not surviving for 2 days without food :'3
---
I've never been a Lore guy, but it would be dope if Chromie created this whole "alternate timeline" for people to go back to classic. and in this alternate timeline, something happens so that the dark portal was never opened. New alternate timeline could be based around Emerald Dream, Defias Brotherhood, or Scarlet Crusade. TBH, I've always liked the aesthetic of Azshara, so something around that is dope too
---
You can go out to any private server running the 1.12 client and it is questionmarks over their head. That's clientside art a private server would have no way to control.
---
Agreed on the circles for the minimap though.
---
No joke.  And everyone on this sub:  you don't need to be healer specced to heal, or tank specced to tank!
---
I don't have a guide, but this is my favorite mage pvp video I've ever seen. I got inspired to go Elemental early on. Foolish really, as you need good gear to be great with it, but god...it's probably my favorite spec in the entire game.

#UPDATE: THERE WILL BE NO UPDATE TODAY
---
i still remember to this day how i started wow as a human paladin, and them my buddy got hooked on that same crack and decided a druid he shall be, so i started leveling a hunter with him 
---
and because i had money i bought a couple of bags for us, not realizing that i had a quiver i had one extra bag. 
---
after some time questing we stumble upon another druid, he asks us were he can find bags and i handed him the spare one and directed him to darnassus for more. 
---
fast forward 20 levels and 2 weeks to redridge and we bump into the same druid again, he says "hey its you, thanks to your bag i could level my alchemy and farm herbs, i made some gold, here have sum" and hands me 10 gold. 
---
i also still remember countless interactions with the same horde rouges in STV. funtimes
