I hear ya man. Loved loved loved everything about leveling my shaman, but with an eye towards end game this time around I don‚Äôt think I can do it again. Worse than just being a heal bot I felt more like my purpose was exclusively totems and mana tide totem. Gonna have to play a pure dps this time around. 
---
---
---
Absolutely love your artwork dude! Would it be possible to get a 1080p export of your Delivery to the Sepulcher? Really would love it for a wallpaper!
---
Totally agree that 20/21 is all you need in resto. It really never turns shaman into an awesome healer. But I do think s lot of raids kinda expect the shamans to have mana tide. It‚Äôs kinda the best thing a shaman can do for a raid 
---
Lv30 Druid becomes the apex predator, literally incapable of losing fights.  It's only down hill from there.
---
My 13 year old and myself (35) are planning on duo leveling the entire time during classic.  We are strongly leaning toward a druid / shaman combo.  I think combo will be very effective while leveling, though I have a few questions.
---

---
	1) While leveling dungeons I feel we will be very flexible in finding groups, however I worry about still needing a dedicated healer.  I played an alliance druid at launch into the mid thirties and was turned down often as a healer and people didn‚Äôt believe in druid tank either back then.  I am hoping that a shaman/druid duo would be able to tank\heal all leveling content.
---
	2) What spec should the Shaman level  if playing with a druid the entire way thru.
---
	3) How effective is shaman/druid as a roaming duo in BG's, seems WSG should be good combo with Shaman, how about AB\AV and WPvP?
---
	4) What type of stat gear should we focus on for druid/shaman while leveling.  I imagine most pulls will begin with the druid moonfiring a series of mobs, casting a regrowth and entering Bear form to tank.  I anticipate the Shaman then dropping fire totems, spamming some AOE, melee'ing and tossing out heals when needed. If things get dicey the Shaman can drop grounding totem as the Druid peels off and heals himself and re-enters Bear.
---
Should we just roll a Shaman/Warrior?
---
If you are set on enchanting i suggest to look up the Timbermaw hold rep grind because if you are willing to do that early game you can make some gold from enchanting. For leveling though i suggest going skinning and mining or herb. Then dump what you want for the other non gathering professions in the end game. 
---
Would of been better to have Thor as that shaman unbreakable video
---
You mean that thing /r/2007scape was originally about? Yes, no one..
---
Fair enough, but I actually got the KT xbow, not bullshitting. There are maybe only 10-20 people in NA/Europe that got it. I was 3/8 cryptstalker, decent neck/trinkets and KT xbow and could 2 shot clothies and felt like a demigod. 
---
I also was terrible at min-maxing. I was a consistent and reliable raider but I hated farming and reading on forums, I was obsessed with world pvp mainly and dueling. I know hunters fall off a lot in AQ/Naxx but we have our moments and also we have a really fun gameplay compared to mage spamming fireball. 
---
My main goal is Post-Naxx world pvp, with KT xbow. Getting #1 on dps charts in Naxx is not my main goal. Maybe I will change my mind when Classic is out but I enjoy hunter raiding mechanics and hunters are the best solo world pvp class. 
---
My best friend and I started together but he went night elf and I went human so we didn‚Äôt see each other for the first ten levels or so. 
---
Human Dwarf isn‚Äôt quite so bad since you just need to take the deep run team basically. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to be honest, unless you‚Äôve got like a half hour head start on your friends.
---
What I would like to know is which healer scales best with gear like a Top 3 
---
I call the entire zone the starting zone. The small area you first spawn in and do from 1-6 I call the noob area. 
---
If you ever see yourself playing a shaman or paladin, that can be an easy decider.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It might be cool to go Alliance to have a really fresh experience in your case. 
---
I‚Äôve done that before. I REALLY don‚Äôt envy you lol. Is one of you rolling a Druid or something?
---
AND I KNOW IT'S MY TIME TO GO
---
Yeah I am. I did it before myself, you used to be able to hug the coast and just swim to westfall, but I think that was fixed in 1.12
---
Or just make any won gear from a need roll BoP.
---
Idk but I‚Äôm getting so horny for classic #noshame
---
You still don't understand . . .
---
You got fucked hard on NOST. Nost is NOT vanilla. Nost was extremely broken for melle and casters. Ofcourse you got fucked on that shitty server. For example, War Fury crit bug on Nost which they all abused, that alone was a massive dps increase for Warriors. The fact that Flasks and world buffs were incredibly easy to get on Nost. The cooldowns on flasks materials and world buff cooldown was a fraction of that of vanilla. This meant that melle and casters were always flasked and world buffed. I'm sure you know that flasks and world buffs are massive dps increases for melle/casters but don't help hunters that much. Another example . . raid bosses having 0 armor on Nost due to debuff stacking which was wrong or the made up boss resistances allowing casters a huge dps increase. 
---
All I am saying is that yes mages/warriors outscale hunters in AQ/Naxx but its not as dramatic as on Nost. You got fucked because War/Mage were doing 100-300% more damage than you on Nost. I played with some of the [best geared Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR1CsAXLCw) in NA during retail vanilla, two of them Rank 14 . . [on Patchwerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qndf5vMuvlc) Hulk beat me but only by 30-40%. 
---
One of my treasured early memories of Wow:  Chillin in TB on my druid..  might have been level 40-45, can't recall exactly.   A pally with an epic mount is doing circles around the pond while the guards chase.  He has a shit load of them in tow.  Eventually, I got an entangling roots off that *wasn't* resisted.  The guards dog-piled him and wrecked his ass.      
---
      
---
It still gives me a warm fuzzy feeling thinking about it.
---
In the context of sharding, there is no starter zones in WoW Classic. You see, adding sharding would create a bastardized version of a masterpiece, and would constitute a change to the original game, something that is not allowed to happen. Since sharding didn‚Äôt exist in 2006, the time frame that the re-release is supposed to emulate, it shouldn‚Äôt be in the Re-release of the game. The game is called ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft Classic,‚Äù not ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft Classic with features from the current crappy retail game,‚Äù after all. Any argument to the contrary is blasphemy, and should be met with execution by burning at the stake. No changes, thank you. 
---
Well the end game is Nightfall Shaman with Elemental Mastery. Is that enough? lol
---
Need the random stats items while leveling up
---
That was on Illidan a Normal PvP realm.
---
I remember questing in the salt flats on my human paladin around level 30 and thinking "gee, there sure are a lot of horde around here". Without fail as soon as I rendered for them almost every single one would beeline for me, I became the outlet for a lot of people's pent up aggression.
---
I went with the time is money approach. My main will be human rogue on PVP server so i got the diplomacy rep bonus and i wont be ganked as much because i can just stealth. I also plan on leveling a alt Night elf hunter along side because hunters are the fastest levelers and Shadowmeld. The main reason for 2 chars is so i can go Herbalism and Engineering on rogue and Minning and Alchemy on my hunter. I will also have a banker warrior with Blacksmithing and enchanting i might level down the road but that depends on what the future holds.
---
You need to leave combat to stealth.
---
Yeah but I dont want to pay to leave my dead realm 
---
Stupid fear, no, they always offered free transfers from dead realms to more populated ones.
---
Yeah, If they have the ability to freeze an entire raid for long enough to monologue before escaping, couldn't they have just killed the healers and wiped the raid?
---
The key difference between Druid and Shaman is that Druids tank. You can make your own groups when you tank. If illegitimate servers are any indication of what classic will look like, then I will have no trouble making my own groups and clearing through AQ40 as a Feral tank/DPS hybrid. (I haven't seen Naxx on one of those servers yet, but from what I've read it works well there too.)
---
As for PvP: Druids are flag runners in WSG, base defense in AB and boss tanks in AV - all essential roles. Druids are basically the PvP equivalent of being the main tank of a raid. Again, very easy to make your own groups when you play the most essential role.
---
Druid definitely isn't as sexy as a Shaman. Shaman can blow people up with a Lightning Bolt -&gt; Chain Lightning -&gt; Earth Shock combo in PvP, while Druid is more about control and survivability. But I think if I'm actually going to invest my time in playing a class at max level, then Druid is what I'm looking for.
---
Then don‚Äôt complain when it dies. 
---
If you're on this sub we've already got you, buddy.
---
there is a source, but don't know where.  but I  am sure some website shows the old tier set looks.  I have seen them not long ago .
---
üòÇ
---
Can't wait to see you in the game :D Always happy to have another feral druid. While it's true you won't be as good as pure classes like those two, at least not at tanking and raw DPS, a druids strength lies in their versatility and mobility. It's a lot of fun. 
---
Be what you guys want to be, no matter what it will be able to work one way or another. But I will say shaman warrior is a blast. In dungeons shammy heals and warrior tank so can group no problem. Outside of dungeons, just having the warrior rail bitches with windfurry is worth considering.
---
Most people want to identify with their character, not pretend they are a blue or green woman. 
---
Yes? The combat timer is ~6 sec. Blind is 8.
---
Have you PvPd on a rogue?
---
I agree. Also, my memory isn't perfect, weren't the follow-up zones also pvp flagged just like the starting zone? i.e. Elwynn &amp; Westfall, Durotar, Mulgore &amp; The Barrens, etc?
---
If so, starting zone likely means up to and including Loch Modan / Barrens / Silverpine / Darkshore. Or at least that's the only feasible explanation, since it's only really from there that the path starts to really split.
---
Emerald dragons patch  -&gt; AQ40 gate opening, that was the pinnacle of video gaming for me.    
---
That is really good advice and it also wakens up some memories again, so it really resonates and makes sense to me. Ty so much!
---
low population servers makes it harder to rank because of the player pool.
---
Sounds like you'll have your hands full. Always nice to see someone have it planned out in advance. 
---
And although you probably already know this, remember to tame a cat so it can prowl while you shadowmeld. I've run into the problem before where I think I'm hiding from an enemy only to realize my fully visible pet is showing exactly where I am.
---
I don't think that would work on any dragon boss , they had abilities preventing kiting (I think)
---
I would love a video like this for each class, that would be amazing! 
---
Especially mage :)
---
Good work!

There was a poll like 1 year ago with several thousand replies that showed pretty much a 50/50 split.

One of my fondest memories was leveling rogues with my friend and ganking a level 60 troll mage who was camping nessis when we were both level 39. He was god awful at pvp, so we ended up camping him until he called in some guildies.

[That, and this tune runs whenever you enter the character selection screen.](https://youtu.be/92f7hAdMdYk?t=16)

---
Dude, you‚Äôre overthinking it way too much. Just ask your brother what would feel best for him, there‚Äôs your answer. 
---
There is demand for every healing class, it‚Äôs a non-issue. Just go with your gut. 
---
They'll merge servers if that's ever a problem...
---
Tailoring yes, enchanting no would be my advice.  Use a gathering profession to make money and train enchanting later once you are lvl 60.  You can solo farm instances for all the materials or buy them from the AH, you must remember the final trainer is uldaman and you will want to only visit it once :D  I normally level with herbalism as you can get others to make you potions and sell any excess, I find skinning to slow down progress too much skinning everything you kill and herbalism is just as profitable, leather is not a good profit maker down the volumes of players taking it to make money.  I normally switch to enchanting very soon after 60, then spend maybe a week solo farming greens in instances and chests, which also helps build the mount fund as you go.
---
 My fear is being on a Streamer server ...
---
I sure hope Blizzard doesn't get greedy or stubborn with server merges.
---
I was pretty pissed off on my old dead realm that it wasn't merged after many, many months of being empty.   I didn't want to pay for a transfer, I wanted a goddamn merge.
---
Levelling is not going to be 'way' faster, you're probably talking something like a 1-3% advantage in speed at most in levelling time - it may end up being a few extra hours to hit 60. Dungeons/raids will be fairly similar. Shaman for wf is of course awesome, but so is pally with BoW for casters and ridiculous healing efficiency.    
---
    
---
For BGs I think if shamy/pally is going dedicated healbot pally will be much stronger. You can healbot on shaman but it's not recommended, the default pvp spec is ele/resto which is an offensive burst class just with backup heals. Pally with BoF/cleanse/bubble/plate is just on another level as a pvp support.
---
What addon tho?
---
Oh god. Sometimes I wish WoW was real.
---
He wants to be either a shaman or a paladin with little preference.  I'm just curious what others think.
---
Nope, I was stuck on a dead realm for years. They kept offering free realm transfers to the server, not away, but it never helped.
---
Joanna's guide is written for the hunter perspective. If you're following it closely once it starts getting to the point where he's soloing elite quests, you won't be able to keep up on XP.
---
I'll be picking Alliance. First char was Alliance, went Horde for years after. I can't wait to relive walking into Stormwind for the first time again. Also SW &lt;--&gt; IF tram is awesome.
---
Improved renew isn't useless. It's an _extremely_ mana efficient spell to downrank and also comes into heavy play on a few bosses like Vaelstraz. 
---
I'd definitely switch one point over to Holy Nova but no way in hell would Holy Reach ever be more useful.
---
Not sure but I'm guessing they probably fixed that with the new engine
---
You're going to resub just for deadmines? Or did that just seal the deal
---
What if my name gets pinched in that time?
---
Haven't seen a PvP specific poll.
---
This is the real fear. People say to avoid the streamer servers but I don't know how we're going to know to do that unless all streamers agree to announce what server they'll be playing on before hand.
---
Then you need to work on your originality!
---
This is ridiculous. Back in 2004 all the hardcore PvPers from previous MMO‚Äôs agreed to go on the first alphabetical PvP server. It ended up being Archimonde. 
---
what about faction imbalance? Isn't the server going to be full of fans on the streamers side?
---
They states wall jumping is dead which is great for wsg.
---
It's where you went after Teldrassil, but some would instead just go to Westfall for doing Deadmines since otherwise, the first dungeon you ever see is Blackfathom Deeps around 20-25.
---
The biggest barrier of entry getting to Westfall was if you couldn't catch a portal in Darnassus, you spent 30 minutes death-floppng across Wetlands until you got to Loch Modan.
---
But shamans and paladins are COMPLETELY different though, not to mention that it might be an easier choice if you ask him if he wants to be Horde or Alliance.
---
OR tell him that shamans are overpowered compared to every other healer in classic simply because you want WF totem as a warrior.
---
U want paladins more as a tank
---
"If you're not first, you're last!"
---
I can't agree with execution at the stake, but otherwise he's right. Let's just have a clusterfuck of a starter zone during launch, isn't that also a part of the vanilla WoW experience? Also the servers are not going to be pserver sized, I assume. 
---
Nope. As you know they will use the modern engine and with the modern engine comes the modern anti-cheat coding which includes the anti-wall jumping system they currently have in retail.
---
No wall jumping for us
---
If you can make 30g/h as a warrior(easily achievable), you effectively spend 3600-7200 gold to level a second character (5-10 days).
---
If you want an alt make one, don't feel pidgeonholed into it for gold however.
---
For what?
---
&gt; This is legit the cringiest video relating to WoW
---
Fuck you I thought that shit was awesome, right up there with Mr. T's Night Elf!
---
I'm a player and I care
---
There was one a few days ago.
---
Yeah, a week before if they give us the server names. I don't see why anyone would possibly be against this...
---
People just like being contrary
---
If you don't have a preference on faction and your brother doesn't care either way, flip a coin. Shaman will be faster and probably more fun to level up with and you don't have to worry about competing for every piece of gear. Paladin will be better for endgame PvP.
---
Depends on your outlook of it. If it‚Äôs a PvE server, who gives a shit.
---
If it‚Äôs a pvp server and youre on the opposite faction of the streamers, get ready to be murdered on sight. 
---
If it‚Äôs a pvp server and youre on the same faction, have fun with an open season of kill on sight with a faction advantage. 
---
I‚Äôm personally the type that enjoys PvP servers with a huge faction imbalance so that I may join the more populated faction. But I dont look for fair pvp fights, I look for unfair steamrolls. 
---
All depends the type of player you are. 
---
R/woosh

---
If they don‚Äôt stay in Vanilla, or at least leave some Vanilla servers in a matter of time before people want Vanilla again, and we will be back in the same position as we were before the Classic announcement. So I can‚Äôt imagine them abandoning Vanilla. :)
---
I remember wall jumping to the top of Ironforge bank and inside the Stormwind auction house. Fun times.
---
&gt;you can't have one or the other, you need to either have both, or have none.
---
Why? They are separate things completely. I'm not saying that cross-server BGs should be in the game or not. You clearly don't think your point is strong since you have to pair it up with LFR to make an argument. "Slippery slope" isn't a valid argument for everything, just discuss things for what they are.
---
I would much rather have a feral druid who wants to tank in the OT role, then a warrior only doing it for gear.
---
The people who have a brain will get ahead of
---
that mess pretty quickly anyway.
---
It put me over the top. What a wave of nostalgia that brought up.

pretty sure trolls on the other side will grief/gank as much as possible.

I dunno man, I think Shaman brings a lot to the table for leveling with a warrior: WF, a range pull cabability, instant cast mob tagging, water walking, ankh for wipes, etc. They complement the warrior's weaknesses really well.

I want to go Alliance but my current WoW guild wants to swing horde (Guild leader wants to roll shaman, which I find a bit confusing as he has always been a shaman since vanilla and I feel like you could pick something else for a fresh start after 14 years). Going to roll 2 different characters probably, Human Paladin and Orc Hunter.
---
When I started playing in Legion, first time since Wrath, I was so disappointed by the new SM!  It was bullshit!
---
I'm curious if two years down the line, there will be "challenge guilds" which deliberately raid with sub-optimal specs and classes.
---
The content we get at the last phase will be the end of it. There's not going to be anything new. After that, it's up to the players who love classic to make their own fun.
---
dude i did this and it was THE most rewarding shit ever. i cheated tho i was a paladin
---
what do you mean trolls?
---
If you think ganking and corpse camping is wrong I don't think you should play on a PvP server (depending what you mean by griefing). 
---
That sounded a lot like r/gatekeeping but i don't mean it like that, I'm just saying it will probably happen, and I don't think we should get too worked up about it.

She expressed interest but I'm going to quietly hope she forgets.  She would hate it.
---
PvE servers also do BGs, so that's the queues will be a problem, right? 
---
I agree though that it all depends on the type of player you are. I don't like the idea of being on the faction with more players cause I've always been all about rooting for the underdog, but still I would prefer a balanced server just because of my first point about bg queues.
---
Been working on a a guide for this, in the initial analysis there are far less Fedex quests for horde, also after running both factions explorations Horde seem to have a far tougher area and risk of aggro. Westfall is a dream, where as Silverpine and even the east side of Tirisfal is challenging.   
---
I'll continue to work at a route before trying to improve efficiency, but my early thoughts are I won't be able to cut the time down significantly. It's been fun to work on though.

Mana Tide is 1,160 mana every 5 minutes, which comes out to 19.3 MP5 if used on cooldown. Since Restorative Totems is a pre-req for Mana Tide Totem, we can add the two together and say that Mana Tide is worth 25 MP5 to everyone in the Shaman's group. 
---
For reference: Major Mana Potions are worth an average of 2,400 mana every 2 minutes (or 100 MP5) if used on cooldown.
---
Mana Tide is definitely not a must-have. If I'm a raid leader and I notice that my healers are running out of mana, then I'm going to make sure that all of the healers are using actually using max consumables before we start requiring the Shaman to spec into Mana Tide. I don't know exactly when raids reach that point, but it's definitely not before AQ40 comes out.

I mean maybe you're gifted with the power of foresight, but most of us aren't.

I'm sure blizzard will come up with some solution. However your comment is pretty ignorant.

Druids were gods in wrath. I played resto but would always run with another Druid when I got the chance. Best times. Wish feral dps scaled a little bit better in vanilla! But who knows, with new tools some overlooked items/rotations/skill sets may make it viable!
---
Pick a server with an "un-cool" or "un-edgy" sounding name. That's my plan. 
---
Silithus. I never stepped foot in there until BFA.
---
I almost wished they named the classes Theif, just so there'd be less spelling mistakes.
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure the world record on a pserver that is as legit as they can possibly make it is 5 days and 12 hours or something like that, done by a troll hunter.
---
Using a pserver with no dynamic respawn and blizzlike XP, I've done 114 hours as a paladin. 2 hours faster than 2006 record.
---
I honestly just forgot about it and remembered it when thinking about songs to listen to while playing Classic, will end up listening to it outside of WoW'ing for sure.
---
This is half right. But I‚Äôm thinking about more specific days in my upcoming classic adventure. Noob tanks in the starting dungeons before they get tore a new one. And STV questing. I might make a couple class to start to 25 just to see as many new tanks trying this out!!! Ugh it‚Äôs giving me chills right now. So exciting. 
---
(Im not against new people to classic wow btw I believe they will be the backbone to the success of it just going to be funny! That‚Äôs all) 
---
Chromie. New model in Classic.
---
Pandaren aren't an option in Classic.
---
uhm ok ¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø. I call them heroes but whatever.
---
&gt; I'm sure blizzard will come up with some solution.
---
They already have. It's a paid service.
---
Feuer Frei - Rammstein
---
how do you turn this on
---
I think it was called Kirk's fast cast. 
---
Worked by abusing the small lag between the client and the server, by stopping the cast in the client with not enough time for the server to get the signal before it calculated the spell going off.  Effectively making a 2.5 second cast only take 2.45 seconds
---
Signs of life - Every moves a picture.
---
Truthfully it's from some TBC vid on the lurker below. It got me rigid for arcane mages.
---
Now it gets me rigid for classic.
---
My question has always been: why are the people who are buying these things, not pursuing the given profession and crafting them themselves?
---
Didnt they offer a free one?
---
Engineering or laziness.
---
&gt; I'm writing because I think I speak for most of the casual community 
---
You don't, so stop.
---
Yup that was exactly it. Thanks 
---
Oh i guess he got me good then!
---
Completely agree with this. I'll go my separate ways from a friend when playing classic. He wants to play Alliance and i want Horde. I already made the swap once (We were horde and i left wow after wotlk, when I came back he was playing A, so I switched) but I can't stand being in the Alliance anymore, For the Horde!
---
"casual" is about reduced playtime, not about playing suboptimally.
---
OK Tai Lopez.
---
They are all good and can all make money in their own way. I usually go alchemy/herb I like hunting for the mythical black lotus. Fishing makes a lot of money also but is pretty boring to level. You could just pop on netflix and do both at the same time though.
---
A lot of druid flag carriers have no idea what they are doing. It kills me inside.
---
Only for characters in overpopulated servers to transfer to low-pop servers. So no free transfers if you're stuck in a dead server.
---
No, they did not. They offered free transfers from HIGH pop realms to dead ones, which never worked. I don't know where this myth came from. Why would they allow free transfers off of dead realms FURTHER killing said dead realms?
---
!remindme 5 months when this dumbass is proven wrong
---
I know a looooooooooot of people who are going with whatever the played right back at the beginning. I know some who are going with the thing that they think will be the 'OP' class.
---
In a happily strange turn of events, I find myself seeing more of the former than the latter.
---
Live to Win - Paul Stanley. Release date of Classic I'm fairly sure my friends and I are all going to LAN with that on repeat üòÇ
---
From high pop servers to the low pop ones... And it never worked because in an MMO people don't want to willingly play on ghost town servers. Not even competitive raid guilds want to raid on a server with no other competing raiding guilds.
---
I have decided to go either shaman(still deciding race, playing a female) or Human paladin, depends on who I can convince to play with me.
---
 I played dps in vanilla but have come to love support classes the older I get. 
---
You want to corpse camp but cry injustice if called a dick for it?
---
Threat is not an issue while leveling and doing dungeons though. Having a WF totem behind you at all times (along with other totems like str/agi, cleansing, tremor, tranq, etc etc) is a godlike feeling for warriors. 
---
Not to mention ancestral healing, mana tide totem, reincarnation and so on.
---
That makes plenty more sense lol 
---
Done.
---
HEY! I main a sneakystabber and I'll have you know that I'm a very good speler.
---
Survival hunter is about the most annoying thing to play against ever as a melee. Scatter shot, imp conc shot, entrapment, imp wing clip, deterrence and counter attack. You can pretty much give up on ever moving.
---
Do you truly feel that being forced to pay for something completely out of your control is acceptable? At best, we will have server mergers. 
---
Idk if you can make the change now but i would have made the professions be a choose 2 kind of question, not making it required.
---
That sentence implies that the pressure is on the group to not mistakes, nothing more. I'm not sure how it implies the healer is the one that makes mistakes, I think you're grasping at straws with that one.  
---
Once again, to reiterate my point, the nature of LBRS, in the situation I described, no matter how fucking good your group is or how competent your dps/tank/healer/whoever is, shit happens.  Pats show up.  CC can get resisted.  Pulls can get messed up.  
---
I'm not sure what you're bent out of shape about.  The thread title discusses people who think Vanilla is easy.  I commented with a certain dungeon scenario with a certain class that's suboptimal, and thus, not easy.  You seem to have misconstrued it as an insult to an entire class and taken it personally, for reasons I don't really understand.  To be honest I feel like I'm talking to a wall at this point.
---
It had a low pop because everyone chose to focus on heavily populated servers. In a perfect world absolutely nothing would be shared about server population and you wouldn't be able tonight that information anywhere. 
---
Shit you got me
---
judging by this thread and the conflicting replies classic is going to be very decisive no matter how they do it, i can't wait
---
I didn't have to fight over mobs leveling my first character at release, I would have to do that now, though.
---
Sharding 1-10 is fine. 1-20 would be ok too. Anything past 20 is 100% not ok.
---
People shaming you and making fun of you for asking for help is actually pretty unlikely. They may ask you to get on voice chat. Might tell you to go download an AddOn, or they may replace you in favor of finding someone with more experience.  I wouldn't expect even the players who's first rodeo was BFA to go out of their way and snipe at you though.
---
Even on live WoW with BFA I find it rarely happens. What's way, way more common, is people shaming you if you go forward as though you know what you're doing and DON'T ask for help. If you let WoW players think you know what you're supposed to do, and then still manage to mess it up, they will relentlessly hound you for it.
---
No, people can call me whatever they want if I corpse camp them and I won't cry injustice for that. I never said I do such activity, but I think it's something that you should expect to happen if you play on a PvP server.
---
Engineering/Alchemy/Enchanting and 3 gathering professions exist. Many people dont wanna be stuck with blacksmithing or leatherworking and it's not exactly cost effective to lvl to 300, craft pre bis items, then drop it for something else.
---
I think the power creep and the fact that expansions gimped old content is what killed WoW for many. The balance issues were insane. If the power creep is controlled by no increase in level cap and careful tuning of new content, I think it could be massively successful.
---
LOL what a coincidences i just listen to that song before i got the update on your post 
---
Fuck pallies, shaman all the way yo
---
Lok‚ÄôTar Ogar 
---
This song helps me get out to jog everyday lol
---
Of course it's to be expected, doesn't stop it from being trollish behavior though.
---
And i prefer pvp servers where the horde outnumber alliance by a minimum of 3:1. 
---
Really drives home the fantasy of the savage hordes ravaging the pathetic alliance
---
Fair warning; it's not like your typical war movie (saving Private Ryan, apocalypse now, platoon, etc), people say it has made them feel uneasy and sick. Or weren't able to finish it because it was too much for them.
---
It's a very interesting read about how it got made also, if you're into that sort of thing.
---
I think even if you got top 1k guilds you'd have issues with having 40 people not fuck around though. But that's not really about boss mechanics
---
The funniest part of vanilla raids was when an alliance raid would freak out in disgust over a peice of elemental shaman gear, or plate with int/spirit for horde. Cracked me up every time!  
---
(I seem to remember my alliance guildmaster submitting a GM ticket complaining about ele shaman gear dropping on our first three kills in MC).
---
&gt;  Stop parsing the issues.
---
I am not sure "parsing" means what you think it means.
---
&gt; Just no loot trading. How hard is it to understand?
---
The problem here is not that people don't understand your opinion. It is that repeating your opinion over and over again is not an argument and is not participating in an intelligent discussion.
---
&gt; "Like I said" no, you fucking didn't saying anything of the sort.
---
I have made a few posts in this thread. I was saying fifteen hours ago that (a) I can see how it is a possible issue in an UBRS pug but (b) I struggle to see how it will come up often in 5-toon runs at level sixty because cases where 3+ people can legitimately roll on one item will be rare and only come up with weird and suboptimal party compositions.
---
Serious answer is that there's too much information not available, both in the context of the question, and in regards to classic's implementation to certain one way or the other.
---
Personal opinion is that 1.12 is not the starting point most of those classes had in vanilla, and a lot of stuff that held some of those classes back isn't there anymore. (itemization is the big elephant in the room)
---
I'd lean towards saying that if we rated classes with 1-10 scores for each individual category of pvp and pve (BGs, Ganking, Dungeons, Raids, Questing) Warriors would probably have the highest consolidated average score.
---
Doesn't mean they're the best at everything. But they're generally not THAT terrible at anything, they're the best at a few things, and at LEAST middle of the pack in most categories.
---
So if we're rating classes the way we're rating Cars, I'd say Warrior.
---
Orly
---
Omg grow up if your stuck pay up and/or shut up about it lol
---
Yes dude that is completely acceptable 
---
r/lewronggeneration
---
They also mentioned that though
---
Raery 
---
As I see it, this can **only** be an issue if *at least* three toons in the run can legitimately roll on an item. In a five toon run this just is not going to come up that often.
---
I can think of maybe one or two examples, like [Mindtap Talisman](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18371#comments) which potentially two caster DPS and a healer might want, or even the tank too if you have a druid tank who is trying to gear up to heal. And they might all want two copies of it so even if they have one equipped they could still roll on another without being outed as a ninja looter. But it seems like 90% of the time or more nothing that can possibly drop will be BiS for three different people in the same group unless you have a weird group like three rogues, a tank who wants to be DPS and a healer who wants to be DPS. In which case you're making your own problem.
---
1) You will have to sacrifice ideal for attainable. It's not realistic to expect 40 attentive, informed, skilled, geared raiders. Absolutely have flexibility in player over class.  
---
2) It's easy to underestimate the human element, but being too rigid can make raiding less fun, which leaves vital members vulnerable to poaching/quitting. It's not very quantifiable, but be careful about rejecting someone that fits the group for someone that fits the comp.  
---
3) A lot can change between now &amp; naxx. Until naxx is nearby, you can compromise on tanks. (Oh, and if a feral is tanking naxx, they need lots of +hit, which sacrifices other stats)  
---
4) Again, the player is essential. Even beyond skill. Ferals are decent, but not every recruit will keep farming those crowd pummelers for you. Hunters work, but will they keep churning out thorium shells? Just as classes have a skill floor/ceiling, there's also a class preparation floor/ceiling
---
Those aside, the composition. 
---
1) Have you considered having someone (usually an enh shaman) going nightfallen axe? (drops to 11 healers)  
---
2) It is a bit heavy on healers, especially if your raid is taking things seriously. I'd drop a priest. (drops to 10 healers)  
---
3) For phase 1, I think the numbers aren't really with warlocks. Shadow weaving won't pay off until later afaik.  
---
4) Your spec/class distinction is a bit meaningless for some classes. Mages? They'll all be frostbolting through BWL. And competing HEAVILY with those locks for gear, since low-tier mage gear kind of blows. Don't get me wrong, the ratio is still fine - my point is that different "specs" often won't expedite gearing up
---
At least you didn't develop *other* illnesses from all those rogues doing you from behind. :V

---
Hey gang!
---
Looking for a leveling buddy on an oceanic PVP realm.
---
Planning on rolling troll priest so ideally looking for somebody rolling warrior or maybe mage/warlock
---
Taking the first 2 weeks of launch off but I'm not an ultra neck beard. Hoping to play 6-8 hours per day in that first 2 weeks, maybe more, depends!
---
 Goals and priorities will be getting to max level, farming enough gold for mounts/profs/enchants while getting a healing set together and an off spec pvp set going as well. 
---
Overall goals are (but not limited to) 
---
Pvp rank 10 (minimum)
---
Epic mount
---
Finding a quality guild 
---
Clearing raid content while it's still current
---
Having fun out in the world!
---
So if your in aus/nz, rolling horde and looking for a healer buddy hit me up via comment or PM 
---
Auctioneer / enhtooltip.
---
I guess its matter of taste, i prefer. Dispells and blessings over shamans. Atleast when im tanking or pvping 
---
All you have to do is swim to IF from menethil and drown close enough, then since lower than lvl 10 just rez at IF with no sickness
---
Literally read the comment history of the person to whom I referred you autist 
---
I'm cursed with principle.  It wasn't about the money, it was the fact they wanted me to pay instead of them just doing the right thing.
---
So I chose to cancel my account and give them nothing.
---
You can do pvp and dungeons even in greens, as long as you do your job well (sheeps, cs etc). You can even do MC/ZG without much problem. (some FR gear might be helpful in MC though).
---
However you won't do that well in raids after MC (by well = dps) if you just have general blues. Even as a mage you need to have pre-raid BiS gear (e.g. bloodvine set) to be competent there. Still this can let you jump straight to BWL/AQ40 without doing MC and have decent dps if you just have BiS blues.
---
It's a contested zone (obviously) and there are a lot of quests in STV.  In my opinion, it's one of the best looking zones, if not the best.  The layout/topology make for some exciting times as well - you never know who you might run into in the jungle.  The look and feel of STV, coupled with the thrill of PvP is why I quest there.
---
STV is, without a doubt, my favorite zone in all of WoW.
---
Female humans have had notoriously big weapons too.
---
Do, all of durotar, then
---
Any sharding beyond the first zone is really ridiculous. I‚Äôm gonna hit level 20+ without sharing the world with my server mates? This is the slippery slope. Just stop. If you don‚Äôt want to fight over mobs, just wait a few days. That would be the unselfish thing to do. Instead you want to play immediately at server launch on your terms. Selfish. 
---
Easily my favourite zone, I intend to bring my Dwarf there ASAP. It's the perfect mix of relaxing and creepy.
---
If you are 16 and played vanilla when you were 4 that would have been 2007 and burning crusade came out in January 2007
---
Yea I gathered that after watching the intro. It was really interesting. Going to wait until the wife and kids are asleep and see how it goes.  
---
AV
---
Pfft he didn‚Äôt have bubble hearth up?  What a complete nonpaldin 
---
Not to mention there is less competition for gear between the two as they are different armor classes
---
Its pretty easy to script though

---
&gt;there is absolutely nothing wrong with loot trading
---
K I laughed. No point in even arguing with someone like you
---
what you want is classes who can use their tier gear and have low loot competition
---
Druid and Hunter are top of the list imo. If you‚Äôre alliance and some hunter mail drops you should get it a lot of the time. Also you actually use your tier sets, and there won‚Äôt be more than 2-3 hunters usually.
---
Druid is a similar deal. Decent tier gear, minimal competition. There‚Äôs a weirdly high amount of Druid leather in the game too. Makes big raid nights fun to get tier drop after tier drop anyway.
---
Arguably warlock too here but you have direct competition for most gear in a way those other classes don‚Äôt. 
---
Warrior can be good for tanking their way to prebis for reasons others have stated, however. If you‚Äôre a fury warrior in a raiding environment, you can‚Äôt roll on any piece of tier gear unless none of the tanks want it, and you do an OS roll against all the other fury warriors. Basically you‚Äôre not gonna see any until the hunters already have a full set.
---
You also have high competition for all kinds of gear, and well itemised pieces are scarce for the first tier or two.
---
**If you‚Äôre prot, of course, this isn‚Äôt a problem.** Prot warriors should easily have the fastest gearing time, due to ease of grouping, limited competition, and relative abundance of tank gear in loot tables.
---
they COULD roll need on "bind on equip" items of any type, the game you want is retail.

As a fresh 60 with no mp5 you could have mana issues in bad 5 man groups. In raids you will mostly be raid healing or assigned to assist on an offtank, lots of chain healing and focusing on totem placement. If given the choice I think most smart guilds will stack Rshams with a few priests and one Rdruid so raid spots will be easy to find.
---
I don't remember this. Can you describe how to get there so I can check it out when I get to work?

Ackchyually if he is 16 now that means that 12 years ago he was 4 therefore 4 in March 2007. If you say that TBC came out in January that means that he could have been 4 yo for most of 2006 (depending on when his bday is) so there you have it.
---
I don't think that's the point though. Maybe it was TBC he played. The sentiment is the same. Why are people always trying to find the lier?
---
Nothing is out of your control. You are not forced to play on a specific server. If your current server has too low of a popuation for your tastes, you can easily create a character on a different server --- FOR FREE.
---
Insta poison was a penicillin based. 
---
By strategy he means friends/guild mates will come into a dungeon together, unequipping their pre raid BIS gear to make it look like they need it, then they both roll and have a higher chance winning just to give to their friend. So he isn't wrong!
---

The worst is when you accidentally pull adds with him and the adds kill you during that 10 second stun.

---
All the way to 110 in WoD is like getting to level 30 in Vanilla.
---
Engineering is a truly game-changing prof. It's mandatory for competitive pvp and pve. 
---
Level 30 stuff isn't really worth anything until people have hit 60, bought their epic mounts, bought their pre-raid gear, enchanted all of it, and have started making alts. That could take 6 months.
---
Chances are, if you're reading this forum: you're playing at launch. Just wear that shit.
---
your life must be struggle bus, living off principle. I get the whole point but damn bud.
---
The furbolg costume item for alliance is pretty cool.
---
oh yeah, you're totally right! we did do this. holy damn, it's been forever.
---
I just want to be able to move my characters up and down on the select screen. Drives me crazy when they are not in level order. 
---
The moment you invest Blizzard will leave Activision. Lol. Maybe you should.
---
I will preface by saying I've never played any raid content in vanilla.
---
What i look forward the most in classic is being a druid. I will play feral mainly (love healing so will do that when necessary but I want to focus on feral) so being able to switch between dps and tank really appeals to me. I also love that I will have the ability to Innervate the oom priest (or whoever gets it), battle ress in an emergency and being able to decurse when needed.
---
you didn't but I remember watching this back in the day
---
do you really want to be wary of guild mates joining the group together? because if they both are melee, spellcasters you will never know. they will have unequipped their items before joining the group
---
If I do play, probably Dwarf Hunter.  That's what I rolled in the Beta back in November 2004.  I had no idea what I was doing at the time, and I haven't played that race or class since.
---
I like the idea of being able to ranged pull, having the versatility of a pet to off-tank, solo survivability, and ability to avoid repair bills on a lot of raid bosses.  Having played a Mage before, I like the simplicity and maneuverability of a ranged DPS rotation.
---
On the other hand, I'm considering Druid or Warrior.  Druid is more versatile role-wise, and probably more fun when solo.  Warrior would probably be the best for getting 5-man groups and battlegrounds, but I don't know if I can handle the pressure of tanking, and their gameplay is harder.  And I've already played those classes a little bit in the past.

Mage easily has the most specs that all function in pvp and can still work well enough in the easier raids. When I first hit 60 I wasn't very geared and rogues/hunters were more trouble. 
---
I was deep frost elemental - This was close to it, I just remember wasting points on the fireblast cooldown and having the reduced fireball cast time to combat paladin aura dancing. I never could give up piercing ice even though it's terrible for pvp, I just wanted the biggest numbers. It did make fighting melee/hunter/feral easier with the cooldown and crits.

Just one question though is poor&gt;weak or the other way around? 
---
The rule is if it's red it's dead.  Leave if you don't want to be camped.
---
Don't forget the mass piles of dead bears and cats.
---
Can't wait to see how the BGs turn out. I've played with two Druid players who have played flag runner on private servers for years and it's really impressive to watch someone who can consistently pull off those jumps damn near every time even when under pressure.
---
But it's also something that was never intended and it's probably a good thing for the game that those jumps get removed, even though I think it's sad that it also removes a skill aspect of the game. But it really is for the greater good of the game.

That is really good advice and the first part is in line with the other long post so I will take that to heart. I mean the draft I posted above should just help me to guide a little in which direction the composition *should* go. But in the end it is more effective, realistic even and certainly more fun to react to and with my teammates than to follow a rigid plan.
---
I was possibly too afraid to drop healers, especially priests. Again I only saw a part of BWL and then we already went on to TBC, where I raided deep but it was vastly different from vanilla. I also don't remember how many of which role we brought. I mean who does really. So good tip there.
---
As for Enh shaman I read up on that. I have basically 0 exp with them. I read that they don't really make up for their loss of personal damage, but a dedicated Nightfall wielder would possibly make for a positive net gain. I assume through flurry it is possible to keep the debuff up as a single Enh and the second Prot can then wield Anihilator if he isn't tanking? These things are actually not my direct concern but indirectly I kind of need to know if an Enh shaman is really a general net gain. I could imagine putting one in the main-tank group to push higher threat.
---
Another thing I considered are Ele/Resto Shamans because the melee groups don't need manatide. But there is so little information about them and I never saw one in a raid until TBC. Some people claim that they are strong after AQ and into Naxx because of gearing (-nature resistance). It is hard to even find gearing lists. I'am cautious about this.
---
I was level 55 when my RL friend's guild was trying to do Azuregos.. it was a newerish server so they were the first guild trying to kill it on the server.  I wasn't a high enough level to get into the raid but I stood off to the side in what we call the triage area.  I sat there and bandaged people who were low.. they would run over to me get bandaged up then sent back into the fight, lol.  It was over 30 minutes of fighting and the healers were all out of mana.  Nobody had any gear, lol.

The fastest 1-60 on private servers that I'm aware of is 3d 9hr, set by Varrak. He has a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWyBu0c7zX8-WRai0GruvUg/videos) showcasing the entire route.
---
I don't think it's possible to achieve 3 days on Classic but we'll see. Never underestimate nerds.
---
&gt; If Classic doesn't work out, I'm sure some people responsible for this project will be penalized, if not fired. 
---
That's... not really how it works, unless the programmers fail the project somehow, which you can't really fail with programming unless it's neglect, and the decision makers would point fingers at the community, and you can't really fire people who aren't actually in the company.

Why? I was planning on joiner a streamer server because they said they would do world pvp events and more.

Definitely blue. At the time, pink worked, and it would work again, but blue has been tied to the shaman class since BC (across multiple formats including hearthstone).  Why the fuck do I care about this?

Sigh* The more I think about it, the more I'm coming to share this sentiment.  I absolutely adored my shaman while leveling up, but I also had a lackluster time at 60.  I had fun while pvping at 60, but there is so much more than that to look forward to end game.  I'm starting to feel I can't do it either.  The amount of time and effort I'm going to invest in my main makes me really feel I'll have to appreciate my end game raiding role. 
---
I cant wait to see this subreddit when (just like early wow days) you have to pay money on top of a sub to get off of a dead realm, because the only free xfers are from HIGH pop realms to LOW pop realms.
---
People are going to rage after being asked to pay. 
---
Deciding faction ahead of time should already be done.
---
It won't, and literally nobody in the world is as disappointed as I am. There are so many places me and my exploring friends left half-finished.
---
Gotta also think of times when a lot of mana is needed at once.  Then Mana Tide is extremely valuable, much more than just "19.3 MP5 on cooldown" if you get what I'm saying.  I say this as a big proponent of 30/0/21 shamans; currently in a 3-way split between maining mage, warlock, and shaman.
---
Yeah but those who play on a realm that didn't wind up dead didn't have to pay to have their character there. They just lucked out when they first created their char. You shouldn't have to pay more to be able to play the game the same way.

---
With loot trading implimented people will be complaining on reddit that they pug they joined stole there loot and reddit will have a no name and shame policy, so you cant put them on blast. 
---
 So you will rant and rave in trade chat that xpwnsu and his guild are ninja looters, but few will take heed and even bad mouth you for clogging up trade chat until a tonne of level 60s have been ninja'd by the same guild and actually realise it (you can be descrete ninjaing with this system) that anything will happen and even then people will still join there MC runs weekly and get scammed without realising it. 
---
We used to in wrath run GDKP runs and just not pay out the gold at the end. 
---
We did this every second week and sure enough we would get a full roster half or less being our own guildies and everytime we would just run away with the money (not that i saw much of it). 
---
I feel like people say the community will take care of it. In reality they will just deal with those that can form the groups and complete the content it wont matter if they are scumbags or not. 
---
Just my two cents. 
---
PS. If loot trading is in ill probably try and ninja loot where i can for me and my friends. It will change the way i play to where ill only group where me and my friends are in the majority. 
---
Wonderful, thank you for sharing. New journeys to start with Classic coming out. I'm beyond excited.
---
Rogues percentage is so low from what I expected
---
Holy shit I just looked this item up.  Somehow never heard of/remembered it! If I was a raiding shaman and that dropped, idk how you could keep me from switching enh and giving it a shot
---
I don't want thousands of streamer ballwashers ruining the Classic experience and heavily skewing one factions popularity.
---
Perfect time to level up that bows/guns weapon skill.
---
Fjord Mustang.
---
There was a lot more to it as with most decisions.  I was a vapid alt-aholic with their professions feeding off each other.  It was my 'team' of characters I'd have to move so it'd be a pretty decent chunk of change.     
---
This was back mid-cata after the massive nerf to the game so I was already pissed.   Combined with all my friends had either quit or moved to various different servers.
---
To be honest it was messing my personal life up as well so I suppose 'principle' was a good excuse to get out.  Sounded much better than "i'm a fucking mmorpg addict" lol.
---
HEY ITS YA BOI, ASMOGOLD! 
---
Loot trading is fine you casuals. Find a guild. Loot trading will make handing out gear during raids more efficient for speed clears. 
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing a guild invite pop up on my screen. I‚Äôm planning on finding my guild organically within the game, so it‚Äôll be a big moment.
---
You know what I like more than materialistic things?  
---
GOBLINS!
---
I always have room in my bank for things like the Zul Farrak mallet, if only for helping lower level players during walkthroughs.
---
Un'goro, Shimmering flats, Hinterlands, and my fav place to hit 60 is the owlbeasts cave in Winterspring!
---
Don't forget the riding to gloves enchant to go with that carrot on a stick. 
---
What, no murlocs?
---
This brochure lied to me!
---
Ya'll are getting my paranoid. In actual Vanilla (where I was mega-ultra casual), I just vendored shit that I out leveled. 
---
In Classic, I'm 100% sure my bank is going to be flooded with any and all on-use item just in case its useful somewhere. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/
---
As long as there are less than 50 realms you can snag it on every one. Otherwise... second account.  Have fun in the queues!
---
I mean anyone can go NE if they want, picking a racial ability over looks isn't sustainable for most players imo. I loved playing priest/druid NE back in the day. 
---
Murlocs are everywhere! Something's always goes missing
---
1. Warlocks are very gear-dependent, yo
---
https://classicdb.ch/ is the best one as far as I can tell
---
Clearly Blizzard doesn‚Äôt care what *you* think lmao
---
Jokes aside, I wont have any audio interruptions on launch.  
---
After I rush on to make my initial characters, I plan to watch the cinematic from the game menu before I begin playing. And then from there the first 16 hours will be game music only.  
---
I too am very interested in seeing just how much more difficult WSG will become.  
---
I decided on huntard but was also considering warlock (not sure on race).
---
The deciding factor was my friends and group comp. We already have 2 clothies (kind of 3 if you include the hpal), are kinda heavy-set on melee, and slightly limited on CC abilities. So I chose huntard to fill in the gaps. I can also kite if needed and tranq shot since we have none.
---
As it should be.  
---
Pal =/= sham for healing roles. My take on it is shaman CH make them more like priests with aoe heals while hpal &amp; resto druid are ST snipers (excluding tranq). 
---
Arcane. It makes Frost like 30% better, amazing DPS boost.
---
/who only have 50 ppl as a result in vanilla, only on private can you get full population. A substitute I used was /who class 60 and add all the classes together, this gave a rough estimate of the realms pop, ofcourse this would have an upper cap if there's more than 50ppl of a certain class online.
---
They could put it in the Blizzard Vault or something and introduce new classic servers down the road. All the hard work will have already been done and I expect they'll keep a firm grip on any patch data they have access to so they won't have to redo all the work again.
---
I'm so pumped
---
#nochanges
---
I see powershifting in your future
---
It makes sense to keep track of all the statistic and achievement data even if it's never presented to the player.
---
not sure if you're really asking, but here http://www.mediafire.com/file/cru53er8wzhkql8/009+Sound+System+-+Dreamscape.flac
---
As a rogue I look forward to sharing loot with my hunter friend
---
Right now I'm leaning hard towards ret. Min/maxed with engi. Nightfall bitch if need be! I was looking hard at Spriest but my wife is playing warlock and I dont need the gear fights
---
Well those are statistics.
---
I've been using classic DB but some links are missing and broken so you can see the gear but not wear it drops always.
---
They also did low pop merges... pretty sure that happened a few times... but I have been playing a while and may have my xpacks crossed. 
---
Reliable data is hard to come by. Discords might be better than this sub
---
[This one source says the debuff will have about 17% uptime (20% with flurry)](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19169#comments:id=1363), equivalent to a 2.55 (3%) spell damage boost, or about 25% (30%) of another mage. You can dedicate a prot warrior to this axe when possible, but 1) if the offtank is needed elsewhere, bye bye buff &amp; 2) this gimps the offtank's threat in case the MT dies. I don't have an estimate for how much +threat the Improved Windfury gives to your tank, let alone actual enh dps in itself.
---
For the human element, the nightfall shaman is usually easier to keep happy (even if they dont get priority on gear), and easier to recruit if they drop, 
---
Seems like for a lot of the epics listed without where it drops from, are from rag or nef.
---
Real tears are running down my face. This is the one.
---
100% agreed, if you want to watch just one movie that really captures the soul-crushing reality of war, this is the one.
---
If streamers are smart they will all play paladins so they can bubble hearth 
---
I've been doing mostly pre raid BIS stuff for myself, wife and 2 buddy's. So havnt really checked out many epics. 
---
Just introducing new trinkets and set bonuses could go a long way towards making new viable specs.
---
Looking forward to those full day AV games!
---
Finally some OC my non-ever-60-warrior-but-now-eventually-60-warrior-ass can relate too 
---
Too lazy to level paladin? Probably the laziest class to level... You turn on your seal and whatever you want on Netflix, right click on mobs, holy light every 2-3 pulls. 
---
That‚Äôs paladin 1-60. You‚Äôll never go oom, you‚Äôll never die. Just slow and steady. 
---
No Changes omg I‚Äôm done 
---
Too bad we won‚Äôt be seeing much of any 2h Warriors. A warrior in full Valor with an Arcanite Reaper is a thing of the past, my friends.
---
wanna sell it?

I mean I still want be able to play it on 60

None of the old addons will work. The game is essentially running on a completely different engine.

It‚Äôs really strong. Idk if I‚Äôd call it a MUST but it‚Äôs the best utility racial a priest can have. I‚Äôd hit level 5 and then run to elwyn
---
You can hit ony with special melee attacks from underneath anyway. Just need to find a way to build some rage
---
Well, if you‚Äôre gonna heal its *the* best class for topping the heal charts, and every guild should bring 5-6 paladins so you‚Äôll definitely ‚Äúbe able to play‚Äù. 
---
It sucks though. Literally two buttons with FoL+cleanse. 
---
I‚Äôm taking my vacation when Classic comes out. I hope to be 60 at the end of the 9 days. 
---
I've never been to Azshara except to grab the flightpath and it seems like a cool zone. I often see people talking about how bad it is, though. I'm a sucker for crumbling old architecture and that, and seaside locations. Look forward to checking it out.
---
EsfandTV's (classic wow streamer) discord is always filled with people talking about classic.
---

I didn‚Äôt play classic, so for me I can‚Äôt wait to have to make a group and actually GO to a dungeon to beat it

Always played alliance, this time I‚Äôm going horde

Some private servers have databases like wowhead that you could use.

I support you OP. Even if they don't!

Wall Jumping was patched out about a year before TBC hit.
---
Shhh, do not reveal the sacred texts.

I tried looking for this a few months ago. Searched many databases but never found it.
---
Well to be fair, the longer we go with out official date, the more likely its a late one. 
---
Yeah, I mean compared to dps classes healing with pala sucks. 
---
Ash...cam
---
I like swim speed and water breathing potions. Invisibility potions can also be helpful in a pinch.
---
Binds to mouse scroll and starts scrolling away
---
An imbalanced PvE server means the downside of high pop (competition for world resources) without the upside (larger community to group with)
---
I‚Äôve tried several times to get this going, but I‚Äôll try again.  
---
Go A for Alliance.  If you want to roll Alliance, pick the alphabetically first name of your server type.  If we can get critical mass, we will ensure a populated raiding scene.
---
In a raid (which is what we're discussing), it absolutely makes sense to average out the mana. The only time where you would ever need a lot of mana at once is when you mis-manage your mana. That doesn't really happen in raids because the best way to raid heal is by spamming your most efficient heal: Rank 1 Chain Heal.
---
Priests are the ones spot-healing people when things go wrong. They should be getting Innervates from the Druids when that happens.
---
I may have never won as survival/BM, but I never lost.
---
The ecstasy of gold
---
I really don't know how streamers expect to play the game at all. Without sharding/phasing, they're going to have 40+ people constantly following them tagging mobs and lagging the zone. 
---
Oh man, wanding onyxia as a holy priest back in the day with those BWL wands was amazing.  Throw out some renews and auto wand ftw!
---
If you're not first you're last
---
Spend tons of resources &amp; time getting the skill and pattern to craft it... or just farm a bit and buy it?

RIP
---
By your ‚Äúfelt‚Äù rules, then, I‚Äôll have my say. I played Vanilla for nearly its entirety, and every expac until BFA. While I greatly respect much of the private server scene, I have only played on one to level 10.
---
I made this post because I care about Vanilla WoW, the greatest game ever made. There are many Vanilla-friendly reasons to disparage loot trading. There are zero Vanilla-friendly reasons to include it. Blizzard stands to gain the most from its implementation, hence why I‚Äôm raising my voice to remind them that such a tempting choice would disappoint the majority of their core community.
---
Is mining a good other option? I dont want to have to buy all the mats.

You need the gear to kill gnome rogues and throw their bodies over the alliance walls.

31/0/20 (holy/Ret) paladin. Or it might have been 33/0/18, don‚Äôt remember. I used this spec for raiding, pvp, 5mans as healer, dps and tank. I could flex to whatever role was needed pretty easily. Not top tier dps, but put me in strath or scholo and I‚Äôd keep up. Having 4+ sets of gear was fun
---
LBRS is probably my favorite WoW dungeon of all time, but  yeah it doesn't fuck around.

Also home to Gurubashi Arena which gives fuel for a PvP atmosphere.

Being on the streamer server is worth it. If you're a solo player the streamer raids are one of the best ways to catch up/experience content. 
---
Azshara, HOW THE FUCK DO I GET OUT OF HERE, FUCKING CLIFFS 
---
Prot is actually very solid for leveling, generating reckoning hits by sitting to force crits 
---
Faction: Horde - Because Horde!
---
Class: Warrior - Want to main a Tank this time
---
Race+gender: Troll Male - Kind of unique
---
Realm: PvP - PvE destroys the Horde vs Alliance
---
Professions: Engineering + Mining
---
Was stuck with Hunter for a good time but then Mage was my to-go for 6 months. Recently I read posts about Tanking and I have great awareness to my party/raid members with both OOM/Ninja pull/Write in chat etc which I feel most Tanks doesn't have, but tunnel vision.
---
The 10x Really sticky glue you get from a Barens quest can still be used at lvl 60.  
---
Thats completely incorrect. 2h fury warrior can easily compete with dual wield up to aq on horde.
---
The competition for gear while leveling, if you do most leveling together, can be a real pain. 
---
I used to show off by jumping the IF trench repeatedly. 
---
I don't even have the excuse of being 12 at the time
---
No-one apart from tanks wears FR in MC. Maybe the melee, but you‚Äôre usually fine using fire protection potions. If you‚Äôre struggling for first rag you can get the Ubrs buff too
---
I can't really tackle your math here. Let me say from experience that Improved Sap is great when leveling. It has tons of uses in PVP and PVE and can come in handy in dungeons as well. Don't forget that to get that 18 points in Sub you're getting some handy talents like increased damage from behind, lower stealth CD, faster stealth movement speed, and improved stealth. Those are all great talents and I've never regretted picking them. I level my rogues as "deep" subtlety most of the time, it's my favorite spec.
---
That being said, I find myself missing a lot so that hit talents would be a big comfort.
---
Main druid . Have an alt hunter for farming and messing around. 
---
I sometimes see people acting like people in vanilla weren't all that bad and the skill level wont be drastically different come classic. They really need to watch basically any video from the actual time period. 
---
Thousand Needles and Feralas. 
---
Teldrassil. I was happy when Sylvanas burned it down.
---
But did you hear? They're re-releasing the game. Now it's a thing of the future!
---
And also watch everyone give the gear to the streamer regardless of who needs it.
---
Did that in vanilla.  Surely a server named 'Feathermoon' wouldn't be High Pop!
---
FML.
---
Try Horde. I've done both and there's so much to gain from the experience. Even just exploring the nooks and crannies of the capital cities can be fun (well if you played a human rogue you might already have a bit of experience this way). You get to experience the true Barrens experience. Hell go all the way and make a shaman. 
---
Corpse camping is also known as harassment.
---
A good retribution paladin is better than a bad and unreliable anything else. It takes a lot of effort with gear and consumables just to still end up short of a half decent rogue or warrior. 
---
Nightfall with seal of righteousness is pretty good for a healer during easier encounters. 
---
http://i.imgur.com/yVSTr.jpg
---
&gt; Having 4+ sets of gear was fun
---
Not much room for other stuff in your bags then, huh? :P
---
Not much space in the bank. I wouldn‚Äôt carry everything all the time
---
I dont see any difference between that and joining an establish guild. outcome is effectively the same. Everyone funnels gear
---
Lazy warrior, you got a bow/gun.  I expect to see it out and you shooting Ony for 50 damage a pop and pulling your weight.  
---
Thats the world of warcraft that you play, ofc
---
Dustwallow Marsh 
---
lol so the situation above isn't accurate 
---
The only thing I intend to spread are the entrails of the wretched horde FILTH that fall to my blade as I cleanse their foul presence from the land!
---
Maybe. I won't be a "bad and unreliable anything" though. And definitely have no desire to level a character that can be good only because of better gear.
---
Take that back! Take it now! YOU MONSTER!
---
I bet you're a horde
---
For pvp though, paladins can really hold their own. Hunters are hard counters, but for anything else it‚Äôs at least an even playing field. 
---
If you need to clean some space in your bank just check on a database to see if it's actually useful later on. Don't worry too much cause there aren't too many of them!
---
Hands are a pretty good tool to have for playing Classic.  
---
Brian Kopp has a good guide for Alliance. I used it as a base and hit L60 in about 6 days even though I wasn't that great at the time.
---
Want to know a way to learn Azshara perfectly? Take herb and mining and go there. I hated Azshara before, now I know basically every polygon in that zone after farming there for roughly 200 hours.  
---
Oh god, this. I hate Dustwallow with a passion. 
---
It doesn't matter when it happened, really: they will do mergers again
---
Is there a FAQ for this subreddit or for Classic in general? I feel like we get these threads constantly.  
---
Constantly? Damn, I have been on this subreddit for for awhile and all I have been seeing is art posts
---
Pretty sure gnome mounts are bigger than other race's mounts.  
---
Even to this day.  
---
Really you make a WoW Classic reference with that shitbook?
---
Cast Blind, mash Sprint and hit Vanish. I'll live to fight another day. Pocket sand!
---
Is a hivemimd echo chamber really wanted though? Just for happy thought sake? 
---
A personal computer equiped with a keyboard are mandatory. 
---
Survival Hunter, seconded.
---
Also, shadow priest. I remember a level 42 shadow priest "healing" an SM Cath run just through his shadow dots. Very fun to abuse vampiric embrace
---
always go healing, fights in 5 mans are short and intense people r undergeared and take a lot of damage i dont think u need so much spirit or mp5 but but healing gives u the highest healing per second and when u r out u can drink mana potion and drink in between pulls.
---
I want to get lost in the leveling. I don't know which of the many alts that I am planning I am looking forward to more. I want to quest and farm in peace. I want endless days with nothing else to do, just like back in the day...
---
Yeah, it's not really in people's nature to remember just how bad they were. And the people that didn't play back then have no idea hard it was to get good when you couldn't just copy everyone around you. I made a tribute video for these people, you'll get a laugh out of it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpXmzYkUCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpXmzYkUCo)
---
It happens in every game though. The difference between a 2001 CS frag movie and a 2019 one is astounding.
---
Un‚ÄôGoro.
---
Remember the path leading to it from Tanaris? No, BECAUSE THERE ISN‚ÄôT ONE.
---
First thing you do in the zone is corpse run.
---
I want to live in this dungeon from 35-40. One of my best memories
---
Named after TCG hero?
---
Swamp of Sorrows
---
Remember armor and resistance values inclusive the formula behind those values are not correct on private servers. I found mobs on p realm which have almost none armor, means you grind them at an accelerated speed than it would be in real Classic, not to mention missing abilities on enemies.
---
There are so many things off and simply guesswork on private realms I doubt you can compare it to the real Classic.
---
Nice tree you got there.
---
Would be a shame if someone...
---
... burned it.
---
James or Joana I think are/were the most popular leveling guides.
---
&gt; Afaik the kid actor had legit ptsd and aged at much quicker rate than his peers, due to filming the movie.
---
Unsurprising. According to the Trivia section of IMDB:  
---
&gt; - Live ammunition was used in the film - in interviews, actor Aleksey Kravchenko has described actual bullets passing some 10 centimeters above his head.  
---
&gt; - The director planned to have Aleksey Kravchenko hypnotized by a psychotherapist during the most dreadful and violent scenes so that they wouldn't affect his young mind. However Kravchenko turned out not to be susceptible to hypnosis and had to pretend all the way.  
---
&gt; - It's been said that Aleksey Kravchenko was so overwhelmed with the film's subject matter that his hair turned gray during filming.  
---
Add, on top, that the movie was shot chronologically.  
---
Poor boy...
---
Burning Steppes. The instances are great but the actual zone is a bore fest. 
---
This really isn't something to be concerned about. I can guarantee by the time Classic releases there will be extensive levelling/questing addons that will make it very straightforward if you want to play that way/
---
that is very true, but i think the fact theres been a constant priovate server scene since as far back as 2008? it goes to show that people do indeed want to play older versions of wow
---
I remember warriors with this frequently spoiling our Scarlet Monastery group's carefully laid crowd control plans in one fell sweep. As a rogue I had to laugh (and occasionally Vanish).
---
I have done ubrs spoon many times and I never even see my breastplate drop (hunter). It was always so hard To find a group then you needed somebody with the key and it was actually hard to even clear it with randoms...never saw it drop. Still salty
---
Wdym? There is a pathway from Tanaris to Un'goro.
---
You are not wrong. There was more real discussion in November than there is today. 
---
They merged several realms for free. You‚Äôre 100% wrong about ‚Äúfree xfers from high pop to low‚Äù.
---
I can't believe Epic Games paid off Blizzard to put an Epic mount in Wow. It's disgusting. 
---
My experience as an Ele shaman who healed all 5 mans up to 60 disagrees with you. Shamans don't recover anything while  casting, so constantly casting is just not a good idea. Having your big heal go from 3 to 2.5 seconds has saved more then a few of my groups.
---
No, when in was younger having never played an MMO and being obsessed with everthing Warcraft i was in heaven when that game dropped. Exploring every nook and cranny looking for something cool. Being amazed at the scope of it, going door to door in ironforge to look for cool stuff. Seeing a hunter pet dinosaur in ironforge and being amazed. All while being young enough to have time to spend days at a time playing.
---
I can't relive those moments but I can play this again to try to capture a bit of the magic it held for me the first time.
---
I cant wait.
---
Only this time around  I'll have a kid on my lap to watch. 
---
Classic is ruined... Frick
---
Not bad, you could only do it once a day though right?
---
Hey mate you can come to our discoord. All people i know there from wow and we talk about wow classic. I also post videos there.

Come and stay a  while :)
---
It‚Äôs shocking to me how even it is. Most private servers are like 70/30 Alliance. 
---
These aren't very useful without splitting PvE and PvP servers tbh.
---
Messing with my settings right after creating my character and setting up all my UI stuff. 
---
Then hitting level 10 and getting all of my professions and talent stuff started. That's where I feel you start your real climb to 60.
---
My entire life has been a lie!
---
Still hate that place, though.
---
Getting full wailing caverns set f√ºr my rogue. Stats &lt; Look :)
---
Whats wrong with people? You do realize private servers operate on a reverse engineered emulator software with alot of values never made public by blizzard? Those speedrun times on p realms simply can't  be valid, because all the small inaccuracies do add up and skew the leveling times.
---
Every character I play, I find myself drawn back to being a Tauren Warrior. Sometimes, a thing just calls to you. Ironically, I figured ‚ÄúI like tanking, I‚Äôll try a Druid‚Äù and I hated it. Slowest, most boring class in vanilla. 
---
Enh shaman is a way better healer in low level dungeons than feral druid. Even things like sunken Temple and ZF is a breeze as a shaman with int offset.
---
And "spamming som AoE"? A shaman is not a mage. You got Chain Lightning, Magma Totem and Fire Nova Totem. If you try to spam them you will run out of mana in no time because they are extremely Mana expensive. And drinks are not super cheap if there is no friendly mage around (2s for each 1344mana back).
---
A feral druid does not benefit from WF-totem like a warrior does and you don't compete over that same gear aside from some weapons. A druid and shaman both use leather until 40.
---
Don't get me wrong, feral druid is a great partner because of matching speed and the versatility. But shaman and warrior is imo maybe the best duo because of the shamans toolset and warriors brute power.
---
(And warrior is a pain in the ass to level solo while druid is not).
---
And mithril spurs to complete the set. 
---
That's a good point. Sure the ratio looks good, but if PVP servers have 70% horde and PVE servers have 70% alliance, then the overall ratio doesn't even matter.
---
Yup. It's well known that Horde has superior PvP racials on average, but Alliance has superior PvE racials, so that's a potentially likely split.
---
While exploring the Twilight Grove in Duskwood, I found a big dragon.  I asked my (alliance) guild for help, but they wanted no part of it.  So I admired it for awhile and soon a single horde came by.  It wasn't long before a few more showed up.  Then more and more, and they had a full raid.  So this would be entertaining.
---
I readied my rifle, and just as their tank started forward, I let off a shot.  As my bullet flew, the dragon body-aggroed toward their tank.  Now, this was in the time before it was obvious who had tagged what, and it wasn't uncommon to kill some things only to be surprised that one or more of them didn't sparkle for you.  So I watched the show and waited.
---
They were doing really well, then after they had gotten the dragon most of the way down, they wiped.  I'm not sure if they simply couldn't handle the dragon, but the way I imagine it, they noticed me there and spent awhile discussing the situation before wiping intentionally.
---
Literally 50 50 right now.... wow
---
Nice rose tint. ;)

Hi, /u/darkemporer101
---
Even after I gave a vote [it's still perfectly matched!](https://i.imgur.com/CDJcI21.png)
---
Roges were we at
---
I really hope we don't see a beta, or if we do have it open for as little amount of time possible.
---
There are a shitload of massive streamers on Twitch who love Classic WoW, the last thing we want for the game is for them to burn themselves out before the official version of the game releases. We need these guys streaming the game as much as possible to garner more players via their influence, a longstanding beta could fuck that completely.
---
Because if you plan it out well it's possible to do it and it be completely unknown. You have the item in question or a better one, but go with your friend to double his chances. You unequip that item before you get there just in case anyone inspects you. Everyone drops group at the end and you trade it to your friend and tell him not to equip it for a few days. Perfect crime.
---
Free player transfer will fix it
---
Hi! thx for your guide )  
---
how much time will it take to craft a lmw? 1-1.5 hrs total? 
---
Thankfully good players dont pick their faction based on racial abilities. That decision comes before you choose your race, always.
---
Not effected? Everyone'll get ripped off at least a few times because of this. Most guilds would unfortunately tell their people to rip off others in pugs. If not right away, then eventually it would become the norm.
---
More than I'd like to admit ^^
---
I'm positive there'll be a mod for that.
---
Guess I'll have to multibox a private server under my Classic client to use Questie on...
---
It's from Durotar, one of the quests you do on Echo Isles.
---
Well said.
---
Fizzled out on the achievements angle pretty fast tho.
---
Listen up man:
---
Blizzard just increased the patch phases by 2 to 6. Why? 
---
Because the community wanted it and a longer cycle means more subscription money.
---
So lets say after 3 months and tourists traffic is slowing down, there are a couple of lowpop servers. But ppl leaving wow classic is bad, cause no subscription money then, so they will do everything to keep you: if its realm merging, free transfers to other realms or battleground groups. 
---
On top of that there will be paid character transfer, because it would be dump not opening this goldmine for them.
---

It was a joke about that you cant think about pservers on this sub

It's true.

---
Try it out. It is not as bad as you think
---
Getting to know the community as I level and hangout/pvp capped, it‚Äôs gonna be so cool having a close knit realm again.
---
For the tbc variant yes, wotlk one reduced damage altogether (post 3.2). But just the crit reduction effect already punishes certain builds which rely on it due to either relying on quick bursts (ele shaman comes to mind, but fire mage, deep destro lock, oomkin, even ret as well) or steady smaller crits (feral, enh -*skill*herald funsies aside-, rogue -shafting them hard away from CB/seal fate and more into sub variants-). 
---
Frost (mage) became the norm, since fire was severely punished for it. Ferals' combo point generation is reduced greatly (primal fury, +1cp on skill crit), ele shamans' burst is weakened as well...
---
And, honestly, the issue is it favored certain classes/specs greatly (by punishing most others) and it splitted PvP and PvE which personally is the worst part of it. 
---
Ah yes, back when even Warriors could off-heal with the power of **FIRST AID.**
---
Fuck your click bait

LOL, thats literally what the majority of this subreddit wants, 2-2,5k Pop (aka "dead servers"). So your wish is highly likely to become true.
---
Why would it not be in? ü§î
---
What you need to understand is that you can always write a ticket and have the gm give the item to whoever you want after you win it. Loot trading doesn¬¥t change a thing about the group abuse dynamics. We should instead lobby to have a policy that says no gm interaction with loot matters. 
---
I‚Äôd love to feel the same, but as a frequent visitor of comments, this place is the same kind of shithole that makes up any game forum. Only difference is we don‚Äôt actually have the game to bitch about yet and we don‚Äôt get any information to bitch about either.
---
Now, as with any game forum, there are some amazingly awesome people - but if you haven‚Äôt seen the toxic wave you are extremely lucky.
---
Westfall, its so fucking garbage compared to Barrens. I hate everything about it besides the defias quests which are somewhat doable.
---
There are actually good quests in Desolace tho...
---
Tanaris, Un'Goro, STV. I always skip them, and not because of trauma in the case of STV. I'm mainly a pve player, I just don't like the look of them. 
---
Bring on dat Desolace!

Agreed completely, I'm not one to pick based on the sentiment of "I need to be the best race" but a lot of people are.
---
a quick question to the spec you linked. Why only 1 point in Silent Resolve? 
---
I used to run with 5 in classic (haven't played since TBC) to avoid getting aggro. Maybe I sucked at aggro management, but so did a lot people I grouped with.
---
that was fantastic
---
Well it's not just restart. Theh had to update new patches and do other maintenance (maybe cleaning up logs and other things to keep servers healthy). Now days we are more advanced and it's possible just put up new environment and just swap them with current one
---
Great screenshots man :)

Isn't that picture from a private server?

It's actually 20 atp on the blue which is a +10 upgrade. Agi gives +1 atp per point to melee and +2 atp per point to ranged.

---
hey man, sure :) just pm me your email and I'll send it to you!
---
Not really, most people will be focused on leveling rather than pvping and ganking a lot. ofc being on a pvp server will make it extremely difficult for them to lvl up, but im sure theyll get there eventually.
---
that was great, thanks!
---
...you're intentionally promoting faction imbalance?
---
We're going home bros 
---
They knew they could so they did, but none ever stopped to ask if they should
---
That's weird, I remember standing on top of the alliance base in AV and shooting down Seed of Corruption at them with my warlock, which was only doable with walljumping 
---
I know right, I frequent all the big WoW communities for classic &amp; retail (even mmo-champion) and this place is by far the best of all the WoW communities.
---
But Blizzard already, accurately, tracks all these things, from day 1.  :(
---
Why the heck wouldn't weather be in the game? I don't see any reason to be concerned about this.
---
That is disingenuous. Barrens is a huge zone for 10-25 leveling for all of horde. Westfall is a 10-20 zone supplemented by redridge in your mid to late 10‚Äôs (17-20) and culminating in deadmines. You have the accesible option of loch modan if you run out of quests, and hate grinding. Barrens for the horde has enough (with a little help from stone talon) to keep you occupied until your early 20‚Äôs, at which point you can do wailing caverns. 
---
So many warlocks, holy fuck. But I‚Äôve expected it. 
---
Don't like clickbait but I do agree we need dynamic weather. Vanilla has a lot of atmosphere and this is needed to increase it further. 
---
That shimmery sound the lights/lamps make as you run past, amazing.
---
It you want to level engineering as you level, mining is mandatory. It you want to buy all the mats and power level it after you ding 60, mining is usually skipped.
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** Aggrael! ^(hug)
---
I've seen enough raids wipe on 1% to not laugh 
---
Yes! We have private servers, even though they were integral to bringing about Classic WoW!
---
delet this picture now!
---
I like being outnumbered ... just meant we had more people to kill in world PvP and instant queue BGs.  Being the dominant faction though is freaking terrible.  Almost can't find anyone in world PvP and BG queues are insanely long.  I am hoping to be the minority faction in classic.  
---
It was removed during Cataclysm because it wasn't compatible with the new engine.
---
It wasn't in the Classic demo.
---
They need to rebuild it from the ground up. So far there has been no word of it being developed and no evidence that it will be in the game.
---
Because it was removed during Cataclysm due to being incompatible with the engine, and it wasn't in the demo?
---
Yes PLEASE!
---
It's not too bad. I lurked on some pserver subreddits and they are generally terrible.
---
&gt;  But just the crit reduction effect already punishes certain builds which rely on it due to either relying on quick bursts
---
Wasn't that because those builds were overpowered in PvP?
---
^ post heavily downvoted.
---
It's baffling that this sub shits on the most dedicated Classic players/streamers/advocates there are. A sickness.
---
I know you are being fashionably sarcastic but ... low pop &lt;1000.  Medium is probably more like 1000-2000 and high pop over 2000 as far as vanilla was concerned.  Obviously private servers are different but the majority of people do not want that.
---
Yeah you're right about that. What this sub reddit has over private server ones is the mix between private server players and current or old retail players so it's not as bad. Communities that are made up from 100% private server players are incredibly toxic.
---
Classic is not vanilla as best it can be. It needs to be 1.0 or it's changes and not the game I bought and played back in 2004.

Thanks! Well my "fuzzy math" was just a way to symbolize that damagewise the 18 points I put in sub would be similar to 9 pure damage talents in the other trees. So the Sub utility would "cost" approximately 10% damage.

So you feel like improved Stealth noticable enough to not get the +damage to openers?

A nice guild and a mic for Discord.

Yeah 1.0 or bust. 
---
Dwarves will always be my favourite race, and the alliance zones in general I always found to be a lot nicer to level in.
---
But after a lot of time deciding I'm pretty sure I've settled on playing a druid. And fuck Night Elves.
---
Ohh, yeah, my bad, sorry bud
---
It's really not. I lurk on the Pantheon sub and what I've seen there has substantially reduced my desire to play the game. Whereas coming to this sub gets me more hyped for the game. This sub has its hot topics, but people generally aren't too awful to each other, and there's also a lot of support - people ready to provide info to newbies and so on.

I'll roll on the other side and stresmsnipe to even the odds.

Loot allocation system?

So you want us to wait a few days so that you can get on with your levelling first, and you have the audacity to call us selfish? 
---
I agree the community eagerly attempts to achieve the perfect WoW Classic. However, people don't believe in the developers whatsoever, regardless of however they please them. Rest assured, when Classic launches and flawlessly replicated vanilla successfully, people still complain about this and that. 
---
Obviously, this is an integral part of Classic, but people should at least regard the developers as intelligent people, not imbeciles ignoring any feedback whatsoever, as they proved otherwise. 
---
Oh... shit. Yeah this is a big deal then. Classic needs weather.
---
Warrior + shaman is the best class combo in the game thanks to windfury totem.
---
I reckon he's more on the fact that STV on pservers is a totally different experience from how it was on actual Vanilla. If Blizzard adheres to the original realm caps you most probably won't see STV being pserver like, but a lot more vanilla like with a lot less PVP. 
---
All the starting zones are just fine, play through whichever one you want to.
---
Fuck dont remember me
---
U gonna dualwield tho
---
Jumping up the orgrimmar gate was fun indeed, but wont happen again sadly
---
Very simple.
---
 A Guild named Milleniun did stream the xp progress on Cataclysm. The streamers got camped, perma killed and followed. They turned off the stream 6h after.
---
I would love to just piss off a streamer and gank him as hell. He will feel the real Vanilla experience.
---
Streamer will definitly kill the server they will go on. Their Vanilla experience will never be the one we had so I am ok with that. 
---
The reason Vanilla is Vanilla is that the whole world was part of the game from start to finish. RPG elements were key for this, dumb item design and class balance was part of this. Nonsense level 40 greens being BIS all the way to BWL was part of this. All of the bullshit/good things in Vanilla worked together to make an unforgettable world, a world all of us want to be in again.
---
People who want Vanilla+ content have good intend, i don't doubt that. But please, consider very carefully that the team is different, the vision is different.
---
A wrong move in that new content can very well destroy  anything. In order for it to work, the new stuff should be broken and imbalanced as all that came before it, otherwise you will have WoTLK. 
---
While a great expansion, the moment ToC/IC came along, 80% of the content became easy and completely useless.
---
Too much can be lost with one mistake. I really hope i wont have to come back after 3 years and write "I told you so".
---
Wacky items and RPG elements and full scale world was the price WoW had to pay in order to achieve some balance.
---
And in the end there is no balance again, in fact there is no such thing as balance. People and specs are benched still in BFA, even worse than Vanilla.
---
So how do you balance and add new content which keeps these level 40 greens still being bis pre raid? What difficulty and drops are there in the new raids/dungeons? Are the gear dropped and mechanics of the contend balanced enough so i don't have to run it few times at level 60 and forget about anything but the coresponding raid that came with these dungeons?
---
What if it turns into IC where you run the new 3 dungeons few times and you are ready for ToC/IC raids? Be careful what you people are asking for. As i said i know you want good for the game, but please realize that the reason for Vanilla to be great was the fact that all the bad and good things worked together.
---
Wanding onyxia as a warlock
---
Cuz 1 shadowbolt is enough to break aggro and wipe the raid if you crit
---
Mulgore is prollly the fastest cause not much people will be starting there. Orc/troll and undead are more played then taurens.
---
I am generally not a fan of the bleak zones at level cap. Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes and Eastern Plaguelands.  
---
There is some merit to them, but it doesn't last long before it gets boring. There are way too many of those kinds of zones.
---
Do hpalas actually need to do that? Kinda puts me off from choosing pala
---
If only there were some whelp packs
---
Why not alliance?
---
You should try 21/0/30, you really get all you need from the holy tree and it allows you to get Vengeance in the Rey tree. Super fun build!
---
I think you misunderstand what I meant by extreme.
---
Alleria had maybe 20 people in Org at any given time.  Constantly ganked if flagged by Alliance just standing around INSIDE ORG.  Get out of a BG and them drop dead.  Auction house reps dead for half of every day.  After the free server transfers to Magtheridon, it was unplayable for Horde.  
---
Female orc rogue, combat daggers. Can pve and pvp with one spec, but heavily reliant on thistle tea in pvp. Damage scaling is great, don't need very much gear to pump out DPS due to the high backstab crit chance. Once you are geared you will do very well on the meters.
---
I've got a rouge man !
---
Herb/mining until epic mount. Then drop herb for engineering and be a pvp God.
---
I can‚Äôt live without divine favour holy shock for burst. Only way I‚Äôve managed to take out geared healers, is by surprising them with it on top of a HoJ judgement of command with ZHC popped
---
Yes the corpses show very high pop
---
Most content on this sub is pserver
---
Hunters are the alpha predators during leveling
---
This one is the best.
---
So you can kill yourself and raid quit at 2% of onixia for the 3-4 free raid  every week
---
If you're looking at things from a numbers perspective it's easy to discount better stealth. However in actual gameplay terms it's extremely useful. It's great in PVP for obvious reasons, and just makes stealth so much more forgiving in PVE. There's nothing worse than being spotted by an enemy as you try to sneak through their camp and now you're fighting 4 of them. Once you roll with improved stealth you'll wonder how you did without it. If I had to pick one at endgame, I'd go with the +dmg. But I like em enough to choose both.
---
Got any source for this? Afaik Blizzard has never merged realms before the "CRZ" era
---
*gutter speak*
---
I guess windfury
---
It‚Äôs going to be hard to answer. We just don‚Äôt know what the state of the game will be come classic launch  in terms of sharing/sharing mob tags.
---
If there are #NoChanges then all zones will be a shit show as tagging mobs and waiting for clickable item respawns will create massive bottle necks.
---
To try answer your question I think Durotar is the fastest. 
---
No they aren't, they are again 50/50 the majority of the time. The only time you see a split like that is on an RP server. 
---
I agree, so in order to find that we should look at:
---
" 
---
## Which of the Horde starting zones is fastest to level through?
---
 I'm about to test each of the 3 starting  zones for  horde(Mulgore,Durotar, and Tirisfal glades) myself to see what my  fastest personal record is, but before I do I'd like to consult the  community on this one and see what your results have shown. The main  reason here is should I ditch TG on my fresh undead mage and run strait  to durotar? "
---
JuSt Go WiTh WhAt Is FuN, Im ImPlYiNg YoUr SpEeD rUnS ArE tHe WrOnG KiNd Of FuN.
---
What about helping with adds?
---
Such a simple and elegant solution. It just makes sense. 
---
Typically it's people who are too lazy to come up with actual reasons as to why they hate a certain zone, so they chose the most "useless" zones, despite the fact they were designed with that in mind.
---
Yeah hurricane style! Thats what he was hired for hopefully
---
I read this and I choked on my coke, nice one.
---
If you want to go to great enough lengths to run from tirisfal to mulgore you are better off doing exploration/death jump leveling, then taking the zepp and doing the same through durotar while killing yellow or weaker mobs. After that you might consider running the barrens to mulgore. There are guides to get to lvl 10 killing few mobs.

Making my work night that much better, thank you.

Awesome to see my old server on here! Ner'zhul. I believe he was in Blue Moon or Lost Anarchy
---
What epic wep was that?
---
xd raiding without consumable buffs people now will never allow this
---
Drain life does as much damage as your wand will do but will generate more threat because of the heal, so you are more likely to pull agro of the vw. On the other hand you dont even need the heal as you will only take damage from tabbing.
---
So for vw you will apply your dots, wand and finish of with (rank 1) drain soul for the mana reg buff
---
Servers with a healthy population will always have smaller guilds still going through the low tier raids
---
Hurricane (Radim Zeifart) left Blizzard shortly after, he now works at [Symbio.agency](https://Symbio.agency), which is a CG company in prague that does short films and commercials.
---
He doesn't want to deal with ganking which definitely still happens on RP-PvP so that rules it out in favor of normal RP-PvE server.
---
Because you have no valid argument, merely hyperbole.
---
Dazzling longsword from the turtles in Tanaris. 
---
It was a pretty good tanking weapon for leveling as far as I remember, but being a noobie 13 year old hunter who didn't know better I went ahead and equipped it anyway. 
---
Finish warlock epic mount quest, feels soooo good
---
Thats how you pick a dead realm
---
To level to 300, mats will cost you around 50g (based on pservers I played on) which is pretty cheap.
---
Drain tanking is literally what it sounds like. You face tank the mob and use drain life to constantly heal yourself. With talents put into improved drain life and pushback reduction, it becomes a very effective strategy for grinding out the levels.
---
So pulling agro off your voidwalker is no concern for the drain tanking warlock. 
---
Only thing missing from classic wow - A release date.
---
I know what drain tanking is, i answered your question?!
---
You said drain life pulled vw agro, but that doesn't matter. And you said you don't need the heal, but you do because you're allowing yourself to take the hits.
---
Im tempted to wait out the first week until I figure out what server is worth playing on
---
&gt; It's code for "it was bullshit that someone could play 5 arenas a week and have better/the same gear than me for pvp". You're time invested and the gear you earn shouldn't be worthless in another part of the game. They should of either made PvP gear harder to earn/take more time or never have split the two.
---
What rating do you think you could get in TBC playing five arenas per week?
---
I see what you mean and now I think of it... It is indeed my experience too(leveling a horde druid 1-60, then returning to my lvl 35 ally hunter, which is now 48)

Loot Council
---
Sylvanas did nothing wrong!
---
Look I'm getting tired of replying to you, because not only do your arguments are beginning to make less sense, but I feel like this will be an endless back and forth. But I'll spell it out for you one last time.
---
You brought up PvE servers. But that has nothing to do with the argument we were discussing; fairness in PvP. So, again, so what they have PvE servers and so what they play battlegrounds? You've really lost me there.
---
Again, the amount of times of health or damage is inconsequential when considering the root of the problem. The epics vs greens argument is parallel to your issue. Which is, you don't want to face overpowered opponents in PvP. 
---
No changes is far from a stupid slogan, because changes means leaving decisions in the hands of Activision-Blizzard and the pandering of casuals, who like yourself, complain about everything. You can see its results in modern WoW.
---
I do not in fact see the irony. Not only do I not pick and choose anything, but you're also advocating for a change that only ruins other people's classic experience.
---
What do you mean? Pals don't have wands and there's usually enough paladins in the raid anyway.
---
"error determining video format"

i remember getting borderline depression playing on nostalrius in the human zones from the constant rain

then i googled it and it was apparently a unique private server issue where it rains way more than its supposed to, its nice once in a while but it got gloomy and depressing af
---
At best in their niche, like the elemental shaman case and PoM-pyros, maybe oomkin, but they still had enough trade-offs (namely lowish survivability aside straight gearing, specially the low cc shaman) outside their once-in-3-min insane burst. 
---
Ferals were underdog before and after until 3.x made them reliable. 
---
Enh had been stabbed enough with the icd on WF. And well, lolret was lolret for a reason. 
---
it should be awesome on a paladin with the attack speed seal
---
&gt; I just think it could be really hard to predict what the playerbase will look like, and I hope Blizzard has a plan to address what happens when the casuals drop out 
---
Blizzard's plan for this was already presented at Blizzcon 2017.
---
To be fair (and don't get me wrong here) I am amazed that so many people STILL don't know that. Ion Hazzikostas, when talking about sharding, clearly said that one of the reasons to implement sharding in a limited and temporary manner for the first few weeks at Classic launch is to ensure a good population of realms AFTER the tourist wave quits.
---
Sharding is the ONLY possible way to tackle the tourists wave. The launch of Vanilla and the launch of Classic are very different. When Blizzard launched Vanilla, they started with 40 realms and 2,500 players per realm. They had to create new realms, to accommodate new players.
---
For Classic, they will most likely NOT open new realms, unless the number of people that want to play Classic is vastly underestimated by Blizzard. To understand the numerical difference between a Vanilla and a Classic launch, and why sharding will be in Classic for launch, instead of new realms in Vanilla, I will try to put it as simple as I can.
---
Vanilla realms started with the TOTAL PLAYER CAP = CONCURRENT PLAYER CAP = 2,500 .Simply because EVERYONE who bought WoW at launch would play in the same time, for quite a while. By the end of Vanilla, there were roughly 700 realms and over 7.5 million active accounts, which means that the median value for TOTAL population cap in Vanilla was 10,000 per realm, while the CONCURRENT player cap was still 2,500 per realm.
---
With Classic, such a launch (2,500 TOTAL and CONCURRENT player cap) would be STUPID, because everyone with 2 neurons knows that in 2 weeks, the tourists will be gone, and every single realm will be low pop and very low pop. But everyone also knows that the realm population cap in Classic must be close to late Vanilla realm population cap : 10,000 players in TOTAL, 2.500 CONCURRENT players.
---
Nobody knows exactly how many tourists will play Classic and leave in a few weeks...but estimating the percentage is not a big issue. Let's say that between 50% and 70% of the Classic players at launch are tourists and BfA players that will occasionally play Classic.
---
Since a healthy realm cap for Classic is around 10,000 players, with 2,500 concurrent players (ofc, the concurrent cap can be raised slightly if needed, and this will help a lot), AFTER the tourists and the occasional BfA players are gone, to accommodate ALL players at launch (true Classic ones and tourists), Classic realms will have to open with a TOTAL cap of 20,000 to 25,000 players.
---
The ONLY RELIABLE WAY to have those 20-25k players playing in DAY ONE, and PRESERVE a healthy pop of 10,000 players a month or two after launch... is SHARDING. Now, my numbers are just a numerical example. Blizzard have plenty of data and projections. 
---
**But the math is the same : Classic realms will launch with 10,000 players + the estimated % of tourists**.
---
And Ion clearly said that one of the reasons for sharding is to ensure a healthy pop after tourists drop out.
---
Yeah 20 people in org is .... pretty bad.  What was the server split then like 90+% ally to &lt;10% horde?  Usually extreme was like 70-30 at most.
---
Those videos hype you up everytime. He was only one person doing it in his spare time if I am not mistaken, so I hope Blizzard goes for it too!
---
Hurricane has videos of the bigger content patches and T5. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/Hurricane046
---
Oh, I see. That would be a shame indeed. Weather effects did not always exist in Vanilla though, they were added in a later patch. Not that they shouldn‚Äôt be in from the start ofc, but some people may not remember that. 
---
Another thing also, Barrens and Westfall don‚Äôt have any weather effects that I can recall so the demo isn‚Äôt really confirmation that they‚Äôre not there?
---
&gt; You brought up PvE servers. But that has nothing to do with the argument we were discussing; fairness in PvP. So, again, so what they have PvE servers and so what they play battlegrounds? You've really lost me th
---
I'll walk you through it slowly.
---
You said people who think twinkers suck would be upset if they got ganked by a 60 in world PvP. I assume you thought this was an argument in favour of twinkers.
---
I pointed out to you that Blizzard seems to think it is entirely understandable and reasonable if you do not want to get ganked by a 60, because they make available Normal/PvE servers where this cannot happen.
---
So it makes no sense to think that because Blizzard lets gankers gank on PvP server that must mean they also want to let griefers spoil battlegrounds that PvE and PvP players participate in.
---
&gt; Again, the amount of times of health or damage is inconsequential when considering the root of the problem. The epics vs greens argument is parallel to your issue. Which is, you don't want to face overpowered opponents in PvP.
---
The point of having brackets and divisions and such in computer games is to prevent serious mismatches that make bad games. If the max level in a bracket is 19 and someone has found a way to smuggle in what is effectively a level 25 character that is a problem.
---
You can try to personalise the issue by whining "*you* don't want to face overpowered opponents in PvP", but the bottom line is that overpowered opponents make a bad game. If you can't see that you do not understand very much about games.
---
&gt; No changes is far from a stupid slogan, because changes means leaving decisions in the hands of Activision-Blizzard and the pandering of casuals, who like yourself, complain about everything. You can see its results in modern WoW.
---
That is a simplistic narrative for simplistic people.
---
Want me to blow your mind? I actually played in retail vanilla. *Nobody* who actually played retail vanilla put it on a pedestal and thought there should never ever be any changes. That's entirely a perversion cooked up by the self-selecting pirate server community.
---
&gt; I do not in fact see the irony. Not only do I not pick and choose anything
---
Your dumb opinions are not any less dumb because you got all your opinions in one big package deal off youtube instead of thinking them out for yourself. If anything the opposite.
---
&gt; you're also advocating for a change that only ruins other people's classic experience.
---
When you grow up a bit you will maybe realise that other people matter too, not just you. You can have the "experience" of getting your rocks off bullying and griefing people, or other people can have the "experience" of fun battlegrounds without your kind in it. I think the second is a win for everyone except you.
---
MORE DOTS 
---
Again I would argue that Warriors are the last class that should receive any buffing. I think it's more than a QoL change. In the context of TBC it may not have been OP but in 1.12 context it effectively frees up 2-6 talent points for warriors. If you give that to warriors, then you need to give something else to all other classes too, which has the chain effect.
---
If you want it that bad in vanilla, you can have it. So I don't really see the issue. Pretty much every single warrior build covers it already anyway
---
31/20/0, 17/34/0, 31/5/15 etc
---
Imo: Warriors, Rogues and Mages need no adjustment.
---
Warlocks possibly none either.
---
SPriest, Druid, Paladin, Shaman could use a little retouching.
---
sucks to be a frost mage exploiting latency for shatter combos then, balance changes inc.
---
Having a retail mascot for Classic is a bit contradicting.
---
Reddit should get together and just pick one single server to go on
---
So what if its supplemented by other zones, Westfall just has a lot of annoying quests I don't like. Like the dam cooking quests, all the travel quests, the fucking gnolls and murlocs.
---
Redridge is also quite good, but if we compare Westfall to only northern barrens (XR and Ratchet) I would still take barrens over westfall anyday.
---
Most game forums pre release are really nice and full of hope. Go check others out. It‚Äôs after the game has been out for a while and things change, that is when it gets toxic. 
---
It was mentioned by the devs during the Blizzcon panel that the weather effects were something that wasn't in the game as of now.
---
Also people 'hacked' the client and went to every zone. Pretty much all the non-instanced zones were accessible and seemingly 100% finished (except for mobs) and they all had beautiful looking day and night cycles.
---
Absolutely no weather effects, though.
---
Is this really still a thing with region bound servers, from Europe i can play on US or Oceanic server these days in several games and not get 200ms ping.
---
It will be the same in Classic. A DEAD EVEN split.
---
This is HUGE for Blizzard, because they can LOCK DOWN character creation on every single realm if a faction reaches the cap.
---
They couldn't do that in Vanilla...because they had NO IDEA what people will play.
---
But now, they can, especially because all the data points to a even split between factions.
---
They were added in patch 1.10 Storms of Azeroth.
---
I play on a ~2k pop blizzlike server, fantastically blizzlike.
---
I still feel immense release when I hearth out of STV -_-
---
But yes, it's not an absolute clusterfuck like it is on high pop pservers. But it is terrifyingly dangerous!
---
I'm hoping they get it in. I hope the community is vocal about this, because it's a huge part of the awesome wonderful atmosphere of Vanilla WoW.
---
Even better in tbc with Flamestrike&gt;blastwave&gt;dragons breath&gt;arcane explosion
---
&gt; Guild leader wants to roll shaman, which I find a bit confusing as he has always been a shaman since vanilla 
---
Players that started in Vanilla and played it extensively, have a SOLID attachment to their MAIN. Most Vanilla players will roll the SAME MAIN they had in Vanilla.
---
It's confusing for you, maybe, because you haven't played Vanilla and you can't understand then attachment to your main in Vanilla.
---
It's definitely pleasant to be part of a group that is excited about something, especially since most of the negativity that does exist is aimed at concepts. I always enjoy Vanilla stories. 
---
If you want some positive subreddits/online spaces then look into those that are dedicated to a hobby (and no, video games are not a hobby). These groups are extremely constructive and encouraging and the creative energy brings out the best in people. 
---
Durator. The colour scheme is really ugly and there‚Äôs nothing particularly interesting compared to other starter zones. The troll islands are nice I guess. 
---
&gt; Your reply does give me hope for this subreddit though FeelsStrongMan
---
It shouldn't. I am made to feel completely alien here every day.
---
God damn, imagine have the foresight to take screenshots, I didn't take a single one back then
---
I highly doubt the difference in time is enough to make up for the added travel time.
---
They should just pay Hurricane and use those.
---
50/50 still after exactly 800 votes
---
Yeah, I definitely had the whole set. The world was too big to be slow. :)

FOR THE HORDE!

I remember having that! Was fun to pop, and then just die while standing next to someone, and have them wondering what killed you.

Bold of the Scourge to set up plague cauldrons across WPL ***when they are within crusading distance.***

Nothing wrong with integrity, or voting with your wallet.

so there is 1 pala on justice duty?
---
I was a hoarder of all these kind of things. Not sure if I used them often enough for them to warrant a bank spot, but I have no regrets.
---
I kept just about everything. Linken‚Äôs Sword, and other random cool quest rewards I couldn‚Äôt use on my Druid, that mechanical chicken, really sticky glue. 
---
Just about everything I could find that seemed even slightly unique. 
---
The fact that more than half of this post contains insults or just dances around the arguments says enough.
---
Isn't this the movie where they used live ammo?
---
Alliance and horde both have quest zones there and it has a huge amount of quests to do that keep you there for a lot of levels so not many ppe Want to skip the zone 
---
Dps on a decent range wep is not that bad. Better than nothing.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
I've always been pulled to play a moonkin. My favorite spec.
---
:( the worst spec in vanilla next to ret paladin 
---
I haven't played retail since the start of Panda, but I think I still have a woolen bag in my bank.
---
I started one of the first guilds on my server. I was an enchanter, and was giving out free low level enchants all the time just to level my enchanting, giving away random other items to friendly people, and seeing if people wanted to join the guild as well.
---
Years later one of my long time guild friends passes me a woolen bag and says "I joined this guild because you helped me with some stuff, and gave me a woolen bag, and I just wanted to return the favour".
---
I don't think it was the same bag, and I think it was done in a humorous context, but I stashed it away anyway.
---
Alliance I just can't stand the feel of spending most of my time in cities made of mud huts while looking at dead people and orcs all day
---
Also I don't really want to play on the side of edgy 12 year Olds who want to gank as an undead rogue. 
---
Alright boys find your favorite fucking disturbed song and blast that shit cuz we‚Äôre goin back to 2005.
---
This will be difficult initially for WW quest, if ally not a big deal - bone biter (SM quest) but horde, youre probably better off skipping this Q if your pushing for a fastish 60 
---
Yes really. If you saw any of the streamers even attempt the classic demo, i.e. Forsen, Asmongold, etc. You'd have seen them swarmed by streamsnipers and then unable to even attack a single mob. And that's just PvE.   
---
Next you've got PvP and if the streamer even made it so far up to level 20, they'll then have to compete with a constant Horde vs Alliance battle around them because streamsnipers would be both factions and fighting each other while also trying to grief the streamer. It won't work no matter what server they play. 
---
Wait this sub discusses something besides loot trading? /s
---
Lok'tar, bitch.
---
LIVE. TO. WIN!!!!!!
---
I'd expect this to happen after the game is finished, after the release date is announced, and probably after a handful of other things.
---
At this stage I don't think they would even have finalized how many servers, let alone their names.
---
Live to win! 
---
Dustwallow is nice, most of the quests are clumped together real close so you breeze through the zone. Cant say I like Duskwood very much though, probably due to always hitting the wall with melee classes around that level, having to hop onto green quests or stand a 50/50 chance of killing every equal level mob.  
---
For some reason I have ways missed out on Wetlands, Hinterlands and Azshara when leveling, even though the countless of times both on classic and private servers... 
---
Haha I just started looking up classic wow, and stumbling upon this picture a memory of my first lvl 60 rushed to my head. It happened in the exact same spot! 
---
Do you want reputation towards a different mount other than the undead?  
---
If so, go to their starting zone even if it takes you a little extra time. The amount of rep you'll get from quests will greatly reduce the amount of runecloth you have to turn in at 60.  
---
If you don't care about a different mount, then staying in Tirisfal will be faster.   
---
VanCleef was the biggest badass that wasn't a raid boss.
---
I imagine it would depend on the content time line of retail 
---
They can with or without loot trading you idiot lmao literally nothing changes
---
A second monitor. 
---
I'm serious if you don't have one you should bloody well get one.
---
Tbh i expected warriors to be leading by far.. 
---
I've changed the professions to not be required now.. not sure it matters anymore tho 
---
Full Valor on the other hand... Yeah, better leave that one in the past. :D
---
Yeah mmo-champion is an all out war between vanilla haters and retail haters. No point in trying to discuss anything there.
---
So you're saying quests will be too populated? 
---
Where are your throwing daggers/axes? 
---
Pantheon was great until Alexensual and his toxic private server followers invaded the place. Considering the Pantheon team supports him too that game is a a lost cause.
---
It definitely felt 90/10.  Not sure how I'd be able to know for sure.
---
There was a big ripple effect.  Players can't compete so they consider changing factions.  A friend leaves faction or server, so their friends leave.  Their guild can't sustain itself anymore, those members consider leaving too.  Population drops and Blizzard includes your server in the free transfer group.  Now any Horde left had a free way out.  Only took a couple months.  It was a PvE server so the Alliance were never unhappy, and cross realm BGs existed.  It was just a perfect storm.
---
My IRL friend Donnie played a Human Mage and stayed when I took the free realm transfer.  I remember going back and visiting and remember see more alliance than horde in their own capital at times.  Pretty nuts.
---
Sorry for the rant but I've never been able to share that little bit of my first servers forgotten history.  Idk what Blizzard plans to do after hype dies down or a year in or w/e, but I suspect another server could share that fate if they aren't forced to merge.
---
Interesting how he suddenly left the discussion ;)
---
Not necessarily
---
as long as you are exalted with ironforge. 
---
It's a reputation grind, so do every quest you can find that gives Ironforge rep and then get ready to turn in a lot of cloth later on. It's easy, just takes a while. 
---
probably Azshara becasue of the cliffs an getting that douse quest.
---
I don‚Äôt care what you do. You have the same opportunity as everyone else. Not hard at all to distinguish my position from yours. 
---
He's not even entertaining.
---
good to see its close to 50/50. In real vanilla I remeber them saying alliance outnumbered horde by a decent amount. In burning crusade the blood elfs helped make it much closer.
---
All of those are perfectly fair arguments. And that is what I am advocating for: discussions and real arguments. Because the "slippery slope" one is not an actual argument.
---
Having said that, I still want to respond to your arguments regarding (class) balance. There is no point in talking about perfect balance, that is nothing that can ever happen. But I believe that there should not be a blatant imbalance. What is the point of having a protection tree for paladins, if they not viable as raid tanks? What is the point of having DPS shaman speccs, if they are extremely sub-par in comparison to the other classes? It's just bad design.
---
And obviously new content, if there ever will be any, has to be carefully crafted and designed.
---
So it should be pretty natural since i kinda do the same quests as dwarves?
---
Thats a lot closer to blizzlike for sure, but to be truely Blizzlike it should only be +-2k (or a bit more) pop at absolute peak times, if its +-2k pop concurrent around the clock its actually far from Blizzlike. A lot of pservers have this issue because they aren't dividing the playerbase in regions (which is logical for a pserver). In original Vanilla STV was also the first "PVP hotspot" but depending on the time of day and age of the server it could also be very quiet, even in STV. During the day and during the night lvling in STV generally was "a breeze", while during primetime there was a lot more action going on, especially early on. Later on even the evenings were getting quite calm.

Hello, 
---
**Current name:** \[Addiction\]  -  We are taking input in from our community to change the name, Class names and Raid Leads. This is an open discussion
---
**Region/Raid Time:** NA -  Eastern Standard Time with 2-3 raid days for progression and gear
---
**Server Type:** PVP
---
**Faction:** Horde......Alliance can F\*\*k off ;) 
---
**Priorities:** Raid First, PvP second but we like the construct of the ability for open PvP. 
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/ntzyJEW](https://discord.gg/ntzyJEW)
---
**Rules/About Us:** Currently, we are a mature group of men and women. It's a discord where there is freedom of discussion of whatever topics and many of us have known each other for literally 15+ years. Some in this discord are family members and good friends. We have roughly 20 people who will be playing Classic WoW here with the launch expected 4-6 Months(Summer of 2019) 
---
The roles of what ever class and profession are open but it looks like we may be hurting for main tank, and healers but do have a few who are rolling in those areas. 
---
Looking for people who want to take on roles of leading others or those who want to follow and enjoy this game like we have in the past. 
---
If interested pop into our discord and drop a message to either my self "JayD" or "Zorac" 
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah because you start in the same zone it‚Äôs not to hard. 
---
Did you run into a mage bot farm?  Lol
---
Like 7 mages farming together with arcane explosions.  That was really funny.
---
I agree, a good hunter can dish out some serious numbers. We had two dedicated ones in our guild that always were in the top 5, often top 3.
---
Not decided yet. I'll see what my friends will play.
---
I played on Garithos in retail Vanilla, a relief server for Blackrock, Illidan, and Warsong. It was still a low-medium pop server after the transfers. 
---
Question is if we can trust current blizzard or leave it as is. I simply cant get by the fact that the old team is gone. The team we have made us want vanilla. In my case, yes, im against any changes. Mostly because of trust issues. Slippery slope can be avoided thats for sure, but it will take immense dedication from the devs to keep the world of vanilla relevant at every point of the game.
---
Not sure they are capable of this though. BFA is no longer either an MMO or an RPG, specs are benched even though they sacrificed much to get close to "balance". Diablo fiasco, an overall questionable decisions over the years that cause many to grab the pitchforks.
---
So even if we take the risk, what about people that don't want that? I assume separated servers will come but that also raises questions.
---
Example.
---
Vanilla: No changes server.
---
Vanilla: Changes server.
---
Vanilla: Servers with seasonal resets, like ARPG-s.
---
Eventual: TBC servers with the same branches as the Vanilla ones.
---
PVE servers.
---
PVP servers.
---
Can the game afford to split a community that might not even be big enough anyway? First few months, hype and streamers wont exist forever.
---
Can a game be good for everyone? Nah, nothing can be.
---
So the question that bugs me the most is simple. Are we better without changes or risk it and &gt;maybe&lt; fail. Im thinking more for the long run, the hype is real but if a day comes where big enough part says "i want true Vanilla" we are back to square zero.
---
Don't know man, maybe im paranoid but i wouldn't take that risk. 
---
Lot of rogues/warriors for ony
---
No excuse for any of them to NOT be bow shooting that dragon bitch
---
who are you?
---
Roll on an RP server and you should be safe. 
---
In 1.12 you‚Äôre saying death coil could not be trinketed?
---
I have trinketed it many a times in pservers
---
Are you sure it was 1.12?
---
Son, that don‚Äôt make any sense! There‚Äôs second place, third place, hell, even fourth. I musta been high when I said that!
---
Who's an entertaining WoW streamer then?
---
That may be true for some people, but not all. 
---
I mained Rogue in Vanilla. Currently I‚Äôm planning on rolling a Priest or Pally for healing in Classic. I don‚Äôt want to try to recreate my Vanilla experience because I know it won‚Äôt be the same (game may be close, but life is drastically different). 
---
Personally I‚Äôm looking for a completely new experience out of this game. 
---
Explain to me how you actually use this item effectively in PvP? I understand it's uses (the speed bonus and breaking poly) but there are so many limitations as well:
---
-You have to wait 30 secs before you can use it upon equipping it. This is an eternity in PvP.
---
-It's an offhand item, making it very punishing for warriors and ret palas.
---
Most people lacked time, not mental stamina. Most people don't have free time to complete rank 14 yet some put 10+ hours a day for it, most people don't have time to wait to gear 8 tanks and be there every single raid
---
Dunno if you played on that ''famous vanilla private server'' but streamers always did huge events and it was really fun and that's why I'm joining a streamer server too. I've played a lot on that famous vanilla private server and I cannot have that ''Classic experience'' anymore because I know everything about the game. 
---
That's why I'm not scared of being on a dead realm because streamers will keep the servers alive.
---
Paladin.
---
What about macros? 
---
Mage is probably the most straightforward class, and has nice utility with teleports and water. Mage/hunter maybe?

If you do all the quests in Dun Morogh and Loch Modan that should set you up to be exalted before hitting 60 no problem. If you want to be exalted right at 40 then you will need to actively seek out ironforge quests while they are still in your level range (not gray yet) using a list like this: https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?faction=47#quests:0-5+1+2
---
Yeah, I think so. I leveled a dwarf and was very close to exalted with gnomeregan when I got 40.
---
With BRE, sure. 
---
I‚Äôm having trouble understanding- you girlfriend is a gamer? Then she‚Äôs probably played plenty of RPGs before and can out her class on her own. Are you saying you‚Äôre the newb?
---
I suggest mage or paladin for total newbs either way.
---
Not to mention there‚Äôs only 1 GY in the zone. Love 5+ min walkbacks
---
Paladins will always be healing. Shamans can do damage in pvp.
---
Fuck wpl and andoral
---
How can you skip ungoro, so many easy quests to stack and do together
---
The most effective way to level a warlock is to have voidwalker tank one mob while another is kept feared. Both fully DoT'd up and then wanded to death. Once one mob dies immediately pull another, only briefly resting when necessary to allow voidwalker to consume shadows back to full health while the warlock bandages or eat/drinks.
---
Voidwalker's mana will last far longer if torment is manually used a limited number of times each mob since this will give it a lot more time outside the five second rule to regen. This isn't really viable when solo killing mobs since your voidwalker needs all the threat it can get, but works great when juggling mobs.

[The best song to describes classic hype](https://youtu.be/vlVSJ0AvZe0?t=39)
---
Hello there, thanks for the suggestion and sorry for the confusion. She is a gamer, however being mostly a car geek she plays racing sims with me and action  slashers and platformers
---
Hunter if she‚Äôs comfortable with managing a pet. If for PvP, probably mage. 
---
If you dont want to rep grind you can do av for a ram or during aq war effort can easily get the rep
---
One of the best song from the game!
---
Honestly I think she will find something that speaks to her when she loads the game up. My gf is in the same boat (except she basically plays over watch non stop) and I‚Äôm just going to let her pick something when she loads the game up (which will probably be a Druid or hunter lol)
---
Can't be entertaining if he stops streaming lul
---
Warlock. It has two spells for combat with a few mechanics like collecting soul shards from enemies to make health stones and summoning portals. As well as late into classic hitting like a truck.
---
i think i just lost braincells thanks
---
The starting zone won't matter as much as just playing a lot at release. Getting ahead of the pack, no matter the zone, is all that's gonna matter in terms for leveling speed.
---
Can you explain how this works. I saw someone doing multiple ony runs every week but never had any clue how it was done ? Thanks in advance
---
there is absolutely no reason to even talk to someone with such a ridiculous opinion, thats why ; )
---
i'm not here to point out the obvious flaws for brainless people
---
It's worth noting that private servers have inflated rep rewards and so most of the replies you get saying "I was exalted with XYZ before 40" are simply incorrect.  
---
If you want to save money on the runecloth turn in at 60, do IF quests, but just know that no one knows for absolute sure if hitting exalted is possible via quests alone.
---
"YOU'RE BRAINLESS FOR HOLDING A POSITION I DON'T AGREE WITH"
---
Sorry but this sounds like you're the brainless retard with IQ lower than your vanilla character level.
---
it's not even an opinion, you said something factually wrong
---
Not exactly like we have much else to do until classic comes out
---
Do we though?
---
I‚Äôll be interested to see how realms work with launch and what happens if some servers die out. But there will be enough players regardless of these people.
---
Thank you for further demonstrating the depth of your retardation.
---
nope, OBE, untamed blade, spinal reaper, zin rokh will all compete with deathbringer, brutblade, viskag cht etc fine.
---
yep its me
---
Unless she‚Äôs retarded she will be fine playing whatever she likes the look of.
---
Retard.
---
Hi all! I'm very much looking forward to playing a shaman in classic! =)
---
I played a warrior back in the golden days and one thing I disliked quite a bit was the constant respeccing...
---
Farming enough gold to do so takes more time than I believe I'm able to spend this time around.
---
**Is there a viable build that would allow me to heal in dungeons while also being fairly efficient at grinding mobs and doing some casual BGs?**
---
I was thinking about something like this:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPDTM3AABPA9BEA
---
Feedback is higly appreciated! Thanks :)
---
Compete as in objectively worse, but sure. 
---
coming from a guy who can't even use his brain to think of consequences of loot trading, heh
---
If you don't have arrows you can't shoot your bow.

---
Two-hand users rarely can benefit from the skull, but everyone else can equip it in advance (for example the moment they rez at BG gy) and then just swap to their normal off-hand if it isn't applicable when they get in a fight.
---
warriors or ret palas usually do not use it.
---
its very nice on other classes and you can swap it with other weapon/offhand whenever you want.
---
Yes there are the 30s but you do swapping of items in pvp a lot anyway and there will be enough options to use it in the next fight or when you need to keep up with the flag carrier.
---
30 seconds is absolutely an eternity. That's why skull is so important in pvp. You could potentially sit for longer than 30 seconds if a mage chain sheeps, a rogue keeps you sapped, or someone rocket helms or magic dusts you. 
---
You're right that it's less useful on warriors since switching out your 2h requires some incredible timing, but for just about every other class, wsg flagcarriers in druid and mages especially, it's vital. 
---
Yeah, I'm in agreement. Getting exalted at 40 is *not* common nor easy. Getting it by 60 is doable, but generally, OP will need to do some Runecloth turn-ins at 60 to finally hit Exalted.
---
In hindsight it's definitely one of the coolest things I've been a part of. The study written about it is super interesting aswell
---
Thanks for the input, she is mentally healthy.
---
1.) Overall "better" is mage, you want more of them than locks in pvp just because of how valuable frost nova is, they are also much harder to focus target because of ice block/blink. Mage is also better in wpvp, being able to escape nearly every class except for druid if they start having a bad time. 1v1's however go to warlock (more so at high gear levels)
---
2.} Rogues.... Early game mages have a much easier time vs rogues than warlocks, around tier 2 locks are pretty good against rogues (provided they are SL and have VW out, however this isn't the preferred premade spec) again though as a mage if you don't want to fight a rogue there isn't much he can do about it, they have limited ways to remove slows/roots/poly so if you want you can just leave, if you stay and fight you are favored 60:40ish assuming equal skill (although most rogues are bad so its probably closer to 80:20 for average players). SL once it gets good gear is favored probably closer to 90:10, but again its mostly a fun BG random BG spec, most premades expect SM/Ruin, which is more like a 50:50 decently geared.
---
3:) Lock wins unless mage way outskills him, its a long annoying fight if you drag it out as a mage, felhunter gives you spell pushback, on top of 8 sec universal dispel, on top of having a silence/interupt, lock has more health, his CC doesn't always break on damage, curse of tongues makes hard casting extremely risky, and you just don't have the damage to kill him with instants, throw in healing from death coil + CC, drain life, healthstone, spellstone and your gonna have a bad time vs a good warlock. Bad or average warlocks however you can do pretty well against depending on locks spec, let him waste globals putting dots on you, get rid of them with iceblock, get shatters off permafrost, repeat. Lots of locks don't know how to deal with it and if they have bad gear you can win.
---
3.) assuming equal skill, locks are just built to counter casters where mage counters melee. If you are more skilled than the lock you can win for sure but your gonna have to blow every cooldown you have and even then you aren't gonna win every time, but it wildly depends on spec, if you are in a 1v1 with a good SL warlock you are gonna have a bad time, even if they are worse than 
---
agree. i kind of get the feeling that a lot of people are going to be more willing to just play whatever they want, but theres no doubt fear ward is ultra strong
---
STD in STV
---
I agree there will be "enough" players, but I want to see Classic thrive. I want to see it reach the highest numbers the game has ever seen. Apex Legends was a game built almost entirely off streamer influence, the company even payed them to play the game. Only two months into the game and it was 50 million players. They have an influence, a massive one at that, and the top streamers consistently streaming the game is how we will see the most growth.
---
I never once had a calm experience in STV in Vanilla. Ever. No matter when I played. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt believe you re the math, but my goodness, that place. 
---
I love BC and I wouldn't mind going back to that but vanilla is the whole reason this is happening at all. It would be really cool if they went on to create some of the planned content that never made it to vanilla before BC.
---
That was fun *after* auto-wanding was introduced. 
---
Because I got yelled at in Gnomer because I wasn't (manually) wanding. Screw that!
---
I played from release and have never been on private servers. I can't remember virtually anyone getting cross-racial mounts before the War Effort came along. The one exception that sticks out in my memory was a human female character that got a Frostsaber and a GM actually messaged them asking how they got it. Turns out there was a repeatable quest that granted Darnassus rep. I don't believe there were any other quests like that for other factions however. People could get the PvP mounts and that was it until AQ40. Getting exalted with your own faction via quests straight up didn't happen. With another faction? Forget it. People did complain about this a lot on the forums which was why the cloth turn-ins were implemented. 
---
Whichever she likes the most. WoW is an RPG game, so I guess it's better to choose an archetype which is appealing to her (like a holy warrior, or a benevolent healer, or a ranged magical dps casting lightnings, or a pet-lover and tree-hugging elf... whichever tickles her fancy). She'll grasp the class while playing the game. We all were in her shoes one day.
---
This should really be broken up by (PvP horde), (pve horde),(PvP ally),(pve ally).
---
He meant ‚Äûremind‚Äú
---
Do you not enjoy fun?
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter for raiding, only PVP.  In fact, for raiding you want imbalance.  Go look at every live server that is highly progressed.  The vast majority are imbalanced.
---
The best class for a newb is whatever class resonates with them.
---
Get her to watch a couple of classic wow class selection videos on youtube.
---
Personally I think hunter is best for beginners, but you have to learn to manage a pet. If she likes to play casters then mage or warlock are both pretty beginner friendly. Unless she feels a strong draw to any of them I'd say avoid warrior/rogue/druid.
---
You sound like you'll fit in with the alliance faction quite well.
---
thank you! nostalic feels looking at priest t2
---
On top of that the warrior gets no rage because you dodge the auto attacks. 
---
Badlands - save for the instance (and the doomsayer) it is just such a boring place
---
Yeah nah, lots of things go into your dps. 2h fury might be harder but you can 100% outdps dual wielders with those weps and similar gear.
---
Only thing i will concede is dual wield is easier to play and not as reliant on world buffs.
---
I don‚Äôt remember the bag of marbles. Did it work in pvp? 
---
Yes!  I was horrified when I tried BfA. 
---
Yeah, I'm wondering as well. I'll probably be ahead of the pack so I'll have to skip ww at 30, I'm wondering what could be a decent replacement. Thankfully Kargoz's guide talks about other weapons I'm gonna take a look. 
---
Very easily. All the other zones in that level bracket are preferable. 
---
You warrior her Paladin 
---
Her: Alchemy / Herb 
---
You: Mining / ???? 
---
I feel like this would be fun and idk your girl obviously but imo herb is neat and it‚Äôs good to have directly connected professions as to not bog down the leveling experience for a new player.  Enchanting would also be a good one but that‚Äôs a bit more complicated while leveling, but would totally benefit you both. 
---
hard to say since every class except has utility... but since you mention charts, i imagine youre referring more to raids, so if thats the case, id rule rogues straight out of any consideration since they dont have much utility at all vs boss targets
---
i think id vote shamans. ive played shamans multiple times on multiple servers and ive always loved it. resto is the only vanilla healer i enjoy playing! their utility is pretty passive, but shamans are what MAKE horde raiding. on charts, shamans always end up in the same midrange spots because their healing output is mechanically limited. however, the nonstop armor buffs for tanks and totems dictates like half of the fight strategies/positions for horde
---
i know you focus on pve here, but i just adore the ever living heck out of shamans in pvp. frost shock is hilariously strong. poison cleaning totem really lets you annoy hunters and rogues. purge angers EVERYBODY and ruins flag carrying ally druids if you can stay in range of them in conjunction with teammates who stun/slow spam. earthbind totem/rank 1 magma totem complicates flag carrier life tremendously. ghost wolf (especially with rank gear) lets you move the flag in a pinch more effectively than others - every now and then using your trinket -&gt; NS ghost wolf can save a WSG game. grounding sometimes catches important spells. wf totem leads to random roflpwnt clothies from time to time and tremor totem disrupts priest/warrior/warlocks passively... lastly, if youre playing natures swiftness, you have the power to yeet out a nice big heal for teammates in danger
---
all in all, id say shamans and druids (who are prepared to play all specs) are utility kings - both in pve and pvp
---
Thanks for the input, yeah i might be overthinking it with a min max mentality despite the fact i wont be sprinting to the endgame, thanks!
---
You need ammo for ranged abilities and ranged auto attacks. 
---
As the other guy said, no ammo - no shooty.
---
Yo this definitely the correct answer. Idk about the crafting profession while leveling but although hunters are the fastest levelers you need pet macros and a shot timer to use them correctly so I def wouldn't say they're the easiest
---
Thank you all for your comments! Very helpful and all in all the professions or class she chooses should be down to just a hunch or as one user mentioned the likeability of an archetype of a character, thanks again kind community :D!
---
the real thunderfury junior
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=9639
---
too bad it barely does any damage/threat when it procs :(
---
Thousand Needles is probably the worst zone. Azshara could be a close second. Then I'd lump Durotar, Orgrimmar, Feralas, Undercity, and Thunderbluff in there next as absolute aids inducing areas.
---
love the zone because of how lucrative farming the cats is with skinning/lw way before you hit 40. easily ding 40 and being able to afford the mount is beautiful
---
desolace is one of my favorite places in game
---
the kodos of kalimdor travel across the entire continent to join their descendants in death. its beautifully sad, and i think its beautiful that the game world pays at least some attention to the ecology of the game universe
---
I wouldn‚Äôt pigeon-hole her into a class. She really should pick the class that grabs her. Her engagement with the game is much more important than the ease of leveling, especially considering you‚Äôll be dual leveling so it will be relatively easy anyway.
---
That said, in your shoes, I‚Äôd likely steer her away from a warrior.
---
Everything you said is irrelevant or contradicts the intent and purpose of drain tanking 
---
when i first started playing the game, i thought there was no path in. i hadnt done the quest chain that breadcrumbs you out to it. i thought i was just supposed to try to jump down it the best i could
---
:(
---
You'll find it that your kph will be greater if you push fear juggling etc. I personally find it more interactive than drain tanking.
---
  
---
Drain tanking has you also taking more damage and as health is just mana with a step inbetween you'll find your self have less downtime.
---
Rogues can yellow sinister strike ony. I used to be right behind mages in damage on that fight as a rogue
---
now you can get the closure you need for clearing uldaman! the archaedas encounter is truthfully surprisingly difficult if youre in a normal group that doesnt outlevel the rest of the dungeon though..
---
They are? That‚Äôs so cool! I always wanted Vanilla to come back... too bad because most people won‚Äôt go for gear that sucks.2h is bad and tier sets are bad. Class fantasy is dead.

Straight to Video by Mindless Self Indulgence and Dragula by Rob Zombie ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Not really, you'll probably get up to revered pretty easily but once you get out of Loch Modan and the Wetlands, Ironforge rep becomes more sporadic. You'll definitely need to spend some time/gold on runecloth to grind out the last half of revered. 
---
The only professions that provide a guaranteed bonus to all classes/roles are alchemy and engineering (AFAIK).
---
The gathering roles for those could be herb/mining respectively but you could just buy mats (realistically, you could also buy potions so...).
---
I do not think that there are any great BoP leather items from LW (but I could be wrong). 
---
If nothing else, play what you think you will enjoy.
---
Have a look at all the different recipes over at, for example [classicdb.ch](http://classicdb.ch/?spells=11) (you can filter for specific ones, mouse-over the "Professions..."-text at the top).
---
If you're leveling up as a duo, it doesn't matter what she picks. The class most people would dissuade her from would be warrior cause they die a lot early on, but with 2 people, that happens much less. I will suggest that you'll have a bit of healing between you two (not that either of you should play a healing spec, but having heals makes things a lot better in a duo group). Maybe this is the time where you should accommodate to her pick (if you really want to play with her).  
---
Otherwise, what /u/Argantelle said.
---
Dude it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. Realm transfers existed in classic wow
---
Hopefully its not too far off. On LH, I got my Human Warrior to exalted with Darnassus at ~44 by walking to Teldrassil and then doing every Darnassus quest I could find in a classic database. It felt pretty cool to be riding a tiger in my 40s. 
---
It's pretty easy to get run over as a mage if you aren't familiar with the game.
---
Was going to say, always thought the numbers seemed way inflated for rep gains on pservers. Not every quest even gave rep back then. 
---
Off faction exalted before 40 was not a thing in vanilla
---
Yes, it was allowed, here is the vid of a player called Li from French servers back in retail Vanilla : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACM3yXuz0Hw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACM3yXuz0Hw)
---
I guess you're unfamiliar with one particular undocumented server.
---
Because we need more hype
---
Thematically I've always liked herb/alch and it's always going to be beneficial and in demand.
---
You can't go wrong with professions, they're all useful if you enjoy it and want to put in the time.  If you ever plan on tanking 5 mans you'll want enchanting for Smoking Heart of the Mountain as a Druid.  Engineering is the defacto best profession in Classic for everyone.
---
You'll probably level feral, so skinning is a great way to get some copper and you can always drop it later.
---
More real discussion going on in the month of Blizzcon when we got literally 90%+ of the info about Classic that we have?
---
Yeah I wonder why that might be.
---
Tavern by Jason Hayes (I assume it was him).
---
A mellow but insistent tune with some fat notes that go deep, real deep.
---
It has charges (I think 5) and works on pretty much everything.
---
For level 40, true.
---
For level 60? It wasn't that rare at all. It wasn't _common_ but it certainly wasn't difficult either. You just had to spam AV turnins, it gave tons of rep.
---
So all the Salad Bakers players (best Horde guild on ND) are using dual-wield Warriors because it‚Äôs easier? Hmm. 
---
After showing my gf this madseason video: https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE
---
   
---
She decided on going with mage. I think it's a good choice too. Playing frost mage from the start doesn't sound too bad. People always say hunters but honestly, micro'ing a pet can be bothersome to noobs. I personally don't like pets
---
MMO-champion is just constant verbal combat. What is being discussed rarely matters, as there‚Äôs just constant toxic back and forth.
---
You could legit post ‚Äúhey folks, first 100 unique accounts that respond to this post with something positive get $100‚Äù and you‚Äôd still get yelled down/trolled/etc.
---
Less of a place for disucssion than a refuge for trolls that have been kicked off of every factually moderated platform.  
---
How does one lag a zone?
---
If everyone all goes full optimal builds sure, but thats not going to happen.  Also its Onyxia, not exactly the hardest raid.
---
On private servers it is easy.. In the old actual vanilla seeing someone with a cross-faction mount was extremely rare. It could be done, but you pretty much has to do like all the possible quests for a given faction as there were no repeatable quests and rep rewards where really shitty back then... I remember grinding for weeks to get darnassus rep as a dwarf and still only getting revered before I gave up (and I have always been a semi-hardcore gamer that dont give up easily)
---
The time taken that is not part of the normal leveling process is anywhere between 15-30 minutes of extra time depending on RNG.
---
I see. I think ill just go with the gnome mount then, its not too bad but i do like the other ones more.
---
You can't get exalted with Gnomeregan before Alterac Valley or Runecloth turn-ins.
---
Another race that's impossible before that is Darkspear Trolls for horde.
---
There's simply not enough quests that give reputation to those factions. 
---
Especially since, iirc, the rich dad was outed as, essentially, a conman and a liar.
---
As someone that read those books when they were new, I found them comical. Their advice was arguably applicable to boomer era Americans, but wholly inapplicable to any generations after that. 
---
E.g. no one from 2002 onward could buy a second home, as a rental property, just by cutting some extraneous expenses like eating out. Which was essentially the type of advice he had in his books. 
---
I just got my fianc√© into WoW, we started on a private server and found she had a blast playing mage. I played a prot warrior.  It went really well, did dungeons to 60 which took awhile, but was a blast 
---
Would be pretty awesome if they did
---
though they would probably troll and make it PVE
---
you know not the REAL experience
---
MAKE NIGHT TIME DARK AGAIN
---
I'm sure it's something they will consider if they really are try to trying to make classic as realistic as possible, which seems to be 70% the case. Classic with classic weather would be optimal but honestly If they just got the darkness right I would be cool with it
---
Action slashers? Like Diablo? Then you can probably explain a few of the classes in Vanilla using Diablo talk.
---
Or just let her read up on her own, see what peaks her intrests.
---
As for my recommendation, probably hunter even though you have to micro ammo and pet happiness.
---
Of the particular 3 big undocumented servers, according to their stats right now
---
1 - 53.6% A / 46.4% H
---
2 - 50.7% A / 49.3% H
---
3 - 50% A / 50% H
---
What benefits does alchemy bring that you can't buy on the AH?
---
Download 1.12 wow. You can make your own server or register on some private server. Enjoy character creation.

I mean...I don't know man...seems a non-issue.
---
Sure, it would be great to have a realm list before Classic goes live, but I don't see any problem if we don't get it. There is no problem at all to talk to your friends before starting to play Classic. Waiting 10 minutes or 1 hour or even 1 day after launch is NOT a big deal, especially if you want to avoid playing on a different realm than your friends.
---
It is something we should talk about and bring attention to though as I've only seen it mentioned not very much by the community so far
---
no shooty - no booty
---
No booty - no tooty
---
There's absolutely no way the one with a direction and a synonym for valley in the name is that close to perfect balance. Most zones are massively Alliance controlled, and you can also see it in how many guilds clear AQ40.
---
herbalism alchemy is ideal for a druid. not only is it among the most profitable combinations, as a cat you can stealth past enemies to reach herbs like ghost mushroom that only grow in caves (and mostly in a cave  full of elites. )  But also just outdoors, if two people spot a herb at the same time, the one who doesn't get aggro will pick it up most of the time.

Other "less preferably" zones are unpleasant at worst, but there is nothing that annoying than wasting 2 hours of walking back and forth in STM.  Even the quests are just meh.

I agree with this post. I‚Äôm getting my girlfriend into classic as well. She‚Äôs an avid D&amp;D player and likes playing classes that can heal, so I recommended priest for her. I‚Äôd just show your girl all the classes and let her pick for herself.
---
If they want to keep classic going for forever will the time between patches needs to be bigger? Or will they come at a normal pace and after naxx the game will just float there indefinitely
---
There is a classic wow dressing room on wowhead I think
---
And then it was made just as dark as vanilla in a later expansion...
---
And yes, we will get the lighting and weather that was in vanilla.

And it is not using the MoP "engine", but is based on the client as it existed during Legion.

https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9rpbic/1121_vs_demo_client_night_time_screenshot/

In my experience this subreddit tends to attack opposing engagement pretty heavily. Even if your not directly opposing them. While I am excited for classic such a high level of echo chamber is dangerous to a game. 
---
Is creating your own server complicated?
---
You can pick herbs in stealth and it doesn't break? Hmm real good to know 
---
Yeah. Noticably missing the Lordaeron Fog, Tanaris dust storms, Dun Morogh snow, Wetlands Rain and Duskwood dark fog; all the intense weather effects. Maybe those were harder to trigger than just running around the zones, though.

Felwood and silithus

Absolutely, by miles, everything has so many helpful comments on it, I always have this tab open

so similar to the really sticky glue

no

Tailoring and Enchanting is always a good combo but those can be hard on money too, depends what you think is worth it and will get satisfaction out of. I'd say you should pick up cooking and fishing too if you can put the time into it.

---
Unless I missed something in BFA, you can only see a rough idea of the quests done in each area via the achievement tracker, and achievements aren't gonna be in classic, so probably not.

Might be a good idea to install Questie which should show every quest on your world map.

Weather is not decided yet and there is probably a good reason for it. the new Weather 2.0 is really nice, it just is rarely used on max settings, probably due to performance and isn't the default. Classic can run on a toaster and they could really push it. They have sandstorms, volumetric clouds and it can be set as intense as vanilla WoW.

IMO they look stupidly better than the horrible filters which people use sweetfx to try to get rid of on private servers anyways. The rain intensity in vanilla is awesome and so is the lightning. Lighting can be set exact. 
---
I'm still hoping we get the AV version where we used to have battles that went on for hours instead of 10 minutes. Where you had to collect the items and summon the NPCs to win, and not rush through to the boss without a proper fight. The whole epicness and fun of AV was lost at some point when they patched it to death.

As a druid, if you ever think you want to bear form and tank anything, I'd suggest Enchanting to 265 to get your BIS trinket ([smoking heart of the mountain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11813/formula-smoking-heart-of-the-mountain#teaches-recipe)), then drop enchanting for something else, or keep it if you plan on being your guild enchanter. And by plan on being your guild enchanter, I don't mean; "Yeah I'll be the guild enchanter!", and more of it's already been planned on you being the guild enchanter so you get the raid drops. And with that, you need to do a lot of outside world farming for low drop enchants. Otherwise, it's pointless.
---
Skinning/LW can make you HEAPs of gold if you're one of the first. If you plan on pvping at all, and especially as a druid running flags, then I'd suggest engineering 100%.
---
If I decide on druid over rogue, then I'll be doing skinning/enchanting, then dropping skinning for engineering, fwiw.
---
Wish I could upvote this 100 times.
---
Weather effects are client side, and only 2 locations were ready for demo, others were left in unfinished state (some buildings in Tanaris missed textures, for example). At least I hope you see that day/night cycle is identical to 1.12 client.
---
The server I'm talking about is ~2k concurrent players at peak, ~600 concurrent during off hours.
---
Same, pretty much. It all comes down to aesthetics for me. If I play a game for multiple /played days, I want my character and environnement to look nice. 
---
nono, don't pick the gnome one!  it's a filthy, oil leaking, air polluting menace!  I love gnomes, but this invention of them...  bah! bah! bah!  Actually I suspect it really is a goblin invention, must be an evil plot by the Steamwheedle Cartel to poison the alliance, they somehow gave the plans for these diabolic machines to the gnomes, knowing their soft spot for tinkering...  
---
Anyway, as a young gnome, you will know how important it is to protect the environment. so chose a biological mount is the right choice! Bravo!  A dwarven mount will be reachable, but the easiest one will be the human mount.  To accomplish this you will have to leave your home at a very young age and travel to the lands of Elwynn.  Spend your youth and teenage years among the humans and you will amass a great reputation, all humans like the little folk.   
---
Why humans, you say, and not Night elves?    well, there are a lot more humans in the world, they breed like rabbits I think.  So you will have far more chances to gain a high reputation.  On top of that humans are needy , and acroos the world some humans have repeatable quests, like  Quartermaster Lungertz in Nethergarde Keep. He keeps losing his supplies and wil reward you endlessly if you track them down for him.  (Note, this might feel like bringing water to the sea, so I would not encourage it, but it IS a possibility and you might use it for those final steps towards your noble steed. )
---
There is also a farmboy named Gerard that is always thirsty , he will speak fondly of you if you bring him refreshing spring water, but it's unclear if this will be registered with the magistrates of Stormwind.  
---
Mage is the most faceroll class on a pve server in a duo probably. It just has a high cap in pvp. Hunters have the hardest ranged rotation. 
---
I wouldn't touch a mage if she wants to do pvp or you are on a pvp server and she will sometimes be alone though. Lock is the best choice there because they still have a faceroll raiding rotation like a mage. Hunters don't. Hunters, feral druids have the hardest rotations. Priests are the hardest healerrs, MT's take a lot of work and warriors should only be played if you are a hardcore player anyways. Not because they are hard, but because they are gear dependent.
---
Before 20-30 just alternate two zones and finish in Westfall to do DM and it's quests. Should be like 21 ish.
---
Do this guide for 20-30.

Warrior changes to Battle Stance to use Overpower

An actually good rogue: *Enjoy a full duration Gouge, buddy*
---
i think it does break, but you can always (like in &gt;90%) find that safe spot to pick it, it's more the steps reaching that exact spot that you need stealth for. 
---
theres an ungoro quest item named spirit of aquamentas or something like that and its preraid bis for casters
---
Truth. Too many people on this sub think that they'll sell &lt;x&gt; BoE blue/purple for hundreds or thousands of gold.  
---
*laughs in fresh economy*
---
Wtf
---
&gt; Voidwalker's mana will last far longer if torment is manually used a limited number of times each mob since this will give it a lot more time outside the five second rule to regen
---
I think this is the most important part, whatever you do, OP, remember this line.
---
I remember the first time I did drugs
---
Thanks for your reply, but isnt the command ‚Äú/run IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(12345)‚Äù available in retail? You can insert the quest ID to check the status.
---
Unfortunately questie buggs out sometimes during my current leveling and we are not aware of the restrictions of addons for classic (and if one like questie is going to be available).
---
No, but logging in to a private server is extremely simple.
---
During retail Vanilla WoW, a gnome got a horse mount before the cloth turn-in quests were implemented.
---
Even the Blizzard devs were surprised thinking it wasn't possible. It made it as a bit of news on the official WoW website.
---
This was back during retail WoW.
---
&gt; kodos of kalimdor travel across the entire continent to join their descendants in death.
---
Until they're mind-controlled into servitude by a goblin, anyway.
---
there are fun servers with gear vendors and instant 60
---
I think the best way to handle loot trading would be:
---
Master loot can be traded freely
---
Greed loot can be traded freely
---
Need loot can only be traded to the next highest roll (or freely if there is none)
---
I‚Äôve tried to find addon for that for a long time but I don‚Äôt think there is one. What I‚Äôve been doing is open all the quests on new tabs from a database online and bookmark them. Then as I complete a quest I delete the bookmark so then I can see which ones I still have left to do
---
So many iconic 2-handers in classic that are so badass though.  The rogues already gotta battle the hunters for 1hers, don't make em battle warriors too! ;)
---
I remember leveling a prot war and I get this 40ish epic shield
---
I could really have used it but then I see its worth like 200g in AH so ...
---
And sapper
---
They've done a lot of work to make the Legion client Classic WoW look like true Vanilla WoW.
---
I'm sure they're not ignorant of the fact that the weather effects are very important to the classic experience of Vanilla WoW.
---
The real questions are, is there enough community voice showing this is a very desired feature, and is Activision Blizzard going to give the dev team enough time and resources to make it happen?
---
This pic needs to be modified to have "/train" all over him.
---
Choo choo bitch
---
At 29, corpse maker, unless you get lucky with boe. You got ravager next in armory. Following that, if you really want to, you got uladaman to farm... To the last boss... Which is very long.
---
From 40 onwards I think there's a drought of obtainable weapons that don't require a long farm (long dungeons) and if your ahead of the pack your most likely to skip alot of dungeons. Especially when you reach the 50 or 45 mark, I imagine it can be difficult to find groups.. If you are ahead of the pack that is.
---
I'd recommend searching quest rewards, look for anything better than the ravager :) 
---
Just taunt the mobs noob
---
Sleep sand?
---
Was that a thing? I remember a quest reward item that would sleep an opponent and it was special because it ignored level differences.
---
The directional valley server is very alli heavy, like 70/30 at least at 60 and even higher ratio of alliance guilds clearing AQ40
---
God I hate emojis. 
---
No he meant rewind wtf
---
Is it important to have a list? yes
---
Is it important right now? Hell fucking no.
---
Dude theres like 3-5 months until classic, we don't need more than a couple weeks notice with realmlist jesus.
---
Locomotive Breath - Jethro Tull
---
Something about the flute solo reminds me of STV or something. It‚Äôs sick. 
---
It is not worth it to move at all.
---
Have more than 40 people exist in it all casting spells at once. Streamers have actually gotten temp banned for organizing indefinite 40 man raids on cities because the server can't handle it.
---
The Piccolo of Flaming Fire
---
No MC run is complete without one.
---
TBH depends what kind of walljumping you refer to.
---
The oldschool where you could straight up jump up a wall like swifty showcased in his vid? No.
---
The small kind of jumps? Well they are possible on private servers because the jumps are purely just how the map works not using glitches with jumping. I could see some of these being possible in vanilla but we don't know.
---
PVE is like 50% real experience 
---
Hence multiple alts
---
dunno Im still really torn
---
warriors are cool as fuck all through the game but you cant play it casually I think? I know some of their preraid bis are expensive as hell and their repairs will be a huge money sink and Im not convinced by their gold farming potential. I suspect some guilds wont even accept you without shit like lionhart helm, titan legs, the gloves with+skill or even if you arent human/orc for the stupid racials.
---
rogues are always fun and always look cool but its tryhard almost as warrior
---
I also like mages halfway between tryhard and looking cool and fun but I wonder if I should bite the bullet and go for what Id really like even if its a bitch to play? dont wanna give up on it midway then
---
palas got a really sweet looking t2 and special cheap mount but until then you play like a priest
---
hunter is tempting but Im worried I will fuck up kiting or whatever they have to do
---
I'm sure, I believe it became trinketable when they changed the PVP trinkets to all be the same and remove all cc effects, but I think that happened in BC (I didn't play my warlock much in BC).  If you're able to trinket a deathcoil on a pserver then it sounds like they have either the spell or the trinket coded incorrectly.
---
How much do you PVE
---
Least favourite for questing: Silithus
---
Least favourite aesthetically: Silithus
---
Yes an arrow/shell is consumed for each of those abilities
---
I think they had a hidden mechanic giving players a "suggested" realm to play on back in the day that would help players pick less populated or newer servers over the older overpopulated ones.
---
Hahaha, not my video but yeah, looked like something of the sorts.
---
Yeah, Lost Anarchy!
---
I think Joana on Joanasworld will be releasing his Alliance 1-60 on Classic's Beta Launch. 
---
Currently using the Horde guide and it is fantastically quick.
---
Couldn't agree more with u. I'm in the same boat for warriors.. rogues i like them but not convinced i'll enjoy them fully..
---
Mages never actually considered but might look into it more.
---
Hunter is what i played back in vanilla wow and i remember loving the class however as they are the easiest to level i assume there's real comp getting into a group? Can't remember how i found it first time around..
---
Paladins i played from TBC to WOTLk and loved healing, pvp and pve.. not sure how they are as healers in classic?
---
Also the farming gold aspect i consider strongly due to me not having as much time to play as back in the days.. and i'll prolly be casual..
---
Hahaha, glad you liked it.
---
You do realize how stupid you sound, right? You are comparing 11 days with 4 days TIME PLAYED. 
---
But maybe you just don't understand the difference.
---
To be able to hit lvl 60 in 96 hours played, a player HAVE TO HAVE a lot of rested XP bonus.
---
The rested XP bonus is really complicated, because it only applies to XP granted by killing mobs, and not quest. resting for 8 hours in a city inn grants 5% of the current XP level as a rested XP bonus.
---
Assuming a player can play non-stop (and hence, never to benefit from the rested XP bonus), he will hit lvl 60 in roughly 120 hours, in perfect conditions (no deaths, lucky weapon and gear upgrades, use of consumables, etc.).
---
No matter how nerdy a player is, he is still human. The most he can play, continuously, is 18 hrs/day, and even that is a big stretch. He'll probably be dead or hospitalized after 5 days of playing 18 hrs/day. And by playing I mean continuously playing, not being AFK in Orgrimmar 6 hrs out of those 18.
---
Even playing 18 hrs /day, such a cyborg of a player will still need almost a calendaristic WEEK to hit lvl 60.
---
Now, back to the guy that hit lvl 60 in 11 days in Vanilla. That guy still needed 120 hrs (or a bit more) of /played. And that means that he played roughly 11-12 hours / day for 11 days straight.
---
Playing 12 hrs/day (actively playing, again, not AFK-ing in Orgrimmar) for 10-12 days is IMPOSSIBLE for 99.99% of the players. You got to be suicidal to do that. 
---
Anyway, I hope you understand that 11 calendaristic days is not the same as 4 days played.
---
On retail can see exactly which quests you have completed in-game using [API_GetQuestsCompleted](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_GetQuestsCompleted).
---
You can also use the [Battle.net API](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/api-reference/world-of-warcraft-community-api) to access the data outside the game.
---
Well, if you don't want sharding, just wait a few days
---
5 days and 12 hours TIME PLAYED.
---
Which is probably 10-12 days in real time.
---
The same as the guy in Vanilla.
---
Mage or Paladin
---
she actually watched that 1hour  video? xd
---
Ok, your argument is fair, but my challenge to you is: has Blizzard offered, mentioned, hinted, or even thought about releasing 1.0? The answer is NO! What they have decided on is 1.12, which is the best we‚Äôre going to get. In this case, I‚Äôll take what I can get, unaltered, as close to original as is possible. If the option existed for 1.0, I‚Äôd be making this same argument for it. 
---
\+1
---
Joana will still need like 10-11 days in real time to lvl to 60 in under 4 days PLAYED TIME.
---
&gt; Mages never actually considered but might look into it more.
---
my only problem with that is that Shatter talent is so great for pvp but its complicated as hell to fit it into a pve spec
---
Well WE watched it, but yeah I skipped almost half the classes, druid, shaman, &amp; paladin. Same chick will play stardew for 10 hours sometimes, I figure WoW would be a good game for her
---
Furthermore, I haven‚Äôt asked them to add anything to the game that wasn‚Äôt there in the first place. I oppose any changes that are outside of original Blizzard content,  or the changes that they implemented in the natural progression of the game, so your argument is moot, to be honest... Nice try though!
---
Don't worry 99% of your gameplay will be static auto shooting to proc your aspect of the hawk. In which you continue auto attacking. 
---
Most likely, it wasn't uncommon at all to constantly find the same people doing that route (the ones that were on your pace) and at launch masses would be waiting for specific quests to follow the guide. It's an amazing resource but for a launch like this it's just a resource and likely one of the guides out there that isn't worth follow specifically for the first like 20 levels unless you outpace the zergrush quick
---
It‚Äôs too bad these types of items aren‚Äôt craftable after finishing the quest. There‚Äôs a quest in red ridge that rewards you with fishliver oil, it‚Äôs one of the few consumables that increase attack speed. 
---
That isn't necessarily the case at all, I've tried grinding IF rep on pservers. Some factions like org, SW, and darnassus are easy to get up to exalted due to the amount of quests available at low levels.
---
I love the snow and I love the forest. I‚Äôm not one for swamps or barren landscapes.
---
This is probably why I play alliance.
---
I don't know Elendril personally but I do know I personally got a hold of this video 10 days before that TCG was released. Maybe the TCG hero was named after him?
---
11 days IN REAL TIME !!!
---
NOT 11 DAYS PLAYED !!!
---
5 days PLAYED TIME requires 10-12 days REAL TIME, be it Vanilla or private servers or Classic.
---
That would be badass
---
It's difficult to say since we don't know which patch Blizz will go with when it comes to rep gain. Make sure you do all available IF quests when you're at the right level because in vanilla the rep gets redacted along with exp. IF is one of the more difficult reps to grind though and depending on the patch, it might be impossible before cloth turn-ins.
---
BGs at start please!
---
Ah true, they did go to other zones. 
---
[deleted]
---
"not as bad as I think" and incredibly worse than the alternatives are different things.  There is no reason to DW fury until later in the game.
---
I think this video is quite clever with how similar it is to the original music video for this song. Of course the original music sparked numerous other memes. I actually like it.
---
It's quite the difference between retail cross realm LFR and classic realm locked dungeons. People will struggle to find groups if they are a ninja. There's also a huge time commitment to classic so you won't get just random kids that jump in to the game and ninja for a few dungeons.
---
Finally any new!  I love the idea of them bringing it out slowly.  Now when is the release date?!
---
I think back then you earned rage every tick in combat anyway.
---
Still nice to get Assassin's blade at level 22 from lockboxes. Free 10 gold.
---
Just play a moonkin if you want to play one
---
Would it work to macro pet attack and torment to the same button to save hotkey space?
---
Yeah, you will spend 4-5 hours leveling Dom 1 to 10 and 20 hours leveling from 10-20
---
Honestly, after experiencing 14k realm population on some pservers I honestly hope realms will not have such a massive load, but then again they did bring up sharding specifically to counter that, so I guess it doesn't matter how many people play on a server you'll only ever seen a set amount of players in any given zone even if the entire server is there.
---
To be fair I also think 2k is too low an amount these days, that realm with 14k pop at launch now has an average of 6k population around the clock and it feels great tbh , not a clusterfuck at all and good activity going on in every zone so you never feel like you're the only person in a zone when playing in the mornings or late night , but that's a massive drop from it's original population and I fear if blizz limits server to something like 2k at launch that number will dwindle and end up in the hundreds a few months later, that's pretty much a dead server tbh and blizzard will have to resort to realm transfers or merges/cross faction to solve those issues and I'd rather not see that tbh.
---
hire the hurricane guy to do them and they will be siiiick 
---
Weather is server side. Of course they didn't have any weather anywhere because the hacked together servers they used didn't have it. :P
---
I mean... They COULD
---
Warlock, the only class where it‚Äôs nice to have KTM soloing.
---
pvp wise paladin is far superior. Its much harder to take advantage of wf totem in a bg. Not to mention paladin blessings and single target heals are superior to shaman. 
---
Honestly all it really should come down to is which faction you want to play. Since horde cant have paladins, and alliance cant have shamans. I feel like this is the biggest factor in the decision. Pick a race/faction that you enjoy and then play whatever class is associated.
---
I think a lot of people underestimate how many people will  *flock* to the unbalanced servers (to the dominant faction) just to have a bigger playerbase, less chance of getting ganked, etc.  Servers like Kel'thuzad, Mal'Ganis (iirc?), etc were all that way before, and once they got their reputations it only ever got worse.
---
90% will be sticking with hunters in that case.. tbh mages are probably always welcomed in a party.. due to CC and food/drink
---
Mage was the "anyone can pick up and play" class.
---
Or so a class designer said in an interview.
---
Most people think battlegrounds will make PvP super rare or something.
---
I personally want to do some low level battlegrounds without twinks. That's only possible at the start.
---
What about hunter?
---
Well they did have that job opening for a long time that specifically said they were looking for people who could restore the looks of the game to that of vanilla down to how shaders worked in vanilla. They even mentioned old weather effects and everything so that does give me hope.
---
On vanilla servers, the other guy is probably talking about TBC servers.
---
And creating/adjusting one? Is one also able to create an offline client just for themselves? While maybe editing the map and or quests?
---
alright, ill admit that after leveling like 15 billion characters i didnt know about that last one at all. the cove, fortunately, i found out one day while collecting steelbloom :D noticed that there was the path
---
that 14 slot is super useful
---
I didn‚Äôt think of the no twinks at the start which would be awesome!  I just want to WSG!  But now that you said no twinks I am even more hyped lol. 
---
Skinning and sell to vendor. 
---
Oh yeah, I remember Andorhal in early classic WoW where the mob density was so high that doing the quests there solo was painful. I believe in one of the later patches, they lowered the mob density which made it much better.
---
People are acting like retail is anything to go by. There will actually be server community in classic, and the people who spend hundreds of hours to actually level to 60 will for the most part be passionate fans with patience. The retail people who only want to do a few quick dungeons and get some epics won't even make it past WC after they have corpse ran across the barrens a few times due to several misses and parries against a harpy. 
---
Spot on! Love it!
---
Still I believe it's a good idea to put her on a healer, you will naturally be in the lead and she will always feel useful, even if she doesnt understand everything. If she doesnt like the idea though, dont be afraid to experiment.
---
Whataboutism?
---
 What do other streamers have to do with his entertainment factor? 
---
Regardless, the biggest thing he does is react to other people's content. So how about every other person he has ever "reacted" to? Becausing "reacting" to someone else isn't entertainment, it's borderline plagiarism. 
---
Just watch the other people's damn videos yourselves and form your own opinions instead of having his ideas spoon fed to you (assuming you watch).
---
no, you shouldn't ditch TG, leveling in the zone you spawn is the most efficient. 
---
also durotar is the most crowded, cos it got 2 races.
---
also durotar got the most inconvinient lay out of terrain, with all the caverns multiple levels and such. 
---
when mulgor or tg are just flat glades, with mobs standing everywhere. very convinient with pathing, or grinding.
---
if anything being in tg could give you some xp bump, cos you can do tirisfal glades shit and then catch up and do a few 10+ level quests and delivery quest in durotar/orgri on your way to barrens. and that xp bump gonna be very helpful later.
---
when if you are an orc and start in durotar no way you won't go out your way to tirisfal galdes for some quests.
---
On the contrary, I'd derive far more entertainment from never his dipshit REACTION videos in suggestions ever again than I'd derive from a single second of his continued streaming. 
---
Yeah calling bull on this one. 
---
I think the smallest number wipe i remember was a couple hundred health in vanilla mc. Forget the boss but still.
---
Something like that drops from the rare elementals in Westfall.
---
You heard wrong. Devilsaur gloves and pants on release will be worth more than you.
---
Are we not all adults with jobs here? What's  $15?
---
Laughs in Paladin :)
---
Considering that DM won't be available on release hunters are going to be the kings of gold farming for a while. They can efficiently farm Maraudon princess runs, which is around 50g per hour purely from vendoring drops, the moment they hit 60 and that will give them a lot of purchasing power.
---
Leveling with skinning will generate a lot of vendor money.
---
See now you're just brown-nosing OP kappa.
---
On a more serious note, OP fucked up when he assumed what other people's feelings are about blizzard.
---
Well I think I‚Äôm worth more so I‚Äôll call that one persons opinion
---
0) save basically every trinket you get. luffa, mark of the chosen, the horde 1% hit thing, the 1% dodge trinket, nifty stopwatch, etc.
---
1) magic dust if you get any while leveling in westfall. can really give you the edge you need on tough elite group quests
---
2) the uldaman rocket helm thing if youre fortunate enough to get it as horde
---
3) coldridge daggers or whatever theyre called from razorfen if youre a melee
---
4) the warrior class quest chest
---
5) the BOE agi legs you can find in gnomer if youre an agi using class because those things will last you basically until endgame 5 mans
---
6) MURLOC NETS FROM WESTFALL MURLOCS ARE SUPER OP ANTI-GANKING COUNTERMEASURES
---
7) the stealth boots or parachute cape from the rogue class quest chain IF you choose one over the head
---
8) the offhand from the early druid class quest can be useful in a pinch, so it might be worth holding
---
I mean you as a druid. I can't equate human life to video games.
---
Only with arms talent anger management
---
Oh wow not bad at all. And I guess enchanting helps you with the money early on?
---
But was it?  Tichondrius was a launch server and PVP.
---
&gt; 1: Warlocks are very gear-dependent, yo 
---
This is much more true for end game raids and to an extent, BGs. Every other aspect of the game- leveling, PvE farming, and (w)pvp, warlocks do not need much gear at all to decimate other players. It feels unfair how strong a SL warlock is in 1v1, truly. 
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea tbh. Seems like I am going to create a Google Doc containing all available quests and a link to the database. Additionally I am going to implement a possibility to mark them as completed in this sheet.
---
Mine's always gone by the time I get through stone talon, f'ing alliance.
---
I don't know what you are saying because I am not sure what you think I am saying. Yelling at people without context doesn't help.
---
Let's all meet in Ysondre then.. that's what I did in cataclysm.
---
In EU too? I might've remembered wrong and it was "second to last", point is it was chosen by its location in the alphabetical order, not by its name.
---
What do y‚Äôall think will he the minimum character length for names in Classic? I‚Äôm hopping for 2 but doubt it. 3 would be cool too, but I fear it‚Äôll be 4.
---
This.  Taking an overpower is better than getting hit with the crit MS, crit white number, hamstring, and probably overpower anyway. 
---
One hand + shield is worse. 
---
Its more fun than 2h.
---
Scantly clad female nightelf dancing in Stormwind.
---
They showed screenshots of being able to jump under stormwind, some wall jumps will still be in 
---
No, most people did NOT want to play the game like a naxx raider, because it takes dedication and mental stam. You can do it with responsibilities but your really crunching your daily hours probably even need time off work.
---
Even if I was jobless it would take serious dedication/mental stam to play as much as you needed to for rank 14. That was just stupid on blizzards part as far as the pvp grind goes. Something I'm ok with them changing tbh. 
---
Classic wow hasn‚Äôt been released. Are you talking about Vanilla?
---
What about the quest on the left side of thandol span in a nook?
---
The fuck are you smoking? Are you memeing right now?

Positive? THERE ARE LITERALLY POSTS ON THE FRONT PAGE RIGHT NOW saying "what about dead servers?" there are multiple posts saying doom is coming if we have loot trading. Supportive? People who want even small changes and people who want no changes constantly belittle and shit on each other, sniping at each other any chance they get. Optimistic? Come on. 
---
lol the point is that LT can be used to keep a drop from a pugger who should get it, and it can also be used to keep a drop from from a pugger who's trying to ninja it.
---
In every situation, all you have to do is change the motivation of the pugger and suddenly LT becomes good or bad.
---
It's neutral
---
Elemental shaman is still incredibly strong burst with just preraid BiS. They just lack cc compared to a mage.
---
FOR. THE. ALLIANCE!!! 
---
Weird bc streamers didnt exist in vanilla wow and zones had far more than 40 ppl in it. Get your sensationalist unfounded bullshit out if here. 
---
In 2005-06 or on a private server?
---
Yeah it's sad really. The opposing (non dominant) faction has a zero chance at killing world bosses when stuff like this happens. The kids that flock to dominant servers (KT/Tich/Illidan/Area52/etc) are cancer. I hope a system is implemented where if it gets to be like 60/40 or more then a huge queue system is added to the dominant faction on that server to bring it back down to at least 55/45.

When he did that record, he slept something like 4 hours a day, so no, the real life time was not 3 times played time, or even double.
---
You have two options:
---
* Reroll a new character, for free, on any server you want
---
* Pay to transfer an existing character to any server you want
---
Those are the options and have been for over 10 years. If you don't like them, then don't play because Blizz isn't going to change them.
---
Boy you seem to be confused.
---
I said ‚Äòmost‚Äô - with the info we have and with how easy it is to obtain that info about class builds, pre-BiS etc. a minority will go 2h. And Guilds will probably push for dw because of how much easier it is to get good dps with it.
---
Easy Donald
---
At the end of the day, a lot of Classic is about comfyness, and Horde loses ten times over on that subject.
---
People still say that it's crazy. The time you started isn't important.
---
I think the number of up- and downvotes speak for themselves.
---
No mana issues with growl, you just pewpew while the pet keeps aggro. 
---
Frost video again üòéüîù
---
Well please come back and share that with us.  I'm in the same boat and many quests are tricky, drop off mobs etc.  :)
---
Yeah I had a Human warrior called 'Le' it was good because if you typed /who le then you'd get 50+ results every time 
---
I would LOVE new cinematics for the old content. That‚Äôs a ‚Äòchange‚Äô I would in favour for.

For me it was always the people you met in it, and still is today

Back in the day it was Alakazhamz

Hopefully it comes back xD

I think I did the riddle quest. I didn‚Äôt even know the wrath I quest chain existed. That place is well hidden. 
---
He's not retail. He's Classic.
---
You can have a macro that toggles torment auto-cast on when you send your pet to attack a new mob. Then after seeing that the voidwalker has used however many torments you need for it to hold threat you can press the same macro button to toggle it off to allow it to regen mana until the next mob.
---
This is the answer. Hunters will have the easiest time right away, but that‚Äôs only useful if you want to play a Hunter. It‚Äôs not worth leveling a Hunter alt first just for the gold perk.
---
Hi, /u/JoelHDarby
---
What's so bad about being on a server that a streamer also plays on?
---
i wanted to make this meme but was too lazy...i upvoted
---
What about the hundreds of characters all in the cities at the same time? Server can handle that just fine
---
I mean, you have to use common sense here since you probably won't get the best methods leaked to you by the people that knows them. But a hint is to make some research into items that people will NEED at 60.
---
While leveling just loot everything you can and sell it as soon as you are near a vendor to free up bag space. You can also skin/mine/herb, sell what you skin to vendors and sell the things you mine or herb on AH. At 60 you can just remove skinning, mining or herbing(whatever two professions you picked) depending on what you want to keep. 
---
But like I said, the better methods won't get leaked simply because people want to keep it to themselves (me included), but you can find out about it if you do some heavy researching.
---
Yeah, to be fair - I played both Vanilla Retail and Nost.  I thought the population got way too out of hand on Nost towards the final months of it, but at the same time: god it's such a great feeling knowing there's tons of people on at any given time.
---
A lot of people seem to have mispelled "the barrens".
---
At 40 not. At 60 via rune cloth rep or AV exalted. 
---
My gf (new to gaming) has tried a couple of classes and said that she would recommend mage or druid.
---
The number of characters/accounts, which is measureable, is fairly even.
---
The number of active players is nowhere near even.
---
Unless you can level to 60 within the week and farm devilsaurs, then it‚Äôs demo worth it
---
This
---
The only addition to grinding skins and basic loot from mobs is rogue's pickpocketing. You might want to get an alt, lvl it to pickpocket and just farm yellow humanoids in starting location :)
---
I know, right?
---
I only started playing WoW during BfA but my opinions about Vanilla are just as valid and my knowledge about it is just as extensive.
---
All completely possible.
---
&gt;Weather is server side
---
Source for this claim? Many others have said it's client side. I recall seeing rain once and my friend not seeing it, and relogging and seeing the weather gone.
---
Frost this is awesome, I love these hard to find/off the beaten path quests. Thank you for making this, I will definitely get that 14 slot bag
---
Subreddit is alright, but wait until you get to play the game. The vanilla community is probably the best i've been part of, osrs is pretty good too but I feel like vanilla brings out the good guys and girls in the game.
---
Well if people weren't so awkward it would be easier for them. People who play mmorpgs come in many varieties.. mostly socially awkward. Group finders helped solidify their isolation though.
---
That's a hidden one too.
---
Definitely. I remember I met someone playing during my first week and played with them through my first level 60. Then we rerolled a new server and both hit 60 again. 
---
Raided all throughout MC and then he went all out in pvp. I played with him throughout my entire vanilla experience, played more with him than with my RL friends. 
---
One day he never logged on again with no notice...
---
Greenfox, you out there?
---
maybe if you are lucky, you will find him on: https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
The weather effects are client side obviously. The weather itself is server side. (See for example: https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/master/src/server/game/Weather)

Old Thing Back - Matoma and the Notorious B.I.G. 
---
Perfectly balanced...as all things should be
---
This pic is so cute
---
Ninjas will never trade an item back to people they took it from, this does not combat that issue.  This system incentivizes ninjaing because it allows for collusion in groups.  People accidentally rolling on items they don't need is less likely than people using a loot system that allows for them to increase their odds of success without punishment.
---
Very good answer, yeah rogues back then didn't had cloack of shadows that is why they are probably "easier" to deal with.
---
On the other hand, it is really difficult to decide, i get it now, mage can deal with melee and lock with casters but it seems lock can deal with casters too if he goes the ubber tank spec... how does mage do with the other classes?, like the other casters and hunter? does lock deal with them better?
---
RetroWoW is good
---
Warrior for sure
---
Or killing random whelps that spawn
---
There is also farming, everyone says mage can makes shit ton of gold by mobbing, and honestly mobbing in any game is just really fun for me. But jesus just dealing damage and healing at the same time, putting dots on enemies and killing them hopelessly is just to fun too...
---
My roommates guild years ago had the server first for illidan. Basically the whole raid wiped and it was just some else shaman left spamming lightning bolt when illidan simultaneously killed the shaman and died. 
---
It was hilarious since illidan ‚Äúdied‚Äù but didn‚Äôt drop loot OR respawn since they died at the same time. Took them like a week for blizzard to analyze the situation and divi out the loot for them. 
---
I can agree with Warrior &amp; Druid but why rogue?
---
Sup Asmongold
---
For me, it was easy.
---
I will play the same main from Vanilla.
---
Didn't even considered another option.
---
But, I am conservative by nature.
---
That‚Äôs not the point, I‚Äôm not saying it was good or bad, just reminiscing about a time in the games history. 
---
closest ive had to that was in pvp where my warlock dies then the other player dies from dots.
---
Yeah, I love fear juggling mobs, it's the reason I am planning on rolling warlock in the first place. Mage and hunter can chew through a lot of mobs really quickly as well, but the way they do it feels so clunky compared to the way warlocks do it.
---
A big thing will be being able to be a crafter or certain items needed for quests. Like the item in the lumber camp for horde in Ashenvale. I think it‚Äôs a gun. But the reward is really good for most people do the quests  
---
I‚Äôm also wildly against loot trading as well, as I literally don‚Äôt see a purpose for it, even in higher level content, it really just doesn‚Äôt belong into classic. 
---
Aside from this, all of these example posts make me also just want to say go make some friends. If you don‚Äôt have a couple leveling buddies by the 30s (yea rip deadmines loot trading), you are probably doing classic wrong (my opinion, but isn‚Äôt classic all about the community?). And else, if you don‚Äôt plan on making leveling buddies, then level with buddies. 
---
And if you don‚Äôt wanna make any friends, and not make any effort to be polite or friendly to others, you kinda deserve people to ninja loot from you. 
---
This is the NUMBER ONE thing I hate about new mmos. Back in UO, SWG, EQ, and old versions of WoW, the games were social experiences. Now it‚Äôs hard to find a guild who even hops on discord or shows up to hang out outside of raids.
---
If I wanted to play solo content I would play a single player rpg with better story and gameplay. 
---
Man, how I hate these posts!  
---
You want social contact? then use the chat instead of the group finder.  
---
There's so many players complaining there's no social contact, and fucking none of them does things "the old way", and that's because you are **comfortable** with the easy way, you yourself don't want to waste time, but try to put the blame on others!
---
Good to know, if that's the case.
---
They did mention that there were no weather effects as of yet during the Blizzcon panel, and that they'd need to reimplement them from the ground up. Something about DirectX and some other technical things. Since it's a new engine they'll need to recreate it.
---
Hopefully they do recreate it, it's a huge part of the classic atmosphere.
---
*Not a sellable, and can only keep if you don‚Äôt complete the quest line. 
---
It would be damn cool if Blizz focused on the game we are playing and not get distracted by posts like this.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong then or now, Just saying plently of folks are still going to play how they like whether they know what is Bis or not.
---
There's always a difference between someone who lived an experience and someone that read about it after the fact.  You can't take that personally.
---
having to fight people is part of the experience though in terms of resources. I also picture a fair amount of people taking their level 1s to stv to try to get the chests first drop on server. People will have fun and if its hard to quest/grind they will probably become social with each other. At least thats my guestimate.
---
Leap of faith brothers!
---
&gt;playing it for 15 years of vanilla 
---
We're to believe you started playing in 2004 on a priest, and then immediately jumped over to private servers on the day that TBC was released? You've been playing non-stop until now? Okay, fine. It's what makes the most sense in your post right now.
---
The rest of what you're saying largely makes no sense however. You're also either forgetting or simply don't know that it depends on the faction. In alliance raids, priests will most likely be raid healers who are spamming rank 3 flash heal while the paladins are tank healers. +Healing is very important because without it you can't even downrank your flash heals.. Meanwhile, in horde raids you'll be tank healers. The shammies are on raid heal duty. More room for greater heals and such. But even then they WILL want to downrank greater heal once they have enough +healing for it. You'll want to avoid using max rank heals as much as possible or else you'll go oom no matter how large your mana pool is.
---
&gt;Also you will find most high end priest players will 90% be PI/Holy 
---
PI spec is pretty nice because of that big mana pool. But you're saying "high end priest" here. You'll definitely want that +healing from gear to make it even better. OP said he wants to do small raids and dungeons.
---
From my experience in the guilds I've been in on alliance, all priests go PI once we have that raid on farm. Why? Because they can. They have the gear for it and the dps are min-maxers who want to squeeze out every litte possible dps they can.
---
What OP said:
---
&gt;I was curious on a the matter of your personal preference towards stats when you do **dungeon farms, smaller raids** in Vanilla 
---
You mean you got something better than lotus/devilsaur farming? Seems unlikely unless youre gonna monopolize a special potion. 
---
I think that‚Äôs very optimistic of you, but realistically what proportion of players will to to stv? Less than 1? Yes people will group up but 100 groups in Northshire Abbey still doesn‚Äôt solve the problem. 
---
&gt;There's always a difference between someone who lived an experience and someone that read about it after the fact. 
---
So you mean that someone who started during an expansion after Vanilla would, on average, have less understanding and knowledge of the game than someone who actually played during Vanilla?
---
I am against loot sharing because it can lead to abuse. the only way i could, maybe and i mean maybe, see it being allowed is within 5 minutes and 100 percent of the people in the group have to agree to it. And as i said even then only maybe!
---
Loot is a much bigger deal in vanilla than it is in the current system and having a system to help screw non guildies/friends over can and will be exploited.
---
Reasons why I choose Orc Warrior over Tauren, for tanking on a PvP servers.
---
1.Orc Warriors lvl faster. This counts A LOT, because an Orc Warrior will hit 60 before a Tauren does. And will have better gear faster. A guild will always get a lvl 60 tanks vs a lvl 58.
---
2.Being on a PvP server, an Orc Warrior (even if Warriors suck for leveling) will still have less deaths compared to a Tauren. And that also counts toward getting to lvl 60 faster.
---
3. As Orc Warrior, you can always drop tanking for the DPS role.
---
Even min-maxing guilds won't care if their MT is an Orc or a Tauren. The difference is minimal. But they will care WHICH tank will be the first available to raid.
---
And that will always be an Orc, especially on PvP servers.
---
I was astounded by how much cash a pair of rogues pickpocketing SM brought in.
---
Stand in the fire, dps higher!
---
I think at this point the arguments against loot trading are well articulated. Anyone who has actually looked into the issue and has the mind to comprehend it has already well understood that loot trading is not a good idea.
---
The only way it would ever be acceptable, if it is acceptable at all, would be in Master Looter parties.
---
Warning though : With loot trading such scenarios won't happen either. Too much incentive to avoid dungeon PuGs. Hopefully Blizzard doesn't implement that feature in the end.
---
Y I K E S
---
On a brand new server i walked all the way to stv and there were 2 others there. I know first hand it happens because the gold and green in the chest made me very short term the richest person on the whole server.
---
Fewer spelling mistakes.
---
&gt; my knowledge about it is just as extensive.
---
Is it though?   I‚Äôm not trying to gatekeep or anything, nor am I calling you ignorant, but some parts of Vanilla WoW can‚Äôt sufficiently explained through posts/videos or experienced on a p-server. 
---
The sense of discovery of everyone figuring out the game together and being part of a living community is part of what made Vanilla Wow such an amazing game, and that can‚Äôt really be 100% understood without experiencing it organically. 
---
In any rate, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre excited and we‚Äôre happy to have you.  
---
Become a tailor and charge people to use their cloth to make bags. Early game everyone wants/needs bags because there are no higher levels to make bags or give older bags to newbies.
---
Ask r/wowservers. This is not the sub for pserver talks.
---
They cannot not have it. It wouldn't be Classic/Vanilla without it. :)
---
Yes, but no.
---
That would increase the hype.
---
There will always be one paladin on judgement of light, and one on judgement of wisdom. Normally you want the person doing light to be wearing 3 piece tier 1.  Since most paladin's spec for improved Wis anyway, The person judging Wis is normally delegated to the worst geared paladin, if all are equal gear than it's just up to the raid to decide
---
farm bats in Eastern plaguelands their grey stuff sells for a lot of gold. best way is to provide some service so people pay you their cash, key service, tank service, pvp service...
---
Blame the user, right?
---
If the shoe fits.. no one forces you to use group finders.
---
Same. I'm going Moonkin anyway. Even for levelling. Just maybe with a few points in resto so folks will group with me :p
---
Yep, it will be nice to have groups talk to each other more often again. Though I imagine instead of spamming in trade for groups, most will prob form groups in the server discords.
---
Not 100% sure but I imagine the new bnet community features could be put in as well.
---
What the fuck did I just read?
---
If you don't have friends then you deserve to be stolen from?  Please don't tell me your argument was founded on people with no friends are inherently unfriendly or impolite.
---
As someone that didn't belong to a guild, didn't play with friends, and PUGed my way all the way up to, and through Sunwell Plateau before I quit, everything you said is wrong.  :/
---
If it was solo i would say warlock or hunter because they get pets to help out. As a duo really anything works. Especially if one of you is a healer.
---
It always kinda bothered me that Blizz allowed ranged attacks on Warrior/Rogues but never gave them any skills or talents to expand the option. Rogues should have been able to throwing knifes (maybe a smaller duration on the poison though).
---
Weird bc he didn‚Äôt mention this happening in classic. He just said streamers and 40 mans in cities. 
---
I like Alliance a lot more, but I wanna play Rogue this time around and I refuse to play against Orcs as a Rogue. 
---
It‚Äôs one thing when they are standing still or half interacting with NPCs, but when most are constantly casting spells, it messes with the server. 
---
Burning Steppes. The music. The mobs. The quests. Blackrock Mountain looking in the west. Oh my god I can't wait for classic.
---
If I was the only one farming lotus and devilsaur then of course lol, but the problem with those methods is that I have to fight against other people which brings down the hourly profit a ton compared to the other methods.
---
I had to watch the episode after seeing that.
---
&gt;Good isntant 60 pvp 1.12 server to test the classes?
---
ty
---
That‚Äòs not what OP is talking about. A mechanic that gives you a suggested realm after choosing a faction you want to play would be closer to what OP wants. 
---
"1 glod plz"
---
So just because someone enjoys playing more solo then group focused, he or she should be the target for ninja looters? I really do hope we are not on the same server..
---
Community is a great deal in Vanilla, but damn I see so many toxic people on this board I doubt it's going to be a big friendly community.
---
Why would an average person spend most of their time raiding in Naxx or take time off work for Naxx? Most people have other priorities/needs, that doesn't mean they don't have the mental stamina to be a Naxx raider. You said it yourself, it takes a shitload of time to raid Naxx or even AQ40, most guilds didn't even see Naxx because an average guild that raids twice a week is gonna need a lot of gear for Naxx and average people don't have the time to invest in all of that grind. Imagine raiding twice a week for months and still not having AQ40 cleared because of the gear checks, that was your average vanilla guild because a single raid day didn't have a lot of loot for 40 at all, now imagine still being in the grind trying to kill bosses, that's even less loot available, now do this for 40+ in an average guild that raids twice a week.
---
Top end raiding is a different world and even then they took a shitload of time to even get to the final bosses back then, the 4 horsemen were alive and well for 2 months post release, 2 months!
---
The orc racial is useless for tanking, however the troll one is very good, it helps you build threat faster at the beginning of an encounter. Plus trolls look cool :o
---
nobody forces you to equip gear either, but you're at a severe disadvantage if you dont.
---
Yeah but in effect, everyone uses group finders. Trying to find a group manually is a fool's errand in modern wow.
---
It is true that ultimately the social element of group finding was killed by the player base. It would have been entirely possible for the community to ignore the feature like they did with integrated voice chat (we'll ignore the fact that LFD had unique emblem rewards associated with it).
---
But I think the history of mmo development has very solidly taught us that the things that convenience features take away often aren't fully recognized until later down the line and as much as MMOs are social games, they are also numbers games. Somewhere deep in our lizard brain we are motivated to seek the path of least resistance. It's the games systems that determine how any game is played. The community can only do so much.
---
Plus, LFD is a very asocial, public transit sort of experience. If the goal was to facilitate social interaction then it's been a total failure.
---
Hyrdrocane or whatever it was that gave you waterbreathing.
---
The shield that dropped from the lost vikings that acted as a parachute.
---
Reported for spammer. Please stop with these daily threads, we all know no one wants loot trading! 
---
Another great video. Keep them coming. 
---
No, this is exactly what caused a lot of the current problems.  What you need to do is a find a group of trustworthy people, something like a guild, or just friends.  I want the social aspect to return and one of the reasons for it was getting a bunch of people you trust.
---
&gt;you kinda deserve people to ninja loot from you.
---
??? People with fewer friends dont deserve loot as much as you do?
---
There is no end to classic wow. They should keep Vanilla servers and only add to content to new servers. 
---
Please stop with these posts and assumptions - you don‚Äôt speak for everyone. 
---
I agree, but this "community" aspect is what a lot of people praise. Gettin killed in pvp? Get friends. Cant lockdown a farm spot? Get a guild. Gettin stomped in bgs? Make a premade. Gettin loot stolen? Dont group in pugs.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for coming across as a bit of a douche, and you‚Äôre right. My perception is skewed from Pservers because everyone there is min/max tryhards. With the official re-release the barrier to entry is much much lower for casual players so hopefully we‚Äôll have a more relaxed environment.
---
I missed everything after wrath and came back recently. It's not even close to being the same game. Felt lost and quit after a week. 
---
Mage's can be a lot more common as most DPS classes can be. And its healers are often easier to get into groups with but at the end of the day its about what you are going to enjoy playing. If you want to play mage you can go for it. 
---
THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE, NO CHANGES 
---
REEEEE^EEEEE^EEEEE^EEEEE^EEEEE
---
Swamp of sorrows and blasted lands. I try my hardest too avoid as much of those zones as I can. 
---
Yeah see one is a core gameplay mechanic and one is an object of convenience. Don't mistake the two.
---
What class has the most dkp efficiency then? Maybe warlock?
---
you're sabotaging yourself if you dont use the tools available to you, this includes instant ques for dungeons.
---
Nah it won‚Äôt be a problem for sure, bro! I am rolling a mage too. You will 90% of the time find a group for a dungeon. Just don‚Äôt be a douchebag toward others in-game and you‚Äôll be safe, and probably make some new friends along the way too. 
---
I want a social experience to make friends &gt; I also want speed with the game &gt; I'll use dungeon finder instead &gt; nobody talks for 5 dungeons &gt; I want a social experience to make friends. Repeat.
---
Na.  The very first song that must be played is the old log in theme.  After that play whatever you want.
---
Or, go back to when the game had different core values, and provided a better environment for the latter.
---
There will be many mages but they are also much needed, as they were the best caster dps in early raids. So it is possible to get into groupsy but if you're worried about that, than rolling as a healer or tank is always a good choice. Also i heard alliance warlocks are more rare than their horde counterpart, and also in demand. 
---
It had a group finder system. No one used it. Originally summoning stones were used as crude group finding points. However it was much easier to /who 40-42 and find people by whispering them.
---
This question is asked far too often.
---
In HS, no class is pink (Paladin cards are gold colored).
---
Skinning, whatever instance mobs your class can solo (lashers, mara etc), dungeon farming if you and your guild get geared fast, and of course normal mobs like the EPL bats.
---
Grave moss
---
what the fuck did i just read
---
I think the limit was no cross faction on the same server (maybe just PVP servers? That's all I played on).
---
Enchanting is a money sink and not lucrative unless you're one of the first players on the server to get a valuable recipe. Don't take it unless you expect to have your guild feed you recipes. 
---
I personally dont like dw shaman either, but for sake of this example, your splitting hairs
---
I am joining a RP-PvP realm for their more-likely maturity comparing to PvP realms. I am not ‚Äòthat‚Äô interested in RP per say, but I want to be amongst a mature community and still have the option to World PvP without the frustration of opposing faction didn‚Äôt flag themselves for PvP. Getting ganked won‚Äôt be an issue. Sure, it happens, but it is fun in he long run and part of the experience.
---
True
---
I get that. The one I was thinking of however is two streamers staysafetv and tipsoutbaby who are friends but they are going opposite faction.
---
You‚Äôre referring to pocket sand. Sha sha sha
---
Bag of marbles and all those random quest rewards that had OP effects... yea, I always kept them in bank "because there will be that one day when they become useful :)" 
---
I dont want xpac re-releases. Its a bit lazy. The entire problem IMO with WoW xpacs is that they completely invalidate your work within hours, if not minutes. The extra levels, large power gains, and a completely separate world cause drift between levelers and people at cap. 
---
What I would like to see is
---
1) balance. Inb4 #nochanges i think this is at least worth looking at.  
---
2) New old world content. Keep the zones relevant. Progress stories.  
---
3) "side-grade" gear. Since ilvl isnt a thing, and main stat isnt a thing, I feel there is room for scaling sideways instead of "here's the same gear but stronger". On hit effects, specific resistances, different stat distributions, etc. This /might/ require squishing some of the old raids/gear, simply to allow some power upgrades on new content without causing capped players to just roflstomp others (I've seen people say this is a problem with Naxx gear)   
---
Obviously these things can be implemented poorly, would require some serious work to do well, and I'm sure some #nochanges players would be vehemently against it. 
---
Then go in a group with friends 
---
You want a safe space go play retail then 
---
the group finder back then wasnt intrusive in the same way, and meeting stones didn't have summoning capability, so you still had to rely on your social network and reaching out, making friends. To avoid spamming LFM Maraudon for an hour in trade or LFG
---
The hunter.
---
For an absolute beginner who will likely spend a lot of time on her own (most players who are new to MMOs treat it largely like a single player game) it's definitely the easiest class to start with.
---
And if she likes it, it's also a nice class to continue playing.
---
You wont have a problem to find a group as an mage. In Raids you want to fill like 4-6 slots with mages. For normal instances you will always have room for a mage. Every group wants one for cc, demage and water/food. I will roll a tank as main to play with my girldfriend and a mage as twink, whenever she wants to do something else. Only problem with a mage is, as raid or dungeon dd it is very boring to play. Mostly you spam frostbolts and from time to time some aoe. Thats it. PvP on the other hand is realy interesting. So play and enjoy it.
---
It's very simple to me. No rules deathmatch is my favorite thing to do and it's a dying genre/mode in video games. I don't want equality, scores or rule set with certain win conditions. I want to farm my purps and after that get out into the world and kill everyone. I hate all the hordies equally regardless of level.
---
it seems annoying to be on seal duty every 10 sec sitting near a dangerous boss and still focusing on raid frames
---
Because vanilla rogue is nothing like its modern counterpart. The cooldowns are much longer, and it's very easy to fuck up and get yourself killed, even against non-elite mobs at your current level.
---
For people who know what they are doing, know the game, know the basics, know the rough layout of the maps, it's a conveniant class to play. For people new to MMOs and WoW in particular, it will be "oops I pulled 2 more" -&gt; dead, all the time.
---
DPS is the most abundant archetype.  You'll always have a much easier time finding a group as a healer/tank.  Mages are probably the most sought after DPS for groups due to free food/water and sheep, but it'll still be harder finding a group than a healer would.  
---
"Casual" can mean several things. 
---
It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs other pressing stuff to discuss. Let OP have his discussion.
---
I remember leveling up my first character. This was the only trinket I had for the longest time even after hitting 60. I was so bad...
---
its not that bad for raid viability as mage cuz there are many needed anyway
---
if you do want an easier way to PVE then play warlock or shaman or paladin
---
Yeah the cooldowns are much longer but they still have the most out of any class. Base damage on evicerate is really hard. Most people can manage a stunlock and vanish adds a lot of safety. If you pull more than one mob you can manage with cooldowns, you can easily get away, no?
---
It's allright I'll be ally, bonebiter will cover me for a while. Allright for corpsemaker.
---
Agree :)
---
Those are at least confirmed!
---
This.
---
Akward
---
Didn‚Äôt play in 2005 on a rogue so can‚Äôt confirm 
---
That is the point of my video! We should be asking for it! 
---
Also true 
---
Lol. Agree. I can't get pink=paladin out of my brain anyway.
---
Which is crazy! I made so many amazing friends in my pserver and got to experience something that blizzard destroyed. 
---
First, you have to remember, there is no dungeon finder or cross-realm in classic.  If you dick people over like that, it‚Äôll hurt your reputation which actually does matter.
---
Second, even without loot trading, there is nothing preventing this behavior anyways.  Creating tickets to ‚Äúloot trade‚Äù has been around since forever.  If you take away loot trading you‚Äôre just going to clog up the ticket system slowing down real issues that need to be resolved.  It might even require the hiring of more GMs depending on the volume, which hurts the profitability of the game.
---
From your other posts I gathered you want to break a paladin leveling speed at launch (have you considered counseling first ? ;-)   
---
How do you expect to reliably source any of those potions / stones if you're one of the top high levels of the server, there's nothing at the AH and you don't have the time to craft ? Do you have a guild supporting you ?  
---
I had a similar project, I wanted to try a server first (not pally though, I'm not THAT masochistic ;-) and I thought I would be weak on sleep but fast on leveling. So today I tried to lvl for 24h without any significant downtime (started friday 7pm until today around 4pm because the pserver kicked me out, they probably think I'm a bot :D ).  
---
It was much easier than what I thought (I just did 2 min burst of exercise every 1.5 hours and slept 20 min twice) however I'm almost 4 hours slower than Joana to reach lvl 20 while following his guide. Yikes !  
---
I think I lost a lot of time on 2 points :  
---
1- I died a lot (Sarkoth, Zalazane, Tiragarde). I don't know if Joana has help through tanking or healing buddies, or gear is funneled to him or pserver is wrong on mob stats or I'm just shit at the game :D
---
2- it was my first run since Vanilla, so 13 years later I don't remember exactly where is the arrow vendor or the path to reach a hidden quest (remembered Mankrik wife though :D ). I lost a lot of time looking for things.
---
So now I'm reconsidering grinding, since I won't have the time to learn the route well enough. 
---
Not sure I have the patience though.  
---
Im actually planning to track them manually just for my personal benefit with many other things separated by zones. But im going even further an doing it in a small nicely bound notebook I cant wait 
---
I bet that might not work in 2019.
---
Okay, maybe in 2004 when porn was harder to come by, but 20019? Come on
---
If you two like, this video outlines some thoughts on classes that compliment one another.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4
---
Would it be lame if they just used some of the videos from Hurricane and like paid him for it or something? The Naxx video he made was fucking epic
---
Wtf he meant unwind
---
I think that's a fair assumption.
---
Someone who watched YouTube videos of Vanilla and TBC players wall jumping, wouldn't have the same understanding of how tactful of an art it was compared to someone that spent years doing it.  You also couldn't give a YouTube viewer the emotional response of something so integral being removed.  You could never encapsulate how the mood of an entire server changed, unless you lived it.
---
Another way of putting it, I don't think watching Tiger Woods play golf is a guarantee you'll become technically good at golf yourself or even get a real understanding of how much both he and the game changed over the years to reach that point.  I also don't think reading articles about the Berlin wall can make you understand what it was like to live in East Berlin.
---
What little remains of vanilla wow, archived in old forum posts and warcraftmovies uploads, could never give someone the same understanding or knowledge as the person who were there.
---
So you have to pay extra to have the same gaming as someone else through no fault of your own?
---
You wanna play classic wow? Go private server because blizzard have not supported it for the last 12 years and isn't going to cha...oh wait!
---
It will Hurt your rep either way so i dont mind if they let this in
---
Blizzard made billions last quarter and still laid off 800 people. Don't worry about their fucking pennies. 
---
The OP is clearly talking about reduced playing time and not being able to race through the game.
---
&gt; So you have to pay extra to have the same gaming as someone else through no fault of your own?
---
I'm so sorry that someone has convinced you that life is fair. I guess it's never too late to learn, though.
---
While I agree with you that I don't want loot trading in classic, I don't think it's going to impact pugging THAT much. 
---
Ion's quote at Blizzcon:
---
&gt; ‚Äú[Loot Trading] was added to solve a common problem that existed back in Classic where if you accidentally looted an item that someone else meant to get‚Äîor maybe you master looted to the wrong person‚Äîyou could open a CS support ticket and say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to loot this, I‚Äôd like to give it to so and so,‚Äù and it would take a four or five day turnaround time, but CS would generally help you out with that problem and transfer the item.
---
&gt; This is the case where **we‚Äôre keeping loot trading in because the end result is the same. We‚Äôre saving you a four or five day wait, but we‚Äôre also freeing CS to focus on other player issues.**‚Äù
---
Fair enough. You den knowledgable. Mat i ask, what do you think of rogue pickpocket runs and are you going to level solo or in a group?
---
You hate these posts? Then use /r/wow.
---
See how that works?
---
This is one thing that always bothered me, loads of alliance would refer to DM as dead mines rather than VC which was annoying when as a mainly horde player I asking dire maul group and half the idiots would whisper why I can‚Äôt solo it. 
---
The problem is that it would result in exactly the opposite effect you want and cause higher imbalance as people that want to play a specific faction would seek servers where that faction has an advantage already causing a snowball effect.
---
I almost always play on PvP servers. It's not too bad and adds a sense of danger to the world. Its really annoying when you are farming and can't kill the competition on the opposing faction.
---
I can see why you're not worried because you clearly don't have a firm grasp on the problem.  Ignorance is bliss I suppose.
---
Why should I need to go around reporting people for using the system they were given by Blizzard as a tool to use against me?  Loot trading is a broken system.  Period.
---
I love that you're a super optimist and things will work out because everyone holds high positive moral values, but they don't.  You ideals are like that lady who wanted to hitchhike across Iraq to show how kind the world was, she was raped and killed by the first person that picked her up.
---
Besides, seeing large scale up events is just amazing.
---
You can (and should) spec into [Lasting Judgment](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=20361), which increases your judgement's uptime by 30 seconds. Still have to reapply it occasionally.
---
LET TEH BODIES HIT THE FLOOR, LET TEH BODIES HIT THE FLOOR.
---
I feel like this doesn‚Äôt fully grasp how the tank is 100m ahead of the group without paying attention to the group. 
---
Exactly things like Bnet integration and discord servers, basically the entire way the internet in right now compared to 10 years ago. Makes me believe that classicwow is not going to change anything about the community or the way people behave in dungeons etc. the thing that made mmo's so good in the past was the community, and I don't think we'll be able to go back.
---
I miss the Linken quests from Ungoro most of all
---
True but shaman is the same deep blue
---
The server 'reputation' meme. If people have a chance to ninja they will.
---
Watching tiger now will make you worse XD. 
---
Boss needs MOAR DOTS
---
Play what you want tbh. You wont be satisfied if you are playing something based on getting raid spots, which you will as mage anyway.
---
better to entirely scrap loot trading/reporting/game master support ticket help. Than to introduce a tool for griefing, that wasn't part of vanilla.
---
Was it ever?
---
And the nets off murlocs!!!
---
I think they are just working in a more solid system and just isn't ready to announce it. I hope for a loot trade system that only works in raids if master looter is used. It will solve 90 percent of the tickets that were made back in the day. Outside if that it should just be tough luck. There is no additional cost for Blizzard to introduce this. Loot trading is a no no.
---
do u have to melee it too?
---
Does concussive shot consume arrows?
---
I have never done those runs personally. But if I'm not mistaken some items were added later on in vanilla to the boxes, so depending on the item progression in classic it might or might not be worth it. They will make it harder to farm black lotuses for example like you might have read, so who knows. I think a rogue from my old guild got like 30g/h doing pickpocket runs though.
---
I will level in a group
---
I could hop on this as well if it's a pvp server. Dwarf or undead priest. Discord DangerSpud#4341
---
I disagree, I believe it will be better as we now have better tools for organisation and meeting people. Its not like an auto-queue as people still need to communicate for content. Its a chance to create a more social atmosphere and finding your perfect guild.
---
Yes that was the point of my entire post
---
Priest or hunter are the easiest. Priest you literally just shield and wand*. Hunter you just send pet in and auto attack*. 
---
*Yea may not be the fastest way to level,  but pretty darn easy. 
---
How to not to summon a demon lord fan art?
---
 Windfury totem + war is great, but with a druid you both benefit from grace of air totem. It might not be the same, but it's not a complete waste.
---
&gt;If you take away loot trading you‚Äôre just going to clog up the ticket system
---
There won't be a ticket system for loot.  They won't be answered.  This is not a problem.  This is common knowledge at this point.  Stop using Blizzard GM time management as a shit crutch for a poor argument about an 11 billion dollar corporations financing.
---
&gt; Considering that DM won't be available on release 
---
do we even know if it will be as farmable as before?
---
Sounds like a Blizzard mole üò≤
---
The community is not like this at all on private servers 
---
I would 100%.
---
More people to group with to do group quests, more people to talk to in chat, less chance of getting ganked by multiple horde at a time, and in the end more guilds to choose from
---
Yes, and so ninjas will. With or without loot trading. 
---
I just don‚Äôt believe the problem will be so immense as this subreddit sometimes expresses. This entire problem is based on feelings toward activision more than facts. We have no idea if this even will be a problem. Yes, it might happen occasionally, but we are sacrificing something else.
---
I like the idea to implement loot trading, but to ensure that all party members receive a notification that it happened. 
---
Every Alliance player on a pvp server knows what im talking about. Back in the day, right now on pservers, on Classic in 10 years. Doesnt matter. 
---
So i decided to make a bit of a goofy video about the struggles of being ganked in Redridge, and included some people who relay their own trauma leveling there. That being said aint nothing stopping me from rerolling on a pvp server every time lol. 
---
Im the same guy from Vancleef Did Nothing Wrong, among a few others posted here btw. Hope some of ya'll like this one too!
---
Then don‚Äôt play their games. 
---
there will be tonnes of tailors to compete with
---
some will do it for free for skillup
---
ranged dps class or healer are the easiest.
---
r/trees is easily the most positive community on Reddit. Sorry friend. This place can be pretty toxic 
---
Yes, my entire post history screams out Blizzard mole 
---
Grind stuff that drops good vendor trash. Wild cats are usually the best.
---
&gt; How do you expect to reliably source any of those potions / stones if you're one of the top high levels of the server, there's nothing at the AH and you don't have the time to craft ? Do you have a guild supporting you ?
---
Likely no guild support, but I'll be mining for engineering, so I'll have stones aplenty. Like you I plan on taking intermittent breaks, and I can plan somewhat around "LF BS to make stones, meet me in Darkshire in 5 minutes" 20 weightstones will last me 10 hours, less than 1.5 minutes work.
---
And with scrolls, which will drop intermittently for anyone in the zone. "/1 buying scrolls at 2/3/5x vendor price"
---
My current pace puts me at level 20 in about 10 hours, 30 in about 24, very close to maintaining Joana's pace.
---
20m to your corpse? I've never seen such a run in classic, where would that be?
---
Also, no it's not an issue. Dying is a punishment as is the corpse run that comes with it. 
---
Wow another banger, you just keep delivering!
---
I think Classic WoW will honestly be massive. This mass quitting of people that is being speculated will not happen in my opinion. Games like OSRS show people will play on old games with terrible graphics if the gameplay is satisfying, not that WoW Classic will have terrible graphics but you see my point. 
---
The biggest thing is there is no alternative to Classic apart from retail which is losing subs everyday. All MMORPGs are going the same route as retail anyway, any numbers they have are shrinking. 
---
I think Classic WoW could be amazing moving forward. But I think going the route of TBC WOTLK etc would be a mistake. People will not follow the same route for years for various reasons. If Blizzard build on Classic WoW and take it a different route it could ironically be the WoW killer everyone has been waiting for. I want to play Classic, but I doubt I will go through each expansion again.
---
Well, I surely remember loot masters making mistakes. 
---
No it is good it takes time running to corpse. Makes it feel like a penalty cost, instead of just a fast run back. And if you dont like running so slow while you are dead. NE has a racial for it.
---
That's why you roll NE for improved death then it becomes only 10 mins!
---
As someone who tanks random hero for runes, I find DDs and sometimes even healers, who think they're the ones to pull. I like to light up a joint, when I see a stupid DD jumping alone into the next pack. Let's see if you survive.
---
Community is definitely in my top 3 reasons for wanting Classic WoW so badly.. that was such a massive part of the game for me. Even the assholes on the forums talking smack about me for getting a warglaive from Illidan on our first kill. That meant people actually knew about me and gave a damn.. even if it meant they hated me haha!
---
Same -- I would literally attend a midnight launch for Classic for a physical Collector's Edition. I really hope they make one. 
---
I'm still not sure. It will probably be both. Will play horde on one server and alliance on the other. 
---
The guild discord I am currently in is super friendly and everyone talks. We expect most people in the guild to hit 60 in 2-3months. There is a respect for the leveling process and having fun being the forefront of rules. However we do plan to progress and get down to business.
---
Frost I fucking love you man. Some of the videos you put out I already know everything in them and I still watch them just to hear your soothing ass voice and amazing commentary thank you so much for the videos man
---
So true. Today, at 6 am, I logged on and needed help finishing an elite quest in Duskwood. There were 10k people online so it was easy to find a group. As I ran to reach the grave to do the quest I talked to our party leader about Redridgebeast, a 29 twink ganker that we had both been dealing with for the last 3 years across various servers. He asked if I needed help with a different quest in the area, I did, but he had to go shortly so we added each other to friends to go do some more quests later. This all happened today and is a regular occurrence on pservers.
---
I quit retail in MOP, and I'm pretty sure the last time I added a random person to my friends list on retail was before Cata. The last time I leveled to cap, I didn't even leave town after level 10, I just back to back dungeon finder spammed. The game is literally an instanced single player game now. 
---
Every time I see a dev post I just imagine how much time was wasted writing that and not fixing up whatever systems they still have to finish to make real wow work right.
---
In my experience druid/hunter
---
I'm not entirely sure myself honestly, my ideal scenario would be an 18 month content release schedule followed by 6 months of cooling off (Farming full tier 3, mounts, etc). Then we see a batch of fresh servers come in and repeat the same two year cycle. By 2023, Blizz would probably have a much clearer vision of where they would like to see the game head. Some may say we'd be indulging in Classic for too long, but I guess that argument boils down to "we'll wait and see".
---
&gt;because the end result is the same
---
That's unfortunately where Ion was wrong.  Loot trading abuse happening at every level of group PvE isn't an accurate representation of "same."
---
Or you could interrupt that as, we're now streamlining abuse, which I also have a problem with.
---
i'm just saying i rather those mistakes stay mistakes, and whoever is master looting learns from it.   
---
Rather than offer any friend duo, trio, or 4 man team. The temptation of stacking need rolls to help out a mate.  
---
It's very easy, to feel like that feral druid isn't really doing anything worthwhile, so why shouldn't your hunter friend get prio on that polearm drop.   
---
Woop, now grouping with "friends" or "guildies" that aren't from your guild, suddenly opens you up to being 1v4'd everytime an item you need drops. Rather than the 50/50 chance you'll have if just the hunter/druid needed on the polearm.  
---
I'm not saying it will happen all the time, but when it does, it sucks hard. And i'm entirely willing to throw a careless masterlooter under the bus rather than always having to vet the groups you join from potentially stacking rolls against you after a 3hour brd run.
---
As a survivor from back in the day, the only thing unrealistic a out this photo is how few bones are laying around .
---
The 'big' streamers tend to attract people that are very volatile. When it comes to Classic finding a group of people who are stable are trustworthy is alpha Omega.
---
Theyre using the "new way" because everyone else is. There isn't anyone in the general chat looking for groups to do dungeons. I can't believe I have to explain this to another being with a brain 
---
Nope. I think graveyards every 10 feet making world pvp completely pointless in the modern game is the issue. Vanilla WoW wasn't made for one demographic like the modern game, where  people have no punishments for their failures in a completely meaningless game.
---
PPVP speaks to me more it makes the world feels more dangerous and scary. And it somehow brings the factions together, when someone is getting ganked or got ganked and asking for help. It can be extremly frustrating or rewarding, but when you get that kind of respons or emotion out of it, it really makes it feel fun to play.
---
When i played on PVE server, it feelt kinda odd seeing oposite faction farm something or steal your mobs, and you could not punish him, or atleast warm him. The "gap" between the factions disapeared to me, kinda like why even have 2 factions. When non of us feel hate or anger towards each other.
---
melee or rejudge every 40 seconds, yeah.
---
In vanilla it reduced the rage loss from not being in combat. Did t help during combat.
---
PvP server. I always roll with boys tho not quest together but always with in a zone distance. Also the cluster STV can become is insane! You will lose hours(maybe not that long for some players) but for me yes of pvp action in STV that Nessie‚Äôs camp and all the quests that are included with it. Will know you will spend a little more then 10-11 lvls so you have to think like that. The frustration is so real, but when your on the hunt it‚Äôs worth every second. 
---
Probably a mage or hunter like others are saying.
---
Everyone always complains about this but I found when playing retail someone just needs to break the ice and start talking, and then others will join in (usually).
---
At golf and handling marital issues.  Rofl
---
Best classic content creator!
---
You are incorrect. The tooltip was bugged. The way it reduced rage loss by 30% was giving you 1 rage every 3 seconds. So technically it does but it does that by generating rage in AND out of combat.
---
No tooty- no pooty 
---
Just to get feared into the eggs right after she landed so u will have no rage to berserker rage out..
---
i have no problems with merch, but the game i have already bought with Collector's Edition. if they force me to buy the same game twice atleast check my battle.net account and see it was activated when vanilla launched, and give me a discount.
---
Yes please! Take my money
---
Exactly. This is a must have. Just a tip to the guys who are thinking about rolling Druids on horde: keep in mind that you'll never be a real master shapeshifter without Furbolg Form.
---
Night Elf is master race.  Don't devalue my racials!!
---
It worked in vanilla. That's how ony was 3-manned
---
Yeah it definitely wont be that big of an issue. It will just increase the amount of times people joining a group by themselves getting fucked over by 2-3 friends loot trading amongst themselves. Its going to be super lame but its not going to be that common I wouldn't think.
---
You're obnoxious; "life is not fair, don't even ask for it. Give up".
---
IT‚ÄôS DPS NOT DD
---
Oh I absolutely needed this thank you!!
---
Because the fee is way less than the materials required to max the profession, nevermind getting the plans.
---
Bernie Sanders' personal sex slave comes to weigh in on economics.
---
Record gross income isn't profit which is what I understood it to be. How much did they make, and so you want a lawsuit against them by their shareholders for not firing those unneeded employees?

Same!

Did loremaster - trying to find hidden quests was awful. Thank god for wowhead!
---
Mages are great for lower level dungeons. They can prevent wipes with clutch frost novas and polys. They are also great for groups with a lower level or inexperienced tank/healer. 
---
All good dude, and a relaxed environment is what I'm hoping for.
---
&gt;You roll need, then you notice the warrior tank also rolling need... and the hunter and everyone else. The tank wins it, you're feeling a mix of bad emotions as you see him walk over the level 16 mage and stand by him for a bit before leaving and carrying on with the dungeon then you realize it was a group of people running their friend through the instance and they all just cheated you out of a fair chance of getting loot, and there's nothing you can do about it. 
---
I'm not going to defend loot trading, but this is flat out wrong. Loot trading has **NOT** functioned like this since Cataclysm LFR (Dragon Soul). In Dragon Soul, you were able to need literally every and any thing (plate on a mage, wands for warriors, etc.) and were able to trade it freely with anyone, regardless of what they rolled or what class they were.
---
In MoP, this was changed. Once you need rolled on **any BoP**, it instantly became soulbound to you. No matter what, you could **not** trade it. If you tried to put a ticket in to transfer it, guess what - nothing. Sometime in WoD (I think), this was updated to include BoE items - BoEs would bind to you if you needed them, even if you never even equipped them, regardless of item quality. In some later patch, the loot system was updated again to where you could only need on items that were for your class.
---
Meaning, if we assume they use the loot trading system from BFA, that warrior would never be able to need the Emberstone Staff and trade it to the mage. If someone else (druid/warlock/etc) needed it and won the roll, it is soulbound to him forever - no ticket will transfer it to his mage friend.
---
Does this mean loot trading isn't abusable? Fuck no, its still very abuse able. If a ML gives you an item, you can still trade it to whoever you want, regardless of what your raid lead wants. You and a bunch of friends can still /roll on items for ML in pugs and funnel it into one person. Greed rolls can still be freely traded, so you can still funnel gear that way (somehow, I guess?). 
---
For the record, this information comes from a dedicated ninja/loot troll with years of experience. I used to ninja literally everything in Dragon Soul, then auction the items off for gold (assuming they were on my server) or just DE them. I would intentionally equip a shitty set of gear after killing a boss in pugs and would /roll on items so I could loot trade them to my lesser geared friends. I would need BoEs for no reason other than I was already insanely rich and didn't care about others fortunes. And yes, I realize that I'm a colossal asshole for doing all of this. 
---
 [- Wisp Spirit: Transform into a wisp upon death, increasing speed by 50%.](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Racial_trait)
---
Its only 50%, not 100%, so you would be "gliding" in whisp form for like 13.3 minutes, if the corpse run was 20 minutes in some other form.
---
This is, most likely, the MAIN REASON why I personally want Classic.
---
Because EVERYTHING in Classic is designed with the SOCIAL ASPECT in mind.
---
you got quests from level 30-45 there.
---
"it was a group of friends running x through a dungeon" 
---
You didn't get cheated, you got a free VC quest run by lvl 20's who reserved the staff, sorry they forgot to mention it.
---
One of my fondest memories is of being carried through this dungeon as a lowly human priest that would dps in discipline. Once we got to Mr. Smite I thought he was a bad ass and decided to reroll as a tauren shaman. REPEL THE INVADORS
---
20 million is a bit of a stretch.
---
Now this is some solid content 
---
Your assuming tbis would lead to greater balance vs imbalance?
---
I don't think so.  
---
It would only cause the same thing that internet discussions do, just a bit earlier.  
---
At one point, better know in the beginning how the server's population is, than spend hours in the "wrong" faction and only discover it when it's too late.
---
On German servers you'll see 99% using DD and not DPS. Is it so hard to grasp that people are different?
---
I did this experiment on a daily basis in Legion. I would join LFG, start with "Hi guys", and waiting for an answer. Not even one in 10 cases I would get an answer.
---
So, I would leave the group...which sucked for them, because I only queue as a tank.
---
MOST of the times, in LFG, nobody will talk. Even if you "break the ice". And in those rare cases someone answers "Hi" back...its ALL you can get.
---
It‚Äôs dps not DD sorry not sorry. 
---
Hop on a pserver and check out redridge, ashenvale, stv, shimering flats, swamp or sorrows etc. See what you are missing out on.
---
Downvote me all you want. It's DD for Germans.

Maybe it's easier to get into raids as a healer, but for dungeons I don't think it's really true. There's only a single slot for healers in 5 mans and more people than you'd think roll healers in vanilla. Meanwhile dps get 3 slots and everyone and their mother wants a mage. Just roll the mage and don't worry about it, tons of people roll rogues and warriors too.
---
For those who seek a balanced server then it would yes. Some players want a heavily unbalanced server for certain reasons, this will just help them there quicker. 
---
There was one in the parc I think, next to the druid trainer?
---
I remember in the last fresh I got a rare vanity pet drop. I thought for sure this useless non combat pet would pay for my epic mount! Ended up selling it for like 90g a few months later. The market was just not there.
---
I've been to that coastline in Arathi a hundred times to check for Prince Najzek and I never knew there was a quest hub by that pirate ship. Awesome video.
---
Unpopular idea warning.
---
I'm hype for Classic, but some of us already bought the game once. I also don't want to encourage more special pet/rainbow pony, etc than we had when vanilla was live(mostly just TCG then).
---
Well, spaces where not allowed, iirc
---
I mean, we had ventrilo and such back in the day and chat was still always active. The community is always split between in game and out of game chat. And people that really want groups will advertise in both and people that want to talk to different communities of people will talk in both.
---
No. He did the record in six days real time.
---
exactly my experience. I‚Äôve even had people tell me to stop talking and keep moving

I wonder how much of this is down to modern voice software being the norm. Why type in game when you can chat to your friends hand free.

Welp, it's still a nice improvement xd.
---
Yes that is my thinking. Massive server imbalances happen anyway because some people want it like that. This would speed up the process and LOWER the risk of someone who does not want this to roll on a particular server. In fact this imbalance would be clear after day 1. The ones who want a unbalanced server will flock to the obvious ones, and the other servers will naturally maintain a more balanced state. 
---
I started late vanilla and I had a different experience. I believe it could be really good if you level with the masses and its aback and forth thing. For me it was always max or higher levels ganking in a relative empty zone... 
---
Funny thing is flying mount in BC cut out the awful part of the PVP, and the rest was much more enjoyable.
---
Even back then we used Ventrilo daily. Games nowadays just punish you for grouping together and reward you for solo play. They promote anonymity in gameplay rather than community responsibility and status.
---
Then this change would be a good thing. Players would know after day 1 which servers have naturally been designated to players who want imbalance. The other servers will naturally maintain a balance as people pick and choose based on keeping it close to 50/50. People can reroll very quickly if they see the server they picked will be 90% horde for example. 
---
Yes you can, but only every few minutes, that's my point. It doesn't matter when the cooldown is only 2 minutes, whenever you get in trouble you will have something to press, but with longer cooldowns, you get caught woth your pants down far more easily.
---
Also, don't forget that you will need reagents for your abilities (Blinding Powder, Vanishing Powder), and a Newbie will definitely forget to stock up at some point ;-)
---
I really support your idea, to be honest.  
---
Even though I prefer PvE servers, I usually roll a character or two on PvP ones, just to enjoy the occasional WPvP, and it would be useful to know how the odds are.
---
I really like Aszhara.

PTSTV
---
you need to work on your reading comprehension. He said "because the server can't handle it." So either he is implying a future classic server or a past vanilla server OR he is making a moot point to incite unfounded bullshit.
---
If blizzard main team has gone downhill then so has probably the cinematic department, so wouldn't let them ruin it
---
I'll eat my hat if Blizzard does something this simple and common sense.
---
Not saying people aren't excited. But this happens in almost every single community before the game is out.
---
 Recently Anthem launched. Everyone was positive, the devs kept interacting with people in the subreddit etc.. Cue the most positive community ever posts. 
---
Then the game launches and people have issues with different parts of the game.. this is not what we have been shown, why is loot so scarce etc etc.. 
---
Its easy being hyped and excited. But we will know more about how positive everyone will be once the game is out. Not saying they are gonna fuck everything up and you will be mad. 
---
I have high hopes for classic though, so keep up the positivity, but please dont start going around saying we are different than other subreddits etc. They all start out great, but dwindle down if the game wasnt what they originally thought. 
---
my 2c.
---
he is saying your suggestion is bad because it would create more imbalance
---
Make wisp spirit great again
---
Hey calm down
---
This hit me deep
---
Sounds like *your* class fantasy is dead.
---
Is anyone else the opposite of this? As long as there are enough players to do content with even if it takes more time I would rather be on the lower pop faction. 
---
A huge reason I am super excited for Classic is running into the opposing faction in the world again. This isn't a major thing for a lot of people but open world pvp is the most important thing to me. I enjoy the struggle.
---
I'm going to be downvoted into oblivion probably for this comment, but here it goes!
---
Loot trading is not going to be THAT big of a deal. I think we are overreacting to how much of a deal this will be.
---
Will there be abuse cases? Yes. Will it feel really bad when you're in the situation that OP is in and you lose out on a piece of gear? Yes. In the grand scheme of things though, losing out on that Emberstone staff really isn't that big of a deal. You will have PLENTY of opportunities to upgrade your staff if this circumstance did indeed happen to you. (BFD has a really nice staff, the Rod of the Sleepwalker and BFD is only 5-6 levels higher than DM) If you lose out on some low-level equipment, it's not the end of the world.
---
As a community though, however, we should do our best to make sure that these "loot traders" are known and blacklisted on our respective servers. The good thing about Vanilla is that you start to build a solid community within the realm. If this happens, make sure that people on the realm are aware as well as on the discord and hope that the strength of the community will help discourage that type of behavior. Just being on this sub, I feel very encouraged that these type of situations won't happen as frequently.
---
And I am saying he is wrong for the reason I stated.
---
I don‚Äôt get why they don‚Äôt just redesign the loot UI so players make less mistakes, like why are need and greed small icons RIGHT next to each other.
---
Retail admins. Retail macros. üôÅ
---
Yes! I agree and really like this idea. I would like to see some balance updates. Not nerfs (that will poss people off) but buff the classes and specs that were so useless so that players have more choice. The talent trees from burning crusade greatly improved the game. Even small things like moving Insect Swarm from restoration to balance where it makes more sense to be. 
---
The fundamental flaw in your argument is that you consider yourself to "be" undead.  You are human;  inflicted by undeath.
---
I can understand, even sympathize, with you desire for for meaning and belonging.  That is, after all, a desire shared by all the peoples of Azeroth.  Even still, you must recognize the difference in the birth of a new child, an act of creation and renewal, with the destruction and suffering required to bring a new Forsaken into the world.  
---
You lived your life.  It was tragically cut short.  As it is for so many.  I am content to let you exist in both you rotting mortal coil and the corpse of the once-great capital of Lordaeron, but there you must stay.  If you try to expand your territory or your numbers, you will be granted your final rest.
---
What kind of server is your guild going to roll on?
---
Silithis
---
Mmm...that seems unrealistic. I think it will be in the millions, but not nearly that many. Mostly because of the passage of time factors:  former players have less free time, new players have been exposed to more modern games over the last 15 years.
---
bristly whiskers get me hard
---
When going for world first you don't limit yourself to 12 hours a day playing. More than likely he was playing 16 - 20 hours a day.. Probably even more than that the first day. 
---
It's very fast, but 11 days isnt that crazy nowadays, but he said it was pretty fast for what they knew back then. 
---
I was never a big fan of the wetlands zone, The crocs on the paths, the really long walks the murlocks, the realy REALY high spawnrates of orcs. Yeah just never enjoyed it.
---
Funny since druid lvling is among the fastes in classic, especially compared to warriors.
---
PvP, the guild is requiem, you can find it on the LFG thread
---
Logically Classic's only option for Loot Trading is to allow everyone be able to NEED on everything. It simply can't be as strict as BFA's Loot Trading because in Classic, a wider selection of gear will be very useful to a lot more classes...
---
Holy Paladins for example are not just gonna run around with Plate in Classic. They'd probably grab some Cloth items with good Stats that help for healing.
---
Fury Warriors have a couple of BiS Pre-Raid items that are Leather, never mind the fact that some classes don't learn how to wear Plate until much later and they will be looking for Mail/Leather pieces during Levelling.
---
...Hence why Loot Trading might be a bit of an issue...
---
what are you a girl on bumble? saying Hi is not a conversation starter.
---
A physical collectors edition would be awesome if only because of players getting together at a midnight launch to hang out and talk about the game.
---
Lol, I rolled an NE Druid as my 1st toon back in vanilla.  I liked it at first, but I eventually found out that it sucked in both PvP/PvE compared to other classes.  By lvl45 I was bored and re-rolled a Warlock, much better. :)
---
I think the exposure to modern games would make them want to play classic more.  It will be a starch contrast that outlines the things that make classic so great.
---
Such class fantasy to have all dps Warriors wear leather, all Paladins wear cloth and every Mage going Frost.
---
If you sleep 3 hours a day, 5 days in game time is 5 days and 15 hours...
---
thats my Cleavy boi right there. &lt;void3
---
No one has bought Classic, it's a different game.  I wouldn't expect to get WC3 Reforged at a different price because I used to play WC3 either.
---
Just teasing üòú
---
I personally believe the best way to make this a more certain reality is to port over the free trial feature that we see in modern wow. You're going to have a lot of players who are going to see the flourishing popularity of Classic WoW on Twitch and Youtube, yet may not want to take the risk of buying BFA for a game that seems incredibly dated upon first glance. The best way to test a new player's curiosity is to give them a slice of the cake, I really hope Blizzard implement's it.

Please say "raid" and not just "pve". It's confusing in Classic and older mmos that haven't muted into what they are today.
---
Back in 06 there were short ingame cinematics for Naxx and patch 1.12
---
I definetely wouldn't mind to see ingame cinematics for the different stages of content.
---
Put yourselves in shoes, developers. - Finance guys
---
This ignores human behaviour, if anything you do the opposite and if a faction inbalance is over 60%, new players to a realm (no characters on that realm) can not create a character on the dominate faction.
---
If it isn't its not true to vanilla 
---

Bag of marbles was great for my tank. I was a total noob and didn't have any trinkets. So when I got that, I used it.

---
Just so other's aren't confused: Cat stun only exists on the Pounce opener ability. Cat has no other stun in Classic.
---
But they can't have the current restrictions, surely? I mean, druids, paladins and shamans all legitimately need cloth gear, for example.
---
Well, if we compare to Blizzard remasters that have been released, we have Starcraft, which would suggest a different price.
---
Original SC Price: $30 or 40([source](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/starcraft/topic/20759006197))
---
Broodwar Price: $30([source](http://classic.battle.net/scc/faq/bw.shtml))
---
Starcraft Remastered: $15([source](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/30/15906204/blizzard-starcraft-remastered-4k-pricing-release-date))
---
It had a CD and was a trinket slot. And if I remember correctly, back in vanilla EVERYTHING worked in pvp and pve. That's why going engineering was so good. You could use all your gadgets in pvp.
---
Yes, it wasn't as free as it is today. All sorts of websites needed accounts and money that I didn't have at 13. Also, websites werent as trustworthy and you'd often get all sorts of malware.
---
ROFL
---
If they can find an honest way to produce loot trading I'd be ok with it.
---
Yes however I see the problem without loot trading as far as a business goes.  The sheer amount of man-hours to resolve loot issues would be crushing.
---
Just yesterday in a SM Cath run on a Pserver the hunter (lol yea) accidentally clicked need on the healer hat with zero other cloth wearers in the group.  Those two started in on trying to figure out how to petition a GM to fix the mistake.   This was just in a mid30s dungeon for a mid 30s piece of loot.  People really take loot upgrades seriously.  Dude was flipping his shit.
---
This would be hundreds (thousands?)  of petitions all day, every day, forever.  It's just not really possible to handle them all.
---
Gotta figure something out with friends double rolling just to pass the loot over to their buddy.
---
Would there be anything to prevent someone creating a website where you can report people? Obviously only showing character names, and perhaps some limits e.g. the character is only listed after three reports by different players over a certain period of time, plus a player can only report a limited amount of people per week or whatever? Have the website show how many times someone has been reported maybe? And make screenshots compulsory? 
---
Obviously open to abuse itself no matter what limits, but would it actually be forbidden in any way?
---
Yes, because their cgi/cinematic team programs a lot of code.
---
Going to a launch party = not being able to play for the first 20 minutes. That's 20 minutes of not playing vanilla wow. No thanks.
---
5 man dungeon loot barely matters. This will RARELY happen.
---
Spend your energy complaining about ACTUAL issues like no cross server bgs and no battlemasters, community.
---
DD is older than WoW.
---
but that would require their marketing team to think outside the lootbox
---
Ya that 5% proc rate! Seeing it proc once every 5 kills.  lol
---
They don't have a gouge?
---
People giving you shit need to calm down...but DD and DoT are *technically* different things.
---
Just want to add to please remember to tip your local scantily clad dancing night elves.
---
I think it's possible for classic to hit those numbers. Blizz hasn't done a lot of marketing yet, but if they do even people who have never played WoW before may be interested in nchecking out the re-release of a game as revolutionizing as WoW was. 
---
I do think those numbers will drop drastically though as people have their fill and leave. 
---
Encounters are more complex and interesting than ever, graphics and art are more beautiful than ever, the cinematics are more jaw dropping than ever.
---
The reason retail wow sucks are decisions that are corporate in nature--mechanics and gameplay design choices. Nothing to do with trailers and whatnot.
---
Pvp servers are all I have ever played on it. It can be frustrating to get camped and what not, but it's so rewarding. Being out questing and suddenly you hear that stealth noise. My heart starts beating faster and I can feel my actual body go into a flight or fight response. No other game makes me feel like that.
---
Ok. Thanks for the lesson on German abbreviations. This sub is a worldwide audience that uses DPS. So in the future it would help everyone else out here reading it. Thank you.
---
True, but my point is that if you are leaning on HS for consistency with colors, you're not going to find it. :D
---
Sure, as long as it's not against blizzard code of conduct policy. I think people underestimate how valuable it is in Vanilla to have a sound server reputation. 
---
Considering Sharding is gonna be a thing, both at the beginning when the game is flooded with players and likely near the end when server populations get spread out.
---
Reputation might not be as impactful as it was back in the day. It might end up like retail WoW and you are likely never to see the same person again.
---
The only reason I can imagine players might not wanna be so callous with monopolizing the loot is that it will be a pain in the ass upsetting players to the point were they leave the instance forcing you to find a replacement.
---
...Unless you have a Warlock, then I guess you can just revolving door new players who get angry and leave after you either hold items hostage for money, or roll on them for friends.
---
Classic WoW will almost certainly foster a dog eat dog mentality as opposed to a mutually beneficially camaraderie, and that will only be exasperated when Guilds, and Friends begin players together.
---
...Of course they will NEED on items that are benefical to their friends, because it can't literally be weeks/months until they see that same item again.   
---
That sounds insanely complicated from a game design perspective for very little return for blizzard.
---
How about we just get classic instead.
---
Turtle soup or other cooking items sell well.
---
The longest graveyard runs I can think of (Alliance side) Are Gnomergon, Deadmines, and Mara. Mara i remember being especially bad, that was probably a 10min wipe recovery.
---
Only thing I could see taking 20 mins is if you died in any of the Dungeons in Blackrock Mountain and fell off chains into lava or something like that.
---
Tbh, most people who I know who want to play classic are not bothered at all about loot trading. Why would we be when we plan to play with each other and not random dickwads who would abuse the loot system for a lvl 15 blue.
---
Everyone who makes these posts screams "I have no social skills and am fully expecting to play with the dregs of the server, please blizzard, protect me."
---
Make so fucking friends and stop planning to play with jerkoff rando's - oh and stop caring about loot you will only have for 2 levels as if it's your grannies fucking pearl earrings that your grandpa's war buddy smuggled out of Auschwitz in his ass. 
---
The only correct class to pick is Dwarf.
---
It's funny how we never ever saw these kind of posts before Classic was announced. People was playing on private servers and was super happy with Vanilla. The only real complaints was when stuff wasn't authentic enough.
---
This is what new gamers don't understand. Game mechanics were put in games for a reason. 
---
It's the stripping of these various mechanics new gamers consider annoying that turned MMORPGs into the watered down crap they are today. The cause of this is more complicated, but this is the end result and it set modern expectations.
---
Any real game that tries to preserve it's concept needs to say, "Deal ... or leave. This is our game."
---
it depends on the class a lot
---
healers and tanks will have a big problem farming on pvp servers
---
stealthers will have a great time
---
I plan on taking /join world as soon as I log into classic. Best place for finding people. 
---
The good news is that the last months of retail Classic before TBC will be more familiar with 1.12 Classic coming. At least before the last prep patch that made everything easy to get.
---
These posts and sentiments were ABSOLUTELY prevalent before Classic was announced. Many popular private servers were dedicated to things exactly like this before Nostalrius came around.
---
&gt;  Its really annoying when you are farming and can't kill the competition on the opposing faction on a PvE realm.
---
then he kills you back and so on and so on so neither of you get shit done
---
Shaman, Mage, Warlock, Priest are all the same colors, while Paladin (pink -&gt; yellow), Rogue (yellow -&gt; black), Warrior (beige -&gt; red), and Druid (orange -&gt; brown) are all different.  50% consistency!
---
Your assumption is people want 50/50 servers.
---
Let me start by saying I don't agree with OP at all.  
---
With that said, dying in north Stonetalon on Horde can be a serious nightmare haha. The run back is foooorrreevvveerrrr 
---
There were some post like this on the PS-reddit. But like heavely modded servers, they never realy got much attention. Most people simply want to play classic as it was. I'm no purist and I have no problems with some small changes but stuff like that would ruin the classic feeling.
---
Apologies if I came across this way... I was just curious what everyone elses take was on this, I personally don't mind.
---
Faction imbalances weren't an issue in vanilla, most servers were 60/40 at the worst iirc. My server was one of the worst and it was only 60/40.
---
To be honest they should just god damn implement personal loot like it is in the main game and just ignore the nay sayers that this is a massive change. Like most if not all current mmos use a personal loot system because group loot has always been crazily broken and unbalanced. 
---
in TBC an addon came out called "EveryQuest" which listed every quest in the zone you're in and whether or not you completed it.  
---
Either TBC or Wrath.  
---
Anyway if they leave the API functionality in again, you should be able to make an addon for it.  
---
Otherwise you can be like me and already have a complete spreadsheet of every quest organized and ready to go.  
---
Yeah. I think it just starts off incredibly slow. I only got him to level 20, ran WC a few times then gave up because I realized I didn‚Äôt like the class. I just found that the Druid could do all these different things, but wasn‚Äôt good at any of them and it felt really limiting, because Druid was literally the last class I played after leveling everything else 1-60. 
---
Agree! It was DD in FFXI which I played prior to getting into WoW. Cmon now, let‚Äôs not split hairs here.  If you knew what he meant don‚Äôt flip out. 
---
Nothing screams "I have no social skills, blizzard please protect me" more than admitting the only groups you'll get into will be full of scumbags that will a use loot trading. 
---
30/0/21 is definitely the spec that fits the billing of what you said, though of course only at 60.  At any level below 60, you will be missing either 5/5 Lightning mastery or NS.  Are you only talking about at 60?
---
Do you have a source for this? I'd like to read it. I've been researching reputation quite heavily since the demo.  
---
The only story I remember is a gnome mage being the first to get a non-faction mount, and it was a sabre. They achieved this via Un'goro soil turn in.  
---
At least the paladins could equip the non-set int mail! DE/vendor fodder for the horde when that int plate dropped :/
---
It's fair to say that we're not talking about repeatable quests in this case.  
---
That's fair, it's more a support class in that sense.
---
It''s right around 20 with catform things start to speed up. With self heals and stealth there's very little downtime.
---
absolutely not
---
I actually grinded Org rep to exalted on the most popular vanilla private server. Even with the inflated reputation values, I only barely hit exalted. I had 3 quests left on my list when I reached exalted.  
---
I have light evidence that suggests you'll be somewhere in the mid honored range with Darnassus by the time you finish Teld, Darkshore, and Ashenvale. I can link it later if necessary.  
---
I'm not saying we need group finder. I'm saying that the awkward majority are going to want one once they realize max level dungeon runs are put together socially.
---
Step 1: Just don't die.
---
Hey guys! Thanks again for the great response to my last video on Rogue Tanking. I guess I'll just keep making these "niche build" videos until I run out of niche builds to make videos for! (Hopefully Classic will be released by then...!)
---
Well blizzard just doesn‚Äôt have the customer representatives like they use to. Heck they recently culled a load like last month. That‚Äôs why loot trading is staying. If it concerns you that people might roll need to give to their friends then perhaps you should advocate for need before greed as well.  The system implemented in cataclysm. 
---
Because private server data isn't perfectly accurate, it's subject to change, but we have optimal specs, gear, rotations, and boss strats mostly figured out. Content is going to be cleared a lot faster than in actual vanilla, I'll tell you what.
---
I knew exactly what you meant when you said DD. Term was used in Everquest all the time 
---
dwuid
---
Yes, knowing about quest lines in Classic is very important.
---
You will find (especially Alliance side), that lower level zones have tons of quick, one time quests or regional chains that are easy to find.
---
Once you start to get to 30+ zones, you run into the issue of many quests having origins from other areas of the world that lead you to other areas (some simple delivery note quests can often be skipped however as they are just meant to lead you to new zones).
---
If you miss some of these long quest chains, you will miss out on sometimes half the quest xp in some zones.
---
Resto?
---
Shadowpriests lol, because every raid has only one. 
---
 /licks
---
I imagine that role tends to be readily filled though, right?
---
My first character way back in 1.3.0 was on a PvE server. Made a PvP character a short time later and never looked back. It's not that frustrating usually.
---
How about need before greed like they had in cataclysm? This‚Äôll prevent classes rolling on gear they can‚Äôt use. 
---
We had slowass Internet and there was no PornHub. You had to download porn through eMule and crap. And half of the porn was garbage!
---
Fuck that.
---
&gt; No out-and-out guarantee of items going to the most worthy player  
---
Main tank is usually geared first in a raiding guild. This is a direct example of items going to the most worthy player. Most raid-minded individuals agree with and support the idea of gearing up your main tank first.  
---
How do you approach that subject with your system?  
---
Obviously. They also compete with other casters for gear so it wasn‚Äôt a super serious suggestion. 
---
out of all places, i was not expecting a r/animemes post to be crossposted here
---
Yes, we're leaps ahead of where we were years ago. That's a lot of time to innovate and improve on strategies. An example that springs to mind is how Feral Druids are now very viable Main Tank's in speedrunning raid comps. Someone figured out that by farming a shit ton of [Manual Crowd Pummeler's](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) you can pull some crazy high TPS numbers enabling your DPS to play without holding back. It's a level 29 blue item farmed in Gnomergan, nobody knew this back in the day.
---

---
hmm lemme compare a bunch of games with a 1 time purchase fee and no subscription fees to an ongoing 15 dollar monthly subscription fee game....
---
what an apt comparison!!
---
Same. I still think they should have gone with an initial price for the game too to make the launch smoother and spread out the tourist influx, but it is what it is. 
---
Yeah, Loot Trading isn't acceptable in Need/Greed, plus GMs never helped you in Need/Greed situations.
---
It should be acceptable in Master Looter raids. I don't do pugs, so this doesn't affect me, but still--I understand some people will likely prefer those. So for their sake, it should only be possible to trade with the Master Looter. This means it's impossible for anyone but the Master Looter to hold the raid hostage.
---
You are probably right. There probably is not any benefit to bring more than 2 Resto Druids.
---
Only kind you‚Äôll find in a raid. 
---
I feel like DKP as a system was outdated even in the later days of vanilla. I can definitely see guilds using a loot council in conjunction with class leaders and other officers instead.
---

Wtf is that link??? 8.5 dps????
---
I'd say gearing the MT and OT are the only exceptions to the rule, as they are integral to progression. This exception is included in the loot rules posted on the guild website/discord etc, everyone's fully aware of what's going on and there's nothing behind the scenes.
---
Amen.

---
With Classic WoW coming out in just a few months, I wanted to start putting together a group of people. Some of this group is made up of friends that I‚Äôve made over the years of playing games. But we are also looking for new players to join our group.
---
What faction will we be choosing?
---
-Duh, Horde.
---
Ok so we are playing classic, that means we will be using vent right?
---
-As much as we all ‚Äú loved ‚Äú vent, Discord will be our chosen VC
---
What server will we be playing on?
---
-Once they announce the servers, this will be updated with the chosen server. It will be a PvP server.
---
What is our goal as a guild!
---
-To be honest, we aren‚Äôt 100% sure. We want to get a group of people together so we can all experience Classic for the first time or a second time and have fun doing it. We want to level, we want to dungeon, we want to craft and we want to gather. Getting to max and doing raids is/may be a small goal. It takes time to level and we want to enjoy every step along the way. If we get the people together and we can try raids that would be great as well!
---
We want to make a community that is strong and offers value to everyone. If you want to be a part of a team and help build something great, reply here or send me a message on Discord. Ulteir#4409.
---
You're that entitled cunt that this whole thread is meaning about.
---
Yeah. 20 min? Where in the world did u die to have to run 20 min? üòÇ
---
And I look forward to all of the complaints about how combat may feel different especially in pvp duels. 
---
How well Blizzard emulates the real Classic feel will be interesting to see when using this newer engine.
---
Just a tiiiiiiiiny bit maybe :p
---
Or, to quote Frank Reynolds, "Hoors".
---
Best Classic content creator and it's not even close.
---
http://huhuranisserious.ytmnd.com/
---
Really dislike dkp/lc and this sounds pretty good.
---
It'd just snowball. If a server has 53% horde and 47% alliance, people who roll horde will roll on it and unbalance it even more, while alliance players will avoid it.
---
Most guilds on pservers still use DKP. 
---
LC is just too much of hassle when you have 40 people. Only the really hardcore guilds tend to use in order to maximize raid dps
---
This is part of the game in Vanilla. You don‚Äôt have any guarantees in this life either. 
---
I think that depends on what games they've been playing. In comparison to mobile games which are very shallow, yeah classic wow is awesome. But if they've been console games the past 10 years, it's going to be hard to compare the modern graphics and systems of current-day console games to Classic Wow.
---
These quests are part of the most used vanilla guide there is, lol. 
---
yup I remember them! happy to see ya hope things are looking good for classic for ya
---
Yeah, personally I say leave it in ML situations only or maybe even just raids only. People will be careful about who they let be the Master Looter in raids if they know there is nothing they can do about loot mistakes.
---
2 million is a bit of a stretch and would be an incredible success. 20 million is just pulling a number out of your ass for a clickbait title. No, 'because fortnite/apex legends' is not a good argument for why a 14 year old mmo will suddenly get 50% more subscribers than any sub mmo ever has before in history.
---
Might find a feral tank but even after the good work done by Taladril, it's going to be rare.
---
I still have my TBC collectors edition right on my shelf.
---
I'm not even sure Classic had one back in the day. I don't even remember day 1 launch well. I played Classic for nearly 6 months in beta. 
---
Goddamn, I remember TBC launch well though. Camped Walmart for the edition with about 5 others at the door, while a HUGE lineup stood at the door of the Future Shop (our Best Buy back then where I live) only 2 blocks away.
---
Walmart opened earlier too, so we drove by the Future Shop line holding up out collectors boxes in the window of the car.
---
I'm guessing you are talking about the quest where you have to have some sort of speed boost to jump over to reach the dwarf? 
---
If you jump down in the water just below there is a letter that also provides a quest with some good experience, I've almost never met players that know about that one. 
---
Main tanks are the only ones really funneled gear. Last dkp guild I was in warlocks and druids had the most dkp, but that's mainly because gear they wanted wasn't dropping  The best gear is shared by multiple classes and even tier gear in aq and naxx is shared.
---
Oh ok that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Yeah the hidden quest that requires some good parkour skills. 
---
I also seem to remember that profs back in the day gave you small stat buffs? Like skinning gave you an extra 1% to crit. Am I remembering this right?
---
What happens if some items simply aren‚Äôt rolled on? Kind of like what happens to less desirable items that don‚Äôt get bid on in a dkp system. 
---
Also, how and who gets to decide when the system is being cheated? How could ‚Äúyou‚Äù be objective in deciding when someone‚Äôs +rolls no longer come into play? 
---
I very well may have misunderstood something, if I did by all means correct me. It is an interesting idea though, and kudos for the creativity.
---
hORRIBLE
---
&gt; I'm under the impression that raids typically bring about 8 shamans
---
They don't, but they *want* to. That's why they're the most desired class is in raiding.
---
I'm a bit scared of this because I'm so used to dungeon finder and no one talking that there will absolutely take getting used to being a bit more social. But I look forward to it SO much. 
---
no thx
---
Man, I get into arguments all the damn time over on the WoW subreddit with people who cannot even fathom the idea of community. They don‚Äôt want to join a guild, they don‚Äôt want to make friends. All they want to do is queue for dungeons and raids, talk to no one, and get loot. 
---
That‚Äôs not an exaggeration at all. There are a lot of people who want WoW to be as single player as possible and thing everyone else is just an obstacle to their loot. It makes me so mad. Like, why the fuck are you actively trying to change an MMO into a single player game when there are SO MANY SINGLE PLAYER GAMES OUT THERE?
---
Good MMOs are few and far between yet we have this cancer of player who wants to destroy it. All the people that bitched and moaned about blizzard removing portals in the most recent update are a prime example of people who just don‚Äôt get it. 
---
The guy I'm replying to is talking almost exclusively about other repeatable quests...
---
This is such misinformation! Go YouTube Shedothedruid topping meters in BWL/AQ as cat dps, or the druids tanking numerous bosses in Naxx. Druids can actually perform every role at a high level
---
Hell even private servers put out some pretty damn good hype videos for at least some patch roll outs. Nothing in game though.
---
Seeing one in game upon 1st launch after patching would be cool.
---
This. Pretending otherwise is incredibly naive. For every person interested in being the underdog there are 10 who'll just join the winning team. It's just our nature.
---
Yeah thinking people won't just flock to the path of least resistance is naive as hell...
---
Bingo.  Especially this time around i could see it being even worse, too.  People dont have the time to dedicate to getting ganked for hours on end.  The playerbase arent a bunch of people in their teens/college. Its people that are in their 30s (and older) that have careers, families, etc.
---
Hunter and Druid are the two that come to mind that it's unlikely that raids will want to bring more than 2-4 of.
---
Hopefully that happens far less, if at all, as you have far less to gain by passing on an item that's an upgrade. If as guild leaders you felt it was becoming a detriment, you could remove the variable that encourages it. 
---
There's no being objective in setting out rules but instead of dealing with the subjectivity for each item like in LC you'd deal with it once with an open discussion including or at least being transparent to the whole guild. 
---
Back in the early WOTLK days, the *same-server-only* dungeon finder was how I made friends.  I was a tank, and a good one, so after the random grouped dungeon I would invite some or all people to stay for another or two.  Eventually I had a core group to run heroics with whenever I felt like it (now only using the LFG for maybe a spare DPS), and we joined a guild together, and it was great.
---
This and needing boes binds them would stop a lot of it. Most items don't vendor for that much especially compared to their AH value so it would deter a lot of the problems imo.
---
To be fair, the cinematic team probably doesn't have anything to do with the actual development of classic wow. Not saying your point is wrong, because I agree they do need to focus, but in this case I don't think it's bad actually ü§î
---
I'm obnoxious because I'm telling you the exact truth of the situation?
---
ok w/e
---
GOOD point
---
I remember being excited when first looting rotting bear carcass. 1.68s!
---
Just sit with her at the character creation screen and answer her questions. When she picks one just explain it to her then let her decide for herself. My friend INSISTED that I play a hunter when I first started back in the day, got to level 10 and didn't like it then went back and rolled Paladin cause it looked so cool to me and well, here I am.
---
Negatives:  
---
It ignores how much it will help raid (eg gearing main tank &gt; that lucky ret paladin)  
---
It's not as straightforward as other alternatives (raiders will complain)  
---
People will argue that others bought loot  
---
People might still pass on needing so they can accumulate those +3s  
---
A good loot council &gt; a good loot system
---
The main issue with this is how much world pvp is in classic compared to retail and previous expansions. A lot of people could choose to roll on a faction dominant server specifically because they have less chance of being ganked. Rip their PvP ranks, but some people really don't care for it anyways
---
&gt;  You roll need, then you notice the warrior tank also rolling need... and the hunter and everyone else. The tank wins it, 
---
Screenshot that, post in /Trade that he's a ninja. Report him to his guild.
---
You obviously play with bad players, and obviously don't play priest. It's fine man, just dont give bad advice when you cant do math and dont play the class. 
---
I gotcha, you counter the potential negative with complete transparency, thank you for elaborating! 
---
lol nice.
---
I don't talk with randoms more than necessary even on private servers tbh. Too many get way too clingy after we've already finished the dungeon. 
---
You tag a mob by doing any amount of damage to it. 
---
The mob will be greyed out to anyone not on your group.
---
People not in your group can still kill the mob, but only you and people in your group will get xp and loot from that mob.
---
I agree with you. I often talk about this with people around me, and usually the answers I get are ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs faster, I don‚Äôt want to take 20 mins to group up‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just want to get the dailies ASAP before bed, not here to chat‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, they want instant fun, instant gratification, time is of the essence. But relationships are built upon time. Which goes against the former.
---
Low level alt and a lvl 60 friend.  The low level 'tags' the mob with any spell or attack which makes the target only reward the low level alt.  The 60 is now free to one shot the mob and all the xp and rep will go to the alt.  
---
Works best with classes who have low cost instant damage abilities.  
---
How does it handle inflation? And how do you fairly determine modifiers? Is helping people once give you the same modifier then helping half the team all day long? How would that be determined fairly?
---
Biggest risk I feel with this if the + Modifier does not have clear cut and defined values it's basically an indirect loot-council. Also it could be quite frustrating for people that just do more to help the raid succeed to have the same chance as somebody who just does the bare minimum.
---
I think the key to getting exalted with the primary city factions is not focusing on just that one faction, but rather completing all faction quests at the appropriate level, to maximize spillover reputation to the other factions at the same time. This assumes that Classic will implement spillover rep, because some private servers do and others don‚Äôt, but apparently the demo last year did.
---
For instance, if you earn around 20,000 Darnassus rep from the first two Night Elf zones, then you could expect to get as much as 5,000 spillover Ironforge rep from those same quests. This all depends upon how early spillover rep begins (I‚Äôve read that starter zone quests may not give spillover rep) and how long spillover rep lasts (it could stop as soon as the end of honored or maybe halfway into revered).
---
Regardless of how spillover rep is implemented, I‚Äôve started working on an Alliance quest completionist guide on my site that directs you from zone to zone, allowing you to complete every single faction quest before it goes gray for maximum possible reputation so you can more easily achieve exalted with your preferred faction, as well as the other three factions at the same time. The guide is Rogue-specific, but the general questing path is still pretty much the same for other classes.
---
Those aren't his videos. Someone else makes them out of his Twitch highlights and he neither promotes nor endorses them.
---
I would sure hope not. Even if they did, you can't just need everything and trade it to your bros because it would all get bound to you anyway.
---
They may be well articulated but they are all completely dumb. EVERY single abuse you can do with loot trading you can easily do without. The GMs were more than happy to transfer items as long as the person who got the item was the one who made the ticket.
---
Loot trading does nothing but make this behavior easier to notice, and reduce tickets so that when people actually need help they dont have to wait nearly as long. If you dont have loot trading a majority of tickets will be item transfers.
---
There isnt a single good reason not to use loot trading.
---
Loot councils are best when they're good, but the worst when they're bad. With DKP, you get a predictable level of bad
---
If a warrior rolled on a  caster item and won, he would be shunned by the community just like any other ninja looter. Isn't this exactly what we say is so great about vanilla, that your reputation follows you around and actually has consequences?
---
The scenario you mentioned will not be a big deal, because these people would be blacklisted like any other ninja. The issue is when two or players who actually can use the item, and one of them unequips his item of similar or better value, then trades it to his mate. This would be solved with a time limit and a notification to every member of the group. 
---
This is why blind bid dkp and dkp decay exsist. 
---
Whith blind dkp bids the only way to guarantee a winning bid is to have more dkp than anyone else and to bid all of it.
---
And dkp decay punishes people for hoarding it. The more you have, the more you lose.
---
Do any of them use Suicide Kings system?
---
Survival/MM is my favorite hunter spec too. I even level as survival if it's an alt I can twink as it's gear dependent more so than BM (by a lot).
---
I was also a druid in vanilla. 30-39 is the best bracket for druid pvp. 
---
Loot trading works great with personalized loot in d3. Maybe no loot trading is not the answer but rather personalized loot.
---
I dislike the LFG automatic finder thing. 
---
However I DID love the little list finder for finding mythic groups. They should absolutely keep that. It was a bit of a middle ground between the tedious old style of finding groups and the overly streamlined LFG style. 
---
This spillover situation will be unique to Classic, since it was introduced a bit later down the vanilla pipeline. I believe exalted will be possible, but the fact is no one has actual proof because the real rep numbers per quest aren't known.  
---
With that said, the fact that you're building that website in the first place is a testament to how difficult it will be.  
---
God I remember waiting an hour or two for one video just to download and it not even been worth spanking too.
---
The real porn was the pictures that would slowly load from top to bottom. Man, that would really get ya goin.
---
Why would they? To them it's a feat and it's what they love to do. The whole point is that it isn't easy to raid in naxx because it requires DEDICATION and when you are dedicated it takes MENTAL STAMINA to see it to the end. It's like getting in shape not everyone can dedicate time to it and have the mental stam to go through with it. 
---
Why are you getting so defensive about this as if it's a personal attack. I'm sorry you didn't have the dedication to see your guild through in naxx 40 maybe classic will be your second chance bud. 
---
Oh shit my bad. I got the threads mixed up.
---
Tanks.
---
MUUUUUUH BUT BUUURST DMG!
---
I'm sure some do, but SK works better in casual guilds imo
---
Yea np shit happens :)
---
Good old 'You spank it, you tank it'.
---
I downvoted you for making a needless edit whining about your invisible internet points 
---
And then I made a reply about it 
---
At least she still has those huge tits.
---
I'm curious, why two monitors?
---
If you are struggling to figure out what DD could stand for in the context he laid out, It sounds more like a personal problem than his problem. 
---
I'm only saying this because you're attitude comes off real douchey over a fuckin abbreviation,  lol. 
---
Certain items are just far better for some classes and specs than others. In your system ill literally roll on everything i can equip even sidegrades. In dkp im not going to waste dkp on sidegrades and lc isnt going to give it to me over someone else.
---
I‚Äôm not German and I knew what he meant immediately. 
---
It's a role for GM's girlfriend. 
---
You can use one, but you don't really need one. And if you need that Shadow weaving you would rather have Holy/Weaving or PI/Weaving hybrid priest.
---
Try this instead: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPMTM3AABDTxDEA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPMTM3AABDTxDEA)
---
On the Resto side: You don't need Healing Focus when you have Eye of the Storm. You also do not cast Healing Wave with this spec (mostly Chain Heal in raids with Lesser Healing Wave to spot heal; only Lesser Healing Wave when solo and in PvP) so you don't need the cast time reduction. And 5/5 Tidal Mastery is a must - it's a damage talent in the Resto tree!
---
On the Elemental side: Only thing I did was replace 3/3 Call of Flame with 3/3 Elemental Warding. Searing Totem is used while soloing, but 15% extra damage on Searing Totem is pretty pathetic. It hits for 40 to 55 damage every 2 seconds untalented, or 46 to 63 damage every 2 seconds talented. That's 3-4 DPS at the cost of 3 talent points. On the other hand: 10% elemental magic damage reduction is huge. MC (fire), BWL (fire), AQ (nature), and Naxx (frost) all prominently feature those schools of magic. In PvP, it's basically a flat 10% damage reduction against Mages - which you need because your mail armor does nothing to protect against them.
---
99% of people wont farm the crowd pummelers
---
My experience on Pservers, with guilds and groups who have discords, were great. You could ask in trade, or ask your guild if anyone had anything going, and the fellas who would normally be organising pugs always had discords you could just hop into and see If anything was going on. 
---
The point is, because of the community, you know who the people are. I knew the Gnome Warrior who would stand on the IF Bridge and advertise for pugs every Friday-Sunday. He was a troll, and from Europe, but he led good pugs and in my experience with him, he was always fair with loot. (I forgot his name now, it's been a year or so) 
---
But it's the community. I still remember that particular dude, and there were many others. You can be a known person to the entire server, for either good or bad. You start to learn who the good players are, the talented and geared tanks/healers/dps, who is in the "best" guilds, etc. 
---
It is not like that anymore. I miss running into a dude who happened to be running by while i am a low level struggling with mobs and he saves my skin, and then I end up in a raid with that dude. 
---
Are boobs included?
---
I'd love to see it. I'm still planning my route and I'd like to do it again. I have a simple excel sheet and by PServer rep rates it's totally doable by the time you're in the middle of Feralas. 
---
Imagine this: you're a low level druid, with a 60 rogue helping you. Rogue kills a mob that would give you 1000xp. Because the rogue is 60, you'll end up getting like 200xp as a penalty for his level.
---
Alternatively, you're not in a group with the rogue. You moon fire that same 1000xp mob. It's not "tagged" to you. Rogue kills it in one shot. According to the game, only you killed it. You get the full 1000xp, and only you get the loot.
---
So now, you run thru an area, tab, moon fire, tab, moon fire, tab, moon fire, and the rogue kills everything for you, so you're basically doing tab, kill, tab, kill as far as the experience you get is concerned.
---
Unfortunately there's a unique exception for the five second rule where mana regen cannot tick until channeling ends. So when spamming starshards mana is never regenerated.
---
I think anything outright labeled as a Collectors Edition is a sham for a made in china cloth map.
---
Shaman healing is brain dead easy. You basically target one of the tanks and press Chain Heal until the boss is dead.
---
Totems give you something to actually think about in 5 mans in PvP. In raids, totems are a lot less dynamic (i.e. you know which ones you're going to drop, when you're going to drop them, and where you're going to drop them before the fight even starts) - the only thing you need to do is remember to drop them every 2 minutes.
---
The time where u can become an outcast for rolling need..... counting the days
---
Also this lol
---
screenshots will be needed
---
Found the reason nobody bothers to talk.
---
crowd pummelers were not a thing in Vanilla, but bear tanks were
---
My favorite was a hybrid approach.  DKP with Loot Council oversight and guidance.
---
What class are you going to play? Honestly shaman or paladin. Both easy classes that are pretty forgiving and if there are 2 of you she can focus on healing you as you chainpull. 
---
Also, the Ahn'Qiraj War Effort questline (and the rare mount at the very end) might be rendered impossible for you, because the streamer will get lots of help from his fans, which will accelerate it, and he'll be way ahead and he's gonna ring the gong while everyone else isn't even anywhere close to finishing. Or at least, that's what i think and what i've heard. 
---
What 20 minute corpse run? When go you swimming laps around zones with no beaches? When you jump off fucking Teldrassil? If you get a 20 minute corpse run, you did something to deserve it.
---
The second part of my comment was how vanilla didn't have the ubiquitous skin/portrait/store integration live does and we shouldn't encourage that. Any response there?
---
Also, help me out here, but the collectors edition that the OP was about, how does that impact the sub price?
---
Uhm none is forcing you ? Classic WoW is subscrption only you don‚Äôt need to buy it.
---
If we're talking like the first few days of launch... I shouldn't be telling you this because I don't want competition, but... fishing.
---
Yep, fishing. Get to a certain skill level and fish for certain junk in a certain goblin port... vendors pay nicely for bolts of cloth and leather...
---
You're sitting with 10g after a few hours of farming and then you can start flipping the AH. Buy Feet of the Lynx for less than 1g in the first week and sell it a few weeks later for 20-40g.
---
I've said too much.
---
&gt; Any real game that tries to preserve it's concept needs to say, "Deal ... or leave. This is our game."
---
Colloquially known as "git gud"
---
There is also the escort type quest on the beaches of Azshara.
---
&gt;implying you'll even be able to get past character creation without servers crashing 
---
 Bless.
---
Thanks guys I get it now üëç
---
The way they changed it makes a lot of sense. I never noticed how it worked in legion but what you're saying makes sense. If someone needs it, it is soulbound even for BoE. That kind of clears up a lot of problems.   
---
So basically what you're saying is, only if you greed does the system work... Why is everyone freaking out then?
---
Frankly, the same abuses can occur in raiding pugs, which contrary to popular belief, happen from MC all the way to tier 3.
---
But at least that's a far smaller subsection of social interactions that would be potentially hurt.
---
Guildies can all will on something and steal it from the pug players. You really think the pig players will know what every guildie has as loot? 
---
The ideal solution is a no tolerance solution for loot mistakes, but at this point most people aren't expecting ideal solution from Activision Blizzard.
---
They did wonderfully fix the content release schedule, though, so there is hope.
---
My favorite world boss memory is from Nostalrius. Azuregos is up in Azshara and the top Horde and Alliance guild are vying for the tag and kill, which basically means fucking World War Three. Eventually Alliance got the tag and started making real progress on killing him, so a hunter guildie of mine got aggro on Azuregos and kited him to the bridge, far enough for him to reset. He was a hell of a troll. One time he named his hunter pet after our main tank which fucked up all the healer macros since they had his name hardcoded. fucking lmao
---
This is a common misconception. The point isn't to combat ninjas. It's to fix loot mistakes. Like the wrong warrior getting the shield.
---
Funny you say that when I've seen only a handful of guilds using DKP like DBC and the vast majority using LC.
---
DD is not even just a German thing, it means Damage Dealer. Im not even sure why that isn't used internationally. Much simpler concept imo
---
That was later on (WotLK maybe?).
---
aren't*
---
you're*
---
German*
---
"So?" isn't a complete sentence.
---
You could say that I'm being pedantic and that I knew what you meant so it doesn't really matter, but then you'd have to admit the same about the post you were replying to.
---
We talking about the arena chest, yah?
---
Will it launch every 3 hours like in the past, and if so, guess it'll be interesting to see if it drops 3 hours after severs go up, or if it'll be on the 3 hour mark, like servers go up at 8am, but 9am is the first chest. 
---
The arena is one of my favorite old parts of the game. Hearing the announcement in chat (as I recall?) was so fun. Somehow still never got a chest in all my years. 
---
Thanks for mentioning this cause I didn't even think of how good a reward it would be to get the first one on the server with gold being of such value! 
---
I'm guessing this is an announcement they are holding off from making until closer to launch. Hopefully they announce the tough luck approach and bfa casuals can go cry in trade... or we get fucked and they lose alot of people who will play for more than a month 
---
I agree it is a flawed mechanic. Instead you shouldn't be able to corpse run at all. Rather unless resurrected within 5 minutes you should end up in the main city hospital where you are automatically resurrected, then run from there alive.
---
Had quite a similar experience with a in game friend back in the day. Definitely check out vanilla friends as was linked. It was like they died when they never logged in and most people weren't connecting heavily on social media type platforms then. I had that friends email but he never responded. Crazy the friends you can make in the game!
---
On a side note, my now 7 year RL friend I met on WoW. He lives in Sweden and I have been there three times in 4 years, and he has come to the states once. Combined like 4-5 months hanging out..it's been a riot! Thanks WoW
---
I'm giving you reasons why most people don't even try Naxx, you're giving me the DEDICATION speech as if we're talking about a simple 1.5 hours a day to get in shape lmao. I'm not getting defensive brother, I'm disagreeing with you, it's not really a weird concept.
---
For reals or trolling? Is the leather just worth more copper per item than is usual? 
---
Also in order to execute this people need to be carrying around an entire extra trash set constantly because you are unsure what will drop, which frankly seems unlikely. 
---
... you do realize that DD stands for damage dealer right? It's an english abreviation lmao
---
They say DD because there isn't a great translation for damage per second into German. Schaden pro Sekunde is the best I've heard but it's super awkward and no one says it... like at all. Damage dealer is a much more normal way of a German speaker voicing the concept.
---
All loot being final is a VERY REAL  and effective way of dealing with the ‚ÄúPennies‚Äù issue. Having a GM fix loot in actually Vanilla WoW was incredibly rare. The GM‚Äôs also kept track of how many times the same person attempted this, and would deny the ticket if this was an repeated issue with said person. 
---
I can promise you having GM‚Äôs restore loot (before any of the expansions came out) was much less common for the majority of the player base. Part of this game is sometimes losing out on loot, it happens.  WoW Classic‚Äôs integrity nor the GM‚Äôs time should be jeopardized because people can‚Äôt figure out an incredibly easy loot system.

You obviously don't understand what I wanted to say you fucking dum dum, i was implying that rest of us shouldn't know retarded german slangs, you probably call deadmines VC lul
---
i mean tbh we're arguing over something so unimportant that i can't even, but then again you went full grammar nazi(what a coincidence eh) so i had to reply.
---
Why is it so important to you that, if I play an MMO, I *must* play it your way?  Why is your way of playing MMO's the only acceptable one?  There are video games that are for teams, there are video games that are single player, and then there are video games like WoW where you can do either, and switch from one to the other when your friends log on.
---
I'm happy that in "modern" MMO's let you play alone when you want without being arbitrarily gimped.  And Classic WoW was the MMO that showed that game mechanics forcing people to group as the only viable play style was not, actually, a good business model.

I think med leather is 1s per piece 
---
EZ throw dyn no mite bay bee!

Except it‚Äôs not. There was no loot trading in vanilla.
---
Silver? Silver!? Hell yah. 
---
Thanks :) 
---
I would assume that the event is set up for the usual mechanics. 12 3 6 and 9
---
I don't think you understand what I was trying to say, actually. 
---
I knew what you were trying to say. And you knew what the other person was trying to say.
---
That was my point. We all know what each other is trying to say, even if the words might not be exactly "right" or what you're used to.
---
Thinking of it now, silly me. If it started other than regular times then it would be on an irregular time until next server shut down/they adjusted it, so let's assume you're correct. 
---
Druids put out higher TPS than Warriors even without a Manual Crowd Pummeler. Feral Druid viability comes from having 1.12 mechanics + talents for the entirety of Classic. If we were starting with 1.1 mechanics, then Feral Druids wouldn't even be close to viable, even though Manual Crowd Pummelers were in the game at that point.
---
On that note: I think the most important thing is that we know exactly what we're going to get and when we're going to get it. Going back to Druids: in actual Vanilla, there was an entire year+ where every Druid needed 31 points in Resto to take Innervate. Then they suddenly got Innervate baseline, talents were changed, and in every patch after that at least some of their mechanics were changed. They end result was exactly the same as we're going to get now, but people were already set in their ways and didn't have time to adjust before the expansion came out.
---
We don't have to figure that stuff out. We aren't set in our ways. We can start over and we know what we're getting in advance. That's the biggest difference.
---
1)The tank is rolling need on a caster staff. The tank is a ninja. Report the tank in trade and don‚Äôt play with the tank anymore. 2) That piece of loot probably will only matter for a small fraction of your played time. Get over it and move on. 3) Seems like this same thing could have happened in vanilla by just opening a ticket with a GM. 
---
I see, yes that makes quite some sense. Thanks for the detailed answer! :)
---
Maybe one follow-up on this: What would the stat priority for such a hybrid build look like? MP5 &gt; Int &gt; +Heal &gt; Crit? And I guess it would be goodto have some +Spelldmg gear for PvP and farming?
---
Going Horde because it's what I've played since TBC and, y'know, Orcs. 
---
But man, I'll be missing the Elwynn &gt; Westfall &gt; RR &gt; Duskwood &gt; STV run. Was truly epic 15 years ago, and still my favorite questing hubs to this day.
---
Alright, thanks for the confirmation! Right, that's for level 60. During leveling I'm thinking some enh+resto mix is more efficient.
---
This is gold.
---
Wetlands. Unpopular, I know, but the zone is butt ugly and it has no memorable quests.
---
I think that we should all come together as a community and make sure Blizz knows that Loot Trading is not okay. Unfortunately, it will probably be in no matter what we do, so if that's the case, we should all aggressively report entire parties as ninja looters if need be and blacklist them, both on this sub and in the forums and obviously in-game. Maybe we can discourage people from doing this even if loot trading remains in the game.
---
He always ignores the slightest criticism
---
I tested this on a private server. So that this for what it's worth.
---
It basically didn't work. You can get the same results with better mana regen using the wand build.
---
This attitude is awful for the guild and for your guildies though.. Are you really going to fuck the community in such a community based game? 
---
It's gonna suck though due to limited taunts and spell hit
---
It doesn't--since people can still need roll, receive it from the Master Looter, and then say, "okay folks, now selling Bindings for 5k, any takers?"
---
Make it so you can only trade loot with the Master Looter himself. That way, the Master Looter **must** be complicit in the act. If the Master Looter is complicit, then that's absolutely no different than a vanilla pug master looter going "oh, look, bindings. Okay, forget need/greed, whoever can cough up 5k gets it."
---
&gt;5 Extra Attacks
---
It actually only stacks to 4 extra attacks, so you get the Initial swing, plues 4 more hits. For a total of 5 hits.
---
This was great! 
---
Ended up sending me down a bit of a nostalgia rabbit hole that I recommend to others too: [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Long,\_exceptional,\_or\_hidden\_questlines](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Long,_exceptional,_or_hidden_questlines)
---
MT has priority for tanking gear 
---
Stop speaking for me. I like loot trading.
---
&gt; You're a healer, lets say priest or druid, and notice that a group of people need a healer for deadmines. You shift click their name and see they are level 20. You get into the group and notice a couple other level 20's and a level 16 mage. Nothing drops for you the whole instance and then that's when it happens, the emberstone staff drops. You roll need, then you notice the warrior tank also rolling need... and the hunter and everyone else. The tank wins it, you're feeling a mix of bad emotions as you see him walk over the level 16 mage and stand by him for a bit before leaving and carrying on with the dungeon then you realize it was a group of people running their friend through the instance and they all just cheated you out of a fair chance of getting loot, and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
And without loot trading... that same group simply switches to masterlooter as VC dies and loots the staff to their friend. Same outcome.
---
People who are going to be ninjas will just use master looter: It's more effective. In your scenario, you still have a 20% chance to win the staff vs 4 friends. With master looter, you have exactly 0%.
---
Plenty of pugs use master looting. The ability to just swap to ML as a boss dies also exists.
---
Please please please stop this retardation.
---
Ok but GM's fixing the loot were in vanilla.
---
I rolled mal'ganis a couple months into classic because my friends where there. Being on the "strong" side of a I'm balanced server had some benefits. I think people forget how hard it couple be to get through to MC and BWL when there's 2-3 raids of the opposite faction around. That always almost never an issue as horde on mal'ganis.
---
However, gathering when you can almost never kill your competition kinda sucked. Watching bots and terribly geared players snipe my nodes was annoying. Trying to rank with hour+ battle ground queues was a bit of a shit show. I'd actually really like to play on a reasonably balanced server this time through.
---
Ahh fuck. You know I actually looked this up to clarify (I couldn't remember whether it was 5 in total or 5 extra, so I consulted [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Reckoning\_Bomb](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Reckoning_Bomb) \- but I think the wording their is poor). I originally thought it was 1 + 4 (for 5 total) too dammit and only switched 'cause of the wording on that wiki page
---
I know in wotlk mining have you increased stamina and things like that idk if it‚Äôs as far back as classic though
---
The problem with this thinking is the rewarding parts of vanilla were never advertised. They advertised an average looking mmo with average ideas about dungeons and leveling, all of the depth of the game is hidden underneath the surface, no pun intended. The smoothness of mechanics like movement, cast bars, animation canceling, being able to select an enemy(i came from runescape), the quest log, the balance of time investment vs skill needed to complete parts of the game. I couldn't see any of those things the day I first played the game. I think the biggest allure is now the veterans creating hype and now you can be a part of the "in-crowd" and play the "real" version of wow, not the pet battle facebook free loot version that is softcore all classes can dps etc. People love being in the cool kids group. 
---
I have a source that says otherwise who's used this as a levelling build up to level 46 on Elysium, level 30 on Light's Hope, and level 25 on Symmetry.  [https://symmetrywow.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45](https://symmetrywow.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45) Which server did you do your testing?
---
If you're paying retail consider making a human and heading over to Redridge. I think you'll like John J. Keeshan.

Your assumption of what a person can or cannot do marathon wise is extremely flawed. I‚Äôve done a couple of 72 hour marathons and I plan on doing another when classic launches but I plan and prepare accordingly so marathons like that will be uncommon.
---
18 hours a day is really not difficult to maintain its just monotonous and requires a person to have the time avaialable and be motivated.
---
As for 12 hours a day, that really easy for any gaming nerd to accomplish (and most done so already on many occasions). Suicidal? Lol
---
Stop using "but teh ninjasaq21qwsa2111!!!" as a shit crutch argument against loot trading. Master looter is far more effective for being a ninja than loot trading.
---
Everyone is mentioning doing IF quests and turning in runecloths, forgetting that the cheapest mount in the game is the AV ram, and you can get the rep needed in a week or two.
---
Agree.
---
Not to mention emberstone staff is actually a solid 2hander for it's level.

The truth is that life isn't fair so we should just accept it and not highlight the issues and possible solutions... yes that's an obnoxious argument.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
I checked on vanilla friends a few times since I found out about it, no luck with my closer friends.
---
I did find a few old guildies, no one I knew well though.
---
Not having loot trading will result in more man power required in form of customer services, something which has just been significantly cut down on. If they have said loot trading being in the game, it's going to remain that way costing the business less money. 
---
All your questions will be answered in different ways by different guilds which I think is the beauty of this system.

Except there was, it was just done via gm tickets.

The "dead server" issue has existed for almost 15 years and affected hundreds of thousands of players. Why are you so entitled that you think Blizzard should suddenly do something for YOU that they did not do for all of the players that came before you?
---
The writing is on the wall and has been there for years. Now I can pat you on the head and say "keep trying", or treat you like an adult and let you know that maybe you should pick a fight that you have a chance of winning.
---
If I were in your shoes, I think it would be obnoxious for someone to patronize me.

In raids, MP5 is very good, but it has almost no value outside of raids because fights are much shorter. Bonus healing is always good. If I were doing it again, I would prioritize bonus healing over all else and get my regen from consumables.
---
For PvP and soloing, I had great success wearing mail pieces with +Nature damage in almost every slot + Hand of Edward the Odd (world drop BoE) + the shield with the most armor that you can find. Elemental is not a raid spec so no one is paying big bucks for nature damage gear. You can find some really good pieces for cheap. My helm with 40 nature damage is more than you could find on any other piece in the game. You won't have much stamina with this setup so it's important to wear mail gear and a good shield in order to take a hit.

There will be a lot of mages, on the other hand groups and raids will want a lot of mages.

People have been enslaved for hundreds of years and the people in power has done nothing to help so what makes you entitled to think that anyone should be free you now?

Yeah I know bringing in slavery is low hanging fruit, I just wanna highlight the obnoxiousness of your argument. And btw i am one of the ones who played on a dead server and it sucks having your character that you've invested so much time in being held hostage, "pay up or start over".

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard dd, but it makes more sense than dps. A designated damage class or damage per second class... what about a ranged fight and a melee class, or even a mate who‚Äôs focusing on CC. It makes more sense to be DD. 
---
Wish you showed it
---
Only 10 hours?
---
That's among my favorites as well. Great choice.
---
Because it kills the other way? If the game is optimized to be "also played as a single player", it stops being an MMO in its heart (see: this post image). And it's all the other players that actually like MMOs that get "gimped".
---
Also who (of the players) gives a damn fuck about a good business model. Are you defending companies to make anti-consumer decisions, because they have to because of business model? Even though you, as a player, would enjoy the game more otherwise? This is what is killing the gaming business, because if players actually stop paying for the bullshit of "pride and accomplishment" and the instant gratification feedback loop and start paying only what they really enjoy playing, guess what would become a good business model? Developing a fucking good game.

I've found that it's less about what she picks, and more about what you pick. Let her pick any class. Even warrior if that's what speaks to her. Then YOU pick a class that supports her choice. It will make her feel empowered and important. It will add a whole new level of "draw" to the game. So instead of her feeling like she is holding you back, or isn't any good because she doesn't know a lot, she will feel like she is making an impact. And that helps newbies from quiting, and keeps them invested.
---
Hah! I remember Linken. I never got a chance to do Onyxia, looking forward to that.
---
I'm out of the loop on this one. Never played Shaman. What's with the "oh wait..."?
---
Not for myself personally as I don't think I'll get it while levelling but the whirlwind axe quest for warriors, I'm going to help so many people get it once I'm 60 and giving the other warriors such a boost always makes me feel good
---
Yeah but if you can only trade loot to the master looter then he can‚Äôt trade it away.
---
I'm thinking of helping the druids out with some of their quests, though I'll be rolling priest this time around.
---
I have a source that says otherwise who's used this as a levelling build up to level 46 on 1 private server, level 30 on another, and level 25 on a third over the past 4 years.  Just Google "Arcane Priest" (I can't link it here). Which server did you do your testing?
---
I definitely remember holding onto those rogue boots only because +stealth on decent items seemed so rare.
---
This changes the game a lot. Have they confirmed this anywhere? 
---
Dude grow the fuck up if you want to think out a loot system dont be a communist like that people are not infallable gods
---
I would, but I have read many writings on the technique and am confident in that. I'd rather not get myself into that whole "copyright infringement and contract breaking" thing, much less would I publicize it on YouTube.
---
Warrior, Priest core.
---
Druid, shaman, and mage/warlock.
---
That gives you 3 healers, an off tank, a main tank, and 2 solid DPS with only 2 cloth wearers.

Choose Mage or Warlock depending on the time type of CC you want. Warlock with Banish will allow you to solo LBRS, while Polymorph is really good while leveling.

But it's not though.
---
Scenario 1: No loot trading
---
Item drops. Two mage friends need the same item and the guy winning spend 4 days waiting for his ticket to get replied and a GM to transfer the item to the other mage. This ties up the ticket for several days and prevent any other loot trading from occuring.
---
Scenario 2: Loot trading
---
Item drops. Two mage friends need the same item and the guy winning trade it to his friend. The pug gets to the next boss and the same thing happens. The two buddies then go pug a ZG, and does the same to two different items. The two mage friends then go to more 5mans, and keep doing this on every item they need.
---
Which scenario seems more abusable to you?
---
I mean that trades can only occur with the Loot Master.
---
That means the Loot Master can trade with anyone.
---
&gt; talking smack about me for getting a warglaive from Illidan on our first kill
---
Hey guys I found the hunter
---
Haha! That legitimately made me laugh. That meme is going to be alive and well in Classic I can already feel it in me bones.
---
Dwarf paladin for sure. I have always mained melee plate wearing classes (warr + dk) and rolled tank/ dps. I plan on both raiding and pvp while wanting to heal for the first time ever, so paladin fits my needs perfectly. Can always go reck bomb some horde too, if I get a nice 2h . 
---
2 things:
---
1 - if you receive an item from a ML from just a /roll in a pug or whatever, you can still trade it to whoever after that. If you and 5 other bros roll into a pug raid as a group, you essentially have 5 additional rolls on loot since all of you (assuming you're all similar roles, like you're all casters or something) can just /roll on all loot, even if you don't need it, and trade it amongst each other.
---
2 - the current BFA/Legion system doesn't let you roll on certain items if you don't fit the class, like warriors can't roll on leather. In classic, all sorts of classes/specs use things from all armor specializations. Hpals use a lot of cloth, warriors/hunters use leather, etc. 
---
Orc power n1ggaz
---
Truth ^
---
This is a beautiful solution. You entrust your ML to not fuck people over anyways, so it can be traded back to them to redistribute.
---
That way dungeons are free of loot trade abuse, and they still don‚Äôt have to deal with tickets for important raid items being traded off to the wrong person.
---
Please, Blizzard, I know this means you have to re-structure your pre-existing system, but this is so worth it. You have your cake and you can sell to us to eat it too. 
---
Cause then these oldies chasing nostalgia to its core will complain about any little change
---
If the tank, the hunter, the retpala and you as a rogue all roll Need on Cloak of the Black Baron only for whoever wins it to trade it to the druid healer who wanted it for offspec, how do you prove the item was even ninjad?
---
You cant, because all of the above can reasonable use the item. If loot trading wasnt possible, the tank would not need, because the cloak is already in his bank. The hunter would not need, because he's next in line to get the cloak from Ragnaros in his guild and the retpala wouldnt need either, because he only specced Ret to have some fun in 5mans and dont really care about loot.
---
You can post screenshots all you like, but theres no evidence that the item was ever stolen. Meanwhile you had to roll against 3 other people where you otherwise would only roll against one.
---
All the escorts. They're so challenging in vanilla. Don't think of going alone. Especially for the chickens.
---
PvP servers are really fun when theyre fresh - no 60s to gank you. But even at 60, its fun to experience world events like azuregos, etc. It results in all out wars in world PvP.
---
If it‚Äôs not packed then definitely Durotar imo. Especially 1-5
---
I was on a pst server playing from the east coast until cata and it was fine. Server xferred too an est server in cata and didn't really notice any changes. Even on the est server we raided 9-12 est. I've always wanted to raid earlier.
---
Apples and oranges. The two methos achieve the same result, but they are very different processes that incentivize players to behave differently just because of the sheer amount of time it takes to wait for at ticket, meaning you can only do it once every few days rather than ten times each day in different dungeons.
---
Sure, I rustled up a source.

TBC sucks and private TBC servers die in 3 months and so would an official one.
---
1. Aren't pug raids already a risk since usually they are ML anyways?    
---
2. I don't think they would do that, it's too much work. I specifically speaking on dungeons. If you cannot share a needed item, where is the argument against the system in 5mans?
---
I think the joke here is that the two preceding Shaman quests to get the fire an especially water totems are huge pains in the ass. The water one is semi legendary, I think it's like an 8 parter and you have to run all over kingdom come for it. When you get the air totem quest you're either excited or apprehensive about what must be a huge final quest chain, but I think you literally just have to talk to some guy and it's done. 
---
Agree. You just went 11-14 in Westfall and it‚Äôs greatness and then you show up to that boring POS zone
---
Yeah watching a night elf wack a gnome for the whole length of the video was really disappointing. I kept waiting to see the spell, slowly realizing it would never come.
---
No balance changes, ever. PvP is nearly perfectly balanced and any changes would ruin it.
---
TBC and WOTLK are shit and added every single bad mmo killing feature to the MMO genre.
---
&gt;In MoP, this was changed. Once you need rolled on any BoP, it instantly became soulbound to you.
---
What are you saying here? You very much CAN trade loot in the current game. It's just requirement that you already own a similar itemlevel or higher item. Because itemlevel has very little to do with how good an item is in Vanilla, this restriction would never work here, so obviously you would have to be able to trade them.
---
Just think about it. BoE items are by default tradable already, so there's no need to have a loot trading system for them.
---
That leaves BoP items to be the only items that are worth trading, and if the system like you say, wont let you trade them. Why are we even talking about this? Use brain.
---
&gt; Why is everyone freaking out then?
---
&gt; 
---
Because this is not how it'll work in Classic.
---
Sorry, but no, this isn't an apples an oranges situation.
---
These 2 methods allow the exact same result by doing the exact same thing. The only thing different is that one takes slightly longer.
---
Anyone looking to immediately ninja gear to someone is just going to use master looter.
---
How do you exit and reset the instance?
---
Opposite boat. I'm west coast best coast and want to raid 8pm, so I gotta make or find a late night raid guild.
---
üîùto the top üîù
---
Reset the instance with a macro then log out and back in.
---
I don't care about karma. I pointed it out cause it shows the sentiment of some people on this sub. Also I didn't think about using DD for "damage dealer" since it was used alle the time, not only on German servers, but also other languages in the EU region. But I think it useless replying to me things like "IT'S DPS, NOT DD" while knowing what I mean. How is it wrong when you get what I wanna convey?
---
Stop protesting and fighting for \[Insert any social issue\]. Your government representatives already recieved a letter about this last year which they tossed in the trash.
---
Im all for no loot trading but I thought the main concern was for 5man loot. If BoP is unshareable as need then that can defeat a lot of dungeon arguments.   
---
Again I'm all for *loot is final* tho
---
Thanks for the explanation... Also, that sucks :(
---
Oh damn :(
---
&gt;5 man dungeon loot barely matters.
---
I want to hear you say this after you did 70 UBRS runs for Dal'Rends/Truestrike, 30 Strat UD for cloak and 20 BRD for Hand of Justice.
---
That is likely referring to the bug that caused Mana regen without Talenting Priest's Meditation, Mage's Arcane Meditation, or Warlock's Improved Drain Soul. I'm probably forgetting a few other sources (like set bonuses) of the "regenerate mana while casting spells" effect, but I doubt this same bug would be replicated by so many private servers over the past few years, especially considering just how many channeled spells there are in the game. Patch Notes are one of the few ways they keep Blizzlike.
---
debris is good if you're crafting too...gets you early access to mats.  But good luck competing for the spawns.
---
Dude. Preach! I was bitching about this earlier today to my wife who doesn't really give a shit about video games. Glad to see someone else equally heated about the way things have gone in the industry.
---
Druids would be very high on the list.
---
With only 2-3 Druids in a raid you will get tier sets really fast. That leaves you to only have to spend DKP on offpieces like shoulders, boots, empowered legs, rings, rejuv gem etc.
---
Additionally there's a lot of really amazing feral loot in AQ40 that is not good for literally anybody except maybe the occasional rogue who wants some offpieces for PvP, but those rogues will likely prioritize their DKP on the good items like weapons and DFT anyway.
---
&gt;What are you saying here? You very much CAN trade loot in the current game. It's just requirement that you already own a similar itemlevel or higher item. Because itemlevel has very little to do with how good an item is in Vanilla, this restriction would never work here, so obviously you would have to be able to trade them.
---
Newsflash: personal loot didn't exist in Vanilla. This isn't even relevant in the slightest. 
---
Also, before forced the whole game turned into forced personal loot, you could trade gear assuming you won the roll with a Greed roll or were given it from a Master Looter. If you just ninjaed everything with Need rolls and tried to trade all your winnings to friends, you couldn't because Need-rolling would permanently bind it to you.
---
I also addressed the whole BoE and loot trading thing already: 
---
&gt;Sometime in WoD (I think), this was updated to include BoE items - BoEs would bind to you if you needed them, even if you never even equipped them, regardless of item quality.
---
Try to read more than the first sentence before replying next time, please.
---
Your system literally encourages this behaviour.
---
\&gt; Anyone attending the raid stands a chance of receiving an item 
---
\&gt; No out-and-out **guarantee** of items going to the most worthy player 
---
I like the idea of it but in practice this is how I see it going.
---
Firstly I don't think a raid attendance +roll should be only for &gt;80 or &gt;90 roll. Sure this is good, if you roll that high you have a much better chance of winning, and even absolutely winning over trolls with no +roll to score by getting over 100. I think it'd work a lot easier and more fairly if it was just a static modifier. Also gives you better odds against ~~hunters~~ loot whores
---
How it's gonna work though. Let's say you get - +10 raid attendence, +10 Dungeon/Guild Help, +3 for no extra loot. Pretty much you've worked your ass off to help the guild, you deserve priority in loot. You will have +33% chance to your roll, which means you can't lose around 30% of your rolls, and the other 70% you have (i'm not good at math) like what,  66% chance of winning - so around 46% chance of that 70 to win.
---
So with my terrible math, with a sweet +33 to your roll modifier you're at a 75% chance to score that sweet loot.
---
1 in 4 chance of winning - why not /roll when there are no drawbacks.
---
You could implement a loot penalty (you gain like -1 to your roll per loot you get, sure it can decay why not). Or not roll with hunters or have a super carebear guild, where everyone gets along. But people raid to get epics in the end.
---
But at this point, isn't loot council just about the same amount of work and can be just as transparent?
---
Well memed and sadly its true. 
---
I believe they've made some comments about not wanting to implement such changes. I foresee far more "inflation" in classic than there was in original vanilla due to the fact that these farms are so we'll known now. I'm planning on playing a warrior and a mage. I'll probably be leveling the mage first to try and get a "head start" as I plan on leveling quickly. Hording as many mats as I can until I can unload them a bit later.
---
No, but they will be in Classic now that people know about them.
---
&gt;implying only the original vanilla community will be the one playing classic
---
nice try 
---
Fear Ward? I didn't even notice that. At least that spell is still in-game. During the production of the video, I scoured the Internet. Unfortunately, the only Starshards footage I could find was from Burning Crusade, after it was changed from being a 6-second channel to an instant cast DoT with cooldown. I can't show that to prove the point (and the BC animation is pretty lame), and I don't like using other people's videos for footage to start with.
---
This sounds like EPGP but less thought out.  
---
EPGP literally works like this except you dont even have to roll unless 2 people have the  exact same priority on getting loot.  
---
There are also addons to help with keeping track of players and their values. Makes the looting process alot faster when everyone can see priority-standings.  
---
Barely even need to modify it... and if needed officers can give extra EP for those who put more effort into the raids... such as farming consumables and such.  
---
Its all integrated in the EPGP addons themselves too.... on retail...  will just have to see if they  are available on classic.
---
Look up EPGP, ive never been an officer but  ive been in a guild who used that system for years and it works like a charm.  
---
It does punish hoarders with weekly decay aswell.  
---
There are always people who save up to get a better item but its not going to be a problem when theres always other people who need smaller upgrades.   
---
Especially in a 40 man raid... i highly doubt items will go to waste in such an environment.  
---
Offspec items will not affect the system, so if noone wants an item and someone gets it for offspec... good for them. Once again can use modified rules if someone raids with  2 specs to complement on certain bosses.  
---
I suggest you roll on a current server and join a semi-hardcore raiding guild. All the online research won't be enough preparation and some of your approach is clearly informed by false, or only partially true, or faction specific, information (some probably from this subreddit). Plus you'll need a somewhat experienced officer team from the start if you don't want to base your success on pure random chance of the right people joining the guild and you promoting the right people.
---
One of the best ways to not miss is to fight mobs 1 or 2 levels below you. Yes this is less EXP per mob but less time missing means more damage. More damage means less time healing up.
---
Back in the day, the first guides for Molten Core were "leaked". They weren't released. Why? Because the prevailing belief was rooted in the Everquest mentality where releasing a guide so that normal people could clear content would make the game actively worse.
---
How far have we gotten since 2004? I dunno. Why don't I ask my perfectly optimized program which simulates encounters much more complex than that in WoW and tells me the best way to gear out for it?
---
It says "you have a job now, and even back then you wanted everyone to be able to pull their own weight anyway."
---
(And lets not blame our Everquest brothers, they didn't have instances, the boss fights were very simple and the idea of letting little Timmy get some of that sweet Plane of Fear loot was taboo).
---
&gt;Master Looter parties
---
Key word: parties. It would be a disaster if it was enabled in raids.
---
DON'T SELL THE FLASK OF OIL!
---
You guys are looking for a solution for a problem that has never existed. Loot trading is in no form needed in classic. 
---
I'm planning on basically not running any pug dungeons while leveling if loot trading exists... Loot trading will make grouping guild or bust for me.
---
My pro naming tip is to have like 5 backup names already picked, don't be a goober and name your dude Caiuss because Caius was already picked.
---
Who actually cares if it reaches 200k or 20 million, just give me a normal sized realm without any fuss
---
This, but without the weeb shit.
---
Do we want loot trading? NAY!
---
Do we want sharding? NAY!
---
Do we want right click report? NAY!
---
Someone tell me what‚Äôs bad about right click report in under 7 words please.
---
Or if you equip it, you can't trade it.  People need something, you stop and make them put it on so they can't trade.  
---
I'd rather the #nochanges community worry about something else because we won't win this battle.
---
I had this glitch happen to be once! I played around in IF forever not wanting it to go away!
---
even ninja lootin as a group ur names will get around and people will stop groupin with u
---
"You guys"? I don't want Loot Trading. Blizzard wants it as a solution to get rid of mis-assigned item tickets to GMs.
---
I am giving here a counter-solution. One in which both us and Blizzard are perfectly happy.
---
It was pretty great to "accidentally" roll on a RP realm since irl friends were there. I would suddenly come across an event every so often. Lots were advertised through the server forums or in tradechat, but sometimes you'd just be leveling and suddenly there'd be some procession and you'd linger to figure out what was happening.
---
I fondly remember attending some lore event in the Blasted Lands, where some Lore Professor of Azerothian History presided over a "class" of 20-30 people. He had us visit various regions in the zone and explain them in context, and then perched us up on a hill and gave a lecture as we overlooked the portal, followed by a close inspection of the portal itself. Talked all about things that unless you read the lore books or had played Warcraft 1-3 might not entirely be aware of. There were players of all levels, even some without mounts who we had to protect from the higher level mobs as we strolled around, seeing the zone with new eyes. It was real cozy, and super charming.
---
There were little events like that happening every so often, and were great to add a little atmosphere and immersion.
---
Which is the case regardless of whether you use ML or loot trading.
---
Loot trading isn't the issue, the fact that people suddenly seem to think the community will be toxic and full of ninjas is.
---
Loot trading while master loot is enabled would handle loot-related tickets on its own, since you're already putting your faith in someone to handle it appropriately. Otherwise, nah.
---
Might not be able to do this in classic so you‚Äôll have to get naked and die
---
In these kinds of games, to accomplish their goals, most people will follow the path of least resistance. If an MMO is able to be solo played like modern WoW, then a majority of people will be less social with their fellow players because the game doesn't force them to, in order to reach their goals.
---
It's not that I want to stubbornly make everyone only play *my way, the only real way!* It's that in these kinds of games, the community and the behaviors of the people are determined by the rules of the system. What the game allows, doesn't, or encourages. So if I want to have a more social MMO, of course I'm going to be against design decisions that cause the community to trend away from meaningful social interaction.
---
I don't demand that every game cater to this desire. A majority of MMOs these days have the more modern "singleplayer or multiplayer" kind of design you were talking about. I don't want these games to change to suit me, I just want there to exist a few games that can cater to my niche.
---
See man, this is what I miss about gaming.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think you're Alliance scum and I look forward to mopping the floor with you, spreading your limbs to the four corners of Azeroth, and mounting your head on a spike as a warning to all who oppose the Horde.
---
...But god damnit do I respect you for wanting to inject a bit of the thrill of the hunt into the game. 
---

For reals, I was a Diablo 2 player before I played WoW. In Diablo 2, especially in those days, it was a cut-throat dog-eat-dog world where if you were in any open game, you had a risk of some asshole joining your game and murdering you (well, there's a couple steps involved sometimes with TPs and WPs, but you get the point). And that made it AWESOME! So then I started playing WoW, and first I was like what the hell is this!? I can't kill these people!? Until I was out of the starting zones, of course. Then I picked every fight I could. Which was stupid maybe, but it was fun. Even when I lost the fight, which was most times. 
---
Like sure, it sucks at first getting ganked, but maybe sometimes you actually end up in a fair fight, and you both have fun, and when you're high level you can come back and make people's lives miserable, get them to HATE the other faction, and then THEY'LL start engaging in world PvP as well. Next thing you know, both factions have this intense rivalry and a few people on each side of the server have some reputations for being dicks, or heroes, and the game is filled with personality. At the end of the day, ganking eventually produces a net positive when you take into account the ripple effect associated with it. That's how I see it anyways. 
---
Not something I remember, but something I recently discovered when I stumbled upon a YouTube channel called Chimly, who analyses Vanilla WoW music in his series (ScoreCraft): the only melody that you can hear in the Duskwood soundtrack is a corrupted tune from the Elwynn Forest soundtrack, indicating that it used to be part of the Forest but got corrupted and only the memory remained. I was blown away. Really awesome detail.
---
Basically, I‚Äôll be going full turbo nerd. However, this realise on Blizzard announcing a firm release date as I need to submit for leave! Haha
---
I want to do the Tirion questline in EPL again. I still remember the first time I saw the family picture and it's a good memory for me. 
---
First night probably from release till I can‚Äôt function. Then probably 16 hour days for the next 2 days to get ahead of the pack. Then who knows. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna take off for 3 days
---
A yes... as with my love Rolling Ignites and allowing Execute to work with Sweeping Strikes again
---
Horde because shamans
---
Or you pick a streamer free server and a brand new streamer gets popular...
---
Yeah but taking a few moments to run up and smack it every 35 sec isnt too hard
---
Been on a few MC pugs with Pertento.  Knasbob is a great raid leader.  Always excited to get in on one of their raids, good dudes.  
---
You'll find this sub is full of hypocrites sadly... oh well. Nice meme though. I've been saying this for the last few months.
---
It's not really that hard to get into a group as mage. Finding a guild is easy, same with 5 man dungeons. A bit harder maybe for raids, but even then, the "you won't get accepted" trope is overblown. In reality, as long as you're not a dps-specced druid or paladin or priest you'll be able to find groups and raids without much difficulty. Although yes, it's generally easiest to find groups and raids as a healer. 
---
The goodness of the community was in large part due to the game's design, changing the game's design in a toxic direction will change the community that direction too. Diablo 2 had the most cut throat community I've ever seen in gaming, and look at the loot system, a zero sum free for all.
---
You don‚Äôt think this will be obselete given the significant changes to the macro system that Blizz has already mentioned?
---
&gt;I appreciate a lot of people are for no changes, and I get it, completely. The issue arrises from the fact that it is pretty certain that Classic Lauch will be much bigger than originally, and instead of picking up subscribers, it will likely maintain/drop off over time.
---
When they released new servers after the original 11 in vanilla it was pretty damn packed to be honest. And from what I heard at the time, those original 11 were pretty damn crazy as well.
---
Also, won't they still have queues to enter the game? 
---
People are afraid that automated mutes/bans/suspension will be abused.
---
Sorry, eleven words.
---
Since it will be running on a newer client, I'm sure someone will make an addon for this.
---
For what it's worth, I don't think that guy's very representative of this community, especially when you consider that he's now at a very negative vote count.
---
For me when I think playing vanilla again I always imagine hitting enter world on that freshly made character, the narrator starts talking as the camera slowly zooms in to your starting zone, and then you see it. You see the dozens of other people standing right where you are watching the same cut scene. Knowing that all these people next to you are probably just as giddy as you are to relive these starting zones that we all love. For me it would have to be feeding off the enthusiasm of all these people around me. It's gonna be great.
---
Yes he is implying a future classic server, because they already stated they are going to use the same server infrastructure. I feel like you are not even knowing what you are disagreeing about, and just trying to insight some argument while we are already on the same page. 
---
That is in no way classic.
---
It depends if you're okay with the fact that you'll get ganked a lot. My gametime is limited so I don't have time to deal with gankers all the time. 
---
Fucking ventrilo man.  Back when I was 12 and had no money.  
---
Had to rely on the older guys in the guild to pay for our guilds server.  And speaking of‚Äîthose guys are in their 40s and 50s now...Jesus.
---
Crown of Will, I think it was called.  Elite ogre quest line from Tarren Mill.
---
Thats a good point, but it doesn't even need to be made. There will always be assholes who use the mechanisms at their disposal to screw other people over if given the chance.
---
The idea that its hypocritical to be against loot trading while also a fan of the community is asinine af.
---
The point is introducing risk where it otherwise would not exist.  There are plenty situations where one would be 100% to get the item and not Need their other party members to help reduce the odds of the other party, who does not actually need it, getting it.  
---
Warlocks have life tap and should be healed when they use it, so sacrificing felhunter will never be worth it.
---
Scenario three: just run the fucking dungeon again.
---
You guys are over-complicating this.
---
Are you talking about getting the 2% mana regen every 4s, instead of 15% shadow damage?
---
Short answer is no that will never be better. Even on the longest fights you have pots/runes/life tap. I can‚Äôt imagine the mana would ever be that useful.
---
Since it seems like you‚Äôre looking for lock raiding info. I‚Äôd also mention that unless the ONLY thing you‚Äôre doing on a warlock is logging in to cast shadow bolts at a raid boss in DS/Ruin spec, you should consider SM/Ruin spec. Imo the other talents (and keeping your pet!) make up for the tiny 5% difference. Because outside of shadow bolting a boss the other talents make a big difference.
---
You are disproving your own point. If you can't prove that it was ninja'd, then you might as well not even consider it ninja'd. Even without loot trading, there's nothing stopping that warrior from rolling need either to disenchant it or vendor it. In that scenario, you wouldn't be able to prove that the item was ninja'd, yet it was. So what's different here?
---
If someone wins an item they obviously cannot use, then you have proof they are a ninja, and you can take a screen shot and contribute to their reputation as a ninja.
---
If someone wins an item they could potentially use (even if they end up not using it), then no, you can't prove they are a ninja. But does that really matter? A person who could potentially use the item rolled need on it and won it over you. The existence of loot trading is irrelevant here, because that same thing could happen without loot trading existing.
---
Why are you guys anticipating playing with people who cheat you?
---
promega says 'Imma just roll on everything"
---
ars says "you're really going to do that to your fellow guild members"
---
And you tell ars to grow up?
---
Haha that would be me. I paid for vent, can confirm I am 46 lol
---
I've always wondered if this wasn't really an issue and is just an issue propagated by streamers since people could possibly troll streamers with this. I'm not saying that is right, but I'm not really convinced this will be a big issue for the average player, but streamers could DEFINITELY be impacted by it and they have a large vocal platform to project their viewpoints. 
---
Gyrochromatic micro adjuster
---
Seriously. People arguing that loot trading wasn't in vanilla might as well argue that anyone with a good internet connection should be banned. I mean, people didn't have Google Fiber in vanilla, so they shouldn't have it now. /s
---
Like you said, GM tickets were the archaic way of accomplishing loot trading. But technology and Blizzard's code have gotten better, and now it's a reasonable option to automate it. It accomplishes the same goal, but in a more streamlined manner.
---
Yeah I run there early to get increased first aid. It's just an ugly blur of dodging gators and spiders.
---
The first part of this comment but unsarcastically. No changes whatsoever 
---
&gt;  "pay up or start over".
---
It's $20.
---
The game costs $15/month.
---
Same
---
While I agree loot trading shouldn't be in classic doesn't need rolling on something cancel out the loot trading option or am I remembering incorrectly how it worked on retail i'm not sure
---
We complain about changes that seem little but are actually huge when you look closely, like loot trading. That's a really smart suggestion, makes a lot of sense.
---
I know this subreddit loves shitting on retail for no reason, but in any serious content I do there's always people willing to talk. The community really hasn't degraded that much, at least not in the "not garbage" scene. I hate to say this, but if you think otherwise it's probably because you don't do any content that people actually care about. 
---
&gt; There will always be a percentage of assholes who use the mechanisms at their disposal to screw other people over if given the chance.
---
And, the mechanisms to screw people over on loot exist regardless of whether loot trading is in the game, since masterlooter is a more effective means of being a ninja.
---
Thanks for admitting loot trading is a non-issue!
---
I‚Äôd be pronouncing it Och-in-doon, being Scottish this would be the correct pronunciation.
---
&gt; If the tank, the hunter, the retpala and you as a rogue all roll Need on Cloak of the Black Baron only
---
I read somewhere else that needing a BOP item prevents you from trading it. 
---
&gt;  Meanwhile you had to roll against 3 other people where you without loot trading would have gotten the item by default.
---
So what we're talking about is a reduced chance to get the loot. By your own admission, there will be no evidence that the item was unfairly looted. So when you don't win it, you will always have Loot Trading to blame, even if the person who rolled and won it legitimately kept it for themselves. Doesn't matter... you didn't get it so clearly the group conspire to keep it from you.
---
If I felt that that was a real problem, I would run Strat with people I trusted.
---
I've watched a couple of videos on shaman levelling. Is it worth playing enhancement until lvl 40 and then reset my talents into ele? I am also concerned on the gear switching as i feel the lack of intellect and spell damage will be noticed.  What suggestions do we have? 
---
Ooh!
---
Because some people have discovered they can get karma by fearmongering, and other people believe anything they see which is upvoted.
---
Some people will, but the vast majority won't.
---
It did. It had the...
---
Panda
---
Ragnaros
---
And
---
Zergling pet?
---
&gt; "Carrot on a stick", which quite a number of people had just sold off when they got it
---
What kind of monsters did you play with?
---
This video was frustrating. It started reasonable, but then spent about fifteen minutes talking only about people who view games, not people who play them. If you asked those 54 million viewers whether they'd consider paying 15 bucks a month to play wow, THAT would be interesting to me.
