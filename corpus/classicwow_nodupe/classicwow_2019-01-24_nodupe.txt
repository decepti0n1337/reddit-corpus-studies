Nice cop out. You’re truly convincing me that you aren’t a petulant child. 
---
---
---
Go paladin so you can bubble his pet and get him attacked anytime you want. Priorities!!
---

---
Seriously though, Paladin/NE hunter is a fun PvP combo because you can trick small groups into attacking you, not knowing there's a stealthed hunter nearby. With good set up and execution taking down groups of 2 or 3 should come easy, and groups of 4 should even be possible occasionally. Between traps, bubble, blessing of freedom, the pet and healing there's a lot you can do in a fight.
---
You are hating something you know nothing about, judging it only by appearance and by characteristic which is entirely wrong.  
---
Knowing more about something makes it less interesting?  
---
Now that's only what a true dumbass would say.  
---
&gt; And just numbers is boring. A talent that gives 5% crit is incredibly powerful, and a total snore to unlock.
---
But arbitrary things make the game fun. Seriously, it's a little carrot and stick that can really hook the player.
---
To say that nobody enjoys retail is the reason why blizzard needs to stop listening to the players. Not everyone thinks or feels the same way, a LOT of people still enjoy playing the game in its current state. The reason why the game is where it is is that Blizzard is listening to the wrong players, the same group of people that spammed Cata forums requesting streamlined talents, TBC forums for LFG and so on. Too many people are vastly overestimating classic launch. 
---
Not really. If a server is over populated by one faction, the other enjoys instant queues. This actually serves as an incentive to roll a the lower population side, since you get instant battlegrounds at least. Cross realm didn't remove the problem, it just turned it into a per-battle group issue. If your group was 55% horde, you still saw queues as horde. But the worst case situation was a battle group that favors one faction with a server favoring the other faction.
---
For example, your battle group is 66% alliance but you rolled on a server that is 70% horde. You get the bonus of dominating the world pvp pretty easily because alliance are so few, and also get instant speed battlegrounds. Sounds good right? Sure, but now there is absolutely no incentive to roll as alliance at all, and over time your server becomes completely one sided and if you actually wanted some balanced world pvp you won't ever see it.
---
Go be wrong somewhere else please!
---
That is a separate issue for me. But I completely understand that aspect. They made it much more spec focused than class focused and as a result they had to remove a lot of gear customization. 
---
Queues are caused by faction imbalance. An entire battle group is not going to be balanced, there will still be long queues. An unbalanced server can self correct, because pvpers will want to roll on the side with instant queue times, but with cross realm matching that goes out the window.
---
That I can kind of get behind, it's why I don't like the art direction Hearthstone is taking, comparing to the epic scale of the art in Gwent for example. Still, retail WoW is not at that "disney" stage in my eyes yet, unlike Hearthstone. 
---
There isn't a single classic pserver that was 100% blizzlike. Never has been and there never will be.
---
There will be people that take time off from work to play.  
---
There will be people that skip school to play.  
---
There will be people that break up with their girlfriends to play.  
---
There will be people that quit their jobs to play.  
---
There will be people that drop out of school to play.  
---
There will be people that will get divorced to play because their significant others aren't okay with them spending an exorbitant amount of time playing vidyas. This one might be extreme, but it'll happen.  
---
There will also be people that literally die during gaming marathons due to malnutrition and lack of sleep.
---
Chances are you won't know anyone doing the extremes as they will be outliers, but they'll still be there.
---
The problem is that the servers became one sided anyways. Cross realms were added later than anything else in Vanilla. Server mergers already happened, server transfers were already available. It didn’t fix the problem and it won’t this time around.
---
You can say you have incentive but you had it then and it didn’t change. Servers didn’t balance out they became more lopsided because people would either a) roll to a different server, or b) roll to the side that had the population.
---
&lt;The End&gt; Spirestone server (may have been Skullcrusher back then, we got a free xfer at some point)
---
&gt; What a weird way to spend my leisure time, right? 
---
What do you take us for, normies?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No specific agro seal.
---
This is what I’m worried about! OCE here and really want to reroll on my original server with one of my old friends for all the nostalgia etc...
---
However I recently moved my main off an Oceanic server on live to make everything easier because my current group of friends are all American/Canadian...these are the guys I play with the most.
---
Decisions...
---
If only saying I'm wrong could somehow refute everything I've said. That sucks, doesn't it?
---
You are assuming level 60 is the goal of vanilla, like I said its about the journey not the destination... 
---
Ah yes, back when you only had 2 free talent points to spare outside of the meta build and would get kicked from groups for "you get\[ting\] to decide".  
---
I'd still rather have it than the current system at least. 
---
&gt; If you played you will remember how diverse peoples specs often were because rather then being a purely specialized for one thing at a time build they had to go Hybrid builds to be able to PVP and, raid with out respeccing.
---
This was a glitch in player behavior due to the fact that Vanilla came out in 2004, before fifteen years of data-mining and theorycrafting.
---
The meta now is to respec to your PvE and PvP cookie-cutter builds because to run a suboptimal build is to ask other players to carry you for your own capriciousness.
---
If what you said above is your expectation of how Classic is going to be then I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...
---
No server self corrected in vanillas life.
---
Also I’m almost positive blizzard originally grouped battle groups by population so they had more balances than the lopsided servers.
---
Thunderstorm was 3.0, so Wrath prepatch.  2.4.3 was the last BC patch.
---
Yes. You spam Frostbolt.
---
Okay lets go through this one by one:
---
&gt; I have made lots of specs designed to do specialized tasks with the old talent system.
---
Okay, but unless you were inexplicably wealthy you weren't able to actually adapt day-to-day. Respec costs make it so that your builds are set in stone unless you want to wait a month for the 50g cost to reset.
---
Respecing is cost-prohibitive and hampers the entire premise that experimentation is someone anyone can just do on a whim.
---
&gt; that feeling is one that will cause him to toy with the tree even more.
---
This is the silliest part of the argument to me. He's theorycrafting on paper in his own time. I see nothing about testing builds on a pserver, or analyzing logs, or any of that. 
---
OP is describing **feelycrafting**. Until he opens a guide that explains the mechanics behind each talent and their synergies, all they're doing is akin to mindless reading the back of the game box on the way home from the store.
---
Furthermore, I'm just not impressed when someone puts two and two together and sees that Wand-spec Priest is the ideal way to level. I mean, it's literally the first row of talents. Is that really worth feeling excited about?
---
Fuck man, I've been on private servers for the past three months attempting to actually fill in holes in the most popular Vanilla Paladin guides online and [putting together a specialized non-Reck, Holy-Ret build](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aitmwl/holy_paladin_leveling_spec/eeqgop8/) for leveling that I can back up with numbers and stats.
---
My general takeaway from all this? The talent trees are inherently flawed.
---
There is a very cool series called *The Underdogs of Raiding*, by the YouTuber Hamsterwheel. [Link to first episode here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RevirDl5oAU)
---
The coolest thing is that he shows you what talent trees looked like at launch v.s. what they looked like in patch 1.12 and gives you the optimal builds for each. The thing that immediately jumps out at you is that in 1.1, the most powerful builds for each spec involved dipping hard into the other talent trees!
---
*Visually* this brought warmth to my heart. But something huge happened to all specs on the way to 1.12. The best builds start looking like Artifact Weapon trees.
---
Why? 
---
Because the more you dip into other trees, the more points you waste. As wonderful as trees looked at launch, this is the main reason many “hybrid” builds failed. You're sacrificing your most powerful traits for ones that the other specs *naturally* grew into.
---
&gt; Getting into more complex builds for more specialized tasks.
---
This is a meme. Come on dude, there's only so much you can actually push and pull because once you're down one tree it becomes mathematically more difficult to go down other trees. The saddest part about Vanilla is that hybrid specs, who you would think have the most versatility, are actually the least powerful when spreading themselves too thin, making them very ineffective at complex, specialized playstyles, such as AoE-grinding, or WPvP.
---
&gt; Meanwhile my friend who isn't half as good as me but, at the time liked to "play" with unique stuff. Finished his Arena season over 2400. How? The ass hole stumbled on to some homebrew double shockadin build
---
Just Googling this real quick, not six months after TBC launched Engadget has a PvP guide on how to slay with Shockadin builds. I'm not saying you're lying but my impression was always that Shockadin was a very well-known thing as soon as TBC came around. I'm very skeptical that your friend just randomly stumbled across a Shockadin build at around the same time everyone knew that Shockadins were the new Paladin PvP meta.
---
[removed]
---
They can do the Old School Runescape route and have polls to see what is and isn't added in future patches, that would work nicely. 
---
I played on Moon Guard. You could smell that place through the internet. 
---
&gt;  I don't think many people would complain if they gave the Paladins a hard taunt. 
---
Bro you must not be reading this sub too often lol
---
Pretty sure Wikipedia didn't even exist back in Vanilla, unless you're still using the example from Wrath.
---
Not true. I and friends purposely rolled on servers with instant queue for pvp purposes. Nobody sits in three hour queues for months in a row. The population doesn't equalize, but it does correct to a degree.
---
Perhaps with more time the population could have corrected fully, but battle groups were implemented before that could happen and in many cases the servers started getting even worse after that.
---
Their totems would be bigger than they are!
---
I think what you are not accounting for is the cost prohibitive nature of respeccing. If you think you are simply going to mosy around classic wow with what ever the most 100% optomised spec for what your doing is. One of two things is true. Either you are delusional. Or you never plan on doing anything outside of wow. Every respec is gonna cost you 50g. In an expac where you are gold starved all the time. That 50g a pop is gonna end you.
---
So many of the best specs in classic aren't about being 100% optimized. Instead they are about sacrificing stuff you don't absolutely need for one task. So you can pick up some other stuff for another task. Your assessment that classic wow is "solved" is just not correct.
---
Yeah I have been hoping for a system like this since classic was announced. 
---
I'm not assuming. This is built into the game. Every game mechanic either pushes you to level 60 or throws barriers in front of you that force you to level in order to accomplish something. 
---
Can't even level fishing without leveling your character, lol.
---
Or maybe you just want to use WoW as a glorified chat room and stand in the town square all day?
---
Homage to the MMOs that came before WoW. I wonder how many people at Blizzard played UO?
---
Yeah it's still pretty good in PvP for shadow spec priests. The dps catches up when fully invested in the tree and in shadow form, and the healing from vampiric embrace is great too.
---
Never, ever believe that Reddit is indicative of a gaming community as a whole. 
---
...Seriously? The memes are true?
---
Until AQ40, when you switch to fireball ignite squad of doom.
---
Don't forget fire blast when the mob is about to die and there's not enough time for another frostbolt to hit. Gotta top those damage meters.
---
You are wrong, sorry. Nobody who enjoyed pvp stayed on a server with 4 hour queues.
---
I mean, if you want to show some evidence of your claims that would be one thing but I know from my experience that queues were better before the battle groups, because I played as the underdog faction. Battle groups only made the situation worse.
---
Yes. The memes are true. There isn't a rotation. And sometimes when your Frostbolt crits you may literally have to stand there and forget casting all together because you will pull aggro
---
Like others have said it's not super important to go resto. for instance this is what I'm doing leveling with a warrior: 
---
   
---
Up to lvl 50(aoe fire totem grind/melee build) https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuLbhoZxibzV
---
  
---
At 51: ele fury and nature's swiftness: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuVr0oZZxfczoxo
---
Agreed
---
To be fair all Paladin types were fine until endgame, and endgame was not the entire game back in Vanilla. Leveling was a big chunk of the experience. I raided pretty hardcore for several months, in one of the top guilds of my server back in the day, and yet the time it took me to leisurely level up to 60 on my Paladin (10ish days?) was roughly equal to how much I spent raiding afterwards. If we also add PvP to the mix, which most people did in Vanilla, and Ret (and even prot) was definitely viable there, there were definitely more ways to play the class. High end raiding was the only issue.
---
Lol nice shot. Did you set that up with the quote like, or was it an organically taken screenshot?
---
because of this your rotation will include "shoot wand" when threat is high :P
---
It’s actually 1 rage every three seconds regardless of combat
---
But still not necessary as arms. Fury I don’t know shit about 
---
It's candid haha
---
The current talents on live are not terrible, they are definitely the best iteration of this new system so far (for what that's worth), however they have a critical flaw that Blizzard underestimated heavily and has reduced the influx of new players to the game.
---
The fact that you don't get a reward for levelling up. Back in Vanilla, each level up you could get that talent point, and you would immediately see a small difference on your character. Nowadays the talents are either flavour or situational. You need to have the bad choices, even if the player never picks them. It makes them feel smart and unique. And of course picking a talent every FIFTEEN levels or whatever it is now is not a good carrot on a stick.
---
This...
---
This is *exactly* my argument spit back at me. Except your conclusion is wrong. I can prove to you it's wrong because I'm telling you what the meta on current Vanilla servers is. Nobody wastes time with clunky, suboptimal “hybrid” builds.
---
The high respec costs force people to either go full PvE or full PvP and then either have their guild pay for respec costs or gold farm.
---
That's where we've ended up after fifteen years of playing. The reason we ended up here is because everyone quickly realized that gimping your performance is the worst solution to high respec costs.
---
You can't be both a Mary Sue _and_ an inconsequential side character whose only purpose is to be a love interest to more powerful/influential characters.  They're mutually exclusive concepts.
---
The new writing is silly, arbitrary, and not in line with her established character at all.  In fact, it's antithetical to everything that she represented in WC3.
---
You would make a very good modern Blizzard dev. They agree with every opinion you have. They also make a game that sucks and, no one wants to play so congratulations. As far as you saying me and, him are playing feelscraft. Well you just sound dumb if you aren't feeling anything playing you should play another game. Civ sounds more you speed.
---
The paladin thing at the end. You are talking about S1. I am talking about s3 with full resil in play. Also the build of Shockadin I am talking about was abnormal at the time for many reasons. At that point in the expac the double shockadin thing I am talking about was a well guarded secret that some people did know about. My friend "stumbled" on it.
---
Don't listen to the noobs here. Of course you don't just spam frostbolt... every 3 minutes you also cast Arcane Power.
---
Nsfw
---
Also there is actual content to re-experience while leveling up, especially dungeons. I will probably play it with some of my friends who started at release with me as well and we all didn't touch the game since The Burning Crusade. We're about 4-5 people and our plan is to heavily focus on dungeons. This is definitely not the fastest way to level up but I think it might be the most fun way.
---
Horde is stronger in unorganized PvP maybe but once we talking premades nothing beats HPallys
---
Well, even if paladins had no problem *holding* aggro, they wouldn't be able to taunt off a main-tank during a fight such as Drakkisath in UBRS :S
---
Private server values aren't the same as Classic WOW.  No one knows for sure how difficult the raid will be.
---
I might roll a mage instead of a rogue this time...
---
Yeah, there were some that were more interesting, like the Tempest Keep dungeons, Durnholde Keep, Slave Pens/Steamvaults, those were all at least a little bit winding and non-linear or hallway to some degree.
---
I think BC could benefit from a BRD level dungeon or two, and I would absolutely not complain if they added dungeons. I get the point of keeping the purity of Classic, but I think BC, still being the better more fleshed our version of WoW, has room for improvements in some small ways. 
---
&gt; Nah dude we all used cookie cutter builds. Don’t lie.
---
Maybe _you_ chose to not play a huge facet of the game, but don't assume that everyone else did.
---
Isnt battle shout better than demo shout for aoe threat?
---
One of my favorite things about vanilla is how much time you can spend on preparation and theorycrafting.  As our customization options dwindled so did my prep pasttime.  The elimination of the talent tree was the nail in the coffin.  But was all in the name of easy balance management to facilitate "hookers and blow" for the devs as stated elsewhere in this thread and by MaximumEffort433.
---
"That's where we've ended up after fifteen years of playing. The reason we ended up here is because everyone quickly realized that gimping your performance is the worst solution to high respec costs."
---
I am not sure what kind of player you are but, if your plan is to constantly respec to always be "optimal" for the specific task. Well thats just too much wow. Having played on private servers. Suboptimal specs balancing your ability to pvp and raid. Or Pvp and, farm are the norm not the exception. I am not really sure what you are talking about.
---
depends on the fight. in a single target boss fight you will just use frostbolt, basically. it's also important to time your arcane power well in coordination with your one use trinket of choice and get most mileage out of PoM (most mages are the AP/frost build). Winter's Chill mages don't have any CDs. With modern DPS you will play differently on multiple target fights, such as in MC on Lucifron, Gehennas, Sulfuron, Majordomo. There you will use flamestrike, CoC, AE and sapper, as well as being ready to lip in case you pull aggro somehow.   
---
Even if frost mage isn't the most difficult or nuanced raiding spec you can still tell who's better just by looking at total number of casts, optimal CDs and consumable usage.
---
It's definitely Illumination. That talent alone makes Paladin the best Vanilla healer and they can virtually never run out of Mana with proper itemization and downranking, while at the same time churning out meter-topping HPS. It is also relevant in the entirety of content, is very low on the tree, so literally any spec can pick it up and it basically can heal without issues, etc. 
---
Then we're talking past each other because it seems like your definition of a spec that “balances” your ability to both raid *and* PvP is a spec that is actually just a PvE build with maybe one or two CC or survivability talents switched around, or a PvP build that has just enough points in PvE talents to not get you kicked from a raid.
---
I would never call either of those situations “balanced” but if that's what you're calling them then we're just arguing semantics.
---
Dark runes skitter across the surface
---
Just take a look at Jaina and Elsa from "Frozen".  
---
https://i.imgur.com/TIH50ma.jpg  
---
You might understand my point ;)
---
If you think arenas are bad just wait till you try solo queueing the only instanced pvp vanilla has to offer.
---
Didnt care for dailies. Flying mounts were kinda lame but people still duked it out in front if dungeons or at elemental plateau. Just like how most of the wpvp you see is in front of strat or brm. Heroics were challenging and worthwhile, but got as stale as vanilla dungeons did after grinding prebis for awhile. Dungeon finder was meh. Spamming in world was still prevalent on felmyst at least- and it didnt just port you into the dungeon at the time or anything.
---
Vanilla was kind of a turd tbh but at least the gameplay was rewarding, fun, and most things had flavor and character (as opposed to retail gruel).
---
&gt; YOU get to decide what kind of Paladin you want to be.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You could be a healadin, or... or uh....
---
&gt; ... uhhhhh hmmmmm....
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; ... nevermind.
---
But there is variation. One specs into imp wisdom, one / two spec into lasting judgment and keep judgments on the boss. One specs into Kings and imp concentration. Another specs into Imp might. Another might get Sanctuary.
---
Yes, Paladins are healadins. But there's 5 or 6 necessary varieties of healadins.
---
Yea, that wasn't a thing for 95% of guilds....
---
Well yes..
---
In boring bosses with no mechanics for you to worry about you literally just spam frostbolt and then use arcane power (+ trinket) at the right time.
---
Mostly on trash though you can do all kinds of cool stuff and use a lot of instant abilities and a ton of AOE. Doing "speedrunning" you get the extra problem of mana, as you won't spend time drinking and have to use mana cooldowns efficiently and use a mechanic called drinkwalking, which you drink right before mana tricks.
---
Come AQ you go fire, which spices things up a bit more, you have to stack scorch, you should use fireblast inbetween casts, and there's a constant worry about ignite, which is a stacking debuff where 1 mage gets crazy damage... and thus threat, all the mages has to act accordingly to this.
---
Overall mage is pretty boring to raid with in terms of "rotation" but everything outside raids is really damn cool and raiding is just well. 4-12 hours a week compared to your total gametime not so much.
---
&gt; You would make a very good modern Blizzard dev.
---
Unironically a compliment! Thanks!
---
Personally, I don't mind just spamming one spell in raids, I never understood people that want to be fully focused on "intriguing" rotations and the like, as the point of raids is to focus on the raid mechanics and teamwork, for me. Once you learn your rotation, it becomes muscle memory and it is no different from spamming just one spell anyway. I would prefer there to be more situational spells to cast, such as Ice Block to save yourself in some phase, rather than the basic rotation itself being complex.
---
Retail wow is dying though, look a sub numbers on a graph that shows all time subs then tell me otherwise.
---
Love this comment.
---
This is how we did it back during original HWL grind. There was no debuff for leavers so you'd have one person be designated, if it was the premade you knew (there weren't many, and in our case only one was a deterrent because we COULD win, it would just take awhile). If it was them, the person would just /afk and we'd reque after a minute.
---
I can't believe Classic wow is going to be made and released before Star Citizen has. If you told me that 5 years ago I would have laughed at the idea.
---
"If you think arenas are bad just wait till you try solo queueing the only instanced pvp vanilla has to offer." 
---
I know this pain all too well. The ques for BG's at off peak times could be over an hour. This is why I like the idea of "off peak" battle groups. For the two in the morning players. So they can actually pvp.
---
Classic wow had a lot wrong with it. That being said it was still by a mile the best version. If they took the classes from TBC and, just patched them into classic but, kept the rest of the game unadulterated. I would be drooling.
---
Thats my opinion of TBC. They fixed most of the classes but, ruined the game lol. I do hope it gets a server though. Anyone from WOTLK back deserves to have their day. 
---
True of actual classic but when classic servers launch its going to be everyone using cookie cutter specs.
---
Ahaha I love this thread. Thank you OP for posting it. 
---
I love Classic, warts and all, and this just reminds me of how much hate I get on the r/wow subreddit when I constantly argue that pruning and putting everything back on the GCD (as god intended!) were unironically great decisions because I want retail to get back to where Vanilla was.
---
If there's anything I love most about Vanilla it's that it was dead easy mechanically but front-loaded all it's fun in planning, farming, traveling, grinding, and pre-production.
---
90% of winning was just showing up! Like life!
---
Survival Hunter was pretty good in PvP as I remember.
---
At least let it give 5% crit in a single point, not one point at a time for 1% each. It was not a fun or engaging way to level up.
---
Undead (male) have the coolest caster animations by quite a large margin if you ask me. It's why we want the Swirly Ball back as Rogues.
---
This community is so delusional. I love it.
---
21 points in Holy, 30 points in anything else you want.
---
The best part was having a hunter pull Wyrmthalak after The Beast with his pet. 10/10 pathfinding.
---
my rotation in MC on trash/60% of the  bosses : Pom-&gt; fap -&gt; oil of immolation -&gt; arcane power  -&gt;flamestrike -&gt; coc -&gt; arcane explosionx1 (hope for clearcast)  -&gt; sapper  -&gt; snap -&gt; coc -&gt; arcane explosion spam.
---
Only on very few bosses do i actually spam frostbolts (magmadar,baron geddon, golemag and ragnaros)
---
and  even then the rotation is more than just spamming frostbolts, you have  to make decisions on when to evo, what pot to use, positioning for  dispels on certain fights and controlling your regen/buffs/globals etc
---
This is the optimal pve mage spec for mc/ony [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0ycocquZVA0cod](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0ycocquZVA0cod)
---
I rolled a warrior. I spent all my money buying cloth off the auction house to make bandages because I didn't know to buy food from innkeepers. 
---
she used to be a diplomat, not a destroyer
---
Jesus it's not that serious lol
---
I'm guessing you're joking, but since some people actually do this Onyxia...Wand damage does 100% threat per point of damage while frost spells do 70% threat thanks to a talent, so it's not a good idea.
---
I don't like how they introduced it but why do you dislike the selfie cam itself? I don't see the problem 
---
Good players didn't google the best build.

Today... we are all sons of Ragnar Lothbrok!
---
I played on different private servers using both 1.12 and 1.1 itemization. The difference is big. It makes gearing up really boring because you will use those 1.12 pices for the entirety of the game.
---
When playing with progressive itemization you will do some dungeon every patch because there is something new to get. Really sucks with 1.12 because you do the dungeons until you get your stuff then never again. 
---
Ya when the new talent system came around is when I stopped playing for a few years
---
Yep, and it's absolute trash.  Favorite moment leveling up my warlock in vanilla was when I learned rain of fire.  Literally just ran around casting it at random trash mobs because of how awesome it was.  Now?  Oh, you're affliction?  Well, no rain of fire for you!  It takes away from the entire leveling aspect of the class where you would learn all these new abilities, even if you weren't necessarily specialized in them.
---
??? It's not an insane amount of work. Also the item stats for every item from every patch is open source information. Just download it.
---
Lol I cannot wait 
---
Soul link didn't require a void. Worked with any summoned demon.
---
I used the think hunters were garbage because they can't play a tank or healer role. Then I considered the usefulness of simply being level 60 when your friends aren't. 
---
So my main goal is to roll a huntard and get to level 60 asap. farm gold and help my friends with their goals. 
---
Oh. Wow. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Oh joy! One more spell! 
---
That's very helpful, thank you. I think it's more the idea of "just sitting back and spamming frost bolt" that I didn't like. I'll be sure to keep good track of my trinket etc. cooldowns. 
---
If you plan on using Frost to it's most effectiveness for leveling no. Frost bolt is actually hardly used in AoE grinding. In the raid environment however it's almost exclusively used. That, Arcan brilliance, Conjure Water and Food, Conjure Mana Gems, and maybe a Magic Amp/Damp is what you'll be using in MC and BWL.
---
Drinkwalking? I haven't heard that term before. Hmmm...
---
Yeah that's true. I think it was moreso the idea of "just sitting back and spamming xyz," but you're right. All rotations basically become that eventually, and it'll be a nice change from retail at least lol. 
---
I've never played a mage but I've raided up to Twin Emps. Never did I see a mage use an offensive ability that was not Frostbolt of fluctuating rank. You guys also get to cast Remove Curse on top of everything I posted above. Also one of you gets to be the lucky and revered "Portalmaster".
---
As troublesome as it is, the "min-max mindset" does exist for a reason. It's even something that's socially reinforced when you have character individually becoming a tax on performance and contribution in a group setting. That's just the reality of the situation.
---
For a clearer example of how this works, one need only look at Overwatch and how individual hero choice can often be an absurd game of balancing personal desires with group needs in competition with other players on the team which is in competition with the opposing team.
---
Of course, this is not to say that having the choice to pay that tax to express that individuality is a bad thing. It is merely to provide further context and to push back on the idea that min-maxing is wholly unnecessary.
---
Part of me is very very excited for the minimalism of just casting Frost Bolt haha, and I am very very excited for retail Classic for the casual aspect. I feel like, for me personally, as someone who is only able to play for a few hours here and there every week, it's a lot more difficult to progress and see all the content I want to see. 
---
Looks like a group of adventurers. Good shit, man!
---
This is helpful for trash, thank you! I was wondering what those fights would require...
---
Doubtless it’s certainly BiS for any kind of PvP, being in world, or dungeons if still running them. And it looks so hawt
---
You don't understand how itemization works and why people want it. 
---
To only to release gear based on what patch they were added but without progressive itemization will just remove 30% of the OP dungeon gear and the rest will remain ingame. 
---
To gate gear this way is just pointless and there is no solid argument to do so. It's like saying lets buff all of class X gear and let class Y have gated dungeon gear.
---
I’ve got my races narrowed down to undead or orc. Orc lock or UD mage/lock. My question is more profession based. 
---
Should I level as mining/engineer, or mining/tailoring then eventually drop mining for engineering at 60? Or, is there a better method I’m not seeing? Maybe mining/engineer then drop mining for tailoring?
---
I’m open to suggestions. Plan on leveling on a pvp server and joining a casual raiding guild at 60 when I get BiS. I would also like to primarily do PUG BGs or farm gold on nights that aren’t raiding. Hell even some world pvp.
---
No I do understand why people want it. I just don't think it is a great experience for people to have gear be bad or different, and know at a set date it will be updated to be good. That seems worse to me than the items being too strong for the content at the time.
---
I've always loved playing with Orc Warriors and speccing into even more stun resist. The Rogue Eater build.
---
I did! But 10/25-man isn't the same. I want the original!
---
It''s only partially true, on aoe fights you have a much more challenging and entertaining rotation, then you hit AQ40 and spec fire and shit really gets interesting :D
---
I'd remove your bc Box key. Someone can take your account with that.
---
What is sapper and lip? And doesn't flamestrike not work well in fire resistant situations? 
---
Unless you want to make a new wow account for classic.
---
same and I honestly think ppl are gonna leave blizzard cause they are gonna fuck it up somehow. 
---
This is kinda what I intend on doing. I really want to reap the benefits of uncontested herb zones for brack rotus and really all the other expensive herbs like grave moss. I know I won't be server first 60, or even first 60 of my class, but I do want to keep it under 2 weeks. If they have the original armorless mounts when the server starts that will also play a huge factor as to my playstyle, disregarding prebis in order to farm gold however I can. This may take the form of DM or Orb runs or whatever I can at the time.
---
Lol @ arcane power. Silly 1.12/pservers. 
---
Can you link where you found the official number from blizzard?
---
This is why I hate my retail mage and can't wait to main mage again
---
oh remember the good ol days when there are only a few specs that were viable. Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
While the Classic talent system feels more fun to put points Into, it ends up not being much different than retail. You end up with mostly 1-3 versions of a spec and that’s about it.
---
I also miss how you had class quests you had to do so you could unlock class abilities.  That stuff was immersive as hell, made it feel like you were actually working towards something, and often tested your competence with the class up to that point.
---
Why?
---
This is what I'm talking about. Gordax's shield looks like a solid level 42 green.
---
I agree with your final point.  I raided as both Horde and Alliance on Nostalrius is good guilds
---
Alliance PvE was very noticeably easier, which I found to be quite boring
---
I didn't expand on it but you are absolutely correct. Half the fun was leveling when I first played, there was limitations on hardware (for a time I played on a Pentium 2 computer with dial up). I feel like I genuinely experienced the best (and worst) of leveling up but thoroughly missed out on (most) end game content. So I was hoping to get the most out of end game pvp/pve.
---
The ability to create female characters for the rampant sex economy for no cost in tandem with it's popularity among low level characters is what caused the innocent city's downfall on Moonguard. Roleplayers needed a congregation spot that wasn't among the Capital Cities halls so they could carry out their sexual misdeeds without being reported to the Stormwind Guard. Unfortunately the closest settlement to them was Goldshire and they took advantage of the beds found in the inn. 
---
Oh of course.  Warlock doomguard and infernal were nigh worthless, but they were still awesome to complete the quest for and say you had.
---
Considering I raided all content as ret and my buddy tanked as a paladin, people just need to stop feeding into min max memes 
---
Wee bit sexist innit? To say that stringing men along is what "women do"?
---
I really hope I can locate a guild in my timezone or atleast matching raid times. I won't be able to raid except after 9pm PST. Most think that's a bit late but it's the perfect window for me.
---
9pm PST happens when this comment is 2 hours and 57 minutes old.
---

I'm a bot, if you want to send feedback, please comment below or send a PM.
---
Yep. I had several mains, but after hearing the shit ret got I went ret Paladin with all its gimpy glory and never looked back. Not many people played my spec or my style so it was fun to be well known for my sheer dps and ability to wreck in PvP. Can’t wait to prove my favorite class as best again. (No, a ret should not ever be #1 dps in a 40 man raid, but I have hit 3-4 a lot)
---
/rasp for me. It can be used in all sorts of ways depending on the context of the situation.
---
I never played a caster but I assumed the wands were for when you went oom and were trying to regen or something.
---
/cheer on my night elf female

---

---
I thought it was 33.3% (repeating it course)?
---
&gt; Yeah there's no such thing as being able to correctly remember droprates from 13 years ago with that level of precision.
---
Yea lol, its not like there are databases with recorded the drop's of tens of thousands of players.
---
Drop rates are probably the most accurate statistics on pservers. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
I can't imagine just making crossrealm BG's an optional queue being such a big deal.  Not everything has to be all or nothing.  At least that's what most people seem to be wanting.
---
You have many instances where you will be using AoE (AE, CoC, Blizzard), decursing, sheeping, weaving in scorches/fire blasts when mobs are at low health and don’t have time for a frost bolt, etc. But, yes, if you’re on a tank and spank encounter, you’ll be spamming frost bolts for the entire fight. 
---
Except wands do far, far less damage than 70% of a frostbolt, so it's kind of a moot point.
---
The Lands of Conflict novel stated that there were around 20,000 high elves living in Stormwind alone, and there were others living in human settlements and a sizable chunk also at Theramore. I think Blizzard could justify them enough being their own race given how many canon said were left.
---
For night elves, I don't see any reason of them joining the alliance. There an (until recently) an immortal race and have on several occasions looked down upon the lesser races. There is the justification that they wanted the support in Ashenvale, however when you quest there almost every alliance NPC in the zone is a night elf, and there really isn't any reference to any other races assisting them. And I don't see why they would need alliance help to hold off the orcs. The only conflict they lost to the orcs is when Grom drank the blood of Mannorath in WC3.
---
Along with that, humans and gnomes practice the arcane, which the Night Elves have always abhorred. 
---
The frost mage rotation you'll use the most through your Mage's life is
---
Conjure Water -&gt; Conjure Water -&gt; Conjure Food -&gt; Conjure Food -&gt; Arcane Intellect
---
You'll usually do this rotation about 40x before you'll run an evocate, if you're specced into it.
---
Sylvanas burnt down an empty tree
---
Back in the day /cheer.... and now... /sigh 
---
Lol rose tinted glasses for sure. As if everyone didn’t follow cookie cutter builds lol. 
---
&gt;It's a single sub, so playerbase is a moot point as far as blizzard is concerned. They don't care if you're playing classic, retail, or both as long as people are paying. 
---
That's just wrong though. They will care because they'll need to distribute their budget based on where people are playing.
---
If classic kills retail they'll need to move budget over before they waste it all on a retail expansion no one will buy.
---
All she ever wanted to do is study.
---
Yeah pretty much what everyone else is saying, Alliance has a better leveling/questing experience, unless you really like barren/desert areas, Also Alliance has nicer cities to hang out in, though i personally love TB+Org, Horde has better racials in general, though alliance arent far behind with stoneform/escape artist, Horde has it easier getting around the world too + easier access to dungeons + AQ/Naxx Whilst alliance has easier access to MC/BWL, and well pallies are amazing in pve/pvp, a well geared ele shammy can bring some crazy burst to bgs though + Windfury is fun as melee
---
Tbc bm had nasty dps.  Started the exp as a prot war and switched to my bm hunter.  I was beating people with way better gear than me.
---
Pretty sure Vurtne was famous for elemental mage?
---
I like this idea. It has some nuance, and other than the mindless no change zombies, should appeal to most peoples idea of community and vanilla.
---
Gotta fireblast whenever there's a mechanic that you need to move for though!
---
I recognize the meme but does this have other merit to it? Is it referring to warlocks countering some classes depending on one pet, and other classes with another?
---
thinking of going a gnome. most likely a warrior, will my chances for getting in groups be down because im a little guy?
---
Thing is, it's not really a change, it's a compromise between 2 separate states of vanilla - think of it like progressive itemisation for the queue system :D
---
I think it's okay to have unfun things in your game. Is leveling Leatherworking from 260 to 265 a blast? Nah, it's a grind. It's fine, it's part of the game. 
---
Pfft don't listen to this, just go arcane.
---
Giving people a choice is bad in this scenario. It may seem unintuitive but MMO players will always take the path of least resistance, which is going to be the crossrealm option. 
---
We can't add the dungeon finder and just tell people, "well if you don't want it just don't use it". It just doesn't work that way. 
---
Yea you’ll spam frostbolt on a lot of my encounters. You’ll also have to decurse, sheep, frost nova and air during other fights. Pvp is a lot more interesting g for frost mages. 
---
Later on when you get to aq it switches quite a bit, not sure what the rotation is like though. 
---
Everything here is pretty tongue in cheek, but it does sound a wee bit!
---
They did. It should have been an engineering item rather than a quest reward, but otherwise I see no problem with it.
---
Judging something by appearance is a perfectly valid position. You're just sad that I'm making fun of your favorite emo race.  
---
To see you get so triggered that you pull out nerd lore as some kind of arguing device is funny though. You're just DYING to make an account full of emo elves if TBC Classic is announced aren't you? I bet your hair does that flippy thing in real life.  
---
Thunderfury generally went to the main tank who was also either GM or an officer
---
I like your points in healing focus I respect that, however matyrdom is way better for leveling/PVP. Resist talent as well is dope. This is what I plan on going as a troll priest possibly:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bA0MsZbZEMGz0pRt
---
When I hit 57 is respec disc for healing tons of dungeons. Id, get healing focus and matyrdom and imp swp all by level 25 and that is my core, from there to shadowform then to meditation. Mindflay doesn't take off til 44 anyways. This is just my preference as a PVP server build, cast time is super important
---
Lol no. You chose one of the cookie cutter builds or you didn't do anything.
---
How does having a heavily popped server obliterate rpg/pve aspects of the game? Only makes it feel more alive, imo.
---
The talent tree was a huge facet of the game?
---
Indeed, it can't be optional, otherwise people will queue for whatever gives them the easiest ride. Something that's just part of the queue system, like how the arena mmr works where the longer the queue the wider the net is to open a game.
---
I've never used a cookie cutter spec.  I PvP way too much for that.  Even back in Vanilla, we all knew the best-optimized specs and almost no I played with ran the cookie cutter spec.  We wanted some stuff for PvP, some for PvE and just some that suited our play style.
---
Move budget where? Classic is Classic, is Classic. Why move unnecessary budget into a completed game? They're obviously capable of recreating it and distributing it based off current subs alone. All classic does is generates revenue that's been getting lost by private servers, which will go to future expacs/tbc classic/other projects. 
---
Despite "low" sub count they still rake in an ass-ton of money a month not including services like server transfers, faction changes, etc. They could release an expac for free and still make money on it, the box cost is pennies compared to the income from subs. They don't need people to buy anything, they just need them to be subscribed whether it's for classic *or* retail. People who only play classic are going to be paying $180/yr for the next retail expac while never receiving content themselves. Bonus though, you can play retail up to the previous expansions with just a sub now, so if they ever make a worthwhile expansion it's only $60 to get into it
---
True, you either sucked, or you used the cookie cutter builds.
---
He was talking about mages when he referenced Vurtne.
---
Lol I've heard. Switching specs for a raid! The joy!
---
You’re lying to yourself. 
---
Lol thank you. 
---
Ah man I remember how excited I was to get my guild to play doom guard roulette with me for the first time.
---
Hi everyone. Former classic dwarf priest raider/raid leader/GM through partial aq/naxx looking to join others for classic. I’m looking for a late morning/early afternoon raiding guild to accommodate work and family schedule. Hoping there’s enough of us out there. Happy guild hunting! 
---
Yikes!
---
I was a male gnome and anytime the raid was standing around too long for my liking I would keep doing /train. That annoyed a lot of people but I loved it 
---
/laugh followed by /no
---
Anytime.
---
And for the record mages, the salty downvotes just make this funnier.
---
Shadowform for Shadow Priest.
---
Holy shit you're the first person I've seen point this out and you're 100% right. Why is no one talking about this? 
---
I'm not sure I'm even going to bother playing now. What's the point? 
---
Even in the event of running a cookie-cutter build, though, there's a neat sense of progression when you are getting very small pieces of something every single level.  Rather than every 5 or 10 or w/e it is now.
---
Individually, 1% crit chance or something on a level up feels pretty small.  But over time all those little 1% bonuses add up in glorious fashion.
---
Haha, right?  Come on guys, just click it, you know you want to!
---
Well you at least get the positives of finding what you want on the AH for a reasonable price. 
---
I loved and really miss those talent trees, but by the time they got rid of them, it was 100% theorycrafted and everybody used exactly the same builds.  There really wasn't any choice, unless you wanted to deliberately be 2nd best.
---
Absolutely.
---
I'm just pushing back against this naive idea that talent trees encourage experimentation and versatility. They don't, and not just because respecing is cost-prohibitive.
---
Stormwind and IF were rough if you had dial up. 
---
Yeah....it was pretty bad. Tried to stay away from Goldshire after I started on Moon Guard.
---
Most didn’t, just like most didn’t raid 
---
I was talking about world pvp which a lot of times is unorganized and Orcs have the strongest PvP racials for that. 
---
Lol, 100% agree with you on how ridiculous that sounds.
---
But just to play Devil's Advocate for a second, I can see merit in the concern that Classic is going to offer an endgame that was never actually fully realized.
---
The “original” Vanilla experience did not include many players getting Naxx gear and completely wrecking everyone in PvP before TBC was launched three months later.
---
That being said, I love the idea of leaving 1.12 “running” and seeing what would have happened had TBC not actually come out so I don't actually think it's a bad thing, but I acknowledge other people might be terrified of this.
---
You say no friends playing? Go Horde. Flip vanilla as you know it upside down.
---
I've always played Horde (played every expac for bits and pieces since wotlk, but didn't even play BC or Wotlk as much as vanilla) and really want to play Alliance to experience everything from their end. But my friends are all dead set on playing Horde again, and playing with them again is pretty important to me. I almost envy your freedom.
---
But then you leave players without an option when their server is 90% one faction or is dieing after the boom.  Telling players tough luck on your 7 hour queues or you have to merge servers to PvP is far worse imo than being given a crossrealm choice.  In the end we're left choosing the lesser of two evils just so every once in a while we can say "oh i know that dude" in a BG.  I understand that's part of the community aspect but having to merge or not queue at all is going to be far more destructive.  No one wants to make sacrifices but one needs to be made somewhere in this chain, they're all connected events.
---
Gotta hold you to those high standards I know you're capable of. Love you, man.
---
I never did.
---
Yeah just at first glance I heavily disagree with a lot of what I see.
---
Engineering adds some utility for sure, but is expensive and time consuming to level... unless you are already rich and are leveling a Paladin alt, I would go with skinning+mining/herbalism. You can always take engineering at max level once you're financially stable.
---
Also, the talent choices are questionable with imp BoM right at the start.
---
Seems like this guide is for paladins who have money to burn and lots of consumables handy, not a first character or average player.
---
Those aren't the only stuns though. Fire mage talent impact (2 sec), Priest talent blackout (2) bm Hunter intimidation (3?), definitely paladins too. So that's 6 of the 8 alliance classes.
---
You got downvoted even though that's what it says when you convert to binary :\  
---
holy shit dude chill this is why people think the classic community is toxic
---
I'm going to hit 60 as fast as I can since I'll end up playing an overplayed class and I need to get into a good guild early so I don't get fucked over getting gear.
---
Mage's single target attacks are boring as fuck.  One of the major reasons I hated leveling my mage and why I spent more time in Dungeons than was healthy for leveling.  In dungeons, I could provide CCs, AOEs, and greatly enhance the group.
---
Cold blood and adrenaline rush, as combat daggers, you can kill an equally geared r14 warrior in 1 burst
---
I don't think you understand the post..re-read it, because I'm not talking about having crossrealm or server only bgs, I'm talking about a combination of the two embedded in one bg queue.
---
There is no measurable downside. Evenly populated servers will only usually face people on their server, people who aren't on those good servers will still get better bg queues as the queue system expands to seek for matches. It's a better alternative than full crossrealm for everyone, and a better alternative than leaving people in 7 hour bg queues because of a massive imbalance.
---
/fart

If you want to be an engineer, then stick with mining/engineering. Mining alone is great for making spare gold at high levels. Engineering is more of a silly/pvp profession. I wouldn't plan on making much money off of engineering. If you want to be a tailor, I would recommend going tailor/enchanter, since you'll be able to disenchant the greens you make with tailoring. That said, I wouldn't change anything at 60. You'll be seriously hurting for gold if you end up as tailoring/engineering since you'd have to buy all your mats off the auction house to support engi. Also, you can make BANK with enchanting even if you barely level it and only use it for disenchanting items. Especially if you are the only enchanter in a group of friends that does a lot of 5 mans (since you can disenchant all the items no one wants and sell).
---
I expect nothing less!

Create a guild "Saturday Morning Cartoons" or some such. Plan for 9-noon raids. 
---
My wife and kid sleep in on weekends, and I have 7am to noon or 1 every weekend to myself. I'd raid those times in a heartbeat if you were PST server.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
As a member of the Horde, you get to be one of three honourable races and/or a spooky skeleton.
---
As a member of the Alliance, you get to be a puny, pale, bag of flesh bound to end up on the end of the sword of a noble horde champion.
---
The choice is obvious.
---
I remember reading back then about a gnome rogue that got Thunderfury before people know how much threat it generated for tanking. What a funny situation.  
---
Saved to come back and read and it’s gone. 
---
You might be able to find a late night WA guild.
---
Thats the reason otherwise. 
---
I use /cheer a lot for dings and random buffs, also use /laugh a lot
---
Just how it is, Naxx will be cleared 2 hours after release instead of 3 months. I would love to go back in time and experience Vanilla the way it was 14 years ago, it really was a treat. 
---
No
---
Of course they should have knowledge of what is updated and when, knowledge is power - people shouldn't be spoonfed everything, it's part of the reason why so many people are so excited about classic
---
What if had a bank alt for disenchanting?
---
You're just showing your own ignorance here
---
Continue with this line of thinking if you want your dungeon loot to be better than your raid loot for the first 2 tiers of content.
---
Tell blizzard that they aren't using progressive itemization
---
Every day a new pic of someones CD's and how they're ready.

I remember accidentally putting a point in the wrong slot. F
---
&gt; Pom-&gt; fap -&gt; oil of immolation
---
Instructions unclear, I was with you on the porn followed by fapping (I mean, why dps MC trash right?) but you lost me at the immolation... is there a secret trick I'm missing?
---
So, in stead of having the items replicate the statistics they had at equivalent points in vanilla, you'd rather overhaul the entire game to fix a problem you're creating by not having items in their correct state throughout vanilla.
---
Just raid in the morning, friend. It might feel weird but honestly early morning raiding can be fun. If you get that progress you've been looking for it can really carry you throughout the day. Looking forward to Molten Core after a hard day of work has long been one of my favorite aspects of WoW.
---
or if you just increase server cap to like 6-8k you never need cross realm unless its to counter premades dodging 
---
Pvp is in my opinion the point of vanilla wow.
---
Either /train or /smell
---
And that means progressive itemisation is somehow bad now?
---
I'm hoping Ateish goes to whomever has been with the raid the longest but honestly this all depends on the guild.
---
Movement speed could be more useful that straight dps in pvp though.
---
Raiding in vanilla is just a means to get pvp faster anyway 
---
Just put your talents into enhance but keep a set of gear with int for healing 
---
I didn't regularly play on Moon Guard but I did drop by Goldshire once in a while. It's like a zoo.
---
Disagree.  I knew plenty of rogues that went mace/hemo.  And plenty of rogues that went full 31 combat swords for raiding post BWL.  And dagger rogues.  For rogues at least, weapon choice was never an illusion.  Depended on what you wanted to do and how hard you wanted to fight for gear.  Only weapon spec you didn't use was Fist Spec and that's because fist weapons were ass in vanilla.
---
Too bad that in 15+ years we've never had all 3 talent trees merged together. 
---
Classic is not a complete game. The devs themselves have stated that. 
---
As a casual player classic is a lot better than retail 
---
That doesn't work, because an 8k pop cap could have 7k horde and 1k ally. It's to counter imbalance not to counter activity.
---
Vanilla gun sounds are my favorite.
---
Good, now that we understand eachother, it would appear that blizzard intend to go the "K3" route with itemisation...which isn't ideal.
---
Meaning that if it was in the game at launch, it'll have its 1.12 stats - but items added later will be added in their respective content patches/stages. That's my understanding of it at least.
---
&gt; I don't recall: did they ever give paladins a seal for aggro?
---
Yes, but everyone forgets Seal of Fury.
---
As to why they left Protadins unfinished until TBC, its because they had no good ideas about how to design their taunt. Here's the explanation from the horse's mouth himself, Kevin Jordan:
---
&gt; “We wanted his taunt to be more of a rescue operation than a direct insult, right? Like, a Warrior is just like: ‘Hey you, you’re a jerk, come attack me.’ Very direct: I’m intimidating. Whereas for a Paladin the idea was: ‘Oh, one of my friends is in trouble, I’ll cast a spell on my friend and it will transfer the threat to me and get that monster to come over.’ So that’s more in mind with the thematic of: He’s a protector and a saver, rather than, you know, like a direct yelling and screaming.
---
&gt; So that’s was the thematic approach. The mechanics were difficult because it was much harder to switch targets and use an ability on a friend without the smart targeting stuff that eventually went in. It wasn’t just, you know, hit taunt on the thing that you were already targeting, so we had some mechanical difficulties. He was fine generating threat as long as the thing was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat—whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt, you can’t take it away, right? Like, anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? Why would you do this to us? Just give us the thing back! It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. 
---
&gt; We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went, but our goal and our philosophy was to always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the Paladin tank a certain way, make the Warrior tank a certain way, and to a lesser extent make the Void Walker tank a certain way. Just have him feel differently, have them function differently, so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.”
---
[Seal of Fury](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Seal_of_Fury) replaced with Righteous Fury in 1.9.
---
I believe this is ideal unfortunately if we use 1.12 talents.  The talents make the lower tier content faceroll not the itemization.
---
It makes it feel alive with players you will never see again, similar to retail 
---
I remember coming across a hunter with it in WSG. Every since, I've always hoped to one day have the confidence of the man who claimed Thunderfury as hunter-loot.
---
You took the one talent tree setup per spec or you didn't get to invited to shit? Vanilla talent tree had its diversity but at the upper levels there wasn't shit, it was 1 simulated cookie cutter talent build.
---
They're adding content past naxx?
---
Hopefully.  A lot of us would much prefer that to TBC being released. 
---
A lot of Aussies suffered 100+ms pings playing on US Blackrock for years before they got oceanic realms and did just fine.

I miss fighting with one handed swords ⚔️ 
---
Overall it makes leveling Engineering easier and cheaper. You'll be able to make new recipes earlier. Schematics you craft will stay orange 15 levels longer for you than everyone else.
---
Also it's a pretty big perk to the Mechanical Dragonling. The Dragonling's level equals your Engineering skill /5. So a Gnome can make a level 63 Dragonling.
---
Tier 1 and tier 2 is already easier than LFR on private servers with progressive itemization.
---
The lower tier content is not made faceroll by the talents, the lower tier content is made faceroll because the content is just that, faceroll.
---
The big problem without progressive itemisation is that the items you get in dungeons will outperform items in the first 2.5 tiers of raid content. This is no joke, go and research it yourself, there are countless examples. One that springs to mind is Savage gladiator chain which will last you until Naxx (if you're unlucky with Skeram drops). It's from a level 54 boss mob in BRD... BUT, this item wasn't upgraded to its 1.12 state until patch 1.10, before which it's useless for fury and bis for tanking. Whereas in classic it will be bis for fury warriors from the second the server goes live (assuming no progressive itemisation) - until either the Skeram chest from AQ40 (very rare) or the trashdrop chest from Naxx.
---
Having 1.1 talents would not make MC hard, it would just make the classes terribly balanced in other aspects of the game - and those who want progressive talents through vanilla have zero idea what they're talking about - and here's why - the first class overhauls were done in patch 1.6 (BWL patch) for warriors and warlocks and the last update was done to rogue in patch 1.12. Each class was done periodically patch by patch in the intervening time. Essentially you would have patch 1.12 warriors and warlocks running around in patch 1.6 onwards making them ridiculous by comparison to other classes.
---
Patch 1.12 is the point in which they were ALL in their updated/overhauled/rebalanced state - hence it's the best patch to base Classic on.
---
The healing macro for healing groups to show who was being healed to party only.  
---
Lets you use higher lvl recipes before anyone else but yea once maxed it's useless.
---
I'm not sure about the recipe/level but it might be useful in battleground brackets if you could use bigger bombs or gadgets that the horde can't use.  Not sure though.
---
id be fine with *polled* minor tweaks to the game, after all if the community wants it, and it stays "classic-esque" I don't see why small changes can't be made to make some classes actually competitive. It doesn't have to be a slipper slope if they do it properly
---
you are correct
---
&gt; Druids are amazing healers and I would always want a few in my raid.
---
The consensus around here seems to be that they are categorically inferior to priests, paladins and shamans as raid healers and that you want one or two around for paw buff and that's it.
---
So I cannot agree that they are "amazing healers", because they are the worst healers. I suppose we could call them "amazing" and every other healing class "super duper amazing" but that seems weird.
---
&gt; Also they still get main spec gear just as fast as anyone else, with tons of off spec gear basically for free when noone needs. Geared tank in 5 man you are healing? Free gear. Geared rogue? free gear
---
My experience on a paladin in the TBC era was that it was rarer than you might think for unwanted off-spec gear to drop, because geared players didn't really want to run content that didn't drop gear for them. Sure there will be a window where your rogue buddy has most of the stuff they want but not quite all, and you can grab duplicate drops, but the minute they have everything they want they tend to stop returning your calls when you say "hey lets run that dungeon again ten more times so I can get all the offset lewt I want".

You my friend need to lookup Zulp rage compilations. Eastern EU at its finest
---
Favorite is /spit when I'm ganking on my rogue. It seems to produce the most rage whispers. I guess that won't be a thing in classic though unless they have 2 accounts. Most used is /wave and /thanks on my main.
---
Definitely. Picking talents was THE thing that drove me to play for one more level every time I should have logged off. I never used cookie cutter builds until I had maxed out and was making thinks and stuff. Part of the beauty was that it didn’t matter THAT much for leveling, you might be slower or faster but you’d never know your first time through and you could pick anything you wanted and be viable enough. And none of it mattered in the end because you could respec for the raids. 
---
&gt;I am assuming speccing into resto far enough for Mana Tide is absolutely required for raids
---
Not the ones you mentioned.  You're going to get stuck into a melee group where it only benefits you.  So as long as you have the appropriate consumables and some decent MP5 then you're golden.
---
&gt;but will I miss having it in dungeons and BG's at 60? 
---
It's going to be pet stomped so no.
---
No the beginning content was not faceroll on original servers.  It was easy but no where as easy as it is on private servers.  The talents made a huge difference and some items like i said changed to fit the new class themes and were not catch up mechanic items.  You going to have all the hybrid classes absolutely suck even more than they did in original classic. The game is meant to be played with 1.12 talents along with 1.12 itemization.  Not some strange combination of 1.1 and 1.12.  It would be a disappointing launch in my eyes.  This norm in private servers is some kind of Frankenstein
---
Wow that's awesome. I really appreciate your help. 2 sources and very good response time. I wish I could give you a AAA+++++ rating lol

Sounds familiar. Got a couple months to make the call on orc or troll

/spit should be the only emote used in game
---
that's good to hear because everywhere I see people absolutely trash paladin and say its boring to level as well, I havn't considered making one but as long as its viable in PVP that's all I really care about
---
Holy shit, I was in this guild! 
---
I still say BC had the perfect talent tree set up. If I could change one thing in classic it would be to use BC talent trees that's it. 
---
yes? lol
---
Everquest is doing it right, they have their normal live servers and their hardcore progression servers, that way everyone can play what they want and blizzard makes a lot money. 
---
Thanks man, I think I'm gonna roll rogue! For alliance side, which race is best? Or are the racials really as important as everyone says?
---
they do if you are a noob, which most of us were in vanilla, so you should not be surprised people are saying that they were
---
sometimes when you are playing a game, illusion is exactly what you want
---
This is a great comment. Ultima Online boiboi.
---
People here are mostly, not only happy, but borderline zealots in defending the specific rolls classes have and defending how useless non meta are
---
You can. But mageweave is more expensive than runecloth and more importantly you will require vastly more mageweave since the chance of leveling be extremely low for the last levels.
---
See, disagreeing with something just because private servers have done it is a really stupid argument. The amount that blizzard can learn from pservers and the pserver community is enormous. These are vanilla's biggest fans, with years of experience playing albet imitations of vanilla. I'd argue that their perhaps not 100% accurate experience from pservers trumps someone's anecdotal memories from retail vanilla.
---
I played since 2 months after vanilla launch, and I remember MC being more difficult, but I also thought that dungeon t0 was my pre raid bis, as did the rest of my raid. Given what we know nowadays it's no surprise to see that things seem easy by comparison.
---
The talents are only a minute part of a multi varied argument. Are you aware that boss hp, armour, and resistance values were changed significantly throughout as well? If this matches the original values then this will make the content more difficult compared to pserver content.
---
Hybrid classes suck in classic, they have their niches in solo pvp/world pvp, and you can clear the content with any class because it's fundamentally straightforward. However, to fully optimise your raid/premade you won't bring hybrids - that's just a fact, but vanilla is vanilla, and it's not a hybrid friendly version of the game - and having stupidly OP catch up items in from launch isn't vanilla imo.
---
&gt; they do if you are a noob, which most of us were in vanilla, so you should not be surprised people are saying that they were
---
That makes no sense. Versatility means you are able to adapt on a whim to different playstyles often. Prohibitive respec costs prevent this.
---
Experimentation only works if you're able to A-B changes. The fact that you only gain one talent point per level and are married to your build for most of your play time prevents this as well.
---
I think we're just talking past each other. To me, versatility doesn't mean the option to fuck up your build for ten levels. Experimentation isn't defined as wasting points into noob-traps because you didn't read a guide that explains how talents synergize properly.
---
But if that's your definition of those words then I can't argue against it.
---
By producing cheap and selling expensive
---
You seriously had a good point going on in that post until that chauvinism started leaking.
---
I've actually thought about it a lot and the counter to your argument is usually "cookie cutter and no REAL choice just more filler" but in my opinion the ILLUSION of choice is better than being funneled into a choice and small incremental rewards while leveling is a lot better than a large reward over 15 levels, I feel like a mixture of both would be best, make the talents system like people make a battlepass in a battle Royale game, small rewards into a medium reward, eventually working to tier 20-40-60-80-100 where the large rewards are (Spec defining skills) 
---
The only rotation that never really became muscle memory for the whole time I played WoW was early wotlk fetal Druid.... that rotation was a lot of fun.  Keep mangle up&gt;savage roar&gt;rip&gt;rake and if they are all up you may ferocious bite.  But I agree the most fun I had raiding is when I had a simple rotation like a ret pally 
---
Probably an unpopular opinion here, but I like both systems. I like that retail talents actually all do cool stuff and can change up your play style a lot. 
---
However, I miss being able to combine the different specs. I want to use ice, fire, and arcane all at the same time as a mage, not choose between the 3. That's why I don't play a mage now. I also miss getting a talent point every level. Even if it was just 1% critical chance, it felt good to put in the point.
---
Overall I like the old system more, but I think it could incorporate some ideas from the new system too.
---
I agree with WOTLK but would also say that they were super fun in BC as well. Reason being - arcane became a viable spec. I really like arcane mage and did most of my pvp as arcane. 
---
I played on Nost from the beginning, and there wasn't really any shock and awe from people who never played wow from what I experienced. I never played in a guild for too long and would just jump in as a plus one, and raids got cleared super fast. Vanilla is easy, and the shock and awe of people doing the impossible will be gone. 
---
"Be the change you want to see in the world", I've got to say, this is the least important thing I've ever heard this phrase used for. Not that i don't care about raiding too haha.
---
I doubt it my friend. They said summer and no one really considers June as summer.  More likely it comes out in August then anywhere close to June. You're in a good spot there.
---
The idea of 'pristine' servers, 'season' servers and 'new content' servers has been kicked around a bit. 'pristine' server type would never go beyond 1.12. 'season' servers would run for a certain amount of time and then reset. 'new content' servers would have community led content added.
---
It all depends on the success of classic, though. If the game sustains a million players (let's say) and then after a year its down to 200k -- they're likely to introduce seasons, at least. It's one of the things that the pserver community loved. 
---
Exactly full T3 will still be very hard to get because Naxx is just broken, but everything else is cake for people who are raiding heroic+ today. 
---
If it really was just frostbolt spam, you'd see all mages doing about the same damage in raids. As it's been said, It depends a lot on the specific fight but I'd say overall it's about 80% frostbolt through bwl. But there is room in that last 20% to distinguish between good and bad players. Also really important is how you deal with mobility and positioning to maximize your casting time. There are surprisingly few boss fights in mc and bwl where you can expect to just stand and cast the whole time. 
---
Hey guys,
---
So this is a subject that I get asked about all the time; who will do better in Classic raiding, retail guilds or Classic guilds?  
---
Because it's world first race season, I figured I would chime in on the topic.
---
Hope you enjoy &lt;3
---
\-Tips
---
It really depends on the guild, TF usually went to main tank, it did sometimes go to Rogues back in Vanilla though, due to the fact that few people actually documented the amount of threat it gave early on. Most people didnt know about the the threat it gave and even if they "heard" about it, it didnt mean anyone really understood how good it was for threat.
---
Sulfuras was generally a DKP bid. Its very good, but its more cosmetic since its not a PvE weapon and Ashkandi beats it as well as later weapons in AQ40 and Naxx. 
---
Black Qiraji Battle Tank went to the person that people knew was willing to farm the most. Basically the biggest no lifer in the guild.
---
Atiesh I imagine varied wildly. When my guild got our first splinter we just had bids, since we hadnt been able to down C'Thun yet and we all pretty much had given up hope on clearing KT before BC. I imagine most of the guilds that actually had a shot at forming it loot counciled it because only the real tryhard guilds would be in that position.
---
As for Arcanite and such, it really depended on the guild. It actually doesnt take a good guild to get TF Bindings, just a lucky one. Ive seen a guild that didnt lift a finger to help their tank get his TF, only providing him with the Elementium Ore from raids, though this is a rare case. Though for Sulfuron Hammer, you were usually on the hook to get it made yourself (trying to find a Hammersmith with Dark Iron rep, loooooooooooool)
---
I was more thinking for a new server where there will be no runecloth yet.
---
I dont think it will work the way I want anyways. Mageweave you start picking up off lvl 35 mobs. I wouldn't have nearly enough at the time I'm in arathi to manage 300skill. Since u can only pick up the quest at lvl 35 with 225skill.
---
I'd have to go back with about 350 mageweave or more.  so possibly at lvl 40 if I grind 35+ mobs. But the droprate on 35-40 is low. Like 5%. Improves at 40 it seems.
---
False
---
This is the hope that’s keeping me alive, lol
---
Maybe some of good ol arthas rubbed off in her. 
---
AQ mount (the legendary one) is from a long quest chain. It's not a drop.
---
**ANYONE** who can turn in the final quest during the 10 hour opening event will get the mount.
---
(Not just the first person that hands it in. (Many people seem to think it works this way.))
---
Unless you want to be allowed into groups with others 
---
Doing AH takes time and brain cells, right clicking a beast after it is dead and then right clicking the stack of leather by a vendor is pretty ez. 
---
I don’t remember when it happened that warlocks druids and paladins auto learned the class mount if they leveled so high but I deleted my warlock when I realized I couldn’t go do the diremaul fun I had helped friends of mine do.   Warlock was the last class I leveled, and I was so disappointed to be locked out of the experience.
---
We recently had Sulfuras drop and decided that it would be open roll for anyone that wanted it.
---
With the disclaimer that whoever got it would receive no help from the guild bank.
---
Only a druid and Pally rolled. The druid won.
---
Though, this scenario is probably a little different because it's on a pserver that'll shut down when Classic launches.
---
My reason to play vanilla is very simple.  I feel like with TBC,LK,CATA,Pandaren,WoD,Legion and BFA , the world has gotten too big and too complex. For example BFA you buy a 110 character and learn Kul Tiran version of Professions, without even experiencing much of the **World** of Warcraft.  
---
Am not some spoiled brat you and many others are trying to make me out to be. Am extremely content with there being no Dungeon Finder,Personalized loots and all other hand holding BS .  
---
I do not much about Vanilla WoW and am trying to find out about various things and why it is so .  
---
**If the various class difference(imbalances as perceived by many) is as you say them having Pros and Cons., I can surely live with it , in fact very glad it is so . Am just looking to make sure that is all there is to it .**  
---
*Am just surprised at the aggressiveness of it all , just because you guys had the luxury to enjoy WoW Classic and played a huge role i getting it back it doesnt mean you guys have a Holy Claim on everything WoW Classic and your thoughts are edicts of power.*
---
Items from the chain drop 1 per boss in most cases. Meaning one person is progressing per raid lockout period. They will be prioritized to the guild leader in the first run, to the guild leader's best friend officer in the second if it even happens before the gong is hit.  
---
I know how the AQ quest chain and gong works. It will be even harder in Classic to hit this inside the 10 hour window because people will be even more efficient at completing the chain than they ever were in vanilla.  
---
Omg guys there’s a mage in darnassus! 
---
Can I get a port to SW‽
---
I need some rank 3 food for my pet. I have 5 silver
---
If you're on horde, this wont be nearly as true.  
---
Mageweave will be in extreme abundance due to a horde-exclusive grinding location in Blasted Lands that is mostly sheltered from alliance PVP.  
---
There seems to be Great reasons and **explanations in support to NO CLASS CHANGES** as a reply to my comment/reply here , but sadly people down voting for all the wrong reasons is literally  hiding some great answers to my questions.
---
Interest, might have a play around with this idea for levelling. Would a similar spec work for raids if I healed but wanted to be ok killing things (as well as a pally can) out  in the world?
---
Sorry Tips, there is no world first here because the world first race was already done years ago.  [https://www.method.gg/raid-history](https://www.method.gg/raid-history)
---
The only thing that actually matters for classic is world speed records. 
---
I don't think making it spec focused really mattered.  Those were two separate design choices.
---
Maybe making gear work better with dual-spec (or omni-spec like we have now) mattered.
---
Couldn't any realm have a faction imbalance no matter the cap?  
---
I mean faction imbalance on servers is a conversation worth having for it's own problems regardless of the cross realm idea.  
---
I think it would've been cool to give a primer on some of the top Private server guilds. What makes their roster strong, leadership, past feats. 40 Alliance getting Warchief's Blessing?! Everyone knows Method, but only those private server initiated are familiar with the others you mentioned. 
---
Its amazing that you feel like your reason is the UNIVERSAL TRUTH for why people want to play WoW Classic.  
---
People hate Retail for a VARIETY of reasons . from what i have seen class balances seems  to be not that high on that list. Make a proper distinction between Class Balances (Fixing damage or Heal Numbers and some minor stuff)  vs Major Class reworks .  
---
BTW people keep saying classes are the way they are by design but some one pointed out that a class got a major rework from Release to 1.12.X .
---
As of right now I'd say the question is WILL they.
---
You might find a guild of people who work similar hours..
---
This reminds me of a time when my friend and I were running a dungeon on female characters.  My Mom, who is very conservative and never swears, goes "wow, the girls are really kicking ass!"
---
Whereas I refuse to even train that weapon skill.
---
Or just...TBC.
---
Not exactly. Classic WoW has had 0 raid content completed as of today as it hasn't been released yet. This is the first time anyone is going to play the Classic WoW Project. There will be a first guild in the world to beat x raid on Classic WoW. What you linked was the history of World of Warcraft. This is the present. This is Classic WoW.
---
GOOD POST , TY .  
---
I also read some where that  a class had a MAJOR REWORK going from release to 1.12.x , have to look that up , since that would also essentially defeat the lies of these people.
---
Such extreme enthusiasm like this makes people look desperate.  
---
I don't think a logical outlay of pros and cons is going to help your case.  
---
I think he is going horde because he wants to try something new, not because of the advantage/disadvantage scenario.  
---
You will be hard pressed to convince him.  
---
Here's my proposal instead: Say fuck that guy, because family is useless, and go be the Alliance we need you to be.  
---
Make sure you gank his ass when you see him leveling too.  
---
Thanks captain obvious 
---
It's the same game. #nochanges

I doubt they will even care about it

that is a sensible and acceptable logic , but one should also recognize the possibility that it also opens door to giving up power on fixes and balances and things stagnating.
---
With 1.12 talents, 16 debuff slots, and 10 years of private server experience, there is literally nothing impressive about getting a so-called "world first" in a re-released game. 
---
Whoever’s head was furthest up the GMs ass
---
Well in that case you're going to get a bunch of retail players who never play Classic voting to try and make Classic more like retail. 
---
Ahem. Arcane Brilliance. We aren't savages here.

Cant taurens aoe punt people off ledges ?

/cringe
---
Talent tree changed pre mop 
---
Its related in terms of dev hours spent on systems. They have basically tripled the amount of classes in terms of dev needs. They had to cut stuff back in other areas.
---
I personally thank you , all your posts on this topic has been very informative to me.  
---
On a side note ,i too very much believe what you think about Blizzard-activision relationship and their attitudes .  
---
Vanilla bossed have like 2 mechanics, not much to focus on other than staring at a threat meter 
---
Basically every 2 seconds your character regenerates mana/health, so if you are drinking at that 2 second mark then you get increased mana regeneration. Which means it's possible to walk for nearly 2 seconds, drink for a split second until the regen tick, walk another 2 seconds, etc. It's incredibly impractical as it requires tons of prep time conjuring the water.
---
Love it. You can feel the players sense of wonder and bewilderment through their characters. 
---
Not sure exactly how anyone can even fathom defeating the Firelord, but knowing that if it’s going to happen, it’s going to be working together that will do it.
---
ty for yor post , your post kinda feels like a bitter pill but atleast your explanation seems well informed and thought out.
---
Class balancing isn't happening, sorry. 
---
Thing is, you can't really fix the faction balance, it's never going to happen because there's always going to be a large degree of randomness.
---
My cross real suggestion is just a way to mitigate the effects of it, without ruining part of the vanilla experience.
---
Every class had a major rework. The funniest part is that Rogues got their huge rework in 1.12, which only lasted for three months. So if you played Rogue for most of Vanilla then you're going to be playing a Rogue in Classic that only existed for three months before 2.0 lol.
---
raising the cap to over 6k+ would be a worse change than sharding gtfoh 
---
Why not? It’s functionally the same as people doing speed run races of various other games, except this is more of a team effort and takes place over the course of more than just a few hours. Not everyone has to subscribe to arbitrary, personal ideas about what is a valid competition and whether or not it’s fun lol
---
No am looking for an answer even if its subjective , me saying that everyone has their own version of\*\*\* literally is me conceding that it is a subjective thing , am looking for people's reasons for being against it and a lot of people have given me really logical reasons which am able to accept and agree with. I usually make long posts and therefore use  bold  to highlight the core part of my post .
---
I'm leveling a warrior. It seems to be okay when I can get a group for the hard stuff. Does it get harder past 10 for regular questing? Will I be able to win in WPVP while leveling?
---
Based on a lore/gameplay perspective then, the horde provides a tougher challenge and proves the resilience of the faction? 
---
I would argue there's going to be a lot closer competition this time around than there was in vanilla. That to me makes it more impressive. With so much information available, guilds will be hard crunching those numbers and working out in secret, optimal leveling paths. Speed running is no joke. It doesn't matter what iteration of a game is being played, it takes a ludicrous amount of dedication. Especially for an MMO. That number of variances these guilds will have to deal with is crazy. It's more than any other speed run in gaming history. 
---
A LOT of people are responsible for bringing back WoW Classic , and a lot of them have differing reasons as to why Classic is Good and what Retail is missing or did wrong . While the problem is complex and might not have a solution, trying to act like the problem in  essence does not exist and there is one UNIVERSAL REASON for wanting WoW Classic over Retail i feel is wrong.
---
Thank you for spelling it right. 
---
Cringe
---
You dropped your fedora btw

gold.
---
Let’s be honest thicc Jaina from current retail is peak Jaina 
---
thunderfury goes to main tank first for sure. usually offtank second. third one can go to a dps. most guilds help fund it (at least for the mt). my guild has thunderfury on maintank and bindings on 2nd tank, 4th tank and our old mt whos quit.
---
hand of rag goes to whoever has the money to make it or is willing to farm that much (its close to 10k gold), usually a paladin, shaman or warrior. its a pvp weapon used by meme specs (ret, enhance) or a warrior who would probably be better off with asscandy/bre/r14 and sword spec tbh. my guild gave it to a warrior btw
---
ateish would go to your top caster that also wants to do the quest (for minmaxing technically mage is the best). but in my guild the top 2 mages dont even want it lol, one only cares about pvp and the other is gonna quit after we clear naxx 1 time. it could go to anyone who was dedicated to the guild though. you've beaten the game at that point anyway.
---
Its a chicken or egg which came first  issue if you put it that way , i personally think  Blizzard kept making changes looking at Short Term needs of the players while slowly missing out on the bigger picture. Cant blame them , there is no saying that player base would have been Healthy or BIG if they maintained their original development attitudes , t**hat is a very big IF one that companies like blizzard cant afford to mess around with.**
---
Pservers will still have the ruskis
---
They have traded self-expression and immersion for *running out of content faster*. Min-max addiction is so weird. 
---
I wonder what fraction of the vanilla playerbase will suffer from it. I have no interest in coming back to a game in which every party member cares about nothing other than clearspeed and measured performance.

IMO very much get a feeling that as long as WoW Classic is released and if blizzard reputation is not damaged further, players in masses are going to request balances  based on what i have read on this particular Reddit discussion.
---
thank you for this post , this pretty much greatly dissuades the ," by design" myth.
---
You have to remember that most of the ranged dps are really only spamming their main ability. Frostbolt, shadowbolt, hunters weave aim shot in between auto shots if they have a slow enough weapon, ele sham spams lightning bolt, idk wtf boomkins do but whatever it is it runs them dry real fast in pve. Shadow priests requires a lot of wanding because, again, no mana sustain. But when you get down to it the melee classes don't have much more. Spamming sinister strike as a rogue and then switching up your finisher depending on what you need. Warriors just sort of mash their face on the keyboard and whatever they have the rage for gets used.

It's just not about rotations in vanilla, it's about the adventure with 39 other people. 
---
You’re taking this shit way too seriously 
---
How did Gordax go?
---
Have you played Vanilla? Several pally prebis items are not plate. 
---
If I wanted to follow a script I'd just watch a movie. You're underestimating the number of people who care about experimentation, exploration and self-expression over being numerically superior because you fall into the latter camp.
---
Personally it should ask you at the start of que and every 5 min thereafter. Personally just want faster ques and couldn't care less either way blizzard goes with it. I really hope I don't have to wait 10+min for a match tho. People got shit to do honestly
---
There was a survival hunter who had Tfury on one of the private servers and just went for a full melee build. Funny thing was that it actually worked really well in pvp.
---
Did I just see someone say saving Azeroth from elemental lords and evil dragons all while acquiring sweet epics was NOT IMPORTANT?
---
Pre-60 it's definitely bestial wrath imo. Turn your elite mob pet into a bigger, redder elite mob pet that can;t be cc'd. Good like surviving against it for 18 seconds. 
---
There are cookie cutter specs in PvP, too. I can't think of any class that can get creative in higher level PvP, there are must pick talents across the board.
---
But how does that solve the problem that nothing new will ever come? I'm not even saying I need new content apart from what was available then, but it's a legitimate concern that we may see too few players to properly sustain the game long-term if this doesn't find a way to entice new players to check it out. I spend my days around 12-15 year olds and when it comes to games this generation is near unanimously uninterested in older games because "they can just watch a YouTube video" as I have been told. Look at today's games and there is nothing remotely similar to WoW seeing any real popularity and despite new MMOs coming out they all seem to fail in catching the attention the genre used to get.
---
 While I'm sure we can maintain 100k regular players for at least a few years, I'm concerned about how many people just assume 12-14 year old content will be enough to draw the new players that we need to realistically accept are needed to keep Activision Blizzard interested in this project, one they clearly weren't interested in until a few months before announcing classic. And we also need to worry about how many pserver players won't come over at all due to distrust of the company/jaded opinions from where Blizzard has brought the game currently. That is likely a decent population of the players we want to see join us, and if the opinions I hear on my server remain true we need to replace them.

Wait from what i remember she actively tried to smooth out Alliance-Horde relations in the beginning . Maybe she was working towards the Greater Good and put up with Horde but Theramore kinda shook her from that idiotic fantasy ? . I mean Horde cant keep pretending that they are not inherently a fucked up group when they keep repeatedly following bad leaders. #REVOLT

I’m debating playing on NA but don’t want to deal with the 120+ ping as I’m so used to &lt;20.
---
The best they ever were 
---
I'm still debating druid and priest.
---
I know the priest will be more fun in dungeons, but druid would fit my playstyle better in pvp.
---
When I tested paladin, I was so bored in dungeons... I'm afraid I might get bored with healing Touch as well. 
---
Although I know druid would be my kind of pocket healer in bg. 
---
Going to hardcore raid and casual bg pvp. 
---
Why would a Druid even want hand of rag.crowd pummelers are better 
---
Nearest physical game store to me is like 50 miles, fuck that shit.
---
Even if it wasn’t why the fuck do I want to go stand in the cold at midnight with a bunch of strangers.

Midnight releases were just a chore.

50.0 miles ≈ 80.5 kilometres ^(1 mile ≈ 1.6km)

No it is not lol. LFR can be done with zero communication, zero strategy zero brain. MC you need most people to know strats, etc etc. Yes its 100% easy if people know what there doing but LFR easy....no way.
---
I was in a guild that eventually cleared through some of naxx. On are first few attempts at MC we wiped plenty lol. Def harder than LFR

The real choice: 2 points in execute or 2 points in improved berserker rage ([https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVV0VxxoVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVV0VxxoVo))
---
The old talent trees were really good at giving us an illusion of choice, but in reality there wasn't much variety. You either used the cookie cutter spec, or you were playing a wrong spec. (Usually a pvp/farming/pve hybrid) Current talents actually have more choice, but aren't given to us in an interesting way, which is what i feel was truly the best part about old talents.
---
Idc if i have to pick the cookie cutter talents, i just enjoyed getting that new talent point every level.
---
I just think the intent is to literally make you feel like you’re “playing World of Warcraft from 2006”, at least that’s what Blizzard’s site says.  Everything else would seem outside the scope of the project’s intentions and deliverables.
---
Ahhh yeah good point. Omg... does this mean my actionbars won't be overcrowded for once!!!!!
---
Oh wow. I haven't heard of that before, thanks for explaining it. Yeah that sounds like lots of preparation but if it works it works I suppose. 
---
Yeah, being on a server/faction where you have the queuetimes is really bad honestly. that's why I think a system like this would work

No idea dude. But to be fair, he's probably one of the few people in our guild that would actually be mad enough to farm enough gold for all the mats themselves.
---
I think there is a perception bias from min-maxers like yourself who surround themselves with other min-maxers.
---
The vast, vast majority of Classic players were intensely casual and probably picked talents based on nothing more than which sounded cool. Granted, more people have probably moved over to the Spike mentality since 2004, but I think casuals who are more Timmy (experiential, cool-factor, power fantasy) will still outnumber Spikes ten to one.
---
Your experience of nu-Classic may even validate your perspective because of the people you surround yourself with (fellow optimizers), but it will ignore the experiences of the swaths of people who level INCREDIBLY slowly (I think I was at least 100 days /played on my first 60) and spend 90% of their time on non-progression content (socializing, exploring, PvP of all kinds, non-guided tradeskill levelling, socializing, helping underlevelled friends, doing underlevelled quests and zones because you enjoy them, pursuing weird cosmetics/toys/trinkets, etc etc) and probably don't see the inside of MC.
---
This kind of person is never ever going to look up a cookie-cutter spec.
---
This is what Classic was for most of the people who played it.
---
&gt;s that are fast, y'hear? If it ain't an axe with an attack speed lower than 3.50, you keep 
---
It's actually a hunter, axes are hunter weapons

It was literally in vanilla, yet people are used to pservers and don't want a real world solution.

Except in vanilla that wasn't a thing, at least not 1.12 &gt; [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12296](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=12296)
---
Only slows decay out of combat. Basically useless
---
I (like most players) was in a chilled out, casual guild who gave zero shits about performance and many shits about being nice to each other and having fun. It took us many many (many) months to clear MC and we had a blast.
---
Free yourself of the min-max shackles.
---
And this is what ticks me off so much about min-maxers. Like, sure, play however you want, but when you adopt the performance mindset, it seems to come with this expectation that everyone else in the group must think exactly like you do, follow all the meta specs, and so on. It has killed so many MMOs for me.
---
["Oh my god."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekP0LQEsUh0&amp;t=53)
---
I think this is bias based on the kinds of people you surround yourself with. I levelled a feral/resto druid in Classic and it took 100+ days /played. My guild leader was a paladin who *didn't spend talent points until level 60*. His mindset was analogous to someone who didn't want to build a puzzle without knowing all the pieces were in the box. He was supremely relaxed and patient (he would kill mobs over the course of like 2 minutes with auto-attacks).
---
I think people like you have forgotten what it is to play a game without striving to clear content as fast as possible. To a lot of us WoW was friends, exploration, or just goal-free messing around in a really immersive world.
---
Sorry, what was in vanilla? If you mean crossrealm then yes it was, but the majority of vanilla was server based bg queues. What I'm proposing should allow for the best of both. The server community remains intact and the over populated faction doesn't sit in 1 hour bg queues.
---
Absolutely! Hell, for some of us, customization/optimization puzzles like the talent tree _are_ the whole game. 
---
All the rest of the bits of actually going out and killing stuff are only good for 1) getting more points to spend in the talent trees and 2) testing theories about the efficacy of arrangements of points in the talent trees in varying circumstances.
---
Is that Ragnar from Vikings in the bottom right!? Haha
---
Most private servers are fairly even, with favor leaning towards the alliance. I'd imagine vanilla was maybe 60-40 
---
And this is the core of the factionalism in this sub. "High end raiding is the only game" vs "Classic was great because it wasn't just a rush to endgame grind"
---
Yes I am saying crossrealm BGs. I have suggested your exact proposition several times on this sub and people just shut it down, no discourse. This is why I won't be upset if blizzard just does it anyways because we can't find a compromise on it. It was in vanilla for a short time but it was there and it existed and it solved a real problem.   
---
You and I are asking for a compromise that solves a problem and tries to uphold integrity of server community. I just know in this day in age, plenty of people, including me, will not wait 10+ min for a match ( unless we're already doing something). This will create lots of dead pvp BGs on many real after the first 3 months.
---
I wonder if the playerbase will split along min-max / chilled lines and advertise groups as such.
---
Yeah, you're right. Hard to see why anyone wouldn't want this.
---
Crossrealm created as many problems as it solved. Hopefully they do it in a way that takes the best of both methods.
---
Seriously, the talent tree was pretty bland. You had limited choices and if you didn't actually use the optimal stuff you didn't do anything past dungeons.
---
This is a take I see often repeated but it doesn’t explain things for me. 
---
I’m not a min-maxer nor do I surround myself with min-maxers. I’m intensely interested in exploring suboptimal builds and trying to make them function properly. 
---
Like I said in another thread, there seems to be a misunderstanding of definitions. Experimentation gets equated ‘round these parts with “the freedom to pick bad talents.” While the freedom to fail is an important part of game design, don’t confuse it with experimentation—especially considering the high cost of respecing and the lack of immediate feedback on your choices. 
---
The Youtuber, caffeineinjected has been doing a Protadin leveling series the past month and I’ve been helping fine tune his build based on what we know now about how the game works. What I’ve discovered doing this is that Vanilla talent trees are simply the first (and therefore the worst) iteration of them. 
---
When thinking of how players handled this back in 2005, a lot of the behaviors that seem at first glance to be joyful exploration of “what sounds cool” are better explained by a lack of access to data about how spells and game mechanics actually worked. Considering how many folks pine for the era before Wowhead and data-mining this rings true.
---
For example, after discovering that Anger Management has a hidden mechanic of passively generating Rage during combat, I find it a stretch to believe that players won’t take that into account when making decisions about what talents to pick. 
---
Like I also said in another thread, this idea that it’s fun to pick talents that don’t synergize (or worse, actually work against themselves) because they’re “cool” betrays an ignorance about how Vanilla actually works. 
---
Talents just don’t work like that. They don’t give you instant access to flashy new abilities or mechanics. They play off each other. They’re incremental, and many don’t even show mathematically because gear rating pre-60 is so low (I’m looking at you Sanctity Aura). 
---
There’s no “power fantasy” when picking talents that don’t work together (or just plain don’t work!) And it feels very snake-oily to pretend otherwise. 
---
To run with your analogy, min-maxers have picked one of those variables to care about (let's call it top speed) and declared it the only worthwhile thing to improve.
---
The main way performance parts and new supercars are unlocked is a drag race, and top speed is the only thing that matters in drag races. Min-maxers are stuck in this loop of only caring about drag races and only being able to improve their drag racing by drag racing to get slightly better cars. 
---
And they become so consumed by this world that they forget that people are doing all sorts of other things with cars, like driving around to visit their friends or explore interesting corners of the world. And they get really upset when someone puts heavy plush seats in their car, or cripples its power for fantastic air conditioning or flashy lights.
---
&gt; No one played wow for it's talent tree.
---
Given that you are talking to such a person right now, it should be clear that that is incorrect.
---
Technically weren't mages mostly into arcane anyways, then either into frost or fire trees depending on the content they are doing?
---
No, classics world first hasn’t been done yet because classic hasn’t been released yet.
---
So the main reason WoW drew you in was it's miniscule talent tree?
---
Not the lore, or accessibility in a world of hardcore RPGs(for it's time), nor the world or the amazing graphics(again for it's time).
---
No what made you play wow, was having 60 points to out into a talent tree consisting of 90% filler skills that offered like 5% critical chance, or 10% hit chance, with maybe 2-3 actual abilities per tree, that was your #1 draw to the game?
---
&gt;I mean I don't see how racials are such a big deal. Racial are not significant enough compared to gear or talents, or have so high cooldown that, yes it does make a difference sometimes, but to the point of complaining? I mean Vanilla being awful in term of class balance is IMMENSELY more important than "racials being imbalanced" in TBC. I am wrong there?
---
Because the game has turned more "competitive" and want to min-max more.
---
Tbc is also a small continent, so most people will sway to one faction because its just not a great place for 50/50. Its either non-stop PvP 24/7, or one faction dominance per server (which is what we see for TBC private servers). Vanilla had two massive continents, massive zones and there was no flying. Alliance had pladins and horde had shamans, so there were reasons and strengths to play both faction. In TBC Horde is just better, and its the most glaring flaw in TBC imo, and is a trend that will keep WoW heading one direction for the rest of the expansions.
---
One-faction dominated servers due to small continents.
---
Immersion breaking to some.  I fucking hate pop culture making its way into games. Especially MMOs.
---
Survival talents are can be extremely good in the right situations.  Would be hilariously fun to do it with thunderfury.
---
No problem, private idiot? I guess? It's obviously not obvious to everyone as multiple people had to point it out to DruidGuy.
---
asap? get a few high level friends than do [mob tagging in instances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqoXOQHh1wY), SM can easily get you to ~40 in a few hours.
---
but since I doubt it will be a thing in classic, you're just going to have to silently weep your way to 60, because leveling a warrior is probably the most horrible thing in the entirety of wow.
---
Sign me up for that raid time.  I’d even prefer earlier like 7-10am Saturday or Sunday 
---
I've heard that arcane is good for leveling, yes. 
---
I remember arcane mages in BC but I think they added a patch to make them more viable with different specs in BC. still, i'd probably play arcane.
---
It doesn't matter. It still hasn't been done. And just because you don't like something doesn't mean the rest of us don't either. Not to mention your perception of what impressive is holds literally 0 clout in anything. Your opinion doesn't matter to the rest of us who are interested in this.
---
Yeah i suppose. There are some benefits to a higher population. But that also means that, perhaps, if I was a crafter, I’d have twice the people competing with my sales. So it would make professions even less valuable, potentially m.
---
Really good point. And here's the other thing about vanilla: the content delineations are much fuzzier. There's no "queue for x, queue for y". You might be questing in Tanaris, decide to do Zul'Farrak, and spend 20 minutes world pvping at the entrance before you get in, all in the space of an hour. What do you spec for that kind of experience? 
---
Well, whatever you like, and there are tradeoffs in every case. If you specialize, you get the exciting contrast of fish-out-of-water versus in-your-element, and if you generalize you get the pleasure of being pretty OK at all of them.
---
The oil in question is said to lend a warm, tingly feeling to highten the experience.
---
What was nice in vanilla was that nobody could really know another ones spec, unless checking for certain spells of course. Back then if a healer was needed for some dungeon or raid, you could join as druid with a half feral half rest spec and people wouldn't know the difference. Not sure how that will be this time around.
---
This is the most important aspect.  Without progressive itemization you get people just signing in for raids or not playing all together.
---
Got it, thanks for the details. All my healing experience was thank healing in wrath and some mist weaver stuff, so shaman is new to me.
---
Fetal Druid sounds fun. 
---
Hehe for sure
---
Expect a bunch of WoW veterans coming out of retirement recalling their memories onto world chat like anyone gives a damn
---
This is perfect
---
Ahh ok that makes sense. The Death coil is a horror effect, so I dont think WotF can break it.
---
The troll priest in devout - that's classic right there. The huge boost in power when you went from terrible non-bis blues to epics... ooooo that was nice.
---
Actually I’d be quite happy with those times as well
---
Ackchyally: for Sulfuron Hammer any BS would be sufficient, no Hammersmith required, so it was a bit less hard. However, the recipe itself required Ingot, so it was usually omitted.
---
Besides, that BS had to be really reliable, so I know that some people just leveled BS to 300 in order not to lose all those mats to a stranger should the guild BS denied to buy the recipe for the reasons whatsoever.
---
Are all of the trash pulls aoe?
---
Except that shield probably has a ton of Fire Resist on it. I'd be willing to bet he has a lot better gear than that for normal encounters.
---
There was a website called Wowcensus from like 2005-2007 that had this information readily available. You can access it on the Wayback Machine, but it's limited. 
---
One of the things I miss most is in WotLK era, being an elemental mage with frostfire bolt. It wasn't like the best thing. But I still got to raid and I my character was something I put together.
---
i mean there is always going to be optimal specs, but atleast with this you had the option to play something creative that might be particular to your playstyle which is cool and should be expanded apon with the current game instead of the crap they have now.
---
I honestly don't think there's a way for us to grok one another without sitting down in a room together. The terminology you use and the value system you show through how you frame things screams "optimization is the point of the game". You are definitely a min-maxer.
---
&gt; I’m intensely interested in exploring suboptimal builds and trying to make them function properly. 
---
And by "properly" you mean performant according to which metrics? A non-min-maxer might play a "suboptimal" build just because she's built a complex narrative about her character and the kinds of training and experiences it has had in its past.
---
&gt; the behaviors that seem at first glance to be joyful exploration of “what sounds cool” are better explained by a lack of access to data
---
Something sounding cool isn't a mechanical misunderstanding. It's... what the words mean. Maximizing the underlying mechanics through examining data is literally *not a consideration* for the Timmy archetype I outline above. 
---
&gt; This idea that it’s fun to pick talents that don’t synergize, but because they’re “cool”, betrays an ignorance about how Vanilla actually works.
---
Works for you, because synergy is something you care about, and reflects a mental model you have, as opposed to "You're telling me I get more crits? For more damage? With my giant axe? Hell yeah!" This is *actually* how lots of people think. I know it sounds implausible because you only have your brain as a reference. This is a perspective limitation all humans suffer from.
---
&gt; While the freedom to fail is an important part of game design, don’t confuse it with experimentation
---
You are free to define experimentation as simultaneous A-B testing, but it's going to lead to lots of talking past one another. Messing around leisurely with one thing for a month, seeing how it feels, and then trying another thing the next month, and making fuzzy decisions based on unscientific messing around is absolutely experimentation. It may not meet your rigorous scientific standards, but this is what I'm trying to communicate: Timmy isn't a scientist! Timmy thinks differently to you!
---
Wasn't added until 1.4, and even then, it was a fairly rare book that most guilds kept for themselves.
---
He's gonna be casting a lot of Arcane Intellect.
---
You claim that "Questing isn't the fastest. Even less for new players." This is directly contradicted by the fastest leveler in vanilla wow.
---
So did Gordax tank that?
---
Lots of people use netdecks in hearthstone, I don’t though. I love trying to beat the netdecks. That’s what gives me kicks.
---
Removing talent trees, to someone like me, was eliminating the part of the game I found most fun. It was like removing the ability to make your own decks in hearthstone. Now all you have is a list of five ready made decks... that’s how wows current system feels to me.
---
But he's saying he doesn't care about axes.
---
Shatter
---
tHe gAmE iS dEaD 
---
Yes. I'm not sure why you find that so unthinkable.
---
I've never played any other Warcraft games, so the lore didn't (and still doesn't) hold and great appeal to me. The storylines and characterization seem fairly tepid and uninspiring.
---
I've been playing MUDs since the '80s, so it certainly wasn't accessibility that drew me in.
---
And I'd argue that the graphics, and more importantly visual design, have never been anything to write home about. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, but it's nothing impressive.
---
What _is_ engaging for me is complex optimization puzzles. So playing with all the permutations of optimizations across every different class, for every different situation and playstyle, is fascinating and fun. (And that last part is one of the main things that the "everyone just uses the same build that's the best" people miss; there isn't a best build for every circumstance. Believing that there is one true build only holds, at most, if you're only ever doing exactly one thing.)
---
And I agree with you that the talent trees could have been _more_ complex and I would have enjoyed it more. The thing I spent a ton of time playing before WoW was Diablo II, and once again not because I gave a shit about its story or graphics, but because of the complex character ability customization options. And among the reasons that I liked BC and Wrath more than Vanilla, because the trees were deeper, and in one case also augmented by glyphs.
---
And that was also why WoW lost me with MoP. Six choices between nearly interchangeable options, that you can un-choose at a moment's notice, is _not_ fun or interesting.
---
Ridiculous that some videos say to do this lol
---
And in return we get to play the coolest caster class and get to TP and sell portals &gt;:D
---
&gt; You are free to define experimentation as simultaneous A-B testing, but it's going to lead to lots of talking past one another. Messing around leisurely with one thing for a month, seeing how it feels, and then trying another thing the next month, and making fuzzy decisions based on unscientific messing around is absolutely experimentation. It may not meet your rigorous scientific standards, but this is what I'm trying to communicate: Timmy isn't a scientist! Timmy thinks differently to you!
---
This makes sense. I sometimes forget that even with Wowhead and data-mining and fifteen years of theorycrafting there certainly will be players who either don't know how to access that stuff or don't care and are going to just rough it.
---
I mean you'll still have the option to play with your communities that you play with now. Not much will change playing on a blizzard server other than more people that are skeptical of private servers will pay to play classic and Bnet integration i guess? 
---
One hundred percent. I was always trying new combos in different situations. Tweaking a point here or there, or outright ignoring the max talent in one tree to allow me to get that cool secondary talent in another tree.
---
This is the part of the game I honestly miss most. By far. 
---
And the best was when the talents got upgraded for new expansions, and you got to start concocting a new awesome build all over again from scratch.
---
&gt; My point still stands though, the specs you listed excel in PvP and are suboptimal in other areas of the game.
---
You may be missing that _every_ spec that is good for any thing is bad at some other things. The people screaming that there's one true "cookie cutter" spec always seem to overlook that there is more than one thing to do in the game.
---
On alliance you're lucky as there's a case to be made for any. Human is best pve for sword spec, gnome escape artist is powerful in PvP vs. mages etc, and dwarf is a strong anti-rogue counter (stoneform breaks blind). And then NE has the least going for it but highest base agi and harder to see in stealth, so you can justify it.
---
So all in all you can do any :)
---
I remember unlocking ruin, had already filled SM. It was like wow, actually get to play my class now, wowee.
---
That’s it. Watched the movie when it came out but yeah
---
Haha I envy you! Gnome racial is so good for warrior pvp that I almost feel forced but I don't want to be a gnome because it doesn't "feel" warriorish to me.
---
It's almost too good not to.
---
you seem like the perfect type of person to use /spit on
---
Wasn't it 50%? Was it only 30% by 1.12?
---
Frostbolt and summon water.
---
&gt;I fucking hate pop culture making its way into games.
---
...uhh, have you played WoW? The "Link"in quest and Donkey Kong jokes in Ungoro crater, the Raiders of the Lost Ark sequence in Uldaman, the marijuana song that trolls sing, the deadmines is a reference to Goonies...
---
Wait, here we go. Here's a list:
---
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_pop_culture_references_in_Warcraft/WoW
---
That's just vanilla. It's like 50 pages of references.
---
Yeah, modern WoW is bad in a lot of ways, but this is one thing that actually _is_ the way vanilla was.
---
This post is an aboslute lie though. There is 1 build with maybe 2-3 flex points for every spec if you're lucky. The current day wow talent system that allows for respecing on the fly actually lends to more freedom than the old one.
---
I like the old talents but I'm not about to gaslight myself into believing there was ever a single choice.
---
No, this is a myth - the tooltip is wrong and has always been wrong. In vanilla, even in 1.12, it ALWAYS gave 1 rage per 3 seconds in combat. 
---
Anger management is one of the best single point talents ANY warrior could take in any spec. That one point was, on average, providing similar rage gain IN COMBAT than ALL FIVE points in Unbridled Wrath in Fury.
---
It’s socially enforced in every game but this should not be a reason to remove the choices as not everyone is an ass. I see this argument as pandering to the hectoring shit in my EOTS lobby, fresh from watching the best hero list for that month on YouTube, who is spamming me in caps to pick a different character from the one I want to play, and am very good at.
---
It’s like a wilful ignoring of the fact that there are many different priorities and interests in game, and for some, experimenting with wide ranges of choices is the game to them. I like trying different things and like even more when my carefully crafted but unusual build serves your cookie cutter brainless build in a duel or pvp, or in the dps meters.
---
Like in many other ways, blizzard has consistently pandered to the “everything needs to be easy for me” crowd and this is why the game sucks. Everything is handed to you on a fucking plate. From builds, to gear, to levelling, to quest markers, to talents, to easy mode raiding, to trAvelling in game. The game is built to make everything easy now. And it’s boring. Death from a thousand cuts.
---
So for the sake of clarity, You believe changes can be made in a vacuum and then not be used as a reference point for future changes?
---
As for your examples youre refering to content patches, which like i Said above means they have all values ready to tune. You can change core classes, but you can also change boss mechanics, loot table,add new spell ranks through books,give more or less powerful det bonuses and on it goes.
---
Balance changes in a static enviornment would be much more akin to hotfixes, which we have 15 years of presedence saying is generally  a bandaid at best and requires proper looking over in the next contentpatch. 
---
Huh. Well, if it's actually like that then yes, the shaman wins in the highest crit category as far as I know, if you just count one of the numbers in a single attack rather than all together.
---
30% in vanilla.
---
20% in TBC
---
People who feel the current gameplay is interesting have a pretty small crossover with the people the OP is aimed at. Balance is an entirely seperate issue as obviously they intended hybrids and pure dps to be separate in classic and somewhat in BC.
---
Personally I've never enjoyed any class or spec design since cataclysm for more than a patch or 2, so obviously anyone who feels similar won't want blizzard to attempt to fix anything.
---
Really loved elemental shaman in wotlk. Having lavaburst v really fleshed out the spec as a weilder of the elements
---
Wow. You really try to make it harder than necessary. You shouldn't have any mana issues on MC bosses outside of your mana gems and potentially a mana pot on Ragnaros. Other than that you just roll hard on every damage consumable and/or GFPP.
---
95% of the time you WILL be spamming frostbolt on bosses outside of decurse (yes include positioning here if you will) and sheep on Domo.
---
A spec with only 1/3 in frost channelling but 2/2 Arctic reach...
---
This is what they said:
---
&gt;  deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .
---
They have a GOAL and there are things they want to AVOID.
---
OBVIOUSLY they will have to deviat from the original when it is required but they want to AVOID it as much as possible. One thing they can and will avoid is to "open pandoras box" and start "balancing" classes etc.
---
You can just hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around, or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters! 
---
I just hope it's like the old days where nobody gave a fuck and just needed warm bodies 
---
Why would they even play Classic?
---
No I don't remember. Classic launch was a shitshow, and it was bug ridden all the way to the first xpac. Games have always been bugged or unpolished, some better than others. The difference is today games can be patched and bugs fixed. The straps on your rose tinted goggles are squeezing your head so tight, you can distinguish fact from fiction. 
---
I dont understand this ”pre-bis bullshit”, whats wrong with having fun in ubrs prior på MC?
---
I'm talking about game design here. The current version of wow is hundreds of times better in terms of combat mechanics. It's not debatable, it's not a matter of taste. There's no arguing that spamming frostbolt is better than frostbolt filler inbetween procs and CDs that actually change the way you play for a few seconds, on top of having to aim a ball of frost at the boss - which by the way means knowing where the boss is and where he will be in a few seconds. 
---
The second option is just better gameplay. Higher skill cap, too. There's a lot of things you can complain about in retail, but arguing that vanilla gameplay was better is just objectively, provably wrong. 
---
Thing about the old system the designers didn't like is that most people just used cookie cutter specs. Heck, I was in a guild that told me to follow the spec or I couldn't raid.
---
... But sometimes the cookie cutter spec was actually *wrong* - or unnecessary.
---
One of the reasons I liked the old talent trees is it allowed you to make mistakes, while *also* allowing you to tune things the way you wanted them. Nobody plays the same as everyone else, nor should they have to.
---
The only thing worse than being forced to only use cookie cutter specs is being forced to not be able to make any choices at all.
---
Fallout 76 is 300x worse 
---
do basically this but on those guys from bwl
---
Oh really? Cause i surely dont remember blasting through heroics in less than 10 minutes with a ret paladin tanking in BC,nor do i recall lfd, or fuckall Raid attunements, or the expansion boss constantly checking in with You to see how youve been, or phasing for that matter. I certainly dont remember gear score in BC.
---
I certainly do remember the start of cataclysm trying to recapture the BC feel particularily of heroics,and the wrath newcomers are the next xplicit
---
Don't worry about it, in later raids you get to spam fireball instead
---
Your iq must be lower than your vanilla character level. This problem isn’t something I’m creating, it exists because we are starting with 1.12.
---
Cool, I enjoy playing at least a few specs in vanilla, while I enjoy 0 on retail
---
Generally people on classic servers require you to have perfect pre-bis before even thinking of inviting you for MC.
---
they are like 99% blizzlike... as opposed to 80% of classic (hopefully not but thats what it seems like atm..)
---
But its better to just wait to be able to cast another frostbolt sooner since you will do more damage per point of threat.
---
99% with extreme optimism. Some talents were simply point dumps, spawn timers for most mobs were simply shat on, and player cap was drastically increased past what original Vanilla servers could handle back in the day. Ive played on plenty of Vanilla pservers, mostly Nost and LH, and they were not even close to 99% blizzlike. 
---
I'm fairly certain that it does still give 1 rage every 3 secs and that it's just a terrible tool tip. 
---
I prefer clearing a dungeon in 15-20 Min rather than spending 2 hours in there. I liked Gear Score. Don't know whats the fuzz about it. Probably people dont like it cause they are casuals and have shit gear so people don't invite them in the first place. Gear score is just to save time. In good raids during wotlk, you still got inspected despite your GS. Difference is, if your gs was low as shit, they just didnt invite you in the first place to not waste time. 
---
That's because private servers have more content available to them than retail did.
---
 
---
Why do so many people on this sub answer questions they have no idea about. 
---
actually no it isn't.
---
Looking back at old screens and old guild site posts - our MT tanked Nefarian in Fury/Arms spec because prot wasn't viable until later patches.
---
That's exactly what is being illustrated in the screenshot
---
&gt;Divine Strength
---
I thought it was awesome while levelling, but must admit I haven't tried without. Always had the ability maxed and I did play arms while levelling.
---
Yep. I used to be a mage that could cast arcane explosion, blizzard, fir ball, etc... and specialize in one of the trees. But now I'm not as good. I'm weaker and forced into a more boring streamlined experience. 
---
Ok I vaguely remember the name
---
&gt;Progressive itemization is a horrible idea: It adds nothing beneficial that isn't accomplished by rebalancing content
---
You're creating a problem by not having progressive itemisation, thicko.  
---
" while also drastically increasing the complexity of gearing up characters to casual players. " Vanilla is a complex game, get over it. Knowledge is power, and part of that knowledge is knowing what stats items will have in their respective patches and planning/gearing accordingly. Catering to the whiners and the casuals is what ended us up with BFA, LFR, LFD, all that good shit. In fact, why don't you go and play that right now because it's pretty obvious you don't want to play Vanilla if you want them to rebalance stuff.  
---
The big problem without progressive itemisation is that the items you get in dungeons will outperform items in the first 2.5 tiers of raid content. This is no joke, go and research it yourself because I'm not going to give you every stupid example of which there are countless. One that springs to mind is Savage gladiator chain which will last you until Naxx (if you're unlucky with Skeram drops). It's from a level 54 boss mob in BRD... BUT, this item wasn't upgraded to its 1.12 state until patch 1.10, before which it's useless for fury and bis for tanking. Whereas in classic it will be bis for fury warriors from the second the server goes live (assuming no progressive itemisation) - until either the Skeram chest from AQ40 (very rare) or the trashdrop Ghoul skin tunic (I think??) chest from Naxx.   
---
You might say my iq is low, but your skill in dumbfuckery sure is off the charts, bravo.   
---
&gt; our MT tanked Nefarian in Fury/Arms spec
---
That's because it was the best build available, which is exactly the entire point of my post. You had to use the 1 build available for the job.
---
big lie? I see players all the time. even before on nost.
---
Good for you.
---
Before I started reading guides I always did too. I was curious so I went to a private server and I’m currently level 41 and notice no difference without it.
---
I am playing more rage conscious than before which I believe substitutes the talent point
---
Imagine you're a warrior, gz you can get your chest that's BIS all the way until AQ40 from BRD. This is just one example, and there are many more, you regularly see the updated dungeon blues outperforming items from the first 2 tiers of raid content. It's a terrible idea to not have progressive itemisation.  
---
DM at launch isn't great, but nowhere near as impactful as the catch up blues/1.10-1.12 item updates.
---
you were in TR?  What was your char name?
---
That's just not true. 
---
Yes, when you play a rogue or warrior which is like 40% of the servers population this might happen.
---
I was approached by 3 different guilds to start healing/being their totem bot in their farm raid when I was a level 57 shaman. When I hit lvl 60, their T2 dualwield tank rushed me through 15min DM:N runs and equipped me with preRaid in about 4 hours.   
---
But even before that preRaid I already raided with them.
---
Classic private servers are the niche of the niche. Only the most hardcore players will be attracted to a private server for dedicated amounts of time. So I think it's natural that this hardcore mentality has taken over.
---
When Classic is released to the public, the playerbase is going to be huge. There will be options and people won't get to be the "gatekeepers" to content anymore since someone can always find a group.
---
I imagine they would purely because it will be huge on the viewer side of things.
---
I don't know if they'd get (or even try for) world first, or even raid at all - mostly because there are dedicated guilds who put time into vanilla and are already prepared - in terms of raids, which isn't just [lack of] raid mechanics, its reps, countless consumables, pre raid gear - and not to mention levelling too.
---
&gt;So, to answer your question, who **would** be better?
---
Method - if they cared and prepped. No question about it, top players who play at an actual skill level vs random people clearing content that was defeated 14 years ago, who just play long hours all day because they can doing the same thing. 
---
Who will actually win? Those random players, because I doubt Method players will be putting in time and holidays to play Vanilla launch instead of saving it for world firsts of the live game. 
---
Blizzard? To do all that work?
---
Can you rephrase your idea using “Random Number Generator”?
---
They will stick with retail but have also have a division for classic as well.
---
Well I did say it makes it easier didn't I. 
---
What are those trinkets you use? I know the ”Ephemeral Power” trinket from MC, and there’s another one from zg I think? What are your other trinket slot used for? Thx for the great info!
---
How2inflateeconomy.jpg
---
It's more about the deceptively small weapons variety for warriors. The Arms tree synchronizes better with axe spec than any other weapon type, and with Mortal Strikes, and all kinds of stuff linked to absolute weapon damage, slower weapons are preferable to fast ones. (Disregarding PvE tanking.)  
---
For example, in this case I'm all for Hashtag Making Changes: remake the talent tree so that it allows for more different kinds of weapons and playstyles. (Especially pole arms, the coolest weapons in the game.)
---
They will be don’t worry
---
Mortal strike is level 40. At same time as plate. Awesome! 
---
I enjoy them both, but for different reasons. Modern looks really smooth and colorful and oddly soft? And of course, the scenery as you mentioned looks really beautiful.
---
On the other hand, I absolutely adore the art style of vanilla. The sharper edges and the overall blockier look has a certain charm to it imo, reminds me of those old ps1 era graphics and has good feelings. I also think there are plenty of good landscapes in vanilla, made even better by the immersion factor.
---
I dunno if it's really fair to say vanilla looks awful or even worse than retail unless you're solely judging it based on polygon count and if so uh... fair I guess. 
---
The difference between you and me is that you want to play Vanilla because retail is bad. 
---
I want to play Vanilla because I love Vanilla.
---
By Sigmar! No execute? How do you even warrior?
---
Why is that so good for leveling? 
---
&gt; This post is an aboslute lie though
---
&gt; That's because it was the best build available, which is exactly the entire point of my post
---
Umm, then the point of the picture has gone completely over your head. LOL
---
I also must say that they ”classic community” seems extremly devided. 
---
One of the things that is brought up about WotLK is it being silly because you got invited to Naxx in quest-blue/greens and how ”hard” Vanilla was and yet the most upvoted comment is about doing MC in quest greens. 
---
Yeah :/
---
 /tickle all the way for me xD
---
I don't think the same can be said for classic though. Some classes maybe but if you want want to be 'the best' pve damage spec you are giving up a lot. Combat Dagger rogue compared to Swords was pretty fucking horrible at soloing. What if you want to pvp and raid on your Warrior? No one is spending 50g to respec all the time. They take a build that sits somewhere in the middle.
---
I always raided as combat swords because I knew combat daggers was garbage outside of raids. Even though daggers was more dps. There's no illusion of  choice there, that's an actual choice.
---
But that's the whole point. It was a real choice because it had consequences. You had to decide 'do I want Imp Hamstring because its amazing for pvp, even though its garbage for raids?'. 
---
Would there be any particular advantage to having FA at 300 before you start farming runecloth?
---
for most classes it boils down to 2-3 cookie cutters anyways.  
---
I still prefer the ability to change my spec slightly.
---
you can build specs that work very well in PvE aswell as PvP with only a couple points not spent optimally for either.  
---
fire mage with imp CS for example.  
---
fury warrior with more PvP focussed build.  
---
heal druid with a spec suited for FCing.  
---
a combat rogue with imp kick, idk. you get the idea
---
GearScore incentivized all players to spend their hard earned Emblems of Frost on that piece of shit Skeleton key with stamina and absorb shield simply to proper inflate their GS, rather than pick up a piece that would serve you a lot better.
---
GS was invented that people with fuckall game knowledge didn't know how to set up a group or how to tell a player was decent, so they got an addon that they trusted blindly instead, it's the epitome of why WoTLK was fucking atrocious.
---
Of course you're not going to agree with me, since by all accounts you're the very demographic that fucked WoW into its current state in the first place.
---
How about 930 til 1230 on weekdays. For us who are free while the kids are at school. 
---
as much as I enjoy talking to foreigner I am really excited about an all EU or even all german community.  
---
realistically these are the guys I ended up forming real friendships with. if you can't meet irl its just another online aquaintance imo.
---
/lick for undead chars does it for me in most situation
---
ice block no doubt.  
---
it has the largest impact for a single point.
---
As soon as youre able to make heavy runecloth, you should switch to those, since you'll be actually using them later on.
---
&gt; Is there a constructive and *unbiased* information
---
That particular part says you're looking for objectivity, rather than subjectivity.
---
What most people I talk to (Read: not most people, simply those in my sphere) agree on is that convenience's the reason WoW is like it is today. They made things easier over time in Classic and TBC as well, but it felt much more organic than in the WoTLK era and beyond. At that point it was all about making it as convenient as possible.
---
No more quests sending you all over the world, that's inconvenient, no more getting attunement and resistance gear, inconvenient. No reforging stats, inconvenient. No keeping multiple gear sets, inconvenient. No more manually forming groups, inconvenient. And on and on it goes.
---
At some point down the line all the convenience made WoW not a fantasy world you stepped into and explored at your leisure, it turned into a theme park ride with loads of flashy things happening all around you on the way, but you're very much set in the track and exploring the ride yourself is simply impossible.

I dont know how it was like in Vanilla, but i tried this several times in TBC. Once you deleted your character you should be able to create a new one with the same name. However once you did that, you will no longer be able to restore the deleted char since the char files are "overwritten" or something like that. Atleast thats what it was like in TBC. But i dont know whether the name is locked to your account or not.
---
I will definitely create some toons to save my names :D
---
Not going back to hammerfall. That's the only benefit really. 
---
&gt;Schematics you craft will stay orange 15 levels longer for you than everyone else.
---
I'm 99.9% certain this is false, do you have a source from classic? You simply start at level 15, so the first 15 levels are free. 
---
Lol what a bitch
---
I used a "sub optimal" spec as a rogue and was able to put out burst DPS higher than "BIS" and optimal spec. It didn't matter that it only lasted for less than a minute. By the time I was done, my pvp targets were dead. Not even the top tiered warriors could win in a duel. I simply had too much staying power with my custom, unique spec. 
---
I don't say this to brag, because I don't care if you are a rogue, lock, warrior whoever. Everyone is important to making this game work. Every class is fun and necessary imo. 
---
I use that story as a point of contention though. That ALL specs, are valid if you enjoy them and they work for your personal play style. 
---
I'm so over playing a game where we are all clones of each other and nothing is unique anymore. I'm sick of transmog. I want the shit tier gear to look like shit and the epic loot to look epic as it should. 
---
I want to struggle and work hard for everything I have. I don't want it handed to me. If it has to be handed to me, I don't deserve it. I want my sense of uniqueness back. 
---
Personally, I was a fan of the battlegroups from TBC (ie. there were crossrealm PvP, but only from a fixed group of servers). Maybe it was because I was in a small group, but I remember frankly knowing good pvpers from other realms. Even servers I recognized, like "oh these guys are from server XY so they are more likely to be good". That said, the "community" feeling was preserved, at least within the PvP community. If they decide on some sort of crossrealm PvP, I really hope it is not across all servers.
---
paladin is objectively the least “active” class to level, assuming you’re just pulling one and killing it, because it’s mostly autoattacks with seals and judgments in between. there’s just a lot of downtime. you could argue that mages or priests are similar in activity due to long cast times, but they often need to kite, which increases the difficulty and activity. 
---
but i wouldn’t say paladin is necessarily boring to level. if you really love pressing buttons as much as possible, then they aren’t what you’re looking for, for sure. but they’re nice and relaxed, with panic buttons allowing you to be a bit more daring in pulls, and you have the option to heal and tank dungeons as you level, rather than just dps. they also don’t have a whole lot of downtime, since they can heal themselves, and they don’t really slow down much if they’re trying to conserve mana, so chain pulling is easier. 
---
/moo
---
Just that, no others !
---
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
How’s Gordax?
---
There will be plenty of new content. I hear 8.1.5 is coming soon.
---
What? That's not new *Vanilla* content? Of course it is not. Classic is not a new separate game. It's a server option for WoW. It's part of WoW. WoW is getting new content. It'll not get *two different* new content patches.
---
It think people are delusional around here when they think that Classic WoW is it's separate game and will have separate development. It's population doesn't have to be "sustained". The servers will be there, people can hop on or hop off. Blizzard will not care.
---
If they are smart, they'll release TBC (separately) and WoTLK, and the rest. The Classic development group is perfect for that. It'll be a low effort (low development cost), high reward investment. A lot of people will play their favorite expansion (even derided expansions have their fans) and after the initial bring up they'll need low maintenance. Anything else is a pipe dream. Blizzard will not dedicate massive resources to try and placate a few bored Vanilla veterans.
---
Let me stress it again. WoW is being developed. If you want something from WoW, tell Blizzard, maybe they'll incorporate into the latest patch. (Now try to say that with a straight face. :) If that's how it works with the main product, see how well it'll work with the side project...)
---
That's also a good point. They could just do that. 
---
The difficulty of Vanilla was the inexperience of players and the lack of knowledge about encounters. There were no guides, no tutorials. And barely anyone knew how classes worked. Rotations were almost nonexistant and no one wore BiS gear. People were still experimenting. And some experiments failed; thus people nowadays believe it was particularly difficult. Then also the whole Naxx discussion about "barely anyone could clear it before TBC hit". Obviously, the raid was only available for a few months before TBC came out and no one cared anymore.
---
It all comes down to supply and demand.
---
There is no such thing as a "healing set", no lvl up items give you +healing, so you have to make do with your spells.
---
I feel like you can get up to razorfen kraul without any healing talents, but after that you at least need to increase your healing wave cast time.
---
It's hot, there's sweat everywhere, you sometimes fall over. Awful.
---
Pfft, my guild on a private server is clearing AQ with some members still wearing lvl 40-50 greens. We cleared MC with a guy who was lvl 58. We are progressing in Naxx with our 3rd tank still not having epic legs. 
---
People arent as hardcore as you think, not even on private servers, nor is the content itself very hardcore. 
---
That is incorrect as of Nostalrius. All private servers released 2015 and onwards have utilized progressive content patches and progressive itemization (in varying degree though).
---
To some extent that is true, but pre-knowledge of pre-raid bis will make it more of a requirement this time around.
---
Back in vanilla I (and probably most others) had no concept of pre-raid bis, I hadnt even heard the word.
---
To be honest I'll be glad to not play with Americans. They generally have a strange attitude compared to EU players. I think it's due to the national culture. EU countries typically have similar cultures but the USA is just so different and there is just this weird clash. 
---
Talent changes, new raids, races etc
---
I think warlock in this case.  Reign of fire is good, and Hellfire can be even stronger. Add the dots on top of that.  AoE I feel works great on AB clusters on flag, or flag room group in WSG, along with AV.  
---
That's precisely why I suggest opening up 1 other server after an allotted timeframe, then 1 more after another increment of time.
---
I really think that could work, because even if the team isn't from your server, it'd be from the same 1-2 other servers and I think it'd be easy to recognise names while still maintaining a server identity.
---
thanks for your input :)
---
I agree with this so many times over. I'm currently raiding on a private server (and has been for the past 7 years) and I've made so many friends from outside europe that I raid with on the regular. 
---
This, I would much prefer a slightly larger server pop, over cross realm anything. 
---
I get so frustrated when I meet someone and we get along and I think I made a new friend just to find out we're on different realms. Can't trade, can't /friend    it's a fucking joke. 
---
Godsmack is totally fine....
---
Great for twinks. Some recipes can't be used at 19 otherwise.
---
Well, ok I should've clarified. Those are just references, It's not the same as bringing in an actual selfie stick that was more or less invented the day before. I hate how you feel the presence of Blizzard in retail, they should move out of the way entirely and let the world be but they keep meddling and introducing shit that breaks immersion. One example is how you get extra bag space if you register an authenticator. Wtf, I don't want to be reminded of the real world when playing.
---
It's actually one of my mostly highly valued aspects of Vanilla. It was made for the non-hardcore nerds and not for the absolute mainstream.
---
ND had Dire Maul 1 month after launch.  So it was in the game before most launch players had even hit 60.
---
lol
---
Statistically it was roughly 51/49 distribution in vanilla. 51% Alliance. 
---
There will always be enough players at 8K cap to make each side weighted enough. 
---
&gt;most are old hardcore raiders that now have IRL obligations.
---
Not your average vanilla players then.
---
Most people who played during vanilla weren't hardcore raiders (or even reach level 60), definitely aren't in a guild 6 months before release,  and a good portion may not even be aware classic is happening or care.
---
Expecting any meaningful portion of the reported 7.5 million people who played back then to return is fantasy.
---
If you don't like what vanilla wow is going to be, then why don't you just avoid it entirely and continue playing retail? It sounds to me like you'd be happier. 
---
As did the European servers since WoW was released a 1-2 months after North America.
---
Your point?
---
Yep, frostbolt was pretty OP back in the day before a lot of classes had more mobility. 
---
"You spam frostbolts"
---
Modern talents let you choose more what tipe of war you wana be because they can ad spec reliant passives and abilities without braking the game with furry war having op tank abilities. And how the fuck can an affliction lock cast rain of fire rpg wise they work with soul curse not fukin caos that why you get a destruction lock
---
Yes, in raids. Raiding isnt the game though. 
---
Well on ND I was in a semi hard-core German guild we cleared MC 3 weeks after launch with about 20 60 and the rest 55+ so yeah preraid gear is for mc not needed the only important thing is that the my got a little bit gear and the ubrs shield is a plus 
---
Yea buddy. Welcome to the dark side.
---
&gt;There are cookie cutter specs in PvP, too.
---
Sure, but I never ran them.  In fact I didn't know anyone who ran a cookie cutter spec in Vanilla. TBC they did, but not Vanilla.  Wow was a game and trying to be optimized 100% for raids or PvP was only something the most hardcore did.  The rest of enjoyed doing both with our sub-optimal specs.
---
There is always the option to play on the English European servers (in case you are European) Because they will still host people from countries like NL or BE or other nations that don't have their own dedicated servers.
---
3 shift rotation here *sigh* My endgame will be getting all class' s to level 60
---
I used to get a small chub every time I'd pop Preparation. You knew someone was about to get the hate. 
---
&gt;Can they then delete a toon and remake it with the name but the hair/skin options they want? Or will that risk freeing up the name. 
---
Yes and yes.  I used to this, but I made sure to only re-create the toon in the middle of the night when few people were on to avoid losing the same.
---
However, this time I'm not going to screw around with that stuff.  I'm going to pick a short name I want to be called by and then put that at the start of every toon name.  I created way too many alts and I confused friends jumping from alt to alt who had very different names.
---
If you want to win BG's and PVP is important to you. Pick horde and make your brother happy. 
---
If you are just in it for the pve, then both sides are pretty much equal as well so horde won't hinder you. 
---
Horde definitely went into vanilla with the PVP advantage though. 
---
DM was released one month before ragnaros world first anyway. Most players had acces to it before even stepping inside mc
---
Once the servers go up, every name will be on a first come first serve basis. If you want a rare/popular name you need to be there when they go up and hope you're the first top get it.
---
Some people will take the names then never play the characters. 
---
If you delete the character the name frees up afaik, not sure if there's a grace period in WoW.
---
Likewise though, one skilled and geared rogue, and all of that is out the window. 
---
There will always be easy players to take advantage of, and bigger fish that out class you. 
---
I say pick the classes you'll both enjoy playing. 
---
For the horde!
---
UD Rogue had it in my guild, before we really knew what it was I think.  
---
We just used the dreaded DKP system and I guess he really wanted it..
---
For the thorns build?
---
Sorry wtf are you actually on about mate?
---
This picture is from Jan 05 - the game hadn't even launched in Europe.  Nothing about EU or Private servers changing what I said - that launch retail players had very little content/gear to grab before going into MC.
---
Someone pointed out that the warrior in the pic has the full dungeon set - so clearly we had been farming/prepping the only available gear to us before venturing into MC.
---
Although as illustrated by the fact that our raid had some people that werent' 60 then we were clearly impatient to get into MC.
---
But as mentioned - we didn't have anything else to do.  Nobody is going to run UBRS every night until DM/ZG is launched - which is another point you miss lol - nobody back then knew the upcoming content or patch timeline ffs.
---
&gt; Most players had acces to it before even stepping inside mc
---
This Lucifron kill is from January 05 mate, the game had been out two months by that point.
---
&gt; hunter/shaman
---
ORC. Hardiness: Chance to resist Stun effects increased by an additional 25%.
---
Command: Damage done by Hunter and Warlock pets increased by 5%.
---
If the entire playerbase was on one server that would be true, but when it's over hundreds of servers you naturally get outliers with significant imbalances, and people on those servers will not have a good experience.
---
I play on w server right now with a 55-45 imbalance and alliance have 20 minute bg queues. The bigger the imbalance the worse it gets 
---
Not really, only for the hardcore guilds. Most normal guilds, semi-hardcore or casual, will struggle enough to get 40 people to raid and will as a result take on people still wearing greens, people in weird specs and even people at lvl 58 or 59. This is the situation on private servers, and most likely in classic as well. 
---
21 Holy 30 Ret was almost the cookie cutter spec for ret.
---
With that build you can get every single Ret DPS talent (with the exception of not having 8 points in Prot for 3% but but you dont dual wield so should be able to meet hit cap from gear). It also gives you all the important stuff to heal, you just miss 5% passive spell crit and a few smaller talents like imp BoW and holy shock (not great) compared to a pure holy paladin.
---
21 Holy 30 Ret can heal raids absolutely fine, 95% as well as a pure holy paladin, then throw on warrior dps gear and do as much damage as a pure ret.
---
A whole 20 minutes?
---
That's more than acceptable. This is supposed to be vanilla after all. 
---
what kind of gear did your 60s have?
---
I'll take my time, i don't want to break record. I'll take it easy, work on my professions &amp; stuff, just having a good time is enough for me. I don't plan on using quest addons aswell
---
/fart :)
---
Nobody mentions the most important factor? Horde does not have gnomes!
---
«As far as Americans being sensitive. That is most likely true but, it's kinda hard not to be. When all of your allies start rewriting the last 50 years of your history to make you out to be the bad guy. If I get ranted at by one more European trying to say the US. is evil because we meddle in other peoples elections I am going to vomit.»
---
Funny because each time i say i am french, there will always be some american to do some white flag joke. And honestly i dont care.
---
My point is that this is on a server with a relatively minor imbalance. Ones with larger imbalances will naturally be worse. 
---
It effects the entire server though. The overpopulated faction are forced to gank constantly between bg queues to stay ahead on honour. The ignorant look back at this all dewy eyed thinking of world pvp, but it generally just leads to groups of rankers systematically farming high level flightpaths and questhubs all day every day, supressing the opposite faction even more and making the imbalance worse.
---
That sounds like a good plan! I'm a bit of an altaholic too and old guildies always asked be to prove I was who I said I was because my alts were all different names and styles.
---
I think the point with the old talent trees is that yes, cookie cutter builds do exist, but you have the option of playing different ROLES from the primary tree (you can tank as arms/fury, you can heal as Ret) because all classes had most tools available all the time. You never see that in modern WoW - a ret paladin CANNOT put on int gear and heal an instance. They swap to Holy.
---
In addition, there were a LOT of viable builds. Some dps classes, yes, had cookie cutter builds. Fury is probably the main example. But look at other Warrior specs. Arms had a PvP utility build, a pure PVE dps build (albeit not as good as fury) and the hybrid 31/5/15 build for raid tanking and pvp.
---
Protection warriors had about TEN viable builds. You could grab Impale and 3% crit and still have arguments about where at least 3 spare points go in the rest, you could hve 38 prot builds, you could have the 8 fury build for increased Demo Shout, you had options for variable amounts of Tactical Mastery depending on how much 5 man tanking you wanted to do.
---
Druids had Pure Resto, 30 feral 21 resto and Moonglow as three completely different but equally viable raid healing builds.
---
You're pretty much correct in what you're saying, but I think it's more nuanced than you may think. There were cookie cutter builds, but there were a LOT of options even with the minmaxed builds, and you still had little variances even then. 
---
You may not think there's that much difference between giving a warrior a choice beween 2/2 Imp Shield Bash for controlling casters in dungeons and pvping, vs a more solid 2/2 improved Shield Wall for better Oh Crap survivability, but such a thing WAS a choice that various builds gave you, and you could justify either choice based on situation and personal preference. It wasnt clear cut.
---
And whilst the prohibitive respec cost made experimenting awkward, you ended up with people TRYING to make versatile builds. In a world with Dual Spec, you'd NEVER see the 21 Holy 30 Ret spec, that could heal and dps, because the paladin would have a  Holy SPec and a Ret spec cookie cuttered out to the max. But for a player who hops between both, having another third spec option that let them do both at 95% efficiency is the key to why the old talent trees felt so nice.
---
Crowd pummler would still be better 
---
I used the MS + Last stand build, had a few points in fury as well but not as far to get that enrage thing or aoe slow shout.
---
This was after a couple of hundred days /played. I didn't theorycraft much, mostly went with what proved good in both PvE and PvP/farming. We cleared as far as AQ40 with me as MT so it wasn't that bad really.
---
Funnily enough I didn't use protection much, except to level (until 40ish iirc)! I was lagging a lot, which made me give up on my mage in the first place. Prot leveling was pretty safe, and honestly it didn't feel that slow at the time.
---
Can't decide on what healer to play. Are healers even going to be in demand? From private server spelunking I've gotten the impression that the only thing needed are tanks and DPS so I might be out of my element here?
---
Played holy paladin from WOTLK-&gt;Legion but had most fun in the beginning. I have no issues machinegunning flash of light but I never played holy paladin in vanilla so I'm not sure how much utility other than that is available (blessing of sacrifice, aura mastery etc was amazing in WOTLK). 
---
Then again since I'll be running around in cloth it might be just as good of an idea to go priest?
---
I kinda feel druid is off the table. Never really enjoyed them, tree form is stupid and I'm under the impression that they just aren't very good either in vanilla WoW.
---
Yeah, her story is that she has turned into a grumpy middle aged lady, with the same view on the horde as her father. To be honest it's a realistic and kinda refreshing character development from characters either becoming dead/irrelevant (Thrall/Cairne) or heroes (most alliance leaders).
---
2/2 Reach gets you out of Lucifrons curse range IIRC, and maybe some other spells.
---
As you said yourself, mana isn't a problem and the range outweighs the threat reduction, in terms of utility and positioning. Why weave in and out of range to dodge boss abilities when you can just stand and freecast?
---
One real benefit of it is that on Nostalrius core private servers, the damage you deal with deathray scales off your engineering skill.
---
Whether this is accurate or not we don't know, but if it were true it would certainly be a bonus.
---
Thunderfury for the main tank then off tanks.
---
For the other it doesnt matter, give it to someone that want it, deserve it and is willing to put the effort to make it.
---
Sulfuras is a pvp weapon, usualy ehance and rets want it sometimes warriors too.
---
Atiesh, who cares ? Progression is finished before someone get it anyway.
---
i dont like what they did with any of the alliance leaders. at least horde got thrall
---
especially varian wrynn death , i dont really follow lore but that felt like a pretty weak way to go.
---
Anduin wrynn, ive no shit watched this kid grow up from vanilla he should be the biggest badass in wow today. i again dont know the lore but thats the only character ive really watched in a game grow up over a real time period. 
---
that kid should be like hold my beer fucking shit up and a main part of the story
---
If my memory serves, it wasn't *really* viable until BT was farm status and beyond where you could use pure +int gems for a huge mana pool when the gear had 2-3 sockets and have a dedicated druid or two to give you innervate.
---
I'm going to try and convince my 2 English friends to play on US servers for Classic. EU servers can be listed as 'English' but get overtaken by players from another region. The language barrier can be a headache
---
How is this upvoted? You create more threat per dmg than frostbolt so why would you ever wand if we are just taking threat in account?
---
It has 0 thorns. 5 is greater than 0. 
---
You won't get anything that everyone agrees on. A majority vote in cases like this doesn't hold up too. So no. Keep it as it was. Flawed or not, it's what we know and love. 
---
5 is more than 0, your maths are impeccable 
---
&gt; The vast, vast majority of Classic players were intensely casual and probably picked talents based on nothing more than which sounded cool
---
That was 15 years ago. There was very few ressources at the time compared to nowadays and the playerbase mindset was very different.
---
In the modern WoW community you are absolutely flooded with guides from dozens of different websites and thousands of YouTube content creators all copying the same cookie-cutter builds. Classic is not even out yet and I've seen a hundred "which class to pick", "how to level fast", "how to make money" and "X class guide for Classic" videos.
---
There's a reason it's such a big trend and business to make guides for everything, in any game actually. Today's gamers consume a lot of this type of content and that's why I think it's pretty fair to assume a lot more people will "cheese" through Classic WoW this summer with top notch builds instead of messing around with random talents that *sound cool*. Even the most casual players around me, who still play retail to this day because it fits them, can't pick a class without looking up a build on Icy Veins.
---
/golfclap when i get ganked hard
---
I am a bit teared apart between rolling on a French server, where some people I know IRL might roll (but likely will find Classic too difficult), or roll on an English server. I simply always play with the game in English, and I think it might be weird to play in a different language than the others. How could I reference items, quests, creature names ?
---
All this pre-bis and consumables bullshit on private servers is laughable. We cleared MC early for EU and while DM was out by the time we got to Ragnaros everone pretty much just had their blue tier sets which are pretty much just blue versions of "of the eagle" and "of the monkey". Spellpower was non existant as was spellhit and mp5. Like 80% of the raid had PvP specs, rogues were stacking crit above all else, arms warriors dpsing and a bunch of other sub optimal stuff.
---
A lot of pservers are corrupt and don’t last too long, only few are stable 
---
Guyses wtf is guyses 
---
I’ve already got my list of names and the first thing I’m gonna do before even creating my main character is quickly make those chars. Only downside to this is that my main won’t be at the top of the list unless blizz allows you to move characters on the new client 
---
They are probably desperate for Karma
---
Good counterpoint. I'd argue that it depends on the class, but generally speaking you can have enough gold by 40-43 so depending on how frugal you are the extra 15-30 mins or so could be a close call.
---
It doesn’t even do anything does it?
---
If you were to skin from 1-300, get a skinning point every time you tried, and take only 1 second on average in time of extra time skinning the mob, assuming it takes 3 seconds to skin, that's still 4x300, 1200 seconds, 20 mins. In reality it'll be more than that.
---
Actually it does.  Have you ever commented on certain sub Reddit’s and then tried to comment again only to get a message saying you need to wait 9 minutes before typing again?  That’s your low Karma holding you back.   I think some sub Reddit’s also make you have to have a certain amount of karma before you can even post anything. 
---
That's... not the argument. I feel like I'm not explaining myself.
---
Nobody (at least I hope so) is arguing that you can't run a full PvE build with one or two talents switched because they're useful in PvP.
---
Players have been doing that for fifteen years. When we talk about those builds we *never* talk about them as PvP builds, or “hybrid” builds. They're exactly what they are: PvE builds. It's a cookie-cutter PvE build with Imp. Hamstring for when you casually PvP.
---
You're not going to be a hardcore PvPer by *just* taking Imp. Hamstring.
---
So no, not really. That's not *Choice* with a capital C. It's not the choice that people talk about when they repeat the meme that talent trees allowed you to experiment with unique builds.
---
Unless your definition of unique is so wide and vague that literally changing one talent makes a build “unique,” in which case I can't argue against that. I mean, sure. It's technically unique I guess.
---
&gt; Plus on bosses like Ragnaros going melee with a mana bar is a no no.
---
I mean by and large, the effort is appreciated though and seems to have been helpful.
---
Guys**
---
Just use cheetah for a couple more levels until you can afford it, nbd.
---
The weird clashes is what makes it good. 
---
It takes like max 20 seconds to pick right customization if you know what you want.  
---
I seriously doubt anyone is sitting there spamming the name they want all day in hopes they catch that 20~ second window.  
---
Not sure if its even gonna work like that.  
---
On live your name is secured for like 6 months I think.  
---
Mana bar people get a mechanic that explodes people around them. Healers and casters must keep the distance, while like ferals can't shapeshift to normal form. And there is limited space so it may be hard to fit even one melee shaman.
---
Sounds like the Shadow Priest rotation.
---
Mind flay, Mind flay, Mind flay, Mind flay.
---
Well, I was in a casual guild, so not sure if we had much knowledge of debuff limits so I also tossed VE &amp; SW:P.
---
By the time I'm home I won't be able to raid until 9:30pm Melbourne time, I'm also looking for a late night or WA or morning raid guild. Maybe we should start our own...
---
No thanks. I'd rather only be able to pvp in peak hours than that solution. Also, being able to pvp 24/7 means that the top ranks will become full of complete no-lifers.
---
Don't forget the fights where you spam decurse ;)
---
Many will give up. Many will suck. Don't worry about it.
---
Some of the NA players I've met in private servers are staying in my guild. Yes, raid times might be a bit screwed for them but in Vanilla not everyone plays for raid times. Being able to freely farm at 3-4 in the morning EU time when it's 8 PM for you is kind of awesome. 
---
Yep, I agree with everything you've said. :D
---
I guess I should always restate the point I'm arguing against.
---
I would never argue that you can't run a full PvE build with one or two talents switched because they're useful in PvP. Many guides actually point out when that option exists—for example, to effectively WPvP while leveling.
---
Maybe it's a semantic argument but to me they are what they are: Cookie-cutter PvE builds with the option of taking Imp. Hamstring for casual PvP, for example.
---
Or like you said, picking Imp. Shield Bash vs. Shield Wall. Taking Imp. Shield Bash isn't going to turn a PvE Protection Warrior build into a PvP build, and I'd still refer to it as a cookie-cutter build.
---
So to me that's not Choice with a capital C. It's not the choice that people talk about when they repeat the meme that talent trees allowed you to experiment with all these varieties of unique builds.
---
Unless someone's definition of unique is so literal that changing one talent makes a build “unique,” you feel me?
---
Thanks mate good post. Just so I'm understanding, missing 5 % spell crit doesn't hurt you too much? It seems a lot at first glance.
---
It was like this until the Kazzak video went viral and blizzard nerfed it to a max of 5(I think) attacks
---
You know what I won't miss? Chinese gold farmers doing whatever they want because the server owners get kick backs. I won't miss GMs and server owners selling gold, unbans and items. I won't miss server owners using donations specifically donated to server costs being used for holidays. I won't miss the circlejerking and I wont miss anyone that is idiotic enough to play any server that came after Nost.
---
I highly suggest checking out [Rift's Talent creator](https://rift.magelo.com/en/soultree) in case you ever wanted too see how cool a talent tree could have gotten if Blizzard would have kept going with it.
---
Rift might be a mediocre WoW clone, but man is their talent system fun to play around with.
---
Passion creates project? 95% of all private servers ever created were done so for profit.
---
It’s just a sensationalist article filled with already known information. Nothing here is going to effect classic 
---
I wanna know how Gordax did! Dont leave us. hanging. 
---
The horde ony attunement is considerably longer than the alliance one. And you have to find patrolling rexxar in desolace like 3 or 4 times. 
---
I have a couple of things now that i didnt had in 2004: Debt, Depression and Erectile Dysfunction.
---
&gt; Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
Hey, that's my motto
---
Lucifrons curse range should be 40 yards, where 2/2 arctic reach gets you to 36 yards. 
---
Imo the threat reduction combined with the lower mana costs is awesome for when things go wrong. Sure a little more range can be handy, but imo not needed. Anyways, I would end of with 1 point in Arctic Reach, 3 points in Frost Channelling and skipping the coldsnap when going AP build. It can all depend on your guild though.
---
Even then, the ption is there for people who don't want to min-max.
---
You don't have that option on retail.
---
Warriors were also hybrids, ones that pretty definitively disproved the hybrid-tax contention. 
---
Not really! Remember that Spell Crit comes from Intellect as well as flat bonuses on gear, plus I believe a 5% base.
---
I'm not sure what the values are but I'd wager Paladins in good gear would easily be hitting 20-25% spell crit. A ret in the same gear might be hitting 15-20%. The difference might be a bit more noticeable in pre-raid Blues but as your healer gear improves the gap closes. And 5% is still 5% - it's 1/20th. In 20 casts of Flash of Light, a pure Holy will get 1 crit more than a ret/holy. 
---
Now obviously that seems a reasonable amount but consider you have Divine Favor to guarantee 100% crit on a spell when you need it, usually used on a huge Holy Light, and it isnt really significant. Flash of LIght is so cheap that even without illumination at all you can spam it for ages, particularly if you get lots of +healing gear and use a downranked version.
---
&gt; You could be effective in your role, or not. That's how binary the original talent system was.
---
Yes, but if you are not a min-maxer, you have the CHOICE of not being effective in favor of having more fun.
---
Let the cookie-cutter specs exist, and let people have the option of not following those (and maybe not being invited to raids, but even then, choice is the keyword here)
---
Does Sweden count as Eastern EU now? :thinking:
---
lol, Blizzard has stopped publishing their sub numbers since 2015. Any sources that claim to have any subscriber numbers should be viewed with caution because ActivisionBlizzard will not confirm any.
---
So whatever number you found is probably not reliable.
---
I wanna play vanillaaaaaaaaaaa. That's all.
---
You can play both games
---
Rotations are a fad anyways. The game isn't particularly more engaging when you're playing glorified Simon Says with a handful of spells. 
---
i'm not talking about the proc chance, i'm talking about how atk power scales into damage.
---
14 attack power = 1 weapon dps. so if you have a 3.5 speed weapon that's 3.5 points of damage per swing, and as it is an instant attack then it is higher bonus value than 1second dps baseline.
---
You are wrong.
---
/u/OrangeKefka is right
---
What? No!
---
Some TBC servers even give more stuff to Alliance (like increased leveling, dual talents) to see if they can make someone roll that faction.
---
Yeah I think we're arguing Semantics at this point.
---
To me having a Protection build that allowed 2-3 points to be swapped around for personal choice is significant, because whilst it may seem tiny, that 2-3 points IS a CHOICE. I choose my class and role, I then look at talents, I take the "obvious" talents, such as 1 in imp Shield Block, Shield Slam, 5/5 toughness, 5/5 defiance... ones you cant really argue against taking. But I still have a choice to make with the ones which ARE situational, and that choice is important.
---
When you couple those little small choices you get on the more obvious builds, with the POTENTIAL to at least have really weird hybriddy builds, and the fact that you have all your tools for all your roles in all specs, this adds up to a very engaging talent system that you can fiddle with a lot.
---
Druids were the best example with having three very very different cookie cutter healing builds. That's still a choice, and is two more than retail wow offers.
---
Heck, there's also the really obscure things. You can easily create things like "rogue tanking builds" with maxed out dodge/parry/agility and use weird feral items and bring a paladin healer with Salvation for everyone else and Kings for the rogue tank and voila, something weird and... well, not viable, but "useable". Is it a good idea? No. But it was possible.
---
Also it's been talked about in the past, but psychologically there's a lot to be said for having "must haves" and "trap talents". Sure, it may not seem very interesting when you put 1 point in Cruelty for that 1% crit as you level. But you know when you put it in that you're doing something right. The option is there to dump it in something else, but you know from Maths and reaffirmations from others that it's a good idea to get that 1% crit and that gives you a tiny buzz that you're "on the right track"
---
But your judgement is completely off  
---
They are not emo in any way.  
---
You sound pathetic lmao  
---
&gt; Move budget where? Classic is Classic, is Classic. Why move unnecessary budget into a completed game?
---
Are you serious? If Classic outperforms BfA then ActivisionBlizzard will definitely work on Classic to capitalize on the success and keep people playing. Because if they don't, a lot of players will probably leave after a certain time because they ran out of content. Whether there will be a Classic+ or a re-release of TBC is up for speculation, but they will need to move more budget to that new project that stems from Classic.
---
Well, now you can talk to other Europeans while freezing your balls off together. :P
---
Yes Warriors are OP so they will be heavily played but statistically so many will quit during the leveling process that there will be as many Mages/Rogues at 60.
---
Makes sense, nice. I might be considering pally now instead of warlock!
---
You're thinking of Rajface.  He was the GM of Unfadeable.  I was a founding member of that guild, but ended up leaving to create Capital.
---
Obtaining even one extra alt up to 35 just to make gold off of it is quite a time investment, not to mention the cost of leveling up alchemy. It will take a long time to have the gold/hr of a transmute alt pass the gold/hr of just about any other gold farming method. If you intend to play the alt for more than just crafting then it is worth it to put professions on the alt that have crafting cooldowns however it is probably not going to be worth it to make alts for the sole purpose of using crafting cooldowns.
---
Sorry what?  No I wasn't.  I'm pretty sure most Horde guilds had more than one Shaman lol
---
those 3 things can be fixed by classic? :P
---
Explain to me how reverse engineered data by any private server should be more accurate than actual backup of 1.12.1 wow data. 
---
It's correct it doesn't do much at max level, but it makes the levelling a multitude cheaper as you can keep using the cheaper recipes (gunpowders) to level, skipping over the expensive ones.
---
My point was that there was plenty of non-utilized pre-raid gear that people skipped on and instead used non-optimal items.
---
Also, no reason for the *wtf's* and *ffs's*
---
&gt; problem
---
Fresh
---
The main reason to take it is for situations when rage generating becomes tricky. Rooted by a frost mage? That rage will keep ticking up for a while. Someone pulls a boss and puts the raid in combat? You'll have more rage when it arrives for an opener. Onyxia flies up and pelts the raid with fireballs? You have 100 rage when she lands.
---
You can certainly play rage conscious but it doesnt defeat the point that that talent gives you 1 rage per 3 seconds. That's a lot more than many other talents. Do you have 5 points in Unbridled Wrath? 1 point in AM gives more rage than those entire 5 points. It's just maths at this point.
---
At the end of the day, having a better weapon and not missing makes the most impact in your rage, but there's so many talents that improve rage generation and if you take ANY of them but ignore Anger Management then there's just something wrong.
---
Mmm yeah right.
---
You could be Fire Mage in Naxx because bosses were immune to frost dmg. Or a Frost mage in MC and BWL because bosses were immune to Fire dmg. Arcane? You cast one Arcane Missiles and you have zero mana, lol.
---
You could be a Holy Paladin or you will not raid, unless you are high ranking member of a Naxx raiding guild that might play Retribution when the content is on farming (easy lol). Tank? Prepare for some fun when someone aggros your mob/boss and you don't have any Taunt ability.
---
You could be a Shadow Bolt spamming Warlock because Affliction or Demonology dps is shit.
---
You could be a Resto Druid or you would not raid, unless you want to be an off-tank when the off-tank Warrior is offline.
---
You could be a Holy Priest or you would not raid, unless you had enough luck to get the loot that usually is given to Locks and Mages, to then be the only SP with infinite aggro generation, no mana and shit dps. But mhu debuff for Warlocks!11!1!
---
You could be what you want, but only if its one of the prefixed Vanilla roles since 2004 ;)
---
Hey man that's cool as hell. I wonder how many people end up doing something similar :) Kudos I love the idea. 
---
Frost mage: "what is my purpose?"
---
Raid leader: "you spam frostbolt"
---
Frost mage: "oh my god"
---
you're using Private Servers (lol) and the EU release of the game to support your argument, when in a conversation about progression and gear the only timeline that matters is the US launch.
---
I'll say it again, competitive players who started in November 04 were 60 in December and in MC by January.
---
There was no DM or ZG to supplement the BRS/Strat/Scholo gear.
---
Not continuing this anymore,  I will block you on your next reply.
---
Ah, my bad then.
---
Make 2 characters! Im sort of in the same boat as I will be guilding up with a bunch of RL mates, but im gonna run a horde alt on the side :) 
---
Wen I remember our my had all most all preraid bis items and one mate aswell the rest was half blue half green. I was 58 all green with some low lvl blues.
---
Took us about 4h to clear with only one wipe cuz a failpull. Could have been faster if more people had the water^^
---
Amen brother, you will be missed :(
---
To be fair, I don't think we are THAT different on a deeper level once you get to interact with people properly, at least not from my experience ^^ Im EU as well. 
---
True, IRL meetups is something Ive not done since the old Retail TBC times. Didn't consider this one at all tbh. Good shout
---
Hah, Ill take your word for it, but it sounds entirely plausible :D Cant honestly say ive herded either but both sounds like a right pain. 
---
No one mentioned it so far so Shadow Form - Priest, beyond the unique extremely cool look it gives you it increases damage by 15% and reduces damage by 15%, totally insane.
---
I read another thread about this, lets say it takes 2 days /played to 35. I can Save a few hours. Anyway lets say i invest 200g to get alchemy to 275. My Profit per transmute is 10g. 70g a week which will be 140g a week and 210 etc. The more chars the quicker ill get back my 200g investment and ill get money from literally spending 5 min ingame and worry about Other stuff. Thats my reasoning. I Will play my alts aswell eventually
---
You don't remember because you must be 12. Games ship in literal unplayable shape these days. Vanilla and TBC, while flawed, had dedicated internal QA testers. The polish on those releases far exceeded what we see now.
---
Alchemy is a lot cheaper than 200 get if you focus on crafting useful stuff instead of following guides. For example blackmouth oil and free action potions are either free skill points or potentially even profitable. Same for a lot of other stuff like elixirs of fortitude or stonescale-&gt;superior armor.
---
I managed to hit 300 FA purely through mageweave the other day, but this was on a private server so values may be off honestly. 
---
So much this.
---
People approach server faction imbalance and long queues with a "shit happens, deal with it" attitude without realising the consequences it has.
---
I always saw it as hassling the other sides reinforcements. Just like in an RTS, hassle to slow the enemy team. If my guys have all the farm, and your side can't make experience, my team wins.
---
An armed, aggressive civilian.   Don't forget that part.  Players are actively apart of the war, not civilians. Drawing imaginary lines in war. 
---
Can you use several transmute once per day or just one? You can transmute water to shadow or if it was the reverse and IIRC cured leather hide (maybe it was rugged) is also sought after? What is the profit usually? 5g? Sorry I never was in the transmuting business on other servers
---
Don't forget shamans!
---
You could be a Resto Shaman or you would not raid, period.
---
It is a fine money making method if you don't mind spending all your time now to save time in the future. If you are efficient enough to level to 35 in about 48 hours to make 70g per week (after a 200g alchemy leveling) then comparing to a conservative 40g per hour for a mage in dme it would take just over 30 weeks to surpass the 40g per hour (this is counting the daily transmute login as negligible). If this sounds good to you then I'd recommend taking another crafting profession with a cooldown (like Tailoring/Mooncloth) to further increase profits. 
---
But it was for the guilds that actually wanted to progress raiding.
---
Oh no, don't go slowing the enemy team down!  Pat them on the back.
---
Warriors have cheetah?
---
15 btw
---
I'm not so sure, I am SUPER excited for classic but I was talking to a friend the other day about it ( a guy who also played vanilla-wotlk). I asked him are you excited for classic, and he said "nah not really" in a monotone manner and went on to talk about how he had fond memories but he didn't want to relive the past. Another friend who was a diehard fan back in the day basically said he wasn't into it because of the sub cost.
---
Now I'm not saying it won't do well, just saying we should probably temper our expectations just in case this isn't the WoW renaissance we hope it is.
---
Your logic is incorrect. OP could have chosen better source, sure. But whether the information has been known or is new doesn't matter, it can very much effect classic regardless of how some article on the internet represents it.
---
No. 
---
If anything, it would benefit because Blizz would really try not to screw this one up
---
By the way why is Goldshire is the center of all this stuff? Why not some of the Inns in the Stormwind?
---
lol yea because most guilds didn't want to progress...
---
Tons of guilds cleared a large portion of Vanilla content, the top guilds that cleared ALL the content might have been this strict, but the majority of guilds (most of which made decent progress throughout Vanilla), did not in fact mandate and bench players for not having specific talent points.
---
I level a Warrior on a Pserver and I need to say leveling arms was the best decision ever. Leveling trough stranglethorn while being able to solo lvl 40 Alliances..
---
 No comparison to this Wow Bs they call today
---
While that is true, not leveling alts with tranmuste wouldn't net me any money at all. Also wont the gold per/week be additive? More characters will make more gold thus reducing the time it will take to regain the gold on the new character. Or am I just thinking wrong in terms of math? I can spend the gold to invest in more transmute Alts is what I try to say I think (sorry I have a hard time keeping it short in english)
---
&gt; IIRC cured leather hide (maybe it was rugged) is also sought after?
---
Cured rugged hide is used in high end LW recipes eg Hide of Wild.  
---
You can make the salt for the hide once every 3 days, price today on ND is roughly 20-25g per salt/hide
---
Thank you for clarifying that you have zero grasp of the game. ZG itself is a catch up mechanic before the introduction of the blues in the naxx patch. So is AQ 20.  
---
But Blues released in 1.11 are a problem?  
---
You also don't seem to understand the idea behind catch up mechanics.  
---
The amount of stupidity in this thread baffles me.
---
After having so much fun on NW I've been considering this too, its been really nice to play with people all over the world.. Also; there is something special about a product or experience entirely constructed by an autonomous community. I don't know how atlantiss makes their money but we can fairly say the developers and admins make less than Actiblizz. It feels like a labor of love, especially during launch with all the bugs that had the developers up all week to correct. I've also realized the creators are not the same company we knew then; actiblizzard did not exist in 2009 or something. Just remaining cautiously optimistic about how it's going to be monetized... I think all these things worked together to make a different atmosphere. Lets see what happens!
---
But I think I get it, they have to pay for themself before they can pay for others. Thank you. Imo it's better than spending 5 days lvling a mage just to farm in a dungeon 5-6hours a week. So I guess a value the profit overtime
---
I do enjoy playing w some of the Euros. Dont love the 80+ ping tho even tho that’s being picky
---
**Epoch of Thought [H] **| NA-PvP | Tue, Wed, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devourer classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes, attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Tue, Wed, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; specifically seeking: Shamans, Rogues &amp; Warlocks. Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message, but the less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.shivtr.com&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt; 
---
**Join us!**
---
An armed, not aggressive child soldier more like.  
---
If someone is aggressive of course you have to deal with them, but most are not in the presence of higher level.  
---
They get shit on because they were dominant forces in their area, fucking it up for everyone.  
---
If they make it so servers can hold more people (and thus creating less servers) then they won't need to do CRBG at all   
---
Xrealm BGs shouldn't become a thing until after Naxx has already been released. If they do it earlier, it will skew the pvp scene drastically. It's one of those things that would really hurt the game if we had it from the get-go - sure, faster queues are nice, but the cost is too great. It's vanilla, but it was only vanilla from late august to early december 2006, it's not the vanilla experience (we saw our first 60s, the onyxia, ragnaros, nefarian, c'thun and most of naxx downed before xrealm BGs), and the vanilla experience is what we were promised.  
---
    
---
It should come a while after naxx release and be the "final" content rollout of classic servers, or \_not at all\_
---
This is a problem Blizzard may have to address, that one class is the only viable endgame tank and also the best endgame DPS and also the dominant PvP class and everyone knows it.
---
This is a problem that results from the eternal 1.12 of pirate servers. In retail vanilla warriors weren't even theoretically dominant as DPS until maybe 1.11, and really as a hybrid in plate they ought to be doing significantly less damage than any pure DPS class.
---
As far as I can tell literally the only downside to being a warrior on a PvE server is that you are not so good at farming.
---
That's exactly the way I look at it as well. We're enemies after all! A little skirmish here and there is great, since it often attracts more players to join the fight.
---
Yeah... that isn't how it's suppose to work on retail. 
---
Man, if it is colored red it is aggressive.   A child has never called for pity in war and killed after, right?
---
Did you consider the 6 days /played to get mage to 60? If thats relevant 
---
You'd be foolish to assume it won't impact classic. People said the same thing about the merger in 2008 and how it won't impact WoW. 
---
Queue for multiple BGS. One guy takes it and see if it's a premade. (It's pretty obvious when you got rank 10-11-12-13 in the same group). If it's a premade take the other BG. 
---
people are downvoting you cause you compared their god game to live D: they're delusional
---
If you are buying mats dont even think it will be profitable. It would mean the whole server's alchemist are retards. ;)
---
sounds like what a child killer would say  
---
and no red =/= aggressive  
---
players are not mobs  
---
It's interesting because to me I'm sick of the general chat being about American politics. Feels like a live mini-reddit comment section and it's annoying
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
You don't necessarily need to farm DME, there are plenty of ways to get gold between gathering, crafting, and grinding different mobs. If you are set on doing DME then mage is not the only one who can; if you decide to go Priest instead of Druid then [Priest is able to farm DME solo too](https://youtu.be/0aY-PaThavU). Druid might be able to solo but it will probably require 2 people.
---
Wanding isn’t casting therefore you will start to regen while still doing damage, if threat is an issue. You bandage/evocate or just stand there or reposition 
---
It will "cost" you around 800g to level up a 25 alt inc professions compared to farming gold on your lvl 60 (based on my calculations in my head). That "investment" will take about 1 year to get back (based on calculations in my head). So is it worth it, maybe. It's still gonna be some work involved and it's gonna be pretty annoying to to do (based on feelings in my head). Personally I have decided not to make any lvl 35 alts for professions.
---
Nah, a little guy attacking your shins feels pretty warriorish tbh.
---
Mainly time and a sense of carelessness. Back when I played classic I just started high school and had at least 3-4 hours a day that I could play without any worries running through my mind. When I game nowadays I feel the urge to get the most out of it since my time is limited, while back in the day I couldn't care less if I 'wasted' time not doing the perfect quest route. If one quest took 30 min of travelling I still did it because of the adventurous feeling it gave me. 
---
Hopefully though, nostalgia will be stronger than my urge and I will take my sweet time and ding 60 after about 6 months haha. 
---
If I get the opportunity I'm just going to reserve every character name I want complete with how I want them to look.
---
Well, IIRC one of method said that classic isn't a priority at all since the bosses have been downed already
---
I think it's a waste of time to read.
---
It's hard to predict the economy of Classic realms. On one pserver where Arcane Crystals weren't that abundant those had relatively high price while the transmute fee was like 15-5g depending if transmutes were in mass demand or not. You get more predictable/stable/straightforward income from fishing, selling various consumables or farming stuff. Crafting fees are nice, but may be highly overrated. Selling one black lotus may be equal to weeks of transmuting.
---
/train
---
That link reminded me that the world first Onyxia was a Korean guild.
---
Does Korea still have an interest in WoW/Classic?  On the pvt server I play on I see lots of Chinese but nobody talks about Koreans
---
That is a straight up lie. Watch how retail is basically the same; you go for cookie cutter talents, you look up guides for rough stat weights.
---
You play LoL? Watch how most people look up matchups, items win% and so forth.
---
You play DotA? You’re most likely using similar sites and/or use DotA+.
---
You play Hearthstone? You most likely look up decks.
---
Literally every competitive game out there, there’s guides for them and they’re there, because people read and use them. That’s the state of online gaming these days. Barely anything is a secret anymore, and it’s somewhat expected you do your homework.
---
I agree with another comment here, this article is sensationalist. It adds a significant amount of narrative where it isn't needed and provides no new information beyond what has been available for days/weeks/months.
---
With that said, these changes could impact Classic, that's true. How? Obviously, we don't know yet. I'm willing to bet that most of it is negligible. The class-action lawsuit? Major corporations are sued all the time. I'd guess that Activision-Blizzard has dozens if not hundreds of pending lawsuits at any given time. I see zero reason that a class-action lawsuit against them regarding the Bungie news will significantly impact Classic's development.
---
I'm not an expert on this stuff, but none of it really smells of a reason to be wildly concerned.
---
My argument was aimed towards the fact that it wont be the same when classic releases because of the Knowledge of pre-raid gear that didnt exist back then, but I feel like we're talking past each other and all I'm getting are hostile responses.
---
Hehe that's awesome! I never noticed that little easter egg there. 
---
"Hello skilled rogue, I'd like you to meet frost trap and hunter's mark"  :)
---
One button rotation is common for vanilla. Still mage has conjures, polymorphs and AoE Farming options outside of a boss fight.
---
I have kids, a wife, and a job now. Playing as a 15 year old kid was great because I’d get home from school and play for 6 hours till my parents kicked me off to sleep lol.
---
Now I won’t be able to get 4 days of raiding a week. 
---
But what I will miss that won’t occur is the Arathi wars before BG’s were released. I remember there being over 300 horse and alliance battling it out there just to fight for fun.
---
This many times over. May people like the *idea* of warriors, only to realise it was simply too hard for them, or too tedious or even plain boring.
---
The chaff will in due time be separated from the wheat.
---
Playing warrior takes a special kind of autism
---
Can confirm. Am autist.
---
NE front flip when they jump. That should be more than enough!
---
And someone gets the privilege to scorch 5 times 
---
Yooo my brother was in this guild too this is crazy haha. 
---
Well to some extent. But with that logic you can just turn it around: wow i got 1% more dodge, or 1% more pet dmg, how exciting. They just embedded all these passive talents when you level up (not all, but some) in the new talent system 
---
I mean I don't need to imagine because I played retail from day one. 
---
Sure the game was a bit harder because original itemization was messed up. And yeah talent trees did make a big difference for some classes more than others. But I think ultimately the unknown is what made the game difficult. People did not understand the boss mechanics, strategies, where items dropped or how to play their class. These things is what made the game hard, not the gear. 
---
Hell on my server I was in the very first MC run and it was a pain in the ass to buff people as a paladin because Blizzard didn't implement raid wide buffs until later. Think about buffing the whole raid every 3 mins because your buffs only lasted 5 mins. \*Welcome to pallypowers addon\*
---
We have warriors trying to tank MC with fire resist gear. DPS gear. Almost all paladins were guaranteed to be trying to dps as ret. Tanks did not turn mobs the other direction. A bunch of under geared, under prepared people trying to do MC in level 50 greens.
---
Remember tier 2 loot being dropped in MC? I do. I was one of the only paladins on my server with Tier 2 loot. Then they removed tier 2 drops (minus pants)  from MC and moved it to BWL. That shit really broke the game. I was running around with multiple Tier 2 pieces while everyone else had tier 1 stuff. 
---
I guess what I am trying to say is itemization even if they went back to version 1 wouldn't mirror the original game. You just simply cannot get the exact same experience when everything about the game is known. 
---
Ping wont be as much of a problem today as it was in 2005. I very much doubt you'll play with 200+ ping in Australia but on US servers.
---
Warriors are not only the longest to level, they also require some of the most time end game if you want to pvp and pve. You need to build an entire tank set and a pvp set.
---
As a Rogue or mage, I used the same exact set and dominated both. 
---
Aussie guild member here (Unity) .  We haven’t worked raiding times exactly but we will be raiding on weekends. We do focus on letting people have a real life out of wow. We are pretty hardcore though especially at launch.
---
Feel free to PM me for more info or look at the looking for group sticky for more info.
---
Sure, there are always better sources, but I liked the article even if it has that "sensational" vibe to it.  It is well structured with a good narrative and it does a proper job on explaining what is happening right now with a company that will decide the future of the most awaited game of the year ( for me at least).
---
As to the information part, I didn't know half of all the insides, so it seemed like a good idea to share it here.
---
If rolling a mage you'll be assisting with dis-spells (yes in vanilla the whole group had to help out) spam FB, CoC, keep shields up, Evo in time, use consumables whenever beneficial etc etc, people who say you just spam FB haven't played mage in vanilla. 
---
I'm just talking from my own experience here. I was in a couple of guilds and those that actually managed to get somewhere where pretty "strict". 
---
I mean yeah you could do whatever spec you wanted, but you had to perform. I mostly played a shaman and it's not like I could show up elemental specced and perform well.
---
Even if the guilds didn't mandate it, the game itself kind of mandated it because your performance suffered majorly if you weren't specced right.
---
Neckbeard
---
Ye realized after I typed but didn't have the energy to delete lol 😅
---
I heavily disagree with your second to last paragraph. Not being an esport isn't relevant to class balance imo. Not all classes are perfectly balanced, that's just not true.
---
lol you're completely backtracking now:
---
&gt; there was plenty of non-utilized pre-raid gear that people skipped on and instead used non-optimal items.
---
"there was", "people skipped"  "used"
---
All past tense, not there will be, people will skip/use
---
Yeah, I misread... I thought it said if its an axe that's faster than 3.5 don't roll.. lol 
---
Is anything really difficult in WoW? Time consuming maybe. 
---
I'd say buying stuff is out of the question as money is hard to come by early in the game and it would be idiotic to use it when you need it for other things like an epic mount.
---
Just target and grind more mobs that drop cloth. 
---
Yes, your chances of winning a fight are swayed probably 20% depending on the skill gap/gear gap. Can be very frustrating when you swap to a VW  because a rogue has been harassing you, then mages start showing up
---
Every additional character you create increases both the initial time and gold investment, as well as the weekly return thereafter.
---
Thats why you do surveys, you estimate the amount of people coming in. Also a seperate subscription for Classic would be better since its a totally different game then BFA anyway. Make your choice what you prefer and if you like both you can pay for both. Keeps the tourist out and BFA players who like instant gratification out.
---
&gt; Not all classes are perfectly balanced 
---
 It's a ROLE PLAYING GAME. All CLASSES are viable in ALL content. All classes are needed in ALL content. If you raid you need to bring ALL classes. If you play pvp, you need ALL classes.
---
Every class is UNIQUE and have it's own flavor.
---
What the hell does "balanced" mean anyway? Are you saying that in a ROLE PLAYING GAME, every class and spec should be able to do the same damage on raid bosses? Is that what you call "balance"? In a ROLE PLAYING GAME?
---
Only time you can talk about "balance" is in an e-sport when you compete  with ranking in pvp instances. Vanilla is not an e-sport, it's an RPG, ROLE PLAYING GAME. Not every class are meant to be a dps in raids in the same way not every class is supposed to be a healer or a tank in raids.
---
This boss is what really carved out guilds. I still remember when we finally first killed it, just a bunch dude in blues who eventually took the big ones down.
---
You should be able to do 4H with 5 if you have ZG trinket and 2x T3 set bonuses.
---
I suppose you could gauge the difficultly on how much additional time I would have to invest in farming cloth while leveling. I'm not set on this specific character yet, so discovering that it would add a large time sink to the leveling process could persuade me to roll something different.
---
Holy shit, how did you come up with that name? As a fellow Dane, I mostly see people with similar Danish words/names, of items/things around their desk. Not a fucking shed made to store bicycles. :D
---
Nah, normalization was introduced in patch 1.8. Slow was still better for PvP and for fury PvE but weapon dps became the most important thing after that patch.
---
I hope you don't mean that in general. /s
---
Denial, the first stage of grief.
---
RIP Blizzard, hello Activision Blizzard.
---
Not if you have a spot you both like to farm, you run BGs, happen to be running the same dungeons, or you pass them in town? The only reason you’d be less likely to see someone is that groups would fill faster with a larger pool of players.
---
I ran into the same people all the time on larger private servers.
---
Many of us already are! Just want something that won't get shut down in 3 years or transition into TBC, which is happening to the pserver I play on.
---
I can't see it happening unless the game overtakes or becomes an equal to retail WOW.  
---
Classic is being added because the game and everything about it has already been developed.  There's no disputing how it will affect the game or lore. Throwing in new quests, maps, etc requires a whole array of people to come in and give it an okay before throwing it on live.
---
Wow Classic is simply a cash grab by reusing old content. They will do as little as possible as long as it makes money.  
---
Personally I think it would be amazing if they did this but highly, highly unlikely. At least not when they can just cook up TBC/WOTLK again. 
---
I did the math once and got it down to 6 warriors are a technical minimum but I'm not sure if would be doable in practice. Any minor bad RNG (taunt can resist even with T3 bonus and trinket up, but only 1% chance) and it all goes to hell. 5 warriors on the other hand I simply cant see how.
---
I made a warlock on the biggest private server a couple of weeks ago up til 20 and there was no 90% of players being warriors as you suggest. If anything there seemed to be a lot of shaman and hunters.  This was horde.
---
LOL
---
Enjoy being a joke. :D
---
don't think so. classic isn't a flagship product
---
Yes healers will be in demand, particularly shaman on horde. Just because of the way totems work you are going to want a bunch of them. Of course today means you are going to have more loot competition.  If you want low loot comp and needed go druid. Priests and paladins are great but they are way more played and they don't bring much unique other than needing 3, pallies for buffs.
---
Did you just call my doomguard worthless?
---
Let me invite you in my group really quick and I may show you his worth.
---
With Activision Blizzard's modern WoW server infrastructure, at least we'll all know if there's a raid forming outside the capitol city.
---
It'll give the entire zone repeated 5 second long lag spikes.
---
If this is the quality of server we get in $$$BfA$$$, how can we expect them to give better funding for Classic?
---
If they can't or refuse to fix wpvp lag in BfA (which is the current state right now) how could anyone imagine they'll suddenly fix it just for Classic but not retail?
---
I knew I remembered this guild name! You had to have been on Skullcrusher. I was in &lt;Vindictive&gt;(A) and saw you guys everywhere, weren't you PvP focused guild?
---
I definitely had tgis conversation with a GM. The name is locked to your account for a set time.
---
For some reason anyone against ganking will say some bullshit parallels to morality like they are on some high horse.   
---
good argument  
---
You have all the time in the world to level professions. Far more important is mount money.
---
That's why the real smart play is to level up first aid and sell the extra cloth on the AH.
---
Though everyone is low on gold, there is the most insane demand for *all tiers* of cloth at the start of a fresh Vanilla server.
---
Why does everyone keep parroting that like they're the fucking Nostradamus? It already happened 10 years ago
---
He doesn't talk about someone that never tried the game before. But sure we can go ask him on his stream. What i'm saying isn't questing is bad, just that if you don't know much about vanilla some quests can  make you stuck for so long, it's so often i see on private servers people at wrong places wasting so much time etc
---
If you are threat capped you will *always* do more damage **without pulling aggro** if you only frostbolt and don't wand.
---
The fact that your post is so upvoted shows just how noob the community actually is, and this is ostensibly the more "involved" part of the community.
---
People really underestimate how colossally noob the general Classic population will be.
---
That's a 5 minute flight from UC. This is not something you need plan around.
---
Leveling a warrior is hard work. Hardest work for the biggest reward.
---
You can bring like 15 warriors to a 40man raid and guilds will usually have a hard time to find GOOD warriors. So if you are good and put in the time needed to get pre-raid bis it's not gonna be a problem.
---
I got the eye for dkp. No help with mats.
---
Warriors truly are the master class of WoW. End game best PvE dmg, best PvP, survivable...
---
Not everyone has what it takes to level a Warrior and play it well.
---
But great reward awaits those who can succeed.
---
So.... you figured out my secret gold mining technique /s 😈
---
Jokes aside. I am going to exactly this. Tailoring + Alchemy on my lv35 alts. Maybe a few with Leatherworking too. I am going to multibox (5-box), so I can level 5 characters to lv35 simultaneously. It is going to be a big time-investment, yes but if you enjoy leveling up characters, it won’t be that much of a pain. In the end it will feel nice to have that gold just rolling in by little to no effort (excluding the effort in leveling ofc). I am speaking from experience btw (Nost), I didn’t multibox there but I had between 20-25 alts lv35 before shutdown. It was a lot of fun, I must say. 
---
You could also level one of them up to lv39 and twink with it (but get engineering on that one). 
---
It's not just a RPG, it's an MMORPG that makes you depend on others to do certain content, so you're subject to what the community/group perceives as a whole. There's absolutely no question that when compared to protection warriors, protection paladins are shit at their most obvious role, it's also obvious that some specs are simply under performers to the point that most decent groups will ignore them. In fact that did happen a shit ton in vanilla. That's when the balance discussions come in. What exactly does a ret paladin do that justifies him being below average at best at almost everything in the game?
---
tbh the developers worked on it in their free time
---
funny nontheless
---
Two imbalances is not a balance.
---
But even if it was, does it sound like balance to take an extra ten or twenty hours to get to sixty and in exchange now you're the best DPS and tank and PvPer forever?
---
The fact is, according to OP anyway, there are tons of warriors on pirate servers. So clearly it's not nearly hard enough work to balance out the benefits.
---
You might just be thinking too much into it. 
---
Keep in mind you are doing two things at once. Leveling and farming for mats. That's the most effective way to do both at the same time in my opinion.  The biggest mistake for a player to make is to skip doing professions while grinding and then going back to level them up at a higher level. 
---
Personally I think it's a non issue because farming for cloth is one of the easier things to do. Your bags will be filled with mats in no time. 
---
Do you have a full sized version of that fanart? It's beautiful.
---
I'm glad you enjoy it. Pushing your taste in music on others is very foolish, especially in an unrelated video.
---
*If* there is background music, it should be unobtrusive or related to the content as in WoW themed.
---
Couldn't be more wrong about this.
---
I am debating between a mage and.... idk. Played a mage in classic, but idk if I want to play one again. I know that I do not want to play a pirest, druid, or war. I definitely want to play hord because hord is awesome and not whiney pansys so no pally. 
---
I don't care about tanking or dpsing, but what I do not want to do is heal. 
---
I don't have a ton of time unfortunately so raiding would be limited and pvp is definitely not for high warlord.
---
 Any thoughts?
---
Joana's guide is for warriors?
---
Your summoned engineering pets scale off of your engineering skill. So a battle chicken or arcanite dragonling (important in raids) summoned by a Gnome engi will have a higher level.
---
Very surprised/disappointed that no one had the knowledge to mention this so far.
---
Dude if you do Montages you dont care what others might like or might not like. Because that will turn the Montage into a "BFA-MMO" Try to make everyone happy but nobody will be happy because it's shit. What I try to say is.. you take the Music YOU like and YOU think its good for the Clip/Montage/Whatsoever. Yes Music-Taste is different but if he took Techno someone else would say the same thing as you did. "OH this music is terrible". 
---
Retail Classic will have right click report, so enjoy your reports.
---
The worst feeling in the world is when you are dead set on a certain name for your main and then it's taken. Then you start to panic because you don't know any other name.
---
Make sure to have multiple backup names.  
---
&gt;there's absolutely no question that when compared to protection warriors, protection paladins are shit at their most obvious role
---
Paladins are AMAZING tanks in undead dungeons. You know, they have exorcism, Holy wrath and consecration. Do you know why? Because it's a ROLE PLAYING GAME. Paladins ahve attacks that only world on undead because it makes SENSE. Paladins are not warriors, they are paladins. The paladin class is UNIQUE and have it's own flavor. Paladins are not raid tanks, warriors are raid tanks. BY DESIGN.
---
&gt; it's also obvious that some specs are simply under performers to the point that most decent groups will ignore them. 
---
"Specs" is a made up word by players. Blizzard have never talked about "specs" in Vanilla and that "all specs should be balanced and viable" or anything like that. Vanilla is ALL about CLASSES. and ALL CLASSES ARE VIABLE and needed in ALL content.
---
Why should all classes have viable dps specs when not all classes have viable healing specs or viable tank specs?
---
&gt; What exactly does a ret paladin do that justifies him being below average at best at almost everything in the game? 
---
"Ret paladin" is a made up word. There is no such thing as a "ret paladin". There are only PALADINS. You can spend you 51 points in any way you want and do whatever you want, but the paladin is a healer who can also fill other roles if they want to try that. Paladins as a class is viable in ALL content. Paladins are BY FAR the best class in pvp and one of the best classes in PvE.
---
In Vanilla every CLASS can spend talent points however they want. Every CLASS is viable and needed in ALL content. Not every talent point you spend will be optimal and not every class can do the same amount of damage in PvE. And that is BY DESIGN because it's a ROLE PLAYING GAME. It makes sense that a holy warrior, who can heal, use bubbles, lay on hand etc etc can't do as much damage as a raging warrior. Because it's a ROLE PLAYING GAME and that is how Blizzard CHOOSE to design the game.
---
That'll be rough as guts. If you're lucky then you'll be able to pick up cloth on the AH for decent prices, and as everyone levels that might not work out so badly. Rest assured that you'll be using a fuckton of cloth though. Tailoring alone is bad enough imho. First aid by itself is doable but with Tailoring it'll be very difficult, or time consuming.
---
Do what you like.
---
People who wanna get to MC the fastest will of course power level to 60 as fast as possible.
---
You basically called me Chris Kyle, I can't argue no more.  
---
blizz was always pretty independent from the parent company (40$ overwatch release as one example), but a lot of the stuff that happened 2018 (early and late in the year) points at the possibility that this has changed fundamentally
---
10g per transmute? Doubt.
---
Okay maybr, but why on earth would you?
---
Warrior have also aoe shout in case normal one gets resisted. Basically, there is always one warrior moving at all times, you should be able to do full circle without getting 3 or 4 marks. Only danger is meteorit.
---
I haven't tried it, but would there be a problem with this tactic?
---
I miss my old rotation somehow
---
Even if it's now more interesting objectively I feel they took something I grew attached with over the years
---
The WC3 remake is also $40 and is being released at the end of 2019.  
---
Well co considering your strapped for time I would recommend Hunter or mage for ranged or rogue for melee. All three preform well at low gear levels and have great base power levels in pvp
---
no clue who that is, still not an argument  
---
I mostly hung out in undercity because of that very reason lol
---
Woah i was on Skullcrusher starting out and totally remember The End.  I ended up transferring to Dragonmaw.
---
theres an addon that does the same thing. dont know what its called but hope blizzard bans it cuz its op in pvp 
---
Pretty sure &lt;The End&gt; was still around when Skullcrusher got merged with Black Dragonflight. I feel like I remember seeing them around before I quit during WoD 
---
It never was but in your head. I made a half ass comment to what I thought was a troglodyte, or troll. Then in return called me his favorite hero Chris Kyle.&lt;3
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the changes. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they implementing changes? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a game to believe in. I want #NoChange. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they weren't gonna change anything???? This is so fucked.
---
Nice, and how about talents/spells / bugs etc?  
---
All that shit with progressive is just "to be close to what it was", but its not what it really was please LUL
---
Challenging Shout and Mocking Blow aren't actual taunts, as in they transfer the threat from the previous tank. They are temporary aggro transfers, if your subsequent taunt resists after the 6 second mocking blow/challenging duration you're basically fucked.   
---
Gimping yourself by doing the fight with less than 8 tanks isn't really ideal, it would be something to do as a necessity, but guilds that want to succeed will need to have a deep warrior raiding pool from the start as well as actively recruiting in case of people quitting.
---
Huh? I see 30% huntards, 30% rogues, probably 15% mages and then sprinkle the other classes.
---
It sure can 
---
There are not a ton of warriors lol. Huntards, rogues, and mages by far most popular
---
I think you are right then. But 6 should be at least viable.
---
The point is, pservers have more knowledgeable players and thus many many more Warriors.
---
That being said, the general consensus on this sub is wrong. Classic will be absolutely full of noobs, despite the pserver players and all the available knowledge.
---
Remember what ur name was?
---
/r/titlegore
---
Why are you saying that Prot Paladins are shit in raids by design, if that is true where do we draw the line, what supposed to be shit by design? What talents or what patch matches Blizzards design intent? Why are you talking about equal damage when I said no such thing? Why are you saying Paladins are healers that can try other roles and not damage dealers that can try other roles or tanks that can try other roles? Why is a holy warrior less valid for dps than a raging warrior when both are hybrids? All of these things you mentioned because you know they are talking points because the issues do exist. Blizzard themselves postponed paladin changes because tbc was around the corner, in fact that happened to several classes and clearly blizzard disagrees with you considering what happened next.
---
The community defined specs, that is true, but it defined it because they make sense and makes communication that much easier. Ignoring this is ignoring part of the game, its a community driven game and specs are established since vanilla, if you want to challenge that notion that's fine, but doesn't make a difference really, instead of Prot I can say deep Prot tree and the issues remain. Furthermore, Prot isn't amazing in pvp or questing, holy is by far the best tree for Paladins because what the other trees offer doesn't compensate what other classes with similar roles bring to the table in a game that breeds competition. The game being a RPG doesn't negate its imbalances
---
Happy to know that I’ll have something to do at work today. Thanks! 
---
You say "even for new players" implying that questing isn't the fastest for anyone.
---
100 days played to 60?  Someone who doesn't spend talent points until 60?  Sounds like human sloths.  
---
Did someone mention sloths?
---
 Here's a random fact!
---
Sloths tend to prefer the leaves of the Cecropia tree, sometimes known as pumpwoods.
---
What? Warriors got raid-viable Bloodthirst in 1.6 (BWL patch), as well as considering itemization that was available from pre-raid gear in retail vanilla fury warriors would have theoretically been able to be top DPS as early as 1.6, if not sooner. The only other change that had any significant effect was the 1.8 change of +hit chance being allowed to counteract the increased miss chance penalty of dual-wielding (which isn't really an issue when not fully world buffed, which most people didn't do in vanilla).   
---
Just because people didn't catch on how good warriors were until much later in retail vanilla - me being one of them, raiding as the then standard 35/5/11 build, doesn't mean that warriors suddenly got some "magical" patch in 1.11 where they became gods. Fury warriors were theoretically the best dps for over half the endgame raiding content.
---
All these years, I knew it was familiar from somewhere. I just couldn't put my finger on it.
---
It cant obviously. But it can help forget
---
Yeah seconding whoever said for rogue/warrior. It’s mostly for the highly populated classes. I’ve always played war and made a lock on ND this time. Got invited to a guild at like 55 just bc the class is in high demand. I completely understand wanting prebis for classes that have a lot of people playing them (especially since rogues/fury has just about the top dps for most of vanilla). That being said, there will be plenty of guilds who will take whoever and are just going to be there for fun. It is, after all, an MMORPG which gives way to several different play styles. 
---
Don't be an asshole, mate.
---
Going back into old 5 man content to get new items that are better than your raid gear is bad.  If the catch up mechanics are in the game from day 1, that's bad.
---
How is that stupid?  Please enlighten me, since I'm so stupid and you're such a fucking genius.
---
Oh no, I guess I have to cancel my preorder now.
---
i love those talent trees and be running any cookie cutter build. i will not even take a look at any builds in the internet. you are wrong.
---
Every day that goes by reduces the days that's needed to "pay off" a New alt though
---
I... could do without the mage's wand quest. Absolute nightmare to even try solo.
---
Retail functions differently due to all the sharding and phasing and does not necessarily need to handle that many players at once. 
---
I dont see that much warrior at higher level. People like to say warrior are op because they are best tank and dps but they forget that you have to spend 3x more times to be decent.
---
You have one of the worst leveling and farming class and the best items you can get can cost up to 1k gold each if not more and you will have to buy some if you really want to be competitive. Also lets not forget the repair bill.
---
I have seen some fury war that dont want to put the effort to do that and they are on the low end dps wise, even 
---
Nothing important so far
---
Why would it differ that much? Server population? I Will obv be flexible and change plans if the outcome is too low
---
They created them so you could google them.
---
Thanks for that vid :)
---
Good question, but it's not as easy as "how many honor kills do I need". Rank 3 is not difficult to achieve. Here's a video that explains it in detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw)
---
If its red its dead... doesn't take much just kill everyone on the opposing faction while you are leveling that is worth an HK.
---
In top end raiding. That's not where the majority is.
---
Thanks, hur you recommend me running and mining for a bit rather than just selling the CD Fee
---
There is no predefined amount of HK to rank up, it all depends on your server pvp activity.
---
Rank 3 is pretty easy to get, I always get R3 by lvl 40 by only doing Wpvp.
---
Just follow this simple motto : If it's red, it's dead.
---
100% this. that carelessness and time. even got around 8h a day. nothing to worry about. 
---
Yo, I'm planning on doing the same! In addition to the Arcanite transmute, don't forget about the Essence of Undeath to Water, should be another 5g per day.
---
How about a source? :) 
---
Yes, at a linear rate compared to the initial investment. More characters doesn't raise or or lower the time required to make a return at all. I haven't done the math so these specific numbers are uneducated guesses, but let's say it takes 4 days /played to level a character to where it is making money from transmutes. And let's say it takes two weeks to begin making a return on that time and gold spent. Doing two characters would take 8 days /played and 4 weeks to return. Three would take 12 days /played and 12 weeks. Etc.
---
I mean levelup and making money buying herbs isnt going to be profitable (unless you make them and sell them much later when the demand changes the prices).
---
With harder and harder rotations those small reactions can give you the edge over other players. Believe it or not but a lot of people are competitive. Even if the 5% DPS isn't a make a break for the raid its still something. The more I read from this subreddit the more I feel like it's mostly people who want it to be as casual as retail but slower without LFG and more RPG elements(which I'm for).
---
Lets say I do 40g/h that makes it about 1800g worth of time Lvling., making that back takes 6 month
---
If you want to stay up to date without researching news by yourself, i recommand subscribing to the YT-Channel ["MadSeasonShow"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvz3kkYZtCTeXKdiuMG8eg). He made several Videos about classic news and Vanilla in general. 
---
Once there are some exciting news he will do a video on them for sure.
---
Is this if I farm materials myself included?
---
What on earth was wrong with your guild leader.  I would not wish that torture on any one
---
Do you have a source? Pets also have higher levels, so I could imagine the death ray being better too. 
---
Your arguing something i didn't postulate.  I'll have to end our debate as its going no where.
---
&gt;Why are you saying that Prot Paladins are shit in raids by design, if that is true where do we draw the line, what supposed to be shit by design?
---
When Blizzard designed Vanilla they made some classes into healers. They intentionally made paladins, shamans, druids and priests healers for raids and not dps. You can find interviews with vanilla developers that explain this. It's by design! Did you think it was a coincident that all heal-hybrids are doing low damage in raids?
---
&gt; Why are you talking about equal damage when I said no such thing? 
---
Yes you did:
---
Or what do you mean with "below average" if not damage? Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's usually damage in raids people talk about when they talk about balance.
---
&gt; Why are you saying Paladins are healers that can try other roles and not damage dealers that can try other roles or tanks that can try other roles? 
---
It's what Blizzard said. Paladins are by design healers in Vanilla and they are by design not raid dps in Vanilla. I can see if I find a video with an interview I have seen.
---
&gt; Why is a holy warrior less valid for dps than a raging warrior when both are hybrids?  
---
Well as a role playing element the holy warrior have heals, lay on hand and can do holy damage on undead. Nothing in this world comes for free and they have to train and study and don't have as much time to work out their muscles. If you want to have all these awesome holy spells, you can't hit as hard. RPG logic. By design.
---
&gt; Blizzard themselves postponed paladin changes 
---
Yes they did indeed. They choose not to balance specs in Vanilla and instead choose to balance CLASSES in Vanilla. Later on in TBC they choose to balance specs. Paladins as a CLASS is VERY good if not the best class in the whole game during Vanilla.
---
We are getting Vanilla now and not TBC. When/if we get TBC classic I am looking forward to the spec balances. It will be awesome. But that's not Vanilla.
---
&gt;in fact that happened to several classes and clearly blizzard disagrees with you considering what happened next. 
---
Actually Blizzard agree with me. Here is a quote from Blizzcon 2018:
---
&gt;The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;― Ion Hazzikostas, Blizzcon 2018  
---
&gt;Source: [https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1917](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1917)
---
&gt;  its a community driven game  
---
NO it's NOT. Classic wow is a historical recreation of the game as it was.
---
Again, you don't want Vanilla. That's fine. You want something different. Can you you atleast admitt that you don't actually want Vanilla?
---
Personally, I want Vanilla. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
/rude on dwarf male
---
I don't understand why are you beeping out "cunt" but leaving "fuck" as it is. Does english language has different tiers of curses or something?
---
Well I have a while to do the math, thanks for the input!
---
Thanks! :)
---
Or the equivalent saying if you're playing Horde: "If it blue, hit it with your shoe!"
---
Yes
---
Basically yes. 
---
Lol
---
I think that the ignorance of Vanilla player ignorance is the biggest rose tinted glasses that this sub has.
---
We can’t ignore that we’ve gotten years of playtime to KNOW what’s best, optimal, and necessary.  As such, it is going to be expected from any progression oriented group that you set your character up optimally to get a spot.  Why? Because while you could do the content with scrubs who don’t care about that stuff, you’re going to be slower as a result.  
---
Vanilla offers different challenges than just endgame, but WoW will always be endgame dominant. We can reset the content, but not what the expectation of players has become.

that could be a nice goal for me too. always thought about it. in wotlk when i played the most i just tried to do all the achievement when i had nothing specific to do. were around 10k points when i stopped playing at the end off wotlk. and it was fun.

I like to /pat shapeshifted druids and dwarves

You're going to have a bad time in Desolace with the Gelkis and Magram reputation my dude.

Classic is almost free money for Activision Blizzard. Not very much work, no risk, huge revenue probably running to $millions per month. The most amazing thing, from their point of view, is once they've done the initial work then the less subsequent development work they do the happier their customer base will be.
---
If you think the top suits at Activision Blizzard are a bunch of money-hungry corporate assholes who don't really care about games (hint: they probably are) then you should have no fear for Classic - they must *love* that there's a queue of customers stretching several times round the block waiting to buy this old product all over again.

When Classic hits you WILL be rock-hard !
---
Just wait for the digital deluxe preorder, just like every other one. People will be preordering in droves.
---
Classic is on the exact same infrastructure as retail. The devs gave some detail about it at blizzcon.
---
It's on the same infrastructure and all they needed to do was "flip a switch" to turn on sharding, which they had in the Classic demo.
---
You can powerlevel a toons to lvl 35 in less than a day with a mage/pal/priest through instance.
---
Have your main herb and farm what is needed to up alchi to 275.
---
Also make your alts tailoring so you can craft mooncloth.
---
Let's say you up one per week, you sell your transmut CD for 5g and mooncloth CD for 10g, after a month you'll be generating +-220g/week which should be enough for your daily shopping.
---
Could make more if you farm the mats for the transmut and mooncloth instead of just selling the CD.
---
You should keep some dozens mooncloth in bank for when Naxx is released and price go up by nearly 100% for some nice gold in end game.
---
Why do you think you have this entitlement to more information? Stop being a child.
---
I got rank 3 (playing on a pserver) simply by defending myself from ganks / wpvp on my way to lvl 60, running no bgs at all.
---
If you play on a pvp server it should take virtually no effort to get rank 3.
---
Can we get a tl;dr on ActiBlizz's corporate structure? I would really like to listen to this podcast but I don't have 3 hours I can take out of my day, unfortunately.
---
You are not reading anything I'm saying. Your just glossing over it. I never said Paladins should top DPS meters, go ahead and quote me where I said that
---
Performing below average means several things, they are below average in questing, in raids and in pvp which are pretty much the big 3 things. Ret Palas are not really good in pvp.
---
See, there's quite a bit of miscommunication here. I'm saying specs are imbalanced and you're hearing I want changes. You're wrong. That doesn't make specs balanced though and blizzard agrees
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**”
---
&gt; “[A Protection Paladin] was fine generating threat as long as the mob was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. **We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt** so we were still experimenting and learning as we went.”
---
Just some quotes showing that blizzard was fully aware of the shortcomings of some of the balance. They were imbalanced.
---
&gt;You are not reading anything I'm saying. Your just glossing over it. I never said Paladins should top DPS meters, go ahead and quote me where I said that
---
And I never said you did?
---
as someone who only started in tbc, can someone explain to me how the ranks work? is there an exact amount of kills i need for rank 14? wont have that much time too as when i was in school, but i will aim for the highest rank i can get :P
---
Yeah rank 10 should doable.  I did it as a grad student and didn't pvp super seriously.  I was in a high end raiding guild and we would only pvp in our off time.  
---
You basically have to live in the game and do nothing but pvp to get rank 14.
---
From what I've watched recently he looked to be a frotlst mage with engineering
---
It's not feasible honestly. 
---
You will need to play 2-3hours a day and binge on weekends if you want to succeed in a reasonable amount of time. 
---
The less you play the longer it takes exponentially, because decay will always shave off some of your efforts. You can easily rank to 7/8 on 10-12 hours but 9 and 10 will need some time, so best to just grind 9 and 10 on break.
---
Also you probably wont be able to motivate yourself when you get like 5-10% per week at rank 9 and 10 and you know you can do nothing but PvP for the next 10weeks to gain one rank. 
---
Ranking in vanilla is a sprint. You start, pull through and be done with it. It is no marathon in which you can play for 10months and have the same result as a ranker who does the same in 3 even you both play the same over the 10months period.
---
I am the grind
---
zero clue what you're rambling about  
---
This is it. Nobody had any idea what they were doing and most of us were reliant on guildies helping us out. Forums were a thing since many years before, but many players never visited them (and many didnt even know about Thottbot) so everything was unknown, and thus hard. 
---
i realy wish theyd make an article instead
---
My guild even let me go as a Shadow Priest. We had something like 4 or 6 warlocks in our raiding team and they all loved the +15% shadow damage taken debuff.
---
It was awesome back then. 
---
that is a question that is impossible to answer as it depends on your competition.  
---
i've done r10 by playing 3/7 days a week from 7pm to 11pm. thats roughly 12h per week.  
---
its possible for sure.   
---
will it be possible on the realm you choose? who knows.
---
Exactly, people are much more internet-savvy than they were 15 years ago, and the tools are extremely easy to find.  A huge majority of players will be using the cookie cutter builds that yield the best results.
---
Thanks!
---
Well you did say that they shouldn't be doing the same dps as a raging warrior, which is topping meters pretty much but I see now that you were most likely just throwing out a random comparison rather than really saying they should be competing with warriors in the meters
---
A ret or prot paladin at a similar progression point to other similarly skilled players will not be great when compared to most specs. Holy Paladins are monsters though
---
If you can't get Rank 14 as a student I'm not sure you will handle what comes after college :D
---
On a serious tone, 12 hours per week is not going to get you to rank 11 most likely. 10 will be reachable, the problem is it doesn't give you really solid gear so that at some point you will have to spend some of that time running a couple of raids to gear up.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/spell=20593/engineering-specialization#comments

First comment explains it very well.
---
Basically, the +15 skill is applied when learning new skills but not when calculating skillups, effectively adding +15 extra levels of orange to any new recipe.
---
I had almost only gnomes in retail and only realized this when I tried to level engineering on a nelf hunter near the end of tbc.
---
Probably not that well the first night of attempts haha. Don't remember how many weeks it took us to get him, i'll have to check the dates on the kill screenshots
---
The guild name rings a bell! We we're kinda half and half. I think we had one of the first high warlord on the server - a troll enhancement shaman
---
Indeed he did, along with most of Vanilla for us
---
More than acceptable? Sometimes I wait 5-10 minutes for a DotA and I can see that's acceptable kinda but I can be patient for my ability drafts. Why make a regular PVPer wait 20 minute for a match? It'd be nice to at least have a choice after 10min. I can just see plenty of casuals not liking that and returning to games just like DotA because they are stuck on a server with 20+ min ques. Either they have to transfer or go do chores while they wait. Wouldn't people want more casuals to feed off of?
---
It's not difficult, you'll just need to plan your leveling route differently. Prioritize quests that target humanoids. Try and do those quests when they're easier, so you can prioritize kill speed. Any time you find a nice humanoid camp that nobody else is farming, it's time to grind. You can pretty much level up a single cloth tier on first aid in 1-2 hours of farming which will also give you decent exp and cash.
---
Look for high priority patterns to sell, you may be able to offset the costs of buying cloth or mats. Robes of Arcana for quests, Star Belts do quite well if you can get the pattern, there's always demand for the  Shadoweave and Dreamweave sets. Personally I hope they go with pre 1.12 bag drop rates, during actually vanilla you could always reliably level up tailoring by doing free combines of people's cloth to make them bags, but with 1.12 and private server rates that's been taken away. Given that the new mentality of the hardcore players is not to mess around with trade skills to 60 and the new players won't be that familiar with trade skills, maybe there's an opportunity for money making in tailoring.
---
That being said, the various cloth classes that generally want tailoring can often get away with leveling it fast at 60, or at least leveling it once they outwear the farm mobs such that you can quickly farm up cloth. As a mage you have many defensive options, so it's not the end of the world to not have FA. Priests generally won't even touch a bandage until they enter raiding, and while it's really nice for warlocks thanks to life tap, it's not essential, you can also just drain life so that you're simultaneously doing damage as well as healing up. Me personally, I took the time out to grind the cloth, but putting off FA is certainly not debilitating.
---
i got hit on there when i first started 6 months after launch
---
Yes solid points. I didn't realize the griefing that came along with it as well. Hopefully blizzard figures something out
---
&gt;Well you did say that they shouldn't be doing the same dps as a raging warrior
---
That is correct. As a role playing element in an RPG it makes sense that the holy warrior who can heal and use bubble and lay on hand and blessing etc etc should do less damage than a raging warrior. I never shared my opinion on how much damage they should do other than it makes sense that it's less. It's not really about my opinion. It's about Vanilla, and that is how Vanilla is designed.
---
What you need to understand is that Paladins are doing low damage in raids BY DESIGN because they are designed to be healers in raids. The ret and prot tree are designed for quests, dungeons and pvp in Vanilla. Its the same for all healer-hybrids.
---
I get it. You don't like this. You want the specs to be balanced in Vanilla like they where in TBC. That's fine, but that's not Vanilla.
---
If this could be transcribed in some way that'd be fantastic.
---
It's great to have youtube for video and all these pods popping up, but don't forget us traditionalists who much prefer text.
---
"Giant company takes on loads of debt to buy up the smaller companies who are actually innovating things rather than spending the money and innovating themselves. It's far cheaper to buy the smaller guys who have achieved something big rather than to research it yourself. They take small companies reputation and products to drive sales, generally increasing the price while doing so. Fast forward 5 / 10 years and you'll have what you have right now, a behemoth of a company so far disconnected from it's fan base that they literally get laughed at on stage at their biggest conference. "Don't you guys have wallets?!?"
---
This is nothing new. Pharmaceutical companies have been doing this for a LONG time. There's an episode of Netflix's "Dirty Money" about Valeant Pharmaceuticals which does this exact thing. Unfortunately we don't always have a second option with our drugs, however we do with our video games. Speak with your wallet and these money hungry triple A companies like Activi$ion will start to lose the only thing they care about - MONEY.
---
Want to know why Classic is becoming a thing? Money.
---
Want to know why D3 had a cash shop? Money.
---
Indie and smaller publishers are some of the only titles I play anymore and I don't even consider myself and Indie gamer. Nearly all triple-A publishers churn out junk these days IMO.
---
Quick but pretty thorough breakdown from Staysafe: https://youtu.be/yFbX5drsnAw
---
you could even earn real in game gold... or so I hear
---
Im not disagreeing that casual players were very abundant 15 years ago but I think YouTube, streamers and just the internet as a whole has made people so much more connected that even casual players will look up a YouTube video on "best pvp mage spec" back in the day you had to dig through non official forums and read up on theorycrafting to min max, now you just click on a video and it says "hey guys this is insert YouTube name here, bringing you the most op spec for, mages at this gear level" with more and more addons like dps meters and so on you can only have min max players shaming you before you think, maybe I am bad? How do I fix it. 
---
In summary I'm gonna bet that classic is gonna be much more min max, with a sprinkle of anti meta people who internally ignore the meta and an even smaller sprinkle if people who honestly don't know about "meta" and those people will rapidly get dragged into the other two camps.
---
Here's a decent video with lots of information: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw)
---
I prefer the battle groups, I still recognized plenty of people and enjoyed the fast ques. Always plenty of casuals enjoy fast ques, more people to kill and farm. Can't wait to hear blizzards response to PVP bgs
---
Once you reach Booty Bay you will find out just how true that is.
---
Hey I had Dreamweave on my mage thank you very much!
---
this^^
---
One reason for not telling us every news immediately is that they might change their minds about  (debatable) changes from vanillas original form. Once they announce something its way harder for them to back paddle assuming the community accepts the announcement and didnt rant in the first place.
---
Another reason could be that the devs actually dont know about how to implement certain features or how to balance them. 
---
In the end its up to you to trust blizz. There are some big news to come but in my opinion the already shown footage and the test servers acutally gave enough confidence in blizzard to create an aesthetic vanilla experience. 
---
You're being down voted, but you're correct.  People can play/spec however the hell they want, but when it comes to raiding, I wouldn't want to struggle on end game content with people knowingly gimping their dps/healing because they want to spec how they want, as opposed to the optimal spec that they know exists. Thats just selfish.
---
Wiping on a boss at 3%, knowing that it would've died if HordeSlayer69X was spec'd properly, isn't cool to the 39 other people.
---
Noooow things make sense. Thanks.
---
Which is a MASSIVE change from actual vanilla, which is just more Nostbabies admitting they don't want pure vanilla, they want Nost back.
---
No, you do not. They completely ruin the games community and were the start of the downfall of the genre.
---
They could even just "recruit" a full guild into their fold and have them play under the Method name if they see money in it. 
---
Rank 10 is about as high as a casual player can hope to reach, and even that will require many consecutive weeks pushing to your maximum. Because of the decay, and the fact that you're measured by how much other people play as much as yourself, then there's a ceiling you just can't break through.
---
The system is described here: [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_system\_(pre-2.0)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))
---
The formulas are all here: [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_system\_(pre-2.0\_formulas)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas))
---
Crossrealm bgs were in vanilla though, so it's more an argument of No MY vanilla not your vanilla
---
Yeah. Cross server bgs in is a deal breaker and I will not play classic if it's in. Literally any type of cross server tech needs to not exist for classic to be a real classic experience. I don't give a shit if 1.12 added cross server bgs, that's when the game went downhill.
---
Is the bigger servers or no battlegroup the massive change?
---
Battlegroups were a very late addition, increased server pop can go fuck itself though, no thank you to black lotus for well over 100 gold each because there's like what, 3-5 spawns an hour and 10,000 players online at once.
---
So after 3 years and naxx have been out for 1 year or so. Do you just wanna stay on that realm forever?
---
Personally I want to start fresh and/or continue in TBC Classic.
---
Very true, it also reminded me of the Overwatch comparison.  If you want to 1-trick symmetra, go do so in Arcade/quick play, have a blast!  But don't be selfish in competitive mode and ruin 5 other players experience.
---
Don't ruin 39 other peoples raid because you want to play a spec that does 20% less damage than you could be doing. 
---
It really does depend on server size. Say somehow you get the worst server in the bunch and peak is 1500 players six months in. R12-13 could very well be doable if there aren't that many people interested in pvp and you stick with the 10-12 hours a week for several months. I was on a medium population server and watched a mage nobody liked get to R13 solo queuing from ~4pm-10pm during the week. You could easily get at least the honor he was getting in less time with a premade. R14 is out of the question.
---
A lot of those cuts were asked for by the vocal community over the years though.  Prime example of how devs cant always cater to the players.
---
 Hello, I consider myself a part time competitive gamer and I want to make my first extremely dedicated go on classic wow. I'm looking to join a small core group of 3-4 to coordinate with and obtain our mutual goals. If you'd like to start working together please contact me!

* (NA)
---
* (PvP)
---
* (HORDE)
---
* Intended raid/play times (730-1030 EST M-F MIN+Extremely flexible schedule and dedicated playstyle)
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, Low Tension high results, priority looting based on involvement)
---
* I'll be dedicating the first 9 days of launch to racing for level 60 and wealth hording, I'm looking for like minded individuals who can afford to take the time off work to gain an edge in game.

---
This, an I'm an avid pod listener. This is just not a topic I want to trudge thru for 3 hours
---
Hard to say. The more active your battle group is, the harder it will be to get those last few ranks.
---
I'd say rank 10-11 is very doable with 12 hours per week, esp if you find a premade. 
---
Reading this article made me realize that they probably wont listen to us about the loot sharing issue.  If having loot sharing means they dont need as many GM's answering tickets, you can bet your bottom dollar Activision wont hesitate to institute it.  Activision doesnt care about the affect of loot sharing on the community if it streamlines their operation.
---
Whatever mod edited my thread title needs to grow the fuck up and have their modding ability revoked. The opening first sentence of my post says
---
"Not until TBC pre-patch, at least. Edit: Not until MUCH later into the games cycle."
---
FFS. Grow the fuck up, dude.
---
Here's a few tips:
---
Furblog cave in northern Ashenvale-Drops linen, wool, and occasionally silk like hot cakes.
---
Kurzen camp in STV, lots of cloth, greens, and other things that sell well. 
---
Ghosts in south western Azhara drop lots of mageweave.
---
I've always thought this was Princess Zelda for some reason....
---
no you will need multiple ranks of the same spell for pvp. Pve too if your a healer
---
Honestly I'm hoping Mike Morhaime gathers some key devs and key talent and starts his own game dev company. If Metzen joins in it would basically be an unleashed Blizzard with investors lined up.
---
It's not uncommon. In 1979 Bob and Harvey Weinstein founded a company called Miramax. They sold the company to Disney in 1993, but both continued operating Miramax until the frustrations with Disney reached their peek in 2005. Then they started over with a new company, The Weinstein Company.
---
As it turns out, the Weinsteins retained all of their social connections and industry talent, Miramax was a dead shell of a company anyway, and The Weinstein Company turned out to be far more successful. (Until Harvey Weinstein raped everyone.)
---
Moral of the story: Mike Morhaime has the potential to start over and create a better Blizzard.
---
That's why I said keep the battlegroups small, if you have only 5 servers that's not so many people that they are nameless
---
Good point!
---
As someone that did this in vanilla and TBC (to put it in perspective, the day achievements came out, Loremaster was already finished for me) get a quest addon working early (I didn't even try until there was a good addon and I spent a fair amount of time wandering around letting it know, yes, I did that one). The modern ones will keep track of what you've finished and will show quests below your level if you want. The worst part tho, by far, is the number of random weird quests that depend on a random BoP drop. https://classicdb.ch/?item=4614 that one comes to mind, for instance, but there a lot. So many I don't even remember all of what I did, but it took me a long time. I'm reasonably certain I finished every quest that it was possible for my race/class combo to do in in the entirety of vanilla, outside of profession quests. I did finish the few Herbalism/Alchemy quests and later on, in TBC, the Leatherworking ones when I switched. 
---
Just be prepared to be constantly finding out about new weird quests that start from random items. The ones that start from an NPC are usually really easy to find. The others... oof. 
---
Basicly Method has already competed on these bosses back in the day, although in Vanilla they were "a bit" more "casual" than now. Seeing they only came in 49th on KT, in TBC method got more serious though claiming world 2nd on Lady Vashj for example (or World First if you discount the bugged/exploited kill nihilum had).
---
Too many facts for u i guess :)
---
I know a lot of newcomers on vanilla pservers. People who never even played WoW before. People who never played vanilla before. I think people who think they KNOW what is going to happen are delusional. 
---
How can you guarantee that? 
---
I remember when going through SW I had to look at the ground, otherwise getting through the city was impossible.
---
No reason to level first aid in the beginning. As a mage you will have all the food you want. It's easier to wait until the economy stabilizes then you can level first aid for extremely cheap. 
---
in my first guild our 2 thunderfury went for the GM he was mt and the 2nd to the warrior with the most attendance to raid. ( all guildmate helped to craft it)  
---
hand of Ragnaros went to whoever wanted generally paladin he had to take of arcanite bars himself , he was just given the MC mat needed. ( still some ppl helped)  
---
the 2nd guild i went in late vanilla Atiesh went to a Priest who was also the Guildmaster  
---
Cant remember but did doomguard do a russian roulette for the people clicking on the summoning portal ...?
---
No, you are insane!
---
Nobody is disputing that, having progressive itemisation won't make the game harder because it's not a hard game for the most part.
---
It does however increase the importance of raid loot over dungeon loot, which is kinda how It should be and was intended to be.
---
Thanks :) 
---
yeah i really hope one of the changes they include in the game is to track low level quests. its super minimal but would mean a lot to people like me and you that want to do 100% completion.
---
Yeah... Do you have any actual source for that? Or is this just an assumption.
---
I disagree completely on Weaker. Play style and power wise the adventurers are waaay stronger now. Like compare frost bolt to comet storm and fireball to meteor. Not to mention stuff like Cataclysm, demonology in general, Ascension .etc
---
You don't make 70g a week.
---
Arcanite Bar transmute is on a 2 day cooldown and it's like 7-8g
---
Or you can do essence of undeath to essence of water every day but it only nets about 4g so it's all the same. 
---
I always make an alchemist alt because I actually enjoy the time I spend leveling to 35 and also it lets me craft my own pots because it's annoying having to bother an alchemist friend multiple times a week to make stuff.
---
Game was designed with PvP in mind first not PvE, so yes PvE rotations are super easy.
---
I kinds want to do this from the get go, since the first year of vanilla is probably gonna be mc/DM anyway.
---
I hope any good questing addons gets created during beta. Otherwise I will have to go off the quest database. Thanks for your reply.
---
Grind the winterspring sabre mount, ally only
---
You're right about when it releases, I don't agree that it massively skews the pvp scene though.
---
It's only a 3 hour long episode!
---
We also show violence but god forbid someone sees a nipple
---
Get a mount but have to play as the scum of the earth? Nah bro
---
Branix, Human Paladin
---
&gt; You can powerlevel a toons to lvl 35 in less than a day with a mage/pal/priest through instance.
---
But then your taking up not only your time but someone elses. 
---
In that same 10 hour or whatever span you both could have farmed 600g. 
---
Pretty sure vanilla quests don't suggest a number of players for a quest. They are just listed as elite quests suggesting you will need a party to complete it.
---
Bigger servers is a huge change. Playing on the Nost-based uberservers frankly feels closer to playing live with CRZ that it does to actual vanilla. Reputation matters far less, changes like dynamic spawning become necessary just to make the game playable, the economy is fucked.
---
CRBG however IS PURE VANILLA. You don't get to downvote every person who sticks their head up and asks "what about..." with a bunch of "NO CHANGES!" screams and then when people talk about CRBG, which is literally undebatably a part of vanilla say "well....it was only the last patch...."
---
But is one of the most respected grinds in vanilla, next to obtaining scarab Lord, or zg tiger
---
There definitely are a lot of people who aren't playing the game to play the game. Rather the fun is in acquiring stuff. Gear, rep, gold, honor, levels etc. Which is why they don't like running about doing foolish things that don't give them any rewards. 
---
Good god.. 2400 hours
---
The Black Templar chapter motto is, No Pity, No Remorse, No Fear.
---
As opposed to just sitting around in the game or are you insinuating that they might not even play at all?
---
I do not like what you are doing to me. Snake tongue!
---
I get the impression that the suits are a bit moth-like though. Some MBA is going to bring a graph in with the "earnings potential if we alter this" lines taller than the "earnings potential if we release it with original systems" and I fear that they'll dumbly fly into that light. 
---
Ive heard the CD is 24 and 48 hours what is the correct? Well It was mostly an overhaul but thanks for correcting me :)
---
I have heard feral druids are viable (although not ideal) on the weaker 2 horseman which  could slightly lower the need for warriors.  True/possible/false?
---
Like the other guy said hunter or rogue would be a good project. Keep mage as a side project
---
&gt; and PvPer forever?
---
I really wish people would add "when babysat by a dispell healer or outgearing your opponent by at least 2 tiers."
---
Solo PvP Warrior is hands down the worst class in the game. If you're not being kited to hell and back you're just chilling in a 1 minute poly twiddling your thumbs.
---
So if you have the goblin blow the door, then don't talk to the guy, eventually some will hearth?  Who will?  Don't two of them drop gear (the human guy and the orc I think)?
---
No I said i was in favor of gating items even upgrading items with different patches.  Im a bigger fan of blizzards 4 patch plan instead of 12 patches.  Personally i think 4 patches is too little and 12 patch too much.  Id like to see MC patch with ony and DM.  I think paladins and warlocks should be able to get their class mounts at launch.  Than patch 2 is BWL. Patch 3 is ZG.  The ZG enchants and gear (for some classes) will e better than BWL gearm. I think they should be separate by patches.  Patch 4 AQ.  Patch 5 Naxx.  Maybe even a patch in there to open up exalted items for battlegrounds.  So 6 patches.  I like gating/upgrading items throughout patch cycles.  Personally id like to see some of the dungeon items from lvl 20-45 to have some of their buffed states.  Yes this makes lvling easier but it doesnt effect raiding.  If the items are buffed more people will run dungeons and it will be more fun.  Some items in end game dungeons are gated and they do not trivialize raiding content at all.  Some of these items such as angerforges battleaxe arbiters blade avalchions stony hide really dont effect raiding much and should be considered to stay at launch in their 1.12 form.
---
Rotations just aren't a thing in vanilla. The only classes that have anything resembling a live rotation are dps wars, feral druids, and hunters, and even then it's more of a simple priority system than rotation. Shadow priests might be on that list as well, but show up much less frequently in raids.
---
Vanilla raiding is more about the logistic challenges of 40 people preparing consumes and gear, and then getting them all to actually function as a team. Gameplay wise it's more about making sure you survive than it is a nuanced dps rotation. You can get some more action out of properly timing your cool downs, potions, trinkets, etc. Occasionally you'll have moments to shine, like AoEing down goblins in lab packs, but for the most part raiding isn't about you as an individual, it's about the experience as a team.
---
Personally I would roll on a instant 60 server in your situation to get the feel. I'm actually rolling shaman this time around when I have always mained priest. However that's just for my duo, I'll be leveling priest in my own time because I love them so much. Mix up your flavor a bit
---
Love when people actually cared about getting the dungeon sets even though they are "bad"
---
Lmfao!!!
---
A mixture of zero ingenuity and memes I guess :p I was younger then and it seemed like a good idea LMAO
---
I was a high school/college student during vanilla and made it to Knight-Captain while raiding casually.
---
Wasn't threat an issue which was changed in the later patch (and/or prot warriors buffed)?  I remember having 1 odd fury warrior in our guild and he did okay DPS if he didnt pull aggro and die.  They had no way to dump threat so no matter what their "theoretical" DPS was they were never able to achieve it.
---
NW is great! I just dont have it in me to lvl x1 until summer comes, ill hold myself back ^^ did dip into it for a bit though but only made it to 20. 
---
Had a great impression of what I saw though 
---
O_o? PvP was a total afterthought, the devs had to fight to keep it in. There wasn't even an honor system until 1.4, first BGs came out 1.5. The WPvP objectives in EPL and Silithus were added even later, far too late in the game to really matter.
---
Oh DKP days....I remember clearing Molten Core for weeks on end and I barely ever got Nightslayer. The only thing I got out of MC was Perdition's Blade (which was sweet).
---
We then ran BWL when it opened, I went from an outrageous amount of DKP to being in the negative with 6/8 bloodfang and a chromatically tempered sword.
---
It should be possible as much of dmg is spell based. Druids can stack quite a lot of stamina. Most videos I have seen are from private servers though.
---
No we give no fucks about anything. 
---
I am afraid there are some big flaws with it, though.
---
Some options are just so much superior to others that it is hard to call the inferior ones viable. IMO it works out pretty well for classes like priests or hybrid classes. But in practice, it is bad for pure dps classes IMO.
---
It’s both. Essence of undeath -&gt; water is 24 and arcanite is 48
---
You only get to use one or the other FYI 
---
Transmutes other than the arcanite bar transmute are on 24 hour cooldown. Arcanite bar transmute is 48 hour cooldown. The cooldown is shared so if you transmute arcanite you can't do any transmutes for 48 hours, if you transmute say undeath to water then you can't do any transmutes for 24 hours.
---
Josh you’re brilliant, this should chew up most of my work day. Thanks
---
I wouldn't call vanilla pruned, after all vanilla had far more abilities. There's really 2 differences. First, vanilla gives you the whole player toolkit, where live gives you a tiny subset based on your spec. Second, vanilla was just full of flavorful niche abilities. Live ripped out all the fun and replaced it with more dps options.
---
Each "fresh" kill gives a bunch of honor, but as you keep killing the same person (daily reset), the honor goes down to a fraction of what a fresh kill is worth. On the average realm this meant that you got far less honor for farming past a certain point, as you'd basically have killed everyone queuing, which in turn meant that a couple long sessions per week would net you less than if you put in the same time but spread out more over the week. 
---
What this actually means is that the weekend heroes would rank much lower than those who could play a decent amount of time every day. If Xrealm BGs are in from the beginning, this means ranking will be based, in a larger way, on the amount of time played, as you will keep facing fresh players. 
---
The classic honor system already promoted an excessively unhealthy behaviour (playing all day every day for higher rankings), but with xrealm BGs this will be even worse, as every hour spent is worth even more than it otherwise would have. The queue will also be much shorter, which is a good thing, but also means less time to stretch your legs as well as any breaks you take will hurt more.
---
&gt;Want to know why Classic is becoming a thing? Money.
---
See, you say this like it's a negative. Blizzard is providing a product that people want, and we're willing to pay for it. Why are you trying to demonize both Blizzard and their customers by making it seem like everyone is falling into some elaborate money trap? 
---
What class do you play?
---
No kidding! I almost subscribed this morning until I saw those episode lengths.
---
I am by no means a competitive PvPer but I have played the game for close to 15 years now. What I found really helped my PvP game was playing every different class to a relatively high level and learning about their different abilities. To be great at PvP you have to know what the guy coming at you is most likely going to do. That is made much easier if you're very familiar with their classes' tool kit. Since we have a few months until classic launches you could try a few different classes out on some private servers or just watch breakdown videos on each class on youtube.
---
This
---
Mage as a main for launch. Though I feel I'd need to learn all the classes to play against each effectively. 
---
I haven't played WoW in a LONG time.  I played from day 1 of Vanilla and stopped playing a week before BC came out.  I then played for a few months during WoTLK.
---
So my advice may be dated because my main pvp days were around 2005/2006.  
---
You need to learn every classes spells/abilities.  You have to learn each classes play style to predict what they will do before they do it.  
---
As a rogue, I knew that most of the time, when I approached a Mage, I was about to be frozen or they would blink.  So I would make sure my vanish CD was up and that I need to sap that mage so if he does blink, he will blink sap'd.
---
Once I learned each class, I became a million times better at playing a rogue.  I got really good when I sat outside Ironforge dueling all day.  I would ask questions to every class and see how to improve.
---
You're not 14 years old anymore and this is not 2008, time to stop being a manchild and grow up man.
---
Maybe you should watch other class PVP gameplay to learn the gameplay of those class to be able to anticipate during a fight. Or playing other classes help a lot too.
---
Speaking from experience, you cannot do both. You can get your first aid simultaneously with tailoring up until you get to Silk Cloth, at which point you have barely enough Silk to get through tailoring itself. 
---
That being said, I always go for tailoring and save First aid for when I am 60. Robe of the Archmage from tail should be your n.1 priority at max level so you need it anyways. 
---
And honestly, I dont miss FA while leveling too much. Mage in wPvP should always kite their oponents and when they touch you, it's already late and FA wont save you. When grinding/lvling, I always try to balace how much mana I spend vs how many hits I take so I can drink and eat at the same time.
---
At lvl 60, it's a different story but at that point, FA wont be too expensive to level up.
---
So you are playing mage currently on private server?
---
Thanks
---
It's not true that Paladins were designed to be simply healers in raids. They just were poorly balanced elsewhere
---
I don't want the balance for classic though and I never wanted that to happen, I was just challenging the idea that they are balanced due to the history of the game, there's no indication that blizzard didn't want Prot Paladins raiding
---
I have played pretty much every class, but I've spent more time learning their PvE rotations and such. I definitely should watch a lot more when it comes to PvP. 
---
ahh i guess that's true, wrong wording. I myself when i speedlevel use Joana's guide which is 80% questing 20% farming. The problem i see with new players though is they try to do 100% questing instead of 70/30 or 80/20. Their isn't enough quests to do 100%, or the quests to do 100% takes so long so the farming is simply better. I guess i worded it wrong :p
---
Well as a mage your class is quite solid for PvP play. I'm sure if you did some searching someone out there has complied videos about how Mages should approach every class and how to beat them. 
---
Yes, making sure I'm as good as I can be for launch.

There was one major change to threat mechanics later on in vanilla, notably patch 1.12. What this change did was to remove inconsistencies with threat reducing modifier interaction, pre-1.12 some were additive but after 1.12 they all became multiplicative meaning people experienced less threat reduction than previously. [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.12.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0)  
---
There was also a buff to taunt in 1.11, but given how most boss fights past the first tiers are untauntable I'm not gonna count that as a major gamechanger.  
---
It is true however, that obviously threat was an issue in retail vanilla since most tanks focused primarily on defensive stats and reaching 440 defense. Fury warriors, like rogues, had an inbuilt lower threat modifier in battle/berserker stance of 0.8, coupled with salvation and the common strategy of waiting for 5 sunders before dpsing, which most people employed, and you should've been fine on threat. That being said, seeing the absurd amounts of dps warriors are able to churn out on private servers nowadays is just a testament on how much the tanking and healing metagame has improved.  
---
Because we are.
---
They have denied us classed for a long time while the communities interest has been high.
---
While i have high hopes for classic, part of me feels like they will fuck it up somehow. Blizzard management is pretty detached from its fanbase and that was directly driven at blizzcon last year.
---
I mean, you have a phone don’t you?
---
They are using crappy Chinese games as the foundation of one of their most well loved franchises, and it will probably be rated T for teen if mobile games had ratings.
---
At least there is a proper spiritual successor to d2 (poe is dope af) but there has not been the same successor for classic wow or any of its expansions.
---
This is incorrect. Leveling a 35 takes 2 days, then by day 22/23 you will have netted your 200g back. Leveling a second character consecutively would mean 4 days for both characters to be 35, and again, an additional 20 or so days to make the return profit since each character has separate cooldowns. Adding more characters sooner is better in the long run as you are just aiming for daily cooldowns
---
yes
---
That's the kind of advice I was looking for, thank you. Maybe putting off FA is the way to go.
---
You're really underselling the effects of the 1.8 hit changes. Try gearing a DW fury at the 8% hit cap vs more, it's a massive difference. The other big change that happened later in the life of vanilla was massive increases to tank threat. Warriors as one of the only two dps classes without threat reduction (and even locks could spec Demon Mastery) were limited in their dps till that point. Not to mention that warriors rage dump of HS also has an increased threat component. It was so bad that it was common for warriors to spec Imp Cleave and use that as their spam ability when WW and BT were on cool down.
---
The second massive difference between live vanilla and private servers your missing is the time investment in leveling and gearing. This isn't a MOBA where you can drop $5 for a new character when a patch changes the meta. People weren't sleeping on warriors dps potential, it was just that by the late game when warriors became OP, it wasn't exactly easy to just level up a bunch of dps wars to 60, farm pre-raid, and get them all the dps gear they needed. Better to stick with the dps you had and were already geared. With private servers having eternal 1.12, the persistent effects of previous patch balance carrying into later patches is gone.
---
the reason they even had to introduce CRBGs was because they set the server pop to too low, due to technical limitations most likely  
---
might as well add RDF in advance since that's also one of the reasons it was added  
---
you increase the spawn rate to fix that problem, pretty simple  
---
Yeah, it seems I just haven't watched enough from the comments. I was just really hoping for someone to have a resource that would maybe show some PvP but slowed down and breaking down the play. Kind of like how in sports during intermissions they breakdown certain key moments in a game
---
Fucking crybaby warriors, it's not hard work at all. You have the easiest time finding groups, have the most control over your effectiveness thanks to optimal scaling with gear, and if you are smart and choose your quests correctly you can tear through enemies with so little downtime it's insane. 
---
Warrior leveling is only hard for warriors who constantly charge into packs of mobs or don't know when to walk away if a situation goes bad.
---
the most anti-vanilla system to exist in the game and you cheer on it, now that's sad  
---
Recent chain of events
---
1. Michael  Morhaime  (who basically was Blizzard) was rumored to be set aside due to not thinking Overwatch was ready to be a esport. These rumors and statements about Mike being pushed out at Blizzard have come from numerous people including the former head of Blizzard North who made Diablo 2. 
---
2. Mike sold a lot of his stock because he had no confidence in the company he founded and that had been hijacked.
---
[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-inc-atvi-pres-021502983.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-inc-atvi-pres-021502983.html)
---
3. Blizzard no longer has a CEO. Bobby Kotick is the CEO. He is pretty much the worst person in video games. Want to know what he's all about? Here you go. Now line this up with what happened at the end of WOTLK and forward with WoW.
---
[https://www.h3xed.com/pc-gaming/all-your-favorite-bobby-kotick-quotes-in-one-place](https://www.h3xed.com/pc-gaming/all-your-favorite-bobby-kotick-quotes-in-one-place)
---
4. (we are here). Since Mike has stepped down (looks like he was pushed out) and has zero influence, the company has fallen apart. Activision Blizzard is also facing a lot of lawsuits from their own shareholders. Keep in mind that Mike is who agreed to make Classic.
---
[https://wccftech.com/law-firms-class-action-activision-bungie/](https://wccftech.com/law-firms-class-action-activision-bungie/)
---
Summary. You have Bobby Kotick in charge who ran WoW into the ground and told you how he was going to do it in conference calls. You have Activision yes men who have replaced Mike and **Blizzard no longer has a CEO.** They have a President who has made passive aggressive comments on every Classic article attacking it, when he never even worked on Vanilla. Ion has been made the "lead" on Classic and makes decisions over people who were passionate about making it. This is a complete conflict of interest as he is the lead on modern WoW and it also harms the community who was afraid modern WoW would have resources and time taken away from it.
---
Choices Ion has made to destroy the community and timeframe already and I see no backtracking from any of this.
---
1. 4 Content patches. This is not close to enough for Vanilla WoW. Vanilla WoW does not work as an accelerated gear carousel. It worked because it wasn't like Ion's and Brack's modern game.
---
2. Dire Maul at launch. A pointless nerf to Tier 1/2 content that is already heavily nerfed due to 1.12 talents. Will also ruin the economy. 
---
3. Wrong itemization which Nostalrius did right and which they could have interns fix in a few hours, since Nost could prove them the numbers and they are all still available on internet archives of sites like Alakhazam. Nerfs content as badly or worse than DM at launch.
---
4. Shared loot, which will be used in concert with greatly nerfed instanced to destroy the community. You are going to see smaller guilds who pug half the players/sell carries in greatly nerfed content who abuse lootsharing.
---
Ion knows all of this btw. He played Classic and TBC at the high end. He knows exactly what he's doing and Classic appears to be nothing more than an accelerated timewalking event to sell the rose tinted glasses narrative that Brack stated. I expect unethical influencers like Towelliee will help sell this narrative and that these highly nerfed raids and content are what they resembled in vanilla, even though the first real raid will be Naxx.
---
5. Influencers and streamers who will be bored nad have nothing to do on nerfed PVE servers, have already tried to push for the idea of cross realm BG's and Blizzard is quiet on it. You also see it defended by upvotes on this reddit while attacking anyone who says it will destroy the community.
---
Summary. Classic is 100 percent screwed. Play a class that excels early because the vast majority of players are going to leave it and Blizzard as customers within 6 months. Hardcore players like myself will have an absurd gear edge VERY Quickly that we never had in real Vanilla. We are going to rush through all the nerfed content, ruin the economy in DM and steamroll you. 
---
The only silver lining in this is that Brack and Ion will both be fired and we will get a superior Nostalrius with accurate boss values.
---
**Prove me wrong Activision Blizzard. Try to at least try to match Nostalrius and amateurs as far as content release and itemization and I might take you seriously.**
---
Druid and Shaman both can. The only trick to hybrid farming is collecting two sets of gear: one for raid healing and one for DPS. Every good healer spec allows for significant investment into damage enhancing talents and the better your gear, the more you tend to be able to diversify your talents.
---
&gt;It's not true that Paladins were designed to be simply healers in raids.
---
Yes it was. Do you really think it's a coincident all healer-hybrids are doing much lower damage and going oom fast in raids?
---
&gt; there's no indication that blizzard didn't want Prot Paladins raiding 
---
Stop being silly... They choose not to give them a taunt and their defensive and offensive abilities proc from getting critted.
---
The hardest part about WoW is picking a name.
---
Nice hyperbole you have there.
---
Oh I’m sure that is out there, but since there are quite a few different class v class combinations I doubt there will be one single resource that covers every encounter. You’ll have to watch many different videos probably. 
---
not at all, its the same system meant to fix the same thing, population issue 
---
Your last point is a great one. Dueling, although it seems scary if you aren’t a hardcore PvPer, is arguably the best way to improve. 
---
I wouldn't expect a single video to encompass every encounter, but something like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2g1ME4dY8Q) is something I'd like. Someone going into a BG, or even WPVP, and just kind of explaining all their decisions.
---
You make a good point, the first character is returning gold while the second character is leveling. I didn't consider that.
---
#UnbanClownster2019
---
I listen to these podcasts in bed.. I like them
---
Having massive servers doesn't influence faction imbalance. The queuetimes would still exist, crossrealm would still be needed if your aim wss to decrease queuetimes.
---
I would like big servers though. I find The world to feel way more alive.
---
&gt; You're creating a problem by not having progressive itemisation, thicko.
---
The problem exists already because of talents not being progressive, dumbass. Please refrain from further retardation.
---
Casuals don't really even need to read guides I think. The lvl 50 casual lock sees the chat of a lvl 60 lock in their guildchat "ouch, &lt;xxx&gt; didn't drop AGAIN!" and asks "is it good? Should I go for it when I'm 60?" and that lvl 60 lock goes "Yes, it's BiS for a lock!"... And the casual learned something to do at 60: going for that same item.
---
It will all come naturally just by playing.
---
Activision Blizzard stock up 2.7% since podcast dropped.. coincidence? I think not!
---
&gt; Wrong. More changes to the game doesn't equal more "vanilla experience" you muppet.
---
More changes can absolutely bring about a more vanilla experience in this case, as 1.12 talents are going to trivialize encounters just as much as 1.12 itemization would. Rebalancing around having both, since we're going to have both, would make the experience more vanilla like.
---
Please refrain from further retardation.
---
Unless there are specific influences on pop (like streamers, youtubers, e-celebs in general) from what we gather faction balance usually stays just fine  
---
but yea that can also be a problem since you can't do mercenary system in vanilla  
---
They could be great, and long episodes is certainly a pod style that exists, but, personally, my bar is really high for just a one hour episode pod, and 2-3 hours is just out of the question. 
---
Just roll cheese PoM Pyro spec gg 
---
One thing we will all miss when Classic arrives in summer is sunlight :P
---
When the CEO has been pushed out of Blizzard who agreed to make Classic, the company no longer has a CEO and the guy that never wanted to make Classic in the first place and Ion who has a conflict of interest is making decisions on Classic?
---
None of that is sensationalist. Give me one good reason that I should believe Blizzard is even trying to make a decent Vanilla server and not just a trojan horse to sell a rose tinted glasses narrative Brack repeatedly sold.
---
If they are doing worse than Nostalrius as far as accuracy at trying to mimic a 2 year game and keep some of the progression (itemization/patches), then you have no argument. They replaced something that was something "ok" with something far worse so far.
---
If Mike was still there you would have a point. If Bobby Kotick was not the CEO I would think MAYBE it would turn out good. **Bobby Kotick is not going to let old WoW replace new WoW which has MT's tied to things like class balance and racials and esports that makes them a ton of money. Period. The guy is the worst person in video games.**
---
Here's my issue, and it's not really targeted at you which may be part of the confusion. CRBG is literal pure-vanilla #nochanges, that cannot be a point of debate. However, a person can come in and make an argument that an overall theme of vanilla is the persistent server community, and that CRBG damages that and thus should be removed in order to create a better game. That's fine, but you're now firmly planted in the changes camp and need to be honest that you are advocating for a change from pure vanilla.
---
Now you are correct, CRBG and larger server caps can both be seen as solutions to the problem of epically long BG queue times, which absolutely was a problem in vanilla pre-1.12. So we can either accept terrible queues, we can bring in CRBG which is pure vanilla but deviates from the "spirit" of vanilla, or you can advocate for much larger server populations, which is a huge change from actual vanilla with implications reaching into the entire game, not just who you see in battlegrounds. While there is a population who really do enjoy Nost-Style uberservers, many of us from Vanilla live see these excess populations as game breaking.
---
I'm talking about harnessing the various elements and aspects of your class and then specializing on top of that. Not the tuning of stuff added.
---
If you want to consider the other parts of those classes, consider this:   
---
Stealth, travel form, battle rez, innervate vs pws, regular res, mind control, group heal, priest racials.  
---
Personally a fan of all healers so it's tough for me, duo leveling shaman with my warrior bud, feral druid with my gf and priest in spare time.  
---
Priest has always been my main so I'ma spice it up a bit and mostly main shaman
---
It’s a really easy show to stop and start. I listen to it on the way to and from work so I only get like 30 min chunks at a time.  I’d still highly recommend it. 
---
yeah, or get a few guilds under their name but not make it public and wait until one of them gets world first.
---
Razor hill is a respectable village. Just sayin.
---
They need to adjust some spawnrates regardless of the server size I think. Some of the original vanilla spawnrates are just unsustainable now, like the mastery elites in stv having a 30 minute spawn. That's unacceptable nowadays. 
---
I agree that crossrealm was a vanilla feature and could be a thing, I just want them to be careful with how they implement it.
---
I do disagree though that reputation means less on the uber-servers. In fact I think the notoriety carries further. I have to admit that while I played both nostalrius and retail vanilla, the world feel SO much more alive on the megaservers and that's something I'd be reluctant to lose in retail classic.
---
Again this is just a personal preference thing for me 
---
Long-term investment, what you're saying is the same as why would I invest my money to buy a a nice house in a few year when I can buy a shitty flat now?
---
You can pay the guy powerleveling you so he doesn't "waste" his time or you could ask a friend, a guildy,... Classic wow is about socializing.
---
I don't even recognize my Subtlety Rogue as a Rogue any longer. They pruned abilities like Gouge that I had since I learned it as a level six Rogue back in 2004 -- before I had even assigned a single talent to any specialization.
---
Remember to /spit on a class designer today.
---
I remember having to load for 5 mins after every wipe because I was running it on a donated school pc. Lowest specs ever with a graphics card tossed in. WoW was special because you could run it on a toaster.
---
There's also mind quickning gem from BWL, which is the best one.
---
You usually only have one of these, the order of strength: MQG &gt; Ephemeral &gt; ZG. 
---
Since hakkar always drops heart and it's best for casters, once ZG has been out for a bit you will guaranteed have at least 1 trinket.
---
That's fine if you like it, can't really argue a person's preferences. But it absolutely is a massive change from vanilla, requires even more cascading changes like mucking about with spawn rates, and there's another large camp that finds uberserver populations gamebreaking.
---
on my server there was so much ganking ( most horde switched server with free migration ) that alliance were raiding at 8pm and horde started their raid at 9PM
---
Reminds me of ironforge. Would get stuck in there trying to do stuff otherwise.
---
The no lifers will occupy the top spots regardless, nothing will change that if they stay with the original honor system.
---
What's wrong with this solution? Bgs only during peak times and one faction having long queuetimes is only bad for the server 
---
I was commenting on the weak part. Not tuning. The adventurers and classes are undeniably stronger now. 
---
When you grind make sure it’s humanoids if you want any chance of doing it without spending gold.
---
&gt; That's like having access to all of them all the time, no compromise needed.
---
It's literally not. You are compromising per encounter and valuing what is best for that encounter.
---
And the sadness to come to your training master full of Hope but without the gold needed...
---
My life as a warrior fury levelling and dying every sessions :)
---
But it was fun !
---
There are plenty of variations of 0/30/21 Druid spec that can raid heal (with 5/5 HotW in Feral and with Nature's Swiftness from Resto). Exactly where you put your other points determines to what extent you're capable of tanking or DPSing when not healing. I like this build which should be capable of raid healing or off-tanking, tanking 5 mans easily, and soloing just fine: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxtxsczzxVxrRho](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxtxsczzxVxrRho)
---
I mean if you bothered to look you'd see the timestamps. The business part if 1 hour.
---
Priests can farm Lashers in DM east, just need to get Holy Nova, it's one point in the holy tree and it's fine to take it.  Can start farming as low as 52+ if you get power infusion for boosting AOE DPS.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR-rfNddB3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR-rfNddB3s)
---
I see a lot of commenters bothered by the length. (* I haven’t listened to this episode yet) But usually the title topic is just the first part of the show and is around a 1hr Interview. The rest of the show is comprised of other segments including funny forum posts and player memories of Vanilla. 
---
Priest and druid. Druid requires another gear set but druid dmg gear is all about stats not "epic quality". A decent cat set can be put together easily.
---
Paladins and Shamans are worse. Shockadin becomes a thing way later and it's not exactly good at farming. Shaman simply needs deep elemental talents to make lightning spells viable. In early tiers you can get away with 30/0/21 raiding but that isn't gonna work in AQ and AQ is where the best ele gear is.
---
The way you farm on Paladin or Shaman heal spec is things like jump runs with a warrior who also sucks at farming. There will be lots of warriors. Make a friend. You could alternatively just run instances which also works as a gold farm. Could also sell carries with the warrior. 
---
On my Ele I simply farm gold with the alt past tier 1 and 2 where 30/0/21 isn't really good anymore. Some guilds might not let you do that in tier 1 and 2 though. 
---
I'd say Wildstar was a very decent spiritual successor to this Vanilla-TBC era, bringing back that hardcore spirit with very difficult content, crafting, attunements, 40-man raiding, with a twist regarding playstyle but nothing major.
---
By the end of the first month of Wildstar, casual players where crying in-game and all over the forum because Carbine didn't design any easy and fast to consume content, easy 15 minutes dungeons, LFR raids and all that bullshit that retail WoW players expected to find as if it was a new standard for MMOs. Expect Wildstar was advertised as hardcore from the beginning but those people probably missed the memo.
---
If Wildstar is any indication about the modern MMOs demographic, its shut down last year is not a good sign for Classic WoW or any company that could be interested in making a new old-school MMO unfortunately.
---
What do you want to "solo farm, dps"? Any class can solo farm stuff in any spec and any gear. It's just a matter of how long time it takes to kill stuff and any healer class in any spec can do pretty good dps with dps gear for quests and dungeons.
---
A Holy paladin who spec blessing of sanctuary will get redoubt and shield specialization and can aoe farm really good.
---
The reason they even had to introduce the debuff cap was because they set the limit too low, due to technical limitations most likely.
---
See how that works?
---
I’m total opposite. I drive a patrol car all night so I have 10 hours a night and about 60 hrs a week to listen to podcasts. JOSH NEEDS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR ME!
---
Good service can demand a price.
---
As I said to another comment, my bar is just really high for long content. I usually run ~a month behind on most pods that I definitely want to listen to, which mostly fall into the 30-60 min range. Stuff I am mildly interested in gets unsubbed or deleted all the time, because there just isn’t enough time in the year to get to everything. This would have to unseat like 3-6 other subscribed pods to consume that much of my listening time. 
---
Considering Blizzards comments about the state of them and their evolution it's pretty clear that they didn't intent them to be simply healers. Nothing in the game text or lore suggests that and like you said this is a RPG with plenty of examples of such in its story
---
The quote I put above mentions the taunt situation. They clearly wanted to fix them (and others) and weren't sure how and eventually got it done later because the xpac was coming. Saying their intent was otherwise isn't true
---
So saaaane, so rational, so reasonable, I love youuuu, wanna be your buddyyyy. :) 
---
Truuuuuuue. RIP skin complexion and general health LOL
---
If you want the vanilla experience but with balanced classes, just wait for TBC classic, or play on a TBC private server. 
---
TBC is basically vanilla with the rough edges smoothed out and better raids/dungeons. 
---
No it doesn't, you're quite obviously clueless. You realise that the talents weren't just updated overnight in 1.12?
---
The reason you can't go with progressive talents is because they were incrementally upgraded during the course of vanilla. Warriors and Warlocks were the first upgraded in patch 1.6 and were in their 1.12 state at that point. Each class was then upgraded patch by patch until rogue in 1.12. Therefore the only point of the game when all class are in their final and most balanced state is patch 1.12.
---
Talents are just one aspect, armour resistsnce and hp values were adjusted throughout vanilla as well. Providing these values are pre-nerf in their respective patches then that's going to help.
---
&gt;they didn't intent them to be simply healers.
---
Yes they did.
---
The gear aspect is clutch. Don't be that idiot druid on youtube spamming moonfire in full Cenarion gear complaining about druid farming skills. Between quest gear, crafting, and random dungeon blues people don't need you can put together a solid cat form set for farming.
---
The one place I'll disagree with you is that every good healer spec allows for investment into damage, shaman are totally screwed by their healing talents. They are heavily dependent on almost all of them, particularly when working progression content where Mana Tide is vital. This is exacerbated by how bad the lower tier talents are in their other two trees, such that many shaman go well over 31 points in Resto and just pick up a few resto support skills in the other two trees.
---
The talent refreshes really did a good job of opening up the options you describe where healers can pick up extra dps talents, too bad shaman never had a real review.
---
Josh I for one love the length. As a matter of fact if you could do a 4-5 hour show I’d appreciate it. I’ll even do it with you as long as Defcamp Melderon and Tips are there
---
&gt; Is this normal at first? 
---
Yes.  It'll become more clear as you are more experienced.  Think about the first time you played a shooter long, long ago:  You knew how to shoot, I'm sure, but had no clue about what was going on in the greater meta game around you.
---
A suggestion: 
---
 First, try some duels against against similar level/geared players of various classes.  This gives you a fairly sterile situation of just you and one other person, allowing you to focus on just learning how to deal with that one class.
---
Second: Try out some BGs where pvp is the only focus and you don't have to juggle pve at the same time.
---
And it was hilarious, especially later on when they thought they were clicking on a table for health stones.
---
 #nochanges folks are delusional brainlets, that's all I have to say about them  
---
Vanilla is about the world and community you build in it, with each server having its own. Pretty sure everyone can agree on this.  
---
CRBGs are direct opposite of that. Thats why a lot of people oppose them.  
---
Personally, I dont give a damn. In best case scenario single server pop would be large and stable enough where they dont have to bother with adding CRBGs, since its not needed. CRBGs are a fix to a problem, so if there is no problem in the first place, no need to add it.   
---
CRBGs only existed for mere 5 months in vanilla, meaning most of its lifetime they weren't there. 
---
So even if we go with #nochanges , CRBGs should be introduced 2 months after Naxx has been out. 
---
Most of retail vanilla servers were ghosttowns after the initial waves of players because pop was so low. Higher population per server is very much in "spirit", like you mention, of vanilla (while CRBGs are complete opposite).  
---
Now of course having 15k people on a single server/world is too much, but having mere 3k is also nothing which brings heaps of other issues.   
---
Low pop was so gamebreaking they had to introduce CRBGs, so "uber pop" being gamebreaking thing is not exactly something new. Especially since it can be very easily dealt with with slight spawn timer changes.  
---
Yeah, a remake. Overwatch was a full fledged new IP.
---
I was in this guild on my mage!
---
I don't see myself on the screenshot though : (
---
Also money investment. 5 accounts with 15$ monthly cost 
---
If he rapes everyone? 
---
Real talk, red BM mid-40s pets can solo new level 60 clothies. It's like fighting an elite mid-40s NPC that moves faster than you and can't be CC'd.
---
Only difference i'd put in is seperating Dm from launch, sure the mounts are nice but the gear is particularly strong at launch.
---
It also gives access to some very op goldfarming methods.
---
I'd also like to see worldboss patches separated since they're amazing launch events in themselves.
---
Shockadin and smite priests aren't a thing for starters.
---
And it depends on what level of raiding you're talking about.
---
ZG and MC are pretty fricken easy, if you're with a half way decent guild/group you can throw on a heal set as a shadow priest and do just fine so long as you have some mana pots ready. 
---
For BWL progression that's not going to cut it you'll want to spec properly until it's on easy farm. 
---
Yea, that's exactly how it worked.  
---
Due to technical and resource issue, debuff limit was set to low and gradually increased over time when they could deal with it, as said by Ion.  
---
&lt;Third Shift All-stars&gt;
---
Links? 
---
I'm not underselling the 1.8 hit changes at all. It primarily affects fury warriors when they're reaching their white-hit crit cap which is unachievable without getting world buffs. It is commonly known that crit&gt;hit, which is why fury warriors on private servers prioritize getting more crit over hit unless they're aiming for a set with full world buffs. Getting past the soft hitcap is for that reason not worth it in preraid gear, since it means you're sacrificing more important stats, and once you're at the late BWL/early AQ level you'll be sitting naturally at like 11-12% hit just from wearing the bis pieces.

Tank threat is a fair point, but only because it was a self-imposed issue of people being significantly worse at the game. Shield Slam got better threat per rage in 1.11 and taunt got a buff as well, but on the other hand different threat modifiers had additive scaling vs being exclusively multiplicative in 1.12, which was a nerf to threat reduction for dps.  
---
In the end this was a comment about what fury warriors could have been instead of how they were. Yes they didn't get representation until much later vs them being meta in 1.12/classic, but the original comment was about fury warriors becoming the theoretical dominant dps until 1.11 as if that patch made it happen, when it was entirely possible way before then. Just because it wasn't like that due to the various circumstances of poor play/knowledge, already established raid groups, etc. was not the point of my comment.

MAGE WATR PLZ
---
No?
---
Honestly I think we're somewhat on the same page regarding some changes, but different in opinion. You hugely prioritize consistent server community to extend into BGs but don't really care about larger server pops. 
---
I was okay seeing people in BGs I'd never see in the real world but find higher server pops and dynamic respawn utter bullshit.
---
Not sure there's really a compromise there.
---
Sorry dude but idk what people are smoking in their replies...
---
When I hit rank 11 in vanilla retail I was playing 30-40 hours a week with a premade. 
---
I don't think you will advance past rank 9 only playing 12 hours a week but like others said it doe depend on your server and what other people are pushing. 
---
The only one exhibiting retardation here is you.  
---
There's no way changes to the game can make the game feel like what it was without those changes. 0 + 1 doesn't equal 0, muppet.
---
YES!
---
“Stuff I am mildly interested in”
---
...you filthy casual! How are you not so hyped that all things WoW Classic take up all of your life and time?!?! 
---
/s
---
Yeah druids probably have it the best (minus ressing and initial gearing in bad gear), but they are the most complicated for new players to wrap their head around. They require different gear, the way the stats work is odd where random weapons with stats are better than rank 14 weapons. Macros are also a huge deal on the class.
---
Someone should do an in depth druid guide with macros, specs, gear weighting all the weird items that make the class much better like that 40 blue leatherworking helm. 
---
Then again maybe druids like it that way and aren't giving out tips just like the rogue community. 
---
It'll be brutal regardless. I'd argue less brutal with good queues since you can slack vs pugs in some cases as a premade.
---
You're right about the kills increasing that gain but honestly I don't see it changing much for those in the middle of the pack. Their distance from the br1 stack is irrelevant to their RP gain because they'll still be within the some honour bracket.
---
Equally, it can help the casual player. If you have lower queues and limited time, you can arguably get more games in.
---
He usually has 3-4 various topics with different people joining in for each one
---
&gt; Yes and yes. I used to this, but I made sure to only re-create the toon in the middle of the night when few people were on to avoid losing the same.
---
In Diablo 2, people were running char creating bots 24/7 to snag any popular names being freed up. Probably not gonna be much of an issue with classic because nowadays they probably limit the number of attempts you can do.
---
&gt; It's incredibly impractical as it requires tons of prep time conjuring the water.
---
True, I go through like 100 water in a fast MC. But then again I do make full bags of water for healers before raids so I just abuse whatever water I have left
---
This discussion is pointless...
---
Bottom line is this: You don't want Vanilla. You want something different.
---
I want Vanilla. The vast majority of the community want Vanilla.
---
and
---
Blizzard want Vanilla.
---
&gt;First and foremost is authenticity as our goal  
---

I recognize the name Theemus :) this is Maul/Smaul
---
Look, I’m not saying there’s no way they are enjoyable, I’m just saying it’s too long for me. :) 
---
DS work if you dont have active demon.
---
I think enslave will supress the effect.
---
Is that really working?
---
It only takes one guy with a contact to another guy on the opposing side. 
---
Holy priest can heal perfectly and do dire Maul lasher farm. The best g/min available in blizzlike vanilla. 
---
It's so obnoxious, I played a warrior last private server and was decked out in gear but solo play was an absolute nightmare 90% of the time. 
---
Anytime a range class gets the jump on you your fucking toast may as well just lie down and die. and like you said just about anyone can disengage you if they don't like where the fights going..
---
It’s cause all my time is filled with MC strategycasts.
---
&gt; I was okay seeing people in BGs I'd never see in the real world but find higher server pops and dynamic respawn utter bullshit.  
---
That's because your experience is diluted due to Nost trashcan of a server that couldn't render 15 centimeters in front of you so it was as if you were playing Warcraft 3 during night, Fog of War everywhere in front of your nose. Also obviously the lag and fucked up spawn timers.  
---
All very easy to deal with for blizzard. Can't compare some shitty french trench server to multibillion dollar company's dedicated servers.  
---
\&gt; They take small companies reputation...\[and do things that prior company provably and explicitly did not.\]
---
It sounds like hyper false advertising. That prior company's name was built on it's actions, and those actions have been diminished or voided. Your new works deserve a new critique like everybody else. 
---
I feel like if it already isn't a criminal or civil liability, there probably could be a legal case for it becoming so, if it's shown to cause damages to the original company's value. 
---
Of course most people will be specced the best way. But a lot of people prefer playing other specs in vanilla due to how different the playstyles can be. 
---
Do you have any idea how hard it can be to gather 40 (regulars, nonetheless) people several nights a week? My argument was that since most guilds will struggle with that, most guilds will also accept some people in weird, sub-optimal gear, people with weird specs and even people who haven't reached lvl 60 yet. It is not a lie, it is the current situation on most private servers.
---
I guess that's the benefit of leveling as demo and getting feel domination. 0.5s cast on cooldown right?
---
Where did I say that I wanted changes for classic? You completely missed me saying I didn't want class balance for classic
---
Saying something isn't balanced doesn't mean I don't want the original game. We can be real and accept it without needing changes
---
It's not an imbalance being able to fill 2 roles...
---
Literally like 2% of the population actually enjoys tanking and wants to tank. If warriors could only tank you would see nobody playing them at all. Also they would be even worse at leveling and they would be god awful when playing solo. The game isn't balanced around raiding people need to be able to do stuff on their own. 
---
Healer classes allow you to allocate more than half of their points however you want while retaining the ability to function in endgame PvE. 
---
Well written post but your closing argument makes me think you didn't actually play vanilla, and only pservers.
---
Cross realm bgs solve way more issues than they cause, without them, premades can completely control who gets rank 14, and queue times will be awful on most realms as the majority either lean to alliance or horde. Pservers have inflated populations and people from multiple regions which give life to bgs in ways they severely lacked in vanilla.
---
Some servers would only get to play 1-4avs a week, only on weekends.
---
Then your idea of hardcore pserver players steamrolling everyone... Yeah that's going to happen no matter what, people who are already clearing content aren't going to have trouble doing it again on classic servers suddenly just because some stats on items get moved around. I remember clearing Mc as a lvl 59 shaman because my guild needed my manatide totem, minmaxing wasn't necessary in vanilla until aq. Elitest pserver mentality will be a bigger threat to classics lifespan than some bis items dropping in diremaul. 
---
I remember killing rag with you guys on Skullcrusher before my mains guild transferred to smolderthorn so must have still been on Skullcrusher for this SS. 
---
Tbc talents were also in vanilla. Lllol.
---
Only makes sense for a very fun endgame class to dominate the population. It's just the truth
---
DS only leaves when you summon a new demon and from what I've read enslaving doesn't count but I've never tried it myself.
---
Leveling is much better on the alliance side, with better starting zones unless you like orange. 
---
No, it's clearly you lol.
---
0+1 doesn't equal 0, but that's the exact situation you're proposing. 1.12 talents, and progressive itemization.
---
I'm suggesting that what we have should be 1+1-2. Adjust for what we're going to have.
---
&gt; carelessness
---
For sure.. I think even beyond just personal life stuff it's a testament to how games are played today. Everyone wants to min-max/speed-run/win. Speeding through content at breakneck speeds then wondering why there's nothing to do. Like you, really hoping I can pump the breaks and simply enjoy it!
---
TF is literally a cheat code for threat, like that weapon is truly deserving of the orange text nothing in the game comes close to doing what it does. That goes to the MT.
---
Hand of Rag is just for the prestige, it's nothing but a waste of time and gold for anyone involved in it's crafting. 
---
&gt; No it doesn't, you're quite obviously clueless. You realise that the talents weren't just updated overnight in 1.12?
---
Litterally the exact same argument can be made about the items, dumbass.
---
Lollmao🤣😂🤣😂😅ROFL😆😂😅🤣
---
Blast from the past!  Hope to see more of you guys around in classic!
---
Was Bungie even a subsidiary? 
---
Astonishing if accurate!
---
So you just want to argue for nothing? What a waste...
---
that's why he said "skilled rogue" ..
---
Yea in my current pserver guild I would say over 50% of our raiders didn't even play retail vanilla, most people started in tbc-cata. 
---
It's inherently human to 'race' a bit. Even without guides or pre-planned routes you would run to a quest hub, mindlessly accept the quests, open the map and see where all the quest spots are with the various quest add-ons. Then run to those positions and finish the quests asap etc etc.
---
There's a huge been-there-done-that vibe going on for most players. The OMG I'M BACK IN VANILLA WOW BABY! wears off quickly and it's business as usual again: Rushing to 60 as in: Not wasting too much time enjoying the scenery or reading all the stuff, not wasting too much time endlessly browsing AH for item upgrades, not accepting every invite to a dungeon by random PUGs, not going out of your way to run the umpteenth lowbie guildmember through RFC because they asked. 
---
Its Classic WoW. Not Vanilla Remastered. Have some dignity and take the L. 
---
Farm is 95% of classic raiding though
---
Do some research first please clown.
---
I have hit that wall right now on a vanilla pserver with few players online at lvl 57. No peeps for a dungeon run, so I have to do all the world quests all over the map solo. 
---
Start with a 17/0/34 frost spec. Put rank 1 blizzard on the s key. This is actually the most important button on the class in pvp as it slows and procs nova's and reveals stealth. You can't move while casting Blizzard. You never want to backpedal on a mage as side strafing moves way faster. Play zoomed out. Put level 1 frostbolt on mouse scroll down. Big fbolt on mouse scroll up. q for counterspell with a /stopcasting in it. E target mouse over sheep. Middle mouse frostnova. R for cone of cold. 
---
You now want to incorporate shift, ctrl, alt modifiers whichever you are comfortable with for remaining spells and buttons like t f g z c v b 1-5 and any additional mouse buttons you might have before that. 
---
Obviously you are going to want things like Ice block in a good place (and that has a macro as well to cancel it on a second press). I like shift mouse scroll down for scorch, for up it's my arcane missiles which is actually really important to secure kills in BG when someone is about to break line of site. I have a gaming mouse so I really can't give other keybinds. You don't need a NAGA but 3 to 4 side buttons is really nice and again you are doubling that with a shift, alt, control modiefier.
---
Other tips. You always want to take away a warriors initial charge bu putting them in combat. This can be done with detect magic or counterspell, but obviously you wouldn't use cspell in group play. Dueling is going to teach you what to silence on classes, what shields to use, what engineering trinkets to use. Example you don't silence that scorch on the frost mage. You have that spell bound to protect other trees.
---
In group play you don't need to be a great player at all. You need to use that target mouse over sheep, abuse the heck out of level 1 blizzard/frostbolt and screw over warriors and other melee. Mages are almost all utility in a BG. You can singlehandely screw over an entire AV on the bridge by Blizzarding behind parts of the bridge and watching hunters, locks and ele's annihilate people stuck in novas.
---
A common mistake I see is mages facing their sheep targets. This spell does not have a facing requirement. Neither does Blizzard. You are wasting time and taking hits or letting people catch up who shouldn't be. 
---
These are all just basics. Like I said the best teacher is dueling. 
---
Shamans are tough at first but you eventually beat them. Hunters it's if you can blink or get in close enough. It swings wildly based on how far away they are. Locks are very tough if played well. You beat everything else pretty easily, but spriests can be a pain sometimes, especially if you don't have cooldowns. There is one rogue spec that is tough to beat but most won't be playing it. You wreck hemo spec rogues. 
---
Have some intelligence and realize that those aren't mutually exclusive things.
---
Research that... shows items weren't updated all at once, some having multiple iterations over multiple patches?
---
Seriously, you are going full retard. Never go full retard.
---
If you happen to be correct, just remember enslavement can be a little risky, but it will be a significant boon to your power. Though a 10% chance is a little low, so you might be killing mobs for close to half an hour without a proc.
---
I'm actually interested to see if this works!
---
Yeah suggested number of players wasnt a thing. Back to the drawing board.
---
Wildstar shows quite well that MMOs actually need the casual crowd to sustain themselves. Hell, one of the reasons for WoW being so insanely successful was that even vanilla WoW was extremely "casual" compared to other MMOs back then. 
---
The thing is, Classic does not really need to sustain itself. Once it's released it's probably way cheaper to maintain than retail WoW because there's no balancing to be done and no new content to be developed. 
---
It's what I will do probably. Not gonna rush as in truelly rushing, but I will play 8-10h a day those first few weeks due to taking days off which will keep me in the top 20% of the server. Probably be in the group behind the pro's , but in front of the big zerg. Right where I want to be. In my guild, I will be getting freebies from the true rushers 10 levels in front of me and giving out greens to the zerg below me, making friends among them. 
---
Also the spawned mobs from engienering gets scaled with your engineering skill. So at 315 skill you are spawning level 63 mobs. (Mechanical chicken/dragon)
---
I hear good things, but I couldn't get Wildstar to run on my PoS machine. WoW ran fine. For all I know, system requirements killed Wildstar. For all any of us know, Wildstar would have gone cash-shop like WoW. 
---
Duel few times every time you go back to a city/quest hub. Gank everyone you see. Check out your cd spells. Everyclass has some neat pvp spells you rarley use in pve and bind them somewhere easy to reach. Stack stamina (bis lists while good for pve can be really shitty in pvp). Get  pvp trinket. Dont be afraid to use pots and bandages when ganking. Dispells/dempen magic can be powerfull
---
If I look at the statistics, hunters will surprisingly not be played that much. I take it you're rogue/mage or warrior?
---
Population fluctuated in vanilla. One of its devs said the 2.5k cap wasn't the absolute ceiling. For some servers it was raised to 3-4k. This was a limitation of technology, not game design as shown by them increasing the cap significantly. Idc either way. 
---
More like hunter
---
Sounds like they should be cut up better
---
You realise that I'm supporting progressive itemisation for that exact reason, right? Or is your  reading comprehension equal to that of a spastic 6 year old?
---
Yeah enslavement only lasts 5 min and the demon gains resistance after each enslavement so you can only do it so many times for each demon. It won't take too long to get the 10% proc since it works on any (non critter) creature, so even lv2 boars are fair game though, realistically, you will just have to use the lowest level creature in the zone you are in.
---
Makes sense. Something to test on the alpha/beta 
---
If you're coming to raid to play as resto but are specced elemental then sure but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about you coming to play, specced in resto but you don't have the "right" resto spec.
---
And even if that is what you were talking about, your guild would have been in the minority, the vast majority of Vanilla guilds did not for example require their resto shamans to be specced into resto a specific way.
---
Plus the subscription will be the same for both Classic and retail, so ultra casual players wil still give money to Blizzard one way or another, even if they don't enjoy one product.
---
Blizzard can pretty much test the water with this Classic experiment and see if there is a public for it or if it is an unprofitable niche without any risky money investment.
---
Yeah, but how much will Mooncloth and Arcanite Bars be worth on low pop servers with a bunch of new players? Well we don't know what the pop will be, but if it will be around 2500 then all servers will be "dead" compared to p-servers...
---
Not in classic but in WOTLK. I had graduated high school and moved to work for my dad and my cousin had a laptop and an older PC that I would play on and that PC would not let me in Dalaran at all. 
---
Time to learn to squat, gopnik! 
---
I actually got kicked from a VOA raid cause I was a mage asking for a summon instead of porting my self to Dalaran 
---
Cross realm BG's solve PVE server problems and large streamers who want my experience ruined due to their JOB. Frankly? I don't care about them. If they want to PVP they should be on a PVP server. If streamers want to PvP they can do it when their job is over, like everyone else.
---
**People on PVE servers all rolling Alliance due to stronger PVE racials and Paladins (salvation is easy mode) shouldn't have the game changed and balanced around them in PVP.** 
---
There were no problems on PvP servers. They solved themselves organically. If there was bad queue times? People rerolled. If there was no one to kill? People rerolled. I can back this up with the simple fact that TBC servers (population cares mainly about PVE) have HORRIBLE population imbalanced and Vanilla private servers simply don't. 
---
Also premades are always going to control who gets rank 14. You don't get rank 14 outside a premade. In fact all you are going to do with queues 24/7 is increase the amount of time you have to spend to get rank 14 and make it worse, because with people always having BG's up even in the middle of the night, it's going to encourage account sharing.
---
If you are not playing people from the server you play on, the community takes a major hit. This is not even arguable. You want to balance the game around PVE servers and streamers. As streamers like Asmongold says (who has argued for his stupid content and cross realm BG's)? "Fu@# em dude!" WoW biggest growth came before streamers. WoW Classic needs streamers like it needs a hole in the head.
---
&gt; Elitest pserver mentality will be a bigger threat to classics lifespan than some bis items dropping in diremaul.
---
This is true. I think there will be some more understanding communities and guilds though! It's just hard to read reddit, because Classic won't consist of only Redditors.
---
The "red" isn't about the faction colors. It's about the red circle your target gets when you select it.
---
I literally fell asleep in my chair when playing wildstar, never made it to level 10. My wife can testify lol.
---
Classic on the other hand...kept me up many late nights.
---
/spit /laugh
---
When I started trying to get better at PVP I would duel outside of Orgrimmar and after every loss I would whisper the guy that beat me for tips. The people who duel a ton know the mechanics of every class and are generally very helpful when people ask. After a few hours of that I went back to bg's and tried some of the strats people had suggested. 
---
Thank you. Thank you for enlightening us with this extremely revolutionary idea. It’s not often you see someone in this sub making such great points.
---
This video has and will change minds.
---
In all seriousness, nobody in this sub likes sharding. The only argument for sharding is for it to exist for the launch and that is it. Literally nobody has ever argued that sharding as a whole is a good idea, so can we please get an actually new discussion going on? Because it’s getting real tiring seeing the same shit nonstop.
---
If you level fast you can buy up cloth pretty cheap from people while they are still leveling.
---
The End?   
---
little did they know, this was just The Beginning.....
---
Why is this so upvoted? This is like the lowest effort post on this sub.
---
I’d prefer 5 hour long podcasts Monday through Friday from josh lol
---
For those #changes advocates who are using this post as a springboard for going back to class rebalance arguments, keep in mind that class rebalance is off the table for the foreseeable future.
---
&gt;We have don't have any plans to make any changes to any of the balance in 1.12. We're starting with 1.12 because we feel like it is the most complete and most balanced version of the game that was out in that classic period. That's why we're starting there: because we feel like it was pretty complete. I don't want to say that wouldn't listen to the community, obviously the community's passion is important and your feedback is really important and we really believe that every voice matters. So we're always listening.  
---
&gt;But we do want to make sure we get this authentic recreation. Because if you want the modern balance changes, we have those. They are in BfA. If we wanted to get what we would do today, we have what we do today -- that's available. But we don't have what we did back then. And we wanted to be able to give people back what we did back then, *especially* on things like class balance and that authentic game play experience and those authentic game play systems in the way that they worked.

 \--Brian Birmingham, Lead Software Engineer for WoW Classic 
---
That panther can fly I think.
---
Do you really raid from 8AM to 12PM? Or do you mean 8PM to 12AM?
---
I'm a fan of hots. So playing paladin was very awkward for me. I didn't enjoy it.
---
Priest and druid are more my style. 
---
Would be easier if I didn't like the races. 
---
If I played alliance I would play dwarf priest. There would be no question about that. 
---
But I will join the horde.
---
Tauren and undead are so cool. 
---
Maybe I just flip a coin or something. 
---
They are in this case. I guess its possible you haven't followed the news about classic, or you might be just retarded, who knows.  
---
The Talents, you seem to love to go back to were introduced in Vanilla. Progressive itemization was also a part of the game. What wasn't a part of the game was retuning raid encounters after each batch of catch up items.  
---
Would I mind if the bosses were "harder"? No. Do I trust them to do it without fucking it up? Also no. Go play cuphead if you want a challenge. #nochanges. Muppet.
---
Wildstar was a bug ridden joke of a game.
---
Same. On my vanilla server my gm has never played any version of retail. Her husband used to i think. That vanilla server is her first WoW experience. 
---
Cuz you end up with poopy pants
---
&gt;If you think the top suits at Activision Blizzard are a bunch of money-hungry corporate assholes who don't really care about games (hint: they probably are) then you should have no fear for Classic - they must love that there's a queue of customers stretching several times round the block waiting to buy this old product all over again.
---
yeah, but think of what those same suits will want to do to Classic to pull more money from it. those little #changes that Acti-Blizz thinks people will tolerate.
---
mark my words: there *will* be additional monetization of classic, in some form
---
That q time was your servers problem. My server never had to wait more than 5 minutes. I quit pvp when they made it cross realm. It’s just not the same and takes out the community aspect.
---
Doom procs also after a whole minute. I'm wondering if the sheer power of the Doomguard is worth all the "time-gating," required.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, becoming close to a god of war for a few minutes is extremely tantalizing, but could end up being too impractical.
---
Again though, super interested to see how this turns out.
---
Just do it a lot. It's just practice. Firstly you need to overcome any sory of nerves around fighting real people. If you aren't calm you probably won't play as well as you could and the other is just muscle memory. You don't want to be consciously thinking "this guy is casting a heal, I head to counterspell now", it will just be boom! Q (or whatever you bound it to).
---
Relax and have fun
---
Thank you for your detailed response. I've rebinded a ton of my keys already, though I did have my big Frostbolt on my "S" for PvE, I see that I may just have to fine tune some things. I'll be coming back to this comment repeatedly I think, I can't thank you enough. 
---
I had like 256MB RAM in the Beta and the Gryphon Ride from SW to Westfall was like 1FPS.
---
It is a common notion. It is a fact that the population is kinda split, though, which is why WoW tries to go midway. 
---
You are in the minority with that opinion bro, but i respect it because its simply your opinion and i don't want to change it. I can't change it. That's okay. You don't like it, i do, thanks for the conversation!
---
I feel ya brother. I enjoyed different parts of wow in different ways. I enjoy a lot about my life inside and outside video games. But there was this one special moment inside of that time of pvp in classic 49, where I was so happy and excited to play. Almost like my first "high" in video games. something I always try to catch again.
---
Blizzard is fully capable of ruining their games all on their own.
---
I know .. I usually listen to it in parts
---
In the US "cunt" is a very strong insulting word, and one many people don't use even if they say "fuck" all the time without worry. It's different in the UK, they say "cunt" all the time and it's more of a joking name you could call your friends. Not sure how it is in other places.
---
&gt;Hi everyone, I am a student who will likely only play 10-12 hours per week.
---
Hope you're not taking loans because you're about to drop out when you start playing 98 hours a week.
---
Swapping out Str/agi/stam gear for int/spr gear?
---
Are they mutually exclusive? I thought the inconsequential side character and love interest is a type of Mary Sue. 
---
And I disagree. "Not in line with her established character at all". She barely had any character. Also, good showcase of how life can change us all when trauma is received. Just look at Thrall - one attempt at shaving his head and the blade went too deep, now he is into all kind of nonsense. 
---
"Viable" is complicated in vanilla, but a Feral/Resto Druid would perform the best for a raid healing + raid DPS/farming hybrid spec (and a very capable dungeon/trash tank, too). Paladin could work as a judging-and-healing-between-swings support with their huge base utility &amp; healing. Shadow/Enh/Ele can't really contribute as raid DPS with half the talents, but Priest and Shaman can dedicate some points into farming talents and still raid heal easily. Talents in vanilla aren't rigid and over centralized, so while you always have the choice to pool all of your points into one role, you can almost always create a hybrid spec that gets you the best of both worlds in whatever content you're personally focused on
---
I'm probably doing troll because I want to be a less common race and shadowguard is amazing for blackout procs, not to mention beserk and hex. Dwarf would be my go to for Alli regardless of racials. Personally love hots too, if I raid with the druid after tier 1 I plan on going resto after being feral. Mostly gonna collect all types of gear as a druid tho! Hmm maybe I should just main druid? Lol
---
Queue times were a problem for at least one faction on almost every single server, hence why they introduced battlegroups. The number of people per faction queueing on a single server is almost never going to be even. So if you had 5 minute queues consistently than more than likely the enemy faction had 30+ minute queues consistently. 
---
Yeah same
---
Warlocks can realistically take on 3 creatures at a time so it should only take between 1 - 4 minutes to get a Doomguard proc, DS, and then Enslave Demon. Less if the enemies are weak, more if they are on the strong side.
---
I think a Dranei mage was the first mage I tried playing, so I don't think I got to experience that treat.
---
Nice, thanks:)
---
Ranked to 11 recently (guess the server...). First I played those 10-20 hours casually up to around Rank 9. Then I had to go hard and pushed around 35-40h per week for 4 weeks, which landed me on rank 11. This was with the top premade at the time, so honor came fast. Last 4 weeks was mid-high bracket 3 (read the wiki on bracket explanations). I had too much irl to gain anything for 2 resets so I had to play to "beat my decay" (go +-0).
---
Basically, I ranked for ~3 months, actively, 10-20 hours per week and then upwards 40 hours per week the last month, to get to 11. Your goal of rank 10 is doable but I also strongly suggest what others have mentioned, free up time to play more from rank 8 onwards. Break the grind before it breaks you.
---
To your last point and I've said it before places as well... while I want to support indie devs... I just dont like 99% of indie games out there. I dont like platformers, I dont like rogue-likes, I don't like puzzlers, I play RPGs and strategy games, and they need to be aesthetically pleasing to me. Larian (I think they are considered an indie?) Absolitely smashed it out of the park for me with divinity original sin series, but that is the such rare exception to so many types of games that disinterest me. Unfortunately, for the games I like to play, I have to turn to AAA.
---
Same infrastructure does not mean same configuration unless they covered this.  14 year old servers could handle WoW pretty decently, hard to imagine they can't optimize it better when they know the end goal and what to expect.
---
It's a bad thing because when the original makers of classic started to develop the game they were gamer's themself and wanted to make a game for themselves to play. Now Activision is board of directors (if you listen to the podcast) is run by outsiders who just care about money. They will want a minimum invest for maximum gain which isn't always what you want. They could make the wow launch as it use to be with 1.0 to 1.12 on the old client and working to make program structures around it to protect it more and integrate some sort of battle.net log in. But this cost to much money so blizzard has to opt for the cheaper way. It's all controlled by money in the end. Sharding, loot trading, and other things are a way make it cheaper and get more profit out of it.
---
Yep haha 
---
yes, especially the children since he's into games
---
Also they can pve and pvp with the same spec without it being a big deal!
---
Easily the best casual class.
---
Level up easily, do whatever, grab some random pve gear and join MC pugs or a casual guild, your job can be achieved without much gear anyway.
---
This is very accurate.
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that they're not forced to create too many realms at launch. It allows you to stay true to the Vanilla-like population cap by temporarily cloning each realm (on a zone-by-zone basis) as many times as necessary in order to handle the initial flood of players.
---
So why not just create more realms at launch?
---
Because it dilutes the population six months later when all the tourists leave, resulting in low populations across the board—and leading to incredibly destructive realm-mergers (say goodbye to your name / guild's name, amongst other cultural/ranking issues.)
---
&gt;From 2005 to 2010, Activision released 20 games in the Guitar Hero franchise but Blizzard released just one game: StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty.
---
I guess expansions don't count, because TBC came out in 2007, Wrath in 2008, and Cata in 2010.
---
This is the exact reason why I wish Rag pushed out his original amount of sons.  
---
Private servers who run off of donations do it, it's not a lot of work at all it's changing a few database values here and there lol
---
Pet stats don't scale at all with warlock stats in Vanilla.
---
Ever heard of opinions
---
Ok, just save up some gold for the inevitable respec ;)
---
upvoted for use of 'chub' 
---
Exactly.
---
I wonder if the AAA companies just can't create innovative games for a reason. Usually it's the indie companies that come up with new and interesting stuff. 
---
This makes a lot of sense to me.  Seems the best way to handle launch.  If u had to guess what level will they need to go up to before they stop shardi lng?
---
Demo is a primo leveling spec for sure, being able to sac vw and pull out the appropriate pet is, great
---
It was a lot of damage but not a 'single hit' crit of damage. Reckoning is an extra attack per charge and originally had no limit to the amount of charges you could store. Sit Critting to get 2,000+ stacks and then instantly do 2,000 auto attacks. 
---
It's a little disheartening how useless you are as the hunter. Your pet does it all. I got attacked by a warlock 6 levels higher than me in Tanaris. I was able to pop BW and get my pet on him before he feared me. My pet owl killed him before I got out of the fear. I didn't deserve that kill.
---
Yeah, the word pruned is debatable, and you're right that it's more of a feeling thing than a technical thing. I guess what I mean by pruned is that retail made it so that every class had to have some kind of rotation at all times, no matter what.
---
That necessitated a *kind* of bloat that you don't see in Vanilla 
---
Well I guess we should lay out what better means huh lol. In the case of the horde side. The Barrens is the best lain out early quest zone in the game. Horde early leveling while less pretty. Is far more effectively set up to level easier. 
---
As far as it being less pretty. I think for most people this is objectively true. The old knights tale art style of many early alliance zone are undoubtedly cool. As a teen I was always jealous of the Alliance and, their zones.
---
That being said at 30. I find all of that to be played out and pedestrian. I'm not saying I'm too mature for it. That would be stupid. I just mean I have seen that before over and, over. The Barrens though orange as it is. Has it's own charm with the oasis's and, all the buttes. It's nothing you ever see any where else. I feel the same way about Orgrimar VS. Stormwind. Obviously the Alliance one is going to be the popular city, but what other city is what other game looks like Orgrimar? At least for my money Horde is the way cooler faction in classic.
---
What other pods do you listen to? Top 5?
---
Are you going to PvP exclusively in those 10-12 hours? If not, you're SoL
---
It's why I prefer TBC to classic.  TBC has it's own issues in the long run - chiefly by forcing everyone onto a small continent and making the majority of the land mass in the game not as relevant at max level.  But the classes had so many more options while maintaining the hardcore aspects (rep grinds, long attunements, difficult dungeons, etc.).  There are fewer options per class in vanilla
---
Right, but that's neither here nor there.
---
There's a huge difference between a PvP Disc build and a PvP Shadow Priest build.
---
So the idea that you can allocate those points “however you want” is kind of a misnomer. You're picking one of those two builds whether you want to or not.
---
I'm so tired of seeing people say "I can only play 10+ hours a week".
---
Then we'll be forced to the outside world for good. We can't let that happen. (Cut off his pp.)
---
You don't have to do it if you don't want to- that's the easy answer!
---
Streamers that play all day are a bad example.  If they are making money, then they're literally getting paid AND if they stop, they're less likely to retain their viewers so they want to keep it going. 
---
I'd say basic self-care is important.  Are you drinking enough water / eating sufficiently?  Are your eyes in good shape?  Eye strain is a very common way people get headaches.  
---
I raided with him, he was pretty chill albeit he wasn't the raid leader, as long as i only fearwarded him out of the rogues 
---
I dont. I play way more casually than i did in my youth to make room for other things in my life. My body hurts from sittin for too long too so i have to do something else anyway.
---
I suggest doing physical things in your off time. It helps with how sore you get from being idle. Also drink water. Trying to power through with caffeine can give headaches.
---
I couldn't say. I think by Redridge / Barrens / Silverpine / Ashenvale people should be sufficiently spread out, but that's just my guess.
---
Levels 18-20+?
---
I knew about tanking/healing,  but i tanked with a 2 hander as arms until brd.  So yeah, I was bad.
---
I think wildstar was missing good lore.  I thought its UI was crap too. It had the foundations of a great game but it seemed to have something missing to make it into a huge blockbuster. It might have been the timing, it came out on the tail end of the huge mmo boom and everyone was sick of crappy MMOs coming out trying to be the next wow killer. 
---
Should probably get my eyes checked. I sit pretty close to a laptop. I drink lots of water. Probably bad eyesight causing headaches I guess.
---
A few things I think help a lot
---
- get a mod that shows what enemies are casting. If not you'll find yourself getting feared as a druid, counterspelling the wrong thing, being awful at dodging nades, etc
---
- look up guides for your class. That's how I found my favorite fd/trap macro and learned how to jump/spin/shoot. Most classes have little things you wouldn't think to do, like using distraction to mess up a cone of cold, or deviate delights to hide druid form
---
- you don't necessarily have to level every class, but at least get an understanding of what their abilities do. An example is seeing a shaman toss out a grounding totem when anticipating a freezing trap. I scatter, kill the totem with my pet, then trap him. Or getting devouring plague on you and knowing you can stoneform it away
---
- look at your combat logs. Sometimes you'll go back and realize you weren't paying attention and got wrecked by retaliation or something similar.
---
- get engineering. There is no debate at all about it being the best pvp profession. Alchemy comes in second, but you can buy all that shit
---
- just be patient and pvp a lot. Duel classes you aren't good at, especially if you are losing to a class you are supposed to have an advantage over in 1v1. The best way to learn is to simply do it a lot. 
---
I think you're the delusional person.  It will bring millions of the original players back who haven't played mmo's in years for that nostalgia feeling and also give current retail players something "new" to try out.  Will it last, who knows.  Just my two cents, you sound like a prick
---
dOnT yOu HaVe EaRs?
---
One major problem with Wildstar is it was considerably MORE hardcore than Vanilla WoW. It did not have a steady difficulty curve. Leveling was fun, the handful of dungeons were fun, then after that you hit a wall of very difficult content. 
---
It'd be like if Vanilla had UBRS then Naxx and nothing in between. Until that, I really enjoyed the game.
---
PvP was also simply dumb with their skill system IMO, so there was no real endgame content for me, and I was a moderately "hardcore" player. 
---
A realm with Method and it's infrastructure verses a separate realm with a private server guild, who's honestly unlocking the gates of AQ first?  Who's legitimately walking into Naxx with 8 thunderfurys?  How insane would a private server guild be to roll on the same realm as Method with the temptation there to have their players sniped.
---
Thats a little later than i would hope but certainly way better than low pop servers throughout a few months after launch. 
---
/thank for when someone buffs you and /wave when you buff and they thank you
---
&gt;We also show violence but god forbid someone sees a nip*le
---
Censor that filth in future!
---
The sounds when casting a healing holy spell like Holy Light or a nature spell like Healing Touch are amazing to me. The *woosh* from holy and the juicy roots from nature based stuff are something I'll never get tired of.
---
The combat logs is a great tip I hadn't heard so far. Thank you for your input!
---
Paladin can go [21 Holy 30 Ret](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxoZZVfotrcq). Your DPS will never be comparable to pure DPS classes, but it's good enough for farming, PvP and casual raiding.
---
As long as you pick up holy nova. You can farm DM on a priest. As far as I know by far the best way to make money as a healer.
---
lmao have you not been paying attention to their development at all? None of the older databases will move over and require reworking. 
---
If they're not going to rework older databases (which they don't have) image the guy having to go through the database and change thousand and thousands of SQL records just so the itemization is different for every fake patch they push out. Not to mention if they go that route we're going to have items from previous patches while the talents, skills and mobs are balanced for 1.12.1.
---
I don't think you've worked within SQL before or worked on a very large project.
---
Yeah, found that out shortly after posting
---
It's actually surprisingly quick to get to level 15. If you play consistently for four to six hours at launch you'll be able to hit 15 in Westfall / Northern Barrens / Silverpine by the end of the day.
---
I just can't imagine they'll *only* shard Northshire / Valley of Trials, for example. You'll still have a huge mass of people slamming Elwynn Forest / Razor Hill within the hour.
---
If the game is good, you don't need to motivate yourself, apart from farming it is not a chore. If you feel that way about a game and need to motivate yourself to play all the time then you should stop playing. Classic is where WoW's community is at it's strongest, just finding some friends to play with and a nice guild is a lot of motivation in itself. I don't think most people sit down with the mindset "I'm going to play for 5+ hours" They just sit down to play the game, and if they end up playing for that long it's because they lost track of time.
---
Gotcha.  Been a long time since i leveeled without the xp boost gear.  Forgot how quick u got to 15 in vanilla.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
Eat healthy, work out 2-3 days a week, get enough sleep, consume stimulants like caffeine/amphetamines/cocaine?
---
Paladin - 21 Holy 30 Retribution.
---
This is almost the cookie cutter Ret spec, and grabs every single DPS-boosting talent from the Ret tree, as well as all the important talents you need for raid healing as a Holy Paladin - namely Illumination, Divine Favor, Divine Intellect and 12% healing boost.
---
This build can Heal nearly as effectively as a pure Holydin, as it only misses 5% passive spell crit from a pure holy build (plus imp BoW which another Holydin can give you and holy shock which isnt vital).
---
In addition you will probably take improved BoMight which many raiding holydins wont have, which can alone justify your slightly different healing build.
---
This build is perhaps the best Hybrid I know of - it can DPS as well as pure ret and heal raids perfectly effectively at only a tiny bit less efficiency than a nothing-but-a-healer build.
---
As I got a bit older I noticed I was getting headaches due to sitting in the dark. The contrast of screen light to dark background was too stark.
---
Turn on a lamp or something to put some backlight behind your monitor, force yourself to have good posture, and listen to podcasts while you're grinding, it helps reduce fatigue for me. 
---
It's not just the draw distances and lag. There was nowhere to go and just be in the world. There's no technical solution for maintaining that feeling of being out somewhere far from town while simultaneously shoving more people into the same size of space.
---
Live to win!
---
Holy smokes at launch day i will play this episode on repeat. 
---
Really doesn't mean anything, there were also "no plans to rerelease classic wow".
---
 until there was.
---
 Everybody is holding up the things they have said like a kid who hides under the sheets from monsters. If anybody They are gonna do what makes them the most money at the end of the day. These quotes don't protect classic any more than the kids sheet.
---
Realistically if you can go hard on the weekends towards the end there's no reason you wouldn't be able to hit rank 12. It would just take a long time for you to get there.
---
13 and 14 are the only ranks where you really need to hit that top 1% the rest can be done casually over long periods of time.
---
I don't, I play a couple hours, go do something like play drums or stuff, then come back later.
---
When raiding I can usually do that long but I'm typically writing code between pulls which helps me from burning out from doing nothing but playing wow
---
I second podcasts over music, They keep you engaged and actively listening. Plus you learn some cool stuff.
---
I recommend : 
---
The dollop. Super cool one off episodes picking cool figures and facts from history. Very funny too.
---
Spittin Chiclets: If you are a hockey fan.
---
Jeff Kaplan remains my last bastion of Blizzard trust.  I'd love to see his consistency recognized, but at this point it wouldn't surprise me if he has eyes on starting his own studio.
---
Nominated for anger management:-P
---
Most healing classes have some type of farm that is fairly conducive to their abilities.
---
As far as true hybrid specs, the most interesting example is probably Eleresto Shaman. This spec goes down to Nature’s Swiftness in the Resto tree and puts the remaining talents into Elemental. It’s primarily a PvP spec and it requires a lot of gear to work, but it gives you reliable burst damage as well as the ability to play more of a healing role.
---
Obviously this spec will be outperformed in raids by pure Resto spec and more serious guilds don’t bring Shamans to raids as DPS.
---
Im glad our conversation is over because I found you highly unenjoyable to talk to.
---
Only a lady nipple though. Bronips are fine. 
---
Likewise 
---
I want to play as a priest and raid only MC ZG easy stuff. But as a priest I'll probably have to be fully dedicated to the raid block of time. By the end of a 4 hour MC run my healing won't be so hot. and add in wipes and my motivation to keep running just goes out the window. Its like the headache intensifies every time a wipe occurs lol. 
---
5.0 feet ≈ 1.5 metres ^(1 foot ≈ 0.3m)
---
I like this Idea. My idea for something like this was Off peak hour battle groups. If you make a battle group for 2am people. The pop will still be low enough that they learn peoples names.
---
In BWL, you can get a trinket named Black Book , it doubles your demons damage  for 30 seconds , it's a fun item in pvp, but not good enough for serious pvp, but fun to play around with 
---
As a caster the most important thing for you to learn is how to juke interrupts. Don't openly freecast if you know an interrupt is coming. Start a spell, move to cancel so they waste their interrupt and the continue to kite.
---
Physio here. A more common cause to headaches is tight neck mucles. They can refer pain to the head, giving you a feeling of headaches.  Locked joints may cause the same syptoms. 
---
Look up cervical mobility exercises on youtube and do some stretching of the trapezius mucle. 
---
The game is supposed to be a leasure activity, you don't have to convince yourself to keep playing, or find motivation to do so. The game itself should be that motivation. Just play while you are having fun, and stop when you aren't. Unless you are a streamer, this isn't your job, so just have fun with it. If that makes you take 1 year to lvl 60, so be it. Just enjoy your time.
---
What you need is experience, you need to do some duel or battleground and focus a little. Try to see what each class try to use against you, you will notice a few abilities that you might have a hard time against, think about them, how can you counter it ? Is there a cast time ? Then maybe counterspell/stun. Is there a cool down ? If he isn't spamming it, chance are that yes. How long is the cool down ? Do you have any abilities or cooldown to avoid it or tank it ? Is there a requirement on that spell ? (like rogue combo point needed for a stun) Then maybe try to predict that. Is there a range requirement ? Then maybe you can avoid it by staying closer or further from your target.
---
You need experience, go on and fight some class, each time you fight, try to understand what he used, try to think what you could have used and next time you encounter the same class use this knowledge to try to get closer to a win until you can win.
---
You will lose a lot and that's fine, each time you lose you will learn something so you will learn a lot. You will think "hmmm he did that, may i should have done this to avoid it", then next time you will do it, lose again and think "hmm after i did that to avoid this, he was able to get me with this so i should change strategy or maybe do that" etc... 
---
Thanks i need pics tho
---
Yes, that is why I specified that rebalance is extremely unlikely to happen in the "foreseeable future".  The time interval from the last "no legacy server" statement from Blizzard to the launch of Classic is years.
---
The idea that there will be too many warriors at launch and we will get class overhaul a few month later in patch 1.13.2 is wishful thinking (for #changes).
---
As others have said, depends a lot on server size. On Nost r10 was stupid easy because there were thousands upon thousands of players in the PvP standings each week so the brackets were inflated.
---
If Blizz gives us 3000-4000 player cap servers like most are expecting, it will be more difficult to hit r10 than it is on the huge priv servers
---
Thanks for the knowledge
---
LOL, you really got me there :')
---
Depends where you are. In the US, the C-word is an extremely derogatory term for women. Of all the profanities you could use, you'd probably want to avoid using the C-word, especially as a man, just as you would avoid using the N-Word as a white person. While the two are not entirely equatable, it's the best example I could think of. 
---
In the UK, Australia, etc. it has an entirely more casual meaning and gets thrown around much more in comedic or sarcastic context. It seems to be a lot similar to just calling someone an asshole.
---
Because, unlike economists are often forced to think, "money" isn't, and shouldn't be, the driving force behind the exchange. Money exchanging hands isn't necessarily evil in itself (though there are some historical figures who'd disagree with that statement), but it becomes an issue if it's the sole reason for things happening. At the very least so in the entertainment industry.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
Blizzard devs should be making WoW Classic because they want to recreate that experience for thousands of enthusiastic fans. The fact that it'll get them an income is their business case.
---
I would recommend you just do duels versus various classes repeatedly.  Gradually you will learn about the various abilities/talents to watch out for and learn how to counter them. 
---
You mention you're a mage.  Here's an example. 
---
Vs rogues-
---
Very basic stuff, try rank 1 arcane explosion or rank 1 blizzard where you think he might be to pop him out of stealth.  If you do get him out, your use of blink is VERY important to get out of stuns.  Generally, you can either blink during cheap shot (initial stun) or kidney shot (longer stun).  The rogue will try to vanish to get out of combat, if he does try to do rank 1 blizzard where you just saw him and in which direction you saw him going to try and pop him back out. 
---
If he gets on you, frost nova, cone of cold, blink to try and maintain distance.  Rank 1 frostbolt is also very helpful to keep him in combat and prevent restealth.  Rank 1 fb is only a 1 second cast if you are frost spec and do your talents for PVP.  It also provides the important debuff to slow movement speed. 
---
SO there's one example of fighting rogues, some basic tips. 
---
In larger groups, the basic idea of "stay out of direct harm, and spam frostbolts at the enemy" is pretty solid.  Pick a target, and try to do damage to them.  Have counterspell ready if it's a caster- if you successfully counterspell anyone while they are casting that is extremely effective.  10 second lockout is HUGE especially if it's a healer. 
---
It really just takes practice and learning from mistakes.  It can be intimidating to start when you feel everyone else is so much better but really, just forget about it and try to have fun.  Get into WSG, follow around with other players and try to be helpful.  Use frostbolts to do damage and also slow down melee attackers off of your allies.  Keep in mind your abilities to safe yourself (frost nova, COC, blink, ice barrier) and rotate through them when you're in trouble to try and neutralize your melee attacker. 
---
If a caster is attacking you, try to get the upper hand by using sheep, counterspell, ice barrier, or frost/fire ward.  Blink away and run if you don't get a good opener and are at a disadvantage.  
---
Yes, one of the things many newer wow players will hate about classic compared to the new game is that the "rotation" didn't really exist yet as an idea. That isn't to say no class had one. It's just this is back when 60% of your damage could be from auto attacks.
---
I personally like this simpler old style of play better. As for me wow is more about the adventure then it is about the "skill" it takes to play the class. If you want what new wow has with the almost "action" mmo feel. This will not be the game for you. It will be far too slow paced.
---
Originally, they promised three paths for advancement: dungeons, raids, and pvp.  
---
They didn't really tier their dungeons well enough to make advancing through dungeons a thing.  There was basically one tier and some of them took damn forever to accomplish, like Sanctuary of the Stormmaiden where a speed run would take you seventy five minutes.
---
They fell into the trap of TBC of having two different size raid groups needed going from the 20 man Genetic Archives to the 40 man Datascape.  Also, attunements are fine but the way they chose to do them was horrendous.  You had to get Silver Medals in all the dungeons at the time which basically meant speed runs while doing some objectives along the way, but imagine doing a 75 minute speed run of the aforementioned dungeon.  Many people quit because they wanted to raid but were prevented from doing so by these time challenges.  Hell, I was in a pretty decent guild and it still took us three weeks of spamming the same 4 dungeons over and over again to even get 20 people attuned for Genetic Archives.
---
In regards to PvP, "Have you heard of Warplots?"  That was the joke because nobody could get 40 v 40 Warplots going.  PvP was just fundamentally broken from the beginning and it led to a bunch of the pvpers quitting early.  Not to mention, telegraphs were great for most parts of the game, but if you put even 20 people into a 10 v 10, they basically became worthless because you couldn't make anything out from all the color spam.
---
What did Wildstar get right?  
---
Telegraphs in PvE are great.  WoW was at its best when we could use AVR in WotLK before Blizzard broke it.  
---
Their auction house was amazing with things like buy and sell orders, a true stock market.  Much better than anything WoW has ever had.  
---
Their raids were difficult and fun.  The first boss in Datascape was harder than anything in Vanilla WoW including Naxx but it isn't like what I understand Mythic mode is now where if one person dies, it is a wipe.  That isn't fun, but it still was 40 mans and there was added difficulty because of that.
---
The level of exploration allowed in the world was great, they gave us a double jump for a reason!  They also hid little cubes around the world for us to find that expanded upon the story when you clicked on them.  Also, there was a teleportation maze that ended up having two secret paths through it that led you to some great easter eggs.
---
Every class got a roll which was awesome because it increased the dynamics of the world and comboed well with the telegraphs to make it feel like you could actually control your character.
---
The crafting system was great because all professions were useful at all stages of the game.  
---
The interrupt based system was fun.  Every class had some number of interrupts and mobs could have some number of interrupt shields that would regenerate over time.  Some mobs and bosses would require you interrupt them from casting huge devastating abilities so you had to coordinate between people to use interrupts correctly so you didn't run out.  
---
Their housing was second to none.  Hell, I didn't think I would really use it for much but just the level of detail you could go through demanded that I do something creative so I created this jungle area with hidden paths through the trees.
---
The zones had parts filled with elites and quests that rewarded great items that basically required you to group up to accomplish which is part of what a MMO should do, encourage you to group with people.
---
Man, Wildstar was a great game.  I quit the day they announced the removal of 40 man raiding.  I wish that the developer was better and that NCSoft wasn't shit at running games.
---
How did Gordax do?
---
You have much to learn young reddit warrior
---
Banging whores always keeps me motivated no matter what life throws at me. 
---
Biggest thing you can do is self analyze your battles. 9 times out of 10 you can find something you did wrong. LEARN from your mistakes. Anticipate your enemies moves. Watch PvP videos. Know your class well, like how you can blink out of rogue cheap shot or ice block out of warlock dots.. Formulate strategies for each class. Duel often. All of this comes from experience!
---
&gt;But a lot of people prefer playing other specs in vanilla due to how different the playstyles can be.
---
Except the reality is that most people are usually running; The leveling spec. The raiding spec. The PvP spec. The farm spec and/or the dungeon spec. At the end of the day, even for doing different things than PvP or PvE, you got cookie cutter builds. How many mages do you see leveling as fire? How many Survival hunters do you see leveling? There's definitely a meta, on what specs to use for what and doing something different than following the meta is usually not seen a often. A huge majority definitely follow guides and/or word of mouth on what to do, to optimize their characters.
---
&gt; Do you have any idea how hard it can be to gather 40 (regulars,  nonetheless) people several nights a week? My argument was that since  most guilds will struggle with that, most guilds will also accept some  people in weird, sub-optimal gear, people with weird specs and even  people who haven't reached lvl 60 yet. It is not a lie, it is the  current situation on most private servers. 
---
Except most guilds don't struggle more than they have knowledge requirements. Try to show up without correct enchants for AQ 40 raids, like I did in Vanilla and you'll most likely get told to get that shit fixed. Try to do 50% less DPS than other people, without bringing anything unique to the table, and you most likely also will be told to step it up. Try to tell your guild you're constantly lagging, which is why you're dying. They're not going to put up with shit like that for long.
---
What you said is definitely a lie and not the norm on private servers. The leeway have definitely gotten smaller, because you're constantly comparing people to the majority of other people you meet and to the countless of guides which is the norm to read and know about these days. 
---
Being good at Vanilla PvP is 99% knowing exactly how other classes abilities work and knowing how to deal with them using your own abilities.
---
Examples including using rank 1 Blizzard or rank 1 cone of cold to break a Rogue’s Vanish, or Sheeping him when he pops Sprint. It’s just a fast-paced chess match where your goal is using your abilities to shut down his.
---
You can watch all the videos you want, but at the end of the day you just need to know how all classes abilities work and put in hours playing the game. Play mindfully and when you die try to figure out why and think about what you could have done differently.
---
Can totally recognize this. I can get som really nasty migrane from playing too much, which will demand immediate sleep. Sometines it hurts so much that I can’t lie down, then I have to go for a long walk after eating pain killers, after which time it usually calms down a bit.
---
For long sessions I have developed certain strategies in order to avoid this hell. For a long time after a work related burnout I had to restrict screen time, period. After a few years my brain has recuperated, but please be careful ok. 
---
Certain strategies are required, which involve moving around, getting enough high quality food and drink, turning down sound, having a larger screen further away and sitting comfortably. Or get rid of the hedphones for extended sessions. Always feel your body, should and chest muscles, basically always be body aware and relax tension, breethe well. This takes a lot of practice but very well worth it!
---
Caffeine, sugar and nicotin makes it all worse so I aim to avoid those as much as possible. Take heed and exercise regularly as they say anove!! That is definitely nb. one personally. 
---
Good luck. If you train your brain slowly extending comfortable sitting time, you’ll get those three hour sessions down without any notable brain damage, mood swings or a racing heart:-) 
---
Very well put, this actually changed my mind on the matter.
---
I get what my dr called "tension headaches" occasionally.  A mix of just putting a lot of stress on myself, drinking coffee, and not taking breaks.  I work in front of a computer screen all day (but my eyes are great).  Some basic tips, keeping the screen far enough away, and using an appropriate resolution so you don't have to strain to see small text or anything.  Some people make everything so small and then can't see it... defeats teh purpose. 
---
I feel it sometimes if I'm going too hard and don't take breaks.  Just have to walk around for 5 minutes, decompress, let my eyes and mind rest.  I get it doing WoW or other intense games sometimes like dark souls, if I'm pvping constantly or beating my head against a DS boss.  I never get it while grinding or PVE, those are generally less intense and I don't get as hyped.  
---
Be mindful of your health!
---
Rank 14 is about 1/1000 though.
---
I don't think rotations are a "fad". I do agree they are boring and, bad though. That being said as Fastizio said for people like him. It makes raiding more fun and, engaging because it gives him something to compete with other players with. I just don't see that as fun for me personally though.
---
Maybe if raids lasted a half hour I would like rotations but, as LFGUBRS said. No way in hell I wanna play simon says 3 hours straight. I wanna sit back and, spam frost bolt while I enjoy my adventure. I am much more into the idea the world does deadly things I need skill to avoid or adapt to. Just playing my guy shouldn't be a hassle but, thats just my two cents.
---
Much better approaches on Pservers results in a unblizzlike way 100% of the cases just saying 
---
Not sure where you got this from but, PVP was an afterthought. I think it was one guy at Blizz I forget his name that actually pressured the whole team into trying it. They had so much fun "pvp" made it into the final game but, it was never a core component of the game they made.
---
Battlegrounds didn't even exist for the first few months of wow. I can also tell you as someone who started playing wow coming off of playing magic and, other "pvp" style card games. I wasn't sheeping players when I first started playing. Why? As someone who started playing the game with the idea I wanted to pvp. I assumed the idea you could sheep some one for 45 seconds was so OP. I just assumed you couldn't do it. No game with any though given to pvp would ever have allowed in 45 second sheeps lol.
---
Phasing and sharding is not Vanilla Blizzlike. Just saying. Neither is the awful server performance on modern virtualization that performs about 1/4 as well as servers did in 2010.
---

---
If Classic can't do this and match decade old tech, they should cancel it and outsource it to amateurs who can.
---
About as much as you have to learn about Vanilla it seems my friend ;)
---
I actually had a lot of fun with the attunement process. Silver medals for Skullcano and SotS were really hard to get but at the same time very satisfying. As one of the few tanks of the guild I actually had to partake in the attunement of a lot of guildies but that was a really fun experience to me and one of my best WS memories. The interrupt system and tweaking your build for each dungeon based on group comp, that was great.
---
I'd say adventures were a good entry point to PvE before stepping into harder dungeons. War of the Wilds was pretty easy in my opinion and the difficulty increased gradually from there. There was a lot of good and easy to get gear in adventures, I remember speedrunning Crimelords a lot for gear early on. But even those easy adventures were too hard for most people judging by the reactions of the forum...
---
Anywhere you are, you are in the world. Unless by "world" you mean empty wasteland of nothing but you and NPCs.  
---
Can't imagine that's how game was supposed to be.  
---
Hi, the relevant section of the show in the title is 1 hour 19 mins long and starts at the 40 min mark, if you click the link you’ll get all the time stamps. My bad for not putting them in here, I usually do.
---
Unfortunately, I just don’t have the time for a TLDR - transcription of a conversation that long is pretty lengthy (and boring) work that would add about 6 hours on top of the 15 I already spend on each episode. But if anybody feels like taking it on then go nuts!
---
Well, Rank 14 is based off bracket 1 RP, which is the top 0.2% of the standing pool, meaning any given week you can have 1 rank 14 per 500 players. However in order to do this you need to be in the top 0.2% for a minimum of 3 weeks to go from r13-r14.
---
Hi thefightscene, the show runs long but is broken up into different segments with time stamps, it’s kind of like 3-4 podcasts in one. So it can be taken in smaller chunks, picking and choosing which parts appeal to you.
---
If you check raid logs all the top warriors are dw:ing though
---
You do realize this was really common back in vanilla? I remember emerald dream gold shire had the upstairs tavern rooms reserved for “intimate meetings”. There were skin mods you could install to Remove the underwear on the base models and replace the textures with genitalia. There were a lot of RPers that really got into it, and would even go to remote places to /rp weird sexual fantasies.
---
That’s why you rolled a female toon on RP servers. Free gifts, gold, portals, whatever. All you had to do was flirt a little bit and have some sexy armor on standby. Goes to prove the world of Warcraft has a lot in common with social interactions in the real world.
---
5/10 response nice try Im all done now bye
---
This article is full of misinformation. Bungie and Activivision had a publishing contract for Destiny: 3 games or 10 years, whichever comes first. 
---
Both parties decided to end the contract early. Now why would this be? Keep in mind Destiny has been doing poorly in terms of sales and users, and that the best received Destiny 2 content came from High Moon, an Activision studio. 
---
With that context things begin to make a lot more sense. Also keep in mind that Activision, unlike EA and other publishers, had an independent studio model. This means studios are free to develop how they see fit, Activision just funds the games.
---
It’s reliant on a single drop from a raid boss to continue progressing said quest. This is partially false, but it’s a very important part.
---
Yeah you guys DO have ears, right?
---
Bye
---
Hi Mr_Twinkie, if you give the show a listen to the first couple of mins you’ll hear that it’s cut up pretty meticulously. There are time stamps right there too so you can navigate to the conversations that interest you and skip the ones that don’t :)
---
I suggest you read the patch notes. Raid encounters went through plenty of balancing in vanilla.
---
No changes is dead. It was dead from the start because it was never reasonable to begin with.
---
The only meaningful discussion left to have is about what degree of change we are willing to accept and where we are willing to accept it.
---
I don't think you realize how often people were petitioning GMs for loot issues during vanilla, and how time consuming they were for the GMs doing them.
---
It would be unreasonable to expect them to spend millions of dollars per year for human loot shufflers.
---
Just solo’ed Isha Awak (27) at lvl 18 as hunter. Retardedly overpowered
---
There won't be tons of dead realms if the supposed 8 starting servers are anything to go by.
---
Cross-realm stuff only benefits low-pop realms. With nobody having had a "home" realm for a decade this time around, it's not as big of a big deal if they decide to merge some lower pop servers.
---
Shared quest drops is a meta change (much like loot trading) and shouldn't be a thing
---
I like the sound of this one. So you would have two sets of gear, a ret plate dps set and a cloth holy set?
---
How is this for solo farming?
---
Congrats on picking best race for warrior in PvP. No seriously. Although I think there's some prejudice towards PVP, having gnome racial for being kited is essential
---
But they’re the same reasons you’re saying progressive talents wouldn’t work. If those reasons are valid for one, they’re valid for the other.
---
You seem incapable of thinking critically about the positions you hold.
---
I don’t think we’ll see many 4 hour Mc runs in classic. Even now on pservers the casual guilds are clearing it way quicker than that.
---
Where’s the button to give this post 50 downvoted?
---
Before your comment gets deleted, do people do dungeons on that server? If so what dungeons? I want to test drive resto shaman before I commit to it, maybe try all the classes I'm stuck on the fence about
---
Troll has best threat for a tank, orc best DPS spec, tauren best survive. I'm glad I don't have to pick personally lol
---
Level a mage to 35, done.
---
&gt; My pet owl killed him before I got out of the fear
---
And I think that's awesome from RP point of view. You have this bad-ass loyal animal companion (that you spend so much time training and bonding with) that can totaly rip apart your enemies if they try to hurt you. 
---
All instances are scaled to 5 people.  So you get your pre raid BiS from spawn vendors and then you can run raids.  Instances specifically I would think so as well
---
Never mained warrior, I can say that you have to be super careful pulling any mobs, as you have no real escape or heal. Try finding a buddy to heal you. My buddy is going to be a warrior and I plan to make his life much easier. Howling shout(50% move speed) helps to get out of those bad situations tho
---
The thing is most people here are for #nochanges. Suggesting balancing in classic can catch some hate.
---
What?! Scaled to 5? That's insane. I want to try resto sham, disc priest and best tank so thanks that should help me decide
---
You could also be 20/0/31. Divine favor isnt a big necessity. You would have your mishmash PvE healing set and a plate PvP/soloing hybrid set (for reference the "new" PvP set is ideal for this). Str, stam and SP are your main stats. Its not an ideal spec for "pure" DPS.
---
Solo farming is OK with Consecration. You can do DME farming, but its obviously a lot slower than a mage.
---
My old guild in vanilla was a nightmare. Wiping all night long on magmadar. I don't think they ever made it into BWL.
---
Ah yes, the legendary TR VQ break-up. 
---
That lonely afternoon in duskwood fighting a green dragon and the amount of yelling and screaming going on between Ons/Haw/Zanon/and VQs MT, MockingCrow?
---
Between 80 people in vent, the madness of wiping, and the IRC aftermath it was beautiful.
---
I miss those days
---
Only an idiot would look at Progressive talents and Progressive itemisation as though they are  the same thing.
---
Progressive itemisation makes the game better by making 5man dungeons stay relevant in all patches. It also doesn't make certain raid items useless.
---
Progressive talents just straight up makes the game worse.
---
It's clowns like you that will kill classic, just like you killed retail byspouting off half baked ideas due to a lack of understanding of how the game actually works.
---
If you thing getting a blue item in a dungeon that is bis until AQ is a good idea, then i recommend a good course of shock therapy.
---
Useful knowledge, but [this article](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0)) has Rank 11 being the top 1.4% of rating points. Your standing numbers should be right, though. The reach Rank 11 on a server with 2k pop in your faction, you need to be top 28.
---
How many weeks did it take you to hit r10 at that rate?
---
What mechanics are you concentrating on in Vanilla raids? 
---
I've noticed this especially if I play on a laptop that's actually on my lap. Made the mistake of doing that while I was on holiday &amp; travelling a lot and I had a banging headache &amp; neck/back was really stiff after a couple of days.
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker went to the main and off-tanks. The threat that the weapon produced was unmatched and it was a huge benefit to your raid to give it to the tank. 
---
Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is a bit of a meme weapon. It isn’t strong enough in PvE or PvP to be used for maximized progression, so it would usually go to whoever wanted to craft it themselves. It can be very strong with multi-hit classes like Reck-bomb Paladin or Enhancement Shaman in PvP, but it is worse than many other weapons achieved in raiding. While warriors could wield it as well, it was often overlooked due to the strength of other weapons in PvP, such as Ashkandi, Greatsword of the Brotherhood.
---
Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian was more of a trophy item, as you’ve pretty much completed all of Vanilla WoW’s content by the time you’ve completed it. It was typically given to people who invested a lot of time and effort into the guild, usually a GM, Raid Leader or other Officer. The weapon itself was wonderful and an argument could be made to award it to any of the classes who had the questline available. For Warlocks, it would allow the wielder to teleport to Kharazan early in order to summon the rest of the raid should the server progress into TBC. For mages, the bonus spell crit was the highest boost to group damage when in T3 equivalent gear. For Druids, the staff was far above and beyond any other permanent item in the game for Feral dps, and still maintained the casting benefits for healing. (I’ve read that enchanted manual crowd pummelers can still surpass this weapon in great enough numbers, however the farming time Atiesh saves is well worth it if you can manage to obtain it.) For Priests, this weapon was also a large boost to healing which is hardly a detriment to the raid.
---
Well there is still a couple of months time.
---
I'm sticking to Druid right now. Or maybe test around on an instant 60 server. 
---
As long as there is no release date, I'm not going to panic.
---
Can you post a link to the spec?
---
The bits about corporate structure, in no particular order:
---
• Blizzard is a subsidiary of Activision-Blizzard, where Bungie only had a temporary publishing contract. Blizzard *could* be spun off as its own separate business, but buying it would require a huge sum of money, and this is unlikely to happen. 
---
• The board of directors and the CEO (who is on the board) establish the vision for the company, and the direction of its future. Those people are not involved in the day-to-day operations of Blizzard Entertainment. 
---
• Many subsidiaries have their own board that is separate from the parent company's board of directors. This is not the case with Blizzard Entertainment and Activision-Blizzard (Blizzard Entertainment does not have their own board).
---
• Activision-Blizzard's board of directors is comprised of a lot of non-gaming-industry folks. This can be bad and good. They can offer different perspectives and avoid conflicts of interest, but with the exception of Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly, these people don't have a ton of gaming industry experience. 
---
• Blizzard Entertainment is currently without their own CEO. Brack became president but was not given the title of CEO. This may not mean much, though.
---
• The way Morhaime is leaving his adviser role is completely normal. It was probably planned for him to step into that role on a temporary basis until he retires. 
---
• Cost cutting would like happen first in areas that are highly automatable, like GM functions. 
---
• Microtransactions can suck but are one way a company can increase revenues without increasing subscription costs. A company like Netflix is pretty much stuck having to increase their sub price (like they just did).
---
• Publicly traded companies in America are legally bound to maximize shareholder value. This is slightly different in Europe. 
---
• December 2018 was one of the worst months in history for the stock market. ATVI's 40% drop needs to be viewed in context of other factors. What would be more disconcerting is if they don't recover when the stock market does.
---
• Classic WoW is expected to give a nice boost to subscription numbers. We could conceivably see WoW back at 10+ million subs. 
---
• Diablo Immortal will probably do really well in China.
---
• Executives are looking at esports as being in a similar place to where professional sports were in the 1920s. They think there's huge room for growth here. 
---
• Nearly 90% of ATVI stock is owned by large financial institutions, like Fidelity and Vanguard. 
---
Dynamic resapwn also worked perfectly fine on the last vanilla server to launch. 
---
Play music in the background/tv. 
---
Time fly's when you play WoW.
---
With tier 2 set bonus (I think) felhunters had 400 resist to all.. With the book it could solo mages
---
I starting farming silk cloth on NW last weekend thinking it would be a good way to get gold for a mount. We are about 3 weeks into the server and silk cloth is only 40s per stack so that was kind of a waste of time for me. 
---
Which was much more fun. The fun of the game decreased gradually when they asked me to look up guides for every damn boss.
---
That had nothing to do with my original statement at all. 
---
Witchhouse artist "oOoOO" in there somewhere...
---
Bruh people want vanilla exactly the same it was but i'm with you. There would be lots of work to do to make certain specs viable.
---
Yes it does because of your weak comment.
---
Or we could just put the blame where it belongs. With Blizzard itself. They were heading down this road long before Activision was involved. We, their community, have been calling them incompetent, out of touch, lazy, and money hungry since at least WarCraft 2. (When I started playing Blizzard games.) 
---
Agreed, strongly pref BC and WotLK over vanilla. I hope we get the trilogy on repeat 
---
I sincerely wish you all the best.
---
the waiting for 5 sunders thing really took me back.
---
Definitely happened after I had quit, probably wouldn't have happened if I was still around.
---
You do realize "optimal" depends on the patch right?  Vanilla was an ever changing gaming including talents and ninja nerfs and buffs.  There was almost no +hit, spellpower, etc.  Some.  But very little.
---
I remember running around Elwyn cursing all the wolves and such and it felt like it took way longer.  I could only DoT a couple at a time just based on distance apart and leashing.
---
I've got zero real numbers just memories of getting my doomguard to terrorize goldshire taking a good chunk of time.
---
This. There is no specs in vanilla, there is classes. Paly, druid, shamy, priest = heal
---
Rogue, mage, lock, hunter = dps
---
Tanks ? Only viable is warrior.
---
Heart of the Wild spec Druid (up to HotW in Feral, Nature's Swiftness in Resto).
---
My main in Vanilla was a tailor. Fortunately, he was also a priest, so First Aid was much less useful to me, than a mage. 
---
Once I no longer needed a tier of cloth, that cloth was used to level first aid.  
---
Also, I was more focused on leveling Tailoring, because this toon was also an Enchanter and DE’ing the crafted items was extremely helpful. 
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uoxoZZEbotbcq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uoxoZZEbotbcq)   is the spec.
---
You have some options in the Ret tree - Imp BoM isnt all that great if you don't raid. You can take eye for an eye for pvp. Imp Judgement isnt all that great either due to mana constraints. Imp SotCrusader isnt really used either as generally you'll judge BoW. But you have some options at least in the bottom of the ret tree. You can take more in Parry too to generally reduce damage taken.
---
The Holy talents are pretty much fixed (some take 5% fear res instead of 1/2 LoH).
---
Personally I'd not take 31 ret as the CC skill is nowhere near as useful as Divine Favor in my opinion due to the limitations of Repentance only lasting 6 seconds and on humanoids, but it's still an okay choice.
---
He rapes but he saves
---
what counts a rare or cool name that people would be rushing to preserve?
---
Mediocre
---
The correct alternative to shared drops is dynamic respawning or sharding.
---
The information was there.  You just had to care enough to look.  No one wore BiS gear?  Vanilla wasn't a hard game to figure out by any means.  The difference is that since the private server player base is more hard core, people actually care to look.
---
But you are correct.  People make this huge deal about Naxx being mystically difficult.  It wasn't.  Punishing, yes.  However, if TBC wasn't around the corner, more guilds would have cleared it.  What also made Naxx hard was even getting there.  Between guild splits, poaching etc it made it difficult.  At the end of the day, the biggest factor to the Vanilla experience is "Time".  
---
And that's where the term "fresh" is relevant in more than one way on private servers.  Practically every guild was almost burnt out by the time Naxx hit.  Hell, I quit early TBC after Gruul.
---
It's not about the color of their name over their head?
---
OP is right, I have improved the most in PvP aftet properly binding everything. And also by understanding that in BGs, you are there mainly for the utility and slows. Let the warriors do the damage.
---
Agreed! So satisfying! I don’t understand how people don’t like it?!
---
This fucking guy just keeps on going man... jesus. How many of those changes were Blizzard balancing the encounters around the introduction of catch up mechanics? Let me answer that for you. Naxx blues were introduced in 1.11 as a catchup mechanic. In 1.11. there are only a few raid changes, the biggest one one which happens to be a nerf in AQ. There are no raid changes in 1.12.  
---
Go throw your unsubstantiated blanket statements somewhere else. Muppet.
---
Just practice. All pvp is is knowing what the other classes do and playing around it. It will take many many hours, theres no shortcut.
---
If it's a rp server, definitely ordinary names like Jim, Timothy, Rachel, ect.
---
Lore character names and stuff like Legolas, Gimli, ect
---
Stuff like What, Who, Why
---
I'm sure some people will also go with a theme for their character names like seven deadly sins, food or drink, a slightly modified version of the same name, ect
---
Holy nova/Holyfire/smite priests are pretty flexible. 
---
Elemental/restro shamans are meh. You go OOM pretty quick even if you are geared to the teeth. Better get spell power gear and down rank lightning bolt by a rank or two. I hated farming on my shaman.
---
21/30 Ret paladins can work but damage isn't reliable and you need a second gear set. Mind numbing boring. 
---
Never farmed on a druid
---
yea i was a 3 minute mage. before TBC when there were TONS of MC pugs. i would go to this guys "biggest" his name was pug every week and he liked my name so he would let me in all the time.
---
thing was i was never frost specced so i could still PVP LOL. but he had some guildies that were well geared to make up for it. 
---
didnt have to go frost spec until BWL. good times.
---
but nothing beats when i was rank 10 with MC/ZG/aq20 gear running with the best horde premade Niterz for like a month. man all the alliance were in tier 3 couldnt come close to beating us on a good day. 
---
&gt;do u guys think when classic releases that its gonna be swarming with warriors?
---
Yep, yet we're still going to be sitting looking for a tank for an hour until the Shaman buys a green shield off the ah and throws on rockbiter.
---
If you have to search for motivation to play - you seriously need to rethink what your priorities are.  If you're logged on and playing - wishing you were doing something else - FFS do that other thing you want to do.  
---
I'm not trying to be a gatekeeper here or anything, but if you don't love the game enough to play it every waking moment, then why even try to force yourself to?  I am finding myself in the same situation lately too.  I've got a nice block of time I can play, but after I log on and do a couple things, my mind starts to wander.  So I log off and do something else.  Problem solved and no shame in any of it.  
---
This is one of the few changes I want. It is nice to reorganize them based on what you are working on etc.
---
The name is locked to the account for a couple months.
---
Are you going to READ every quest too?
---
That makes sense!  Thinking back, I remember a mage named What.  Makes sense that would be a rare name haha
---
I’ve been playing with the same group of friends I bought Vanilla with, every expansion minus WoD. For many people the mysticism that was Vanilla will be gone. For new players that won’t be true, even with the game being so old they’ll be just as amazed as I was when I first logged on, not many of the older players who’s eyes aren’t covered by a 2 inch layer of grime,
---
Warriors also spend the least amount of time looking for a tank to farm dungeons to build pre-bis.  They're the one role that can get away with putting reserve on items in 5 mans or charge the group for their services. 
---
For sure! Thinking on it now other rare names would be the names of the classes or certain spells, I'm sure those'll be grabbed asap
---
The mechanics that were there at the time.
---
Yeah, survey’s have never been an accurate representation of interest, and a separate subscription isn’t going to keep the tourists out, if they have some kind of interest they’ll purchase a sub regardless. 
---
I honestly think people around here think there are going to be waaaay more servers than there are actually going to be.
---
Only an idiot wouldn’t look at them the same way, they both effectively make raid content less challenging than it was at the time it was released in vanilla by making your characters disproportionately stronger than they should be.
---
Feel free to provide a reason for your claim that progressive talents just make the game worse. But I’d suggest trying to see if I can use that argument against progressive itemization as well before you bother replying.
---
Lift weights, sleep right, eat right. 
---
The extensive rotations definitely separate the good players from the bad more, but even with spamming one button, believe it or not, good players stood out quite a bit. Or just ENOUGH, is the word I would use. Personally, I see no value in actually separating the good players from the bad massively, in an MMO, which is (or should be) primarily built for the social aspect. Keeping the gameplay simple means filling out 40 slots is not an impossible task.
---
Vanilla has quite a history of some blues being BiS over raid gear. What specifically is your objection to this not changing, mr NoChanges?
---
You have a link for the holy fire priest? Is it better for farming than the 21/30 pally?
---
Alternatively, 20/31/0 works as well. It runs a different style play, namely AoE grinding melee mobs, of which there are a number of options. If you take some time to get to know how, you can run dungeons for folks very well also. 
---
Works on the same principal. 20 points in Holy is 95% of what makes healing go vroom, but Prot really does want Holy Shield more than Ret wants Repentance. Losing Divine Favor for it isn't awesome, but it wont sink you by any means. 
---
I was 20 when my buddies and I got the game. Games back then shipped with game breaking bugs that never got fixed because they couldn’t. You just started a new game and hoped it wouldn’t happen again. As for WoW only one of my friends was even able to play the game for the first week as no one else could maintain a decent enough connection to play. After that the sailing was smooth with a few rocks here and there, but the game was definitely shipped in an unfinished state. It would continue like that for every launch until Legion. You private server babies need to go somewhere else, you’re going to poison classic. 
---
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't planning to do that. I also want to release an enslaved Doomguard in Stormwind.
---
that doesn't mean you need to have top 28 honor every single week, just means it'll take more weeks if you can play less. R10-11 is where the big spike is anyway, but R10 like the OP is talking about is easy as fuck.
---
Talking about rank 11 in a thread about rank 10 is pretty misleading considering 10-11 and 13-14 are the biggest spikes.
---
Nah Vanilla DKs were so much better.
---
Something to consider. As other people have stated while playing 10-12 hours a week. It is possible to reach rank 10 but, it will take a long time. 
---
So knowing that I would say make sure when you pick a class. You pick one that is good with that gear level. A shadow priest, hunter, or Rogue can do a lot of damage with just crappy blues. Don't play a class that needs to crit and, doesn't use AGI as a primary stat for this reason.
---
All of that being said. If you only have 10-12 hours a week. It would be much better for you to get gear through PVE. It requires far less grind investment. Show up raid twice a wee and, get your prizes. Up until AQ, you don't actually have to farm all that much to raid.
---
It won't last long in stormwind.  Guards are a decent level and some are elites.  Plenty of higher level players too.
---
Yep no scaling at all. I think that definitely was the reason you can see Hunter and Warlock early tiers giving their pets stamina and crit etc. They were trying to scale the pets power through the expansion via Set bonuses.
---
 Vanilla had cross server bgs and classic will have cross server bgs. 
---
I do realize how many tickets would be about loot.  I know that having loot sharing reduces the number of tickets generated (and GM's required) by a huge number.  Just because I don't want loot sharing does not mean I don't understand these things.  I also understand why Activision would want to institute loot sharing from a cost savings perspective.  I can hold my beliefs (and hopes) while I understand the other side of the coin too.  
---
The classic demo seemed to handle a decent amount of players together compared to retail. 
---
Hunter pets are absolutely absurd from level 30-50, and still strong at max. Not really surprising, especially with how broken owls are, but that warlock probably also played like ass.
---
The experience at max is a lot different, and even with broken pets like son of hakkar your pet is still not even half your damage as a BM hunter. I experienced this even with pre-nerf Lupos when I was a pre-raid geared BM hunter. BM pets is still insanely strong in PvP at max, but it's not going to solo a competent player.
---
And it didn’t 
---
I pvped a lot every day - at least a couple hours - and only hit 11 (nearly 12 when 2.0 hit).
---
It's not ignorance, you are making a big deal out of something that is not a problem. Just simply gate the dungeons which has better gear gear than raids. (release them after those raids not before them, creating sort of stairs for progresson) Sure, it wouldn't match well with the timeline but personally I wouldn't care, I barely know any wow lore anyway.
---
yes the other one. 
---
Anyone that is offended by curse words is an idiot. Stop giving these words power.
---
Damn josh, didn’t think you would stoop to the hype for views. Classic news really is dry. 
---
Bio, this is a very different angle to most of the stuff going around, this isn’t about the doom of Blizzard. This call analyses the corporate structure, the executive command chain, shareholder responsibility and stock price analysis.
---
How amazing would it be if some of these elite quest mobs were modified so they couldn't be cc'd in classic.  Or just random mobs in general that can't be slowed/immobilized. 
---
When you say "after the first reset" Do you mean after the first week of PVP? 
---
Wow, that's amazing. NO WAY retail will be able to do this sadly....
---
How do you play this one?  What seals/rotation do you use?  Does it burn through mana fast?  What kind of gear do you go for?
---
Frost is better for leveling because you can AoE level with improved Blizzard.
---
3.0 LK was awesome for BM Hunters, just stack +AP gear and with Bestial Wrath + Readiness you could literally run  laps around other dps classes on the meters. Then they nerfed them a couple months later, and Hunter basically sucked for the rest of the expansion - although it was possible to be ok if you stacked Armor Pen towards the end of the expansion and do ok in raids, but by them there was such a negative stigma that no pug would ever invite a Hunter...
---
TBC was ok if you just wanted a class who could do decent dps with a 1-button macro.
---
Challenge mode, level to 60 with the 0/0/0 build.
---
Seal of Casino, I like that.
---
Hunter was my main in Vanilla, but I always played MM. I decided to do BM this time around and it's just blowing me away how much I missed out on while leveling. It's going to be hard to convince myself to respec later on. I'm confident I could leave my pet on aggressive, afk, and probably come back with some dead horde laying around me.
---
Problem is I log out and then I just watch TV for 4 hours instead. Nothing productive and certainly not more entertaining then making progress on your character. 
---
Leveling or getting new gear in wow feels like progress, like you accomplished something. Watching TV feels like you shut your brain off and took a break from life. So if I have time to play wow but I waste it watching TV instead I feel bad like "Damn I could have been level 50 by now!"
---
Viability: zero
---
Forget it 
---
No, im not gonna torture myself more than neccessary
---
Leveled two classic paladins doing a pretty low-IQ mostly ret build, can confirm it worked.
---
Either prot or ret works, ret is better generally but once you’re around 50+ you can aoe pretty effectively, I’d stay away from holy leveling though.
---
Yeah I believe it, I'd have to let the Doomguard go in the right spot if I did do it.
---
I think they poke out of all helmets, like taurens horns 
---
Just get good dude =) Nah but seriously movement, timing, CC, predictability comes with experience dueling other classes. Also what do you consider high level in shooter games? I'm curious. 
---
Cuz it's a fun game
---
Yeah I hit R10 easily with pretty minimal effort. I was in a Naxx guild and mostly just pvp'd after raids.
---
Ill take hour q’s for same server bgs. I loved seeing my rivals on the horde and my friends of my faction. I played on a RP server. Things worked differently on Scarlet Crusade than other servers from everything I’ve gathered. RP servers don’t suffer from the problems pvp servers do. Since there isn’t as much world pvp we must bg for rank. That means lower q times.
---
Spriest "rotation" depends on if you get a SW:P debuff slot or not.
---
If you do: SW:P rank 1 x3 &gt; SW:P max rank &gt; mind flay spam until SW:P needs refreshed.
---
If you don't: Mind flay cancel x4 &gt; Mind Flay spam.
---
Some raids will want VE, some won't.
---
I think 10 - 12 hours  a week is not enough. Maybe if you are in a pre-made that always wins. I reached rank 9 in random battlegrounds but did quite a lot of PvP, probably a few hours of battlegrounds a day for the last few weeks/ranks. I became exalted with AV and AB in the process, and was too worn out by PvPing so much to try to go for rank 10.
---
Where the challenge is noticing how the game plays differently to having actually spent your talent points?
---
Method aren't going to bother. I would be shocked if any of the top guilds did
---
Lmao ‘secular, sane people’ 
---
Swear words aren’t used in certain places because they’re inappropriate, it has nothing to with perceived superiority of audience
---
If you’re in full Cenarion gear plus some caster rings you can do pretty decent damage. Just don’t spam Moonfire. 
---
Yeah there is a top 10 world Korean guild. However their guild culture is odd, they sort of do pug groups even at the highest level of mythic content. 
---
Shared mob loot would also attribute to gold insertion into the economy. If 5 people all get a grey that sells well thats 5x the amount of gold now entering the economy. 
---
This is an awful idea unless only the quest item is shared and nothing else. 
---
Same. I felt the content was uninspired, and the combat was not fun for some reason. PVP was not fun in the least either.
---
just thinking about my moms period now
---
Yeah, I enjoyed all the dungeon speed runs except for Swordmaiden.  Finally learning to jump over the beams and down Skullcano was awesome.  And the only adventure I really enjoyed was War of the Wilds but that just ended up becoming a cap these then win as soon as possible runs which kind of defeated the point.
---
This is nice and all but sometimes you will need to have that cross 'normal' loot, not giving us the option for it will be a disaster. Not using it that is by choice.
---
Thanks for posting here the new episode Josh. Also, I love the 3 hour length episode, really. Thank you for all your hard work! 
---
Oh it’s beautiful.
---
&gt; RP servers don’t suffer from the problems pvp servers do. Since there isn’t as much world pvp we must bg for rank. That means lower q times.
---
Sounds like you don't fundamentally understand the issue then. 
---
Queue times are not a problem for specific servers, they are a problem for a specific faction on each server. 
---
Like I said above, maybe your faction didn't have long queues but the other faction most likely did. 
---
Anyone who wants to rank has to play BG's, world pvp provides shit all honor and is only really done by rankers when they have nothing else to do while they wait in queue for 1 hour. 
---
It's not a lack of people queueing up that cause the queue times, it's that when 200 horde are trying to play wsg and only 100 alliance then the horde have to wait in line to get a chance. 
---
Glorious Banana warrior.
---
If you don't like the Night Elf ears Humans are the meta pick (On the Alliance) for warriors because of Sword and Mace specialization, I believe they also had beard options.
---
I don't think anyone used Shadowmeld to avoid ganks since the enemy could see where you disappeared and break the stealth.
---
You'll probably be able to model edit them out eventually.
---
This is my current top pick in my deliberation as well.  I feel that a good warrior is a good warrior and facials don’t matter in the end. (For PvE, as much)
---
Nope sorry. Compared to BfA, launches like wrath and TBC look perfect in comparison.
---
face it, the company is getting worse and lazier. P server people are the only ones really advocating for no changes. At least if Classic ends up like shit, I know I'll have somewhere to play a real version of the game.
---
you completely missed the reckoning/ret build
---
It's hard.
---
It'll definitely be easier if you AOE farm for leveling as that gives you tons of cloth, also on launch if you are kinda far ahead you can help your guild/friends/randoms by making bags, just asking for them to send cloth and some money for mats, and getting free skillsup that way. Just make sure you stop spending your own cloth when you are able to make new kinds of bags(so you train from helping and save cloth). 
---
Part of me wishes that they can do a small buff on prot and ret to make them viable. Not even top tier, just viable. 
---
However, I have no trust in Blizz at the moment to do something like that and not fuck it up. 
---
I just remember leveling a pally in vanilla, because the "Holy Warrior" thing got me too. But healing is boring for me. And that's all anyone ever wanted from me. So I changed classes. At least until TBC when I could at least tank. And honestly, they few times I convinced a guild or pug to let me raid as ret, I did really well. Honestly have no idea why there was so much ret hate in TBC.
---
Yes, but on the bright side, enjoy never running out of mana while going full tilt on dps.
---
^^^^^^what
---
I guess your body is not used to it anymore. I remember when I was 15 and came back from a 3 week vacation in Thailand, I had been swimming every day, walking around the town every night, etc etc.. and when I got home and sat down at the computer it felt very out of place, but I went through the feeling of being out of place and 1-2 days later everything was back to normal. I basically had to force myself to play the same game for the entire day in order to finally getting past the feeling.
---
I'm in my mid 20s now and I do my work on the computer, I watch streams on my computer and I play games on my computer. So I basically sit infront of the computer for 12h+ a day without any problems.
---
So.. give it a try, pick your main game whatever that is and force yourself to play the entire day even though you want to quit badly after a few hours. OR just play casually, it's not like you NEED to play for more than a few hours each day if you don't feel like it.
---
I'm one of those people, but I believe we are few and far between.  We've had the option to play Private for years now, just haven't.
---
I wish I would've stopped playing before TBC launched so I had my character as it was preserved back in Vanilla. Not just for the sake of preserving it either, I personally didn't like TBC as much as Vanilla. 
---
My memory of playing retail vanilla is pretty blurry but I remember tanking quite a bit of strat/scholo runs and having a lot of fun. 
---
Even appear on Druid forms. You roll a NE you get ears forever.
---
This isn't a discussion about about changing the values of items based on your expert opinion. This is a discussion about progressive itemization and scheduled content release. I guess you just gave up on that one huh... figures.  
---
As to your other question... you even suck at presenting your stupid point.  
---
There's green gear that's bis until naxx like wards with high + healing values. Bloodvine from ZG is BIS until naxx for casters. Warlock T1 is useless for pve. Wolfshead Helm is bis for feral dps until TBC, so is Lionheart. So what's my objection to this not changing? Its a part of Vanilla. And that's enough. We fought to get this game remade. You are not changing it. Go farm your welfare epics in bfa, go train your pets, go faceroll in lfr, go farm transmog and mounts or whatever it is you snowflakes do.
---
I’m really tempted to pay $15 to check my old items.
---
That is it, not the circle but the name.
---
&gt; One major problem with Wildstar is it was considerably MORE hardcore than Vanilla WoW.
---
I always try to explain this to people that didn't play Wildstar, and they jsut don't get it.
---
Imagine this:  Imagine to enter Molten Core *at all* (as in, you couldn't run through BRD) you had to do an attunement chain for every single member of your raid.  Now after a few steps, one part of said attunement chain is running *every single dungeon in the game*, but not a normal run....you have to run it as a speed run ala Strat-45...oh and also you have to do it without any deaths in your group...for every dungeon.  Then said attunement chain requires say 40 of an item PER PERSON in your raid (number may have been not exactly right).   Now further imagine that the first month or so the raid exists, the drop rate on these items is *so low* there exist only enough of them *in the entire world across all servers and factions* to attune approximately 1.5 guilds.   This is WORLD WIDE.   
---
What happened in W* was basically exactly that for the first raid.  Add on to it that one or two hardcore guilds figured this out a few weeks before the raid dropped and transferred to every server and bought up all of said item, meaning they were attuned and it was literally impossible for anyone else to attune for weeks.   Imagine if Method could *literally* lock every other raid guild in the world out of the new raid when it dropped....
---
That was wildstar hardcore.
---
as other commenters have noted, keep at it and you will improve, the "hazy" feeling of not knowing what the fuck is going on will soon pass and you'll be running on instinct/muscle memory.
---
however! read up on all the little things your class can do. I have very little experience on mages, but for example, ice block timing can win or lose a fight. newbie mages use it when they're low on health and want some breathing room, while experienced ones shed DoT and make themselves immune to fuckloads of incoming damage, then cancel it after half a second.
---
some things you can read up on, but there will be even more tricky shit that you're going to have to figure out for yourself. for example, so it doesn't seem as vague (TBC examples, 'cos I did most my pvp at that time): as a shadow priest, the internet thought me that I can get out of poly with shadow word: death's backlash damage if timed right. but no guide ever told me that if a holy paladin bubbles under pressure and tries to heal, you *shouldn't* always go for mass dispel (dispels bubble) right off the bat, instead you could just mind control their partner (2v2 arena) and watch as he slowly bleeds out from DoTs, with his healer unable to do much of anything.
---
these little, situational tricks can easily be the difference between a win and a loss, so... keep at it, have fun, and always, always try to analyze what you could have done better.
---
Oh I'm going to for sure when the time comes. I'm 99% sure I have some collectors items that sell for mad gold. If I get into a pinch and can't/don't want to pay for my subscription during Classic, I'll just sell one of those items and buy a token. 
---
Yeah, I was under this impression too. For some reason people believe it's this ongoing issue. I'd rather talk about catchp-up items or some shit. I'm not really going to interact with people much until i'm level 12 ish anyways.
---
Get 'em
---
For pvp I often play 29/0/22 disc/shadow. It doesn't do the damage of full shadow, but it's a pain to kill, has a huge mana pool, and retains silence. I'd categorize it as an offensive support build.
---
[http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsVioZZVMgz0to](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsVioZZVMgz0to)
---
Explanations:
---
**Why VE?**: There are plenty of situations in PvP where I get separated from teammates. This build is mostly support focused but having renew and VE up on a target I'm spamming mind flays on makes it a pain to take out in a 1v1 situation. It also tempts targets to kick/CS a mind flay, at which point I'm free to cast holy spells. For one point, this is all very worth it.
---
**Why 5/5 Shadow Focus?**: Frankly, I always go full 5/5. Shadow resist is very common on gear. Without buffs my priest has 40 shadow resist on her gear alone. I want to make sure my spells land.
---
**Why no Imp Inner Fire?**: This build's biggest struggle is mana problems, because it's not as efficient in healing as holy or in damage as shadow. The spells it casts the most often are PW:S, renew, SW:P, and dispel. All of those are instant casts and I rather have the points in Mental Agility. As long as you have over 4.5k-ish hp buffed (and you should be stacking stam as a priest in pvp) you shouldn't have major problems surviving.
---
As says the salty clothie
---
You'll get better use from the WotF racial in PvP than you will set up opportunity to gank in a BG.  Open world the idea isn't dumb but still not the best one.
---
Bananaman
---
Never thought of that!   
---
That's why you have to use it together with the Gnomish Invisibility gadget (not sure of exact name) but you can walk away after melding behind a tree or something (just enough to mount up and get the heck out of there).
---
I’m not the foremost authority here, but I had tried leveling a troll warrior on an unlisted server and found the PvP experience as a warrior to be awful.
---
Can’t hit them because of difficult gap closing and constantly being starved for gear means being a weakling if you’re even able to hit anything.
---
Not to mention, “miss, miss, dodge, parry, dodge, OVERPOWER... miss, dodge”. (With 3 second swing times when 2h’ing)
---
I’m a PvE guy, but there aren’t too many of those servers.  So I learned to just accept being killed over and over.
---
In short, it feels like you’re the school nerd being shoved into lockers until you level up to later levels.  (I’ve only made it to lvl 30, so take all this with a pitcher of salt)
---
Don't wanna do that :/.
---
But you can also eat while melded, I think that's pretty neat in itself. Especially when you don't have a pocket healer.
---
Pvp is where they lost me. To much craziness and normalizing is just the worst.
---
That, and the stats and equipment I found confusing.
---
Vanilla wow I could mouse over stamina and see exactly what happened if I added one stamina.
---
Wildstar I found just chaotic and hard to know what to even equip or itemize
---
Man faggot was so good, so much fun to call your buddies.
---
When they took faggot from us it was a sad day
---
warriors have a shitload of ways of getting out of fear, WotF isn't all that useful, at least compared to what some other races bring to the table - undead are regarded as one of the worse picks for pvp in case of warriors.
---
leveling to 60 is not the biggest deal... raiding until AQ40 and getting pre-naxx BIS-items is really the point where warriors start to get better than other classes. And that is way past just reaching lvl 60. pre-raid-BIS warrior just sucks or at least needs to really tryhard consumables and world buffs for PvE dmg, and for PvP you really need some skills, engineering and knowledge how to beat other class/spec combinations. 
---
But yeah, with Naxx gear and all those stolen leather items from rogues you really start to feel the higher power curve.
---
Also I don't think warriors are that OP vs other DPS-classes in PvP. Sure some cloth-users might get 1 shotted 95% of the time, but to overpower other classes warrior still needs the dedicated dispeller and healer.
---
AAAs buy indies and focus solely on cash flow often losing innovation
---
Indies either fail or succeed because they innovated.
---
So you’re kind of looking through a lense. When you think “indies” you’re only thinking of the successful ones you KNOW about BECAUSE they innovated 
---
Other than [Classic DB](https://classicdb.ch/) already mentioned, if you're into databases you can have a look at CMangos DB: https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db/tree/master/Full_DB
---
All vanilla quests are defined in the "quest_template" table.
---
You could tank or dps as a paladin 
---
Just don’t expect to tank any raids or dps anything past MC
---
Ah, don't roll warrior and don't PvP.  Cool.  Didn't know.
---
Cast Curse of Doom on a https://classicdb.ch/?item=5052
---
You completely missed the part where I said I have no clue how to make the protection tree work and was looking for advice on it.
---
You mean like Auto Loot, which will change things like AV? They have changed LOTS of things. "No changes" at this point is a fairy tale.
---
i just gave it bro chill
---
I did this on my priest from level 55-60. I tried at 54 and it was too hard. 55 was still difficult but after I got the hang of it it was quite viable.
---
Mages can pull this off at 52 but there's no way a holy priest can do this at 52.
---
Looks great! I remember so many of my guild's Warriors losing their minds when the OEB model got updated.
---
Return dps became viable in 2.4.3.  I think nihilum brought 1 ret Paladin to sunwell and zero mages.
---
The best launch was Legion, not a single hiccup. But nothing you said supports your argument in any way. Vanilla isn’t TBC or Wrath, Vanilla launch was still horrid, and nostalgia doesn’t change that. 
---
Auto Loot is in Vanilla it just requires you to hold Shift. Auto Loot by default does buff Rogue farming by quite a bit as it allows for pick pocket auto-looting but that's about it.
---
What was your characters name?
---
Probably going to have to wait for deflation to calm down, more likely than not come launch returning veteran players will come back and do that exact thing, sot he market's going to get saturated and the price will drop. I'm in it for the long haul tho, so I'll just bide my time and hang on to them for a while. 
---
I grew up doing it, and now it doesn't hurt my brain to focus for that long.
---
During the times before even Vanilla WoW— the mentality of the average gamer was indeed not to min-max but instead to immerse themselves in a world and escape from their troubles.
---
Many people that migrated to WoW came from oldschool style games / MMOs like Everquest, DAOC, UO, etc. 
---
During the earlier years of WoW there were still people hanging out at inns and taverns and such simply soaking it in and roleplaying.
---
Private servers now are indeed the niche of the niche and the players attracted to it are a very different player base.
---
This actually made me laugh. +1 👌
---
I do what I enjoy. If you find it a chore, don't do it :)
---
Except they nerfed stormstrike before it ever hit the live realms thanks to this video.
---
Something like this would do nicely.

Woh this is awesome!  You should do more of these!
---
He gave good advice but don't copy someone else's keybinds. Only rule is that you should bind keys that you can press easily. 
---
Just progressively add spells to keybinds as you level, don't hesitate to remap after you get too many spell and realise that your setup is not working great for you, but once you got everything bound, just keep it as is. Muscle memory does the rest of the work. 
---
I know for example that a lot of people use shift as a preferred modifier. I like alt instead. Your hand size and shape matters, I can't stress this enough, don't just copy someone else's keybinds, it's counter productive.
---
I was an orc warrior in Vanilla and I got super envy when inspect those Taurens with it. Much better with crusade enchant :Q\_
---
more pixels here \^\^ : [https://twitter.com/larkkkattack](https://twitter.com/larkkkattack)
---
I can’t imagine that much time to level to 60.  Unless they were hyper casual, hyper PvP, or just enjoyed socializing in SW/Org.
---
Lets see now I have my own house with no parents to tell me what to do, $2,000 desktop, gaming mouse, mechanical keyboard, headset, money for uber eats whenever I want and a near infinite supply of adderall, chew and energy drinks. So na I'm good. 
---
For me its just staying interested. I usually do that by jumping to alts now when i get frustrated with one character. Like when farming gear and not getting drops. Honestly the biggest problem i have is trying to play casually, i cant stay interested long enough, or i get fruatrated with bad drops, dying, etc. If i switch to an alt i cam refocus a bit and then go back to my main after a bit.
---
Well luckily it’s the very beginning of your life on that server, if you waste a couple hours and decide that the server version you chose isn’t for you, you aren’t giving up much to change to the other server launch experiences. At least you have the choice/option to try the others out. If there’s only one choice, for some people it will be “the wrong launch experience” and they won’t be able to switch. 
---
Blizzard could do a light suggestion to those who aren’t familiar with these launch experiences and suggest a server to them. Or give a brief explanation of each of the three. Ideally this should only be relevant for a couple weeks before all the 3+ server launch types should be reverted back to vanilla values anyways.
---
There is no strategy. If you're not motivated to play the game then don't play it. It means you're not enjoying it. you shouldn't have to motivate your self to play a video game. You should WANT to play it because you love the game. 
---
I love axes so...Arcanite reaper incoming (?)   
---
PS: ty &lt;3
---
Just go deep Ret. I'm doing math right now, and it's a no-brainer (math post incoming when its done). Ret does so much more damage, with less health / mana downtime.
---
Going holy with consecrate + holy shock, you'll be drinking after every single mob, and killing slower than ret.
---
Prot, you'll need to pull 4 mobs to match the damage of ret, but you'll eat and drink after every pull, for no increase in killing speed.
---
Those launches came before Acti-Blizz.
---
Ok, a ~~couple~~ lot of points:
---
**Seal of the Crusader**
---
Seal of the Crusader is officially broken in patch 1.12. [Here's a recent thread about it](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765876950) on the official Classic forums but I'll summarize:
---
In essences, SotC was supposed to be the “swing faster to get more procs” Seal. Unfortunately at some point around 1.9 Seal of Righteousness was changed (it's debatable whether this was intentional or a design oversight) so that the extra Holy damage component behaved mechanically as a second weapon swing.
---
This effectively makes SoR better than SotC in all cases. +40% swing speed has nothing on +100% swing speed.
---
So this is why Imp. SotC is a worthless noob-trap. Don't even buy SotC from the trainer! Remove it from all your builds.
---
**Retribution damage package**
---
The first 11 points (SoC) in Ret are the “damage” package of Paladin builds. SoC + the following 2H progression give you the highest DPS you can get. Everything else in the Ret tree is just a way of buffing this package in smaller ways.
---
Here's the 2H progression path btw:
---
* Level 18-20: Smite's Mighty Hammer
---
* Level 20-29: Verigan's Fist
---
* Level 29-34: Corpsemaker
---
* Level 34-44: Bonebiter
---
* Level 44-50: The Rockpounder
---
* Level 50: Lightforged Blade
---
* Level 51-58: Ice Barbed Spear
---
* Level 58-60: Arcanite Reaper
---
* Level 60: The Unstoppable Force
---
This damage package is so cheap and easy to get that any Paladin who is not going Prot should follow this path. This means healing with a 2H, or switching to a 1H + Healing Off-hand for dungeons. Wearing a shield as Holy is going to do very little for you. Unless you care about the aesthetic of running around with a shield.
---
**Protection build**
---
[11/33/7](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGxI0zEoVb) This is pretty much the most optimal Protection build. An important thing to note is that this build excels in high-level AoE grinding. It sucks for anything else. With this build you can take many small hits at the same time while reflecting insane amounts of damage. Consecration is *key* to this, which is why mana is going to be your biggest limitation.
---
You're totally on to something with Imp. Ret Aura and Eye for an Eye being really, really desirable for Protadins!
---
But you just can't get there without sacrificing your AoE survivability. There's a way of making a ST Protadin build—[0/32/19](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGxI0zyoVf0xMb) perhaps?—but it adds talents that don't really shine, such as Conviction and you have to sacrifice Divine Strength and Intellect, which is huge. Remember that Strength increases your amount of mitigation while blocking with a shield.
---
** Your Retribution build**
---
The build you call the Ret build, [21/0/30](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#stxu0xoZZEbotbcq) is actually what I would call the Holy/Ret hybrid because you're going out of your way to take Illumination, which basically makes you the best healer in the game, lol. IMO, what you call the Holy/Ret hybrid is just a worse version of it. Holy Shock being on a 30s CD is just not impressive in Vanilla. It has the worst HPS/HPM and many end-game HPaladins get away with skipping it. For more info [this old Vanilla Paladin blog](http://paladin-guide.blogspot.com/2006/01/mana-pool-and-healing.html) has some maths.
---
** Problems with leveling as Prot **
---
AoE-grinding is going to be *impossible* at launch. All mobs in all areas are going to be heavily contested, especially by Mages who are the AoE kings. Furthermore, AoE-grinding is really only efficient at very high levels anyway. I'm talking 50+ which specialized gear. This all changed in TBC, but during Classic don't expect to level as a Protadin by doing anything other than mediocre ST damage.
---
** Tanking dungeons as Prot while leveling **
---
The tanking effectiveness of Warriors and Druids depends almost entirely on the Warrior or Druid themselves. Paladin tanking, on the other hand, depends about 50% on the Paladin and 50% on the party.
---
This means party members need to throttle their DPS, pay extra attention to targeting down marked mobs, reducing AoE to a minimum, understanding how BoP works, preferably having a threat meter, and eventually putting up with Blessing of Salvation (something Mages especially whine about.) 
---
This sounds fun and interactive, and I’m open to the idea that in a consistent, committed guild group it could be—but I would never recommend leveling as a Protadin thinking you'll be tanking dungeons regularly.
---
** Imp. Seal of Righteousness ** 
---
It's not great. It really only adds 1-2% DPS. It's a waste of five talent points if you ask me, although one of the Protadin guide says: “This is not a talent you need to go out of your way to acquire, but if you are going further up this tree, spend your points here.”
---
&gt; The Protection tree seems to have a lot of talents and abilities that seem more like the Retribution to me - you do more damage when you take hits. This means the more enemies attacking you, the better.
---
This is the Paladin threat-mechanic in Vanilla. You don't have a Taunt. You gain threat by how much Holy damage you deal, which means all those talents that reflect damage are helping you hold aggro. It also means that talents such as Deflection and Anticipation increase your parry chance, and parrying an attack reflects *zero* Holy damage (and also reduces your chance to block with Redoubt / Holy Shield / BoSanc) which means these primary mitigation talents actually make you a worse tank. Hurray Vanilla, lol.
---
Quality content as usual Josh, great interviews! 👌
---
Reckoning isn't going to be worth squat if you can't bait a proc with /sit
---
I would go full pve ret spec, something like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxzZVhZEbbtbcqo with your first 31 points in ret and then 8 in prot for the +hit. 
---
Oh and depending on if they make any changes in classic you can switch to protection/aoe build at 56 and just grind dme lasher till 60. 
---
As an AOE grinding mage, yes, I would dynamic respawn for insane leveling speeds.
---
That's one of the best pally sets ever.
---
Err it seems that the improved enslave demon talent sucks. I’d say any coolie cutter DS build would be the way to go, then add Doomguard on top of that for spice
---
I’ll admit it’s extra work, but again this is a very polarizing subject that will effect subscription numbers. The resources it takes to pull this off isn’t huge. They’re already considering sharing as it is, and they already have claimed it’s only for launch. So they know/expect to do this anyway. The only other thing they’d need to do is tweak the respawns of Mobs on the dynamic respawn server at the time they remove sharding and then bam, they’re done.
---
Nah dude, there's items in the original vanilla wow 5mans that is updated towards the end of vanilla as catch up items which at the start of vanilla are weaker than raid loot, but by the end they're stronger than early tier raid loot - so you can see the problem if these items were in from the start. It's not gated content, it's gated item upgrades.
---
Epic Mount isn't as important as you'd think 
---
What if people had the option, and could instead choose a sharded server launch, or a classic queue server launch? That’s the discussion. Not to say that one is wrong, or that one is right. It’s to say that blizzard can give almost everyone what they want with a small amount of elbow grease.
---
Hand of Rag is also the best 2h pvp weapon in the game before MoM...
---
Kinda impossible to guess right now no?
---
Seriously like that's a cool method to maximize dps for speed clears but if you're really doing all that and burning that many consumes every single MC trash pull you should really get an actual hobby of sorts... and this is coming from someone who plays like 20+ hours a week. 
---
" Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros is a bit of a meme weapon. It isn’t strong enough in PvE or PvP to be used for maximized progression "  
---
It isn't strong in PvP? Are you joking? It's the strongest 2h weapon in the game before KT.
---
My guilds mages would have competition in who could kill it the fastest.. Most of them couldn't...
---
They were not the best mages though.. It was fun.. The black book is my all time favourite item from wow
---
It is only on quest items.
---
I think we can say for certain it will only be a fraction of what there was back in the day.
---
Honestly it sounds like you're overthinking a fun, mostly useless gimmick. You might use it once or twice successfully, but if I were you I'd pick human for the increase dps, plus the model seems like it would suit you better. 
---
Well who does Acti/Blizz listen to? They’ve got a pool of people 2% of them want this change, 4% that change, 3% this change, 7% that change, and 45% no changes. The problem with “changes” is every requested change isn’t backed by the majority of the community. Further, the crowd who’s pushed for this for years is made up of mostly the no changes crowd. 
---
Blizz has taken a stance that they intend to keep the game as authentic as possible, which is to say the 2% that must have this change or they won’t play, and the 4% that must have that change - that blizzard would suggest that vanilla is not for the people who must have their change added into classic wow.
---
I'd be pretty annoying.
---
hmm, I'd argue the opposite, I feel like the hype for classic wow - at least in the beginning - will be off the charts. Particularly with retail's recent failings. They might need a lot of servers to handle the load, or significantly increase the server capacity.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
If you know you aren't going to be able to tank raids due to scheduling, why bother trying and gearing for it? Seems like a large time and gold sink, when you look like you're fine just going fury dps.
---
It's like comparing apples and oranges, true they both have an effect on raid content - so do different hp/armour/resistance values that were adjusted throughout various points in vanilla wow. Talents are just a part of a large array of reasons why content is easier in later patches.
---
The reason that they're different is because one makes already very easy content slightly easier (talents) - the other invalidates loot from that content and renders it somewhat pointless. 
---
Why do MC/BWL when you can get AQ/Naxx patch catch up gear in a 5man? Equally, why do a 5man in a later patch when you can't get any upgrades from it. These items are great if they're released in their corresponding patches, but they're a real problem if they're released or in their endgame state at the start of the server.
---
If you are really opposed to being ganked at BRM then you should go PVE server. Hanging people at BRM is the game experience that many people are quite excited about. Sharding ruins that for that group. Luckily you have the choice of a PVE server where you can get what you want, without affecting their fun.
---
Un’goro is the same thing. I think we can all agree we don’t want to pay the prices they’re creating for devilsaur leather, but you don’t have to pay it. Simply put, they’re spending their time on something that you have no obligation to engage in. 
---
I do tend to use it more as a starting point than anything else. Like you said, hand sizes vary, not everything that's comfortable for one is comfortable for another. The big takeaway from the keybind suggestion was to have mouse scroll as a spell, I hadn't thought of that before.
---
The thing is that it would hardly make any difference. We are talking about a little extra crit, str and weapon damage...
---
Well I'm still hoping to be an offtank as I love the idea of being a tank, but I recognise that even with 75% raid reliability I'd be unlikely to be any guild MT!
---
This comment hurts
---
And what stops them from gating the 5 mans? Releasing the raid earlier would make it less faceroll if people had no access to the items. (not that it won't be faceroll anyway, dem 1.12 talents pack a punch)
---
Yeah, lots of high end pvp guys will record all their fights so they can go back and review what happened too. 
---
Did you mum really play a warlock? Top lady XD. 
---
That's only a thing if they implement dynamic respawns incorrectly. 
---
It should only be a thing in starter zones or &gt; 20 zones at most. 
---
It should only increase the respawn rate if a certain number of people are in the surrounding area. 
---
nice! you should do a Loka' :))
---
How far are you trying to get? If you're just looking for MC/ony/AQ20 you could probably just pug whenever you have the time and see one open.
---
If it wasn't a mace then sure but warriors miss out on 5% crit or 5% chance of an extra attack which is far preferable imo. 
---
&gt; high level in shooter games?
---
I don't mean pro or anything, but take a game like Destiny and they're end game PvP. You would have to win 7 games in a row to "win" the mode and this would be a regular occurrence between me and my teammates. In Fortnite on PS4 I was rocking a weekly average of 33% win rate in Solos. On PC that's dipped down though, about 10% now. 
---
It's subjective, and I wouldn't want to step on any toes with that comment so I tried keeping it vague.
---
I thought critters wouldn't trigger the Curse proc, maybe it's different for this one since it drops loot, I'll remember that since it will also be a good way to get a Doomguard in raid if noone is willing to die or you don't want to spend a gold on the ritual reagent.
---
I think it will be a really hard to convince your raid group to let you tank as warlock (besides Twin Emps) unless they were a really laid back group. It would be an interesting thing to try but I don't think I'd be up for it even though it is more viable than what most people give it credit; it would probably be harder for the healers too since I believe they need to pay some attention to your voidwalker. If anything I would try it in end-game dungeons if I couldn't find a tank.
---
Yes, they will be ready for launch this time around. They should have learned their lesson by now regarding that. I am more talking about after the dust settles after the first few weeks or month.
---
We shall see. Can't come soon enough!
---
Why would it be useless? I mean, I have a job, I'll probably only have 1-2 hours to play a day which means I am going to be lvling for a LONG time and that means being out in the world on a PvP server constantly. Being ganked in my limited free time is something I should definitely try to avoid in order to make progress.
---
But I like the Dwarf model too nonetheless. I won't min-max because I don't care about that to be honest and it's not a requirement in casual and semi-causal guilds either.
---
As a tank I'd be happy with that progression!
---
I  enjoyed vanilla tanking on my Druid, but dungeons were as far as that went. Druids couldn't be Uncrushable which meant it was impossible to raid-tank with them.
---
Loka'? Link or image pls, I'm lost
---
Yeah there are people doing that exact same thing all the time. It's way easier with friends if you have any that will play in classic though
---
cock amir
---
The part where he says "buttons like t f g z c v b 1-5" remember to not use his exact ones he mention. Example i took strafe away from Q/E and added strafe to A/D instead. This is way better for every non casting class because your normal A/D just makes u move slower (it's fine for casters that wanna change his direction when mobs/players move)
---
But just find your own keybindings. Some playing can use 1-5 + keys some use 1-7 +keys some use swift and alt some only use swift etc.  Just figure out what keys works the best in your hand, some people even use mouses with 12 side button etc, which isn't needed but can help too
---
I'm not talking about min maxing. Useless gimmick means that you might get something out of it once or twice during your entire leveling, and get bored of it quickly. I might be wrong, I'm not in your head. 
---
Also if you want to avoid getting ganked and have limited time to play, PvE servers are also available.
---
&gt; and to keep up with the joneses
---
This is an unhealthy and unsustainable mentality to have in wow, and in life in general.
---
Yeah I've reviewed my own gameplay in games more often than I can count. Should probably stream my gameplay to save it and review later on.
---
just rank on the weekends for the bonus
---
Yea, it's just on my vaca though :) I don't like to travel, I'd just be playing some other game or watching tv/movies anyway.
---
Coming over from console in the last year, keybinds have been the best part of my transition. I do put a lot of thought into it and I appreciate your input greatly.
---
Looks better than the actual thing

&gt;(it's fine for casters that wanna change his direction when mobs/players move)
---
It's really not. Use your mouse for that. Keyboard turning in pvp no matter your class is a big waste of efficiency. Even in pve, imo. 
---
Yes, but unlike warriors, they lack %hit for their Taunts, which can occur often in a long fight like 4HM.
---
But, isn't that the new art? Not the school 90* curved banana sword thing?
---
Asking the real questions here
---
No dungeons in the game because they cba giving items the right stats for their respective patches????
---
Don't you see how backwards that is?
---
just dont go night elf bro
---
Thank you for the tl;dr!
---
Agreed, regardless of what happens I'm counting the days until classic :)
---
Have you tried listening to podcasts at double or triple speed? It really helps with speed of consumption and minimizing backlog.
---
It's probably not happening anymore, no need to worry about that.
---
Should do Dark Edge of Insanity also
---
Legion was the smoothest launch 
---
I'll admit, i never played caster before i'm a rogue/warrior type of guy, so i believe you are right about this :D My bad

I'm really sorry, but how the fuck should anyone know?

FLOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
And this is why it is a complete joke that people think Classic will stay locked without future expansions.
---
If anything they might reserve some servers to stay Classic but you can bet we're going to get BC, WoTLK, etc. re-released. Now they might very well redesign them by removing flying, arenas, etc. all to "keep it classic" so that they can have 2 different products, classic and retail; but they are crazy if they think ActiBlizz won't monetize this to high hell. What does that mean? It means after 2 years when subs start to drop they will be ready with the next expac, which will then see a huge explosion of subs once again.
---
Ok, but they aren’t exactly in a professional environment. They’re not talking to their boss. I don’t think a video games podcast for a retro MMO is one of those situations where they’re inappropriate. 
---
If someone wrote in to them complaining about the use of “cunt”, and was offended or shocked by it, I certainly wouldn’t consider that even-tempered or reasonable.
---
Nowadays I use a second account, but previously I went weeks relying on the kindness of strangers and never failed to find someone to take a few seconds to group/lead/kick so I could reset. If you're in an active guild it should be even less of an issue.
---
I want to roll on pvp because getting away is a thrill in itself :P.
---
Nobody knows because there were no instances available in the demo but at this point anything is possible. 
---
If the camp + reset macro doesn't work then it might still be possible to just invite someone to party, convert to raid and then /camp to get back to entrance. Then you just reset the instance when you login again. 
---
I found this forum post from 2005 which is interesting as well. They talk about a bug where you can invite someone and camp at the same time and it will port you back to the entrance. But they also talk about how if someone invites you, and they kick you to prompt the "you must leave the instance or you'll be hearthed' timer message then you can logout during that time and you will be at the entrance as well.  
---
http://thedruidsgrove.org/archive/wow/t-9064.html
---
1) What is camp
---
2) Why wouldn't reset instance work? It's a pretty important part of the game, you were always able to reset instances, and you can still reset on the retail client.
---
YoU Only ChOSE a CoOkiE CuTTer BuILd ThO.

I got this itch as well after Classic was announced.  What I did was go to their support site and I think there's an option to live chat with a GM.  I told them I hadn't played since 2009 and was thinking about resubbing and asked if they had a promotion for returning players.  He just added 7 days playtime to my account on the spot.  I got online and looked through all my stuff and messed around, and didn't end up resubbing (because retail WoW).  Maybe try that out if you just want to nostalgia trip over your characters.
---
Druid tanking is ridiculous in wotlk, had the pleasure of healing a BiS with almost 90k HP.
---
I feel sorry that you missed the golden era of gaming and have twisted ideas (thanks to shitty publishers like EA and Activision) of what a good game is. 
---
if your just a pve guy then playing with high ping is fine 
---
I fucking love shit like this. Great work man
---
&gt;The more chars the quicker ill get back my 200g investment 
---
Well, no. You need the investment in every char. It's not like you can put 200g into getting the transmute on one alt and suddenly have it on every other alt. You'll also need to put 200g on them too. 
---
Also, you're not considering how much gold you could have made with your main in 2d played. At a reasonable 30g per hour, that's 1440 gold. So, you didn't just put in 200g per character, you put over 1600. 
---
Which, at 10g/transmute, you'd need 160 days to break even. Half a year. 
---
We also didn't consider the time spent buying mats, transmuting and selling. Let's be generous and say you can streamline the process into 2 minutes per day. By day 160, you spent 320 minutes, or just over 5 hours, which comes down to another 150g loss. 
---
So basically, either do it for half a year straight to start making a profit, or don't do it at all. 
---
Also, you're much more likely to need a ton of gold at the beginning (bis and prebis crafts+mount cost), which will most likely be multiple thousands of gold. Spending those two days farming 1400g seem more interesting at the beginning when you need it the most, rather than having infinite gold when you only need it for consumables down the line. You would also have a ton of time to prepare for incoming gold sink in future patches. In my opinion, gold is at its most valuable at the very launch, and there's not much point in setting yourself back 1400 when you need it to most for 70g/week profit when you barely need it. 
---
Yes, this is a discussion about progressive itemization. And I've clearly stated why it makes no sense given that we're having 1.12 talents anyway.
---
I am not asking for "the game to be changed" anymore than you are. The difference is that I'm willing to admit what I want isn't a 100% faithful representation of vanilla (because I know that's possible), whereas you pretend what you want is so you can spout "NO CHANGES!" to simply shut down discussion on anything you don't agree with.
---
That makes you the snowflake here, kid.
---
If you disagree, feel free to show me a time in vanilla when all items were both in their release variants and players had access to 1.12 talents. Because you can't. Because this didn't happen in vanilla.
---
Doesn't matter if it's backwards when it solves the problem does it? We know that they just won't touch item stats but are willing to gate content. It's our best bet at any kind of "progression" with the information we have.
---
Besides, what if there are no dungeons at the start? Time to research new pre bis and stuff....many previusly outright ignored (or never used) items would become relevant for some time. That's a good thing because it would be something new (while being old really) and the community would have stuff to theorycraft about. Throwing everything out the window that was already researched for a period.
---
It'll come in some imperceptible, inoffensive way. An easy pill to swallow, at first. 
---
*Heh, a tabard for $5? I mean that's not too bad, and I like how it looks!*

Oh man I played on Black Dragonflight too! Nice!

There are lots and lots of circumstances in which tank gear helps like offtanking corehounds, one of the plethora of Majordomo adds etc.
---
Just by grinding out fury DPS gear as tank you will find enough tank gear from dungeons.
---
weird weapon
---
Please do, is it your Twitter where you upload all your stuff?
---
I used this as reference. But I did some freestlye in some areas. It's more like a rework [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cw7QqqXzqPk/T\_uHZyzkiTI/AAAAAAAAAC8/c9ArTxokapM/s320/OEB.jpg](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cw7QqqXzqPk/T_uHZyzkiTI/AAAAAAAAAC8/c9ArTxokapM/s320/OEB.jpg)
---
Will definitely try that out.. just want to peep my banks and gear.
---
Thats exactly what I'm doing. Just dont buy prot items like Morris neck, Stockade etc. 
---
There are items that are close to it, just not quite as good. But when offtanking trash as fury warrior, you wont need the best of the best tanking gear. You can work on dungeon drops from time to time, but my way of gearing has always been.
---
\&gt; get 60 and spec prot
---
\&gt; tank the dungeons I need for DPS gear 
---
\&gt; roll on all tank gear that drops along the way
---
\&gt; get into raids asap
---
\&gt; farm the rest of tank gear on your offdays when you arent doing raids
---
The more tank gear you get, the less you need to respec to farm dungeons. Also getting good DPS 1hander from raids will make it more appealing to just stay fury for dungeons, because your 1h + shield damage will start to be decent and you will contribute to the groups DPS.
---
[This is where it's at](http://wow.allakhazam.com/images/fashion/obsidian_edged_blade.jpg)
---
Yep, mainly in my twitter. Maybe I'll come back here with a new weapon someday :&gt;
---
I read that if I managed to get into raids I could get items that human warriors otherwise wouldn't take XD.
---
it's pretty unlikely that they add those back in. You can still reset but you will probably be ported to the nearest graveyard instead of the entrance.
---
Repentence is a big time move for PvP, theres very few ways to get out of Incapacitate effects and is really the crux of the hybrid nature of the Melee/Healing Ret Paladin. You need it both to pause your opponent so you can heal and also as an interrupt against casters and other healers.
---
Divine Favor, while its a decent ability, is OK in raids, its usually just for extra mana, since it most often just overheals. Sometimes it can be clutch, but its a crapshoot. Meanwhile, in PvP without Holy Shock, it really is just saving mana, since a max rank Holy Light will usually heal over 50% of your health anyways. Though the extra healing is handy it really doesnt compare to Repentence's ability to halt someones attack to heal, nor its versatility. Its still your pick, its slightly better healing vs. a stronger PvP game.
---
As for the spec, there are  a lot of flex spots, but you absolutely need Spiritual Focus for... everything. For certain raid fights, youre heals would be severely gimped without it. You wont be able to DME farm or do much AoE solo farming at all without it and its another crucial talent for PvP.
---
This is my hybrid build: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxuzxZZVbxxrcqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxuzxZZVbxxrcqo)
---
Theres a lot going on here depending on how far you want to go PvP meleeing, soloing and raiding.
---
Improved Int vs Str; Depends how much meleeing you want to do in PvP, if its a lot, then Str, if you want to heal more, Int.
---
Imp LoH; This depends what your guild demands of you. They either require you to get it and you sacrifice Unyielding Will and a point in Healing Light, or you dont get it. The point in Healing Light lost hurts but its not insurmountable. The point of Imp LoH in raids is the armor bonus, so the only point in going 1/2 LoH if you want to pretend that you have both talents and hope that no one looks and sees that you only went 1/2 (kind of scummy)
---
Imp BoM; Again, depends if the guild demands this of you. Youd basically dump Parry for this.
---
Benedicion, Parry and Vindication; These are flex points. Benediction is just for PvP mana and Parry is for mitigation, you can dump these for other talents if you want. You can get Vindication instead to try and mitigate melee damage instead.
---
Sanctity Aura; This is also kind of a flex spot. I never used it in combination with SoC, because it doesnt work with SoC. With this spec it only effects; Judgement of Command and Consecration. 10% stronger Judgement is... OK, but in PvP, people will run out of Consecration and that 10% is barely noticeable. In PvE, youll never use Sanctity Aura with Consecration because youll either be using Concentration to heal or Retribution Aura which is going to be doing a boatload more damage in an AoE group.
---
hah na i dont think so. just go human they look sick as fuck in armor and they also out damage night elf. win win 
---
I'd run some duels with you on retro. You'd be up to speed with some help pretty quickly. 
---
Show us the rest of your 60's!
---
Long term investment with very, very little return, a huge cost of entry and profits starting to roll in half a year later at best. I did some quick maths using generous numbers to check the viability of that strategy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ajb8ae/multiple_transmute_character_question/eevh4ro/). 
---
Turns out it's real bad. That's not even accounting for the lower demand over time for transmutes which I can't really put a number on without data. Also I think I did the maths with 70g a week when it should be half, the CD being 48h not 24. So a year to see a return on investment, then. Most likely more as the price of transmutes will plummet because of lack of demand - you only need to get your gear crafted once. 
---
Awesome thanks for the reply, sounds like a great plan!!
---
Vanilla wow has a history of poor itemization, and random blues being better than some raid gear at all points throughout it's history.
---
This is no more true of the "catchup gear" than it is of other blues at earlier itemization.
---
Quite a few people would argue that 1.12 talents are a greater imbalance than 1.12 dungeon itemization as well.
---
If it's not a problem for 1.1 itemization to have some blue gear better than mc gear, why is it a problem for 1.12 itemization to have the same?
---
If it's a problem for 1.12 items to make things easier, why isn't it a problem for 1.12 talents to make you not need those items to accomplish the same feats?
---
Re-tuning endgame content for the existence of 1.12 talents and itemization does not require any of the mental gymnastics to justify that accepting 1.12 talents and progressive itemization would.
---
Also, 1.12 talents and 1.1 itemization never existed at the same point in vanilla history. Allowing this to happen is just as much of a change to the game as re-balancing the endgame would be.
---
There was nothing on launch. Phasing, sharding, etc makes a launch "smooth" but the game was shit for the first few months just like BfA... except BfA is staying shit.
---
Or you keep everything in the game and upgrade the items at the time they were upgraded in vanilla. Solving the problem.
---
if you dont know theres a difference between fuck and cunt i feel sorry for you

Coincidentally UPS paid for 50% of my education.

Please please please just don't level them up. True relics like this are pretty rare; usually people have played a little of some xpac and abandoned them, but it's so easy to re-level to 60 that if you ever want to play retail again (for some reason...) just make a new too, then you can parade around on your vintage dude and be the sexiest guy in town.

Podcasts are great for combining tasks. Maybe try use headphones while cleaning the house. or just chuck it on while driving or when youre taking a walk or working out. You can find the time :)

They can't do that when they literally lost the data for those for real lol but I guess they could still recreate it from old patch notes if they really wanted to (probably wouldn't be 100% accurate but close enough I guess).

Sorry, getting TLDR and transcription mixed up, looks like someone has done a great TLDR about certain portions of the call above :)

100%  agree and we can all look back at this post and the posts on this subreddit and know that we called it.

And that's what I'll play again &lt;3 
---
Thanks very much for doing this :)
---
Aw :/.
---
 OP means a specific trick used when solo-farming an instance.
---
Depended on the servers and the people/guild you met. In my server and my guild for example I never heard about any hate on either prot or ret paladin. People actually liked me a lot, and were enthusiast to run ZG with me as a tank.
---
I swear I accidentally lvled my mage to 61 but was surprised he was still sitting at 60.  When I came back to play WotLK on a separate server I went back on my Paly and was wrecking all the fresh deathnights in AV.
---
there's no option because of the amount of tourists the game will have  
---
dividing servers by sharded or not is just a very messy thing  
---
Maybe you have to get used to it? 4-5 hours is not something I notice, as long as you get to take breaks for drinks or toilet. When I feel that I need a break it is not due to some kind of pain or unpleasantry. Usually it is the sound that gets to me. Listeninh to vonstant music or ingame sounds for 6h+ gets tiring. Take of your headset for an hour to clear your head.
---
Make sure you have good ergonomics, chair/desk etc. Also check that you have good lighting both in the room and the settings on your screen.
---
Paladins were great for strat/scholo with the undead theme. Ass for raids, though.
---
I've read this text so many times without realising it.

Physical immune bubble, hunter's mark and wing clip then. This team has a TON of utility, honestly.
---
Depends what people are doing and at what stage the world is. Like before MC opening elemental fire price will rise, but it will be in general available as everyone will want to farm it from wherever it can be farmed. Then with time the price will go down. On one pserver it started at 3-4g then even 1-2g for some time. Right now before AQ opening there is little to none on the AH as people don't need those fire protection pots that much and the price rose again due to low quantity and increase in players wealth. As for arcanite transmute 15g was the price pre-MC when pre-raid farming was at full swing since then it dropped a lot and \~5g on average if you find someone that needs it.
---
With alchemy I got some gold from frost oil, especially early on as it a quest turn-in item. Aside of that a lot of free action potions will sell, especially when tanks are getting weapons pre-raid, plus PvP usage (more on PvP servers). Other end game pots like mongose will also be in demand, few gold a pot. Flasks were 110-130g each and black lotus 75-90g here. Early one if you got the recipe crafting fees could be quite absurd ;) Also some crafts and rare/raid enchants early one have high crafting fees. And when you farm EPL/WPL undead and other humanoids then cloth that will sell or be a rep turn in. Also wool cloth and felcloth is a good farm item ;) People getting their first aid to max, tailors using lots of cloth too. Fishing works too, later one farming bloodvine from ZG or farm-making large brilliant shards, nature protection potions, shadow and frost protection potions depending on raid tier and so on.
---
subtly showing that you've unsubbed in this subreddit? now that's an upvotin'
---
I had a night elf rogue back in the day that I played a lot of PVP on. I bound /sorry to a button and would use it right before jumping someone, or right after killing them.
---
i think it will need to be sneakier. nothing in-game, but some service or out-of-game feature like a paid armory app. some people will call it out, but they will be drowned in the responses saying how harmless it is.
---
if/when the pservers shut down, the monetization will become more aggressive. nobody will have a choice at that point.
---
Can also do 25/26/0 to get Reckoning, Blessing of sanc for the tanks, and divine favor.  You can still wreck in PVP with a decent 1h/shield + reck stacks or if you just use a 2h.  Depends on playstyle, if you're standing in the back healing might as well take out the 2h for the occasional burst damage if a rogue or feral druid comes into the back to try and harass. 
---
Reckoning is an amazing pvp talent

Maybe I just wasn't on the right server, or knew the wrong people. I mean the guilds I ran with weren't even hard core. But in Vanilla, you HAD to be holy or I got nothing but hate. And in TBC, everyone still considered ret a meme spec.

Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]???
---
The way I did it in real vanilla when a friend wasn't on was was do a /who in a new player zone and invite them. It reset the instance, then the new player left the group.
---
If I remember right they had to leave on their own and it wouldn't break. If you kicked them I think it messed up. Something like that. Been way too long. We definitely reset instances though and solo farmed ZG rep etc on mages.
---
On private there is a macro. I expect on Classic it will just be a reset button with a right click as it's the new client and raid bars.

&gt; If you disagree, feel free to show me a time in vanilla when all items were in their release variants and players had access to 1.12 talents. Because you can't. Because this didn't happen in vanilla. And you're asking for it to happen here. Which is a change.
---
At this point... I'm not sure if you're being serious or if you're trolling. Honestly... I won't be surprised if you actually turned out to be demented.  
---
I'm not the one suggesting changes to the game, you are. Maybe go back and read the previous posts if you're having a hard time keeping up.  
---
&gt; And I've clearly stated why it makes no sense given that we're having 1.12 talents anyway.
---
Your "statement" doesn't hold any value. Why, you ask? Because the 1.12 talents aren't up for discussion. We're getting them, no matter how much you whine on reddit. The only thing up for discussion is the proposed patch cycle at blizzcon. No class re balance, no changes to the pvp system, no retuning of the raid encounters.  
---
And now you're going to reply and ask me "Why?" like the muppet you are. And the answer is going to be the same as it was last time. Because that won't be Vanilla.
---
Yea you're a retard. No further reply warranted.
---
Harder change. Fu#@%s with the servers. They could also easily turn off loot sharing just like sharding. It's just a better solution that doesn't hurt the community.
---
Well, they do have that information as do all of us! It's basically all online on old vanilla websites. It's all been documented before.
---
If private servers can do it, you can bet blizzard can.
---
Not only that but redoubt in general should be changed to how it works in TBC, where attack in general proc it.  Make consecration innate spell and help protadins with mana
---
In general they should just add a talent per hybrid DPS tree (near the end) that helps with Mana Regen. Talents in particular:   
---
Shamanistic focus - enh sham.   
---
Unrelenting storm - ele sham.  
---
Dreamstate - moonkin.   
---
Predatory instincts - feral.   
---
Sanctified judgment &amp; sanctified seals - ret.   
---
Careful aim / combat exp - hunter.   
---
Focused mind - spriest.   
---
Surge of light - holy priest.  
---
Overall they way they fixed hybrids in TBC makes a lot more sense, druid trees in particular. I'd hope it they do any changes, it's not anything new to the game in general. These talents were devised by the old crew and make sense to the build especially if added late in the tree.
---
Keep screaming at your monitor about changes to classic buddy. You all end up where you are right now. Glad you finally decided to take the L. Now go back to bfa. You prolly have some lfr to do.
---
Lol k there buddy. Go back to your private server with fudged numbers, broken mechanics and timetables that never existed in vanilla and keep insisting that it's vanilla #nochanges.
---
Unsubbed around patch 1.10 then came back for a little bit in WotLK then left again. 
---
Its a legit question. Unlike the circlejerk of fucking garbage we get here on hourly basis.
---
Cloth is incredibly cheap for the first 3-4 months on the AH. It will sell for vendor price +20-50%. It will be trivial to level first aid or tailoring to max level for anyone that plays enough to get a max level within the first few months if they want it.
---
Thank you, I don't have the time or setting to listen.
---
Nah, I'm fine right here. Making you bfa babies cry. Ty for the suggestion though.
---
The game has evolved a lot since vanilla and nowadays you can see retris and prots in a lot of guild. Retri with the Nightfall axe is very common and prot paladins are the kings of doing super fast orb and rune runs.
---
Once you get geared enough you can actually skip half of the holy tree and spend those points into prot to do excellent healing in raids and be a very good AoE tank when needed or in 5-mans. 
---
3 60's '-"
---
Read a short video guide called retrowow beginners or something.  Covers the basics in like 15 mins. ex: Shaman kit is garbage look up BiS and go to the helmet vendor then the chest vendor etc
---
&gt; Literally like 2% of the population actually enjoys tanking and wants to tank. If warriors could only tank you would see nobody playing them at all.
---
This has to be wrong because tanks existed in retail vanilla, when nobody thought they were anything like top DPS.
---
&gt; game isn't balanced around raiding people need to be able to do stuff on their own.
---
That's a half-truth. The game isn't *solely* balanced around PvP, but PvP has to be balanced. The game isn't *solely* balanced around endgame PvE either, but if the only meaningful PvE endgame content (which is also required for competitive PvP) is not balanced that is a problem.
---
There'll 100% be an addon that does it if Blizz doesn't put it in (which they most likely won't and shouldn't).
---
Oh yeah, usually I just go to those vendors and build out my gear. Thanks I'll Google that
---
&gt; I really wish people would add "when babysat by a dispell healer
---
The thing with balance is this: You have to balance around a minimally intelligent use of the class/spec/spell whatever.
---
If warriors are off the chain the second there is someone around to heal and dispel them, you have to balance around that because people will figure this out and arrange to have someone do that.
---
That's not the classic classic.
---
I’ll always have fond memories of that sword
---
Thanks for the summary.
---
As expected, having economists talk about games is soulless and makes you worry for the future of our favorite hobby.
---
1.11 was when warrior tanks got enough threat to keep aggro against a DPS warrior going nuts, as I understand it. Before then they could have all the target dummy DPS they liked, they would still do less real DPS than a class with a threat dump.
---
DPS warriors in MC is a product of the pirate server eternal 1.12. Which we will probably have in Classic since they said they were starting with 1.12.
---
If you're not an absolute bot and you do dungeons instead of grinding, then yes, it can work. Still curious about how you get cheetah on a warrior though.
---
Yeah chickens are actually quite interesting. They're not particularly smart, enjoy company, and hunt rodents. This makes the very prone to trying to enter your house.
---
Many people excited to come back, like myself, are going to have to come to terms with being a "casual".
---
Functioning adults, like most of us should be by now, dont have the free time of a teenager. Dont convince yourself to play 5 hours a day man lol.
---
No, you definitely can not. Even more so on a warrior and even more so at launch. Maybe level a char or 2 to 40.

In terms of headaches, make sure your screen is elevated to your height and you're sitting upright. Slouching or hunching over can cause neck/head pain when sitting in that position for too long.

Swarming with Warriors”

I hear ya buddy, I'm just speaking from experience. Most of us were holding regular events, doing story-tellings, RPvP events, creating storylines. Then we'd find some guys saying weird stuff in the middle of the Deeprun Tram. 
---
I miss spending ALL DAY in the same AV.  So much fun, so many big battles
---
They should remake WoW with this style and make it like a top down RPG or something. I’d cry. 
---
Pretty sure I've answered these already, but here goes again.
---
1.12 talents do make a difference, but they're not the only factor - it's also the most enjoyable and most balanced point between all the classes in vanilla. That's #1
---
#2 It's not a problem for some initial items to outscale some initial raid items, what is a problem is dungeon blues outscaling multiple tiers of content - which the catch up blues do. 
---
#3 Re-tuning endgame content, change vanilla - or remake it how it was and progress items accordingly? I know which one I'd pick.
---
#4 1.12 talents weren't an overnight change. Every class wasn't just made OP overnight like the uneducated and ill informed think. It was a progressive series of changes and rebalances over the space of a year or more between patch 1.6 and patch 1.12. 
---
This completely counters your assertion that 1.12 talents and 1.1 talents never existed at the same point. This is horseshit - warriors and warlocks were in thier endgame state as early as patch 1.6 (go and look it up - these are more facts) so if you did progressive talents you'd end up with 1.12 warriors and warlocks running around in BWL patch while other classes are patiently waiting their buffs/nerfs to particular specs. Skipping all of this and going with the completed version of vanilla is a better idea.
---
Honestly, the suggestion to ignore progressive itemisation is moronic, and here's an example that will hopefully put it into context.
---
Imagine playing WOTLK from a fresh launch, and having the ICC 5man heroics in there that give better loot than Ulduar/Naxx25. It doesn't make sense to do ulduar/naxx because you get better gear from 5mans. Like it or not, human beings will take the path of least resistance. The same can be applied to vanilla, if you get better gear in dungeons, why bother raiding?
---
good man
---
I don't think that world first guild are the guys who play wow for fun.
---
Don’t you get kicked if you afk?
---
I still have my 60, I quit right before TBC. I put so much work into my character I don't have the heart or time to do it again...
---
If you don’t like the aesthetic of the Night Elf, there’s no reason to play it. The bonuses aren’t great for warriors and you can make up for shadowmeld with invisibility potions.
---
I say this as a player who makes mostly Night Elves. Cool flips &gt; 4% melee damage.
---
As an Oceanic player it was impossible to raid.
---
Telegraphs were hard in dungeons.
---
Doing a dungeon with no deaths was hard.
---
Doing a speedrun of a dungeon was hard.
---
Doing it all with 300ms was impossible.
---
Such a shame it was a great game.
---
You can also form a smaller zg/aq20 guild for people with less time. That's what I ended up doing towards the end of vanilla when I got a new job and couldn't raid as hardcore as I had been doing. The content is still very fun, the gear is solid if not quite as epic, and running with a tight-knit crew of 20 is a nice change of pace from the massive 40man raids. Then you can just organize pug MC runs on weekends that aren't part of the guilds regular schedule.
---
Wait that's really cool actually.
---
Literally says " You could iterate over all players and calculate active subs. "
---
" which also means that over 50% of the [~~#~~**Warcraft**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warcraft?src=hash) player base is using [~~@~~**WeakAuras**](https://twitter.com/WeakAuras) which is pretty amazing ".  
---
So how are they implying they know what 50% of the player base is exactly?  Ok so the total is 3.2 million then, point still stands
---
East coast/west coast?
---
You can join the BG after you exit it
---
I raided on a Paladin for nearly 2 years. 50 days played time on a pserv blizzlike. Cleared Abom wing and everything before it.
---
Ret is viable. However it is viable under *EXTREME* circumstances.
---
- They need good gear. At least AQ40 ish gear in order to do well. A decked out Pally in T2 can do alright as well. If your damage is declining, try slapping on a [Nightfall](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall). Your raid leader will be less reluctant to let you come.
---
- They will never beat a rogue, mage, or warlock with similar gear and skill. You *can* top the charts on specific fights, especially in Naxx, but those fights are extremely rare and you will be min maxing your rotation like a mad man. It is a very difficult climb up the meters.
---
- It takes a lot of skill and practice to do well on a ret pally. Not everybody can do it. You can't just smoke a fat J and relax for raid, which a lot of classes (like mage, warlock, and some healers) can do quite easily.
---
- They can offer a lot of utility, like BoW on the boss. However.. a skilled holy paladin can do that too, so you really need to emphasis your importance to the RL by having it up constantly and being an asset to the raid. 
---
- Because of their extreme niche, and because their utility is very one-tracked (one paladin can do it all) you will almost never see more than one (if any) in any progression raid. If you're the second ret pally in any guild worth its salt, expect to get sat. A lot. Unless they're struggling to get people, but even then you might get sat in the middle of the raid if it's a progression kill.
---
/rant
---
Yeah 
---
most new guilds full of new members usually go over a fight anyways. also its not really a true vanilla experience when everyone knows the fight but you dont. its not like your all figuring out as a team together to defeat the boss
---
If you fight people as you see them (green to red enemy players, or even skulls when partied up) you should be at or above rank 3 by the time you’re finished with STV.
---
If you're open to criticism, 3 hours is a lot for people to commit to and digest. Shorter episodes under an hour are more accessible to most people I think.
---
That’s not the point. All I’m saying is if you have 100 servers, 33 for each. After a month, they’re all the same after the initial launch experience changes have been reverted.
---
Yeah, but that mog is dog. 
---
I’m a big fan of bows but the gun sound in vanilla is definitely better than retail. I don’t want some engineer’s first pellet gun, give me a Dwarven hand cannon.
---
that's the only difference? boy was I wrong. I thought outlands was gone from this version to, cant wait to go through hellfire without seeing those stupid flying mounts
---
&gt;1) 1.12 talents do make a difference,
---
Which is why you'd need progressive talents for the same reason you need progressive itemization.
---
&gt;2) It's not a problem for some initial items to outscale some initial raid items, what is a problem is dungeon blues outscaling multiple tiers of content
---
But some blues have always done that.
---
&gt;) Re-tuning endgame content, change vanilla - or remake it how it was and progress items accordingly? I know which one I'd pick.
---
Having 1.12 talents and 1.1 itemization is a change. So...???
---
&gt;4) 1.12 talents weren't an overnight change. Every class wasn't just made OP overnight like the uneducated and ill informed think. It was a progressive series of changes and rebalances over the space of a year or more between patch 1.6 and patch 1.12.
---
And again, the same is true for items.
---
&gt;This completely counters your assertion that 1.12 talents and 1.1 talents never existed at the same point. This is horseshit - warriors and warlocks were in thier endgame state as early as patch 1.6 (go and look it up - these are more facts)
---
In patch 1.11: The warlock talent soul link was changed. The warrior talents of Improved Bloodrage and Shield Slam were both changed. Odd considering you claim them unchanged since 1.6.
---
Go look it up. These are more facts. Please try and actually learn a bit about the game before you start spewing your opinions on people.
---
My all time fav weapon, thanks 
---
If you’re just keeping the character for the alchemy transmute, the passive gold is not worth it. 35 levels is a lot of hours to dedicate to a small handful of gold every 2 days. Actively farming with your main or farming alt will prove much more lucrative.
---
You can try to be self sufficient and save costs via making level 35 crafting alts, but getting a good guild is usually a better option.
---
That's badass. Thanks!
---
Why would you grind grey mobs stupid? You can grind mobs up to two levels above you with virtually no down time. You can also easily cleave two while kiting with piercing / hamstring if needed.
---
Yeah, my problem was Raid Leaders would just flat out say no. I didn't raid as ret until TBC. It was when the troll raid in ghostlands launched. (Forget what it was called) 
---
But a friend of mines guild was headed in, when some people were a no show. I had okayish ret gear as I was MT for my guild. And I ran with them a lot after that. Plus I proved rets weren't so bad anymore. I was consistently in the top 3 for dps. The top in some fights. 
---
I LOVE paladin. The class lore, and identity really speaks to me, and (in TBC) the play style was a lot of fun! But in vanilla, they are just outright shunned unless you're holy, and I'll probably roll something else because of that.
---
Sounds fine. Getting both dps and tank sets makes you valuable among a guild. They will use you as they need for a tank and should let you DPS the rest of the time. 
---
I sure hope it wont work. Instance farming isn’t good for the game.
---
&gt; Just because someone plays on a pserver does not mean they know how to play optimally. 
---
Couldnt agree more. The worst players I have ever ran into were female players in prestigious guilds that had cleared full content in any given xpac. SO I agree. Not a slight against female players either, just from my experience the ones who make it in guilds get carried pretty hard.
---
When I mention that private server players are "better" I should clarify... Ability-wise, many retail players are far more competent with mechanics and binds etc etc etc, but the private server players in general will have more knowledge and be more familiar with vanilla which will give them a massive edge in the beginning.
---
You don't need to go prot just to spam 5mans bro. its not bfa. game is much more freeflowing and less strict and railed. though its abit more convinient to do it as prot, but while prot you cant go back and dps or pvp, when as dps spec you can do both tank and dps and pvp (apart from the raid content).
---
Depends on what role is needed, you can organize runs and reserve shit without taking on a tank role either, its not like tanks got a divine right to reserve stuff, anyone who organizes a group can do it. obviously if you cant find a tank go tank it yourself, but its not nessasary if there is a tank around and its more natural and give less talks and questions and better rep and respect, like "wtf you take dps gear for being tank", some ppl dont really respect it. ubrs in particular. and you'd take that mdps spot for yourself.
---
also care with reserving shit, long term its better to make a friend and have better rep, than get a gear piece. So in many cases sharing roll for some item with one person is a nice middle ground (so its 50% to get an item if it drops). instead of hard reserves (depends on the item and situation ofc).
---
Yup. I won't be playing Paladin again. Probably Warlock :)
---
I remember playing private server that was just a hub with vendors and Alterac Valley (or maybe there were other battlegrounds too but I remember only Alterac Valley).
---
Saying it won’t appeal to newcomers is false. That’s way too broad of a generalization to be made.
---
Its not my video and i just copied the title. Just wanted to show a cool fight in BRM :)
---
&gt; Some people can. My gm on my pserver has never played vanilla or wow for  that matter before. Her husband is new to vanilla but not wow. 
---
He wont have an authentic experience. He will be surrounded by players who know almost everything. Those players will help with his spec, give him tips on leveling or what pets to use... Insignificant pieces of advice that would have been MASSIVE during fresh retail launch. He will never go through a dungeon without EVERYONE telling him where to go and what mechanics to expect. He will have his own fresh experience but its entirely incomparable to retail vanilla.
---
&gt; some people can have a first time experience because they will only  associate with people that have no idea. I think pserver players will be  in the minority on their servers and mostly all in the same guilds. 
---
Pserver players will be a VERY small minority and will likely not be in the same guilds. You will find small pockets of them and will certainly find some prevalent guilds that will stick together, but overall they will be spread throughout all the servers in various guilds. Were talking close to a cumulative million unique players approximately ever since Nostalrius. ALL of those players will be interested in Classic. I still think that less than 1/10th of the players who try Classic will have played private though.
---
&gt; I think the try hards will have fun and so will the super casuals. People are over thinking it. 
---
Yes. Until its not fun. Until you cant have fun in a BG without engineering and until you dont get invited to a raid with a meme spec. The top 1% of players push the meta... That meta affects everyone and becomes the baseline requirement over time which raises the level of competence of all players so that everyone can stay competitive. AM I SAYING that you need engi for random Q bgs or a specific spec to get into a raid as soon as Classic launches? Hell no. But the bar of expectation will constantly rise with no end in sight... More and more will be expected of players and depending on how long Classic stays stagnant, the meta will slowly become the expectation.
---
Most of my guild FML....
---
I envy you. You might drop out of life for a while without major consequences. 
---
This is kickass. This is from the statues in the Burning Steppes, right?
---
Luckily the one or two mechanics wont be too hard to remember lol 
---
I don't think it's burning steppes but I know it's from the dark portal so yeah :)
---
I'm a glutton for punishment, so it's a toss up between druid and warrior for me.
---
By “fun” you mean sub 80 iq casual “fun?” Believe it or not, some people actually enjoy being good and knowledgeable about the game. 😱😱😱
---
The exact release date hasn't been announced yet, they've only said 'Summer 2019'
---
Not true at all. The vast majority of guilds want to see that youre putting effort in to getting the best gear, but they dont require it to come to raid. 
---
Getting really sick of the people in this subreddit talking shit about private servers they have never played on.  We get it, you want to believe that private servers are shit and Classic will be some sort of utopia. In reality, the private servers are very similar to what Classic will be.
---
Might be August when you go back to school

I found it helped me a lot (when bgs gave xp) to level a toon just by pvping. That forced me to learn, but also introduced new game elements one at a time so I had some time to master, say, switching between Aspects as a hunter before I had to incorporate Scatter Shot into my game.

RemindMe! 16 July 2019 "Check in on WoW Release date loser"
---
I'm not going to bother, you seem to love ignoring facts. Braindead. Go play retail, classic is not for you.
---
Oh you’re right! Didn’t even think of the obvious answer haha
---
There is indeed an [altar](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/wowpedia/thumb/5/5c/Altar_of_Storms_%28Burning_Steppes%29.jpg/1200px-Altar_of_Storms_%28Burning_Steppes%29.jpg) in the Burning Steppes with the same statues.
---
Look up the weapons from Blackwing Lair, they are prime for this awesome treatment.  Especially Ashkandi!  
---
Great work!
---
I disagree, I have played a NE since original launch and shadowmeld has come in super handy. Granted, it works best when it drops you out of combat and saves a full wipe and GY run. 
---
&gt; But it does grind my gears when people who should know better (since they're on this niche subreddit lol) praise the old talent trees without really mentioning the caveats and design flaws inherent in them.
---
Speaking as something of a Timmy myself, I suppose, I'm on "this niche subreddit," because I greatly enjoyed my time playing vanilla WoW and want to recapture some of that joy in conversation with others who feel similarly while waiting for Classic to go live this summer.
---
I literally couldn't care less about bad talents or "meme specs" or whatever else the CharOp crowd for WoW entertains themselves with. I don't see the appeal and doubt I ever will, but hey, you do you. Just don't go assuming my (or others') being here is in any way indicative of a shared interest in the mechanics of the game. It's not.
---
&gt;I've played on private servers.  I vowed never to raid or pvp again, but I did MC for kicks.  I did not do MC, BWL, AQ40 as of 1.12 because it was Naxx and only Naxx.
---
Not really sure what youre saying here... You didnt do MC, BWL or AQ40 pre BC?... "because it was Naxx". Blizzard said that midway through vanilla over 70% of players had experienced MC. Tons of players cleared MC, BWL and AQ40. Naxx did come out close to BC and not many people had the opportunity to do it, but im not sure why that prevented you from raiding throughout vanilla...
---
&gt; Naxx is the kicker.  That is one raid that pservers could have gotten right. 
---
You realize that they source their info from multiple sources right? You realize that guilds had FULL combat logs saved during retail vanilla and for many of the encounters they have a copious amount of data. When I say that pservers are within 1-5% of accuracy im being very conservative... They are INCREDIBLY close. There are certain spell effects and abilities that may be slightly off. Certain item procs may be off... But these are nuances that a player like you, would never even notice if you werent told it was a private server.
---
&gt; Now, no one has any proof that private servers have 1.12 all wrong. 
---
Right. Quite the opposite in fact. Theres a wide body of available information about the cores that shows where they sourced their info and A lot of details can be found on the nostalrius forums. Most of the details were confirmed by video and video WAS used to get certain pieces of information that could not be sourced. There were also some pieces of data that were extrapolated based on other values (ex. level 42 wolf does X dmg, level 43 wolf does Y dmg, we dont have the values for wolf at 44 but based on the previous power curve increases we can safely estimate Z...)
---
&gt; Every private server has gone from iteration to iteration each claiming it was 90% Blizz like. 
---
I dont think they give exact percentiles, but with the cumulative amount of data that makes WoW, its likely closer to 95-99%. If the server was 5% off it would be fucking INSANELY noticeable. Like, flying mounts and crossrealm noticeable.
---
&gt; warrior rage is still being talked about to this very day 
---
...as are various paladin affects. These have MASSIVE implications for the VERY top level players who are min/maxing. I also want them right... But for someone like you, or anyone else in the pack, you wouldnt even notice the difference if you werent told it was there. Which is why the thousands and thousands of players scowering old posts and logs struggled to produce a perfect replication, because what they are currently using is almost indistinguishable from the actual values. Again, its sexy to highlight flaws and then pretend that they completely rewrite the experience, or devalue the product, but it is simply not true.
---
&gt; Private server devs got laughed at by Blizzard when discussing raid accuracy. 
---
They did have a laugh... But it wasnt negative at all... This was in regards to Onyxias flight path. Blizz was actually surprised that a group of pserver guys were able to do such a great job on the pathing (which works exactly like the original in practice but is coded entirely different) so Blizz wanted to see what their solution to the coding was. The Nost guys told them and then they asked if they had gotten it right, the guy from Blizz just chuckled and didnt correct them, because he wasnt going to reveal how Blizz had fixed it. Blizz invited the guys from Nost and asked them questions like this DUE TO THE ACCURACY that they were able to reproduce with such LIMITED resources.... yikes, you seem dense...
---
You seem like a guy who is really passionate about Vanilla. I am too. You also seem like a guy who has a really limited experience within Vanilla retail and are basing your opinion on some romanticized memories from over a decade ago... Whats more likely? The private servers with TONS of evidence to support them are more inaccurate or do you think your memories are likely inaccurate? How about private servers... You seem to have a chip on your shoulder but answer this; Do you believe that the average private server players will rise to the top of the playerbase during Classic and outperform the average retail player during the initial launch and for a short time afterwards? If your answer is yes, doesnt this validate their experience and thus the accuracy of the servers if their knowledge of the game can be directly applied to the final product of Classic?
---
My biggest annoyance with the spec is losing to other hunters. A 0/24/27 hunter will pop deterrence to cancel out a big chunk of your pet damage and beat you at range. I also felt so stuck on melee at times without survival talents and scatter to escape (intimidation is good, but doesn't fill the gap)
---
But man is it fun to watch your zg serpent just rip someone to shreds
---
camp means logout
---
OP is asking if they will be able to log out and in to teleport to the front of the instance they are in.  this saves significant time resetting instances where you don't have to run back to the entrance or die + run back, e.g.. the difference between 20 minute clear and 12 minute clear is +2 instances per hour, or ~60-70% more clears/gold per hour, which is obviously very significant, both for the economy and for early gearing curves.  these times are just for illustrative purposes, but would not be far off the truth in a lot of cases.
---
case in point, the 1.12 behavior differs from the 7.3+ behavior so it will be interesting to see if it is considered a 'feature' worthy of recreating or a 'bug' worthy of fixing.
---
Imagine full classic wow in pixelart
---
Holy shit 3 minutes is too long.
---
The bottom line here is that you are a retard. You told me to “go look up” how warrior/warlocks talents didn’t change after 1.6, and I gave you 3 examples from a single patch of their talents changing after that time.
---
Your response, rather than admitting you were mistaken, was to double down on your assertion of talents not changing for either class past 1.6
---
It’s not me “ignoring facts” here. It’s not me being brain dead.
---
This is a legendary video from vanilla mate
---
Lawlbringer heyoooo
---
Zul'Aman. Also ret got a lot stronger in TBC compared to vanilla.
---
Now imagine if it's on the 28th of August. 
---
I found that I couldn't any more last time I played, particularly just doing one thing. I joined the premade bg group on p servers a few times. It was fucking torture. I can't just sit there and hardcore grind for hours on end, it just isn't in me anymore.
---
Dont wanna be the bubble burster here but what is the difference? I mean honestly... What is the difference if you watch a video prefight or listen to your raid leader (who watched the video and has done the fights dozens of times on private) coach you through the entire fight via voice command?
---
&gt; aiding without learning the fights way in advance in order to have a true vanilla experience? 
---
You cant have a "true vanilla experience" when the puzzle has been solved for over a decade. You would need to find a full guild of players who had NO vanilla experience and then silo yourselves on your own server without any outside influence while you stumbled through content. And at that point... is that a real experience? You cant have an authentic vanilla experience when you arent playing during its initial launch.
---
You are raiding with 39 other players. You are bound to have some players who desire to be competent and will look up fights. When your guild struggles they will explain what to do or offer various different strategies that they have seen... Those players will know their positioning and MOST players in your raids WILL be using addons, ALL of these things inevitably impact YOUR experience as well.
---
&gt;NO need. Your raid leader or some member of the 40 man team will download and addon and call out phases of the boss. Whether you use an addon yourself, watch the video of the fight or listen to the voice commands, you will have a full on guide to take you through.
---
Deus Vult!
---
&gt;dividing servers by sharded or not is just a very messy thing
---
If my estimates are correct, you're actually fucked because its gonna start around the time most of students go to school  
---
(late aug or early sep)  
---
if only i could be so grossly incandescent.
---
Reminds me of MegaMan X-Series
---
Exxxxactly. Their response? "Only the top 1-2% of guilds figured out strategies and then the rest copied in vanilla anywaaaays". My response and the difference? 
---
TONS of guilds werent using addons, didnt have threat meters for the first quarter of vanilla, were using TEXT based boss strategy guides... It was actually INSANE to see how many DIFFERENT ways guilds completed bosses as they often didnt have a visual to go off of. To this day on private, there are dozens of different ways to do each and every encounter which is ENTIRELY different than current retail. In current retail, the encounter is solved by the top 1-2% and videos are put out and then those  are the only 2 strategies that the playerbase learns. After that its just copy cat time. Which is EXACTLY how vanilla will be. Your guild will watch a video and then its copy cat time.
---
That just isn't accurate. Like I posted in another reply to this thread, the only change made that had any effect on warrior threat in 1.11 was a REDESIGN of Shield Slam, making it cost slightly less rage (30-&gt;20) while REDUCING its base dmg (base threat) and giving it a MINOR scaling component (since it scales with Shield Block Value, which is not a readily available stat until full Dreadnaught basically, and even then it's miniscule) - making it a slightly better threat per rage ability. ALSO, some threat reducing effects for DPS classes stacked in an additive manner in 1.11- meaning you could be reaching close to 0% threat with items like Fetish pre-1.12, which became not possible in 1.12 (after 1.12 you DPS classes did more threat per damage when considering threat reducing effects).  
---
Your post is just factually wrong. I don't know why you would post misinformation without researching it. But to be fair, I feel like I see you posting stupid shit elsewhere on this forum since you seem to have some misguided agenda against private servers.
---
You just opened up a can of pixels my friend.  
---
So many weapons that need the pixelart treatment.  
---
What about when you factor in using Seal of Wisdom as holy when you're low on mana?
---
When I hear companies(not just blizzard) say things like summer 2019. All I hear is September 23rd 12:49am (1 minute before it's offical Fall, and no longer Summer 2016)
---
They hated Azzmo because he speaks the truth
---
Those estimates suck, that is not summer! Be more poestive
---
&gt; but if u are tanking dungeons 
---
You wont be. It slows you down. If you do decide to go, ferals and hunters make WAY better tanks until sunken temple. Also, you can tank dungeons as fury with a 2hander which is preferred for better threat per second so that your team can unload on NPCs, killing them faster and actually REDUCING the overall damage you take. Your slow threat, slows damage, slows kill speed, prolongs fights. Chain CC and SMASH NPC's quickly to tear through dungeons.
---
You are correct. We always gave non-humans priority on 1h axes in raids. That means Deathbringer, Doom's Edge, and Crul'Shorukh.
---
However if you're going to roll a non-human I strongly recommend Gnome, as Escape Artist counters one of Warrior's biggest weaknesses in PvP, being kited. Plus they are obnoxiously difficult to click on :)
---
\*Cough\* July 16 \*Cough\*
---
So your damage goes from "shit" to "mega shit" ?
---
Consecration is incredibly mana inefficient. What good is having mana if you're using it on terrible damage? Good / Fair damage comes from seals and judgment - but if you replace that with seal of wisdom... it's just white damage and shit consecration.
---
Ughhhh... Ofcourse he does dummy.  "rank 14 warrior" ...
---
Leveling speed is not as important as being bracket one for the first few weeks of ranking IF a server launches with the honor system activated. The quickest ranking in vanilla is during the first few weeks when you can secure the top bracket so most players who are going for rank are less concerned with leveling and MORE concerned with honor per hour. Most of these players take an optimal PVP guild and are even known to spend time collecting valuable items early like rare pets, tidal charm or taking engineering and leveling it to increase their potency in PVP.
---
So yea. Obviously he would take a subpar leveling spec because his primary focus for the first few weeks is PVP. He likely focuses EVERY enemy he is capable of during his leveling. This would be the only reason to go arms pre 40.
---
First aid in world Pvp is a huge deal. Being able to have the option to bandage when your opponent is sitting in a nova is a huge help.
---
The only change I'm ok with is hunters being able to wield maces
---
Pls take my internet karma and good irl karma, bless you 
---
Hmm...I read "30 yard range, 20 second cooldown."  Guess my quick glance was a hopeful one.  I remember it being 12 or 15 in TBC, is probably what I was thinking.
---
I think the big issue with SotC is you can't have other seals active.  If it could proc something else, that would be quite good.  In TBC, JoTC was quite useful for me and my friend who were duo leveling, with him on a priest.  He liked Sanctity Aura as well.
---
If you moo as a Tauren he makes a loud moo noise. If you do it on anyone else, it doesn’t make a sound.
---
How useful do you find repentance?  It's absolutely terrible pre-WotLK, IMO.
---
YESSS!  I know a lot of people would love both Arcanite Reaper AND Whirlwind Axe.  If I could posit a measly request though... Warden staff maybe? &lt;3
---
I don't care what original vanilla was like, doubling the pop cap to 5000 would make the game world feel infinitely more alive and reduce groupfind / pvp queue times (thereby delaying server population death due to boredom) WITHOUT negatively affecting the gameplay experience due to excessive lag/resource contention. In my opinion this would be the sweet spot where the game would feel really "massively multiplayer" and fun. The original cap of 2500 is too low and the world would feel dead to me (yes I'm spoiled by playing on private servers)
---
Increasing the pop to 7000+ is where things start to go too far in the other direction. Wait in line for quest mob respawns, every resource node is picked clean, prices are sky high, chat is spammy, and maybe the server lags too.
---
The talents don't change, they don't do an overhaul of the talents in any of those examples. They just change the way some of the abilities work. A completely different thing again.
---
You're literally walking around calling an apple an orange and expecting me to agree.
---
You're so stupid that it defies logic.
---
It is, and honestly I’m respecing full Holy at 60 anyway so I might not even get it. 
---
The only reason it would be useful is as another sheep in dungeons and as a DPS boost because JoC does extra damage on CC’d mobs. 
---
My internship is from mid May to early August, back to university in mid-late August. I’m praying for the earliest release so I can maximize my summer play
---
Nope. But it's awesome anyway, and it makes those weekends you respec into dps feel oh so good.
---
**Overpopulation: Fun at 60. Terrible at 1. End of argument.**
---
Someone has to hook me up with som of that kung pao chicken 🐔🤤  
---
Yeah, and that's not even taking into account that the dungeons were hard as all fuck in general compared to your average MMO dungeon.
---
It was a great game.  I had a blast playing it and leveling up.  I know people have their own opinions, but I absolutely *loved* the story and world building.   Housing was phenomenal.  There was just so much good about that game.  However, PVP was utterly fucked from the start.....and then came the raid shit and that was game over.
---
Yeah they're not able to do just a small tuning.
---
 it's either they do nothing or they go in a balancing crusade and end up fucking everything up instead of very small number tweak that would make it still bad but viable.
---
