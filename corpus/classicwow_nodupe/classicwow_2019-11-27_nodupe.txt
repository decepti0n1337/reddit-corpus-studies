REEEEE STOP HAVING FUN REEEEEE
---
---
---
Orc is objectively the best dps warrior. Troll is objectively the best tank warrior. (On horde)
---
I have a HOTW spec (0/30/21) and I get most of my gold by stealth-farming the elite bug caves in Silithus. I do it early in the morning when nobody else is around.
---

---
It's kinda RNG'ish due to the nature of Arcane Crystals, but on average, I get 1 arcane crystal from doing a circuit around the whole zone, which takes me about 40 minutes, so that's, on average, 75g/hr.
---
I'm Whitemane Alliance too and just logged on for the first time in a week. Trying to get to Azshara I got camped in Menethil by the same fucking loser SMorc and John Deere players as last week. 20 minutes later I finally get to Theremore and there is another group just sitting in there killing everyone. Imagine spending all day every day sitting in one spot with 14 other people so you can gank.
---
You had me sold with the first part... then you listed your changes. 
---
I kinda agree but once bgs come out most of that wont matter as much anymore. Although i do think there needs to be more and stronger guards in neutral towns. Pretty lame how easy it is to get attacked with zero consequence from guards.
---
Ok but considering it was bam worthy back in Vanilla, your point is moot lmao
---
My point is that there's really nothing to worry about at this point.
---
Not underpopulated on heartstriker. It's about 65:35 (alliance:horde) right now. 
---
We used to have almost perfect 50:50. That was fun. 
---
Nowadays there are death squadrons roaming through any 50+ zone, steamrolling you once you're in sight.
---
That's when I hearth to town
---
go to retail
---
Lmfao are you out of your mind?
---
I took me an hour to get from TP to BRD last night, and I'm Alliance.
---
Alliance is definitely not winning the world pvp battle on that server. The only place we seem to consistently dominate is Dire Maul.
---
Seriously, PVP is a sandbox that allows people to be arse holes if they want. Unless you're new to the internet i cant really see how you're surprised that people on the internet can be dickheads. Especially if you incentivize them to be dickheads 
---
Complaining about it is all well and good, but other than offering you the ability to move off the server whats the solution?
---
Should have rolled on a PVE server moron
---
Sexymap
---
Search “guzu farming gold” on youtube and be happy!
---
too bad it wont be pre bis until bwl
---
But it's not tho.
---
If u want to be a tank, do that. Warriors got it rough but its that or druid
---
"retail is better than this trash"  
---
bye
---
Dkp blind bid doesn't have this shortcoming in any of the guilds I've seen that used it.   If it's known an item is not needed by anyone or would be de'd you can just min bid it which is usually a tiny amount of dkp, like one boss worth.  But highly sought after items like talisman or BRE are going to have lots of bidders so you can try and be conservative and make a guess at others bids or you can just bid 1 higher than your highest competition in which case you are spending an amount more proportional to the desirability of the item when compared to a fixed cost system.
---
All the ep/gp. Fixed cost with LC or whatever systems I've seen lend themselves to gaming the system   and ultimately problems like this where loot could benefit the guild as a whole one day if given to a player for offspec but they won't take it because it damages their ability to try for items they want in a disproportional way.  In a bid system I've seen people spend a month or more of point earnings on a single item because they wanted it that badly and also seen really good items go cheap rather than be disenchanted because either everyone else had it or didn't want it for their spec.
---
Since you mentioned the scans - will scanning the AH on one toon update the data for all of my alts on that server?
---
Cool story bro!
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
It's depressing being unable to kill players 10 levels lower than me. Warriors just suck in 1v1
---
I so happen to be a Tauren and indeed I embrace their kindness.
---
You sound sad.
---
I cannot give exact numbers, but to my recollection there wasn't really any *huge* inflation until TBC hit. Until then I am sure there was a slow gradual inflation, but I don't remember noticing it at the time.
---
On my server prices of a lot of things that were intially in super high demand actually seem to be slowly falling. Mostly pre-raid BiS items or things like Righteous Orbs where everyone needed them at first but now demand seems to be tapering off.
---
[removed]
---
Alliance
---
Same, but I'm not interested in dumping another 250-300 hours to just get back to this point. If I could transfer I would.
---
From my pserver experience I'd say it's more like 20-25% inflation rate per year which really isn't that bad.
---
But yes I would advice to invest with it. Plenty of items are bound to inflate quite massively in price.
---
Because I wasn’t even trying to make gold.
---
I seriously doubt there's a good solution at this point, so I doubt Blizzard is going to do anything. Faction queues and server xfers can't really address the inherent imbalance between Horde &amp; Alliance on pvp servers without essentially forcing Horde players to re-roll Alliance to avoid queue times. At most, I expect they'll offer transfers to PvE servers and hope that the problem is going to mostly solve itself in time when BGs release.
---
it honestly blows my mind that people complain about it.
---
I managed to farm 650g one night and 250g the next morning on my rogue to get my mount. By soloing an instance with a certain path. Hit me up with a dm if you want the route.
---
I think just frostbite, frost nova, and entangling roots are the only roots in the game if I'm not mistaken?  Imp hamstring and imp wingclip aren't technically roots
---
Yea definitely unfortunate. Hope y’all continue to prosper
---
Troll is clearly the worst race for Horde priest.
---
I'm a girl hihi &lt;3
---
Blizz needs to fix their shit. Tuesdays and thursdays are unplayable in org.
---
Pick pocket SM/BRD runs?
---
I used to pick pocket and grind the silithus twilight dudes too, had a high raw silver drop and often dropped high levels greens (chances at blues) as well.
---
Been watching Barny64 and Uberdanger's YouTube series on WoW classic, are there any other similiar ongoing series like these two?
---
My point is not in Classic being a different game. My point is that Classic doesnt have a single thing that would make you want to play it. After you try it out for lets say an hour, you expect there is something coming up at hour 2,3,4,5. There is nothing. Just the same kill 10 of this and that all over again.
---
Classic is literally a Zombie day care center.
---
Lol, too bad there aren't servers without PvP..... oh wait. Problem #solved.
---
SW on Incendius never looks this packed. No wonder we never take Searing Gorge from you guys
---
I got like 30 firewater for 1g each the other day so yeah I guess it depends on server but do juju make you THICC!?
---
That music is awful
---
10/10
---
Mining. 
---
Max it to 300. 
---
Silithus Stealth Hive runs for Ooze Covered Thorium .
---
Arcane Crystals Drop at 6%ish rate. Sell for 40-65g per dependent on server economy. Boom.
---
All things like this should have realm specifications on it cause some people are acting like every realm is horde dominant or the other way around.
---
&gt; 5 dungeons, 4 resets in 1 hour. 
---
This is not true because it only applies to the very first hour. E.g. you cannot do 10 dungeons in 2 hours (just 9) or 15 in 3 and so on.
---
When it was Vanilla, and I was an insecure 10-year-old, I would *never* play a female character.  
---
Now, I’m playing a female NE Druid and Hunter because the male NE animations are ridiculously dumb looking.
---
Would kind of ruin the whole point of classic. Having a horde of players attacking goldshire by walking from Burning Steps is part of the fun. That being said I don't play classic but I get the appeal.
---
The more I interact with the community the more I feel silly for not anticipating this.  Players aren't the same as they used to be.  Makes me feel old to say but kids these days are soft.
---
Late to the thread, but would using this when you’re not actually stuck flag something?
---
Can't you make like 30g/hr just fishing in Ashzara semi-afk?
---
The only correct answer is "On a PvE server".
---
I was basically trying to go against every popular tactic to surprise people and to troll.
---
Grats.
---
Did you edit in that light shaft thing over top of him at the end? If not, where is it from?
---
&gt;Anyone playing a warrior as something like 31/5/15?
---
That's what I was shooting for but I like shield spec, toughness and defiance. At 54 now, prot were the last  points allocated.
---
The solution for me is to roll on a PvE server.
---
DM wasnt released in a different order.
---
And there’s many more on the other side.
---
Retail hand holds you through every step of the way. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed the questing in Classic. Having a 100% drop rate on virtually all quest items is stupid. Part of Classic is the grind to 60.
---
Questing isn’t the only and shouldn’t be the only way you level. You should be grinding mobs to round out levels and farm gold. The way quests are set up basically make this necessary.
---
I can’t tell you how frustrating, yet how rewarding it is to get a character to 60, and then realise how much work it required to get into raiding. 
---
The Onyxia attunement quest chain (for Alli at least) is frustrating but extremely rewarding at the end. The level of coordination and group involvement required is a fair bit. The community in general feels much better in Classic, with many more willing to help each other.
---
Only the other night, I needed the key to DM North to get my Mage water quest done. We formed a group, got the key from the imp. The group was happy for me to duck out, get to DM North and get my quest, while waiting for me before they took down Hydrospawn. I got back in, jumped down and we downed Hydrospawn straight away. How did I repay the favour? I stayed on to help 2 of them down 2 more bosses as they were hoping for some loot drops.
---
You don’t see that sort of stuff in Retail.
---
It's pretty hard to expect DPS to wait for you to build threat, especially in PUGs. I main tank too, and have to deal with the same stuff as you. I've found the best way to deal with it is to try and work around your DPS. If you can mark targets and get everybody to attack the same target, then you're at least focusing your taunts and bashes and whatever other tools you have at a single mob. I play a feral druid so I forget what tools you have, but my taunt has a 10 second cooldown, my combat charge has a ~15? second cooldown, and I have a bash with a 30 second cooldown. Even if DPS are being a pain in the ass and constantly ripping agro, I can swipe enough to distribute enough threat to hold most of the pack, and then I can bounce my taunts, bashes, and charges around enough to keep the situation under control.
---
Good DPS won't make you do this, but you don't always get good DPS in your group. I don't mean big damage DPS, but good DPS who understand threat, understand their class, etc. You could just leave groups, but there's a lot of bad DPS out there. Part of being a good tank is knowing how to work around the mistakes of bad DPS, lol.
---
was it tho? can you provide a source stating this? same faction griefing could be if it was extreme this wouldnt even qualify as greifing if you ask me let alone extreme griefing
---
&gt; Or you allow the people who dont like the situation to transfer off?
---
That's what the rest of my sentence said, yes..
---
Who is you
---
I think maybe your experience is the exception. Literally being camped at LH right now.   
---
Last night I was killed in Kargath by a group of ally camping the town.
---
And as you said, DM is always alliance. I would say BRD is Alliance controlled 90% of the time too. 
---
The server is 60A/40H.
---
Is there a pve server where horde outnumber ally?
---
It's pretty obvious what OP does to that hunter on meta-level is basically the same what that troll did to him (or may be even worse).
---
You’re the Make Love, Not Warcraft guy?
---
"my friend"
---
I think it would definitely help and I'm personally fine with it, the only thing that sucks is for people whose servers had mass exoduses of the opposite faction and through no doing of their own are on the dominant side.  Now they have to move against their will.
---
But I think it would be a step in the right direction and a lot better than the current 'uhh you can transfer here if you want, alright go straighten out our mistakes amongst yourselves plebs.  You have x amount of time to make your choice, where x is any fucking amount I want for any reason so GL. Also no we won't publish any kind of census data so GL lol'
---
I don't have any issue, but I'm also mostly threat geared.
---
Open with Whirlwind for snap aggro, throw a SS on skull and then a couple of sunders on X and Y. If you're a good tank, you can hold aggro on 3 mobs quite easily.
---
I've seen **very** few good tanks in Classic.
---
Meanwhile in the news: "World of Warcraft Classic drove record quarterly increase in subscriptions".
---
Sounds like you want to join the horde 😘
---
He killed a tiger. Shame on him. What a terrible human bean 
---
Upvote please
---
When does the head drop?
---
Likely because he knew it was gonna happen and vanished
---
As a mage, you literally cannot kill druids. Their HOTS cannot be stopped, they have an instant burst heal, have a shit load of HP in bear form. Most importantly, you cannot control them. They are immune to polymorph and all slows/roots. 
---
They can just moonfire you to death.
---
Matchup gets better for mages I'm later phases when spellpower gear gets good, but still druid flavoured
---
Wut?
---
While obviously not every man who plays female characters in games secretly wants to be a woman, this is a rather common thing for trans people to do before they’re out, or even realize they’re trans. You see it come up pretty often in places like r/egg_irl and r/AskTransgender
---
That said, you’re also leaving out other possibilities, such as just liking the female character models more than the male ones
---
Most servers are already at or near capacity, so the same number of people will be playing just more of the minority faction
---
Its too late for that now though, you have to convince your whole guild to xfer over. Thats minimum of 39 people or you need to find a new guild. Not to mention there are other relationships which have now been formed.   
---
  
---
Its not like Blizzard couldnt have nipped it in the bud, they just chose not to and also chose to make megaservers. Faction queues will just make people quit.
---
Ok.
---
&gt; my creative freedom on a fury warrior is whether i take piercing howl or not
---
And fury warrior is perfectly fine to tank dungeons, run dungeons as DD or run raids as DD. And you should be fine doing world stuff.
---
Now if you want to tank raids you can probably use fury prot. And you will still do more than enough damage in dungeons and do world content just fine.
---
You don't have to be in raid tank spec to tank a 5 man dungeon, nor do you have to be in raid dd spec to do damage in a 5 man dungeon.
---
So quality for you is completely dependent on having trash world mobs having 20% higher stats? 
---
I find that very strange. 
---
You guys hyped it up and it literally blew my mind how bad it was. It was as if classic was the second coming, a game to end all games. My dissapointment was seeing that there was literally nothing there.   
---
Classic isnt even an alpha version of what WOW is today.
---
Aren't there way better tanking weapons?  Like the bear paw that drops off Magmadar.
---
Bet we wish we had something like sharding right about now, huh?
---
Not going to say that it’s going to be exactly like vanilla, however on Eredar US at least, the world pvp took a nose dive when BGs were launched. There was still wPVP in some capacity but it was mostly around the world bosses. Everyone was trying to get exalted to get items from AV. It got a bit hairy during the AQ wall grind but it wasn’t terrible.
---
theres a 20% decay on your RP that you will have on the reset.
---
For example if you have 4k right now and accumulated 6k ranking points, you will have 8k tomorrow.
---
Yes its definitely possible to decay with your little honor.
---
Haha yeah like I said it would need to be tweaked, maybe to include healing done per death or damage done to calculate some kind of “combat effectiveness” stat.  I’m a warrior so until BGs I’m sure my KDA is pretty fucking bad too.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Yeah you will be banned and you will deserve it. Don't support the scummy gold buying industry.
---
I think you should ignore the ppl who:
---
1) don’t know what game they are playing
---
2) don’t know what game they would like to be playing
---
3) all have different ideas on how to “improve” the game
---
Instead of ignoring the people who have been successfully playing this version of the game for a decade
---
But to each their own
---
hahah reading the incantations = extra procs I love it
---
You spelled opinion wrong.
---
they're still pretty damn good. Alot more palatable for some people than forking over 600g for the Flurry / Deepwoods axe combo
---
&gt; I get what your saying but it's no where near as bad as you or everyone else is making it 
---
[Go ahead and watch this and tell me this again with a straight face.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctn-tKXx4Sw)
---
Haven't had any issues at all with chat. /shrug
---
Timing shields never seems like a good plan for me as a rogue. 
---
Shields all have shorter cd than duration, so assuming the shield ran out, they can cast it as soon as they get uptime. You can stunlock to prevent a shield recast, but they can always trinket and shield.
---
That's what I tried but it still isn't showing up. Is there something in the indicator "bar" that I need to tweak like in the layout section? I tried playing with frame level, location, orientation, width, height, etc. but can't see anything.
---
How often are these posts the same person multiboxing 5 accounts?
---
No serious player is raid logging right now lol
---
Well the longer it takes for a solution the worse the situation gets. People in the minority faction are going to start quitting. Which means the population imbalance gets worse...
---
&gt; By Wrath we were at 71 talent points.
---
They should have stayed at level 60.
---
Terrible? Nah, i wouldnt say that. Its simply a dissapointment in a time waste. Just like you might share your disdain with retail im doing here for classic.
---
Ask his dad.
---
FAP and the helmet from Ulda. Stay sharp, and always charge them first. No mercy.
---
You got that backwards, on Stallag 6 is the usual for a stealth class.
---
its actually pretty much the same on fairbanks. 
---
Edgemasters are 5-600g 
---
Flurry axe is 300+
---
Deepwoods is 250+
---
First let's see if 10k players even exist at that time.
---
That is your opinion. My opinion is right and your opinion about my opinion being wrong is wrong. ;)
---
this plays exactly how Kevin Jordan said survival spec was designed to do.  Use range when possible, but run in like a ranger and mess things up before running back out to reset your range ability use.
---
Think Aragorn/legolas.
---
sit critting doesn't proc anything
---
It would result in a huge amount of these posts, each of which only relevant to a small portion of the community. A screenshot can also be doctored or hide nuance and context.
---
I agree partially. The strikers Mark is likely an exception. I currently use the carapace spine cross bow and out dps hunters using the gunfire MC and strikers mark due to the importance speed plays. The hunter who got the strikers mark had a faster speed bow than that at the time so strikers Mark was a huge improvement for the person. So his damage output went up around 10% versus giving it to a rouge or warrior for a 1% damage increase. The fact that we hadn’t downed rag at that point was also import as the guild wanted the biggest gains for each piece of gear. Min/maxing is lame in classic and doesn’t matter. We let people run any spec they want, we have boom kin, shadow priest, survival hunters, and all types of shamans raid with us, and are now downing rag. Progression was probably a little slower but who cares cause we have a ball when we raid and give each other a ton of shit.
---
So in conclusion, you can, as you so convincingly put it, suck dick for not knowing how to support an argument, all other melee people are cool with me.
---
"Fact"
---
You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
Nope
---
also firewater lasts 2x as long so it's more cost effective for me but again that can vary on pricing
---
Mankrik, I believe.
---
I've always found the pvp really fun, as have most people I've played with. 
---
Is it perfectly balanced? No, but to me, thats what makes it fun. Finding your own edge in a system that gives everyone a ton of different crazy tools. Its not an esport.
---
a horde whining, lmao
---
maybe blizz will do something now?
---
anyways this is the experience for most alliance players out there
---
almost all the pvp servers are massively horde favored due to their OP racials
---
Real champions just ride the wave of a single sword proc constantly proccin itself (though, admittingly i dont know if this was *fixed* before 1.12).
---
... I kissed a girl today for the first time.
---
I anticipated this to be the case back when they first announced the phases. Honor coming out but no battlegrounds... what do you expect to happen? I tried to tell people maybe consider a PvE server but everyone said PvP is the "real" version of the game whatever that means. Anyways it should get better when battlegrounds are released soon. Faction imbalance is a whole other problem though.
---
&gt; So your solution random people who probably arent the problem should be inconvenienced because you are?
---
...Yes?
---
Other games do this exact thing. When one side is over inflated, people who are underinflated get priority to balance it. That is precisely what just about every single open world pvp game does and has done.
---
I know it ruffles the jimmies of some people who enjoy their 10:1 stompfests, but the rest of us want to actually enjoy the game.
---
this. if you release WSG and AV simultaneous you're killing WSG anyway cause AV has more honor.
---
blizzard should act but these are devs decisions and they dont want to spend money on devs, so yeah, pay 15$ to not play and suck dick
---
I'll jump in this because I'm in this guild and witnessed all of this go down. First, a couple of key points for clarification to the crowd reading this: The GM deleted the public group because you were continuously spamming the discord channel after being asked to move it to another channel so everyone wasn't getting notified. Please stop playing victim and acting like it was intentionally deleted to cover our ass. Second, your BiS sheet you showed us all had items that will literally take years to gear. Sorry, you will be waiting in line to get two rings of spell power. Unfortunately, you are not the only caster in any guild, let alone this one. There will always be competition for gear. As I'm sure you can understand, part of the game isn't just about getting gear; it's about helping guild members out, professions, and other various tasks. Third, unfortunately, most loot systems run this way. Why make special treatment for you, when other people need OS gear as well? Say it was a shadow piece that dropped, and a holy priest wanted it for shadow spec? Should he get it for free? What if they were rolling against 4 other people that wanted it for OS? At the end of the day, YOU decided to roll on an OS piece, you used your points, and now you're regretting it because it lessens your chances for MS gear that you'll be rolling against people for. Lastly, although I believe you had other people agreeing with you, you were blasted in Kromkrush discord and on general chat when you tried to defame the guild name due to you being upset. A correct way would have been to be respectful of the situation rather than try and make the situation worse by posting in WoW channels, discords, and now Reddit. Put on those big boy pants, if you're new to WoW, you're in for a hell of a ride.
---
Like most people are saying it's quite bad on paper. But as an ele shaman, roaming pvp with another enhance shammy is so much fun. 2 Grounding totems and 2 earth shocks and most importantly your stormstrike works for my nature spells too.  
---
Yeah, it's very RNG and not the best, but it's fun! Play it if you like it mate.
---
Get started on a gathering profession or two. I recently leveled Herbalism from 1-300 on my Druid and it has made me around 100g in a week or two just picking up whatever I see while leveling. Being a Druid has the added benefit of being able to stealth to dangerously located herbs and instantly quickly run off with travel form. It's very efficient.
---
Mining should be excellent as well.
---
If you really don't want to do professions, you can run Strat Live.
---
And based on your many angles of your rant, you appear to be a millennial who expects instant gratification.
---
Retail would be perfect for you. That’s not a dig, it would be perfect for you. Your rant isn’t fact, it’s an opinion and I’m not saying it’s wrong. You clearly expect things to happen much quicker than classic provides it to you. Classic is clearly not for you.
---
Pickpocket BRD. Is it mindnumbingly boring? Yeah. But it's relatively safe (aside from bad luck with resists, guaranteed gp/h.)
---
My jaw dropped when I ran into Sentinel Amara Nightwalker on her frostsaber outside of Dolanaar for the first time. I think I followed her up and down the road for 15 minutes asking my friends how I could ride one of those cats.
---
 I think you’re taking this thread too seriously
---
Nah, I ljust ike MMOS that dont play like serving a prison sentence where i bash rocks with a rubber mallet.
---
"the gimped faction"
---
Why do people keep spreading this myth that Alliance is somehow significantly worse than Horde?
---
Vanilla PvP is all about your class and your gear, not your faction or race. Racial bonuses are just that: bonuses. They don't make or break your PvP experience.
---
Enjoy playing on a dead server they said.
---
These players have free will. They're choosing to act like this.
---
Pretty sure BGs are gonna be cross-realm...
---
Nost and Northdale didn't have nearly this much WPVP because battlegrounds provided an outlet.  It won't be this bad once BGs drop.  Those servers were just as large as the servers we have now except perhaps Herod/Faerlina/Whitemane etc
---
No mirrors in your house then I take it? Zing..... I'll show myself out
---
Sucks that evil Blizzard made you all play on the same server and never offered transfers off.
---
Yea warden staff is the best Tank staff for best until end of TBC :D
---
Allows the mage to see all the buffs that the target has.
---
MS &gt; OS
---
Rogues generally only pick fights they can win.
---
I've been getting camped by one on my shadow priest. Waits till I have 20%  mana  pops out and has a shadow reflector too. Can not be trying harder.
---
bro, thank you so much for this - managed to get people reset and ran it tonight...although support made every single person contact them individually and some agents refused to do it whilst others agreed... so people were having to requeue to try and get a kind GM
---
But thank you, wouldn't have tried this if not for you
---
, Says the priest
---
You're saying this like the Horde players deserve shorter queues despite being irredeemable assholes.

Got some free AWS credits and just brought things back up.

Warrior is worth it in the long run if it's what you want to play. Leveling really isn't THAT bad.

With dynamic respawns it should be faster right?  If you are in a party can everyone loot the item or just one per kill?
---
You should be able to grab a cheap one off the AH by the time you are ready to start doing instances.

Wow, you've turned embarrassing yourself into an art form.
---
“Classic doesn’t have a single thing that would make you want to play it.”
---
That needs a very important change made.
---
“Classic Downey have a single thing that would make ME want to play it.”
---
Id have to agree. As a warrior your dps isnt fantastic untill you get quite geared out, which has a big price tag attached. But then it becomes really REALLY good. A rogue will be consistently pretty good, and if you are a decent player it will scale well.
---
Yep, you should receive rep, just not XP!
---
To you. It's the same as any other pop culture icon like Star Wars, superheroes, etc.
---
Yeah lets just have 1000 of the same "I rolled on a PvP server and hate it, this is Blizzard's fault" threads, that's way better.
---
That wont do it either.  Mageblade isn't an "OS" kind of weapon.  It's the best option for all mages and warlocks.  Would you prioritize something that drops maybe once a month to a new player over the 8 core players who have been raiding for two months trying to get the very same thing?  
---
I can see how this is understandably frustrating, but there's really no excusing the simple fact that if you join the party two months late you should be at a disadvantage on some things.  If you want that to be the case, join a guild that is newly forming.  That way you wont be at that disadvantage.
---
UPDATE: We all got buff and dc'ed then lost the buff because of the DC #GGBlizz
---
Is that latte or cappuccino?
---
Well they could just merge some of those lopsided servers.
---
I mean it would be amazing to see happening... ofcourse queue times  would be a thing but imagine this scenario:
---
An  alliance server where they are dominating literally everything one day wakes up to face off a horde playerbase of similar strength... the world pvp would be of epic proportions as 2 factions who were used to dominating are now forced to fight against eachothers on equal footing.  
---
Its never gonna happen but this would literally fix the balance issue, queue would be the new issue and people whining they didnt want a merge.
---
I quit because of this.  
---
Level 55 and could never finish a quest without dying.
---
If I could go back in time I would have rolled a PVE server.  Starting over just didn’t seem appealing.  😔
---
Go to BRD and open doors to the gate lock, pick the gate lock then go up to the Ring of Law. Pickpocket the Ring of Law starting the in client stopwatch when you start pickpocketing. After doing the full ring go down to the hallway that leads to Angerforge, before you cross the gate/bridge jump out one of the windows to the left onto the Dark Iron Highway. Pickpocket the highway and double back towards the gate room to arrive back at the Ring of Law. After the timer hits 8minutes you should be able to start over again at the ring of Law. I’m getting about 40g per hour w/ auctions. Vend at the Grim Guzzler, don’t get close to dogs and always wait for vanish to be off CD. (I am pickpocketing w/ a Sub spec so Combat might get less per hr I’m not sure.)
---
They do but Blizzard cs has been pretty shitty towards classic
---
Acting all hands off like no changes applies to customer service
---
The best part about this is that he's writing from the standpoint that the "people who play wow" are some obscure subset of players who happened to have landed on the discord.  Ily Richard,
---
&gt; I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed the questing in Classic.
---
Common man. Common. You enjoyed Classic questing? Common. There is no questing in classic. 
---
Developers placed mobs in areas and added some text to tell you to level up by killing them. Classic has no questing. It has mob kill counters.  
---
You cant have a whole game up to level 60 that takes a dozen of hours be a tedious chore and then claim the game is good. Even raiding is basic in Classic from what ive seen watching others play and you could probably do it with your eyes closed if you played retail last 5 years.   
---
TBC is still a bit barebones but its magnitudes superior.

My issue is that this was hyped beyond belief and seeing how out of touch with reality everyone was lead to serious waking up since i did spend time here and gave it a legit shot. You follow the beat of the community and you end up getting  cold shower.   
---
Just like it got hyped i want to give my input too.
---
I think it takes 3 or 4 full UBRS runs in addition to all the world boss dragons you have to kill.  It was harder in vanilla though.  The last part of the chain is killing Drakkisath and collecting a quest item (same for horde and alliance).  In vanilla he would only drop a few of them and it was white so anyone could just loot it.  Pretty sure UBRS was a 15man back then too, so even more competition and ninja opportunities.  This caused a lot of drama.
---
If their made funny, yeah it is. 
---
Those posts aren’t getting removed now, it’s just memes disappearing every time I browse new.

Core hound tooth is way better since you can get dagger skill on gloves

I'm making a collection :D
---
Very cool trick. I did this a couple of weeks back using both my druid and hunter alt in same party. Basically cleared the ogres with my hunter and killed the boss on druid. I was unable to kill the mystics as druid - but it's probably doable with a little bit of creativity.
---
I got a weakaura that displays how much absorb my barrier has left and it's done wonders for me. Seems like 6ou might just be getting a display bug where you barrier has run out of absorb but the animation doesn't go away. Have a look for a barrier weakaura to see if this is the case
---
Lmao
---
it is not the population
---
it's the balance of that population
---
when horde outnumber alliance 3:1 on almost every pvp server it is a problem
---
People seem to think I'm mad at the state of Blizzard's servers: I'm not, and don't expect them to improve in the near future. Instead, I thought it was cool how many people were online and spamming all at once :P
---
I feel so lucky that I got mines when Pagle was still super layered up.
---
Still took a couple days, but I was alone in that spot on my layer when he spawned. No interference.
---
Meanwhile the total population of ironforge... Jeff, a level 24 retribution paladin and his octogenarian dog Flossy weigh up their options “do I want 1 or 2 stacks of minor mana pots?? Hmm”
---
PvE servers are great. None of these issues. Just saying.
---
You do not need to be prot for any dungeon including full UBRS. If you have 2 tanks or any cc at all the entirety of UBRS is cake no matter your spec
---
Those are the same balance numbers as Grobbulus and we also can end up with 30+ minute runs to get to BRM instances.  I guess the difference is that it happens to both factions rather than one having it controlled all the time.  It's 100% a population problem, though.  The game world was designed for 3.5k players and some of these servers are sitting at 15k+
---
So a pve horde server then.
---
Im a baby boomer looking for a spanking actually.  :)
---
As long as this subreddit is about people giving opinions about classic ill share my opinion. If indeed no one is allowed to say anything negative then a mod will probably kick me. I think thats how it works :)
---
Elemental for pvp is so much better and so much more fun.
---
Lmao oh my lord. The children with their intelligent ideas are out in force. Here's the deal, transfer to a different server (if that's possible) or reroll on a different server. But that's classic. They don't need to make changes
---
Yeah the games pretty bad tbh, it definitely shows its 2004 age. But there's nothing else to play atm and it is mindlessly fun.
---
Ye that's what I meant, bad wording. But they can also blink just before you place it as well...
---
I hate mages.
---
Long cues will make ppl quit the game.....
---
youre missing out on the danger and sometime positive connections you make w/ the opposite faction
---
problem is most servers are so imbalanced (mostly favored horde) that one side get camped 24/7
---
No problem man, glad it helped out some people!
---
High pop realms everywhere with large queues every night to get on. I believe the hype is still strong, months in. I don’t believe Blizzard even believed it was going to be this popular. He’ll, they had to add additional Oceanic realms post launch to cope with the demands.
---
The server I’m on (Arugal) was one of the last realms to have layering turned off due to the amount of players.
---
There’s hype, and it’s still there. The hype isn’t for you.
---
Nah.
---
These are the ones I’m sick of seeing. There is world PvP on PvP servers. It’s not news.
---
&gt;Surely wouldn't the easier solution be allow people who dont want to be on a unbalanced PVP server to migrate to a PVE server where they can control how and when then engage in PVP?
---
Easier yes. But not better as it will only accentuate the existing problem as people on the weaker faction leave the server, further increasing the faction imbalance. We have already seen this happen in the first round of server transfers Blizzard allowed which is why they have started doing faction based server transfers between PVP servers.
---
None of this is necessary. All we need is faction queues so the logged in population is a lot more balanced.
---
You shouldn’t have that much liquid gold cause inflation will cause it to be worth less in time. Inflation isn’t huge in classic but when harder phases hit, flasks will be more prominent and cost more since players will have access to the greater gold in the economy. 80g flasks may be 85g-100g and thus would give you profit long term
---
Things like larval acid and nature resist will rise in price from general inflation and increased demand. I would turn at least 1200 of that gold into investments
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
What a time to be alive. If you look at the activity on the census, its upwards of 7K players, and that's PEAK peak population. Most of the time high pop counts look to be about 5000 (not even twice the Vanilla cap).
---
Does this also means the popular dungeon strat (Heal + HoT -&gt; Drink before combat flags) will trigger threat on mana regen?
---
Fuck that's hilarious
---
what daggers/1h weapons and enchant are those?
---
It can be both gear and the class, but simply ret will just fall behind for quite awhile.  If you push it a ton you might be able to do some ok dps, especially with a nice 2h weapon. But you will always be behind.
---
I apologize. Nostalgia is the one thing. ;)
---
I can’t even find the ilvl 71 Rogue set, all I see is the ilvl 63 set... anyone have a link?
---
Warriors DO ramp up slower than rogues that is true, both will be HEAVILY weapon reliant as all melees are.
---
With that said, the damage ceiling for warriors is massive.
---
Easier time in the early maybe, but it can be worth the grind!
---
Yeah, they can't understand you. It comes across as gibberish.
---
Did you read the part where I said their queues are hopefully no longer than the time it takes to fly to a spot to camp? What's that, 10 minutes tops?
---
I totally agree. Blizzard has a problem on their hands.  If people can't play they Aunt play. 
---
All these new classic PvPers will quickly start to realize the higher up in rank you go the more honor you you must get each week just to hold your current rank and not lose rank to honor decay. Its an ever increasing time commitment to PvP and it can quickly take up all of your playing time
---
Even though you were just being an idiot, it totally reads like a joke though, so don't feel bad\^^ . I'd think it just was someone being funny if some1 said this and left my game.
---
But I like my NE’s *Bounce Bounce Bounce*.    :(

Let me guess, the shaman followed up with a “sorry forgot anhk”
---
Happened to me last night on my 19 twink, full alliance t1 geared raid
---
You rolled on a PvP server and are upset about PvP. Seriously just reroll on a non PvP server then. I’m only level 41 on my first character cuz I’ve been ganked so much while leveling, but I know what i was signing up for when I rolled PvP.
---
Yes, it is about giving opinions.
---
Your post stated it all as fact. You have a warped sense of reality to think that everything you say is right, and is the right answer. If you are in fact a baby boomer, this all makes sense.
---
I haven’t been able to quest in the evening for the last week at all. Every 50+ region is completely camped.
---
Rhodesiajim I think they are complaining about the low server quality.
---
Yeah I understand that. Just wanted to check in. I can't provide a ton of math to help solve your answer but I could suggest you check Warcraft logs and check other people's buffs to see what they stack? Might provide a metric if the top 5 all have same buffs and are all missing other buffs :)
---
I’m a holy pal and right now my devotion aura is around 730 or so. When I’m playing with friends or in dungeons and I use it, everyone else says that they see it as a lower number than what I see it as. 
---
Can someone please explain this to me?
---
Do you really want a tank to be equipping any of those gloves?  Leather or mail with no stam?
---
I make 40 to 50g an hour with pp + coffers
---
I'm sorry for you and am amazed what all these call to transfer trolls reached already.
---
People honestly think faction imbalance is the problem instead of the horrible honor system for world-pvp. They blame it all on faction ratio, and then, to **fix** it, they make faction balance *worse* on the server they are leaving, and also *worse* on the server they are joining.
---
Don't get how people don't realize this. It must be that you secretly admire 10v1 stomp fests and hope that you'll be in the group of 10 on the other server. The reason for world-pvp being exclusively 10v1 fights, by the way, has nothing to do with faction ratio (at all). It's that it doesn't require skill to zerg a single player down, but instead of subtracting honor, it awards solid honor to each of the ten players. These fights happen on both factions, frequently, and on every single server. Stop this delusion.
---
Play on Faerlina PvP then. It’s nothing but a gankfest on that server.
---
You don't really see the big picture. There are ally dominated servers where horde get fucked and horde dominated servers where ally get fucked. 
---
BGs are cross realm. It doesn't matter which faction is dominating because you'll get an even number from the servers who have the dominant faction joining.
---
Yeah it’s ridiculous that meme templates from outside of wow can’t be used. There really is no reason for it
---
I'm saying that comparing ranged weapons vs. melee isn't a good analogy, since hunters get a great ranged weapon by default, that no one else can use, and it's a 50% drop rate every week.
---
In that situation it’s really just preference. Keep the orb though incase you get mageblade from MC
---
I'm gonna be logging on in just over an hour of you wanna meet up.

**NA-Fairbanks|PvP|Horde|PST**
---
**Raid times:**
---
**Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST**
---
Tue will be added as a 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content and will continue through the rest of classic.
---
We are a Late night progression raiding guild that is looking to expand its number and push content. We are an adult based guild. Joking, Swearing, and having a good time is a daily occurence.  
---
With only raiding two nights a week we expect our Raiders to be very efficient and show a high level of commitment. All raiders are required to have an 80%+ attendance record and are expected to come prepared to raids. (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community. 
---
Currently we are 10/10 MC and performing split Onyxia runs. We accomplish both raids in less than an hour and a half. We are currently a top tier guild on fairbanks based on our MC clear times. We have no plans on slowing down as we move forward through the remaining phases of classic. 
---
Outside of our Raider ranks we want to build a community. Our goal is to have an environment where people can play together and enjoy all aspects of the game. This includes PVP and PVE content other than raids. Currently we have many members enjoying PVP. With the release of BG’s in the near future, We want to start having organized PVP. 
---
We are currently Recruiting for a second raid group. This group will have the same days and times as our first raid group. Currently we are open to all classes and would be open to absorbing a smaller guild into our ranks. We are also accepting PVP and casual members to help expand our community.    
---
We also are accepting exceptional members to our primary raid.   
---
If you are interested in joining our community contact Funnyman (Discord: Funnyman#4802) Or, you can head to [ ](https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters)https://forms.gle/TWVTsWhDMFzxQFM87 and  apply!

Spell power, you need tons of spells to make crit better.
---
Oh, dang. I also heard that plus the exp. you get a 110 boosted char.
---
Im a Wow player. If something about wow is hyped its hyped for those that have an interest in the game as well as the outside world. Im interested in the game. Thus i picked up on it. 
---
What my opinion is on the hype i written here.
---
This might be a weird suggestion, and come as a shock. But I'd literally transform every PVP server to a PVE server if there is a heavy imbalance. And bring it back to PVP if it gets more balanced.
---
I know, most people would say no to this...
---
BUT faction queues I think are worse.
---
At the moment alliance (on most servers) isn't allowed to play. If you bring faction queues you are literally saying horde isn't allowed to play. So I come to the conclusion .... PLAYING &gt; NOT PLAYING
---
Check out his POVideos on guild youtube channel, sub for more. BGs soon, enjoy!
---
How great is the buff that it’s worth that wait? How long does it last?
---
Are you hitcapped? (5% in dungeons) If so, wear more threat-oriented gear (crit is big for Deep Prot, Defense is not a good stat) and make sure to mark + Shield Slam ASAP on a pull. Make sure to keep using Revenge, and tab sunder. 
---
If they don't attack your marked targets, then it's on them.
---
AoE Threat is a bitch in Classic; If they think it's fine to split their damage on all targets it's *definetly* on them. If they all attacked the same target, and waited like 1-2 seconds on pull you should've  been fine unless they crit everytime and you got crazy unlucky with Miss/Parry/Dodge.
---
Mindlessly fun. Ill take that.  :D
---
Never played a paladin so I'm just guessing, but do you have a passive talent that would increase its value for the player only?
---
both air totems, would need two shamans
---
No problem with hunters? I'm under the impression a good hunter can't lose to a shaman, unless they get jumped on and one-shot before they can scatter and freezing trap. Very easy class to kite.
---
Glad I don't recognize any guildies names in that vid. That's pathetic for the horde.
---
Classic is my first time ever playing WoW, so I have no nostalgia-fetisch to fulfill, and I enjoy this game extremely much
---
I can't wait for the bloodbath
---
Group up do some dungeons, I love classic but damn I hate questing. But a killing Emp Thaursian after a grueling 3 hour BRD run is just a damn good feeling. Or getting that first epic from MC. Watching Ragnaros rise up from the fire makes me nervous Everytime. Come back for some bgs  try a 2 hour AV if that happens. The game is about one long boring grind that eventually pays off with a purple item. It's not perfect at all that's why a lot of like it. It's designed poorly yes, but we love it for some weird almost sadist reason .
---
You just haven’t caught up yet.
---
What was some of your gear during this video?  I'm currently rocking as many blue damage and healing items as I've found, and my star fires are not nearly as hard hitting.
---
IIRC correctly, the only place that was ever mentioned was on a single rando Facebook post and it somehow spread like wildfire.
---
You can always flag yourself to kill off that hunter sniping burning exiles with multi shot
---
Wow, can’t believe I missed that. Thanks a lot! It was driving me crazy having a single bar for my raid frames haha.
---
Even if you could do this, the split would have to be ~65 35 in favor of the alliance for equal representation in world pvp. 
---
“Good guy” mentality in the alliance is strangely powerful, and a lot won’t pvp unless provoked.
---
You bet
---
Just use Dal'rends set :)
---
They also utilized pulley systems I imagine. Most likely they had people working every level of the well to ensure smooth day-to-day operations..
---
It’ll still be plenty contested because you’ll have shithead solo players that will refuse invites because, despite playing a fucking MMO, can’t accept invites or type a word to another player without having a panic attack due their crippling social anxiety over interacting with another living creature other than some dumb ass cat.
---
Yes and i find that design decision to be something out of 1997 and makes the game not being able to be even comparable in quality to retail wow. The majority of the game, in some cases 50+ hours is mob grinding to max level. 
---
Release a game today in this state and it would be panned beyond belief. The essential point is that Classic doesnt even compare to retail in quality while it has been hyped beyond belief as the second coming. Its an awful game propped up by nostalgia.
---
54/46 is actually a pretty good faction balance.  If people were upset about that, they aren't going to find much better anywhere else.  I play on Grobbulus with a 52/48 balance and we still have 30+ minute runs to get into instances sometimes.  It's a server population problem, not a faction imbalance problem.
---
This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen!
---
1% crit is about 10sp, but if you intend to pvp remember that dots can't crit
---
No they definitely find it fun. They wouldn't be camping a boat for hours on end if it wasn't.
---
Hm, maybe sharding was done soo.. this wouldnt happen? :D
---
Just a thought..
---
Because it came from the official WoW Brazil Blizzard account
---
Yes they can and can do it very well indeed.
---
Before BWL there’s
---
I already decided I'm transferring the second a pvp server can transfer to a pve one. Idgaf if my guilds coming or not. People dont realize that bgs arent going to fix this crap. The people doing this arent doing it for honor. They do it because they like camping people in a fight that's impossible for them to lose. These dickwads arent even good at pvp, which is obvious by how fast they lose control of an area the fucking second the alliance start any kind of resistance (looking at you final boss on grob, yall are trash lol)
---
It really depends on your location and other people around you. 4G can get really congested if you're in an area with volume of users. Ironically you're better off using 4G in the middle of nowhere than downtown.
---
Give them more responsibilities.   
---
Delegate responsibilities to each of the three. They should be your Vice Presidents, and be in charge of specified departments.   
---
Give one of them complete control over loot and gbank. Give one of them complete control over raid rostering and organization. Give one of them complete control over in-raid leadership. (these are just examples. You will need to structure your guild in the best way that suits your guild. If you have a pvper, then make him in charge 100% of the pvp raids and battleground premades. Maybe you want to combine the loot/bank role with the raid leadership role and create another role more suited to your friends personal talents and desires. See what I'm saying?)  
---
This is a win win. You will get to remain President (and rightfully so, given your body paragraph), and they will get the power that they seek.  
---
Better yet, put your ego aside and ask them individually in a personal setting what they feel your shortcomings as a GM are and how they could do better. Maybe they are right. Maybe one of them takes the symbolic role of GM, and it is you that takes a VP role as raid leader, loot distributor, etc.   
---
The most important thing to realize is that you and your officers are a team.
---
Your advantage is you know about it and can act. Not in regards to the officers, they are leaving regardless, but you have an opportunity to reassure your guild that you are the best option because you can bet those officers have contacted every top dps, heals and tank in your guild to garner their support. So it's on you now, through your actions and your words.
---
I've ran UBRS over 30 times, seen MH twice. Nice job.
---
Yes it will.
---
Also. Those 2 are ugly addons in my opinion. If you want a more natural look dow load auctionator
---
I had to BRB today, because my grandpa died. Mum came to my room and broke the news.
---
Why don't they just have separate queues for alliance and horde on each server?
---
AV just around the corner you can get a 33sp off hand
---
Rank 6 here. I can confirm that they are in the game and in their 1.12 state. 
---
The requirements for the blue pieces are:
---
Rank 7: gloves and hands
---
Rank 8: pants and chest
---
Rank 10: Helm and Shoulders.
---
It's a debuff that can be dispelled by the potion. So if the only magic effect on the warrior is a poly, the potion will remove it when it ticks. If the warrior has poly, detect magic, and imp cs then potion has a 1/3 chance of working.
---
Well I started at launch and I’m only 46. Hunter.

FD+FT doesn’t work anymore anyway. Shamefully.

Thanks! Can you please elaborate slightly on these so I can add them to the updated list in the OP?

Yeah, take this out. Please
---
Fair enough, but I think if a meme gets 1.8k upvotes  it shouldn’t be removed since people clearly liked it
---
Blizz needs incentives to fix this issue.
---
1. Keep track of the Alliance:Horde ratio.
---
2. Provide exp multipliers to both factions equal to the unbalanced ratio. The ratio should favor the minority and work against the majority.
---
3. Provide additional bonus' to the minority faction at target ratios. For example:
---
&gt; 1:2 = increase movement speed.
---
&gt; 1:3 = increase gold dropped from mobs.
---
&gt; 1:4 = increase chance of uncommon/rare/epic drops.
---
4. Similarly, provide debuffs to the majority faction. Consider reversing the order from above, and making the scalar value dependant on the actual ratio.
---
&gt; 2:1 = decrease chance of uncommon/rare/epic drops.
---
&gt; 3:1 = decrease gold from mobs.
---
&gt; 4:1 = decrease movement speed.
---
5. If the ratio is 1:2 or worse, grant the minority faction a spell to toggle their PvP flag. Keeping it toggled on grants a buff called 'Rally Cry of the [factionName]'. The buff increases in effect for each person around with the same buff.
---
This should provide enough incentive to get people to swap factions when the pros overwhelms the cons.
---
OP will mostly get "shuldve rolled a pve server", "go back to retail", "u made the choice now live with it or reroll on a pve server"
---
Atiesh is alliance dominated
---
right.. and re-do your escort quest. or wait another hour for a black lotus. Of course there's danger
---
Indeed if a weapon has +5 STR it is not already calculated in the weapon stat. However, checking your melee DMG on your character stat should reflect the correct calculated number vased on your STR value and wielded weapon.
---
Yeah, I was at work when I responded. Goofed it.
---
Any player like that isn't going to be getting far at all in this game, like I am skeptical that they would even get to the point where doing BWL would be an option for them.
---
Free Realm Transfer... why doesn't it offer a server in the same geographical zone with a lower pop? As a US East person I don't need raids times to be at midnight my local time...
---
The mage/rog matchup is one of the fairest ones tbh, but with pvp trinkets out now, it favors rogues. Especially if they use FAP.  
---
Rogues have 7 full outs to your novas slow, and on top of that stuns and gouge. 
---
2 blinds  
---
2 sprint (that remove slow and nova)
---
2 vanish  
---
1 trinket  
---
1 Free action potion maybe.  
---
Still mage with snap got a lot also, but if the rog get the opener on you, and then does his combos in 1v1, it is a really hard fight to win as a mage.  
---
You have to save your blocks for his blinds, meaning that you just have to take some of his damage, and you need to get a reset with sheep going, or you are basically screwed. And the issue now with pvp trinkets out, is that the rogue will just trinket that first sheep.
---
there is a lot of people like this like the people who still follow jokerdtv after what he did and said that is how kids are welcome to the humanity new gen classic
---
Awh that’s cute, Horde players crying about being ganked. 
---
*cries in 20 corpse runs to Blackrock Mountain*
---
Stay in denial. Cry more :)
---
Because my mates and I played alliance on a pserver so we decided to play horde here
---
That’s how it’s supposed to work, you can only cast traps out of combat. What do you mean?
---
IIRC you want :
---
60 mob : 5% hit
---
62 mob : 6% hit
---
63 mob : 9% hit
---
This assumes you have 300 weapon skill. 
---
Because fractional percentages don’t exist , I’d go for 6% on 61 mobs.
---
Except our server is fairly balanced, estimated to be 55H/45A. If you factor in that a couple of the large horde guilds are Chinese and korean, it's fairly balanced during peak PST hours.
---
Stop bitching and go back to retail
---
Im looking for opposing opinions and to discuss why i think im right and i think they are wrong. Maybe i change their mind, maybe they change mine. Its not really a worthwhile discussion if everyone agrees with each other. 
---
Thats called an echo chamber.
---
Its clearly sarcasm.
---
But what about no changes? Now that we have it do we not care about that? Remember, there’s another version of this game where horde and alliance are unable to gank endlessly and in mass.  I don’t want that again
---
Yoo i had exactly the same! And I'm grinding eye right now, have all the other pieces!
---
I still have no idea what an enbie is? A trans person?
---
I played wow classic. I got to 60 and was nice. But I quickly realized if I kept playing I was going to ruin the positive memories and nostalgia I have for the game. 
---
The world and internet was a different place back then. Nothing can recreate that innocence. 
---
RIP
---
I didnt like Classic i dont think ill like candy crush either. :(
---
Any other games you have to recommend? I do have some time to kill. lol
---
Real life deathmatch! last man breathing takes the guild
---
Why do you want to transfer back?
---
You have to spam click it. Also making sure /petpassive is in the macro because fd does not take your pet out of combat.
---
You mean, conspiring against you like Cedx against Asmon with some ditch raps to gain influence? lol
---
I mailed a hunter in vanilla and I never used a macro for it. I would just cast FT while I was FD, or maybe soon as I stood up, I don't remember exactly.
---
This is the answer, the true mark of a leader is finding people to complete tasks for you, if done right all you should have to do is manage these 3-4 officers and they will do the rest of the work (that they want to do anyway)
---
The 5% auction house would be a huge cut and i dont think most people would first look at the AH for their specific mount. I think it's best advtlertised in trade chat
---
I remember prices being double (or so) what they are now around the time TBC was released. I think the most i saw a stack of runecloth sell for pre TBC was 2g 20s on US/Arthas/Horde and US/Dethecus/Horde
---
Blood elf racials are not strong it’s a 2 second silence in melee range 
---
Yes it’s better than gift of the naruu but perception is much better in arena than it is now for example.
---
Wotf is much less relevant because pvp is less bursty with resilience 
---
Shadowmeld becomes useful to drink in stealth (tbc arena is a mama war)
---
That costs a pot CD so not the worst outcome.
---
Nostalrius died for this.
---
Photoshopped. There is no such thing happens on any PvP server. /s
---
I dunno what you're remembering bu my server was just this same nightmare.
---
It only took a 10 man to make a zone unplayable back then.
---
Ratios work in both directions.
---
Yeah you do. Even with my 3 man squad we pray endlessly on solo players, even low levels we need to get that honor. We are farming 2nd bracket on the server. So lots of killing to be done. Juicy 80 60 40 honor per kill is nice. Im sorry but you are just a resource like that silversage for me. Just have to wait for bgs. Im sorry but not sorry my gear just comes from pvp.
---
How is gold not relevant when we are talking about respeccing/dual specs?
---
There is a way to change your spec in game, it just requires a small amount of gold to do so. Not mentioning it would be to pretend that you cant change your spec at all
---
&gt;Those were changes that were absolutely necessary, not quality of life changes
---
Server size certainly wasn't an absolutely necessary change. They could have had more servers. They just thought it would be best. 
---
Using your logic, it's time to pack it in, servers are too busy, it's not classic, and we're on a slippery slope to retail.
---
But who's circlejerking about classic being a failure? I frequent this sub and I've yet to see one single post proclaiming that classic was a failure. You're offended on behalf of a multi billion dollar company, based on your own strawmen.
---
If by SM you mean scarlet monastery, its not even on a contested zone, its horde zone, thats why allies cant attack if they are with pvp off my dude.
---
And on the server where I play, allies were dominant for the most part of phase 1, and now its the other way around ¯\\_('-')_/¯
---
Awesome, so you're saying i should miss my raid because you couldnt work out how much of a giant clusterfuck PVP was going to be on a PVP server? Even if i dont actually enagage in the behaviour you dont like?
---
And you cant work out how that makes you just as bad as what you're complaining about.....
---
I also like the pug raider "no need for voice, I've cleared this every week ez".
---
So why are you playing classic instead of retail?
---
Really!? TIL, thank you!
---
&gt; Instead of ignoring the people who have been successfully playing this version of the game for a decade
---
You're the one who wants to change the game they are playing because you are getting shitwrecked.  I want to change it because the honor system is bad.
---
It is relevant and it's been addressed, you just don't seem to like the answer so you keep moving it around.
---
As I said in my other post, we're done talking. You've addressed nothing I've said, provided no actual argument yourself other than "retail bad", and it's gotten old.
---
You have fun now.
---
&gt; A faction specific queue sounds fine, until it's Tuesday night and you cant get on to raid because you're stuck in a queue. 
---
Oh, but plenty of Horde cunts on here have been giving us a solution that'd also solve this anyway! Just reroll :)
---
No change??? Look around lmao, the current game is not this #nochanges. Its completely different. For a start we have the same map, the same resources. These things were designed for less than a quarter of the population
---
I dont own a phone. I carry my PC on my back and a solar panel on my forehead while stealing Wifi from unsuspecting coffee shops so i can make my skype calls.
---
That's art
---
I disagree. A big part of Classic for me is spec and class/character identity and those decisions matter. 
---
Do I want a PvE build, a PvP build or something in between?
---
Also it makes sure that gold is still valuable.
---
Will have to play around with it, thanks.
---
It's a way to get gold out of the economy. AKA a gold sink
---
It is another way to reward players who deserve to be rewarded. (Putting in time to get gold, so you can respec more often to a perfect spec for the situation)
---
You only asked for one, but I just gave you two.
---
Iirc one of the interesting things was that the mobs are all... Easy. Like very easy. No weapons  and armor basically. No mechanics. 
---
So you can kinda just kill them all quickly. It’s decent xp but I’m not sure it’s much good for gold framing
---
and he cant reset with sheep
---
And you can see how the queuing idea does the exact same thing to others that you're complaining about people doing to you?
---
Lol are you serious
---
You're projecting your own ego onto them. I can gaurentee none of them feel as personally insulted by classic because that's nonsense.
---
It wasn't nearly this bad before honor, so that definitely has a lot to do with it
---
I Dunno, I watched the duel tournament with top players and I'm pretty sure void walkers were killed when warlock was Cc'd.
---
Damn flavoured druids.  I especially hate the tropical punch ones
---
We have no idea what server size was in vanilla. And neither does Blizzard. They've said in interviews server size was variable even back then. They already added more servers than what they initially announced. The reason they don't want to add more is because many of those servers would eventually become ghost towns, and they'd have to merge them. And if there's one thing people REALLY fucking hate, it's server merges. Goodbye to character names, to your guilds. Would that be a better alternative? No. 
---
Besides, people wanted an active world that feels busy and alive. Now you have it.
---
This doesnt even mention that on Horde dominated servers Horde always get world bosses and on alliance dominated servers the opposite is true.
---
This problem is going to get alot worse if blizzard doesnt do anything
---
What about shamans and paladins? Shit out of luck?
---
"stop challenging my idiotic suggestions, you dont answer anything"
---
"well here is an answ..."
---
"WE DONE TALKING"
---
You would think that, of all people, Blizzard would understand the unintended consequences of making a change like quadrupling the server population.
---
Horde = noobs
---
pickpocket BRD. just pickpocketing alone without killing bosses. u can net \~20g an hour. + all the rogue mats ull ever need from lockboxs. if ur geared enough and kill bosses u can push it to 30-40g an hour.
---
coffer keys depending if they arnt expensive on your server is also a nice way of getting gold. chancing getting a good blue /epic out of them
---
Not sure why all of these people are giving you wrong information but I see that you are a new player so Ill help you out.  :)
---
Faerlina is a ‘special server’ where both the factions ( allience and horde ) live in perfect peace and dont attack each other.  If you do in the very rare condition have someone attack you, which will almost never happen, dont fight back as that would flag you for PVP that will take 1 week to get rid of. Just let them kill you and they will not be able to attack you again for atleast a week.  For the faction of choice you should definately chose allience as that is where your friend and Asmongold plays and they are very friendly. :) For your class you should chose warrior as they are the fastest levelers and appropiate for new players. Also Asmongold plays it and he really likes it. :) I hope this long post helps you out! :D 
---
Be sure to not trust everyone on this site, some bad people like to waste others time, not sure why someone would do something like that - I hope you have a great time! &lt;3
---
If you're happy with what's happening on PvP servers right now then you were never interested in PvP, because you're either steamrolling the other faction with no skill or effort or you enjoy corpse running literal seconds after logging on.
---
People being ganked in IF/OG the second they log in, waiting 10 minutes to unflag so they can try and leave (if the flight master is alive... otherwise best wait for a mage to send you somewhere), then getting ganked and camped where they land the second they land is in no way good for the game at all. It is a serious problem for a huge number of players and if nothing is done those players will roll on a different server or quit, making the problem worse for everyone.
---
I don't have fun playing the game in it's current state, and I will not continue to pay for it, if you believe that to be melodramatic perhaps you should reassess your definition of that word. Kind of sad that it took you two hours to rub your two brain cells together and that's all you came up with.
---
Maybe roll PvE?
---
SM is in a horde zone. It should be hard to get into. Horde have the same issues with deadmines. You are clearly just a scrub.
---
I tried to post a workable solution to the problem below and NO ONE offered any critique of it. Just the same old mindless 'no changes' bullshit from people completely oblivious to the reality that the faction balance has changed, the pop numbers have changed, the world and technology and society outside the game has changed etc.
---
The answer is faction-specific queues to maintain balance and making repeatedly ganked players dishonourable kills for a short time which would work like the res timer to disincentivise camping and griefing. As it stands camped players are actually further punished by the current system with the res timer which is frankly ridiculous. Anyone who defends this either an idiot or just stands to benefit from the current griefing.

---
do u kill aany of the bosses. or u just straight pickpocket?
---
Right on! I'm glad FD+FT doesn't work anymore lol, it was being used a lot.
---
Hey, I'm not knocking the big servers, I think it's a great change :) 
---
What I disagree with is the 'no changes whatsoever for any reason at all, because any change whatsoever for any reason at all is a slippery slope to retail.'
---
And they don't scale with the AP buff from Onyxia head or DM tribute, and can only scale their DPS with a limited number of raid consumables compared to their competition.
---
That's really cool man, one of the great things about a gaming community. It still surprises me when people who plays with their parents.
---
Ah yes, content by popularity! In other words ^^^R^E^T^A^I^L
---
&gt; Can you just let the community be the judge of if it’s funny or not?
---
Every popular sub that tries this goes to shit real fast.
---
Thank you for all of the replies everyone! I have added the changes you have all identified to the opening post for a more complete list.   
---
Please forgive me for not citing you all individually for the changes you have added to this list. I did edit my post again to do this, but after adding the final username tag I tried to add a url hyperlink to a youtube video and it caused all my edits to be lost for some reason. I have gone back and added the video link but did not add all the user tags.
---
not sure why they are that big, on mine who isn't a serv with queue there is not much problem  except a bit of lag for wednesday head turn in and a bit if world bosses are at a time where people are up.
---
A 2 second silence is massive (it also gave back a small amount energy or mana), that's usually a big enough kill window for any decent team. 
---
Also a reason why it was nerfed in retail.
---
What is fap?
---
I really want Classic+ with that TBC feel. No flying though!
---
I'm against any changes besides visual ones or the absolutely necessary ones. If we're gonna add quality of life changes, they might as well add changes to make ret pallies not so dogshit. Etc etc
---
our MT uses eshankers claw. its Really good for threat generation 1.5 attack speed. and the proc to gain Even more attack speed? yeah. pretty gooood
---
Can you mind control someone and use them to kill goblins to tank their Steemwheedle rep?
---
Reminds me of randy marsh. Lets go bro cmon bro
---
I stopped today. Thats why i wrote the post and shared my experience and thoughts on the game. 
---
Ill pick up BFA tommorow.
---
Oh, look over there. A feminist Horde. :)
---
Did you guys try it without RP walking?
---
Thanks for that :). Please feel free to use this list as content for a new video if doing so is desirable
---
thanks!
---
Mh + offhand is better dps
---
&gt;Shame this post will be taken down
---
Wow yea such a shame the mods removed this post!!!! You are so right!!!
---
Yeah I was trying to decide if he was talking about some bug or people suck lol.
---
Serpent sting will keep you in combat Ive noticed.  
---
Other than that I dont have many issues with FD + Trap, in pvp or pve
---
&gt; These are all the same arguments that were made 15 years ago.
---
No it wasn't.  3k population servers were nothing like they are today
---
&gt;  To compensate, they no longer have legs and move at 50% speed.
---
They're already under frostbolt though...
---
&gt; The biggest issue atm is the msssive servers.
---
no, it's the massive faction imbalances
---
&gt; "stop challenging my idiotic suggestions, you dont answer anything"
---
&gt; "well here is ~~an answ...~~ me dodging the question, not answering anything and re-framing everything you say incorrectly over and over."
---
Just thought I'd fix that one up for you &lt;3.
---
Typical Shamen
---
Ol boy pulled $185 for 100G out his ass. It’s really affordable and although I personally do not support the action many of my friends have done so without consequences. 100% at your own risk.
---
I actually realized that afterwards, you can see me click on the warr... Sorry :x
---
I carry 2 stacks of ankhs, a little excessive but I can throw a couple at the idiots you dont want to use their abilities
---
Blizzard is so fucking slow on the faction queues it's disgusting and sad, at this point might as well just uninstall
---
We did this to our GM and ended up creating a new guild.
---
yes its edited ;)
---
I assume you’re throwing all your skins on the AH?  How is that going good wise?
---
Horde logo
---
Critical thinking is not your strong suit
---
Dear diary
---
Because you created your horde characters based on "If I go with the biggest faction on PvP server, which is trendy, I could gank players without being ganked back since I will be part of the majority. And I will still faceroll any solo Alliance with my 4pals with me. That's how I do WPvP."
---
Wait wtf lol how do you know what faction my friend is
---
Okay, so we open up transfers and do nothing to encourage the majority faction to leave. Now your 60-40 server becomes 70-30. The minority faction becomes camped even harder and the game becomes even more unplayable, so they leave and now you're at 80-20. Sounds much better than inconveniencing the faction griefing the entire planet!
---
People have changed. We used to play honorably. Now, we play for honor. Not honor in the traditional sense, mind you, but honor in that your existence carries value only so much in that you may die for another's gain. And they will hunt you mercilessly for that gain.
---
So reroll on a PvE server. Not because you are weak, or cannot PvP. But because the people who play the game have changed. There is no longer any honor, only death.
---
Same thing is still going on on Gehennas - Eu.
---
If you’re having second thoughts in Elwynn Forest then you should just stop now before you invest any significant time.  
---
I recently gave up on my warrior at lvl 53 with like 10 days /played.  Now I’m in alt hell and I’m months behind everyone.
---
Man in vanilla i got ravager on my hunter and i remember just melleing in wsg w no pet the whole bg
---
Wow bro I’m sorry for that! Come to the horde I’ll help you out
---
The traditional answer was to go grind gorillas/cats in STV + skinning.
---
140AP, 10% spell crit, 5% melee and ranged crit, 2hr duration.
---
It's better to just vendor them when lvling, AH nets you basically the same amount for more effort.
---
Guilds don't want 8 Restoration Shaman in their raids, so the Enhance Shaman is not taking a slot of a Restoration Shaman, this has always been a false argument point.
---
The more groups that can have totems, the better, as the Totems + The Shamans raid contribution is higher than another DPS contribution when combined.
---
The Enhance Shaman is not providing Grace of Air to 5 people not 4 because it affects the caster. Also, because Grace of Air is agility, not flat critical strike bonus, it also is providing attack power, which you do not account for.
---
The Enhance Shaman can provide Nightfall buff without sacrificing their own DPS to do it. In your suggestion a Warrior gives up dual wielding to provide Nightfall and a Hunter gives up using their bow, where as with an Enhance Shaman there is no compromise.
---
Again your entire post is built on a false premise of Enhance Shaman taking the slot of a Restoration Shaman, when really the Enhance Shaman is taking the slot of a DPS.
---
These threads really validate my PvE realm choice. I remember being ridiculed for it "don't be such a wuss and roll a PvP server - the way it's meant to be played" - and here we are, whine thread after whine thread. Vindication.
---
I'd recommend warrior If you're on a pve server.
---
that's what i was doing i only sell like wool cloth and silk and stuff on ah and maybe some greens blues and rings
---
&gt; Take your 40 non elite guards *that are only on the docks anyway* and like it.
---
ftfy
---
I don't watch anime.
---
Classic specs has legitimate hard counters to each other, so I’m sorry but you will have to get used to losing to a mage 49/50 times always :)
---
Classic PvP was never fair lol.
---
Can confirm, just vendoring trash and trash greens from questing starts to get much more impactful post 36, and as mentioned by others various drops from elementals sell very well, but if you feel lucky you could try the whelps in wetlands/swamp of sorrows. The pet, while rare for both, can sell for quite a bit, but they also drop Small Flame Sacs, which have been going for 1-2G, and they drop at a decent rate
---
2-4G on my server, and hitting about 5G~ on Wednesdays.
---
Definitely a good thing to grind, a stack of 10 alone is basically half your mount.
---
Or r/apexlegends
---
Good one i will check that out too!
---
Lol. Buddy. You are living in a fantasy world if you think that queues will actually be 1hr. Cross realm bgs are gonna make them pop in 15 mins tops. Go cry more.
---
Yes, cross-over with other realms with also imbalanced factions (ofc Horde dominated faction).
---
&gt; But who's circlejerking about classic being a failure?
---
Quite a lot of people in here, especially since P2.
---
&gt; You're offended on behalf of a multi billion dollar company
---
Unfortunately I still fail to see what exactly indicated that I have a positive opinion about them.
---
You made the statement that they're a shadow of the company it once was and I wrote that technically it isn't, since they're doing well if measured in actual numbers. Not sure why you get all worked up over my comment.
---
I know, same idea applies. Sinking too much time into an item that doesn't pay for itself.
---
Or just don’t play on PvP servers.
---
Yup! Easy and invaluable for raiding
---
They’re opening with mind blast because that’s what their solo rotation is and they’re too dumb to realise they need to adapt in a party.
---

Back in vanilla when I dueled warriors, I never used blizzard.  There was never any need.  It's just a really tough match-up for warriors.

---
Only 2hrs? I would say, more than 6hrs.
---
I guessed it when I saw that your friend liked Asmongold and because I actually read what you wrote. As you can see I am only here to help you out. :)
---
imagine being on a pvp server
---
This subreddit has already become r/wow. It’s too late
---
Ok
---
They're called *dock*workers not *ship*workers.
---
Spam sunder armor than go to town.
---
false
---
it is entirely the ratios
---
if a server was 50/50 youd still die in the world but your own faction would provide a lot of breathing room that doesnt exist when the other faction controls everything w/ way more ppl
---
To play with my friends
---
Kill every beast you see and sell the grey drops and leather.
---
Evey ally on every other pvp server feels your pain nonstop joyless game time.
---
Being a shaman player, seeing Hunters with Ravager always makes me somewhat angry :P
---
Cringey fuck playing 80/20 realm
---
That's why I said it drops if you do ANYTHING other than mount. That includes accepting a summon, drinking, buffing, clicking on a vendor. Anything. The mount is allowed so you can get some distance.
---
He is smoking that A1 giggle bush.
---
Don't feed the troll people.
---
&gt; Awesome, so you're saying i should miss my raid because you couldnt work out how much of a giant clusterfuck PVP was going to be on a PVP server?
---
Why are you making this all about yourself?
---
me me me me me me me me me
---
The whole world revolves around you. You're doing the exact same thing you're accusing others of. You want thousands of other people to have a shitty experience so that you can have a good one. I don't have a problem with you acting in self-interest, I have a problem with your holier than thou attitude about it, like you're somehow above it and aren't above making sure "random people are inconvenienced" so that you can have a good time. 
---
No one is punishing you. I know you have a crippling victim complex but please understand that. Nobody is targeting you. This isn't about you. Nobody is going, "Boy, can't wait to make sure /u/speshnz can't make raid night tonight because fuck him." We're saying, when there's literally 40:1 gank squads going around, maybe, hey, *maybe*, the 1 should have an opportunity to get backup before the 40. 
---
Guess what, every private server did this. Guess what, people still made their raid nights, because all it did was turn a Horde queue from 12 minutes into 20 minutes as some alliance got ahead of them, or vice versa. The world didn't come crashing down. I promise.
---
The Honor system was designed to be a grind.  The top .1% get to be rank 14.  Capping honor would put everyone at the same cap and would completely break the honor system.
---
That actually sounds really cool! What server are you on? Thinking about re-rolling at this point or at least holding out for a transfer.
---
people discussing these stuff, being \`manager\` in a game. this is a joke right?
---
I had been, pretty unsuccessfully, farming dreamfoil in azshara to fuel my mana pot addiction, checking the more northern 2 essence of water spawns about once every few laps.  The folks farming the satyrs up there were not friendlies, and were being rather aggressive.    
---
So when my buddy asks me to run his alt through BFD I jumped at the change of pace.  I hearth and hop the FP to Ashenvale.    
---
I'm running through Ashenvale and a level 20 gnome stops in the road and spits on me.    
---
So I beat him to death with my fishing rod, and ate his tasty tiny body.    
---
gl out there.
---
Take that gold and buy a million elemental earth, and stock them for AQ.
---
Back then it was just to look cool imo lol
---
Learn how to read. Huntard logic will say it is
---
Lmao yeah, imagine not just releasing BG's at the same time as world PvP, imagine deciding against allowing people to engage in consensual, even and fair PvP combat and instead forcing them to get farmed like a mob. I'm convinced they're trying to drive people to retail.
---
Link your staff so we can look it over and see if it is a good one.
---
Yea, we have been doing open roll among priests thus far, but the guy who got it two weeks ago still hasn’t gotten benediction (last week was a hunter). I’m hopeful I’ll get some pity from other priests if they know I already have other eye.
---
i put a brief reply in.
---
Yes but if you don't do a bulk of the DMG you won't get much if someone is carrying you so though the kill. Same with dungeons I found when ever I had a player 9+ levels above me join my XP was nerfed.
---
\*rolls eyes\*
---
You only got to level 30. You didn't get to see any of the fun stuff. But if you hate it this much you wont like it at 60 either. Just play BFA. It sounds like the right game for you.
---
Oh, I'm sure. I'm mostly joking anyway, I've run around with some pretty weird gear myself back then (and honestly, probably still today as well).
---
That said, I did just recently see a dwarf hunter with ravager. Angry glares ensued.
---
What... is the point... of writing messages... like this...

Also, what a cancerous stance to have.

Yeah the fact that WoWs subs tripled when classic came out was just a coincidence. ;)
---
We have a lock in our guild called Stickynugs as well. I thought he hopped ship for a second and got mad as hell
---
Horde gets as much honour as they can; Alliance gets as much honour as they want.
---
You have two options. 1) delegate more responsibilities to them, or 2) kick them. Myself? I would kick. The mistrust is already seeded. Not much you or they can do to come back from what’s already been said. Be wary, they may already be turning others against you.
---
This goes true for both factions. Horde can not play on Alliance dominant servers, much like how the Alliance can not play on Horde dominant servers.
---
I can not understand how anyone who is dominant in their server can even begin to defend what is going on. I am an Alliance on a massively Horde dominant server and I am just as disgusted by fellow Alliance players treating the Horde like the Horde treats the Alliance on my server.
---
Apologies, I did indeed mean Vanilla.
---
&gt; stop crying
---
I was not crying. I rolled on a pve server. But I've seen many alliance folks cry over pvp.
---
As someone who started playing right before legion (and basically only played legion), I feel like you aren’t playing the game right. Now don’t get me wrong, I will agree that if you tried playing by yourself, with no one else in the server, retail would obviously be way more fun than classic. But unlike in retail, where I think I might have spoken to all of 5 people, and remember only 1 interaction with another player that stood out to me, classic is literally all about the community. I got to know people in that initial run through the Barrens, and seeing them around in game really feels like running into old friends. A single buff from a good-guy Priest could save your life down the road, and the one nelf in Arathi that helps you farm ele fire is now the most generous and kind being on the face of Azeroth as far as you care.
---
Retail became retail because they took away the things that created the need for player interaction, and Classic has to be hard, because hardship breeds altruism.
---
But that’s just like...my opinion...mon
---
If OP's server is anything like mine, level 60s have the elemental farming spots on lock.
---
I disagree because if you actually had real friends they wouldn’t care. Maybe if you stopped being a douche all the time maybe you’d have some.
---
Got it, bubble up and drink to keep AoE aggro.
---
Delete LW it’s a useless prof. Thank me later

this is the post of the post you guys are talking about. Seems pretty legit though.
---
I once one healing a BRD group, we all showed up and were waiting for maybe 15 minutes as we were looking for a tank. We finally find a tank, when all of a sudden i get kicked, apparently the tank wanted to bring his friend in. I wasnt even angry, just numb, i was shook.
---
BRM is still an utter hellhole, although it changes hand back and forth. And there are ganksquads roaming in the end game zones. Don't think that'll end til BGs come out.
---
It's a really stupid rule, and the mods enforce it in a really bad way. I made a meme about leveling a warrior. I took screen caps from a show, put them together, added my own text, and got 200 upvotes in an hour. It was deleted, without any comment or message from the mods; I'm assuming for rule 7.
---
Just because it doesn't have screenshots from WoW doesn't mean it's low effort. There's no subjectivity and it removes a lot of good content (not my own, I see tons of great memes that only live for a few hours).
---
 [https://ironforge.pro/servers/](https://ironforge.pro/servers/)

I've seen flash heal used in raids. In our raid it was in fast fights like shazzrah for example. Especially that one actually, there's a ton of damage being taken and you won't run out of mana anyway.
---
Congrats! That joke of an excuse the gm wrote in the other post says alot about the guild overall.
---
Avoid dank budz collection on gehennas.
---
never been this triggerd by a wow clip...when i did my bene quest all the priests cheered each other from all factions each time someone passed. we in horde supported the ones who failed in whispers as well, feels really rough failing it knowing you fucked others up as well. cant even comprehend this griefers persona_irl, what a fucking douche
---
...What? The Horde zep from Org to UC is contained entirely within the Horde friendly zones of Duratar and Tirisfall. Horde can *literally not be attacked* on that flight unless they intentionally pvp flag themselves. 
---
Meanwhile, the tram is contested territory where Alliance are always flagged.
---
Lmao, gonna talk to the the GM.. LMAO. 
---
U deserve it, snitches get stitches, or in this case waste 12 hours for nothing, what's the matter with u ? Lulz
---
Uhh Dungeons were the way the level starting around 30 in phase 1....
---
It's fucking horrible. We raided tonight and pull timers didn't work, threat meters didn't work, addons that said anything in chat for raid warnings didn't work.
---
That's why humans are much worse than animals. Actually the worst living being in the universe. Animals do bad things to survive, humans because they're a piece of shit and it's an entertaining for them.
---
At least the one person has a dad. Mine is still out getting milk
---
Pick pocketing. It's literally free money. Next to mages, rogues have hands down the easiest gold farming methods. Sure you won't be getting as much gold per/hr as a mage would but it requires 0 skill and you can basically do it afk once you get good enough at it
---
10 minutes? Those are rookie numbers, last week on Herod it was a 30 minute delay between head turnin and the buff going out. Curious what it was today, sadly I was busy
---
Almost anything you can do will generate threat. At the start of a fight the chances are that no one else did anything yet, so any little thing can pull a mob to you. Do things before the fight, or during the fight, but try to avoid doing anything when it’s starting.
---
Please tell me you're not going to attempt to get the main hand through pugging.

I wish I could reach through the screen and touch their dick off

You have no idea how misguidedly arrogant you sound, do you?

Trust me, us horde do not enjoy this at all...its boring af, the only reason people do it is cuz theres no other better way to grind honor. Some guys are just really serious about hitting rank 14 no matter how unfun it is.

---
Well tbf the average horde raider isnt really on the side that gets farmed in p2
---
Imagine thinking what horde does here is pvp.
---
Honour ruined vanilla, and it's ruining classic.
---
And you are missing the point in your desperation to feel superior to others. 
---
The issue is simply that the PvP isn't enjoyable because of various factors. 
---
Your ad-nauseum response is as asinine as me complaining about the food I got at a restaurant I went to and you going "well you went to a restaurant and got food, what's the problem? What did you expect?". 
---
The problem is that I wanted good food and instead got an inedible mess that wasn't remotely close to being as enjoyable as the meal I got when I went to that restaurant 15 years ago. 
---
Its nothing to do with being "soft", but keep telling yourself this and living in your little bubble if you must.
---
I am not getting killed much. But only a little 42.  Probably changes at higher levels.
---
There would be exactly zero reasons to rank below r11 if the vlue sets weren't updated so imo it's a good change.
---
Deviate fish and oily black may not be worth fishing as a 60 for income, but I bet it's better gold per hour than most things a lvl 35ish can do now that the servers have decent economies.
---
Next time just kick them. If you aren't group leader then drop group and form your own. You'll be done long before they find a replacement tank.
---
Brd solo farms:
---
- pp the ring, tavern, most dwarves on the way (sometimes it's not worth to detour to get 1-2 pp) (PvP spec is better for this as you will get resisted 5% of the time and when you do you HAVE TO wait for vanish CD or else you risk wiping and losing money),
---
- kill all solo fire elementals patroling along the way that are 55 or lower,
---
- learn to solo kill Pyromancer (adrenaline rush is best for this, but it's doable with PvP dagger spec),
---
- pp all dwarves in tavern,
---
- in the tavern, buy the alcohol from the bartender and throw it 1 at a time at a corner and kill the patrons before they get to touch it, repeat till you run out of beer,
---
- solo kill guzzler (very easy once you get a hang of LOSing him),
---
- vendor ur junk and proceed to the coffers,
---
- on the way through Fineous mine the dark iron node (you have to stand on it to not get spotted),
---
- open 11 of 12 coffers (buy coffer keys for 25s max),
---
- reset the instance using your alt (running back is quite difficult amyways).
---
It will take you at least 1 day/night of wiping and corpse running to learn how to do this, but don't give up just yet, it's very possible. Gear I used when I started this was Król Blade (although Thrash Blade should be good enough) + Mirah's both with Crus, pre-raid BiS or their lesser alternatives, 3,3-3,6k hp + 1 Superior pot per boss. No raid gear required.
---
Optional:
---
- I think it might be possible to kill Incendius once you get better gear, and possibly the packs of 2 fire elementals in his area,
---
- it might be possible to open the bug reward coffer if you have improved sap and can open the wanted poster without getting aggro -- supposedly some of the mini bosses are easy to solo,
---
- smelt some dark iron ore, but it might not be worth the trouble as prices are dropping,
---
- learn how to solo angerforge with the ledge cheese (impossible for gnomes afaik, jump sucks) and sell HoJ to people.
---
And most importantly get friends and run dungeons with them. Do Strat for orbs, organize runs and reserve stuff, and so on.
---
Invest your gold instead of buying random greens for your alt.
---
(PP will provide you endless supply of poison mats, blinding powder, h-pots - sell major ones on AH, use Superior for yourself.)
---
That's only one of the ways you could be making gold.
---
And if you have to spend 4-5g on repairs after a dungeon... Well bad news - you are doing something terribly wrong.
---

---
Word, that’s really a great point.
---
I should have said that, in my opinion, the way you framed your original post comes off as confrontational. Specifically the way that you claim your opinions as facts and dismiss the posters who are calling you out on it. I think that it makes you look foolish and detracts from the legitimacy of your review.
---
I must say that I agree with a lot of your points however. I have a deep love for the game and the experiences that I had with my friends while playing it, but this game is essentially all grinding and that just doesn’t hold my attention like it used to. More power to the subscribers who are still super into the game though. I’m honestly a little envious.
---
Not being able to chat in global channels is awful.
---
Also we aren't getting system messages in Gehennas - so second night in a row we've had a server restart/shutdown with no notification.
---
The fact there's been no official response to this is absolutely disgusting.
---
I love that I got downvoted here. Oh salty tears. Don’t roll pvp and cry about the pvp, Either get the F over it, or reroll PvE. Just stop whining. That’s for babies. Are you all babies?
---
You simply didnt give honor lol
---
OP , this is a good suggestion. I levelled with herb/skinning and farming these elementals were better gold then anything else. Empty your bags as much as humanly possible, find the area of rock elementals closest to your level, and kill them until your bags are full. Send the white quality items stones to a bank alt to AH and vendor everything else. The grey items vendor for a lot.
---
I will note that this is much better for casters since the elementals have high armor but my hunter friend and I did this for about 2 full levels from 37+ and were making at least 10g/hr.
---
Ok have fun
---
DBC and fucking Banan TV. Instant leave from.dungeon group if some of those are in it.
---
BRD torch room?
---
Well yeah, the issue isn't entirely faction balance.. there's 3-4 times as many players on the servers as vanilla, yet the world is exactly the same size. No matter where you go, there are raids of the other faction riding around murdering the crap out of everything.
---
On servers with a wild population imbalance the issues are *far* worse for one faction than the other, but it's a problem everywhere.
---
Can you do this with a regular mount? Might bring my mage here to grind through the 50s
---
np, enjoy ur hard content where u couldn't kill horsemen with 4 tanks and few damage dealers on warriors and not even understanding what it is about
---
I was, but quit doing that around run number 70ish after losing it for the third time. My guildies have bee helping me for the last 34 runs.
---
Faction queues wouldn't fix the issue. 
---
On paper it works, but in reality it is a bit more complicated: 
---
- Would a level 1-50 alliance/horde count as population? 
---
- How would you score a player as population, they could be level 60 but in greens. Item level? 
---
- The meta will just shift to horde required to have 2 accounts with 1 level 60 alliance and 1 level 60 horde, log into the alliance toon and multibox the horde toon and then disconnect on the alliance toon. 
---
It isnt as simple as just saying "just implement faction queues 4Head"
---
You mean the Horde is thriving.
---
Yeah, that’s true. As a finn I just assume you have 4G coverage everywhere but depending on your country you might not be as lucky.
---
It's a joke, not a dick. Don't take it so hard.
---
servers are so laggy that it doesnt work, as ur not actually supposed to be out of cobat when u FD but u are for a split sec and then u can freeze trap. Doesnt work in wpvp if too many there ive noticed
---
We're in the process of clarifying / re-writing Rule #7. The basic idea is, if the image is just a generic meme that is unrelated to Classic, even if it has a text overlay, we remove it. We went back and forth on this and even had a survey for the subreddit asking what people thought of our enforcement of this rule; the majority didn't care, thought we were moderating appropriately, or wanted us to moderate harsher. People asking us to loosen up on meme removals were the minority.
---
**However,** we do listen to feedback. I'm replying now specifically to make sure you (u/swe93) know we've seen this post. I'll pass it along to the rest of the team. I'm not sure we'll make any changes based on this post, but I'll continue to read through comments and see what ideas people have. I (and the entire team) genuinely would like the subreddit to be as good of a resource as possible for the Classic community.
---
I'll tell you how I got mine as a level 40 horde warrior. (If you're ally this is easier) 
---
Step 1. go into strangelthorn 
---
Step 2. Kill the tigers/Panthers closest to your level (the ones next to the alliance city are lower meaning you could do this at your level more safely) 
---
Step 3. Dont quest. Just grind
---
I grinded those tigers for 5 levels and got the gold pretty easy. Bonus gold if you have the recipe for the tiger meat. It's not hard just time consuming. Goodluck
---
1 has the gbank? monkaS
---
USA, Kentucky specifically. Luckily, broadband across the state is actually being worked on actively and is planned to be finished by 2022, politics keeps delaying it because nobody wants to pay for it, but at least it's happening!
---
Man wow is truly full of manchildren.
---
Anyway, the honor meatgrinder you call pvp is not what pvp servers are about even and it's mostly been a shitfest. On any imbalanced server anyway.
---
Wpvp with the goal of farming honor has always been a garbage system, that's why it got killed off so early on. The real fun pvp server stuff happened before the honor system was in imo. And will continue happening, epsecially once bgs are out and finally it's not just a bg in a game without bgs.
---
Hey, not sure why my post was removed. It’s funny and accurate to classic culture. The rules for the server are so broad and general, that it appears to allow mods the ability to remove anything that they personally see fit, as opposed to things that should truly be removed.
---
Let people laugh a little.
---
The downfall of MMOs has always been "BUT WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?"
---
Because only 60s can BG?  How does that even make sense?
---
You can kill Plugger in the bar without too much difficulty, should be easy at 60. Look up a how-to on YouTube. He usually drops about 2g worth of stuff. I've been doing it since 55 because I wanted the dagger, but with world pvp the way it is I've found it's also a good way to make gold. 
---
Just be warned that attacking him makes the bar hostile so it's annoying if you want to include the bar in your pickpocketing circuit.
---
So many contradictions
---
I find succubus to be fantastic against rogues. And if you're concerned with it being killed, you can keep it stealthed and on stay in a random location ~20 meters or so away.
---
You're obviously squishier, but it screws up their opener and allows you to restart the fight on your own terms once they're caught in the seduce.
---
yea getting to choose to spend points on an item is way worse than having someone tell you what you need great point.
---
I have killed him before. I didnt know.
---
Pve aka normal realms people! The shit is smooth and easy.
---
You're being disingenuous. Orc/Undead racial are absurdly broken.
---
You can tell schools are out this week. I play at work, so I’m on most mornings. This is the first time I’ve ever seen 5-6 horde riding the boat between menethil and theramore at 9am. They’ve been there for the past two days, same people, for hours. Ganking solo people multiple times as they zone and auto res.
---
A free realm transfer is available for your server/faction.
---
Yeh this is 100% memeing. That’s like a straight copypasta but swapped words to make it relevant
---
don't report anything, i might get in trouble :)
---
Conflag is a little more dependant on Succubus seduce and SL's Master Demonologist may help you access your optimal pet sooner (eg double Void Sacrifice) but I think they're only barely more micro-dependant than your general SM/Ruin build, where you'll still want to have your pet auto attack and occasionally use their situational abilities.
---
You guys deserve more thanks. So thank you.
---
So again, if everyone followed your advice of 1) not rolling alliance and 2) not rolling on a pvp server what would all the other horde be doing?  Circle jerking each other?
---
&gt; I've never casted it as a mage
---
yikes
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Yeah they're practically shitting 24/7. They wake up several times during the night just to shit.
---
Yeah, seriously. Classic's far from a faithful recreation from day 1.
---
My favorite example is Dungeon and Raid difficulty. This was *definetly* harder back then, and the patchnotes back it up. Strat especially was nerfed again, again and again. 
---
1.12 Talents and itemization are also ridiculous. Spellcasters are so much stronger than back then thanks to spellpower actually *existing*.
---
Yet I still *really* love this game. It's fun as hell and I wouldn't give it up despite the unfaithfulness.
---
this is an absurd exaggeration lolol  
---
a good gnome mage with FAP beats average frost mage every time
---
Knew it was alliance before reading gnome
---
I have had okay luck with heavy leather but it depends on the time of week
---
Just because you don't like it you think it's fair to change it for everyone else? There is also no way to know if it will change or not, allthough I bet it will be much less activity then it is now.
---
That's really interesting.
---
I remember blessing of salvation feeling almost mandatory in TBC, is it because I was a rogue with combat potency (that also spent a good while rocking latro's)?
---
&gt; TL:DR - Fix your game, Blizzard. Many of us want to play and don't feel we should be punished for population ratios we cannot control.
---
They did fix this issue. 
---
That's one of the reasons they did server mergers in Retail. 
---
They can take a server like you have, and then a server that has the opposite problem, merge them and balance it all out. 
---
But this is what you guys wanted. Classic warts and all.
---
Sorry you're not having a good time, but you have some options available to you. 
---
You can go to a server that is more balanced or you can go to a pve server.
---
because then they get all the big name multi class items while also getting free other loot.  Druids and paladins and any other tweener lower pop class is going to have a huge advantage on sought after items if they have to pay nothing for their gear.
---
&gt; Im just stating that it's hunter bis just as much as it is rogue or war bis.
---
Except for a rogue or warrior it is very very very much more important of a slot to fill. Technically it's not hunter BiS at the moment and won't be until the 15 agi one hand enchant is in game, but they are still BiS for Rogues and Warriors *right now*. You seem to really take it personally, which to me is a bit ridiculous.
---
Totally incorrect. Since honor was introduced I haven’t had a single trip to BRD without corpse running for at least 30 minutes to get there. Horde always control Thorium point into BRD except for short bursts where alliance roll through once and leave immediately.
---
I'd stick the shaman on ignore, he must be allergic to learning if he's done it before.
---
He's talking about the spell queuing system.  
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753736043
---
Not sure why folks would expect anything different. Both sets of players are ultimately cut from the same general cloth, there's just some difference in preferences.
---
I don't think anything can fix retail WOW. So thankful to have Classic WOW.
---
5 focus/s. The BM talent makes it 6 focus/s, which barely makes a difference.
---
Would be greater if it was true.
---
When you do solo DM N Tribute as a Hunter, you constantly feign death (your pet gets aggro but only passively from existing), then you can drink and you get back into combat but you do not get aggro.
---
Unpopular Opinion: 
---
I honestly feel if intervention with the Spy addon happened a lot of good would happen for anyone—regardless of faction—because it adds such a stupid advantage to the game that takes away any sort of surprise and only makes it worse for players on the short end of an imbalance. This wouldn’t require blizz to do anything with the game structure or make any changes to the game itself.
---
Try walking backwards as a gnome and listen to the footsteps
---
&gt; For the purposes of WoW, stealth/invisibility seem synonymous
---
The keyword is "seems", even tho I would disagree there since only Rogues and Druids can stealth (and freely switch between both modes out of fight) while invisibility only exists for the Succubus or over a potion you have to buy. Idc what Blizzard has made canon in the 14th addon, [its not the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1fg2e/didnt_read_the_fine_print/f8oluvs/) and while it might seem reasonable to confuse this as a new player, it is only reasonable when not knowing other classes abilities (and/or that the invisibility potion exists).
---
The most important thing in games are always keywords, "stealth" isnt "invisibility" just because its not the exact same word. Magic is not a Curse for the exact same reason even tho both are casted by the same person and Mages/Druids can Iceblock/Shapeshift while silenced. Next thing is a Rogue "poisoning your eyes" with Blind, yep pretty reasonable.
---
No matter how reasonable some things might seem its important to know the difference it makes within the game. Just because something is reasonable doesnt mean it works that way within the game and there is no need to make wrong statements (like implying  "stealth" and "invisibility" are synonyms which is not the case in any language I know). The best thing you can do is taking the description of spells literally and figuring out how they work from there.
---
I made one the other day because I didn't realize it was a rule.. because it's not really enforced well
---
I don't mean to bash the mods.. and I don't think memes should invade the sub, but maybe find a middle ground.. like Sunday Memedays or something. 
---
Leave the discussion and complaining during the work week when people are more likely to be distraught
---
Your guild leader should google the debuff priority system and waddle his butt down the hole he crawled out of
---
&gt; I don't know if the people complaining just weren't there for this in vanilla
---
They clearly weren't. There's no value in playing on a PvP server and the game is at a point now where the newest content release is a reward system for killing the opposite faction.
---
Gee, I wonder what people are doing on PvP servers right now? Clearly the game is broken in unintended ways and this is just a big mistake, right guys?
---
ive been saying for a while now that spy should be completely banned. takes away from all the fun
---
It didn’t happen, it was a hoax.
---
Bored player hang around even when bored, because at 60 with an epic mount there's not that much to do when waiting for raids.
---
Being one of the minority faction who is unable to play will result in them either changing servers, re-rolling or finding something else to do.
---
yea i agree with this post, barely ever check here anymore as its only drawings or irrelevant stuff.
---
i dont mean to sounds elitist by this but is there a subreddit for people who are in the end game and actually want to share things of interest etc
---
PvP on a PvP server. What did you expect?
---
Uhh yeah I would never use something that's that far from any semblance of a finger. It would suck to try to find herbs or zoom out when you get jumped and are zoomed in or pretty much a hundred other situations.
---
How so? If they followed #nochanges we would have servers with caps at 3,500 not 10,000...
---
Picked a druid to avoid that, you can use literally dozens of spells (maybe 2 dozen) on a pull
---
Would have quit by now if I picked a class with a 3 button rotation
---
How DARE s/he drink that water!
---
There are some other 1.2 AS pets as well, including a worg from shadowfang keep.   BT seems a bit overrated.
---
Not OP, but after some searching I found this one that looks legit: https://wago.io/OXlZupyKm
---
lmao you are even an example of this rule yourself 
---
&gt;I prefer forming a hunting party of 3-5
---
&gt;we roll over solo players but more often we find a group of two or three and have a fun little fight.
---
let me guess when they have 5-7 they are mercilessly zerging you down with no skill involved whatsoever
---
&gt; regulating faction balance
---
They didn't do it in Vanilla, and everyone said they didn't want any changes. Layering was bad enough, remember?
---
&gt; increasing server population far beyond what it used to be
---
This isn't a strong talking point because it only increases the amount of players. Lowering the cap wouldn't fix faction balance issues. 
---
&gt; incentivising pvp without releasing battlegrounds at the same time
---
Correct me if I am wrong here, but I thought people loved Classic because it had wpvp and that's what everyone had hard dicks about. Is that not ***exactly*** what everyone was asking for? 
---
Are you suggesting that it's too much? 
---
&gt; keeping the honorable kill level difference at 12 levels.
---
Isn't that what it was in Vanilla? 
---
&gt; As someone who loves to pvp, the current situation is extremely frustrating, because fair fights are just not a thing.
---
FAIR FIGHTS WERE NEVER A THING AND NEVER HAVE BEEN. 
---
Is this a joke? No one engages in fair fights in wpvp. ***EVER***. 
---
Do you really want a fair fight in pvp? Go do fucking Arena in retail. That's about as fair a fight as you can hope for.
---
If only I had known those cleaning people were so bloodthirsty. I was at least 20 yards away not engaged at all and they said screw it this guys dying.
---
Had to have 300 IQ to see this coming.
---
Yeah and then you get killed again when you load into the other continent, don't make it back to your corpse before the boat leaves, corpse crosses continents, rez, get killed. Repeat.

I was soloing the tenaris one on my 48 alliance warlock and a 51 orc warrior was trying to grief me. I killed him 5 times a long the way and had a few really close calls. He wouldn't give up. I could see the palm trees at steamwheedle and got really excited. I had spent over 20 minutes on this quest because I had to move so slow. Tauren warrior lvl 60 kills me before I can finish. I could SEE the port. Oh well at least I got 500 honor out of it.
---
Mate, it's still a God damned video game. Gkick them and move on with your life and let them do theirs...
---
Oh oops, misread and thought it said it drops WHEN you mount
---
The 5-sided thing that looks like a coffin at a glance I think.
---
Why would a raid camp somewhere they don't get any honor?
---
You don't understand how good 1.0 attack speed is against casters.  It's amazing and worth the grind.  
---
Thankfully, I got it because I chose to stay up from 11 pm to 6 am and the place was empty at 6 am.  I can't imagine someone stealing it just out of spite, I would probably give up and convince myself it isn't worth it.
---
Do you actually want to see change to the games current state or are you happy as it is?
---
It's OK, you don't have to get it.
---
Oh this is a 10/10 post right here. Shilling for blizzard and going full boomer at the same time
---
Just have a warrior friend run into a group of mobs, do nothing and then give him a big heal.
---
Transfer to Heartseeker.
---
No body used it.  I say this as someone who was Rank 14 Shadow Priest.  And it didn't work like you say.  Might need to look up the condition called "false memories."
---
If someone is an irredeemable asshole then it's the one thinking that just playing the game makes you irredeemable asshole. You'd do the exact same thing if your faction was heavily outnumbering the other faction and you wanted to rank up.
---
Anyone who's using soul link on their imp is a total idiot. The thing barely has 900 health and would die instantly.  
---
And for dungeons where encounters are short but frequent improved firebolt is a much bigger DPS gain than shadowburn.
---
&gt;mages should be warriors, warriors should beat rogues and rogues should beat mages.  
---
This is not even close to how the game works my dude. Rogues beat warriors, as do mages. Mages mostly beat rogues. Nothing really beats mages.
---
Work the auction house. You’re in good shape so far. Just hit 40 on my character with 108g. Always have a batch of things to put on the AH. Cloth, stacks of leather, BOE greens, ingredients etc. Vendor all trash.
---
Ask me that in phase 6. The game is already on track to change 4 more times. I’m okay with letting it play out.
---
It’s not because of one comment made at a convention you idiot
---
It is a team of developers who have been working on BFA and whose egos won’t allow them to admit that a 15 year old game did things better than their modern version
---
How do you interrupt something you can't hit?
---
If we assume I have FAP we have to assume he has LIP. So now what?
---
Thanks
---
How many times are you going to repost the same whine?
---
You got told off the first time. Nothing has changed in a couple hours.
---
Holy (Priest) + Holy (Paladin). ULTIMATE HOLINESS. FEAR MY HEALS!
---
There is no way this is punishable griefing.  In fact, only one of these players is cursing and yelling at the other.
---
I lolled, but its true - WoW is filled with these
---
Seems like this would fall under same faction griefing which is a punishable offense in the same way as intentionally suiciding on Kazzak to prevent a competing same faction from getting the kill.
---
He intentionally interfered with your tame after you had already engaged and begun taming it. I'd submit a ticket.
---
Glad I got out during the blitzchung thing and back to pservers. The nostalgia was fun for a while, but I knew we weren't going to be playing the game like we did back in 2004.
---
2head take
---
How does killing the server fix it? If there are 80% one faction and 20% the other that means the population of that 20% is very small. Making 60/40 queues mean that you allow all of the very small alliance playerbase to play and only a very small + little more horde players ie. now both sides are ghost towns and players are still sitting in an queue that doesn't move. Even if the 80% faction gets bored of the queues and transfers away you are still left with a ghost town.
---
honestly you're probably right, but i'd find it equally likely that blizzard is just not competent / doesn't care enough to handle Classic properly
---
Doesn't it only remove one at a time?
---
Not your friends.
---
Whoo boy you’re just knocking it right out of the park aren’t you?
---
Being able to dispel a fear once every 3 minutes is not "absurdly broken", especially when you compare it to Gnome being able to dispel a root on a 1 minute CD.
---
Similarly, having extra stun resist is only "OP" against....what, Rogues? There aren't a whole lot of stuns ingame.
---
I'm alliance on Herod, so likely very different server dynamics. I did BFD but it took me individually whispering everyone to join my group by just doing /who [class] 23-27 and then asking if they'd wanna run BFD.
---
Also had my friend with me who was druid so only had to find 2 DPS and a tank/healer
---
This is also how I got RFD done
---
this seems really dramatic and untrue.  what 7 guilds transferred off of faerlina?  it still has a 4+hour queue.
---
Horde getting constantly camped on arcanite reaper says sup.
---
iirc it's reduced, so it's better at lvl, but you'll still get rep - until a certain rep lvl. e.g. trash mobs in MC stop giving rep at honored (or revered idk)
---
Do not mess with your spell queue system. It provides no benefit and only will make it harder to chain together attacks. FD + traps work fine for me most of the time you just have to mash, you cant have anything like a dot on you that puts you back into combat either.
---
Oh yea sure. Make us a list of the 16 debuffs you would bring to your raid then. I can't wait to see what's better than corruption to fill the last spot.
---
This addon existed in vanilla
---
I have suggested a meme day pin for people to post away. I will bring this one up again. The problem is a lot of the memes do get through. Primarily overnight during North American times. This is unfortunate because removal is a damned if we do damned if we don't scenario. One we don't enforce the rule and promote other people posting similar rule breaking content. Or we risk pissing off some people. It is a thin line.
---
IF you want to stop playing stop playing, don't keep bothering people who are having fun by posting this

As a multiboxer I have taken sole control of Freewind Post for hours at a time. No flight master, no innkeeper, no civilians.
---
wait so if I don't find this funny, I don't have a sense of humour?
---
Nobody would argue that Nost is better than Classic.  They did, however, get the discussion going within the community and had the meeting with Blizzard which helped get us to where we are today.
---
Thanks. I was worried about that. I guess I'll be back for the Xmas break!
---
I just got to 60 as warrior this week. I have levelled as arms and tanked most dungeons up to scholo fine, so I think it would be fine to tank normal dungeons in offspec. I am thinking about gearing up with dungeons, some PvP and some raiding as well and don't want to respecc regularly. How much damage would I loose if I would try to raid as arms instead? And similarly how bad is PvP if I would switch to fury instead?
---
yes
---
They probably do.
---
Incorrect
---
Gratz mate! The first video was painful to watch.
---
We remove posts that are just "My reaction when X happens!" and then a link to a video of something that isn't Classic-specific. I believe your post follows that pretty closely, but you can use the Mod Mail link to send a request for another mod to review it if you think I made a mistake.
---
That's been a pretty solidly enforced rule for over a year. It's not just a "oh I don't find this funny" and removal.
---
And thus we understand how civilizations crumble and nations fall, all you can control now is what you will be remembered for.
---
For the ony strum enemy quest where you have to go to ubrs for the dragon eyes. Can I get all 20 in a rend run or would need to do full run?
---
only in duels
---
In terms of kindness, humans have the lowest floor, but the highest ceiling.
---
Mabye do some research before you talk about false memories. Even off a quick Google search I can find versions of this addon that were uploaded before WotLK even released and with notes about it being updated for the 3.0 pre patch. It existed from classic mate it just was not very widely used.
---
Well we cant both be having the same experience every day. All I know is that everyone I know on Incendious are complaining about Alliance camping the end game instances. Theres been 1 time I've landed at TP in the last two weeks that it hasnt been an instant death to the alliance campers. Nobody in my guild will even fly to it anymore,we always fly to Kargath since you only die once or twice to rogues camping the pass instead of the 20 minute+ corpse runs into the mountain. Lights hope is hopeless. It's a corpse run every time. Same with DM.
---
Look at the idiot I was replying too. If you still think it's ego, you're a child trying to sit at the adult table.
---
I think the worst part for me is the thought of wanting to start over on a PvE server because I worked so hard getting my character to where she is at the moment. I know that I could have started PvE from the start, but I enjoy the PvP servers -- I always have. P1 wasn't really that bad in comparison -- we would have some pretty epic battles out in the world, but it wasn't overall just ganking/camping save for maybe a couple times where I got corpse camped and it turned into a fun battle afterwards with 2 guilds rallying together to fight.  
---
I have a whopping 1 honorable kill because I logged in the other day and a horde was in IF and I helped gank him - so I haven't even been playing in P2 really because of how cancerous it can be. I would gladly pay to transfer my toons off to a PvE server in a heartbeat.
---
Enh shaman maybe, but ghostwolf easily defeats kite, plus they have frostshock/totems to CC the hunter and get inside their deadzone and kill their pet. Resto shaman maybe, unless they are smart, stay inside deadzone, self-heal and force the hunter to burn his mana kiting then wear them down with frostshock. Ele shaman, heck no. Hunter cannot win. No chance. Their range dps &gt; hunter range dps, + they can heal, have no dead zone, and can drop traps (totems) in combat. As a hunter, if you see an ele shaman, you're f\*\*ked. Period dot. Run away, or get someone to help you.
---
Quit being a bitch and boot them.
---
took me 11 deaths on faerlina just to get to brd......  what a weakling.
---
Does it need to be free for all for that?
---
"Citation needed"
---
You’re 100% right. My idea was to advertise on world/LFG Channel when you’re a couple pulls away from the boss.    Once they get into the instance, you tell
---
Them what to do and then pull and kill the boss and if the legs drop you get paid. Based on the difficulty, drop rate, and time involved you could demand 50-75G, easily.
---
This doesn’t yield 40g per hour when you factor in how often you get resisted. 30 is more accurate. I know from having done it for 10 hours.
---
You’re projecting your fragile ego onto video game developers. This is their job, a job they’ve been hired to do because they’re good at it and it makes their superiors’ money. 
---
It’s strikingly similar to a victim complex, like there is some sort of “deep state” within Activision purposely wanting something that made millions to fail. No one is trying to keep you down, and it’s shockingly immature and telling of a persons emotional maturity to believe in this junk. If you think any of them are emotionally stunted enough to purposefully form some sort of cabal to bring it down then there’s something deeply wrong with the way you look at things. 
---
This is their job, not their life. A video game may be your life, but that doesn’t apply to everyone.
---
As a hunter I learned that around 37 you can solo Dead Mines. Each run if you kill and loot everything can earn about 5g a run.  This is how I earned my extra needed gold for my mount after the honor system came out.  Easy run, decent gold. Good luck!!
---
What fucking ego? The ego of having a fucking job? Working on BFA necessitates humiliation because classic launched and a lot of people like it?
---
Classic wow is fine, but the idea that BfA devs are scheming in shame is fucking insane.
---
I don’t multibox, but I have two accounts.  One for the main and the other for my twinks.  Much easier to do your own run throughs
---
I can't wait for Horde crying when you have nothing to do while we are in BG's. Keep the same energy.
---
Not what I said. At all.
---
If i had said

&gt;people with a sense of humor who can recognize this for what it is - funny
---
Then your reply would make sense
---
But I didnt. Words matter.
---
Learn to read.
---
Everyone back to Rank 1 after their first BG. Sounds good.

Sounds like he might be a strong candidate as a Peter Principle example.

Use the servants trinket and vanish - while they fight loot the book and jump down and restealth
---
I just joined as horde, I can't wait to camp these cry babies
---
I just listened to blizzard. I didn’t fully commit to a server until week 2, spent all of week one watching server populations while everyone was sitting in login ques. Started on Herod, went to stalagg, thunder fury, white mane and settled on sulfuras
---
&gt; The agreed upon way to level now? Dungeons. Get a group and run that dungeon you’ve already run 1000x 15 years ago, and run it another 1000x til you are high enough for the next dungeon and do the same.
---
This only works until you reach around level 50 though. Once you have to go brd it takes an hour to even get all 5 people to the dungeon. 
---
I play on Venoxis which according to ironforge.pro/servers is only mildly imbalanced (41.2 A / 58.8 H) and the areas surrounding the Blackrock are still completely dominated by horde. I can only imagine how much worse it is on an even more unbalanced server.
---
I love the lore of questing and always will go back to it as I level, they also give some great gear for rewards while leveling. 
---
Dungeons are great for both as well.
---
With that said, for gear, I would see what each dungeon has to offer you (I use atlas loot) as well as what quests for the dungeon give useful rewards. If there isn’t any gear to get, then skip it. If it’s a good XP farm like SM, reconsider. If you get tired of farming or feel it’s a waste to run a certain dungeon, you can always look up what zone is best to quest in lvl/reward wise. 
---
I’m current leveling my rogue. Aside from the quest, there isn’t that much gear for me to get out of SM. However, it’s a great way to get XP and money as the runs are fast.
---
Nothing is really ever must do until you hit 50+ for obvious reasons.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Even on private servers with 0 lag this was a complete shitshow. I can’t even imagine what it’s gonna be like in Classic.
---
Isn't it more likely it's a shitty person controlling these and then if the the shitty person isn't doing a good job then someone more competent will take over and correct the situation so that the shitty person can go back to gold farming?
---
I would imagine there's no way so many botters would legitimately get away with it. Way too much anti-cheat software built into the game. I imagine it's just a poor/rudimentary gold farm setup with real people, not automated/bot.
---
It'd do the opposite actually. It would eliminate Raids running around hunting for 1 or 2 people to kill to keep up with the .1% requirement. Which in turn would promote random 1v1 2v1 fights which is actual world pvp.
---
Right now what everyone is doing is farming. Farming isn't PVP. I get you want as big of an advantage as you can have so you never lose, but pretending that's PVP is laughable.
---
this is actually wrong, the dadgamers are on their guild discord(and MAYBE their server discord) and maybe peek on the wow forums during their toilet breaks 
---
it's the "serious" gamers that will come to subreddits and multiple discords involving the game and theory and shit
---
So mages don't counterspell out of duels? Lol
---
Literally the other way around for me on mograine eu. Fucking stupid horde camping brm alliance just afk in IF like some hoes
---
yep thx lol anything i can tell a shadow priest next time? tips
---
You can easily tank dungeons as a pally.
---
&gt; a free bfa when reaching lvl 60
---
So that was a fucking lie
---
Dunno if you're specifically looking for solo druid farming methods. But if you're ok with doing a bit of grouping: 
---
* You can duo farm jump runs(DiM East) with a warrior. 
---
* Duo/tri farm tribute runs(DiM North) with rouge/hunter/druid
---
* Reserve first orb on strath live if you're tanking (or any other way to make gold that warrior tanks have to use to make gold, they got it worse than druids when it comes to solo farm)
---
For solo play:
---
* General low-ish world drops, you can farm pretty effectively, not the aoe madness mages can pull off, but you're still one of the best solo farming classes for 1-3 mobs, elementals for essences, demons for felcloth(with runes as a bonus) and any other world drop you can think off.
---
* You're also one of the few classes that can solo farm mara efficiently.
---
A general tip, of all the gold farming methods out there, you can pull of 95% of them on a druid. You're not the best at any of them, but that's the class identity for classic in a nutshell, jack of all trade, master of none.
---
I would go ret and do quests. A few pts in holy would let you heal if needed in an emergency.
---
You really one get 1 threat spell, and no taunt, so a warriors always going to be a better tank, and a bear druid always has cleave and better ways to keep threat up.
---
Orc, because they looks cool.
---
This is it.  I'm pretty sure my server is more evenly balanced.  There may be more horde on it, but not to the extent of 70/30.  Maybe 55/45 or 60/40.  I'm horde and I've responded to others on my server that play alliance and they believe it's a massive horde problem.  I don't see that on my side.  Yes I see people calling for PVP groups in LFG, but I haven't actually seen any of these horde groups running around.  What I do see is alliance groups.  They may not be huge (anywhere from 3 to 10), but they are camping FPs and inns and camps etc.  I've just hit 52 somehow but since Phase 2 I've achieved 2 levels only.  I'm a prime target and so I am getting farmed on a regular basis daily.  I'm not getting much, if any questing done unless I get in a Dungeon run.  And even then I'm dying multiple times getting there.
---
It's about imbalance, but it's also about the numbers of players on the servers.  It's just not working.  I want to log in, but I just can't be bothered because I know what's going to happen.  I also don't see this changing at all - even with BGs coming out.
---
I dont think i realize how lucky i was getting this pet only after 20 min of camping on a full server at level 41.
---
Kick them, simples.
---
Possibly a debuff such as faerie fire was added? Wouldn’t explain the lack of crits tho. That’d just have to be bad luck.
---
yeah let's pretend that people are usually fighting over escort quests and black lotus 
---
realistically it's a mob spawn or a shitty small thorium vein
---
Show me on the char sheet where the hunter touched you
---
To be fair, the number I pulled from https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;realm=4698_Incendius
---
Which may not be completely accurate. But i can say definitely that it feels like that is accurate to at least one horde player on Incendius, and from what im hearing and seeing with others they agree. 
---
But I think you are correct in just that its population. Incendius is one of the big realms. And if both sides are feeling the same way then its probably not that either one is dominant. 
---
I know one thing for sure. Incendius is not a horde dominant server. At best it is equal and horde side just doesnt pvp. Hell the zepplin between Org ans UC is regularly camped....   Either way im logged for the night, having been killed around 10 times trying to get to scholo from UC. Only one of those deaths are from the epl, the rest were from the alliance camping tirisfal and the bukwark.
---
They tank just fine. Once you hit 45-50, if you're trying to focus on dungeons, staying tank is a good idea. I switched to heals and there is a severe shortage of tanks.
---
you can tank just fine, especially through the early dungeons. just play the class and see how you like it. you don't need to focus on a specific spec until your mid to late 50s if you don't want to. look at some class guides and go and kill stuff.
---
A taunt is super nice to have, though.
---
If this is how you feel then absolutely, classic is the wrong game for you.
---
Retail is so horrible though, why even bother when there are loads of actual good games.
---
I've seen a few tank dungeons and once off tank Mc, seen a few ret pallys as dps but they seem to be less welcome. I don't mind the diversity but more hard core players will say they only for healers. They make great healers. But as tanks it could be tough as they don't get taunt. That's the only downside I know, been a while since I played a paladin, Mained one in tbc but I don't think I got him 60 while in classic.
---
Where'd you get your numbers?
---
Hardooo
---
It sure is. But I’ve run loads of dungeons with prot pallys and they have all gone just fine!
---
Horde no shoes have no honor, nothing surprising here
---
Totemic recall was such a minor QoL skill and it really shows the noob shamans of classic.
---
I’ve seen and warned the shaman in torch room of this exact scenario.  To the point where I’m literally shouting “WiND” and they keep dropping earths and waters.  Yup that wind totem still back there....and we pull.
---
Also see them fuck it up with the room/path leading to Rend.  I have the group rush the balcony to avoid extra trash, shamans always fuck it up.
---
Feign death is absolutely a way to leave combat, similar to like the rogue's vanish ability. A common issue is that if a hunter's pet is still in combat, that counts as the hunter themselves being in combat. As others have noted, a helpful workaround is making sure to put one's pet into passive mode in a macro.
---
i count five people, peak observation skills bud
---
shaman names are pink in classic
---
And also massive servers. Along with min/maxers who realize that Horde have better racials overall for PvP, more people want to play Horde to sweat.
---
But the massive servers is a huge part. If you used to have 1500 Alliance on a server vs now there is about 3.5 - 6.5k on a server, give or take, there's an extra 5,000 people that can go around the world and do whatever.
---
When you don't change resource sizes, resource nodes, or anything else and increase how many people are there, shit gets crazy and fast.
---
In tbc
---
Any guild who still loot councils weapons with how incredibly easy blizz made classic is just doing it to get officers priority
---
Unfortunately this doesn't change their colors to blue. It still shows up as pink and the only way I am aware of that makes them blue is an addon.
---
Nice video. Never seen a troll rogue? Before.
---
Maybe you should think a little and explore more than three zones?
---
Sounds buggy. I misunderstood though - figured it was a hunter who was setting his pet attack to passive to reduce giving you rage, which is smart. Unless he's BM spec, in which case his pet does enough damage to warrant letting it rip into a warrior. If you can't attack their pet but they are flagged I would agree - something is definitely wrong
---
I’m confused when I see this because on the flip side there are already people quitting. So what?
---
Okay so what should I do first.  Stay prot the whole way up?  Or Go ret first and then switch to prot and tank later? Or can I level quickly questiong as prot too?
---
I would have been surprised if they didn't do it.  Really worried it will cause the faction imbalance to increase significantly though.
---
You can also apply this statement to LBRS, and strath (and I think parts of scholo but dont quote me on that)
---
For anyone ootl you can simply latch onto the boat at water level. It's not hard to do at all, you just have to get close to it and you'll travel with it while swimming.
---
1.12 itemization so a lot of items are much stronger than they’re supposed to be. 
---
Cloth turns weren’t added until AQ
---
We had unarmored mounts until 1.4 when they added the new mounts we see today.
---
And rogue. I haven't had a frosty mage best me yet!
---
winters chill stacking up maybe
---
I upgraded my Overpower to Rank 2 and now my Blizzard UI isn't showing the reactive-spell pop up when the enemy dodges. I tried unchecking the box, and also reloading my UI but it won't come up - oddly enough Execute is still appearing. Any clue what's wrong?
---
Probably the most lucritive is relic and pp farming as previously mentioned. But its boring and requires sub spec to be efficient and risk free.
---
I personally prefer herbalism. Swiftthistle, mountain silversage and black lotus have made me wealthy enough for my epic mount. 
---
If your having issues with overfarming, try ghost mushroom runs in mara. Or find a quieter zone like azshara, ungoro or silithus.
---
Alternatively try quiet low level zones for swiftthistle and blackmouth.
---
How can you delete totems at will? Asking for a friend
---
Thanks for the reply! I have added two but I am not sure about this one:
---
&gt;1.12 itemization so a lot of items are much stronger than they’re supposed to be. 
---
Is the current itemization the same that was in 1.12 vanilla? I ask beacuse I've already listed 'starting at patch 1.2' as a change so this would just be a subset of that change
---
To be fair it is PVP one side just doesnt want to be part of it lol.
---
Raid on a day other then Tuesday
---
Don't aoe Hillsbrad then? Horde are so bitchy when they get called out for their shitty tactics. 3 weeks till you all post everyday about queues, I can't wait.
---
Been 60 for 2 months over 30 days play time and still no ubrs or nothing. but at least I found a krol blade :)
---
6? It usually takes me 60 while 3 rogues are following me every death and waiting for me to spawn
---
Pretty sure you just right click the icon, like getting rid of any buff you dont want..
---
I easily get 50-60g an hour doing this depending on how much pots go for on your server, could be more. Just take off your gear or put it in bank and pickpocket naked. No repair bills and if you die its just a 3 min run back same as waiting for vanish if your specced in it.
---
I got my epic mount in a few days of casual farming and not killing myself. I'm rich and have plenty of potions for pvp and guidies, I'm just handing them out I get so much. Blind powder too. Stack will sell for 2g my server.
---
Leveling my alt warrior now effortlessly. Every couple levels I just go buy whatever I want to stay max geared and have no worries of money. Try it, it's the only way for a rogue. Some guy posted the route and they're YouTube videos that go in depth. But yes mindnumbingly boring if you grind it. Just turn on Netflix or something that's what gets me through it.
---
Whelp farming
---
It's like having hunting season year round.  You hunt too much then all of a sudden there's nothing to hunt...big surprise!
---
Because on a pvp server you NEVER know when its going to happen. It most certainly might, but MAYBE it wont. I'll give you an example; theres rogues camping menethil harbor pretty much 247 since the p2 start. So i land and immediately stealth. Find one and kill him. Get on a boat thinking im safe. BOOM ganked by 2 rogues in darkshore. Never happened before. What killed me ? Being content. Had i remained in stealth with catseye goggles i might've killed them and/or escaped
---
Hey bud, I understand you might think this was a neat video and all. But to be blunt with you - it’s quite trash and lame. This is the kind of content I wish to see less of on here. If you want to post videos, put them on YouTube. If you want to advertise your video, make a Twitter. But don’t post it to reddit please.
---
Addon Question, does the right click self cast actually work for anyone using Bartender4? i just un checked the auto self cast setting and realized the right click doesnt work... i hope im just missing something extremely obvious.
---
Small thing but death coil can crit now. It didn’t in vanilla.
---
Thanks, it has been added to the list :)
---
I've encountered this exact behavior 4 separate times over the past 3 days on Benediction. The bots will even continue to cast mend pet as you kill them... All level 60; I wonder and worry that they may be from stolen accounts.
---
Nice
---
i think youre all missing the point. im on a pve server because i actually want to play the game.
---
A major yikes right there , why would anyone but the GM be the bank ? OP better lick this guy's butt now or the bank is gone
---
That's a lot of Ony bags...
---
This post is unacceptable.
---
Yep best answer here for everyone is remove them and let anyone follow them who wants to. Its ur guild. Even if u were only were lvl 33 while the officers lead every single raid. If they want their own guild they can make one
---
Thats a lot of bombs
---
Nice.
---
Ony bags!?
---
Neat.
---
Problem is that you rez where your corpse was. Today a rogue camped me by sapping me the nanosecond I spawned.
---
Only reason I managed to jump out was that there was another poor ally there to take attention.
---
I farm brd with the tanks that need sgc and rogues that need hoj.
---
Find a group that is very fast runs and go with them.
---
Some even let you have all trash blues.
---
But BRD has been some of the best luck I've seen. One of those warlock books drops like every 2nd run for me (never win the roll.) 
---
But I've won edge masters in there as well as uthers strength.
---
The small drops add up as well.
---
Basically I just play the game. It's slow going but every once in awhile I get lucky.
---
Pure grinding gold. Idk. I've though about herb since some herbs are in the water and we get aquatic.
---
But I havent looked into if those herbs are valuable. I'm guessing not.
---
I think the mobs are lvl 42-42 so you might have problems right now but at 39 or 40 when you need that last bit, there is a cave in the middle of stv, the basilisks there drop a lot of great vendor trash and you can skin them, oh and it’s the perfect level mob to drop Staff of Jordan :) 
---
It’s kinda out of the way so people dont check it as much and most people don’t even go into the cave if they are on the quest because they finish it so quick.
---
Looks clean man

---
I'm just surprised the guy tabbed back and ran away to hearth back. You can see the exact "oh shit" moment where he spazzes and realizes the jig is up
---
Rogues are competitive dps until very late raiding, at which point mages and warriors take off. Your choice for battlegrounds may be more important to you. Rogues have more tools to independently control a fight vs a warrior who needs healer support, and the penalty for a hybrid pve/pvp spec isn't as bad as warriors. So depends on your playstyle and situation.
---
You were actually able to mount at the thorium point FP, that's rare lol
---
shill
---
Can you post your macro please?
---
Little bit of everything, but majority of the time dm with herbalism.
---
Not 100% due to the fact that I main a Mage and have only healed small party's with a priest using it but I'm almost certain Luna Unit Frames (LUF) shows anticipated heals.
---
same story yesterday
---
No....just no!
---
That only affects crit chance
---
Sounds to me like it's your guild bro
---
You can still enter through UBRS without attunement, which I would suggest perhaps during the first week or days? The attunment is only to use the orb for teleporting.
---
Still getting to UBRS in itself might gonna be a heck of an accomplishment.
---
Can confirm. I am on Horde and most people seem entirely uninterested in PvP at all, let alone care to get good. You could pretty much do whatever you want and camp wherever you want. As long as you are prepared for the largest response to be 2-3 players you're pretty much good.
---
Nope.. Maybe you should go into BRM literally ever and you will see.
---
Pvp
---
The funny part is I've watched several groups of 5 walk in one by one and get ganked by the same person, when they could have easily rolled them coming in as a group.  A lot of times just coming in together would've saved everyone the wait.
---
You talk like no one on alliance will play bgs asap when they come out , we all know every player will be spamming them , horde and alliance alike , being cross server  ques won't be a problem at all
---
What are you shoulders and robes?
---
You mean BRM?
---
I make lots of gold as a rogue. But all i do is farm. Any class can do what i do. I respec a few times every week and always have consumables.
---
It all depends on the group. I've done full ubrs with only one healer but that requires a beefy tank or two.
---
In general if you're looking at people running UBRS, they aren't raid geared so don't expect too much.   
---
Having proper talents for mitigation makes a real difference when you're not raid optimizing threat gen.
---
I write how ever I fucking want... Also... The horde are fuck wits. Horde mentality is cancerous... Literally. That's why the horde have a huge population advantage. Get desperate for Honor and you will be mistaken that pve realms will make your ques better. They will not
---
This can’t possibly be true, can it? That’s a stupid amount of money to piss away. Why would you need 3 raids worth of toons?
---
This is how vanilla went. People played differently back in the day tho.
---
I hope you kicked him.
---
Which piece of dal rends swords set should I replace with brutality blade? Tauren by the way
---
I do the same, ton of fun. Stealth classes have it good in that regard, really easy to do some wild stuff.
---
This is the only time I play. I wondered why I felt like I had less honor with more work than some others in my guild.
---
Play retail bro. I stopped playing wow and been waiting for classic. Personally i cant stand retail. But to each there own. Play what you enjoy man.
---
agreed, much better to just let those servers die off naturally
---
That's the smart thing to do because then you notice when you're down to one stack.  I always carry more arrows than my quiver can old.  When I hit 2000 arrows, we have a problem.
---
Alliance skeletons
---
When you apologize but don’t actually apologize and instead attempt to justify your buddies shittiness.  Typical boomer.
---
Doesn't matter what class they are, that just sounded like shitty players. Disable your dps meter and look at the threat meter. You go over the tank, you've messed up.
---
If you don't use your single target abilities on the skull that the tank marks, then go ahead, get aggro.  It ain't the tanks responsibility to run over to you(unless it actually is skull that's running away or a boss does a aggro swap, like ramstein's stun in strath ud), you gotta help fix this mess, **drag the mob over to the tank** so he can taunt it off of you (good way to have a tank take notice of you and wanting to group up with you in the future, instead of thinking you're just a bad player not taking notice of threat and panicking once mobs suddenly turn towards you).
---
And if the tank is struggling to keep aggro, just fucking wait 5 sec for him to get a couple of abilities off on the mobs to establish some solid aggro. And use your threat reduction/reset abilities to help out.
---
Nobody cares about your dps when mobs are running all over the place. The tank is in hell trying to get shit under control. The healer is annoyed by the primary threat person who they constantly have to panic heal with inefficient heals to keep alive. The melee is annoyed that they have to run around after mobs. not getting off cleaves and unable to get behind em for their swing. The hunters have to backpedal into weird corners to be able to use their ranged abilities again. Other casters are annoyed as every casts gets interrupted from mobs vanishing behind corners and the mobs moving out of their aoe abilities. Everyone is having a bad time, cause you couldn't look at the threat meter(or just use common logic from what has happened in previous pulls) and control you e-peen to just get a smooth run going.
---
Horde have a noticeable advantage on every single PVP realm, you 100% will have long queues. 30-mins to an hour during peak times, 3-6 hours during normal sleep hours. Ally will have instant queues the entire time.
---
Heartseeker horde making the most of it
---
oh thought it was similar to shadow weaving mb
---
Well, you can reroll alliance on Skeram and see if it's worse for yourself?  Or maybe check to see if it's just one faction comprised of 70-80% of the server stomping on the other faction  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctn-tKXx4Sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctn-tKXx4Sw)
---
Most ppl play with friends so thats hardly a practical option
---
You so noob you didn't even understand why i mentioned searing and peasant collar :)  
---
Exposed for what exactly?  You ally better all go get farmed in bgs cos rest assured world pvp will be even worse for you if queues are that long
---
A company that buys a Discord channel is gonna use it to sell/advertise something. They can't exactly make a new channel called "Buy Classic WoW Gold Now!" and expect anyone to join, so they buy a big channel and use it to funnel business to their site.
---
shut up
---
I’m confused. So you actually want to be on a server with the opposing faction missing?  Because doing nothing is going to make all alliance leave your server. Then what?
---
It isn't even original. There was a post about the exact same advertisement one or two months ago.
---
It did.
---
My friends play retail so I would be going by myself 
---
It seems like theres alot of hate towards alliance lol
---
If I was from the mainland I couldnt even access reddit. American brain.
---
Why 3  priests?
---
WSG is 10v10. AV is 40v40, most people don't play AV after they get exalted...which ally will get much faster. AB isn't out. Horde have a 5%-30% advantage on nearly every reported PVP server. There are not enough Alliance for Horde to fight. Some PVE servers will help, but it won't be enough. The dominate faction alawys had a queue time in vanilla.
---
Female night elf. They arent as big and goofy as Male night elfs. But taller than Male humans. They have some of the smoothest animations and look great in gear.
---
Unfortunately a lot of people who like to erp use them so.... be careful
---
Only kidding, I just prefer horde so I don't know much about alliance :P
---
Brutality mh and drop both dalrends. The easy non raid offhand is Mirahs song. Flurry axe is better than mirahs but costs a lot.
---
From raid the best offhand u can get is core hound tooth.
---
As ur tauren u probably know that u should get edgemasters asap.
---
I would gouge my eyes out if I had to join this chat.
---
If you're horde, you can spend a few hours just outside the town in desolace...at the docks is a repeatable quest for clam meat or some shit, and you loot them right past the dock in cages. They respawn super fast too; each stack of 5 is 55s, so you can make 10g+ an hour doing that.
---
It depends on what your expectations are with the game. If you want to experience the classic game and all it has to offer. Then of course now is as good of a time as any. If you want to be a part of progression raiding then the sooner the better. While you wont be a part of the current content. You dont want to waste any time leveling a toon and finding friends or a guild, and get the gold, gear, and other requirements to be a progression raider.
---
I
---
&gt; It seems like theres alot of hate towards alliance
---
Nah, it's all basically meaningless drama people like to create.  If you go Alliance you'll get to see all the quest lines (and a couple dungeons) from that side. There's a lot of content in the game. It's all worth seeing.
---
As someone who has no plans to play retail, but would also like to get some characters to 120 in case shadowlands is semi decent i might have to try this.
---
Imagine actually reserving bags. Might’ve been cheaper XD
---
True considering they are adding the baserace 5min AV I doubt anyone will want to play that trash.
---
Weird, none of our officers have received a melee weapon yet. I should tell them they're doing it wrong.
---
Purge the heretics, rally the faithful. 
---
Congratulations: y'all just became Sunni and Shia.
---
You will probably have some people leave over this and go with them. As long as it isn't the majority of your raiders it's all good.
---
Good thing im on the horde end
---
2 eyes per dragon mob so unless someone else does it at the same time u should get 20 without a prob on a rend run.
---
Yeah I haven’t been able to get edgemasters yet. Hasn’t been on AH yet. Guess I’ll have to work on getting mirahs
---
Easy to solve.  Put in Queue's for faction specifics to keep numbers equal.  Don't like the queue? Here is a transfer.
---
your trolling reminds me of when i was a teen. One day you will get better at it. For now.... you're trash and you mute people who dont agree with you. Cheers. hope one day you can see rank 4. Im guessing its about the highest you can get hahaahah
---
Hearth, fam
---
It does seem like that's what the person he replied to hinted, though
---
You can tank all 5 mans as a fury/arms warrior so I wouldn’t worry there. We have a couple of our fury warriors respec to arms for the honor grind and their DPS suffered significantly. During 5-mans it’s fine as you have larger mobs and can utilize Sweeping Strike and Mortal Strike effectively. In with Molten Core you don’t have as many large trash groups that effectively use SS and your raid will most likely prohibit you from using MS, as it is a high priority debuff and will knock off a more effective debuff off the boss, so your main damaging move is out the window. I don’t have logs, but looking at meters they dropped from top 5 to 15-20. I’m currently PvPing as fury and while it’s not nearly as fun as arms, you can still delete some players pretty quick with a good string of crits. In the end if your guild is fine with you raiding as arms go for it.
---
On the first bullet I am making the opposite point: compared to the modern standard, Vanilla was a dirty RPG hack, not some magical perfect game.  But how do you get to the modern standard?  You streamline the rough edges out by "fixing something Vanilla wanted to do but failed".
---
You want the TBC mechanics which many people prefer.  I'm more into the wild west Vanilla camp.  The only way to change Vanilla while retaining Vanilla is randomly.
---
During the duel tournament, one of the warriors went 1:1 with a mage.
---
Key is that a warrior with decent gear and cooldowns will 3 shot a mage. So a well timed FAP and interrupts will win it.
---
No.
---
First you get a couple of dps friends (at least 1 lock with shards) and some warrior as "tank"
---
Then you start to search in chat for healers and offtanks saying you can summon
---
When offtanks join you ask in whisper for their gear and offer them the position of MT cause they are better equipped than your "tank"
---
Then you just ask in chat for dps to fill the raid
---
Kind of have similar feelings, although i get it if people spend some gold while leveling. 
---
I found that both the horde characters I made (on a pvp and more populated realm) ended up with way more gold in the early levels than the alliance characters I have made though. Way more green drops and just too much leather absolutely everywhere probably accounted for it.
---
On alliance I haven't had issues either if we are just talking about the level 40 mount, but then I am frugal and I like to grind so I'll often just goto somewhere my character can skin/herb while grinding for a level or two straight and that makes some gold.
---
&gt; So have your breakfast
---
Not for about another 12 hours, but thanks. I will do just that!
---
This may seem kinda dumb but one thing I really dont want to experience is the classic leveling experience i want 60 as soon as possible but I know it will take alot of time which is the only bummer i see
---
The only times I get proximity aggro on them is when I have serpent or viper sting on either one of them and it ticks while one of them is near. So if you're close to king on the ledge and your viper sting ticks on the observer you can get aggro back from it
---
Funny because I tank strat and school with 3 mages constantly doing aoe and we clear it just fine. Does not sound like it was a tank problem /rollseyes
---
That depends on the warriors gear.
---
Warriors scale harder than mages.
---
No blue post as far as I know, so far.
---
Was this fixed last night in the extended maintenance?
---
I think that has more to do with you than it being a pvp server. I don’t EVER think I’m safe. Buffs up constantly. 
---
But even if you do let your guard down.. you just die and walk back to your body. There are no stakes.  You don’t lose honor, you don’t lose items.. there’s literally nothing to be afraid/tense about. 
---
The only “fun” part of pvp, for me, is the competitiveness of trying to win.  Which makes consensual pvp more fun. BG’s, duels, etc. I want to see if I’m better than you. Killing you by surprise lends little satisfaction.
---
Prices will shoot up once BGs are out and honestly, BGs aren't worth using consumables in.
---
Winning/losing just doesn't matter as much as world PvP.
---
I mean he's not wrong, it's multiple views of 5 people sappering a group of 10 when there's videos posted daily of 40 people killing 200 or what not.
---
Blizz devs read the wow subreddits and numerous changes have occurred from popular reddit posts. A lot of your posts regarding WoW are negative i think you should consider stopping making comments regarding the game especially if you are going to be spreading misinformation like this.
---
Ive spit on allies back then on a pve server then I would get hate /w...lol
---
Prefer a druid innervate tank 100% as a priest healer.
---
I love oom'ing during a hard fight, then being saved by full mana brought back by innervate.
---
"Come on"
---
You commoner
---
A lot of the posts here are useless arm-waving and whining. 
---
I think you should stop posting either of those things. That will result in fewer negative replies.
---
is there some way you can remind me when you make the warrior one?!
---
You're right, another pro for rolling on PvE.
---
Night elf.
---
Going invisible would be great
---
#nochanges - server caps are 10k more people than 2004... excuse me what the fuck?
---
its the reddit classic. You have no point because I said so, therefore goodbye good sir!
---

---
&gt; TBC was perfect
---
No it wasn't. It invalidates the progress people made in Classic/Vanilla in hours, if not minutes. Also flying sucks.
---
TBC&gt;TBC+ allows them to make all the same mistakes. Classic+ allows them to utilize the positives of TBC without necessarily needing the negatives (flying) and with room to do more positive things (instead of set the precedent for re-releases).
---
FF wouldn't touch spell damage, would be Curse of Elements.
---
Should've said cant have sex.
---
But then again that prolly doesnt happen a lot to many people here.
---
Omg, people don’t realize. I’m the 58 mage.
---
I ran bfd on a mobile hotspot in the back of a car once. It really was not bad
---
But you can leave the PvP flag on all the time on a PvE server if you want. Plenty of people do.
---
I only pickpocket there are routes where you can kill bosses with a little luck and skill but I don’t feel like it’s worth the headache much easier to just pickpocket loop.
---
That's what happens when you neglect your kids guys
---
I just ignored it and kept leveling. Got my mount at 44, but didn't really have to stress about it.
---
Optimal play maybe not, but optimal for stress reduction.
---
tl;dr ?

I've gotten this buff twice by accident. I just happened to be in Stormwind when  it happened. Does it happen at the same time every day or something? How do people know when to go get it?
---
Macro pickpocket to sap and cheap shot.  Free money off every humanoid you kill.
---
It's awful, something like 1 ppm
---
&gt; although i get it if people spend some gold while leveling
---
I keep telling myself I can do without that one skill upgrade or that slightly better weapon, but I often have a weak moment.
---
Some folks I've seen buy lower level gear off the AH. I think that's pretty terrible if you want a mount. But a few things (like a bow for a hunter when yours is 11 levels below you) can really help move things along.
---
I kind of told myself I'd earn enough for 4 12-slot bags and then save everything.  So far it's mostly working. Blizzard did a good job making it pretty hard to have all the stuff and a mount.
---
Lol you're screwed by level 20.
---
Well i want to stay neutral, because i'm obviously not living on a unbalanced server, also i'm playing on EU FR server, And we do have problems, but its not like being kill at orgrimmar, so i have question 
---
1) How much people it realy need to camp a capital, seems obvious taht many gards are standing everywhere
---
2) Isnt citizen kill make deshonors anyway ?
---
3) How much unbalance are USA servs right now ?
---
It was too big to be called a sword. Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron
---
ah, how many rogues thought similarly... and how many rogues got corpsecamped to tears and ragequitting as a result...
---
protip: if you open on a priest (or warlock), be really fucking sure you can finish what you started, because if you die, they can DoT you the moment you resurrect, then kill you over and over and over again. and it's going to be a lot fun.
---
Press it twice and it'll work.
---
so do you put some oil on the waffle maker, or butter it up a bit, concerned that the eggs dont stick
---
When I did take skinning, I found myself just censoring most leathers anyway. Rather spend on mining or herbs.
---
I have exactly the same experience.
---
On a pvp server for the good memories of cool 1-1, and a bit of world pvp, but what this is now, is unbearable.
---
I’m seriously considering  Rerolling on a PvE server, but I already have 3 other characters behind me, from the que-release-hell, so it’s almost better to give up.

Hey I'm in this screenshot somewhere!
---
It received a big nerf last week. You can no longer pick people up on it before you actually see them.   In fact you see them well before spy picks them up now.
---
NO DONT DO IT. Av comes out in 2 weeks, and the shadow dmg offhand from exalted by itself is better than that staff. Get mindblade or witchblade or inventors focal, and pair that with av offhand
---
Thx
---
Nice. Next big moment is when a big item drops from rag. Then it's all down hill from there lol
---
Easy solution is you re roll on a PvE server
---
That’s why you only post popular items 2h at a time
---
We got 2 talismans this week, and I got the choker and talisman  last week also got cauterizing band but we've never got a eye! Are hunters are stacked tho
---
Link to discord?
---
Just wait until the mage is 20% hp from fighting someone else
---
It was already pretty bad before honor came out, now it's just a meat grinder if you're the underdog faction.
---
Nah, more like screwed at 30 or 35.  Besides, I needed a 3rd alt while my other two (on different servers) for rested xp and came to heartseeker to help the horde.
---
The leveling experience is most of the fame due to only being in p2, you will have to get used to it

300-400 ish

You are the best class for farming Elemental fire in Arathi Highlands.   Longest instant cast spell (moonfire) + swarm. Just stand in the middle of the circle and tag everything with ease.

MODS!! GOT A LIVE ONE FOR YOU
---
Still if you have 99 problems, you got lots of probs
---
go eng. you can have 1 for goblin and 1 for gnomish. Engineering is actually very profitable as well
---
Two questions:
---
1. For any healers using Luna unit frames, do you have issues with incoming heals? I've got it set to display, and it does sometimes, but not others, seemingly randomly. Haven't been able to play with it too much while partied up because I don't want to keep a group waiting on me. 
---
2. For macros, is it possible to dismount and cast all at once? I set up macros that would go something like this: #showtooltip /cast (spell) /dismount But that just makes me dismount, while displaying 'you are mounted' message, and then I have to cast again. Which kind of works, as it's nice to have a dismount key bound, but I was wondering if there's a more seamless way to do it?
---
Rattlegore
---
Fury guide and BiS doesn’t work in Mobile it seems
---
what if some servers had faction changes only going to one faction? for example on Heartseeker what if alliance can faction change for free to horde? not many people would do it but a few will and it will help a little. I wish some of the horde on Faerlina came alliance
---
For me it's I just crafted my archmage robe (decided to give up on getting them myself and just bought most) resulting in me being too broke to properly play the ah I'll need to return to dm soon
---
Addon?
---
Mage: fap and mana burn them and kite. If they have no mana they lose.
---
Rogue - pvp trinket, scatter fd+trap, and move as much as you can, try to kite as best as you can. Keep poison up, hunter's mark so you can see them even if they vanish.
---
Yea, if it was just me making this comment, fine. But it's not. This is becoming a big issue. Read forums or even read this sub.
---
1. Do you mean the normal proc alert in built in, or an addon/wa?
---
2. Have you tried manually placing the new OP on your action bar?
---
3. Are you using a macro that specifies the rank? Like "(rank x)". Warriors can't use downranked abilities afaik, so you would just have to remove that if so.
---
I've never encountered this issue myself, so I'm just guessing.
---
Dont put them all up at once. If you take all of a certain resource off, you need to drop it back into the community not just plaster it on the AH. 
---
If you get undercut, then hold off selling for a few days. 
---
Drip campaigns my dude.  Marketing / sales tactic.  Those emails you get from bestbuy and other companies are drip campaigns.
---
What?
---
only go on a pvp realm if the faction balance is in your favor preferable by a massive margin  
---
When they increased the pop cap they changed the game from classic   to whatever the hell this current shitshow is just roll a PVE server its the closest you will get to an actual classic experience
---
Your new heist coming in theaters ...
---
Yeah.  You only need to use a swiftness to cross the gap with something like noggen for slowfall.  Can mix in parachute cloak and stopwatch/skull of doom for the speed boosts too.
---
Of course. He should have got out his crystal ball when he made his character and predicted the future...... 
---
Why is this sub so adamant it must shoot down every post about this sort of thing? 
---
"Just roll on a different server", "Just raid on a different day". These aren't answers. They are just silly attempts at dismissing people. Why?
---
I will take your advice
---
Nice blog post.
---
Sounds like a bunch of babies
---
I've found that stuff for levels 15-35 make you the most money. Bunch of alts who are pissed off at having to work their main up with some gray weapon and is destined to buy that BOE blue you farmed.
---
The Fury PvE Guide page doesn't have any information on it, just a blank page.
---
It’s not pvp - it’s 5v1 zerging half health players corpse hopping to dungeons.

Dynamic respawns are a thing, it's not going to have a 3-5 minute respawn with 1000+ people in the area.

Warrior is awesome. I'm a returning vanilla DPS who decided to roll warrior for some reason and am currently at 59. Personally I enjoy maintaining threat and take pride in keeping mobs on me as much as possible.
---
If you truly want to tank and don't mind a slower questing experience than other classes, embrace it and enjoy. 
---
If you enjoy having primary responsibility (sorry healers, love you) for your group, roll warrior.
---
If you want to occasionally get out of the blue feedback for your pace and control of dungeons, roll warrior.
---
Mechanically, there is a lot of tab and sundering. 
---
On the flip side, be prepared to be the first to be blamed even if it's not actually your fault.
---
Most importantly, going into dungeons, be honest with your group about how well you know it. If you don't, ask someone who does to handle tags and you will still be fine.
---
I've never once kept a target sheeped for 30 seconds. This is fairy land.
---
I'm based in EU, so can't do census in US. You can even check yourself if you're not playing there, just takes around 20-30 minutes to run a census on each side. Do it on different days and different timeslots for accuracy (the faction balance barely changes according to my numbers).
---
That is 1 bg then have to fly back to queue... not many doing this
---
We just cleared Rag for the third or fourth week as a guild and the Eye of Sulfuron dropped this week in addition to us downing him before submerge.
---
Now we just go for loot from here out.
---
On my pve server, druids are fine for groups, in raids they are either heals or feral dps.
---
Never EVER go a OOMkin.
---
I guess you can follow me on reddit, dunno if that helps
---
Hahah it's not pvp when one side isn't even fighting back. Try another server kiddo
---
I literally just answered it above this post. Not complicated. Sorry you dont like my answer. 
---
And my "whining" is more confusion. But this post has enlightened me.
---
REDDIT IS FOR DISCUSSION. IF YOU WANT MOVIES GO TO YOUTUBE.
---
You've never played Eve Online then.  Lol.
---
&gt;That's not terrible
---
Between 22% and 50% more Horde than Alliance is **not terrible**?
---
That's the spirit..... 
---
Giving feedback in any form is better than just saying nothing and its certainly better than trying to silence anybody who has a problem you aren't personally having. 
---
I'm afraid to say, in general, the attitude of this sub completely fucking sucks.
---
Protect your Horde Brothers at Hillsbrad Farm or Mine.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
IT now scans when you click the mouse buttons instead of autoscanning. Virtually identical, and catches the people just PVPing instead of raiding.
---
Sure. You answered it. After ignoring his answer and then trying to back pedal. You clearly are whining. Blaming others for not doing what you are doing. That's cool bro. Did you ever think that if everyone did what you do NO ONE would make money? No? Of course not because you didn't think this post through.
---
/holup
---
&gt;I've seen a lot of people on this sub praising Blizzard's decision to implement the Honor System in Phase 2 without any Battlegrounds available. After speaking with a lot of people that hold this opinion on the sub, it mostly seems like players that really haven't played Vanilla since way back in 2005/2006 hold this opinion. The game has changed exponentially since then - min/maxing and efficiency are all but perfected on Vanilla servers these days ...   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\[PvPers\] will be camping flightpaths, instance entrances, zone entrances and really any other high traffic area in level 50+ zones - don't forget anyone level 48+ gives a level 60 honor, so this will include zones like Searing Gorge etc ...   
---
Such a frustrating experience will more than likely make a lot of players quit the game, finding it near impossible to do anything in the open world without being constantly hunted down for honor by these players. Just because you enjoy World PvP doesn't mean you want to be camped for 30+ minutes a day by ranking teams.
---
Wat.
---
This is pretty accurate, what he wrote. Maybe he is from the future xD
---
well throwing down totems when you shouldn't is not an easy mistake to make as any other class
---
Yeah I can't really say I played one much in BC so I have no idea on the self killing then haha
---
alliance players tend to be softer.. more weak while horde players are usually must more aggressive and powerful.. dont mean to stereotype anyone,  you probably already know this
---
and on the opposite end you have people who insist on using voice for fucking Razorfen kraul
---
He gets big time parses so he gets a pass from me, his raid leader!  :)
---
Oh you wish that.
---
That’s perf though! Are you feral? 1v1 Bear can beat most warrs and rogues in a fair fight. I like to let them hit the crap out of me without using any abilities, get to 60+ rage then stun and use Frenzied Regeneration to get a lot of HP back, when it’s finished I use Bash ASAP and pop out for an entangling roots and rejuvenate if I have mana, use a mana pot, go back into Bear.   
---
A good hunter can sometimes fight for separation though. It’s fun to hibernate their pet though.
---
I would like to know as well.
---
&gt;IT now scans when you click the mouse buttons instead of autoscanning. Virtually identical, and catches the people just PVPing instead of raiding.
---
What? It catches everyone, it's just doing /who. I'm replying to your other post because you post misinformation there too.
---
As my friend says “Burn that bridge, rip out the stakes, and salt the earth because FUCK YOU that’s why”
---
IIRC /r/tf2 saw a decrease in users after removing their no mme rule since TF2 gets like an update every 2 years and when one of them dropped the sub sas so full of inane shitposting that no discussion could exist about the update to TF2 for nearly a week.
---
Memes are easy to digest and easy to make content that inevitably crowds out all other content if not kept in check. Even /r/2007scape has rules on what kind of memes can be posted.
---
That is not what I meant they are trying to help just can't cause there is nothing they can really do
---
alliance dogs
---
Our raid still hasnt set limits on that stuff, so you have everyone casting corruption.
---
Your (tedious, parroted) response is akin to telling someone complaining about a bad meal, "what? You went into a restaurant and got food didn't you? What did you expect?".
---
I expected a good meal. Not a shit one. 
---
People expected good PvP, not shit PvP. How is this such a difficult concept for you idiots to comprehend when you are typing out the exact same dumb fuck response for the millionth time?
---
This
---
Mograin is nicely balanced
---
Which equals that. Either horde or alliance can use the world anymore
---
&gt;Census addon is no longer considered to have been accurate at all.
---
By whom?
---
&gt; is considered trash since it reads most servers as more balanced now that layering is removed, making it more accurate.
---
By whom and HOW? That makes no sense. If it's doing a /who, it's just counting the people online on both sides on that particular moment. If you do it on both sides, you'll have a quite good estimate on the faction balance at that particular moment. Do it on a Wednesday or Thursday evening (EU, move it one day earlier for US) and you have a very accurate sample of the faction balance.
---
People like me would make money cause we arent stupid. Just like in real life there's tons of ways to make real money. Apply the principles to the game, boom, you make money.
---
Thank you for handling the response on this one. He pretty clearly didn't even take a cursory glance at the numbers. Horde have some gnarly queues to look forward to.
---
BG spits you out where you queued.
---
I always SS myself for tactical threat drop during Onyxia.
---
The ratio isn't the problem. The overall population of the servers is the problem. Try again with your silly little rant. 
---
Fuck me this sub is full of idiots.
---
I'm EU-based, so I don't know. I always hear about Heartseeker being the big one for Alliance side (PVP).
---
No it was not luckily! Was the one handed axe
---
Biggest questions which will determine the answers. 
---
Alliance or horde
---
Pve or pvp
---
What's the point of a guild rivalry if there's literally nothing you can do with it?
---
A good strategy for anyone  who struggles with this phase as a tank or guild:
---
Have your off tank stay about 10th on the threat meter. For Druids that usually means Mauling every other attack or two during phase 1. Then when she lands in phase 3 you’re either top of the meter or very close to it.
---
Alliance pvp
---
F
---
TIL 58 is a lowbie.
---
...no, I know that. Dynamic respawns ARE in Classic, devs confirmed this and I experienced them myself. Even named quest mobs were respawning faster with lots of players around.
---
yeah, but they're all gathered in the most popular horde city on one of the most populated PvP servers. with that level ofbplayer density, of course there is horrifying lag.
---
sounds like that mage needs to go somewhere else for a bit lmaoo 
---
but your post is probably gonna be removed for rule #7 /:   RIP
---
Again technically its player vs player.
---
You cant say that something isnt what it is because it isnt fair or fun.
---
Interesting. I still suppose they're not worth farming without some form of AoE?
---
For leveling, sure. At max there’s a fair amount of dungeons with bosses and trash drop aggro entirely. They definitely lack there.
---
my guild just got our 10th leaf.
---
so dumb
---
I think the word your looking for is an introvert.
---
We're to the point where people are downvoting a post saying "things should work".
---
That's the level we're at.
---
Cringe
---
You have the commands backwards, /dismount first then /cast spell. The macro is going to execute Actions in order, if it doesn’t apply then it goes to next action.
---
Out of 3 mc runs weve gotten 3 gutgore rippers and a corehound tooth. Also an entire set of nightslayer. Odds are crazy yo.
---
I dont have a narrow view, but I dont let the game mechanics cause me to cry. 
---
It's cool bro, I'll be decked out in the best gear, surrounded by half naked night elf girls while you cry in a corner cause ya poor.
---
Ayyy I know this video. You are the hero we need and deserve.
---
Hey pot. Did you think I'm stupid? Why? Because I can actually understand what he said and you can't? Or is it because you think you are smart because you can play a virtual auction house to make virtual currency. Or is it because you just got called out. Hmmm.. I still don't see a reason from you why I am stupid. Maybe you should explain it to me. Or maybe you should go look at the original comment again
---
Same
---
A server can 'feel' alive and well with 1k players. Which why they were capped at 2.5k/3k back in vanilla as opposed the mega server clusterfucks they have now.
---
Is the tinfoil hat you are wearing craftable or is it a drop?
---
"warlocks are mushrooms"
---
And for horde-edgmaster, can you explain how rivenspike can give higher dps than perdi? The speed for WW should not be that big of a deal
---
One of our tanks Bloodraged while running into the Ice Block pull on Garr, he got there first and was promptly bitch smacked
---
Did you even read the post, lol.
---
&gt; No person with a normal life can achieve that, and no level of IQ, skill, or common sense can lessen that grind. It's literally only achievable by "losers."
---
If you just see like in asmongolds stream or on all the other streams how many people who play this game are super wasted antisocial spergs, every normal human being would say they are totally crazy and would need to seek help.
---
Its unbelievable what a human waste this game attracts.
---
Just saw the XQC video and like so many this guy totally lives in a different dimension... and while seeing all those guys and I can only say you are right this game is for losers, or people who have nothing in their RL so the only thing they can do is play the game and be proud about their rank 14.
---
Just by reading the posts here so many people can only argue "YOU PROBABLY SUCK AT THE GAME" "YOU GOT OWNED" and its super sad to see that all they can say is "but but look how good i am at the game and you are not!"...
---
People have 500+ days playtime on their wow accounts, so much of their life wasted for nothing.
---
You're saying that we Allies on Mograine actually hold stuff for more than 5 minutes? If I happen to land at LHC when some 10 allies hold it, I see a message in the chat 5 minutes later that they need backup because they're being slaughtered by 20 Hordes.
---
Thank you! The hero we don't deserve
---
It most certainly does not feel balanced as an ALLY try to get to BRM.... like at all. It's gotten progressively worse. LOOKIN AT YOU OURO(SP?)
---
You're right a lot of people did see it, but they were certainly in the minority.
---
See that is where you are wrong. You are whining that people can not make money for their mounts. But then you fail to grasp basic economics. If you have a bunch of idiots like yourself selling then you have no buyers. With no buyers you won't have any money. With no money you'll have no half naked naked or even clothes girls surrounding you. Ontop of that who said I was poor? You are jumping to conclusions and thinking you are Superior to someone who as I have said previously called you out for being ignorant. Try again narrow minded fool
---
Haha yeah I’m the ud priest. I was hoping to meet an honorable target but when I saw your level I decided to salute a fellow nightly grinder :) cheers!
---
Didn’t you know you can splitfare a flight?
---
It’s a new feature on the Ubergryph app.
---
Alliance legit can’t play the game on PvP servers. Pretty egregious mistake from blizzard honestly.
---
Lhc is al Ost 24/7 camped by 30 alliance
---
Just like the entirety of plague lands is not usable for hordes just like felwood tanaris and feralas
---
Just to name a few
---
So yes
---
Oh I see! I think I had it that way because I wasn't sure how it'd work when already unmounted. Much appreciated!

I'm not attacking virtuousness. Are you capable of honesty? It's a virtue.

You didn't even respec for it? Big kudos my man

Shit man I'm not sure. Threat Plates i think it's called, but it's highly configured.
---
That's when you use your PvP trinket to get rid of the root.
---
Hrm.  This was an issue in vanilla as well but the honor would be added next day.  If this isn't the case in classic then I'm glad I haven't tried to rank up since that's usually the tim I play.
---
&gt; I don't play classic
---
Why are you here?
---
Imtercept
---
Blizzard have said nothing about cross realm BG'S. So i would assume there will be only realm bgs like it was in vanilla.
---
Reddit loves to say this about LC

Precisely why capitalism works and socialism/communism do not.

How can I make details stop sharing my talents?

Warriors are gear dependent. Get a good weapon
---
Why do people think bg will cut down on ganking? Serious question. I'm of the opinion that gankers gon' gank.
---
Mankrik ? Had a good wpvp yesterday in Hillsbrad.
---
Got plenty of the ring but never seen the legs 😂🤞🏻
---
&gt; Something tells me you're hunter type #2.
---
Ever heard of devil's advocate? You are making the same mistake that OP did. Labeling is way worse than spoiling someone's game. 
---
Besides, my opinion, it's uneven justice. After OP got his pet, he easily can go on with his game, while the previous hunter possibly can't do the same. Don't you think it's too harsh, considering that the 1) situation was created by the game design? 2) you don't know the story except OP's 3) you've been manipulated by OP's emotional video.
---
Combuctor. Its dope go get it
---
Nice gold you got there.
---
Rp pve server here. The playerbase indeed is alot more relaxed here when it comes to tryharding. Theres still 2 guilds who go for speedruns, farm azu nd stuff, but most is chill raidguilds! Druids are fine, some guilds use druid maintank and i know a few boomkins aswell.
---
Other reference is PvP, i was 10th on the server by pvp-ing 1 evening in the week.
---
Don't believe this person. Balance, when properly geared (lots of green "arcane wrath" gear" and with partial to full consumables, is a fine addition to any raid composition. Your mages and warlocks will thank you.
---
The biggest knock is the simple fact that their primary spell Starfire is one if the least Mana efficient direct damage spells in the game.
---
You won't be using moonfire or insect swarm, and wrath is simply outclassed by Starfire raw dps output. So properly grated balance druids will down rank Starfire to try to end every fight with as close to 0 Mana as possible. With Mana potions, innervate (when allowed to cast on self), and dark/demonic runes, a balance druid can be a perfectly viable roster spot in a raid.
---
Besides, look at the average boss kill times in warcraftlogs. The fights are really really short now. Going oom in a 1.5 minute fight isn't really a good meme anymore.
---
Plus, BOOMkins have the BiS dance emote. Enough said.
---
Fucking peasants can’t do anything right! *adjusts monocle*
---
Warriors is the weakest leveling class of them all. Preferably you should kill stuff thats 2 lvls lower than you. Killing stuff at equal or higher level punishes a warrior hard compared to other classes.
---
Best way is to make sure you always look for a good weapon. It helps you enormously
---
How to kill mobs is to keep battle shout up, spam sunder armor with ur rage and swing.
---
&gt; take another prediction from someone who predicted most of this
---
Worlds smartest man, predicted what already happened. Now imagine playing wow the first time around, than you won't think you thought of all the ideas in 2019.
---
normally i would say don't show peoples names on reddits etc because anything that's just fun spirited, or a little annoying escalates into horrible things.
---
However, this guy deserves whatever the fuck he gets what an actual man child
---
Lyceum?
---
Because it’s unoriginal and low effort. Make an original meme or high quality gif/video and I’m ok with that but an overused meme with text overlay shouldn’t be allowed
---
&gt; So you (and those Alliance players) don't know how the addon works
---
I knew that it repeatedly use /who to gather unique players while deleting duplicates, but not exactly how it scanned.
---
And would combining warcraftlogs and census provide a more accurate frame by catching raid loggers who have a narrower window to be seen by census?
---
30ish  Gold is fine at your Level. Income will accelerate till 40
---
Unless he means total players, I'm which case ALL bg's are 20 or more total player cap
---
You're not born with a pepe avatar.
---
I see  what you did there;)
---
Good piece of advice. There was a priest MCing me so often and made me jump off the balcony, killing me so many times... I didn't know what to do.
---
Is this based on private servers or classic?
---
Your counter argument is actually really poor as people complaining directly to blizzard often goes unnoticed. Most changes dont happen unless social media is filled with people talking about it.
---
username checks out
---
this reddit thread must be purged
---
We must be on different Ashbringers... I'm Horde on Ash... And every night is a 45 minute corpse run to BRM.... You guys love to pvp 1v25... Questing I'm not even going to talk about.. Once I saw a searing gorge Horde pvp raid form, and all ally just magically vanished after a few fights..
---
I go back and forth between retail and classic, pve v pvp depending on server que. I don’t have time to wait an hour to get in just to not be able to play due to grinding spots being camped. I was really hoping the classic community would be like it was in Vanilla, but the server populations are too big and only two people I played with in vanilla are still left in classic. There were about a dozen opening day. 
---
I’m really disappointed that the care bear vibe among our faction that was present in August has turned into anger and bitterness. 
---
Retail- no one talks to each other, but at least they don’t spam world calling people names 23/6. 
---
I know a lot of people are still having fun, at least according to reddit, but everyone in the game just seems miserable.
---
Wow...thank you I’m gonna do this
---
No thanks I'm fine with it as it is. Go back to r/teenagers with the dumb "meme templates".
---
I don't think using dota as an example for anything is very good except how to make a game kill itself from how bad it's community is
---
Then you weren't doing enough damage xD
---
He probably bought them with gold DKP runs.
---
I'm afraid that neither of your claims are accurate. [Blizzard announced](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23090136/world-of-warcraft-classic-faq-what-you-need-to-know)  that BGs would be cross-realm before Classic launched (foolishly IMO) and BGs did become cross-realm at the end of Vanilla. [See Patch 1.12](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0).
---
You can use both in short succession in clutch fights but also mortar is a much bigger explosion radius so you can easily land a 3 second stun on 5 people
---
[Inventorian](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/inventorian).
---
After the zoning, autoressing and dieing simply run from the spirit healer and ress near the ship. What's the problem?
---
Regardless of order, I don't think this is possible as dismount seems to trigger the global cooldown.
---
What I use currently is Leatrix to autodismount on an action which can't be done mounted and then just spam the skill.
---
Windfury
---
I see, there isnt a lot of +nature damage gear so I understand. Seems blizzard did not do druids a favor when designing their balance spells.
---
That's unfortunate. I haven't seen anything like that. Come to rattlegore, my guild will gladly have you.
---
wat
---
I can't find shit!
---
yes, I've been using a two handed axe... but i havent found a new one in a long time
---
That's why I suggest running the census on the most popular raiding times/day, to catch as many raid loggers as possible. I had Ironforge.pro open at the same time as I was running the census on different servers, to compare data. The problem with that website, and with warcraftlogs, is that the census is dependent on the players: they need to log the raids. 
---
In the end, the trends are pretty clear. Horde dominates PVP servers (all of them in EU, most of them in US), Alliance dominates the PVE ones. In both cases, by no small margin. The trend seen in retail (with time, faction balance in a server gets worse, not better) will be witnessed here. By the time the AQ war effort is ongoing, most servers will be one-faction servers.
---
Lmaoo
---
Level the Orc and ditch the undead one. Orcs are better for both pvp and pve.
---
holy shit, i've been spamming those moves because i assumed they were good
---
I can’t believe you’ve done this
---
Not much blizzard can actually do unless they force entire guilds on horde heavy servers to transfer to heartseeker. Maybe by giving them all one free epic of their choice they might lol.
---
See reddit. While I do not have it this bad, I get ganked by Alliance all the fucking time.
---
You guys are just as bad as we are. The side with the bigger numbers will always do this shit, just because they can
---
And that was his last rodeo
---
Mi... Ministers?
---
Cap all honor to your most productive 3 hour stretch from each day.

As a priest, all I can really do is spam dispel, shield and the un-stun trinket.
---
How amazing is *Smoking Heart of the Mountain* for bear tanks? Is it really worth dropping Skinning or Herb to work towards only to drop Ench again?
---
You mean make him get to 48 faster )
---
Windfury mate. The slower the main hand the better
---
For 1 I believe others need to have an addon with incoming heal functionality too for the addons to work. So thats why you just see some.
---
Ye, let's make a generic qq post for the 100th time and expect sympathy. Suck it up buttercup
---
Yah, I am not looking forward to continue leveling my priest...
---
I still beat warriors ez without fear. As sl I just have heaps of virtual health, and like 2/4k of that will deny you rage.
---
The thing is, it isnt just "the major faction" it is other human beings. Say we or Blizzard do the best we can to level load across every PvP server and distribute the Horde players. If populations are really what people are saying here, you still end up with every PvP server being Horde dominated. Now you have Horde players forced to change servers but even AFTER doing so, they are still fucked with que times because less people wanted to play Alliance on PvP servers. So even if we do the above, every horde on my server logging on for Tuesday night raid after work, get to roll the dice on whether it takes 30 minutes or 2 hours to log in and if they get to raid or not.
---
Blizzard fucked up and if they want to fix it, they need to properly incentivize people with benefits rather than punishments.
---
Example 1. If you are from the primary faction on a PvP server and transfer to a less population messed up server, you get a free epic mount or shiny doodad of your choice for one character on the account that is moved to the new server. Hell just set a gold amount and say everyone that transfers gets 800gold in their bank, on the new server.
---
Now for you, is something like this acceptable to help spread out the population, even though we still aren't going to get 50/50 servers? From the other comments in this post, I know a lot of people are going to disagree with this and say "Horde shouldnt be fucking paid to server transfer" even though it is to reach the end goal they are claiming they want.
---
Thoughts?
---
Grats for the pet!
---
PS: Jelly af for that BRE+T1 Shoulders
---
People like you can just enjoy the free honor while it's available, while the other 35% of us are going to keep complaining, because it's a bullshit experience. I don't want to spend $15 a month to get murdered 17 times on my way to the grocery store.

---
what do you all think about this as a druid build for flag running? I am trying to keep the feral charge, the omen of clarity, nature's swiftness  and then rely on feral instinct and thick hide and natural shapeshifter. My armor is currently almost 13k.
---
Omen of clarity has been essential in dueling and world pvp, but perhaps it is time to set it aside? My goal is ultimately survivability and speed in warsong gulch. I also wouldn't mind being able to raid as either resto or as an offtank.
---
Op post is twofold: first part is just what it is currently, don't like it go do something else, the retail game lost its soul by complaining and looks like it'll be again. I'm playing a prot warrior so I'm on the receiving end as well. And the second part about some party that failed, well, thats due to said party. What you want, dungeon finder?
---
And sadly, it's not even because of rule 7.
---
Could you even farm if you're not a mage? Judging by the videos, if you pull one of the dancing crew, everyone else will follow.
---
Just my personal experience but 1-3 man gave me best honor so far. Highest daily honor for me is 24k, average being around 16-17k. After 6 pm the opposing faction groups get bigger so soloing is more risky.
---
I mean... it’s the internet so there will be toxicity in the comment sections from time to time just like you find it here. I don’t agree that dota subreddit is worse than classic wow in that regards. I sincerely think the mods do a good job over there to balance and keep things within reason. In the end you can’t please everyone and there will always be idiots commenting.
---
Subjectivity in how different subreddits are perceived aside: one thing I do get from dota subreddit almost anytime I browse is a good mix of memes/shitposts to serious posts discussing matchmaking, balance and anything related to the game to more personal stories. 
---
I agree with OP that this subreddit has become
---
more like retail that is more grandma on Facebook with skybox pics and drawings. They have there place of course but the most serious post I have seen this week (front page) was the person who got scammed when getting lionheart crafted. It’s a shame.
---
sorry but you posting your orc warrior getting dalrends just shows you're a noobie
---
Ubrs is easy.
---
There are only more Horde on pvp servers so if you are on pve and que together with other pve servers then you might still have to wait.
---
Both those are legal in alot of states
---
Wow your in-depth analysis is much appreciated :)
---
Your stupidity is astounding.
---
Stonespine is hell. Can't do play outside of instances and getting to high level instances takes more than 10 deaths.
---
Truestrike + devilsaur + battlechaser is 126 AP, 2.65% crit, 4% hit
---
BDS + flameguard is 176 AP, 3% crit and 1% hit.
---
So, you are saying 50 AP and 0.35% crit &gt; 3% hit at yellow cap?
---
I didn't mention you nor pvp. However, you saw that as an personal insult, and you are saying this subs attitude sucks? :D gl hf peanutbrain

The internet dont radicalize people, but people on the internet does.

I watch a lot of cartoons as well, love stories so dont care if they're animated or live action. But MLP is made for little girls thats something everyone can agree on
---
It's like going to a pizza place and being upset that they only serve pizza with other patrons feces in it.
---
Not so hard.
---
It should drop in a raid and all world first guilds will  be going bwl via ubrs anyways so they do not need the attunement as its only for using the orb.
---
This is actualy ridiculuos that  Bliz does not do anything on the problem.
---
Go to a warrior trainer. You buy skills and abilities from them.
---
No they wont.
---
We never stopped raiding mc when we were in naxx, and multiple permanent bis items drop there as well as thunderfury and sulfuras.
---
Okay, based on your posts, here's my advice:
---
1. You are extremely weapon dependent, like rogues, so find a good weapon OR if you're desperate, buy something level appropriate in the AH (level appropriate and cheap). OTHERWISE, take mining and blacksmithing and start making stuff until you get to make weapons around your level range.
---
2. You CAN do instances like ragefire chasm, but I'm not aware of any good 2-handed weapons in there. Perhaps Thrall's quest will give you one, but otherwise I'm not strictly sure. Doing dungeons is a good money making exercise.
---
3. Don't use heroic strike. I know, it's like the first skill you learn and it deals additional damage, just don't use it. It costs rage AND it'll replace your ordinary swing WITHOUT generating rage. Instead use sunder armor (if you have it), spam that until you have 5 stacks. It'll make killing mobs easier AND your normal blows will still generate rage. Thunderclap is useless, don't waste your time with it, BUT, do use rend.
---
4. Perhaps you know this, perhaps you don't, but the same trainer that taught you your first skills will provide you higher ranks of the same skills as you level up. ONLY buy the ones you'll use (like sunder armor), but skip the ones you won't.
---
5. Use battle shout to increase your damage, and demoralizing roar to reduce enemy damage.
---
6. 2-handed weapons, stick to that. Sword and shield are useless until much higher levels.
---
7. Better armor means more survivability. If you get blacksmithing and stay on top of raising that profession, you should be able to keep yourself decently geared up to a point.
---
8. When you hit 20, you'll get cleave. Remember this rule (which also applies to heroic strike): Attacks that replace your next attack DON'T generate rage, which means it'll COST you rage and take away your ability to use your other abilities until you've generated it again. ONLY use these abilities if you're overflowing with rage.
---
That's what I've experienced with improved Power Word: Fortitude. The increased stamina does apply to other players correctly and shows in the character stats but they see the default value on their mouse over of the buff and not the improved one.
---
Did he really make an alt on the opposite faction just to tell you this cuz you emoted on him? :D :D I don't know how that guy survives on the internet if THIS triggered him :D
---
Warrior has no reliable defensives, no general CC, extremely minimal stuns, and are so dependent on their enemy letting them generate rage it's laughable.
---
As a result, they're extraordinarily terrible in 1v1s and classes like frost mage and shadow priest dumpster them so hard that warriors basically need that 10~15 level advantage to be on even remotely equal footing with them.
---
However a warrior with a shaman or paladin pocket healer is utterly terrifying
---
Like he says, ppl remember the pvp from vanilla. Backpaddling warlocks who dont fight back until they are 10% hp.
---
World pvp now isnt as it were in vanilla.
---
NOT MY FIRST RODEO
---
BC was good. I do not share the fond memories of wotlk many seem to though, that expansion destroyed my enjoyment of the game.
---
It is best in Slot and an extra 500 bear armor or so but if you don't mind not being a peak min/maxing youll be fine as it, overall, won't make a very significant difference, and there are tons of fun trinkets you could use instead
---
You have to keep aggro or the taming channel breaks.
---
Even then still only locks and priests benefit.
---
I recommend 1 29 21 for pve/PvP/flagcarrier.
---
Nature's grasp, bear talents and nature's swiftness.
---
No idea why its stalled. It should been released with honor system, only reason it didnt in vanilla was because they werent finished.
---
As ar as I know its based purely on the level of the mob and the level of those in the group near the kill. Has nothing to do with damage to the mob. If it did, healers would get shafted on dungeon xp.
---
Are all your skills still rank 1?
---
OP also posted this somewhere else:
---
&gt;Imagine my server is 80% horde and 20 ally.
---
[link](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1kqj4/factionbased_queue_call_for_action/f8s227k/). What a surprise uh.
---
Witchblade and orb would be just about the same dps as the staff
---
Yes but only the healing portion is bugged.
---
[Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1kqj4/factionbased_queue_call_for_action/f8s227k/). What a surprise uh.
---
u can kill plugger and the Tauren Pyro Boss. pretty easily (Tauren boss depending on your gear though, plugger is a free kill)
---
It's the honor system, not the fun factor.
---
I don't know that paladin but as a 60 holy paladin with 5 cleared mc's and still only rocking hammer of grace I hate that guy. Got cautorizing band though.
---
Its common in german to call an alt a „twink“.
---
I have no idea why though, its been like this since in started playing vanilla 15 years ago.
---
def not a free kill, usually a warlock will beat me 1v1 but it will be a very very long fight unless i manage to global them in a hoj 
---
when i get my glimmering mithril insignia i don't think i'll ever lose to one again tbh
---
Look for the classic wow Warrior discord. Should be loaded with tons of resources like ability rotations, gear, how to spec, etc
---
FYI you can just use a lesser invis pot to skip all the ogre trash. Then you're just dealing with the non elite insects in the north east corner. After that it's just the single dog pack and the boss.
---
I don't think it has to do with the damage but solely with the level differences. After all healer still receive XP in dungeons.
---
Yes. Feral is armor dependant and leather doesn't have many good high armor options. Having a trinket with armor is basically free 1k armor in bearform.
---
Oooh, i feel that warriors pain.
---
My mage is 60 and my druid is 41, and I've been considering making him a 49 moonkin twink or a big bear flag runner. But would I have a better time playing druid in WSG at 60? Mage is my main and druid will probably remain a very fun alt.
---
I just sit at the entrance to Hearthglen and dispel the disguise buff.
---
Which less than 0.1% of priests have.
---
Server lag has been fixed because the mass amount of people not playing anymore since P2 dropped.
---
Omen of clarity is nice but I'd say NS is better for clutch heals etc.
---
Now I have your reddit account, Salt Miner.
---
Lot of people forsaw this, basically anyone who did a private server launch..
---
But blizzard have been too stupid to listen anyone but the #nochange mob. 
---
They can only blame themself for the damage in faction balance done by this, and the loss of sub that happened.
---
Hopefully BG queue will be managable for the hord but i doubt it : too much ally already quit and the ganking squad will continue even after bg launch. It will be slighty better, but don't hope to do anything than corpse to go to brm anytime soon, or most likely ever.
---
We land at red ridge as a raid, then run in as a group, going solo is asking to be killed ATM. Summoning has to
---
Yep. It's very good experience. Boring as hell though and will require a lot of trips to the vendor/bank/AH unless you and your friend have very good bags.
---
&gt; edit this was before I knew you could desummon them. Isn't as easy as right clicking a buff.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
If u got DB as a human i 100% recommend getting edgemasters
---
gkick
---
Molten is in &lt;Atlas&gt; last time I looked after failing to make I think &lt;Loyalty&gt; a thing.
---
People wanted vanilla / legacy experience. What they got was Private server one.
---
Check spec in end of the video 👍
---
what warrior?
---
The spell only heals, a different spriest debuff is what boosts the damage.
---
OK BOOMER
---
Do you know the definition of rampant?
---
The scores are literally invisible right now though
---
When exactly does honor flush aka pvp rank update happen? Which time (by server time)?
---
no.
---
Eh good point. Roll for names lol
---
nothing was fixed lol
---
Fury tanking shouldn't be too hard since the warrior should easily out-aggro the healer.
---
I feel like ashbringer is reasonably acceptable. Alliance aren't dominant, but the balance is enough that organized pvp groups fight back and control areas.
---
Typically for example alliance will control BRM with a 15 man group, while horde will control Searing Gorge/Burning steppes.
---
As a hunter, definitely CSC.  It's best until the leaf!
---
Theres a macro to desummon all totems quickly.
---
Warrior DPS, the blaster is a great statstick.
---
It's really confusing when you advertise for fixing the game and the community lashes out at you or downvotes your posts
---
Alliance have the upper hand on Zandalar?! First I’ve heard of it.
---
Maybe its because A) you complain about yourself getting downvotes. If thats not a solid way to generate downvotes I don't know what is
---
and B) you have a comment history of you simply bashing Classic nonstop while also sucking the dick of private servers even if they're of lesser quality?
---
Blaster is a warrior tank/dps stat stick because of how mediocre it is for hunters.
---
even our medium server lags ...
---
Imagine being this tryhard and competetive on a 15 year old game btw
---
It‘s not even being competetive it‘s plain being a piece of shit.
---
said hi a lot followed by a dead rogue
---
My guild uses warcraft logs to determine who has the highest ticking DOT damage and who might be tossing the wrong debuffs on bosses.
---
remember in orgrimmar there are 2 faction turn ins. on for the orcs and one for the trollfaction. the troll guy is sitting with the mage trainers
---
It's pretty close to being equivalent to focal sword + aquamentis. Quality wise, it's basically just a pre-raid bis item. Nothing like edgemasters.
---
I'd throw some feelers out in world chat and see what kind of reaction you get. I'd be surprised if you couldn't sell it for 30g or more, but I don't think you'd get over 100g. But then again, sometimes prices go nutty just because things are epic.
---
But don't AH it, because that kind of item isn't something people are going to easily be finding when looking. A purple link in trade/world chat though will draw some attention.
---
Pretty sure it's cringy to most people who don't lurk exclusively in gamer bars and their home
---
imagine playing a game and complaining about playing it.  This isn't the only game in town
---
Jesus.
---
pvp trinkets don't remove stuns tho
---
Hmmm., don't think I've encountered this before but sounds sick
---
I just need CSI miami horatio now putting away his glasses and my life is complete!
---
Reddit is just an echo chamber and right now it seems to think faction based queues is the solution even though it'll piss off the majority of players due to its nature of affecting the higher population groups of each server probably leading to people just flat out quitting. I'd unsub even though itd be unlikely to affect me due to my extremely late play times outside of weekends.
---
I'm pretty sure they won't fix this, sadly
---
blizz support allready sucked but for classic they really don't give a flying fuck

"Anyone want to heal a quick 5 BRD arenas?"
---
Why god. Why do you punish them so. Those poor warriors.
---
That's excessive though. You can finish the whole of MC with around 6-8 stacks max. And your bag should hold 16-18 depending on which bag you're using.
---
Why carry so many?
---
Ashbringer is pretty chill imo
---
Druids are the best class for battlegrounds IMO. You are the main tank in WSG and AV (unless there happens to be a Prot Warrior in your AV match - rare but happens sometimes). In AB, you're best as a stealthy base attacker + healer. Very versatile, very fun, and very useful overall.
---
Balance (without Moonkin Form) is nice for 1v1 and open world PvP, but it's weak compared to Feral at running flags and tanking bosses in AV. Running flags and tanking bosses is what wins games, not 1v1 kills. Some variation of the [30/21](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505012130302215-05502310131) build will let you swap between tank, healer, and flag runner depending on the battleground.
---
At level 49 you have less talent points. You would want to stick to one talent tree, which means less hybrid powers than a 60 Druid. No AV either, which means tanking isn't important. [This build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003--055013105315021) would probably be your best bet for a 49 Druid.
---
Best to combine with 2 of: herb, mining, ench.
---
DE items worth more as enchant mats.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames (SUF)
---
Yeah this entire subreddit seems populated by retail players who have never played the game or played for a few months back in high school. Anything minorly upsetting is immediately removed
---
Everything is sunshine and roses, meanwhile there's no actual discussion of the game going on which is a pillar of the vanilla community: actually caring about the game.
---
This rule seems mirror to Blizzard's "trolling" rule on the forums. Basically giving them a free pass to delete anything for literally reason.
---
To me, someone defending the server lag that happens during mass WPVP would be considered trolling.
---
Factions are mostly balanced on Firemaw (55% Horde, 45% Alliance) and in my experience the Alliance are much more co-ordinated on our server. Alliance had total control of multiple questing zones like EPL and Un'Goro for almost the entirety of last weekend, no horde groups were co-ordinated enough to group up and come and contest.
---
Totally agree.
---
There are always players AFK and new blood (or vanilla players) coming in, if new players jump more 
---
 on the Alliance side than the Horde, the gap will be balanced out over time.
---
It might get tough for a short time for the dominating side, but good for a long run.
---
And what actually matter is "if Blizzard really wants populations to be balanced". They can do plenty of things to make it up right now, and some time later to see the effect maybe in a year, maybe 2 years.  But if they don't, all unbalanced realms will become unstoppable one side. It's just matter of time.
---
it's brutal.
---
Yeah its like 55-45 and the hirde alreadt whining
---
Yeah i still would love a gladiator chain xD
---
introverts != retards
---
Get a real grown-up job then.
---
yes.  kekw
---
&gt; My point is just that faction queuing doesn't solve the actual issue
---
It nudges it in the right direction. The issue right now is that tiny imbalances compound themselves into big imbalances which compound themselves into massive imbalances. The idea is to create a system that self-balances so that imbalances disappear instead of compounding.
---
If a server was imbalanced towards horde and they received queue times maybe the average player might not transfer but *some* people would and some new players would decide to play on a server or faction with no queue times. This is only a small nudge but it's a nudge towards Alliance being slightly better than they were, and that will subtly improve their chances in PvP. That small improvement would itself make Alliance just that little bit more enticing which again improves their standing. It's a slow cycle towards balance.
---
Faction queues are not designed to solve the issue instantly but no instant solution exists. They're designed to slowly move the game towards balance and then keep it there.
---
Sorry for bad england.
---
My interest in doing that kind of died after the 70th or 80th run for my friend and pvp popped up. Doing the runs fine, wading through the warzone of BRD to do them... yeaaaaaaaaah. 
---
Fairly balanced server, BRM is the friggin' Vietnamese jungle if the ferns were corpses and the trees were also corpses.
---
I think battlegrounds are really fun and AV is definitely my favorite! Partially because pre mades can't join AV, I think, which makes things more fair, unless I'm wrong about that. But anyway, thanks for all the tips! Maybe I'll try 49 twink for a while and if I feel like it I'll just get him to 60 for some real BG tanking and stealthing.
---
I love mage the most overall but the class has three major downsides
---
1: lots of drinking !
---
2: super squishy
---
3: frostbolt, frostbolt, Frostbolt
---
So druid is perfect for switching it up. Thanks for tips.
---
bs its 60/40
---
"Fury...no longer have a rage bar or any form of resource generation whatsoever."
---
you wouldn't want that
---
Dont talk about stuff you know nothing about. Its not extremely difficult. And saying tanking and healing on 2 diffrent accounts is nothing??? You dont know how multiboxing works so why are u "teaching" people about it.
---
I play Warrior, Priest, mage, mage, mage without a single issue. Educate urself before u educate others
---
Yeah this is what always gets to me about the militant No Changes crowd. The game has changed already because we have. We know everything about the game, nothing is a surprise, everyone is prepared. World PvP without battlegrounds was always going to be like this, and it sucks for anyone who hasn’t already gotten 100% organised
---
Everything I'm seeing suggests this is using parts of the bfa client that wasn't removed for classic. If it gets widespread like Spy, I would expect Blizzard to kill it.
---
That server you joined 20 days ago is paying dividends. Those mods must be smart dudes...
---
Fuckin hell. Just finished this quest today after trying and failing to solo it at different times over the course of several days. Fuck that warlock and his Felhound gobbling up my buff. Fuck the dual rogues who patrol Hearthglen in stealth. Fuck the 5 man who camps the tower and kills Isilden so that Taelan can’t die. Fuck that quest in general.
---
I forget the hell pvp servers are. I've only ever rolled on a  pve.
---
You can't blame private server players for whats going on.. Pserver players probably make up less than 10% of the classic population.

This is how it is for alliance players on way more server, Enjoy the suffering for choosing the easy pvp crutch racials faction.

Easily, 200% drop rate on the eyes - you should have it way before even entering the arena
---
Yeah, but you referred to it as "so called advantage" implying you either don't  think it's an advantage or don't think horde have more players.
---
I'll tell you the same thing your horde are telling Ally for complaining about being camped everywhere on Azeroth. Suck it up, this is classic. If you don't like queue times you don't like real pvp. ect ect.

not sure if brave or stunning

Tge only “good hunter gear” worth mentioning is devilsaur gloves/legs and you can craft it for free in your guild or for 5g elsewhere. Take engineering instead

To answer your question no it isn't fun. But this is the cancer Blizzard created and you have the pleasure of  experiencing

Not sure how you're planning on doing this when you can enter ubrs with 10 people max. You'd have to run 4 different groups and leave/join just before ebtering the portal or something? Beats not getting in i guess

Wtf are your warriors doing, it's so good for pvp.
---
Killing people doing escort quests is the ultimate assholery, but...
---
I was skilling up mining in Ungoro few days ago and came across a pair of an undead warlock and a tauren druid just coming of the cave in the north, escorting the gorilla. Not feeling particularly spiteful, I let them be and went into the cave to check for any thorium veins. I made it few steps in and what do I see? Corpse of a NE warrior lying on the floor. Maybe they died while questing and logged off there, but let me check.
---
   me: /w warrior where you killed by horde?
---
   warrior: yes, a warlock and a druid
---
   *one minute later*
---
   me: guess who just failed their escort quest?
---
The griefing (or as you put it "PvP") isn't going to stop with the release of BGs though, I would bet quite a lot of money on it.
---
You know when playing a shooter and you shot one bullet of a magazine of 30? Better reload.
---
That's why.
---
*Nice*
---
There are BAG SLOTS IN THE BANK?!
---
This changes everything.
---
My mind is honestly blown right now.

It's not true, my chest was literary 5-10min delay between EVER SINGLE message. For the majority of the day. I have never experienced anything this bad before
---
Been trying to get the ring from Wrymthalak in LBRS since week 1... my buddy got it on his first run a couple days ago... damn you Azeroth, I’ll see you tomorrow.
---
There's 100% bots out there that work
---
Looking for group is a blizzard run channel. World chat is something no one owns except whoever gets owner by default
---
I myself am a manager and can guaranty: we do not do jokes.
---
What about Bonescrapper dagger from Baron in strat. All guides seems to forget about this one. However when I calculate my dps its always goes on top over Mirah or Dalrend as long as I use sharpening stone (+dmg not crit one).
---
Even on paper seems like a good wep. 30AP and it synergizes very well with dense sharpening stone due to its speed.
---
Ofc only nonhuman/orcs as you need Edgemasters for it.
---
It's almost as if those people with Private Server experience knew exactly how it'd pan out as they've seen it happen multiple times before... yet nobody believed them
---
The crying emoji gives it a lot of realism. 10/10

Oh is it you, skitzyoone to skitzotwenty :D ? do you stream it?
---
Rogues are all gankers. I let all allies go except rogues because the fact they play rogue tells you they plan to be a cheap shotting asshole
---
The brief moment of almost Vanilla WPvP was the day of release when almost every lvl 60 was in Southshore.
---
Of course, even that wasn't the same as it was just an AOE lagfest...
---
Id rather have 500 Hordes roaming for Honor than 5000. 
---
At 500 its "Avoid those 2 zones today"
---
At 5000 its "Dont step outside Ironforge"
---
Razorgore is pretty nice, about 45 -55 A/H balance (a lot more horde 60s though)
---
Only the map part.
---
You should Google for warrior weapon progression, if you have trouble finding a good weapon for very long
---
Get your own group of gankers and do the same. Crying won't help you.
---
300g tops
---
If I had a penny for every time my group wipes because the group hangs back while I, the tank, ask them to stick together in the Lyceum then my subscription would be covered indefinitely.
---
One time I even witnessed them all split up looking for the keepers...
---
Nah, Alliance cant do anything wrong, and the Horde are cunts. Thats what I've learned from this sub so far.
---
Same. I was leveling my alt earlier in hillsbrad and man there were a TON of alliance just slaughtering us. I also have noticed almost every day at peak hours they like to group up right outside of UC and just nuke everyone that comes near. I know that Bigglesworth is most certainly horde dominate but it seems to me the alliance side is very healthy with the population they have.
---
No one is denying you the opportunity to play BGs. It's just a numbers thing. 100 horde and 50 alliance queue up for a bg, 50 of those horde have to wait. 
---
Either quit or reroll.
---
Again I never said anything about shaman/rogue matchup.  Other than saying I think it is pointless to discuss class strength on this platform as it is too subjective ofc.  This hasn't changed since my last time posting that.  
---
I will say that vids like rogcraft where a very skilled Rog player is cherry picking encounters and editing successful ones together into one vid is a completely biased source to base anything on.  You have to see this right?   If you were stating 1v1 stats or a pro duel tourney as your source it may have some weight.  This series really doesn't.
---
There are plenty of places in the world, where a great sham player cld make a vid insta deleting chars at range with chain light into earthshock.  Would this vid make shamms the op class? No.  More skilled, also no.  Too many factors and one biased vid won't change that.
---
You are offering no factual evidence to support you claim, throwing insults and flaming others who don't share you opinion.  Coming across pretty salty tbh
---
&gt;What about orc with edgemasters?
---
Flameguard gauntlets/devilsaur gauntlets/gargoyle slashers.
---
Amen brother
---
there are plenty of bracket 1 people who are already playing 18hr days
---
I see some people have mentioned Ashbringer, I'm Alliance on Ashbringer and I recommend this server, very healthy population and decent faction balance. BRM can be a bit chaotic at times but alliance usually gets a group together to reclaim it when horde is dominating. I don't think you need to worry about this since when you're at that level BGs will be released (unless you plan to powerlevel) and things will most likely have calmed down! :)
---
If you're interested in pugging, we have a guild that is running a pug-concept, raid leaders host raids several times a week for all content, hit me up!
---
&gt; If the balance is 80/20, and they put queues so it's 60/40, they are putting HALF of the people on the server in a queue (all horde). I would hate to be put in that unnecessary queue. Server full is a fairly understandable and forgivable reason for a queue, but to do it willfully is not something I'd be happy about, and you'd be relegating half the server to that... making it likely a longer wait period than the launch queue. 
---
I don't think people corpse running 15 times from flight path to instance are very happy either?! Actually I'm pretty sure they hate to be put in that situation.
---
At this point being able to login doesn't equal quality play time. 
---
So faction queue's + free transfer for the realm popular faction would in fact be a no brainer solution.
---
this was stalagg at the same time in stormwind [https://i.imgur.com/jHlAV5z.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jHlAV5z.jpg)
---
In practice it would be shit because it would severely hurt server populatuon. Getting the horde down to 20% ally population is wiping off 3/4 server pop. Thatd be insane
---
I rolled a 100 on an Onyxia bag a few weeks ago, and rolled a 99 on another one last night but lost to another 100. Crazy.
---
Well yeah I'm not talking about his shoes
---
Now you're just changing your argument as you go whilst accusing me of not following. You've gone from private server players setting the meta to blizzard increasing server pops being the issue.
---
Yeah Luna and Healcomm are really good. Also, you may want to look into having one Druid go Moonglow-Regrowth spec and the other being rejuv-swiftmend spec. Having both in a raid makes it so the druids don’t compete for HOTs and they should both be able to put out pretty solid healing numbers. Also make sure you’re utilizing downranked HT in both of those specs.  But I mean, at the end of the day just make sure FF is on all mobs and your job will be done.
---
Blizzard, pls let me transfer to Heartseeker until I finished grinding my Wintersaber &amp; timbermaw and farmed \~50-100 arcane crystals, then Ill transfer back.
---
Ignore the shield and 1h advice here, OP
---
erm
---
I'm on one of those Ally dominated servers. It's not as bad as in the video, but it takes about 10 - 15 corpseruns form me to get to MC...  
---
Last week we teamed up with 2 other guilds to run to MC together. Even so a lot of people that were picked off by the alliance had to corpserun 5 - 7 times...
---
can feel your pain, especially about Leafs ...
---
about Blood though, 3 is pretty accurate tbh, Overall its just super rare, but due to the amount of People and the Little use it has, its cheap af in ah (at least on Razorgore EU)
---
Good help is soooo difficult to find.
---
This is beautifully written!
---
I like how you get downvoted on this sub for telling the truth because it doesn't fit their narrative lol.
---
Its pretty bad, staff from dm tribute that hunters are selling is better
---
you do have the "no honor buff" when force rezzed.
---
I'm pretty sure its a Legion-esque macro that shouldn't be working in Classic.
---
Surprised it's still in if that's the case, since it's a pretty huge change to shamans being able to just remove their totems without summoning a new
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Noob question here:
---
Is QS in the Mainhand better than Mass of McGowan? 
---
I raided as tank for the majority of classic and need to go fury now.. 
---
It's hard to give up QS for some blue but I think it needs to be done.
---
If you play Horde on Mograine enjoy afking for 2 hours before the Alliance raid groups stop camping your body
---
Rule 7... new is always better?
---
thats wrong thread title. it should be "our server is so ded look"
---
Hes not really trying to get into the mountain though, he keeps mounting down to attack some single horde players, which are almost always obvious traps, just terrible judgement.
---
You get to modern standard by changing the core philosophy like wanting to make things faster instead of longer: adding flying mounts to speed up travel, speed up leveling, speed up instances by making them shorter and TP people into them, etc... or by removing options instead of adding options.
---
You don't get to modern standard by making MC a bit harder or adding "Ulduar" difficulty, you don't get to modern standard if you make Shaman a good 5man tank, the game isn't streamlined if you add plans to blacksmithing, the game won't be like retail if you don't get honor for killing a random lvl48.
---
My point is that it's not a fatality and many people, like you, seems to think that changes = retail when changes can make the game even more oldschool and Vanilla easily if that's the purpose. 
---
And if you are in the "wild west Vanilla" camp, just ask you what would have been the wildest: that suddenly people discover a new craft recipe that add fun things into the game? that classes are re-balanced and suddenly people can't follow guide but have to find new build and which object that are the best? that 5min after dying Ragnaros would rise from the ash while screaming "YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THAT EASY". if they added faction specific 4th talent tree for each class to make faction feels a lot more different? Those would have make the game even more wild.
---
Ah how silly of me, thank you for this discussion consisting of you telling me to leave if I disagree with you. 
---
And let’s not pretend that 100 threads complaining about faction imbalance full of the same people bitching about how “this isn’t pvp” and others regurgitating “pvp happened on a pvp server, reroll pve” constitutes a discussion.
---
Found the botter.
---
Meh, I dont care. I cant play that much, and its just 2 more slots. Also it benefits the guild, since the gold goes towards consums and repair bots.
---
I have 2 accounts alone, one is just for scouting alliances so my horde guild can snipe them :)
---
none of us even died to horde, I'm just complaining about the lag. Summoning people would've taken an hour considering it took 5 minutes just for a portal click to work.
---
Isn't in funny how the guild that zergs will also post here for sympathy reddit points?
---
Why is it whenever I get another quest item or kill another quest mob wow starts automatically tracking that quest despite me untracking it every time? I don't like the additional interface noise
---
Applying buffs generates threat. There's a gimmick with paladin tanks spamming greater blessing to generate more threat than their regular attacks would.
---
Well, the trinket Glimmering Mithril Insigna combined with a PvP trinket (to break the Death Coil --&gt; Fear combo) and some minor Shadow Resistance and no Warlock is going to bother you again.
---
It’s also BiS for horde 2H fury. I only need that and QSR and I’m done with MC
---
How do you get the colours and classes to match up?
---
exactly, the users that cry the most are usually solo players that will run into groups of any size and then come over here to cry about imbalance, when in reality their faction is doing just the same on oposing zones
---
If it makes you feel any better, when I got my broken tooth there was a lv60 orc hunter taming him and probably a second away from being done. I dismounted and got a viper sting on him at max range, canceling his tame. Proceeded to kill him 1v1 and tamed Broken Tooth for myself. I felt bad for him... but it had to be done. Having your own faction do this to you though is kinda messed up.
---
I don’t understand why only low effort memes are not allowed. ALL memes should be banned!  They’re all low effort!
---
I used to think I was too old to understand the appeal of memes, then I realized it has nothing to do with age.  It’s just that I’m not a fucking dipshit who made it past McDonald’s fry cook level of intellect 20 years ago.
---
How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way.
---
Sorry but you need to abandon your character and move to another server.
---
Warrior skills rank up automatically on your bars. Most likely no gear
---
But not in most countries.
---
Literally the only truth!!!
---
&gt; You’re delusional if you think there isn’t at the very least a slow trickle from every enabled free transfer. 
---
Yes, thank you Captain Obvious. If this was only the thing you want to say with your previous comment then I have nothing further to respond, nor would I have responded to it in the first place either since it's a stupid comment. 
---
However, I assumed your comment hinted towards that horde will also transfer to the server and balance it out once again to make it (almost) perfectly balanced as earlier, to which you are not a strong, reliable source to since you can in no way know that will happen.
---
In my experience Tanks are the easiest role to find for Ony. Only a few folk to roll against for helm for Warriors and Feral Druids can use like three of the drops really well.
---
If it's a duel you actual have a chance against a druid, because his space to kite around is limited and you can cut him off. But yeah, if i see a druid in open world i nope the fuck outta there.
---
Only if you buy them.
---
There's a guide out by someone else, but I don't think it's worth the effort.. I've got my arcanist gloves and I could recommend doing regular runs or getting Frostweave Gloves instead ;&gt;
---
No one cares.
---
RFC quests get you Axe of Ogrimmar. This starts from thrall
---
Thats ironic, since pservers made so many changes over time and intentionally made content harder to more closely resemble the average players actual vanilla experiences compared to how the game is played when everything is known and everyone runs with optimized specs and gear.
---
Blizzard used to create games that were heavily inspired by other games, always copying and improving upon the best parts of other games. Now they took inspiration from pirated, modded versions of their own game and only copied the worse parts of them.
---
I'm 52, and I get farmed by all the 60's whenever I try to level outside a dungeon. It's not an experience I'd pay for, hence the sub is cancelled.
---
People SHOULD be able to be named and shamed for their terrible actions.
---
it's crazy to me how many of those people you're talking about there are. as a complete newb who hit 60 and was on my way goldwise/gearwise before the bloodbath i'm having an awesome time with the world pvp and gold farming. hit rank 5 and got like 300+ gold doing it with herbalism/the odd farm here and there for soul shards
---
i think if you're pvp inclined you're fine if you're a rogue, lock or mage. because you can walk around solo and still do some damage (in the case of rogues, stupid dumb damage and honor), i can definitely see the other classes struggling for consistent fun when you can't always jump on and kill shit.
---
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN You got BLASTED!
---
You're clearly not on an ally dominated server.
---
Sorry came out wrong. I meant it shows the map no part in square but I noticed things that get put into the minimap like nodes etc still use the circle outline.
---
What are we looking at?
---
Passive regen is not counted as resource gains.
---
Imo it's not the memes that should be left in, rather the said scenery/dinging/whatever pics should be deleted, or have a stickied "screenshots" thread where everyone can post their skybox.
---
low effort troll
---
go back and play your fucked up retail bizarro wow where everything is shit and people socialize even less
---
You don't like it, we get it, now the obligatory : "gO pLaY rEtAil"
---
I let a Gnome be with the Jaedenar escort.
---
I leave those emo barrows and meet a troll mage. He tells me he was ganked by a Gnome warlock. I find the warlock again, still escorting, and I whisper the mage asking for the name. With the name confirmed, the Gnome gets shadowbolted in the face.
---
I hate the idea of ganking people escorting, but if you're a jerk be prepared to fail it.
---
Oh, he was near the end. I regret not letting him spawn the elite and spam fearing him. Perhaps I just wanted a clean execution.
---
I've never seen a mage outDPS-ing me in single target up to two enemies. AoE-wise... Well xD
---
cross faction collusion is only against ToS on pvp servers
---
Cdl?
---
And I am Alliance so it is needed every second I am alive
---
Looks like we got one of those tanks here .
---
I come here basically just to sit on my high horse!
---
Oof forgetting to use aspect of the monkey, and not logging out at the lil mountain!
---
Regardless gratz on the tame
---
i'm well aware. i plan on eventually dropping skinning if i can ever get the pristine hide to drop. once i drop that, ill pick up enchanting for smoking heart, then drop that and pick up mining or herbing
---
Viper doesnt cause any threat. 
---
Wierd things that I have found DO cause aggro though are switching to Aspect of the Hawk, and proccing Imp Asp. of the Hawk.  Both apparently cause a small amount of aggro.  Wierdly, switching to Cheetah doesnt do the same.
---
That's the problem with DKP systems: people pass on good upgrades because they're saving their points for even bigger upgrades.
---
g o T o R ET a IL
---
BS, not true at all for Warlock.  It's just like the first guy said.  Sure you can play SM/Ruin and if you're the one lucky lock in the raid that gets to cast corruption, that's great and it's kind of a true.  You still suck at farming but you could manage something.  If not you're speccing from DS/Ruin for raid, to SM/Ruin or SL/something for pvp, to SM/DS for farming.  This is assuming you want to be optimal at the stuff you're doing rather than playing a shit spec for it.        
---
As it stands you can do one or two of those things comfortably, but for the third you are either not going to be optimal for it or you're going to be respeccing weekly.      
---
You also have the option of saving yourself money and sucking at pvp or sacrificing your raid dps.  But if you don't care about that then fine.  It's just for people who want to be good at the thing they're doing it sucks.
---
Based upon your post history I'm just going to call it here. Your attitude clearly shines through in what you write and I have no interest in partaking in that experience. Enjoy :)
---
You know, it's pretty obvious that even you yourself know that you've proven to be in the wrong when you're only response is "u mad bro?" 
---
Especially ironic when you're making butthurt 5 paragraph replies in defense of a multi billion dollar company, all because you failed to find one single comment of what you claimed you saw "a lot"
---
*mic drop* ♥
---
You're terrible. Fact.
---
Hunters FD and drink when soloing DM Trib.  It doesn't cause threat. Consumable use is a diffrerent issue and not what the OP was referrring to.
---
Got my epic mount doing the same. Pick will flowers and killing the goblin. On my server it was about 40-50 gold/h
---
Are you considered in combat at that point? FD is very weird.
---
Cast it when healing is NEEDED. Otherwise it's just unnecessary threat caused.
---
Alt I’m pretty stands for your “alternate” character.  A twink is definitely an alt, but not all alts are twinks exactly as you stated. Kind like how now all wraps are burritos but all burritos are wraps
---
On a server like Skeram to get anywhere near normal you need literally over half the total horde population(more like 2/3) to transfer off.  Unless you get some Alliance to come here so not as many Horde need to leave you are basically making it into a low/medium pop server.  Also have the issue of where are you going to send the horde refuges?  Other than heartseeker there just isn't really a pvp server that can accept a bunch of Horde.  So that means you end up shuffling those horde into PvE servers instead?  It just sucks there are no good solutions at this point.
---
Was pretty obvious that you are salty af
---
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE #nochanges
---
Those who’ve played both Alliance and Horde to max or close in Classic, what’s your honest preference? 
---
I’ve got a level 30 of both factions now and I’m deciding what I want to go with. I haven’t got a specific objective in mind, I’d just like perspective on further down the track (eg. story, zones, dungeons, what the people are like, questing, cities, race aesthetic).
---
Also to add concerning PVP - 1hander is preferred for PVP, because you can alter on-use offhands like Spellstone, Ancient grimoaire (skelly book from Ony), Skull of Impending Doom.
---
It's supposed to be the same as raid resets but it seems to take some time.
---
Same here. rolled on an rp pve server and its very relaxed.
---
Ban the Facebook posts
---
The Carapace Spine Crossbow is superior because it's slow enough that you're not clipping your DPS rotation. The base increase in white damage DPS you see on Blastershot Launcher is undermined by your yellow damage rotation clipping an autoshot off.
---
The only ranged weapon Hunters should be taking from MC is the Leaf. The other ranged weapon drops are sub-par and should go to melee DPS as stat sticks.
---
I have a warlock as my main so luckily I didn’t worry about a mount. But I was trying to hit that 100g mark anyway. 
---
I was in my high 30’s right around the week pre-phase 2. So I got lucky farming mats for free action potions and regen potions. 
---
I spent a lot of time selling swiftthistle, oily black mouths and stranglekelp. I had 90g when I hit level 40. 
---
The prices have come down a lot on those mats so I do have to find something else, but there’s always something in the AH that is a hot commodity. 
---
Selling raw mats is deceptively profitable.
---
Irrelevant
---
Cost me under 150g all told, including the mats for the Heart itself.  I did do some (I could count them on one hand) solo runs of lower level instances to save some cash.  Vision dust especially had pretty volatile pricing on my server; it could be going from 5s per to 25s per depending on when I looked.  
---
Well worth it for an item that has no parallel for bear tanks.
---
I play on Herod and it’s defined an alive server/community. But it is one of the more populated server and has been having hour+ Q times since the reduction to 1 layer. With that’s said I know people who have transferred off and say they regret it because the new servers can be somewhat stagnant as far as the community goes.
---
Get a dps set?
---
Yeah it really looks so dead. I can't even see Org with all of the people in the way
---
You can play, you just have to wait. And i'm certain alliance would transfer off if they were given a free transfer, like we're proposing horde would get.
---
Druids are great at 39 because nobody has mounts yet, but at 49 it's not that special anymore. Warriors really shine at that level.
---
Most guards are a joke.  I remember 5-man Horde groups just killing the flight masters in certain towns without any issues whatsoever.
---
And yet the Horde get Goblin Super Soldiers to protect their zeppelins.
---
10k on one server? Jesus christ. No wonder capitals are seas of people these days.
---
Getting 60 would be the best thing you can do to improve your chances.
---
Regarding spec: since you are leveling I would recommend just going for affliction, its good for leveling and good for PvP too. 
---
Regarding gear: you should stack as much stamina as possible for PvP. You can get spelldmg if the item also has stamina, but going for pure dmg items is not good (for small scale world PvP). The difference between shadow dmg and spelldmg is that shadow dmg obv only increases shadow spells, but as affliction most of your dmg is from dots, so thats no problem. On the same item level you can get more shadow dmg than normal spell dmg, since it "costs" less.
---
Yes. But there's a twist. There'll be a faction change too, it's blizzard after all. It'll be glorious "if you can't beat them, join them"
---
FD takes you out of combat but as soon as you start drinking it removes you from FD and you re-enter combat.
---
You spent atleast a full minute typing that out to defend yourself on reddit. Obv you do hehe ily
---
I use the vexing cane currently. Thought about switching to a Mh and offhand but honestly the 2H stave is better stats than anything I’ve found so far. 
---
If I have to use my sword or stave for combat as a warlock then something went terribly wrong.
---
It's a really bad suggestion and thankfully because it's so bad it will never be considered.
---
In my personal opinion, I could most definitely be wrong, but I really enjoy sm ruin and I top dps meters(I’m also sitting on 404 spell power, which isn’t the best but it’s decent. It also makes me a glass cannon) in dungeons and raids and it also allows some decent PvP action.
---
You should be a tailor and have crafted the entire shadow weave set as well
---
Farm zf gy, get the cane.
---
Basically run shadow weave til you can get fel cloth gear.
---
Get to school and get necropile for pvp.
---
There is a fix. It's called PVE server.
---
I don’t even know how many US servers there actually are, so I don’t have a solution for you. I know there are one or two that are Alliance dominated, and the rest I’ve seen are around 55-60/45-40 horde or greater.
---
The last update I read stated that Blizzard is offering free, faction based transfers to help alleviate some of the imbalance. However, it’s up to players to take those transfers, and it’s apparently not happening. At least not on a noticeable scale. Any way you look at it, the servers are going to be imbalanced.
---
Yeah like the guy above me said, I use Prat
---
They won't get the same kick in battlegrounds but maybe they'll be drawn in by the more efficient honor farming?
---
Yeah I would rather do BG without honor (no try hard) than current honor with no BG. The whole point of pvp is to have honor right now and it’s not great to improve, the opposite would have been amazing to learn pvp
---
Did you make this?
---
Take on fishing and netflix / fish farm in Azshara. You can also heal strat live instead of UBRS and hope for orbs. Aim for favorable loot rules. I run a shared sell rule on orbs with guildies. 1 person takes all the orbs, sells on AH, splits gold with the party.
---
You forgot a party that camps BRD entrance.
---
Wow a full minute
---
We have 2 shamans both with leaf and sinew.... And we have many priests without benediction...

Took me 2 months on my druid to get staff of dom...
---
Kick them before they can get more people to join them.
---
Don't even need a different spec. I always start with 2 Blizzard into FS -&gt; AE spam with coc thrown in. If mobs resist first frostnova i just start with FS -&gt; AE spam instead. It's easily doable with 6k mana. I'm too cheap to respecc until BWL, so everything is done with my pvp/aoe spec. Saves lots of gold in the long run.
---
I’m more amazed that people use /lfg on your server, everything goes through /world on mine..
---
Lies. This guy is a hunter in my pugs.
---
I don't know how you can say with a straight face that faction queues won't solve the problem unless you narrowly define the problem. When populations are balanced, players on both sides can actually do things in the world. They have a chance to fight back. What's happening now is the minority faction, even on 60:40 splits, sit in their capital cities all day. They have almost no realistic access to any important zones. Faction queues absolutely make the game MUCH more playable for minority factions.
---
Anyone with a brain already knew this, which isn’t saying much for this sub.
---
The position to place yourself should directly correlate to the number of fireballs you get in P2.  
---
The higher your dps is in P2, the fewer Fireballs you will get, the higher the secondary tank can be.
---
We saw only leafs since the start of wow. Sometimes you are just unlucky.
---
Someone do the math?
---
What are the odds of this happening?
---
Found it on popular but I use to play wow. Started during BC so I have a idea of why flying would kill one of the aspects that attracts people to the old azeroth.
---
It will come back and bite them in the ass when BG's are released. The imbalanced servers will become even more imbalanced, and then they will be gifted with hours long queues for WSG and AB.
---
Shadow -&gt; BWL
---
WTF did you warn me, I started reading Reddit after all this crap was introduced. 80% of the players just wanted to play the game and not read forums to start preparing for min/max bullshit.
---
There's more people on medium pop servers now than there ever were on full servers then, so it can't have been the same. You're just dead wrong, not sure what else to say
---
Thanks man
---
I'd take that bet.
---
Doesn't restorative potion share cd with free action potion?
---
That wasn't my experience in vanilla, I never played before BGs, but when I played pvp was mainly people already in an area competing for quests or resources and people helping them if things got out of hand. None of this farming people like theyre npcs bullshit.
---
Iceblock.
---
Im happy to hear you lost all that honor :)
---
Pretty sure it isn't. You keep on thinking that though.
---
Go to a warrior trainer asap. Your spells rank up
---
I'm having the same problem with my shaman. Besides switching speccs or professions you really dont have that many options. I would try running DM E jump runs with a warrior maybe. I dont know how profitable that is tho.
---
I decided to lvl a seperate farm character, because ,as you said, straightforward farming is just terrible as a resto, even in dps gear.
---
I think people forgot that the reality of world PvP is putting up with bullshit 99% of the time, so you can have that great spontaneous PvP moment you selectively remembered only 1% of the time.
---
I'll leave a link to another post about different weapon set ups for fury warrs depending on race. Its clear from it that CHT is indeed really good for certain weapon setups that fury warr might use.

How often do these events take place? I figure this is worth knowing in case I ever do for some reason feel an interest in trying Retail.
---
IIRC it caps at 10g for the other 5
---
Can somebody explain what this means? I cant visualize whats going on by the title. Somebody is camping a FP. Ok got that.

THen they are using Mind Control. Got that.

But its during a duel to remove an honorless target? I cant visualize what that means? Dueling somebody when they first get down from a FP?
---
Can you imagine why any comment including "playing wow too much is a waste of time" explicitly or implicitly is down voted a lot?  Some crazy people in this Reddit.  Thx for your kind replies so far.
---
That's my expierence too. Pull as many mobs as you think you can handle, then nova + flamestrike + CoC and if anything still moves just finish it with arcane explosion. The only downside is that it's using a lot of mana, so using gear with lots of int is always a good idea.
---
Using the whole shatter combo might even be a bit overkill for that dungeon though.
---

Is there a fishing spot where I can farm both Nightfin AND Winter Squid? Or is it just one or the other?
---
Normally I would fish in Azshara, but only with hopes of finding a water pool for water essence. But thats been hard to come by, and I barely find Winter Squid there, so would prefer to just farm both Nightfin and Winter Squid in some body of water if you guys know
---
Generally speaking:. 
---
Fury is more geared towards dual wielding, and single target DPS.  It sacrifices survivability for damage and is usually the primary warrior DPS spec.
---
Arms focuses more on 2-handed weapons and big hits with mortal strike.  It's the best spec usually for PvP, as well as "melee cleave" groups.  Also generally recommended as the best levelling spec
---
Are you okay?
---
Complaining people (obviously not a minority) will either: stop playing, make a new character on PvE. If they make it possible to transfer to a PvE server they won't lose the first group of people.
---
This would still be a huge pain in the ass in resto specc
---
Phasing between zones most anoying laggy shit ever.
---
ok boomer
---
I hate you. Gz.
---
What discussion? All we have is low quality memes and screenshots.
---
Can't you use NS for damage too? If they have content on farm he should be able to go 30/0/21.
---
Maybe caps at 25g because my next slot will cost me 25g if I decide to buy it.
---
Isn't kick on the GCD as well in vanilla, and not in retail? Please correct me if I am wrong.
---
&gt;pserver world pvp battles probably took most if not all of the population on the server
---
Lmfao what?
---
I said 11,000 people. I bet most blizzard servers don't even have that many
---
If they do it, PVP servers will be PVE servers except for the 5% of players who stay on the minority faction.
---
why wouldnt i be ?
---
I can rember my DPS going up substantially in BC when I got a new GPU.

Going from that 20fps to a 60fps was huge back in the day lol.

---
I understand that feeling. And that's exactly why I restock on arrows every time I'm in a city.
---
But carrying more than 18 stacks of arrows? That's 3,600 arrows. More than enough for anything.
---
Maybe I'm aware of my arrows stock because I have bagnon add-on and can always see my arrows when I open my bags.
---
You hardly train any skills as a warrior anyway. Maybe rend for the first few ranks and thunderclap if you really want to. Sunder and the shouts of course, but that’s really it.

Gold

Can also throw in the minority of us idiots who haven't played in forever and remembered vanilla as Ally having more people and BG queue times and Horde being the underdog and instant queues.  By the time I realized I might have made a miscalculation I was 60 and all the alliance were taking free transfers off the server.
---
305 WS +6% hit, all your abilities will hit, yes. Off-Hand Swings still have a high chance to miss (wenn noch HS/Cleave queue).
---
Then downvote comments that did not add to the topic/discussion and move on. Like I did with your comment.
---
Did you just ask people who pay $15 a month to *do blizzard's job?*
---
That's honestly the most impressive mental gymnastics I could possibly imagine. The cognitive dissonance must be destroying your brain so as a last ditch effort you spit out "players should do Blizzard's job for them"
---
I would like you to land at Thorium Point and move to UBRS as alliance. Let me know how that went.
---
What EU server is biggest and most populated by hordes?
---
It's been three months exactly...  
---
Have you lost all sense of time playing classic?
---
Congrats you're still a child!
---
Just to be clear, gonna play devils advocate here. What's the solution? Back to layers? Since it's a PvP server you can't really take away peoples ability to kill players of the other faction, that's what normal servers are for.   
---
I personaly don't see a solution that doesn't change the nature of the servertype or the game as a whole  
---
Once again before I get downvote-spammed, I'm playing devils advocate here, I hope there is a solution coming since this can't be good for the health of the game
---
Also, I can not imagine how it will be in the BGs when everyone is using rocket boots, death ray and who knows what else. In the days of vanilla you knew that you will win if you survive his mana/health potion. 
---
I think in all this years not playing WoW I underestimated how much the player mentality changed. Today's PvE servers are probably the Vanilla's PvE servers.
---
You are what the medical community refers to as "low functioning"
---
The alliance crushed the horde in the first weeks on Zandalari tribe, BRM was a fucking chore everytime. Now it's a complete desert, there's some pvp at kargath and the entrance of searing gorge/badlands or southshore but not much. Most of the people I played with play a lot less, leveling is a chore as bored alliance 60 will kill you on sight. Hell they raided orgimmar with around 300 people 2 weeks ago and we were just about a full raid to defend, of course they completely killed us all and got thrall with no problem, the server lags were more of a resistance than we were. They did azuregos with 15 people uncontested. I don't even think our Horde/Ally ratio is bad, the horde was just unorganized and got just crushed. Can't imagine how bad it must be on heavily unbalanced servers.
---
Re-roll PvE (or Horde). Seriously, no shame, it'll make your playtime much more enjoyable. It's unlikely Blizzard is going to be able/choose to fix this issue anytime soon, since all the solutions I've seen have big downsides that affect a lot of people. And if it turns out I'm wrong, you just go back to your old toon.

This. 
---
I was outperforming our Deathbringer warrior with a Krol Blade/Mirahs simply because he hasn’t gotten Edgemasters yet
---
Classic has been out for longer than a month.
---
Based on your comment history, its a pony at best ;)
---
The only person making complaints about the lags you though nobody else has.
---
No they aren't. The only servers ran on blades, like Classic should run on with updated hardware.
---
Instead, Blizzard likely runs their servers on the cloud and shovels money into Amazon's bank account and that's why their entire infrastructure is garbage
---
I checked for it a couple of times when I was force res'd but didn't have the buff.  
---
Would there be something preventing the buff?  
---
My friend also said he didn't get the buff.
---
Twas mentioned in a q and a. As later down the track.
---
oeps, typo, but the awnsers remains the same
---
Just did WC yesterday with my Warlock and 4 Shamans. Shaman tank did better than most warriors or the bear I had earlier that day.
---
Am I the only person that wants nothing but to punch these "portal plzzzz zzzz gief zzz" and "gogogo trash plz faster gogo" people?
---
I can't even make a proper response to this steaming load of bullshit
---
That's literally called ***Moore's fucking Law***
---
And this is probably the biggest pointed people don't get. if the servers were actually s*** they would just crash over and over and over again anytime that there were 500 people in the same place stacked on top of one another.
---
But this actually maybe gives me hope that the AQ gate opening might not blow the servers up this time.
---
Thank you for that.
---
My brain hurts just reading that shit.
---
Yeah you can use NS for damaging spells, but its on a 3 minute CD for **one** instant cast.
---
Since he asked for advice on deep resto I doubt he is considering a respecc.
---
he most likely also does it on retail and will have enough gold to have all those accounts on game time purchased with gold
---
My fix would be to turn off pvp in 50% of the high-end zones, and then alternate on a weekly basis. Alternatively, let people craft an item that grants PvE flag for 1h. Some herbs, ores, and food perhaps...to drive up demand nicely.
---
The fact you even need to make this thread reflect what kind of a leader you are. I suspect these guys have good reason to be dissatisfied with your leadership. You may have good knowledge of the game and have good work ethics but your personality may be better suited to be a follower or officer rather than the leader. You scream weak to me.
---
It's almost impossible to imagine that within the confines of WoW with no extra incentives than gearing/gold that a good guild leader could have THREE officers plot against him. Not only that, but the guild leader, instead of taking immediate and obvious actions go on reddit to ask for "advice" or sympathy. Get it together and man the hell up.

It takes time to learn how to do it your way. Prepare yourself for wiping a couple of times, until you get the kiting right.  Just slowly dot down the bosses. You dont have to be a stacked moonkin to do this, neither do you have to be in the spec that the druid in this video is in. I do just fine in my healing spec, it just takes me a little bit longer. On top of that, this farming method is instanced, so you dont have to worry about pvp besides the way to the entrance. Requires you to have at least mining and preferably herbing also.
---
While I dont really like to acknowledge it, yes they do, now especially P2 is here. Feels like the horde are quite happy to gank alliance in their groups, camp Dire Maul and BRM but now as soon as they died twice while doing their gold farms they have cried foul at diabolical Blizzard for this unjustice, and the scum alliance who mercilessly camp them ALL DAY EVERY DAY /s
---
&gt; assuming everyone knows how to backdoor zerg.
---
they won't, and even if they did they won't be able to bring themselves to do such a forward thinking act. they'll tunnel vision into loss after loss, such is the way of the mindless horde.
---
I initially played on the US servers (as brother lived there and he introduced me to wow). I mind some raids being awful cos of the latency.  
---
When he moved back to the UK, right before tBC, we rerolled as we knew we'd catch up. Saw massive difference in game play.
---
Fish are either ocean or inland. Winter squid is an ocean fish, and Nightfin snapper is inland. So you should not be able to fish both in the same body of water.
---
You were willing to blacklist another human being based on your attention span being as short as that of my nephew‘s?
---
Kind of shitty. People like you should perhaps consider not blacklisting anyone. Including the hunter.
---
Right. So what you're saying is that they should completely axe their entire server infrastructure (which is industry standard now) and go back to doing things the 2005 way?
---
Have you worked in *checks notes* a business with any type of online aspect in the last 10 years?
---
you are right about their burst and also their fear/charm breaks. but you are wrong about sl lock. sl lock has more than %50 dmg mitigation(%20 from armor, %30 from soul link, %10 phys dmg reduction) afaik even tank warriors don't have that(%40ish i guess)
---
Succubus case was just an example. also even if they break, succubus charm has no cd, she can instantly cast it again. so rogue breaks and gets charmed again like 1.5 seconds later lol. not a big deal. i like using void tho, its a safer choice.
---
But anyway it doesn't matter what they break. sl lock is tanky as fuck, don't treat them as normal squishy cloth wearer. after it's locks' turn when rogue cc is over, insta death coil, shadow bolt during that 3 second and apply dots and go grab a tea. rogue is dead. 
---
My sl lock has 4.5k hp with double void shield, under shield locks can cast skills without knockback(or whatever you call it idk) so they can even fear rogue if they want to, but don't have to. i kill rogues and warriors by facetanking them. you do not burst 4.5k hp + 6.4k something shield with talent with %50+ mitigation on it. no one can burst that.
---
But when i was not a sl lock, there were many cases that i play bad or other classes play better and kill me. it was very usual. So anyway my point is same and never changes. SL lock is unkillable in 1vs1, need to do some very special things such as reflecting death coil, getting lucky crits or lock skills gets resisted etc etc.. there might be some cases that SL lock lose, but prob its like 2 out of 10 or something.
---
[Did you see my comment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1x0oe/that_alliance_players_still_log_into_pvp_servers/f8te863/) Whitemane horde here whos been in the rank12/13 brackets these first two weeks. I'm not having fun, I'm doing it because its the honor grind, its a grind no matter whether its world pvp or BGs. BGs are more fun but I did the warlord grind back in vanilla too, by the time you are midway into rank 12 spending all day in WSG or AB, it isn't "fun" anymore either.
---
That's why we do what we do 8)
---
This. Moderators should simply be enforcing flair violations, and leave the rest up to the votes and peoples flair filters.
---
Flat out incorrect. Nothing works this way in classic.
---
Wonder what a psychologist might say about that guys behaviour
---
Did you get one last week?
---
they prob didn't expect high burst of rogue on void and forgot to sacrifice it or didn't pay attention. it still doesn't change the fact that warlock can just sac the void before it dies. cc doesn't prevent that
---
BB to ratchet. not ideal, but I don't have the money to keep buying ports and at least there's *some* security on the docks. usually have to wait a couple boats until there's not a 60 waiting to kill you just off shore.
---
I don't think your assessment is correct either. If someone doesn't enjoy levels 1-30, they're unlikely to enjoy levels 30-60. 1-30 includes plenty of "fun stuff."
---
But how would faction based queues help at all for servers that don’t have queues?
---
Yep! I went to sergeant and 95% towards rank 4.   
---
I have an addon that calculated i would go to rank 5 45% toward rank 6.
---
It makes the game almost unplayable for me. Im lvl 53 atm and have to level via dungeon running since questing is impossible in my realm due to pvp (Firemaw, EU). But the chat lag makes it impossible to get into groups. Yesterday someone blocked me because he got my replies for joining a ZF run 15 minutes late and thought i was spamming him :(
---
I once killed some Alliance with some friends (3v5, we were outnumbered) and before the battle was even over I received a bunch of angry messages from a lvl 1 toon named “Lolurbad” informing me of how bad I was. “Lol ur sooooo bad srsly. U had to use Soulstone? LOLOLOLOL NOOB”. Before I could reply, he’d deleted the toon.
---
Pretty sad. But much sadder when you realize the guy, like the guy in OPs picture, was not 15 but most likely above the age of 30. 
---
Are people just more immature these days or is this game just full of man-children?
---
Yeah, at first it didn't sit that well with me, but I went to check before protesting against paladins and there really isn't many good +healing weapons in the early raids. The next major upgrade for both seems to be from Nefarian, but the drop chance for both the staff and the mace seems to be pretty low compared to mageblade. There is also Claw of Chromaggus, which might even be a small upgrade for mages and locks over mageblade because it has about 20 more spell power at the cost of crit. Still the best thing about mageblade seems to be its relatively high drop rate, so I imagine that 90% of raid geared mages, warlocks and paladin will probably hold onto it until at least AQ.
---
This is definitely not the way. If they wanted more responsibility they should have said so. Giving the gbank to someone that is attempting a coup is beyond stupid. Trust is broken and gone, he needs to kick them and let them make their own guild.
---
It's a total myth. When WoW launched, it was praised for its low system requirments. It was one of the game's selling points. Some portion of the playerbase presumably had really shitty computers, but it's not like having a potato PC was just the standard at the time. We're talking about 2004, not 1994. Same goes for the internet--unless you lived in the ass-end of nowhere, broadband and ~50ms was the norm. Online gaming was not invented recently. WoW isn't some kind of prehistoric game.
---
Yep. If that's what it takes.
---
No changes.
---
Or they could hire more people, smarter people, or just get better in general and make it work
---
Nah I had the video playing when I was running DM Tributes so I had to rewatch it afterwards.  
---
Nice of you though thinking you know my attention span or what might have been the cause of my error, sounds kinda shitty presuming you know me.
---
yeah but he logged in at Iron Forge.
---
how? you didn't know you can sacrifice void while cc'ed? cuz you can. sacrifice it, wait for cc to end, insta summon next one. easy gg.
---
&gt; -Generally private server players, who will have been playing Vanilla for years and will be generally* more skilled at Vanilla, understanding the meta, mechanics, etc.
---
Where is the footnote that asterisk is alluding to? Reeeeeeeeeeee.
---
You would think that a billion dollar company would have working, functioning servers?
---
Yeah its ridiculous hopefully maintenance will fix the problems with chat
---
Chillwind Camp is also a popular camping spot for Horde.
---
Nope, its just a PvE server at that point.
---
If I start to get farmed I just log out and do something else. No point feeding honor, however little, to the enemy while corpse running endlessly. It does mean that I’m never gonna hit 60 at this rate, but oh well.
---
its the faction imbalance
---
sometimes it takes me an hour to get to my instance because there are over 50 horde camping the path to get there
---
but the moment an alliance pvp group shows up my time to get to the instance drops dramatically
---
getting ganked frequently is totally manageable
---
getting ganked within 5 seconds of spawning every single time is not
---
the latter happens when one faction has 3x as many ppl or more
---
Hm , I'd understand it if you were perhaps 5% into Sergeant and dropper 20% and not enough to advance. But then it just seems like it is last weeks problem all over again. My rank didnt update until like midday last week.
---
Just want to add on that Warlocks BiS gears is much better than Mages BiS gears for PVP. Due to itemization of warlock gears. Warlock bis gears tends to have more stamina. Where as mage gears you will sometimes see +spirit which isn't very good for PvP. For example, Frostfire gears have +Spirit. I think Frostfire boots have +spirit on them. And the Frostfire boots is considered BiS if we ignore boots that give +fire or +frost dmg.
---
Gonna be honest i pretty much farmed rsptors/cats in stv from like 30 to 40, i slso had cooking and vendored all the food i made from the meat as eell stacks of food were about 30s each
---
QQ bro. Half the time horde have blackrock
---
&gt; Faction queues absolutely make the game MUCH more playable for minority factions.
---
And makes it *literally* unplayable for many since they are stuck in eternal queues.
---
I used to be top 5 with 10fps in BC.
---
Might want to not entirely rule out swords for orcs. There will be orcs with TF
---
It's not the players but the years of their experience to min max Vanilla gameplay. And all of it easily available on the Internet for everyone.
---
The development shouldn't be surprising and Blizzard should have anticipated it. If there's any blame then it's on them.
---
every other moment, it's even dangerous to log in at kargath
---
I respecced to ele and invested 50g in some spell dam gear at lvl 41. AND RIGHT NOW I AM THE GOLDEN MAJESTIC THOR GOD OF THUNDER!!! My dps is like 250 without any crits, and I make my lvling buddy warrior with flurry axe thrash blade and bis lvling items look like an idiot, as he isnt doing anything.
---
I dont see hardware being that huge difficulty factor.
---
Most vanilla dufficulty came from lack of knowledge.
---
Game mechanics were less understood and theory crafting was taking baby steps.
---
Its so bad on Firemaw! Im lvl 53 and can only level in dungeons due to all the pvp-ganking in questing zones. But it is impossible to find groups without chat. Even guild chat is laggy so not even guild runs is an option atm.
---
For the past three days my chat has been delayed by more then 15 minutes. Its crazy!
---
Shazzrah is certainly horde dominated but I have been surprised by the alliance holding their own with thanks to some very strong pvp guilds. Makes the world spicey!
---
Took me 45 minutes and 9 corpseruns last time
---
U think u do!
---
I love pvp. But as new player i suggest to join an pve server now.
---
Im still only getting the 1g tip thou. And whenever i ask for a higher price they act like i just asked to fuck their sister or something...
---
Havent played a shaman but rogues are pretty cruisy to play.
---
6pc shadowcraft +devilsaur is actually better than the biq list. the main issue is you lose all benefit when you get your first t1.
---
i've seen raiding rogues sticking to the 6pc with the 2 t2 pieces and doing well.
---
The problem works itself out when one faction leaves the server.
---
6%
---
I am not presuming shit. This is why mods don‘t allow witch hunts because some person like you - with no attention span whatsoever - decides to be a total tool and a jerkweed.
---
And then u get to say „oops my bad!“ maybe tell your guild to blacklist the mage as well, while you are at it ;)
---
Would it be madness to reroll on a PVP server right now? 
---
I've levelled to 40 on a PVE server but I genuinely feel like I'm missing out on a lot of the fun of spontaneous world PvP, despite the complaints on here. It would be on Alliance side. Feel like it would be fun to at least give it a try...
---
Lol this isn't retail where people are actually valuable for their skill and it doesn't matter cause there is no server interaction. This is classic, this shit actually does matter and I've seen multiple guilds end up dying because they didn't care. If you don't police people's behavior in your guild eventually people on the server will start to recognize your guild's name and will blacklist the entire guild.
---
had that IN gadgetzan on sunday, went offline for 3 hours only to be instagibbed again after log in by the same raid
---
You use 24 unique spells on a pull?
---
Ok, you also got USSR in your backpocket and the Trump-towers actually belong to you but just not right now?
---
you got me on that one xD
---
Better than me lol. Gah I'm trying to find screen shots from black temple with my shadow priest. 
---
I forget the exact numbers but I wanna say was like 20-30% better DPS.
---
Did they look into 2hand weapons like OEB at all or 2-handers are guaranteed to be dramatically lower DPS as 2-hand fury?
---
what dots are we using? i see only insect swarm which doesn't look all that powerful and a priest can dispel. What am I missing?
---
Also. I really like that second tri spec build with the thick hide. The only point I was trying to find a new home for was the single point in feline swiftness. I don't feel like I ever use cat form enough to justify the point there, but I don't see anywhere else to put it besides maybe nature's focus. Thanks for your response.

Literally none of those things in the third paragraph address the problem. And they are not ripping out their infrastructure to go back to a system from 15 years ago.

Like, my dude, I don't disagree that the servers are shit. I'm just trying to convey that this isn't a problem that can be fixed with a dozen extra developers and some elbow grease.

I said 'best idea', didn't say it was a great idea.

The OP demonstrated that old style servers solves the problem completely.

There's a solution and you're making up excuses to defend them. Running a blade server rack at HQ plugged into a fiber optic cable isn't that dramatic dude

I have an ele shaman as a pvp spec, and I just press 3 buttons and everything instantaniously turn to ash...
---
&gt; If my time in Vanilla and on pservers has taught me anything, it’s that almost everyone hates wpvp. 
---
Exactly. What's currently going on isn't fun. Certainly not for the victims or 3+ gank squads but I'm sure it's also very boring to those gank squads. They're basically trying to mine as many walking honor nodes as possible. There's no competition and no skill required. Actually encountering another group who fights back will be bad for both of them as it just wastes time.
---
Wow, you are truly a prophet to your people. I can only imagine how much better off this world would be if more people sought your advice. What more counsel can you offer us, the unwashed masses, O wise one?
---
Because people were not engaging with the map as much as this one so they didn't realize there is a huge race imbalance. thats the real problem. people would expect decent pvp MOST OF THE TIMES and they could be ok with getting griefed for some cases.
---
But there is no balance, so its all about griefing now. its different
---
Its not fun at all, its like a chore. But this is the only way to rank right now so you either do it or you fall behind. And for those of us who don't desire to level alts, and who already have full BIS outside of raids, there isn't anything to do other than PVP to progress your character. I already bought 4 months worth of raid consumes, 100 FAPs 100 LIPs, and an insane amount of nades, bombs and sappers so that I'd not need to farm again until I'm R13.  Its just the way it is. I can't wait for BGs, I'm counting down the days.
---
Always good to get rid of that pesky detect magic.
---
There isn't a huge amount of gold sinks in Classic, so inflation will reduce the value of your gold, albeit very gradually.
---
so u suck balls?
---
People are always over exaggerating over CC timers because they only look at the timers and not the actual lenght of the CC.

Can’t decide which librams to go for as a disc priest. Bus guides are pointing me in different directions.

same problem here, any way to force rank update??
---
only on pve-server tho
---
Yes. Hunters sell it from 20to 50g too, has dp and crit... Got it in one dm tribute run.. dont waste money guys!
---
Using innervate on a moonkin druid has to be one of the biggest wastes of resources possible in a raid encounter.
---
Picking sword tonight wuuuh
---
I cast it a second time!

I was 60 and up camping BT, after camping for awhile a high 30s hunter same faction shows up and asks if I was camping and I say "yes" he tells me he thinks it's a myth and I laugh...then it I see it with eagle eye and mount up and ride off...I can see he follows me on foot and I start taming. He then scares beats and I say WTF and he tells me roll for it...I say no...he messes with it a few times but I was able to get it and hearth out giving him the finger.  Such a punk.
---
&gt;Anything below 3.4ish speed is dogshit.
---
At level 18? DPS is way more important than speed at that level.
---
2007scape is the best subreddit. This subreddit will never be like that subreddit because it can never hope to be as good.
---
One work around is Discord. That doesn’t lag at all. Just sayin’
---
Because BG's will be a lot more efficient to get Honor than the current shit show of honor farm. The only reason it currently happens, is because it's the ONLY and as such most efficient way to get honor.
---
I only raid log at this point. Slowly running our of gold because I can't farm or leave ironforge without getting fistfucked in the asshole by a horde deathball.
---
AFAIK in that case only warrior can use FAP in this matchup only, not in other matches.   
---
So i guess you can count it down to FAP being usable for warriors, giving them the edge in 1v1.
---
Should have brought a mage, you could have lived!
---
Oh lord, the first week where you had to kill a named mob.
---
We had a queue system on the Centaur in the Barrens. My team arrived with two others before us. Gathered up a full group and waited for our turn. When it finally was our turn to kill him, some solo shaman grabbed him with an Earth Shock. Oh well, shit happens, waited 10 minutes for next spawn.
---
The SAME Shaman, who is now already done with the quest, runs past, gets the tag again, and fucks off. Now the queue system is in shambles, and its an all our brawl between 25 people to get the tag. Safe to say I did not get the quest done that day.
---
People are shitty.

Horde on Ashbringer (EU) or Heartseeker when trying to land in any neutral town
---
I’ve literally seen all those things in classic.
---
What we're seeing now is nothing like vanilla was like. It's a completely different game.
---
50ms was the norm xDxDxD  
---
    
---
In what universe?
---
I challenge you to get a 60 horde on firemaw. Fly to thorium Point and ride to the BRS entrance. Time it, count the deaths. do this with 2 hour intervals on a weekday and a sat/sunday. Let's compare notes when you're done. I promise you, dieing once or twice is not a comparable issue.
---
Nice calculations but could you incorporate something that a lot of guilds take into consideration: Rogue competition in raids. Some of these weapons listed above don't drop very often and when it drops you have to make a decision on wether you give it to a Fury Warrior or to a Rogue. Any thoughts/input on what to prioritize for Rogues and what for Fury Warriors? Would be appreciated.
---
I am a mage aswell and i do not get why you say "only 1g".
---
The rune costs what, 20s? You are making 400% straight up profit when someone gives you 1g. Mages usually carry runes around anyhow and it's literally just a click to cast the spell.
---
Atleast for water you have so spam it, you go oom, it takes some more time. But Portals are the easiest thing to do.
---
Asking for more than 1g is really just ripping people off.
---
Log off for 10+ minutes.  
---
Done.
---
For real though, I don't get why people get mad in this game, it's the easiest Survival game there is especially in PvP
---
Nah, I did, you are simply too dumb to understand it.
---
That makes /u/zaibuf  a big fat phony! Unless of course you're just lying, then that would make /u/Tekuila87 a big fat phony!

If it's for PvE, 150 mana is the best. You can also go 8 int if you don't wanna spend a bunch of time getting the thingy from BRD to make the arcanum, since people very rarely do BRD vault anymore. 8 int gives 120 mana (slightly more with BoKings if alliance) and a bit of crit, so it's barely any worse, and it's way easier to make that arcanum.
---
For PvP, 100 HP is what you want.
---
As a mage i will gladly roll on your blade, +7def is busted for PVP!!
---
Uhh humans are animals. Also I’ve seen animals covered in shit running around. Animals are definitely filthy in nature.
---
I play warrior and i love wf, so that left me with one choice :)
---
Apparently Earthfury used to be low-mid pop with a healthy ratio but it's becoming increasingly imbalanced as there's lots of Alliance transfering there. Don't have actual numbers but that's what someone else in here said a few days ago.
---
&gt;  these days
---
monkaHmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
You"d remember out of habit soon as you ran out of enough mana for shadow bolt.
---
Of course they are.
---
They should be free for some server/factions.
---
Aye the overwhelming majority of people are wonderful, a few rotten apples doesnt ruin the orchard ^^
---
By the time you reach 48, BGs will probably be out and the world should be a lot less chaotic. As long as you can stomach the occasional gank, you'll be alright.
---
Do you have an actual confirmed source for 15k though?
---
Its like you made this for me! 
---
I assume the difference between orc +5 and non-orc with edgmaster +7 in dps is that the glove slot can be used for dps increasing stats. Is that the 40 dps difference in the same setup with deathwish?
---
It's because it's the same demographic as wow. Go figure.
---
dude...
---
You should do LBRS first, no attunement needed. 
---
You can raid it with 10, but its designed for 5, and there are a bunch of quests you can only do in a party of max 5. It's a pretty simple instance, with only 1 tricky fight ( an event to summon an extra boss).
---
Do UBRS afterwards. It's a 10 man raid. You don't need attunement, but i guy in your raid needs the "key", which is made from 3 gems that drop in LBRS + a questchain. UBRS is quite straightforward, but there are some places where a noob could wipe the raid, so either read a guide or pay attention during your first run.
---
&gt; Are people just more immature these days 
---
Do you really think this didn't happen before Classic?
---
I think mages are more in demand than rogues for dungeons.
---
Just bear in mind that 50-60 is rough on a PvP server. I've had an awful time trying to go from 52-60. Every enemy player that sees you will kill you because it's worth the honor they receive.
---
Thanks I will
---
There's really not a lot to do at 60 in classic wow, at least not yet.
---
I advise to try to enjoy the leveling experience the best you can rather than rush through it
---
the regular rez never requires an ankh. the reincarnation (self rez) requires one. you get it at 30
---
I'mma just ignore you I guess. There is no point trying to argue with you since you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
What level should I be to start tanking BRD? I've never been and I've heard it's huge, so should I as DPS once or twice first?
---
I think the odds for the first tie for any two people is 1-(0.99)^39=0.3243 and for the following ties it’s 0.01 each so 0.00003243 or 1 in 30835. 
---
Sorry if formatting is a mess, I am on mobile.
---
mace &gt; axe &gt; sword for human
---
What? That's not the argument at all, of course any individual can play at their own pace, but they cannot escape the meta, i.e. if you're still leveling on a PVP server you will be ganked repeatedly without hesitation.
---
Isn't libram for paladin and paladin only?
---
You do lose time though, and killing you when you get a jump on me is even more fun. You cant have that on a PVE server
---
2h fury is great, the #1 allstar dps on warcraftlogs is 2H fury with a BRE.
---
Yes, but people will be in there because of bindings and sulfuras. And there will be plenty of folks just reaching the content. It only appears that everyone is blasting through on here because these are the most dedicated players.
---
Clearly Qui-gon would've taught Obi Wan if he wouldn't have gotten ganked
---
I’d go with the rogue if your leaning more towards that to begin with. I’d roll undead for will of the forsaken. Since it’s your alt bro just have fun with it don’t worry about what’s sought after you did your part with your priest. I though would alt on my same server so I have gold to send over. And if your going rogue some sweet enchants are fun. I main a lock and just made an alt rogue dual cruel barbs with fiery weapon on them is going to be sweet. I have fuel black water cutless’s with fiery wep and at level 16 I’m like 2 shooting mobs still. Can easily take on 3 mobs my level and still be at around 75% hp. And was able to start off with super high first aid because my main.
---
I hate you so much it is unbelievable.
---
On my server it depends where you go. If you go halt you should die ~12 times if you go straight from halt to BRM doors, it can be reduced to 6/7 if you're smart, like going though the underground dwarf area. Then from BRM entrance to MC entrance it's like 5/6 corpse run ? In this part you'll instant die on repop. You can wait for ally raid which typically reach BRM before getting wiped
---
I'm on the horde side, so I have plenty of time to admire how it works, and you should never ever go from the Halt side, it's hell, but if you do try to be smart, bruteforce can take up to 1 hour
---
Don't go to Dragonfang.
---
It's the worst realm I've seen since 2004. It's almost dead and most people who play there are somehow AT THE SAME TIME tryhards AND noobs AND ninjas.
---
I took the free server transfer there from Golemagg back when queues were at 20k+ and I leveled my first char there. I'm not waiting for paid character transfer to leave that shithole and bring it back to my new alt/main's realm.
---
Usually Tuesday at 8ish pm. If you go to orgimmar or stormwind and see a shit ton of people near the AH just stay there for a bit
---
It’s happening on Shazzrah too every now again but never got as bad as firemaw. Worst it was was a 5 min delay on chat here.
---
LASER TURKEY. I just laughed so hard i spat out my coffee during a meeting at work...
---
&gt; There's no reason
---
delusional
---
Seems about right, but that's assuming there's 40 people rolling for the bag. Onyxia raids can be done with 20 people or even less, so the exact odds can't be quoted.
---

Me and my friend were just baffled as to why it just wasn't added at release. People say they copied pservers but there is a lot that they didn't copy with itemization and honor system being two major things different than how pservers did it. 
---
We played pservers for 5 years on vanilla beforehand, we are both starting to say we liked them more.
---
Or if they add DW in classic that would be sick
---
Why is alliance and horde edgemasters version not the same in terms of weapons?
---
effing warlocks...yes...
---
Soulink spec is the best by far for solo pvp... You are so tanky its insane..  As for pvp gear you want alooot of stamina and spell dmg and int is mostly just a bonus on most pieces.
---
I wish we could do a server merger. I'm on Heartseeker as an Alliance and there is just no PvP. Nothin'. Merge Heartseeker with Stalagg to form a mega server, give me the ques, I don't care, as long as the game is fun while I'm in is all that matters.
---
&gt; nelf passive where you run faster as a ghost
---
it's a bit useless when you have a timer for rez because of multiple death, you get here earlier then wait for 2 minutes
---
they would literally get 0 dps from the additional talents...scary thought eh... You can already grab all DPS increasing talents as feral and oomkin. WITH ONE EXCEPTION! hotw would be pretty  nasty on an boomie, as you increase your manapool and crit chance.
---
Next you're gonna say, "I outsmarted you outsmarting!"
---
Gold is temporary. Glory is forever.

Oh sadness. Thread was deleted. Some good conversation here.

Really digging my geared out ele shaman but I want an alt. I love the burst and utility of my shaman but wish I had mobility. Big pvp guy. I love that my shaman feels useful compared to most dps classes. That was huge. 
---
Im thinking mage ticks all the boxes but they're incredibly over saturated. I also want to roll alliance this time for better queues, but I hate gnome mages, even though they're bis racials. 
---
I was thinking ne druid might be awesome. Crazy versatility, super useful in any situations dungeon/raids, looks fun, mobile and utility but the only thing I'm not sure about is there pvp capability. 
---
Would a pvp geared/specced druid be able to take 2v1s or really fair well vs most fights like my ele shaman? I get they're the best flag carriers, but I'd like meaningful pvp aside from just being a flag boy. 
---
Thanks.
---
You can do it even at 42, but there's no point doing it at 58. you won't get any XP and your priority should be to reach level 60 asap.
---
In my guild Fury Warriors have access to all 2H's and 1H Sword, Mace and Axes. Our Rogues have access to Daggers, 1H Sword and Mace.
---
i actually ran it with a 55 bear tank, we whiped on the last boss once - got the princess down the first try but died. and then had no problem with just the emperor after rezzing
---
MC Clears since week 3 - 0 Mageblade drops, 2 Eye of Divinity, 0 Obsidian Edged Blade, 0 Aurastone Hammer
---
I was tired of seing this like you and I made [this build.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005223105-3200550100050150231)  
---
I trade Endurance, Improved Sprint and 1 point in Ruthlessness to take Deflection. Like this, it's a minimal loss of DPS and I can play en PvE as I want.
---
Question is a bit harder if your guild is Alliance. As a Horde warrior I'd rather see Viskag, Brutally blade, and daggers go to the rogues. Then the warriors who don't plan on ranking can have the deathbringer and the warriors who want to rank get BRE and Spinal Reaper for 2H fury.
---
If I was an Alliance warrior, I'd probably want a Viskag/BB myself.
---
I agree. I recently moved to Ashbringer as alliance and it has been pretty nice so far. It's populated well enough to occasionally see a 5 minute queue and feels very active.
---
Pretty good ! Playing 14/32/5 and I really like it !
---
? Should be axes, daggers, swords
---
Savory deviate delight. One is epic mount and other is rare
---
But the princess respawns when you wipe. A small tip for tanking the boss: He really does crazy amount of damage when he uses his ability, so the best thing would be just to go up/down the thrown so he's never hitting you (only works if you already built sufficient aggro).
---
Na I think you nailed it
---
Not in most groups. Tie rolls keep rolling until the tie is broken. I actually saw someone get their item taken away for ninja looting using the "rolled the number first" thing because it wasn't commonly accepted loot rules, and the stated loot rules were the commonly accepted ones. (This was in retail, in WotLK)
---
They thought more people would quit within a couple of weeks.  Obviously they needed to botch phase 2 to achieve that and even then we still end up with way more.
---
My friend made me read the patch notes. I haven't played dota in like 5+ years but wtf is this even.
---
A what?
---
I thought this too, but then I tried the event for pally mount in Scholo.. shiiiet we werent prepared for that shit q;
---
I there a tiny threat stand alone addon? My Guild requires to have it for raids, but i dislike installing the whole Details Addon.
---
Nope, and no plans to update you on it either.
---
Assuming equal skill, an enhancement shaman can destroy:
---
\- priests, mages, locks, paladins, druids - against which you've got purge, grounding totem, tremor totem and earth shock.
---
\- perhaps hunters (citation needed)
---
(this doesn't take into account special items, professions etc; with engineering being what it is, all bets are off, it depends on who's got what equipped; let's be realistic here, not many people are questing while sporting their engineering boots, charge helm, invisibility devices, net trinkets, reflectors etc)
---
However, a shaman will never even scratch a rogue or a warrior (again, assuming equal skill). They simply have nothing against them. 
---
Of course, a good shaman will destroy bad rogues/warriors - but they'd have to be incredibly bad; we're talking "is that a bot?" levels of "bad".
---
Elemental shamans are so and so. They look great when they get the jump on someone; if they've got REALLY good gear (we're talking bwl level and above, at least having the nefarian mace and trinket, the nature bwl trinket) and certain items/professions, they look awesome. They're incredible in battlegrounds and other group-play non-pve scenarios. However, if they get jumped by a class that can interrupt, they're fucked and they've got nothing. A well-timed kick/pummel will send them on a corpse run (nature school being locked means no healing either).
---
A good rogue will kill you in a stunlock - not that they need to, but they could. No, being an orc doesn't help; that's all make-believe bullshit, the racial doesn't really do much in that regard.
---
A good rogue will kill any other class - no exceptions.
---
Most of the time, the outcome is decided by who's got what in terms of engineering gadgets and alchemy potions (obviously we're not talking about healing potions here...)

Okay , I’m a nelf Druid hotw/ns . Level 49, specced into hotw first, but I have plenty of points in resto too . When I’m solo I go feral but I have a really good healing set, and heal dungeons almost exclusively . I play w the same group of people so we know how to work together but everyone once and a while I have to pug, which is fine, but this leads to my question: it seems like whenever I pug for a group things don’t always go as smooth, obviously, but I find myself possibly needing oh shit heals way more and it’s kind of distressing because a big healing touch takes a while. I try to throw rejuvenate on them before hitting HT, but it barely mitigates damage if they’re really about to eat shit . I talked to a 60 Druid yesterday who told me only use rank 3, 5, 7 and 10 HT but rank three heals for like four hit points ?? And my hots barely heal for anything even max rank (7 or 8)I have a huge mana pool at 4200 so going OOM is usually not an issue, but I’m sure there’s more efficient ways to do this. I’m pretty sure I’m a good healer, I can play for 10 hours in dungeons healing because people whisper me asking me to or my friends are online , but people have criticized my lack of constant HOTs Or tank of HT . I might be letting it get to me too Much idk.  Quit tanking over some people always saying I was pulling too slow or too little lol so I’m afraid of being a bad player. Anyway thx for listen to my ted talk, and advice appreciated .
---
First the fishing video, now this. Soon every open world farm spot will be completely useless on high pop servers.
---
Yeah what the fuck is going on with this sub?
---
I got a question too, and you seem to know a lot about this topic. 
---
305 ws and 6% hit your attacks will not miss, but can they still be parried/dodged? 
---
I am using edgeaster (307 ws) and am hit capped, and I was under the impression that all of my yellow attacks would always hit - yet i still see dodg and parry. I guess I kinda gave myself the answer already, but it's always nice to have some clever person confirm how things work.
---
Because you just made a concern troll post about an unfixable issue and seemed to expect that for your genius views that the reddit community was gonna upvote to frontpage, you were gonna become a reddit influencer and be able to retire?
---
What did you expect?
---
Weak content = weak reaction. Of course I downvoted this trash.
---
Im playing on Razorgore and thank god for that. Probably one of the most balanced servers all around when it comes to faction balance.
---
It’s the end of black rock depths. You have to light two braziers with torches that you get off mobs in the room. But, there are packs on packs of wandering dwarves in there that spawn lightning fast so you have to aoe them down and move together to each touch Npc and each brazier. It’s a fun encounter and really shows how impressive brd is, because it’s not even the gate to the last boss.
---
Good idea
---
Why would you tell paying customers about game updates?
---
I should go buy a share of Activision, that would legally make me a shareholder. Then I might get some answers
---
The ability priority should stay the same, even if you don't have the proper talents for it. Be sure to find a comfortable balance of threat and mitigation gear and you'll be just fine
---
I'm lvl 43, this lvl 54 warrior chased me in circles across the badlands for a solid 15-20 mins... st first he had a friend (a priest, they tried to jump me) but the priest gave up and it was just him...
---
Eventually i got enough of a frost nova/poly off that I hearthed away
---
He /cried right before my last poly, poor guy lol idc why he even tried so hard
---
Is the rod the best alternative for a mage if neither Mageblade nor Staff of Dominance are an option right now? I'm almost full raid equipped but I'm still using the damn Hypnotic Blade in conjunction with Spirit of Aquamentas. It's hard to find a replacement because SoA is nice, but I've no problem with switching to a staff if it's an considerable upgrade.
---
&gt; gold being farmed towards 60% mount
---
I really, really hope this was a typo and you didn't grind to 60 without any mount.
---
I thought for sure server improvements were going down yesterday, cause of the extra down time. But nope! It took 30 mins for the head buff to finish on herod last night... half that time was trying to respec...
---
People playing horde on pvp servers during phase 2 legitimately seem to not understand that since alliance are more passive/generally pve oriented players and horde are generally the hyper aggressive spergs... this is resulting in death runs to every dungeon for alliance. Not to mention the 10-30% faction imbalance in horde favor on every pvp server.
---
Yeah but it’s actually useful in arena
---
You didn't contribute anything meanoingful.
---
Ah, right, some people farm the eye. I was really lucky with it, managed to buy it from a guy in /Trade for 330g. From then on the price just kept rising. A few days ago I saw the price above 900g.
---
Unfixable issue?

---
Been there. Done that.
---
Yes they do, its effectively the same as they running away in fear. If they get too close to "allied" mobs then they will pull them.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions guys.  
---
What I did:  
---
Grindspots: Felwood northern Furbolg camp, Winterspring western Furbolg camps, 
---
some BRD solo. As a rogue u can stealth to the guzzler, buy all beers and lure the mobs into the room behind Plugger. Try killing them b4 they reach the beer and every beer will get you 3-5 mobs pulled. After you solokill plugger in the end you take the beers off the table. This rewards okayish xp but also some gold and u can get some decent loot from plugger.
---
Use LFG chat?
---
Go Warrior :)
---
Tank all the way until 60 in Arms. Spec Prot when you reach 60, farm your BIS for fury while tanking. Once you have good gear, swap to Fury and bam, you are set and having tons of fun.
---
Now you have a melee class and you had no problems finding group as tank.
---
Exactly this. 
---
Everything they delete and do in this Sub is to have a ncie Environment for the majority of People. 
---
As we all know the minority is usually much more vocal so I think it is fair to say that the Moderators are doing a good Job. 
---
They don't delete memes because they think we don't deserve to see them but to assure that crap memes stay out of this Sub.
---
They spend their free time on reading through reddit comments. We all know how low reddit comments can sometimes get :P
---
So +149845 for the Mod's.
---
I also don't agree with the comment above that they are rude when you ask them why smth. has been removed or why someone was banned. 
---
They tell you how it is. You can't really say that in a way that doesn't appear to be rude towards the Person that got a punishment for it. It just is the way it is :P
---
Always Sender and reciever and I think the message got out the right way. I think the People being told why they got punished are just butthurt
---
Well in fairness this sub could do with less shitposts and lvl 40 mount screenshots.
---
This is spam.
---
The 2 timeR
---
Alliance spams stuff like this in /yell too, it's funny and not offensive. I think you're looking a bit too far into this.
---
So i have to wait another to get a crap piece of T1? Nah i just play solo now, fuck people :)
---
Yes you can still get dodged/parried, to combat that we'd need expertise which isn't in vanilla.
---
Excuse me?
---
Good advice tho. Ty
---
TIL the DNC has a WoW guild
---
&gt; PVP was going to be on a PVP server
---
Saying this instantly shows you have the mental capacity of a blade of grass. If you don't know what you're talking about, stop acting like a clown.
---
I don't know about SK, but the choker is a very, very good item for casters and healers. Congrats.
---
Can confirm. Almost wiped the raid on Onyxia by chugging a mana pot just as she was landing. Managed to blink to the tank just before a breath hit, so only 3-4 people died (myself included) and we still got her down.
---
A lot of people also remember the pvp from 2006 vanilla which had all the bgs, anyone who really wanted rank 14 prob was or tried already, and most of the raids were out. Very few of the vanilla pop was around for the time when this era of the game was out.
---
I allways go for the sword on human warriors for sword spec and the fact that you won't have MS for a while. If you want a high dmg weapon you can get an axe from the SM quest and if you want to stay with swords you could get the one from Uldaman shortly after that aswell.   
---
But for other races axe would be the go to weapon.
---
How is it profitable? I didnt know you could really make money with it
---
All the greater blessing gives the same threat, its just kings and sanctuary cost the least amount.
---
Silithius is considered the best safe spot right now, so it's pretty obvious some gank squads will go there eventually.
---
Yah well most people dont want it to turn into facebook as well, with the examples that OP provided (scenery bullshit, sky box bullshit, dinging 60 etc"
---
Is there a way I can check faction balance on a server?
---
Getting constantly feared off the boat by high level warlocks is the fucking worst...I think the dock and harbour should be non pvp.
---
I do the same (tanking in raid furry). I just wear plate. Only 3-4 pieces has defensive stats. Rest of items are just str agi stam. It is important since geetining into full deffensive gear leaves you without rage.
---
As for priority - revenge - BT - sunder (do not use shield block on trash and rarely on bosses). I always have berserker rage on pull. I use whirlwind on pull of 3-4 mobs with stance dance macro to get initial aggro. 
---
And i spam to party chat on beggining of instance - WE WORK SCULL THEN CROSS. ON MIDDLE HP OF CROSS YOU CAN AOE.
---
For a living corpse.
---
Just fix the chat servers ffs it's not hard, while you're there fix the lag on the servers too
---
Made me think of this classic:
---
Stop using stone. [Try Bronze! It's brilliant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyu4u3VZYaQ)
---
thanks for your suggestion, but i would loose the retail files, which i dont want. i just want outsource retail to an external. maybe copying the whole thing first, pointing the bne launcher to that directory and then uninstalling the smaller wow classic application is the way to go then. afterwards i will reinstall just wow classic to the sdd from the launcher. thought there would be a way without de- or reinstall thouh.
---
He wants to jack them off
---
Oh awesome, been hoping something like this has existed
---
Okay good, so not this universe then :)  
---
Because what you're describing was far from the "norm" in the one I live in.  
---
Just googling the situation shows explosive growth from 2005 until now, that only tiny portions of the average developed country having decent connections at that point in time. Not even in South Korea or Sweden were \~50ms connections even close to being normal, but something only the select few had the realistic opportunity to obtain.
---
Played vanilla and didn't notice huge difference in p2.All out war is fun for many ppl.
---
P2 being this short sucks and Activision is rushing with bgs and phases perhaps they want to end Classic right before Shadowlands or what..Its a pity
---
It's an option. Each loot system has upsides and downsides. It's rather similar to DKP and thus has the same issues. It is very possible that the people above you has decided to save for a mageblade or something similar.
---
The game isn’t about getting transported places and finishing quests - explore, make your way there on foot, enjoy the journey. You’re close to Silverpine in UC now so just work your way out.
---
I don't know if it is possible to install in two different folders, but if not you could do it with some symlinks trickery:
---
https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/
---
Copy the retail folder to the HD, use symlinks to point from the retail folder to the _classic_ folder on SSD.
---
What is the difference in Dps with DB/flurry compared to DB/bone slicing hatchet with ele sharpening stone?
---
theres enough lag naturally i dont think the forced 200ms spell batch is necessary
---
It's not unpopular truth, it's a common opinion. Even blizzard knows it should work. It's like saying "The train should come in time" after hearing that it will be delayed. Everyone has your opinion that things should work, the downvotes don't mean that people disagree with you, just that it's unneccessary to say things so obvious.
---
70/30 and worse balance is the part that sucks for me personally. Wpvp honor is awesome when that's not an issue. If they hadn't skewed the balancrs so bad with the initial wave of transfers it'd be great.
---
Suicide Kings is a loot system where the entire roster is organized into a list. When an item drops, the top player gets the option to "Suicide" and get moved to the bottom of the list in order to receive the item. You move down the list until someone suicides for the item. It's rather similar to DKP and has the same issues.
---
“Treating others fairly and with moral integrity”
---
Lol obviously not
---
Yeah but, Whirlwind Axe is BiS.
---
Best in style.
---
Hahahahaa fml how did u find me
---
Yep,  kronos 3 did this method of honor in the beginning.  A 55/45 horde to alliance ratio became 65/35 abs completely ravaged the server. I can already see the damage done to my server on classic with many transfers.  It was a bad idea.
---
/me emotes aren't translated tho, they just show up  as "name makes some strange gestures"
---
the undercity has an amazingly layout once you learn it and enjoy getting dizzy
---
Just because Horde dominate 70% of the servers doesn't mean this shit is alliance only.
---
When you look at UC map at 9 oclock youll a small tunnel. Take the  sewers out and this will lead you down to Sep. The exit is on the bottom level, outer ring. 
---
The other main way out is to the 12 oclock but its a bit more of a maze till you get the hang of it.
---
All good my friend
---
It's fine people still run rfc up to mc nothing to worry about
---
I agree that it would most likely would never become pvp anymore. But I think the faction queues won't solve anything, it will just make (horde) people quit. Which in my eyes is worse.
---
Because I don't wanna be a boy in blue
---
Hello everyone Which  class would you recommend between warrior or Paladin if I want to mainly pvp ( more solo than in a group) and not have to rely so much on others in order to survive or kill a target. I have read that warrior can have the highest dps but aren't very well in solo situation while a paladin  can have some burst but least consistent dmg compared to the warrior, but what they lack in dmg make up for in their utility. So should I roll warrior even though I want to play more solo in pvp rather than group or would you recommend paladin,  due to them having more utility. Also if I do roll Paladin how hard would it be to gear it in your opinion/experience. Thank you
---
&gt; Stack strength, agility, crit %, and stamina? Basically gear yourself like a rogue or kitty druid.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I know you said that you understand it sucks, but I feel obligated to mention that this is probably the worst DPS you could possibly imagine in a PvE setting. Like, you'll be jealous of boomkin DPS bad.
---
check out the [Melee](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1542) Hunter Pve Guide it goes into heavy detail about how to play a melee hunter successfully.
---
1% hit = 1% extra wihte damage.
---
white damage = 50% of oyur total damage
---
Therefore 1% hit = 0.5% dmg
---
And probably a bit more than that due to rage generation and avoiding rage droughts.
---
Glad to hear you’re having so much fun. The community really is great.
---
There are a few whiners who will always try to negatively influence why you shouldn’t be so satisfied.
---
Ignore them and make up your own mind. 
---
It really is a lot of fun 🤗
---
I personally love wpvp, howerver it only works when servers are balanced. Otherwise its a shit show. One side is constantly ganked by other side who is desperate for honor due to lack of enemies to kill.  Meanwhile free transsfers are available, but nobody knows where to move because there is no proper data on server populations.  I play on alliance side and lack of horde to fight with also sucks bad. Maybe not as bad as being dead constantly but still bad.
---
Yeah I get it, I made the joke saying it's impossible because the event is extremely rare on certain servers, which is true.  Again, small brain.
---
Nah man, I spend HOURS a day patrolling Ungoro so a couple of my Guildies can quest. I get ganked sometimes, they get ganked sometimes, and sometimes I do the ganking. Sometimes you just gotta grind, even if it sucks.
---
Find me the server that ever had 10k players, I'll wait.
---
You wouldn't happen to be Chimi from Stalagg?
---
Based god
---
Don't know how valid this info is for you but I did the whole instance 2 days ago at level 56. Tanked as arms warrior. Went smooth. Some pulls to know about like someone else said but with some luck with your group people might be happy to guide you along. Good luck.
---
No, I logged in at Thorium Point. Got ganked there 3 times had to buy my corpse and HS to IF. Then flew to SW and went AFK and was dead when I came back.
---
I got so tilted i got off at 6 pm peak hours straight up unplayable.
---
Because then classic will be seen as a real product?
---
I did read it, did you read what I said?
---
Man, I wish more of these "look at this dumbass" posts had timestamps enabled, it makes it so much funnier when you can see that the wipe happened just a minute after he's talking big.
---

---
I would personally prefer to see a meme pop up on my thread than someone’s ding post. Though I’m not playing the game currently might attribute to my tastes of what pops up for me
---
It wouldn't be so bad if it was just a worse way to get honor on the side as it will be when BG's are released. But wPvP as only source for honor? To think that would turn out well for most players is naïve as fuck.
---
I really hope that BG's will reduce the current shit show to near the level it was before the honor system was released.
---
Is there any other option?
---
HotW/NS build is require level 60, to get both key parts - 5/5 HotW and NS.  
---
Before that I don't recommend it. Also I won't recommend hybrid builds for newcomers. It require player to be better than average for both roles.  
---
Why people recommend you low level HT? Because of +healing items. With +300 healing your low level HT will heal for 800-1000 HP and cost ~150 mana. IIRC that's the best health-per-mana spell in the game.  
---
Unfortunately around level 49 you won't have much +healing gear, so this recommendation also falls short on you)  
---
(And I don't like level 3 HT. It's 0.5 faster than levels 4+, this is why people recommend it. But it have very crappy spell coefficient, and this means very low healing. But at least you will land your heal faster than priests\shamans\paladins :))  
---
If you spec into proper rest build, you will get two instant heals - Nature Swiftness and Swiftmend. This will help you to deal with damage spikes. Before that - you need to cast Healing Touch preemptively. Don't wait for your tank to take a hit - start HT cast before he is getting hit.
---
&gt; needing oh shit heals way more and it’s kind of distressing because a big healing touch takes a while
---
This is what nature's swiftness is for. It's a 1 min cooldown so unless you're having to hit that "oh shit" button very very often this is your solution. 
---
I believe you can even make a macro with NS and HT so it's literally just one button. I highly recommend naming the macro "OH SHIT" because that's exactly what it is.
---
even better u'll get the true vanilla experience of playing on a mostly established server, where this isnt a large herd of players warping the experience, at least until you get to the end level zones that is
---
Well if he plays on a server like faerlina then yeah you coulda predicted this...
---
Lots of characters of the different level brackets hard at work. Everything's great
---
That was what i missed about classic. Sending you to the other side of the planet to do a random q to progress.
---
99 percent of the time one thing occurs.  1 percent of the time the opposite occurs.  You would be stupid to equate them as 50-50.  You would also be stupid to think this matters because of le alliance or le horde.
---
Meanwhile I know two guilds that got both bindings in a single run within 3 weeks of each other.
---
He crashed upon the Horde and destroyed them. Good times.
---
As alliance in heartseeker believe me when I say I actually do not like this. It sucks. I want to farm honor but there is no way to except what he is talking about. I’d prefer to find groups that are looking for it but so hard to when all the alliance is out looking for them. 
---
With these server unbalanced we need bgs today not two weeks I get to enjoy the pve still as I’m alliance but somewhat frustrating. I would say to u horde on heartseeker though I feel like if u got 5 people u could have a lot of fun pvping just be prepared to change zones a lot so u don’t get overrun
---
&gt;"Ha ha! I'm glad it's happening to YOU on another server!" fix or acknowledge the bigger issue which is we cannot play the game!
---
How would you like me to fix the issue for you?
---
You can uninstall it then reinstall it to a different location afterwards you quit bfa (assuming you do not use it to make machinima
---
Great analysis.
---
They use shared data files, so you'd have to have copies of files, wasting space. I think the bnet launcher only looks for wow files, it doesn't have retail and classic as separate games (probably because of the shared data)
---
Let's all spam aoe's and then complain the servers aren't working!
---
Yes, possible.  
---
Just make sure that other character have corresponding riding skill  - like Tiger riding or Wolf riding.
---
Have a similar question on my mind: Iwould be interested in the difference between DB/DB and DB/Flurry.
---
Is it a significant one or nort?
---
You should really take my post as sarcasm.  I'm not actually glad.
---
But it be like that tho
---
You need Jesus
---
Your average Asmon fanboi "Can i turn off pvp? 😢"
---
Solo farming DME as a warlock is not easy and has a steep learning curve, and kind of requires gear
---
Mind elaborate on that because it sounds very awful in practice
---
I've cleared Mc every lockout since the fourth week the game was out. Elixir of shadow power and flask of supreme power. I now outgear every hunter in my raid. Thanks to itemization I have more hit than I should during this part of the game. Womp womp. Hunters have always and will always be B tier dps.
---
lol
---
This would also help and encourage entire guilds to move over, since there would be time to organize sign ups as a group/guild , one of the things i think stopping large groups is that feeling in the launcher where its like "well is everyone transferring?", but with your idea you could see in game 64/80 guild members signed up for transfer
---
Oblivious to what
---
I'm on Pvp server. I'm 57 holy priest. Yesterday was last day to login. People in BRD were a little toxic. Going there took one hour. I could do only BRD for weeks, but it's too hard to get there. No chance to give and take quests... I will wait until January
---
Months and months from now people will still be running MC, you don't have to worry about missing a thing, take your time and enjoy the game :)
---
cuz im lazy and my guild needs me
---
Lol OK I don't watch asmon cause I'm so new to the game that I dont understand anything happening on stream.
---
delete calssic, move retail, reinstall classic in the folder you want,
---
not you have them seperated and only have to redownload the smaller one
---
It was a from a website called thedailyblink. I haven't seen these in years.
---
My favorite was the human warrior iron man one. It used to be my phone desktop for years. I could slide page to page, and it would line up like a tier armor wardrobe.
---
Have no clue what eventually became of the artist.
---
Once again there are stealth macros and ways to resurrect and go right into stealth.
---
&gt; Melee hunter is going to be gimped DPS, but with all the utility a hunter brings it's far from useless if the hunter has half a brain.
---
Nope, melee hunters are calculated to be the highest dps achievable by a hunter in the game. However, it requires proper gearing, rotation, etc... This is my speciality so I am happy to talk about it more.
---
Laughs in PvP.
---
By that logic i can ask people to turn my cloth into bandages for me for free. I wont thou because unlike most players i realize that time has value. 
---
No, at this point with 5k gold on me im the guy who walk past 1g lying on the street.
---
I would go sword'n'board.
---
Revenge immediately every time it's available.
---
Sunder when revenge is not available.
---
If rage is building up towards 100 and you have 2+ targets, ragedump with cleave.
---
Remember that berserker rage increases the amount of rage you gain from damage taken. Make a habit of activating it at the start of every fight (e.g. immediately before charging in).
---
The whole point of playing is to have fun man it's not a job. You can make any class work
---
LOL
---
thank you all for your answers!
---
i copied the whole wow folder to an external. uninstalled classic from launcher, copied a classic install from a computer that had classic only. pointed the bnet launcher to the install of classic and all is good.
---
I got two with my Pally-Alt who killed Ony ...twice. :D
---
Thanks!
---
Does it tick for 5 every second, or are the ticks longer but bigger?
---
Thanks for this, seems like really good information.
---
I'm feeling a small karma satisfaction from all the times someone would say something like "reroll PvE if you can't handle PvP" and generally making PvE servers out to be some sort of a carebear/loser choice. I knew phase 2 would be a shit show and I chose accordingly.
---
So that being said, I can understand where the "oh no PvP happened on a PvP server" kind of sentiment is coming from.
---
We are all a bunch of neerds with to much free time and i love it.
---
Because all alliance races are fucking trash
---
someone else mentioned Silithus. it's great for stealth-mining ooze-covered veins. blue sapphires and arcane crystals have a x2 higher drop-rate from ooze veins than they do from regular rich thorium veins. my only caveat is competing with rogues. they have the upper-hand on druids with vanish. rogues can pull off much more daring raids on the bug hives with stuns, gouge, sap, vanish. they can cc the bugs and play around their cooldowns to mine the ooze veins without fighting, whereas you actually have to take a minute to kill an elite bug. even if you spot an ooze vein before the rogue, there's a good chance he will catch you at low health while you are fighting an elite bug, then he'll finish you off and take the loot for himself. for this reason, you absolutely need a few things before attempting this farm on a high-pop pvp server. you need some stealth talents from feral instinct, advanced target dummies, speed enchant on boots, movement speed trinkets, and an epic mount. I would even recommend teaming up with another druid so he can spot for you up above, faerie fire any rogues that follow you into the hive, and go searching for more veins spawns while you slowly stealth through the hive.    
---
I don' t have mining as a profession anymore. I miss doing silithus runs... they are actually really fun once you get the hang of it. now I'm just farming rock elementals in badlands for solid stones, because the prices sky-rocketed on my server with high demand for sapper charges. a stack of 20 solid stone is worth about 7g on my server and a single sapper charge sells for 3.65g. you can handle 4 or 5 rock elementals at a time with moonfire spam, barkskin + starfire, then go into bear (they are immune to nature dmg so no hurricane).
---
You state like that guy is the only one camping Broken Tooth for a long time. Broken Tooth is known to be sought after and everyone is waiting their time to get theirs. It is wrong to justify what he did 'because he has been coping the mob for 30+ hours'. What he did is a shitty move, period
---
Yeah unfortunately but you can still piss off everyone in org or IF
---
Now that does not add up with your first claim. That a blue geared warlock out dps a hunter in full MC gear.
---
You will soon understand, don't worry. And then you will regret your choice or indulge in getting shat on by the Horde. Especially if you join one of the 1000 asmon fanboi guilds. Just puts an even bigger target on your back.
---
It's not that I am having second thoughts, it is more of, "Oh look a rogue stealthed by, maybe I'll make a rogue?" "Oh look a druid ran by, maybe I'll make a druid." 
---
What I'm saying is no matter what class I am playing I will covet into someone else's character as they run by over and over. I truly want the warrior to work out.
---
OK zoomer
---
We do not make reposts here, sir.
---
How dare you had a reasonable unbiased view on the subject. It's all or none! Exaggerate and act like everyone's quitting because it's so bad!
---
Alright this makes fair sense. I want to add though, Blind is a 10 yd range, so it kinda only helps you a lot if you're in a good spot already, i.e. close to the mage.
---
As a prot warrior who has been rather quick to lvl 60 I cant tell you how much I hate having to listen to my mage buddy talking about gold. The dude is literally printing gold all on his own by farming ZF 2hrs a day. He has his epic mount and about 600g to spare rn. Me on the other hand...I was just starting to make some profit collecting black lotus and brewing greater fire prot potions when Phase 2 rolled out. Now I cant farm shit. I can literally not do anything alone without investing in a respec because the only thing I can beat in a 1v1 is a poorly geared rogue that kills himself by giving me revenge procs. As soon as there is a range player I am done for in prot spec. Getting to lbrs (which I only do for gold, since I already have full pre-raid bis) takes like 40minutes depending on Horde presence.
---
I dont blame blizzard though, because all of this was predictable. I shouldve known that life sucks as a warrior if you are not no lifing. I did know to an extend, but I had no idea how bad it would be. I will most likely stop logging in from now on
---
Your good! I have a 50 lock 43 war 33 rogue 26 priest 14 mage and 9 shaman! I am an altaholic but I have no problems finding groups for stuff like dungeons or elite quests.
---
I recommend joining world and /lfg
---
Sometimes I’ll be chilling on my lock and see “SM GY group looking for healer can summon” boom I jump on my priest and am summoned away to heal a dungeon while my lock is back at the inn.
---
There are also always people looking to fill out their raid groups, and MC will be ran all the time! Always a chance at an eye of rag drop lol
---
Bgs wont fix this. Que bg in thunderbluff and take  5 min to travel to DM. Que in under city run through plaguelands. Que anywhere hearth to kargath and hit brm. These 3 places will be camped forever on unbalanced servers. Considering alliance will avoid these places and horde will have 1-2 hour ques, they will spread out to the popular farm spots to search for allys. And considering blizz took no effort to prevent this catastrophe and appears to have no intention of promoting server balance anytime soon I imagine the imbalances will become more and more severe. Tons have quit already and I cant imagine many will stay when they realize how long the world will be unfarmable.
---
&gt; If I try to run an instance like BRD or UBRS. Ok, time to find a group. Barely any Horde on and if they do, they'll say fuck it to going to Blackrock. I miraculously find 4 other masochists to join me and proceed towards Death Mountain. Now let's all fly to Kargath, Thorium Point, or Burning Steppes. Immediately upon landing...yep you guessed it. Getting killed by 5-9+ alliance. Now it's the corpse hop to Death Mountain and we're at 45min - 1 hour since the group formed. One person decides to say fuck it and leaves the group causing the group to fall apart....a 5 MAN falls apart and the last hour has been for nothing.
---
&gt; This shit is unplayable and anyone defending it clearly is benefiting or so clearly in denial, regardless if it's Horde or Alliance. Not being able to play the actual game besides becoming another player's HK is beyond comprehension of why this hasn't been addressed.
---
I've had a different experience but perhaps Im on low pop server, so that might be the reason.
---
I hope so to. But the problem lies with the system itself.
---
Honor ranking is literally just grinding. And when you grind something, you want to take the path of least resistance
---
Fair fights will be avoided because it's a waste of time. Pre-mades will dodge other pre-mades to farm PUGs to oblivion. There will still be roaming gank squads engaging in unfair fights or camping chokes/flight paths.
---
The system rewards this sort of behaviour. It's just poorly designed. Coupled with the fact that only the "top" players get rewards means people are going to exploit every possible mechanic to stay ahead
---
I don't think there is much difference between 8 Spelldmg, 150 Mana and 8 spirit. Just pick what you feel you need most or what is cheapest.
---
People will be running everything that is in the game for the next couple years.
---
Do you start from the beginning for these Mara runs? If so, which side generally has the most herbs? Or do you Portal in and proceed from there? Thanks!
---
Why should I? According to Reddit etc my server is super horde favoured, and yet I spend every evening fighting large groups of alliance in Un'Goro and BRM. Both solo and in groups.
---
I take the portal and basically do a full circuit around the princess area then reset.
---
Thaddius was the one boss that was made alot Harder because of unstable servers and bad computers. The rest of the bosses there will not be a big difference.
---
I carry two stacks of ankhs for the same reason too lol. And I made a weakaura to yell at me when I have less than 4 in bag and at a city/rested area so I can stock up on more. I just wanna share it with all these ankh-less shaman I see.
---
Guess which class I've been clearing with since the fourth week, vs now. Hint: my guild had to stop recruiting healers.
---
Whisper back /spit for the lols
---
What about forceful transfer of several guilds or forceful change of their faction? Sounds just as fair but funnier.
---
You might be a bit late for phase 3 content and BWL but for phases 4-6 you have plenty of time to get to 60 and gear up.
---
So anyway, I start blasting! Please upvote
---
If you can only pvp 3vs1 maybe pvp isnt for you
---
Resto Druid here...
---
Fishing and cooking my friend...fishing and cooking all the time :D
---
A little bit of herbalism and dungeons but mostly..yep you guessed it right! fishing and cooking \^\^
---
Very true... Back in the days i spent hours to make my 19 rogue with the damn fishing hat, arena grandmaster etc.. one day i come back home and my sis proudly annouces that she leveled my rogue to be nice.
---
Never share your account boyz
---
Its unplayable on pretty much all Servers right now as Alliance. I just log in once per Week for MC/Ony. We gather in SW, pop a Ony Buff and then go into the Blackrock with ~75 People and kill everything on our way.
---
Blizzard built in rolling its oldest character wins I think (used to be in Wrath iirc). In pugs/master looters though? Just roll again.
---
Yes you are too late to the party. Smash your computer into pieces and start watching "days of our lives" series, late to the party also, but not as late as coming to Classic. Sorry.
---
I think they should do an experiment. Stop enforcing that rule for a week or two and see what happens. If the sub goes to shit, then bring the rule back. If not then it means it was unnecessary.
---
It's fantastic for leveling but that's about it
---
Yes exactly!
---
If you really like to suffer when playing. Undercity is amazing!
---
It's not running away, it's tactical repositioning :D
---
Pretty much anyone who has played on private servers knew this was going to happen but people didn't listen
---
Reddit is pedantic because what you're saying is false.
---
PvP is player vs player , any action regarding to opposing factions killing each other will always be pvp.
---
It's not reddit fault that you cannot use the correct words, thats called communication.
---
Mage vs Rogue is pretty even with all CD up on both side right now.
---
pve server?

I just stealthed through RFD and kill the bosses, disenchant the blues for Small Radiant Shards and those can go for between 5-8g or so.

It's stupid for casters. Also the ''target closest enemy'' becomes ''target next ennemy'' ..  Bullshit

When you say hit capped you mean 9?

Still having trouble deciding an alt after getting my warrior to 60 and almost full prebis

I’d like to be able to farm gold to find my eventual Lionheart helm but either DPS or a healer - a class which would be useful to a raid/dungeons but also good at PvP

I'm on Dreadmist, there's a guy called muph who is always being rude in world chat and kinda just trolling. Funny sometimes I guess. But world chat is usually kinda slow so I guess it doesn't really matter

Two questions: when low on rage still BT?

Do you have handy addon for marks?

If they moo back are they giving consent?

Thank you for sharing the knowledge. :D Just reading this now and it really looks like you got attacked for stating something I didn't know.
---
"^^"
---
Should check some leeway videos, u will be surprised
---
You need a full stack of 60s with a mage to be guaranteed to clear that event IMO. Nothing can beat polymorph for CC really and consistently taking 1 Ogre out the fight is huge. Polymorph plus frost nova and counterspell really help control that fight.
---
You can do it without that but there's always a chance of a wipe them. Like you said, some bad Ogre spawns and you're toast.
---
If you have a few locks, clear MC one day and some other day go straight to rag with bags full of soulshards. Poor rag won't even know what hit him
---
Exactly. For everyone else having further questions or want to get some deeper into it:

There's nothing to understand, you said something stupid and I called you out on it. Pretending you meant something different is meaningless, you're reacting like a toddler if you think anybody would let you change your point after the fact, especially when you delivered it as an insult.

Don't express yourself like an idiot and you won't have this problem, "I'm actually not an idiot, I meant something different!" then don't write like one.
---
This guy is compaining about going into a contested territory where it's known people camp around waiting for people.
---
Ontop of that he went alone into this so ofc he is gonna die.
---
I and many others aren't that dumb that we don't see groups camping lowbies or ganking alot as frusterating, i just think those people complaining about their PVP server being too high pop as the problem or dominated by one faction when they have gotten chances to swap servers to a better one and had ample time to level to 60 and bring a group to help you get in without dying too much
---
I personnaly use the wowhead page on realm https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community

If you are thinking about moving to Dragonfang you should pop some questions in our discord server. The community is tight knit but there are always a few of the toxic ones (they ruin their reputation on the server pretty quickly). I think it’s a good idea to transfer if you aren’t enjoying the current server you are on but make sure to ask a few questions and find out if Dragonfang is actually the server for you.

Lmao ofc i have tried going in groups many times but it doesnt help when you get attacked by 10+ horde camping the entrance to Dire Maul
---
I had just gotten Brutality Blade last week and started to think "oh shit I forgot Vis'kag existed did I burn my BiS roll?"
---
Well glad to know I'll need both eventually.
---
&gt;it's not me who is at fault. It's the Alliance players 
---
I mean, both of you choose the easy way. No matter the faction, I wont the alliance players but both of you staying on purpose on the dominate side.
---
And he lost next duel, when warlock put his pet in a distance, why didnt say about this?
---
Well guild is not the problem. Neither are most of the people. But I still think it's kind of anonymous. And with many people you have many shit heads. I am also playing horse myself, so I have more of a problem being the one on the winner side and then again I don't like how quickly a 1v1 can become an unwanted 5v1 or what ever.
---
But I think the worst problem might be how contessed npcs, or farming areas might become. The whole world seems a little too crowded for me. And I'm just in the lvl 40s right now. Might become worse in 50s. With 60 I can't tell. Really don't know how much I will be outside then, as soon as leveling is done.
---
I would be fine with the population being halfed. Maybe even a greater reduce. But I don't know about it having like 2 or 3 raid groups. But I don't know how it looks on dragonfang
---
Most who played on private servers absolutely saw this coming. It's incredible that Blizzard didn't somehow pick up on it because it really should be apparent to everyone but those who haven't played since 2006.
---
I'm sad for those who rolled PvP thinking it would be like the good old days where ganking would obviously still happen a lot, but then realizing what sort of disgusting playstyle it brought on with all the knowledge we have now. 
---
I personally never enjoyed wPvP at all, always found it to be annoying and not worth my time at all. I tried convincing my friends to play on PvE but they were having none of it, so my warnings went unheeded, and now I'm here all by myself because they all quit in less than two days after P2 launched - despite being Horde on a balanced server. It is that much of disastrous shitshow. 
---
And to think it could have been either totally prevented or at least mitigated significantly by simply listening to someone who apparently understands the human psyche and game design better than a board of designers and developers.
---
faction queue is a terrible idea. People who thinks that's the way to balance realm pop have not really thought it through what the queue would look like if they try to whittle 80% horde pop servers down to 20%.
---
The post can be read as, "I between the timam un happy about the discrepency between the time that a quest was turned in and the time that the reward buff was given." On the internet, the discrepency between an action and the time of the response is known as lag.
---
Spell queuing.  If you click a spell or ability about half a second before the current one finishes then it'll queue your spell and cast it as soon as it finishes the current one.
---
They added this in Wrath I believe. Pretty big change that I rarely see mentioned around here.
---
&gt;memes are just inside jokes but for the internet.
---
More like inside jokes for people whose entire lexicon is quotes from a tv show.
---
It's not 2009 anymore. Grandmas post them on Facebook. Memes aren't some special sub culture anymore.
---
I would definitely be up for this. My server was one of the "dead" servers that got free transfers from faerlina and the like, and what used to be a fairly close to perfect 50/50 is now closer to a 60/40 alliance favored. Real issue is the server is pretty new comparatively, so none of our horde guilds are established enough to compete with the mass influx of nearly full BiS raid geared alliance with nothing left in the game to do than world pvp, many of which whom also are coming from an extremely toxic experience themselves. We are losing horde pop exponentially now because of it. Real shame, we had this oasis of casual and balanced pvp only for the flood gates to be opened before any faction imbalance preventatives were put in place. 
---
If I could sign up to be guaranteed a 50/50 split I would do it in a heartbeat. Likewise, if I could join a server with vanilla pop cap, I would.
---
A lot of people are petty and vindictive, especially when emotionally struck. The famous "You think you do but you don't" moment was a big embarrassment to the person and the team and I'm sure they will never forget it. I don't think they explicitly want classic to fail, but I'm sure there is some semblance of ego defense wanting to justify the statement and drive people to retail instead. Plus the fact that retail is more profitable with extra micro-transactions. The simplest example of this is how much advertisement/attention blizzard is giving to retail opposed to classic, for example at blizzcon.
---
&gt; However, what i think is reasonable to expect is that you eventually observe something closer to the regional/global ratio, which last I checked is something like 60:40ish. 
---
If that would be the result, it's still very far from 50:50 and it still is no guarantee it will end up like that.   
---
&gt; Prior to this transfer, your server literally had less than 2500 raiding players *all time*. I’m sorry, but it is good for your server to continue to grow. Your players enjoy a small server, I understand that. However, I’ve seen your economies—both factions. The Horde *will* benefit from this Alliance growth. Look at the bright side, you now have more people to hunt for honor. Do you know how bad it feels to be looking for PvP on a server where your faction is significantly larger? Really bad. It’s really boring. Constant /who to try and find the few parties PVPing. You chose to transfer to a server that would clearly continue to have open transfer. You can’t complain when players exercise the same right that you did. There are overwhelmingly more horde in the potential transfer pool than alliance. Chill out and let the system find its equilibrium. 
---
If you enjoy playing on a server with big or small population is not really up to you to decide. Sure, there are some good benefits with like that you'll find a group for dungeons much easier, but you will never see a Black Lotus on a high pop server unless you are extremely lucky or you camp them. Point is, if OP enjoys a low/medium pop server it's not up to you to decide that it'll be better with more people joining, especially if it will fuck up the faction ratio like it seems it has done.
---
I'm not whining. When I got into the 50-60 range, in PUG there were more a-holes than when I was leveling. And some left groups after one wipe. 
---
I'm seriously not complaining and whining. I suck it up and move on.
---
There were just more nice people while leveling. Not saying there aren't any nice people there either.
---
dps feels fine, tho i got myself an Obsidian Edged Blade so i roll with what i have
---
As for arms pvp - i never dps'ed in one so no answer here
---
It's called the Lyceum in game but it is also known as torch room
---
As a raiding Boomkin, you will be stacking +arcane (Starfire).
---
Not +nature...
---
Yes forcing 3/4 of the horde to transfer or stuck in an eternal queue won't have severe consequences
---
Oh boy, now I dont need to hurt myself! UC got my back!
---
Is that not exactly what Blizzards response was? I thought theyre releasing WSG December 10th, sooner than initially planned...
---
Yup....I had completely forgotten until I got my Shammy up to ZF that  your old totems will aggro respawned pats.  There were a lot of instances I went through where hordes of mobs would come at my group from out of no where.  We would all think, "Damn instance aggro glitch!"  Nope, it was you Sham-boi forgetting to to activate the totems in new locations lol.  I just got my Sham to lvl 52, and I am taking extra special care when placing my totems.
---
I think I don't have a problem with toxic people. So this doesn't make a bad reputation for me. What does is, of the majority is toxic. But thought this to be a smaller issue on smaller servers.
---
For all the terrible things resilience did to the game, the one thing I liked about it was it was a pvp stat for pvp gear.  In TBC I never used PvP gear for PvE because despite always making it over 2k rating I always had better PvE gear from PvE.  Vanilla PvP gear was always a step behind PvE gear in vanilla and that's the reason they buffed it later, before once again being obliterated by naxx gear.
---
Ranking should be for prestige/fun and gear should be a side benefit for people not getting gear otherwise.  Incorporating BiS PvE gear from PvP is just a bad decision and its compounded by as you say the amount of time you have to invest.  But it was blizzards choice and this is what we get so *shrug*.
---
That has got to be one of the most shallow reasons people come up with. Also you know undead are just dead humans right?
---
Those "text overlay" type of posts should be removed. If they aren't, it's because we missed them or made a mistake in moderating.
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
6 weeks in our guild hasn't seen a single binding, and we get a blaster shot rifle every week.  Every mage has finally gotten a single piece of loot, while we have several 8/8 shaman.
---
RNG please
---
So record it then
---
You will struggle to find groups as a Rogue, no doubt. Let's look at the reasons why:
---
* Overpopulated, it's by far the most common DPS that are LFM dungeons, at least on my realm.
---
* No AoE - most people will not even consider a second Rogue for dungeons for this reason.
---
* Gear-sharing. If the dungeon is formed by a Warrior or Hunter, you're probably gonna get passed over. Not to mention most dungeon tanks are actually DPS Warriors that tank purely for grouping speed; they will see a Rogue and dip to use their much-needed role to get a group without the competition.
---
Even for semi-guild/pug raids, "no more Rogues" is extremely a very common sight.
---
People will say "make your own groups". This isn't a solution and will not help. People will not join a group that consists of just a Rogue, because there are dozens of other "LFM" which are also just a Rogue. Eventually you will find 2 other DPS, and then you'll be group # 200 spamming "lf tank and healer strat ud". If you do not have friends, you will sometimes spend all evening LFG and never find a group. It's not even easy to make friends as a Rogue, because many people assume you are just trying to use them for dungeon queues.
---
Mage has it much easier. They are excellent in speeding up dungeons and making them smoother on accounts of their AoE. Often you will see people, including me (Hunter), who specifically ask for a Mage/Lock for dungeons. Generally speaking, you don't get turned away from dungeons as a Mage, and the cyan colour of a Mage is prime-rib in the wall of whispers someone gets when they say "LF DPS xyz dungeon". There's a lot of loot competition in raids, but people always want more ranged DPS so at least you won't struggle to find a spot.
---
If you want to play the game, play a Mage. If you want to play on your own or an LFG simulator, pick Rogue.
---
very much, you could get gy camped, but not like it is now. classic is not like vanilla, the game might be as close as it could be made, but we the players are vastly different
---
According to census Firemaw is 55/45 horde favored. That is about as equal as it gets, especially when you factor in that Firemaw-Ally has Progress which routinely cleans out any Horde grps camping FPs. Alliance on Firemaw has also held BRM for the last 3 days except for nighttime, and it's essentially just a switch back-and-forth.
---
Horde camps Ally FP in Burning Steppes and Alliance camps Horde FP in Burning Steppes, Tarren Mill is just a huge back-and-forth, Winterspring switches hands every fucking hour, Felwood is generally Horde favoured due to a more centralized FP, and a closer main city. EPL is the only zone I can say which is almost exlusively a Horde zerg-fest, presumably because Progress rarely bothers showing up there.
---
Firemaw is awesome and the population is as equal as you can get. It's slightly horde favoured, but not enough to where Horde owns every hub in the game.
---
I can't decide whether OEB is a gift or a curse. It's an epic weapon, but it's worse than epics from Rag. But epics from Rag are worse than BWL so it would make sense OEB-&gt;no rag wep-&gt;BWL wep. But then again I have loot council so no loot for me anyway :P
---
Maybe if you all spent less time fappin and more time killin the mage you wouldn't be dying.  Just a thought...you do you tho boo.
---
damn is he a prophet? That was exactly what happened. Like to the every single detail
---
I had the same experience, i took Tyler the creators twitter post about cyber bullying and added in some wow refrences and it got instant deleted and locked. Then shit like this comes up and no one does anything:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e232p0/warrior\_vs\_mage\_matchup/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e232p0/warrior_vs_mage_matchup/) VERY FUNNY GOOGLE MEME HAHAHAAAA
---
Most warriors use a hit bow so there's not much room to change for pve. It is amazing for pvp though I can't blame people for dumping dkp on a pvp item.
---
Wait, we have Death Knight npcs? ^/s
---
warriors always seemed very appealing to me. i can imagine tanking with warr at least until 60, but istn warr overall by far the most played class on all servers?
---
You actually can if I'm not mistaken. Haven't done it in a while, but if you right-click and hold you can see where you're going before you release the click. If you don't like it, move the mouse off the portal and release. It doesn't get clicked
---
Are you sure? I checked videos and it seems pretty easy. Waterboy + Sacrificeguy are just pillar LOS and the last boss you only have to bring to 50% and then reset fight to get to veins without problems (not killing him). I am just worried that the Arcane Crystals become worthless
---
There's not reason not to do it if you want to know what it's about. I had a hard time getting into the mindset of it but know I'm ok with it.
---
Basically all you can do on a pvp realm as outdoor activity is pvpn if you want to do anything else you'll have to suffer through pvp interaction. Wants to famr / quest / dungeon /travel / explore ? be prepare to die X amount of time to do it. The safest activity right now is to farm people doing these things
---
In the actual 1.12 vanilla client you couldn't - but in classic you can.
---
i'm pretty sure you can't keep a subreddit discussing a 15 year old game interesting without allowing memes
---
I find that UC has the easiest layout of all the capitals (Ally included).  It's amazingly easy to navigate and find stuff once you get the hang of it...
---
Because it's a "young well dressed" character fucking you in the ass. It is literally the best name for low level wow twinks there is.
---
Hm, I will think about that! My Hunter alt is currently 20, but DM North seems very stressful..
---
Faction queues might help on some realms, but I play on fairly balanced realm, horde still dominates most zones because alliance chills in IF or dungeons like bunch of pussies
---
In what ways did boss mods do this? I'm curious but can't think of anything that would be helpful with just friendly nameplates. I never have mine on anyways since I just use party/raid frames instead.
---
I'm was on a "dead" server. Until a bunch of alliance guilds decided they don't like the fullest German server and transfer to us. 
---
Now I'm farmed by alliance scum. 
---
Guess I'm playing something else now.
---
I'm not tracking the exact gph but it actually averages around 60g per hour per Person. I think people are exaggerating on gph a LOT or tend to wrong time estimations. Even hitting the 50 gph mark needs a lot of min-maxing already. We got set routes on who takes which path, checks which book spawns, loots warpwoods and exactly when to use which ability. 
---
This INCLUDES crystals but excludes books. Crystals go for 50g on my server and we get on average one per hour. 
---
So, excluding those would result in 35 gph per person. Thats with me being enchanter and disenchanting anything that vendors for less than 2g cause thats what the shards sell for.
---
Books except for Foror are completely worthless on my server. I got Foror only once so far from Alzzin which sold for 550g. Not a single one from the ground. Might just be unlucky since someone else told me he already got four. 
---
We did not sell bops at all because we figured the outcome was too minimal for the effort. Also high chance of people not knowing where to go, what to do and possibly dying or even wiping you from time to time which would result in less gph. That said, selling bops is optimal if you are not able to 2-men this yet.
---
What should you play?  Well if you’re alliance right now I would suggest you go play another game because this game is garbo.
---
Don't BT sunder should do same threat if not more. 
---
If you have tactical mastery you have a second taunt with mocking blow
---
Mark a skull, let dps focus it, Taunt it at 50%, till then just sunder all the other mobs and keep revenge on CD
---
And always stay in defensive stance for threat boost.
---
You arent parrying raid bosses.
---
Costs a lot of points that the last 3 of which can be better spent
---
Are you saying druids use more than maul/swipe while tanking and more than healing touch when healing?
---
There is actual flavor though. They are hunched over and decaying. Tauren are giant humanoid bulls. Orc are muscular green humanoids with fangs. Trolls are lanky blue humanoids with tusks. 
---
Nothing you say can change my mind. Why don’t you go back to getting killed in south shore alliance nerd
---
in real world pvp mages have consumables too and there just isn't a way for you to win if they pop an invul potion.
---
Apples and oranges.
---
Nobody will believe me, but here goes.
---
In 2007ish, I once had to go afk for a really unimportant reason during a dungeon.  I told my group "cat on fire,  must extinguish". 
---
The group lold I did my thing, no big deal.
---
Since returning to classic, I've had 2 other people go afk in different groups, both of whom used the cat on fire excuse. 
---
In my mind, I invented a popular thing. And there is no way to get credit :/
---
DM is more stressful as a warlock, trust me. You also need the right spec as a warlock and as someone mentioned above, good gear, ideally 400 ish spell power but the gear requirements not even close to being as strict for a hunter. You also need mining to really push the gold/hour up. 
---
I stuck with herbing and Mara runs for my gold as I simply don't have the time to level a hunter alt for grinding.
---
From my personal experience, yes dungeons can be hard to find at times but the questing and levelling experience was sublime not having to fight over mobs. I’m now in full bis with six or so epics so it’s not impossible. I’m an adult with a full time job and responsibilities so not having hundreds of people to contend with was a necessity. It’s not all roses mind, the AH isn’t as active which came as a shock and as mentioned above tanks are gold dust. Luckily I landed a raid spot in one of the top horde guilds on the server so my experience might be slightly tainted but coming at 44 from golemagg was one of the best moves I made. 
---
Remember though, there’s no going back so any community you’ve made will be left behind. You might feel a bit lonely to begin with but there are decent people out there who are more than willing to help.
---
&gt;some guy that finally dinged 20 after 2 months with 5 kids and a wife.
---
You cut me deep, bro
---
Like I’ve said. Just post any questions you have in the discord and get to know a few people. It will be the best way to find out what the server is like.
---
*cries in alliance dominated server*
---
Containing potassium benzoate.
---
So basically nobody shouldnt attack you because you want to have it your way and only on your terms?
---
As a note, we allow advertisements for other subreddits, forums, websites, etc roughly once every 30 days or so, so this post is fine to be recreated once a month. I'd encourage you to improve the post as being more than just a title + link, but maybe go into details with a text post that explains why your subreddit is worth people looking into it.
---
The stam + spirit alone is reason enough for a paladin to get it
---
The Warlock was being a crybaby
---
i don’t have to change your mind, I am merely pointing out that your reason is pretty weak. 
---
Also who still fights at south Shore?
---
My main is a rogue and I need to earn some cash. I have been doing BRD pickpocket runs, but those are a little slow, I feel.
---
If I should level an alt to make money, which should I make? I both want to make money in this phase, but also the future phases.
---
its low level instances so just need if its an upgrade, dont worry about anyone else.
---
Maybe the Alliance races suck beyond their racials.
---
- Human
---
- Short human
---
- Shorter human
---
- Long purple human
---
Go ahead and roll your eyes at me. You're wrong. 
---
This is absolutely what you sign up for. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
Getting camped is part of PvP server life. If you can't handle it, you should have rolled on a PvE server.
---
If you can't figure out how to counter this situation, then you deserve to be farmed.
---
Sounds like a malfunctioning addon?
---
Yeah but doesnt mean past 9 hit is useless or bad.
---
Well, the videos all show when it goes well, not how much can go wrong. A lot of rng with enslaves breaking early, resists, sometimes the hellcaller pack by waterboy aggroes for literally no reason. But yes the hardest part is Zalvinn if you want to kill him (which I do, for books).
---
Mages are infamous for their ability to AoE farm pretty much everything short of MC trash.
---
Hunters can solo DM tribute runs.  [https://www.twitch.tv/zeroji](https://www.twitch.tv/zeroji)  does it for fun, with nice relaxing music.
---
We all know  there are execeptions, hence the use of average.
---
I hate to break it to you:
---
Undead: Grey humanoid   
---
Troll: Blue humanoid  
---
Orc: Green humanoid  
---
Tauren: Cow humanoid. 
---
Wow humans are gorilla like beast men with ridiculously long arms. Night Elves are Amazon giants with absurd muscle to waist size ratios, etc. No matter what you’re not playing a lifelike human, but all races are humanoids.
---
Could you just make and require appropriate flairs, then people can filter memes and shitposts from their feed? I've seen it on other subs and I liked the concept, because I could also search by flair knowing every post requires one, and I'll catch all the results.
---
i got lucky and got mine for low DKP, i wanted this one to avoid farming dal rends..also im undead without edgemasters; if lucky with procs i can reach dw wars with oni axe :) feels good
---
This just means the three people above you did not want to suicide for the neck.
---
How good is rogue shadowcraft 6/8 combined with 2/2 devilsaur set compared to pre-raid BiS?
---
I'm currently missing some key preraid BiS items like Mask of the Unforgiven and truestrike shoulders. I noticed if I swap out some gear for shadowcraft pieces I get 2% crit (but lose 2% hit) and also like 40 attack power.
---
Would it be worth it to focus on scholomance for the last shadowcraft piece I need or instead try to go the other preraid BiS items?
---
You should probably have gotten over that by now dog. He didnt rape and murder your family, he kicked you. It's actually not that devastating.. it's been 15 years..
---
Dragonfang can be awesome at times, like the other poster said definitely join the Discord server and ask around. We recently had a guild of 100+ members transfer over from Gandling and they love the change, the place is way more tight-knit and feels like an actual community.
---
I'm in your guild!
---
You should absolutely make it so that people who do not sign up for raids have their rank frozen for the raids they're not attending. Otherwise the guy that raids once a month will be guaranteed loot every raid, while the guy who attends each raid is getting punished. 
---
I also believe that it shouldn't be left to the individual whether they're suiciding or not. By making it mandatory to suicide for every upgrade you get rid of people hoarding ranks for the big upgrades, though this might not go over well depending on the guild.
---
Why don't you use Shield Block? I'm a newer tank and all the guides I've read suggest spamming SB, Revenge, Sunder, in that order. It's worked very well for me so far but I'm always looking to improve.
---
Isn't that how competition works?
---
Throw out some gang signs. What guild + faction. I’m curious. 
---
From an alliance nerd,
---
&lt;Skyclad&gt; Vaneesh
---
Alliance always take /spit more seriously I've found, and thinking spitting on someone when they die means something other than an expression of their own rage.
---
lol, I tried that for all of 10 minutes, where I spent 8 of them dead. That was just to get to an area where there wasn't 10+ people.
---
I'll just wait til BG's and hope that my memory of that isn't sullied as well.
---
As per the rules of the subreddit and in the interest of continually taking place in discussions on this board I think I will refrain from doing that.
---
Thanks for a detailted reply man. I'm farming it hard for sulfuron ingots, they are fucking 800g on my serv and crystals 30g. 50Gph and 1 crystal per hour sounds about right, but i did 50 runs so far and sold 1 foror for 750. One for a few hundred runs is a bit unlucky.
---
The how is very easy if you know a bit about computers.   
---
Making the code is by far the hardest part.
---
Spawn/Rez pet, Mend pet, Set to auto attack are all comps easy to trigger with a clicker.  
---
Then you need to be able to move toward a direction (read direction, read position, input rotation, input move forward)  
---
Then then need to be able to spawn : Read your position and your dead body position through API or Memory
---
Finding what you need to do took me 1 minute.  
---
Finding how to do that and making the code behind it will probably take a few hours to a few days depending on experience and skill of the developer.
---
I could probably make one but it doesn't feel that rewarding.  
---
Making an AI that would roleplay through the game (including talking to other players with roleplay) would be far more fun to do.
---
The last bit is expensive, and absolutely pointless if you're not going to craft lionhearts and stuff.
---
I only see this in guild runs. I normally don't mind but it's annoying sometimes. It's also rare. I assume she's just being an attention whore to insist on VC.
---
But it shouldnt outperform the preraid bis list right?
---
Yes, my post was made to illustrate the difficulties of the dungeon and encourage reading up or watching a guide before blindly going in there, if he's not on a 57 alt. The place is a breeze with a guild group or good pug, but I've been to one or two pugs where it's been a complete mess.
---

---
Consensus seems to be, that 6 Shadow + 2 Devilsaur is great. BUT, it's harder to upgrade your items since breaking the 6 Shadow set bonus sucks.
---
The first one is something I want to bring up with my raid leader but I'm not the most important person in the guild so I don't want to overstep.
---
For example the caster at the top of our list today passed on Staff of Dominance to hold out for Mageblade. Do you think that shouldn't be allowed? (even with the AV rewards coming out in December)
---
We’ve tried nothing, and we’re all out of ideas!
---
In those cases I am... let's say "not so nice".
---
And I am a "I told you so" guy.
---
Problem is: if I tell somebody I am right most of the time.
---
So my question for you is: Why do people hate the "I told you so" guy even more than the guy who messed up?
---
And this is not just in the game, in every field if you tell people in advance that they are doing bollocks and then afterwards remind them you are somehow the bad guy.
---
Why is this?
---
few months ago they sold all the props to collectors (Adam Savage bought like 40% of all props). Also Legendary lost the brand with it and only chinese market accepted it great.
---
I dont. That's what is driving me crazy. My first post says it should go to rogues and warriors first, for the exact reasons you mention. I go on to explain that despite being bis for hunters, which they are, it's obviously going to do more good with the melee, and therefor my guild won't let hunters roll until melee are done. 
---
All that being said, bis is bis. And just because a rogue will do more with it, doesn't mean it's not hunter bis. That's all I said. And then you told me to be kind as if stating a fact was somehow hurting someone. Which to me was extremely ridiculous.
---
of course you will. loads of folk still leveling or on their 2nd / 3rd alts now. Still see loads of groups required at all levels.
---
Ya they are full of shit honestly, they are just being lazy. Blizzards new version of cs is an abomination and idk why they even charge $15 a month if it’s not going to cs or servers at all.
---
Oh yeah, because *everyone* is going to be doing world PvP while they're queuing...
---
do i not talk enough to not have noticed this issue before ... Morgraine EU
---
&gt;an horde on a less horde favored server
---
Sure, tell me how i could know which one was less horde favored at launch. Or a bit after launch since i think my server started like one or two days after.
---
For a caster that can dish out strong damage and provide offheals/support when needed, is Ele/Resto Shaman superior to Balance/Resto Druid? I know Druid can tank and stealth which is very appealing but the damage of Elemental Shaman seems much stronger.
---
i don't get why people want everything in tv series, just make it a 2 part film instead of making it 10 season show. There's never gonna be another game of thrones ever again
---
Its definitely funner than being camped. Rank grind even with bgs is zzz they dont care if they bored, its progression for them.
---
Now I’m googling SPY addon
---
Thanks for the positivity!! We need more people like you on Reddit.
---
Edgy!
---
There are still a couple of well moderated subreddits out there!
---
Would like to know this anf also how it really affects ranking. I play when I can, no fix hour.
---
The real way to roll ony bags is just have the leader roll 1-(number of players) and give it to the person whose number in the raid correlates with the roll. No more spam
---
Made me lol
---
Calculate bracket sizes at the end of the week, then ask someone on the opposite faction to do the same. That's going to be as accurate as it gets, since you don't really care about the players not involved in PVP at all (as you never encounter them outdoors).
---
I said reroll yet, not months ago.
---
Are you trying to prove something ?
---
Well if 40% of your damage is white, and 40% of that is glancing, and the weapon skill is a 4% increase in glancing, then that's a 0.64% increase in damage. The added hit from the extra weapon skill only increases our white hits by 1%, which is a total increase of 0.4. which when added to 0.64 is a 1.04% increase in damage. One crit is a 1.2% increase in damage, so when you consider the added AP, CHT is waaay better than distracting dagger.
---
This is perfect! Feelsbad for the rogue but he should know his target’s abilities. Good job!
---
It's better than prebis but you break ti super easily, and when you do break it, you want to have the indiviual prebis pieces ready to replace the shadowcraft.
---
I play shaman at 60. Trust me, you don’t have to worry about running away, because you can’t. You only have a stub if you’re Tauren (1.5 seconds), you have a 50% slow, and damage. When you get jumped you either blow them up and make them regret it, or you die.
---
does this work when you have an alt in your group to reset amd you have to log out?
---
They’re both “battle elixirs” and as such do not stack although technically  both can be used at the same time. Try it for yourself. You’ll get the 2% crit and 25 Agi from Mongoose, but the greater agility Elixir will not give you any additional agility. You only get 25 from using both.
---
dueling tournament have different rules than real wpvping. e.g warriors in these tournament have uncontested opener aka always have their charge go off first
---
druids need the head :(
---
Tbh if you dont know SPY by now, you are living abit under a rock mate. Its the most controversial mod classic has, sparking massive discussions all over.
---
So I've been leveling an alt on a pve server, and you bet I fight every remotely killable alliance that's flagged. If they aren't flagged I'll often /spit or /rude. Started running into stonetalon one day. Then a 30 something Humaj Warrior (was ?? To me) joins on the path right next to me. Of course we're /spit /rude and such as we're running, but it's a long ass run. He does /growl, and I /cower in response. Then we just kinda hop and BS on our way up the path. It's weird that we form a sort of comraderie as we trek together through stonetalon, even though we couldn't speak any words to each other. 
---
Well we come to the fork in the road and go our separate ways, and he does /wave and /bye, and I follow suit. Hold up! I run back behind him with /wait to get him to stop. So he does and turns around. I /bow, and he returns it.
---
Then I hit him with the /rude and jump away into the night. I hope he was laughing as hard as I was.
---
They answer. Look at all these ninjas being banned, people being asked to go down from roofs using griefing PvP. They even answered to me when I tried to switch my Ony head reward, and it wasn't an automatic answer.
---
Don't spread bullshits.
---
Wow you both are awful.
---
Everybody and their mother who is ranking will do. Have to do so, because in order to rank up,  you have to beat your own faction!
---
I don't think I'm the right person to ask this to be honest. I'm a die hard believer in the Loot Council system as the only thing I care about is loot going to where it is the biggest upgrade. I don't see loot as a reward. 
---
I don't think you should hesitate to contact your raid leader, bringing up concerns is not overstepping your bounds. Just as your officers have expectations of you, you should have expectations of them, and listening to feedback from your members is essential. (Obviously, if you're still trialing, don't go in expecting them to change everything based on your opinion).
---
Why have so many bag slots unlocked?  There’s a free backpack on every bank alt
---
Why does it matter? If they don't need anything else, no reason to be there. Is it because of the way he asked?
---
I pretty much do live under a rock. I play solo without a guild and usually turn the chat window off
---
All threads about this addon made me download it as well. 
---
Lo and behold, mere days after Blizzard broke (or changed) the combat log functionality to try and reduce the effect of Spy - seems the squeaky wheel does get the oil.
---
Also screwed up DPS/Healing meters on Onyxia completely, since people are too far away for addons to interact with the other side's combat logs. Granted she's just one boss and a relatively killable grumpy dragon, but there'll probably be other fights where this same issue arises - but not having raided actively in vanilla, I don't know for certain. Feels like when Blizzard made changes that butchered some classes in PvE to accommodate people who whined about Arena, but this time it hit meters rather than classes directly.
---
At this stage of vanilla there were no Oceanic servers so I was playing on 250 ping. Pretty sure that has an impact.
---
nope. 1xBT gives more threat than 2xsunder. my observations of course
---
Okay cool that is what I have been doing, the cancel casting thing If I don’t need it, but preemptively healing on the tank .. I do not have very much spell gear at this point at all, I’m still working to get the staff from zf .. I should have put my points into resto first probably but I solo a lot in the world :/ thanks so much for the advice I have a way better understanding now of how people can manage to use such low rank spells. I’ve been stacking int like crazy, adlfraid to lose my big mana pool, but it seems it’s okay as long as I find good plus heal gear

no. you are not worth any more effort.
---
since it blocks only 1 attack for 10 rage.
---
no =)
---
had full mana when I posted this... you’re right
---
Well no one will reroll with close to one thousands hour on a serv, why would i go through that just for balance sake. If blizzard wanted to have balanced server they should have taken steps to do so.
---
I just don't see why you expect people to reroll just so the other faction doesn't get screwed over, it's not the dominant faction fault that things are this way.
---
I think you're missing the point of this post.
---
Get a grip man.  Why do you think I am "pretending to say something different?"  You sound like a psycho.  The chat is still there for anyone to read.  Again I'm sorry you didn't understand it.  
---
&gt;you're reacting like a toddler if you think anybody would let you change your point 
---
I'm dying laughing at a comment like this.  I'm not changing a point, you *still* don't understand it.  Do you have a serious reading comprehension failure?  Here's a little tip for you, when you are reading a paragraph, the author sets the meaning, not the reader.  You probably think Harry Potter is real.
---
&gt;Lmao if you're not literally 11 yo then that's so fucking embarrassing for you that you tried that, 
---
You have an 11 yr old brain and these repeated comments prove that.  
---
&gt;Don't express yourself like an idiot and you won't have this problem, "I'm actually not an idiot, I meant something different!" then don't write like one. 
---
The irony here is telling, but then again, that's the issue of this whole thing, your inability to understand irony or sarcasm.  Again, please leave me alone hobo.  I don't have any more change for you.
---
it's like 250g on my server
---
I actually miss the levelling experience of joining random groups who all just want xp, i think im going to level some alts, on a pve realm of course :P
---
hunter, warlock or mage. all are great at gold farming. pick the one you like the most to play.
---
I've found that levelling my alt rogue is just more gph than trying to farm anything as a dw fury since I need the +hit gear to kill anything but then I can't equip armor that would be good for pvp
---
Spy barely does anything after the nerf i feel like
---
A class in between a warrior and a Paladin... i think you are describing a feral druid :) especially as you want to play solo a lot, i think that would be a great choice for you
---
WAY more people agree with you. You have an Orc, a Troll, a Minotaur, an Undead. All different looking from one another with amazing racials.
---
On Alliance you have a human, a short human, a shorter human, and a purple elf.
---
Exactly! I was beginning to wonder why I had so much trouble making money the first time I played back in 2004. I couldn’t understand how people could afford anything.
---
Because it's not helpful.
---
"I told you so" doesn't help anyone and seemingly only is said so that people know you were right and the other person was wrong. No one's better off when you say it. The best case scenario is that nobody cares. The common scenario is that one person feels bad so you can feel superior. It's seen as incredibly selfish.
---
What server was this on?
---
But not all shaman throw totems down when they shouldn't. Or at all.
---
Literally?
---
Love you too man. People are probably reading this thinking wtf is going on
---
I don't play other games and i dont have a life
---
&gt; The 'informed' players today are probably around 75/80%+ of the player base.
---
Yea. Back in the day if someone had Engineering and carried an assortment of grenades, free action pots, etc., then they were considered going above and beyond for PVP. Now its expected because everyone knows about these things, and not having them is just gimping yourself. It kind of sours the experience when the cool things you used to do to get a leg up are just the modern standard.
---
Why can't I find anyone with Superior Strike enchant? Where does this enchant drop if I wanted to grind for it?
---
People will cry even more about battlegrounds, you just wait lol
---
Boomkins are memed on for being mana unefficient. Shamans are superior for healing and dps in terms of healing/damage done. Shamans also have a regular res and ankh (anti whipe).  As someone that mains a druid it is nice being able to do anything but your never the best chart wise except threat as a bear. Considering rolling a shaman alt. Theres benefits to both sides but from what you want it sounds like shaman would be better for you. 
---
I will say being able to roll HOTW NS on a druid essentially a dual healing and tank spec feels pretty good for joining and making groups .
---
Nice warrior loot
---
Having more money than is needed to earn fucking world hunger, would hopefully be enough money to have chat servers for 250.000 players.
---
When questing I often bring a full bag of extra arrows and go through them.
---
/thread
---
Or just pay the 1g mage tax and portal to Darnassus. I haven't been on an alliance boat since honour launched - it's not possible, economic or worth my time.
---
Really? I feel it has become a lot more usefull, beucase all the clutter is gone now.  
---
Now you only see people who are actually near you, and not way out of render distance, in some random direction.
---
I hope this sticks around
---
Congrats man, now if people would stop sending that other hunter death threats that would be great.
---
You don't need DPS meters when logs exist
---
Are there even any alliance dominated PvP servers?
---
Literally.
---
Yikes
---
Asking mods to turn over power to the community is like asking for China to allow for a vote on if they should keep censoring the internet. 
---
*Spoiler: they won’t.*
---
That was an arena change for TBC.  It isn’t in the patch classic is on, which is unfortunate.
---
Yea. I feel that Druid would be superior if I wanted to tank, but I'm more interested in playing a ranged caster/healer hybrid. I'll go with Shaman then.
---
Wait, aren't you unintentionally dissing yourself by saying that?
---
Welcome to life. Currently I’m studying for an exam to masters school, working full time, trying to keep up relationships, playing music, and at the same time trying to play wow classic. Because of these things, I’m only level 41 and I started early September, but I did take s month off. I find with classic it’s either classic and nothing else, or it’s no classic. You can’t half ass classic. It demands time to succeed. So I think when call of duty came out I let my sub expire and played cod for like 3 weeks or so, I’ve recently resubbed to play again over thanksgiving.
---
It's not required to raid on a Tuesday.
---
He needs to do damage, growl helps a little so definitely teach him that
---
You also need to regulate your own damage
---
ive been raiding MC since week 2 and still nee 9 items from MC to replace blues
---
Are you using growl?
---
Do you use the same PR person as Bobby Kotick?
---
I am in a guild that only raids on tuesdays and wednesdays which means i only have to play for those days. The good thing about classic is that you dont have to keep playing all the time to be up to date and since i have a 9-17 job it fits me really well that i know exactly when i have to raid. I know that tuesday and wednesday evening is for wow up untill usually 22:00 or 10pm in US time, but the rest of the days i can do whatever i want to and in the weekends i usually hang out with friends and dont play at all or just play a bit in the afternoon.
---
i'm new to warriors. i forget battle shout a lot lol
---
Redridge is definitely the way to go, it is, as i mentioned in another comment here, half the time of the deathruns from TP. Doesn't really take away the fact that no, BM is not Alliance held. It is on occasion when a raid comes through or a group of PvP'ers decide to do a cleanup, but if you spend a day running through there, you would see a very skewed ratio of hordes holding it down.
---
And the mount issue is a problem, as we don't all have epic mounts, some of us are busy farming gear rather than gold.
---
Lmao, you're right all anybody has to do is read it, and the downvotes speak for themselves. 
---
"No you are"  Right, kid. Fyi nobody will take you seriously while you're painting a fantasy that you're somehow superior despite being wrong, that's why you come off as so extremely childish and your attempts to be insulting just reinforce that, so good job.
---
Why can't we discuss a game play video? Guy yesterday posted a video of how to solo something as a mage. Lots of discussion happened.
---
They aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Using the term "sheep griefing" to refer to the mage helping a low level hunter who was clearly there first undercuts your false attempt at looking like a serious guild master. You deserve the shit reputation your guild has.
---
Thx for answer! Fury prot seems to be specific build with specific requirements - and overhyped - i dont go that way for now; time to set up my marks i guess
---
but they are spending it ... executive bonuses, holidays etc
---
F that. Ppl gonna know full well I did it to avoid a wipe. I’m not paying for your stupidity if I don’t have to
---
Nothing in this game is like Vanilla. We have too much knowledge and ways to optimize (min maxing) every single aspect. And if it is possible there is people who do it. They don't care about people who want to take casual approach. They are just merciless and will make every single thing to perform on the best level possible.
---
In original Vanilla we were just bunch of apes learning to make fire and using stone tools. Now we are modern humans with super fast cars and knowledge to send ourselves to the moon.
---
Classic is not bad game. But Classic will never be 2005 Vanilla.
---
Funny you mention that.  One of the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/ekoqayc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) basically says "Oh, it won't be all that bad since they won't have the huge private server populations, they'll have vanilla 3k populations".
---
Faction specific queuing would solve this. 50% of server cap allowed to be alliance, 50% allowed to be horde. If your faction is overpopulated you get hit with the queue while the other faction can still log in.
---
Furry prot is perfect tool for raids for ST threat. Furry is not perfect for 5 ppl due to many reasons
---
lmao how tho
---
You cant.
---
AoEs that are hitting 0 targets though... Should be way simpler than actual WPvP
---
I have a ticket being investigated right now because my missing day is pretty much the equiv of hitting my next rank up as i was (what appears to be 98% to next rank)
---
BRD seemed like such a confusing maze. With as many times I've been there now I could do that place backwards and blindfolded.
---
Nature's grasp tho?
---
Can someone explain how the flurry axe proc works exactly? Will the extra proc for my mainhand or is it just an extra hit with the flurry axe?
---
Reminds me of my first uldaman while leveling. Our priser healer was being a little bitchy to the group. At the final boss while he was sitting and drinking i /spit on him. This triggered him so hard that he demanded that i either apologized or Got kicked from the group, otherwise he wouldnt heal. Everyone thought he was joking so we started the boss encounter only to find the healer still sitting in the corner. It ended up with him leaving the group because they refused to kick me, and I dont give into internet terrorism so I didnt apologize to him for emoting lol.
---
Like a third of the dudes my group kills show up in spy after they are dead.
---
Gold grind got a lot easier when i use the adult tactic of making more money and spending less
---
Tbh everything but that might have to do with the fact that I was 11 years old when classic launched
---
Play paladin if you want to play a support, warrior if you prefer leading the charge. Both are exceptional PVP classes.
---
Both are fine for solo queue BGs. Warrior will need raid gear
---
Somehow it still lags out. There's been a 40 man multiboxer spamming fireworks specifically to induce lag and it actually worked, no idea why.
---
You will be running into a lot of players in tour same boat. You will get fffed over by people who are raid geared when you sing 60 (probably prior to singing) but will also encounter a lot fresh 60’s as well.
---
Sure, the key items are:  
---
Helm of Narv  
---
Lei of Lilies  
---
Wildheart Gloves  
---
Dreadmist Leggings  
---
Devout Sandals  
---
Band of the Hierophant  
---
Shard of the Flame  
---
Lifestone  
---
and the other items are just green "Of Spirit" or "Of the Whale" items
---
It's always easy to say those things, once something doesn't work. Nobody notices that something works for years, once it fails everybody flames.
---
been trying for a week and got one answer for retail so idk where else to post
---
Just watched history of the world earlier. Such a piece of art.
---
I did some theory crafting and you certainly can take the disc ones without fucking yourself much at all
---
"No changes! Except for the ones the frankenstein private servers hacked together"
---
I propose we ban low effort posts like OP's.
---
I also propose we harvest their butthurt and tears.
---
Vanilla forces you to be social. NOT! Recently I've seen how it's open for abuse that I've never ever thought. Let me tell you are not late for;
---
Lots of low levels that put on follow to 60 mains, questing like they are rolling in retail. 0 help for group quests or ignoring your invite.
---
People solo farming low dungeons for their alts, nobody wants to do dungeons for loots.
---
I've rerolled to warrior in P2 to get spot for dungeons &amp; being social. What did I get? Salty people, lots of whispers for pointless cleaving farms, random party invites, like my only job is to tank random people's dungeon runs. 
---
People abuses mechanics and sells dungeon loot or gathers mats. A major hit to economy. *none of my business, do whatever you want*
---
Toxic people trying to respawn kill 0 xp bearing targets for hours.
---
Yep, you are not late to see these. But is this real vanilla experience? No. I've played whole vanilla content and this was not the thing that I've played. There is nothing for you to challenge. Game finishes after some point. Back in 2005, when we killed ZG Hakkar, it was the best thing that I've experienced in WoW history and it was unforgettable. I still remember the date/hour, where I was living, what I was wearing etc. Molten Core was a dream. Dwelling thru the cave corridors and watching fiery dogs were like watching a movie back then. Guild was doing 3 MC bosses per day because it was taking some time. BWL was impossible. People were discussing it for days. A dude was in a Nefarian run in internet cafe. More than 10 people were watching his screen like a movie, football match. Today? People cleaning whole Molten Core in a hour like they are doing UBRS. BWL 1st boss will be easier than finding a 3 key stones for UBRS.
---
**Sorry. Real vanilla experience my ass.**
---
I lived in the ass end of no where. Had satellite internet on the farm. Levelled 1-60 and raided with 2500ms ping back in the day.  Wasnt too bad as a warlock. Can just imagine my excitement when i moved to the big city and their fancy high speed.
---
And how old were you when you played vanilla? ;)
---
You forgot the rogue that goes stealth and waits till your mob is at 25% so he can kill you before you kill the mob and he takes the mob. 
---
Despite giving 0 honor.
---
It's literally the same discussion in this thread 100 times a day echoed ad nauseam. It's no different than memes, at least memes are usually light hearted and don't perpetuate this whole sky-is-falling bullshit rhetoric this sub has been since launch.
---
Looks about right.
---
I actually don't know where I put my glasses!
---
I thought about it alot, its not a joke (that was farily clear tbh) and it is exactly what you think it is:  
---
Auto kick people with spy.
---
Enemy cast bars require you to either be within 20 yards (for nameplates) or have them targeted, thats two things the SPY addons doesnt need. Spy will actually help you target, regardless of where people are around you.
---
Weakauras is just timers, which can be highly inaccurate, because of the way it reads the information. Its not exactly on the same level as SPY at all.
---
I did try it and it feels like an improvement tbh. You have way more accurate info on the SPY screen now, you know people are close when they pop up and it can still "see through walls".
---
Its ok that you dont agree, but i do mean what im writting. Im not trying to troll of make a joke here. Thats why i wrote "unpopular opinnion" in the title.
---
I’ve been doing good man!  Farming honor and killing dragons! Hope all is well with you guys!
---
Can anyone explain why I made a named a gouge macro “Oshit” (it cast gouge then a bandage) the icon on my hot bar shows the name on it. When I make the same exact macro for Blind the name I added to it does not show on the hot bar. I want the text as it helps me differentiate between a normal blind and an Oshit I need to bandaid blind.
---
Is it one or the other?
---
Generally you can catch them by surprise too since they're just used to mashing face into keyboard vs 1 player at a time. BG's are gonna be a rude wake up for a lot of the people that only succeed due to the numbers advantage.
---
Well, that explains why there are Horde up my ass everywhere I go.
---
Great idea. Upvote.
---
Major Mana will always be in high demand. Mongoose for melee as well
---
This is a great idea!
---
Come on in, only at Phase 2!
---
Word of warning, rolling a PvP server will be miles harder now than it was on release, so before you take that leap be sure you can handle the ganks as they WILL happen and happen a lot.
---
Farming hunters in Silithius is a honor paradise. First you kill the hunter, roam to the north killing people at elementals, then you go back and kill the underprepared guild group trying to defend him.
---
Yep mark basi as the skull though
---
Just make sure you go PVE. My biggest regret.
---
Did you instance farm at all on your hunter? If so, do you have a preference? I also have a druid main and am leveling a hunter for that ease of gph.
---
PvP servers in 2019 is nothing like PvP servers were in 2005. The toxic private server community made sure of that.
---
Roll an alt on the server and and scope it out for a few days.
---
It's not too late. I would definitely recommend researching individual servers in regard to their demographics however. Try Ironforge.pro for this. Alliance is getting outnumbered and ganked to hell on the majority of pvp servers but there are some relatively balanced servers still like golomagg (horde favoured) and ashbringer (alliance favoured) for example.
---
How much gold you avg. in Brd?
---
In the long run the other mange/hunter can make more gold but keep in mind that you have to level them first.
---
In what world did you express that point lmao
---
Only paid attention at the start of the game to the PvE server population, never really looked at it again lol
---
Solid logic there. Cant compute.
---
It does. Plenty of calculations done already. But it Requires the fights to be long (not a super geared raid) and the rogue to be active (and use the generated energy)
---
So should fury dps be allowed to roll on daggers vs rogues?
---
For "normal" elites in instances, shield block isn't that important. With multiple mobs hitting you, you'll usually get enough dodges/parries/blocks to proc revenge anyway.
---
Vs dungeon bosses, it's more important.  
---
It helps protect you from crushing blows.  
---
And if you only have one mob attacking, there's less incoming attacks to proc revenge.  
---
Using Shield Block will pretty much guarantee a revenge proc, and Shield Block + Revenge costs the same as Sunder (slightly more if you have improved Sunder).
---

---
Let the community decide what it wants this subreddit to be. Like, that is the point of reddit.
---
How is this possible! I thought it was just the evil horde endlessly slaughtering people.
---
How many times did you fail before you got good at this?
---
Not too late. People are making alts, if not joining. Consider these factors:
---
- server size - the ones labeled as full or high are grossly overpopulated. Find a server that is similar in size to the Vanilla servers,
---
- faction balance: the more populated the server is, the more apparent will be faction imbalance, up to a point of unplayability,
---
- pve vs PvP: servers with large populations might be very punishing to players who like to solo stuff.
---
For flurry axe
---
I spent 3 days farming honor in Blackrock. It was very much alliance held. Just /who Blackrock Mountain and you can judge by the amount of 60s in there who is holding it (outsideof raiding times)
---
But at what cost was it? To much if you ask me, and many others.   
---
It put a workload on the addon authors now, to fix things, because Blizz took the easy way out.
---
I would love this option too. I also do not wish to kill myself about it.
---
You can go through the post and figure it out yourself if you're that desperate to be a cunt to people over an opinion on a video game.
---
I have been playing alts to get general feed back but it doesnt compare to playing a max level toon and playing end game content regularly
---
This makes me unbelievably mad.  My server Kirtonos is ~60/40 H:A and even that makes the game so unfun.  This is coming from someone who played vanilla since '04 and played the hell out of it back then as well on a PvP server.  This doesn't feel like anything in Vanilla because *most* of the servers back then had pretty close H:A ratios.  
---
Earlier today I wanted to farm 4 Elemental Fire so I went to the only area which isn't constantly overrun by horde, Arathi Highlands.  I had to compete against a horde hunter who I killed and then watched as he didn't release his body.  I knew what was happening.  About 2 minutes later I was greeted by 2 horde mages who promptly blew me up in retaliation.  They weren't even in his same guild, just people in the area.  I did '/who Arathi' and got a list of a few alliance all sub 50, and a 60 who was just flying by.  
---
This is the experience you get right now on most PvP servers.  It sucks and BGs can't come soon enough.
---
Why are all these numbers so close? How can Trash Blade do only 30 dps less than Vis'Kag the Bloodletter when Vis'kag is almost 60% higher weapon dps?
---
You will never get TF as a Main Spec DPS Warr.
---
It is also wasted on ANy DPS except for a Rogue.
---
Ty. Appreciate it!

Transferred to earthfury weeks ago because of queue times - 5 days before honor is released - 50 million alliance all geared out transfer to server and camp every single area with large grps - 9 deaths to get inside ubRS last night and I can stealth - thanks blizz
---
Jesus that's hilarious.
---
I have thought about this as well. I don't really know what I average in BRD. But it is a nice point to consider. But I would also like an alt for other reasons too :)
---
Yeah man we are close to our second raid group! Having a great time.
---
Well im not really butthurt, I dont play on a pvp server, most of the time, because its not really what i want.
---
But i feel the effect of this combat log nerf, just as everyone else, because blizzard took the easy route and gimped the entire addon community, forcing a new workload on creators.
---
I believe that bliz system does a hidden reroll behind the screen on ties to decide who wins.
---
Doesn't sound like your game chief
---
As usual, wait for battlegrounds. It should take a hell of a lot of pressure off the world ganking when people actually have another option. Right now the absolute best way to get honor is camp flight masters in raids, that's just how the game goes.
---
Thats similar to faerline but reversed. Being the vast majority doesn't sound like much fun either
---
My god...
---
Dude, I already told you two times that someone with that much ig times spend wont reroll obviously, are you good or something ? 
---
Also if you spend that much time ig since the release you should consider take time for yourself also, that's an unhealthy about of time spent, even for a no-lifer.
---
&gt;I just don't see why you expect people to reroll just so the other faction doesn't get screwed over, it's not the dominant faction fault that things are this way.
---
I mean, if you don't see why the imbalance is toxic, I'm pretty worried about you once again. You hold that much to stay on easy mode, go on, nobody stops you from enjoying this.
---
the page is full of memes anyway why do you need more unfunny garbage filling up the page? memes are not funny 95% of the time.
---
I was also under the impression at the time that I would be Vanilla populations 😔
---
Bosses in 5ppl on 60 lvl do not crush. Only crit
---
Keep your warrior, team up with a healer, do Orb runs and reserve the first orb then round-robin (which even reserve haters like me are pretty OK with), respec arms for PvP.  Forget rolling another 60. You can easily make 100+ gold per week doing strath runs for your respec costs.
---
Share the love, for reference, I have it from the shaman discord server.
---
Hahaha yea, had to go thru 10 different definitions before I got to the mmo one
---
Then downvote and move on.

You're the one that said people just need to read what you said to see who is right, I'm just pointing out what happened when they did, dumbo. So cry me a river.

holy fk its him! reddit is the true end of the rainbow

Are you saying they should've kept there talents as they were at level 60 through expansions?
---
That makes sense, but what about the damage reduction from added block?  I'm guessing when your healer is well-geared it doesn't make much difference, but is it noticeable in 5 mans with a healer that is maybe under level 60 or not geared great?
---
It’s a bromance of massive proportions.
---
Ahhh a high quality meme, almost reminiscent of the great meme meta of summer '19 during the last content drought
---
I don't see why not, but it would be a lot slower than a Mage. Why not solo Mara or Tribute?
---
Are you on zandalar tribe?
---
Someones just told me now they're cross realm (which I dont think they added till later in Vanilla), it was quite common to wait several hours for a BG
---
500 upvotes, Gold and silver and a mod that answers the post saying that they are in the process of fixing this rule. 
---
Looks like your old grumpy ass do t want them but everybody else does, go back to r/wow
---
Everything
---
Let's be honest, getting pissed off of loosing a role in a lvling dungeon is just stupid, this isnt MC you can just run the shit again.
---
The main argument that is being made against this is that this will only worsen the faction imbalance. 
---
I get that, I really do. But people will sooner or later quit or reroll anyways, so Blizzard would be dump to not implement at least paid transfers for those who want to switch to pve because it‘ll keep some subs and also adds some extra profit. 
---
I also think Blizzard needs to do something about the faction imbalance and server sizes asap. For the sake of both the casuals and the hardcore pvp players. But that’s nothing new - on every forum and on reddit a lot of people are already discussing that every single day. 
---
So yeah, I‘m with you op. But I wouldn’t even mind if one had to pay for it tbh.
---
There's a "bug" with slam right now that allows to batch your slam with your auto attack so you do both at once. If this turns out to be a "feature" (like HS removing hit penalty). Then 2H Slam specc will be very competitive.
---
lol some time later but - the server has been ruined by mass ally transfers - my estimates is roughly 1 to 5 ratio and it appears as if most of the transfers have been farming raids since september - last night it took 8 deaths to get inside UBRS - that was rolling as our full grp and me getting in much quicker because of stealth. - The worst part is that we dont even get to take advantage of this imbalance with fast BG queues - cause of xrealm!
---
Thats what it looks like to me when using it. Sure, i might be clueless, but its still something i experience.   
---
You dont have to agree, thats why its a discussion.
---
I honestly think most intelligent people forsaw this right after they realised how fast we were able to clear the current content.  I know many of the people that knew this would happen, were actively supporting it. They actively feeding on vast stupidity of of places like classicwow, to push their messed up agenda.   
---
We have for atleast 2 months discussed this in my guild, and people have the mentally: "It will be fun for me. Even if the game dies, I will just move on to something else".
---
If it's not to late to start, it's not to late to reroll.
---
I see! Thanks for your input! Now I am a little less optimistic!
---
I'm thinking to switch to the alliance and roll a hunter or a warlock, but I want to know what would be the best alliance realm atm? I'm mainly focused on a pvp server.
---
There are far more horde players. Hence the issue. You don't see horde players complaining. You don't see all of the allies complaining, just some. So, vocal minority.
---
I never played WoW during vanilla but overall I've been very surprised by how everything is so easy. I guess it's just looking at the game through a different lens. When WoW came out, it was significantly easier than EQ/FFXI. But 15 years on, it was considered challenging by modern standards. As long as you play it with that EQ/FFXI mindset -- pull mobs carefully, avoid aggro, utilize CC and marking targets, communicating strategies with your team, build appropriate group comp rather than using whatever you want -- the game overall is very easy.
---
Also surprised by how quickly I can make money. I thought 100 gold would be a large sum, but I can get 100g a day by just running 3-4 random dungeons at 60 (less if something lucky drops).
---
The reason players go Gnomish-&gt;Goblin so so that they can craft Goblin Sapper Charges and Goblin Rocket fuel. If you already have a Goblin Engineer then it doesn't really matter.
---
If you're alliance I can definitely recommend transferring and joining the guild 'If I Die It Was Lag' lots of people doing guild runs in dungeons 
---
But it's a very good server yes
---
Is this going to work in low bracket battlegrounds when they come out? A 2 second full heal sounds broken in PvP.
---
Poly or mc for 30 sec removes the honorless target buff then kill for honor simple.
---
Agree 100%, the other day I posted a meme using the fat guy from the WoW episode of South Park and got like 450 upvotes in 3 hours before getting removed becouse the image wasn't WoW related. But then you see in the front page a gif of a bird pecking a dog's anus with 2k upvotes. 
---
Rule 4 is a deliberatelly ambiguous rule made so the moderators can personally dictate which post is they like and stays or which they dislike and remove
---
Now particularly people are running alts to avoid the WPvP carnage, so you'll be fine.  Last time I played my entire guild was running alts, we had a blast running stuff together.
---
At least you have your boys
---
Running sm brings in a good bit if gold from vendor stuff. I farmed basilisks in STV near the raptors. They drop 3 different greys that sell well. I would say I made close to 5-10 gold an hour just killing them between 38 and 40
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Never seen that behavior on the alliance side on Benediction.
---
Out of game logs are unaffected. All ingame logs are affected.  
---
Well we have an entire community of addon makers, that just got a new workload pushed on to them, if they want their addons to stay relevant, because of this combat log nerf. So i wouldnt say nobody cares.
---
While this is true, you later still need tons of mana potions/dark runes.
---
every dungeon
---
I think it will goto the caster as the mc player is the pet.
---
You will be fine bud
---
I have no problem with the general level of play being higher. People need to stop complaining or hoping for the state of the game from 15 years ago. It will never happen. Just go play the game, it’s great.
---
One percent of the time it works every time
---
That ius true, but is that something Blizzard wants to have happen? Tens of Thousands of players with addons, using up server resources for addon communication, when it could all be done like it was, 2 weeks ago.
---
It is... I know the first +5 is roughly 3% hit. After that i just think another +5 is 2%?
---
Or the classic «/e picks your pockets for 2g 56s.» 
---
Had some people getting genuinely mad and asking for their g back.
---
Books are not worth much anymore on my server anymore, that's why I would be good with just skipping him. The hellcaller pack adding sounds like a pain though!
---
they should get involved in a way that makes sense tho i feel like.. bouncer in a club in real life with goblin logic applied: 30 year old chad smashes 21 year old girl against a wall, girl responds with pouring her drink on him, bouncer brutally murders girl, then slaps 30 year old chad on the wrist permanently until he leaves.
---
Uhhh, like half of them.
---
he's summoning himself now
---
rofl thats epic
---
Or you can just literally opem the thread, scroll to the bottom and read them yourself, you lazy fuckstain.
---
They are clueless and it's not funny.
---
In vanilla we had groups of servers called battlegroups, not from day 1 but introduced in 1.12
---
Equating a 1v1 gank to the deathball corpse camping.
---
Applause for being an in-character Horde.
---
Paying 15$ a month
---
You're making a leap in logic here,
---
You're assuming that the current size of servers without layers is equivalent to a single layer was previously, while there is no data or information that supports this.
---
Dude stahp, if the community wants to shit post why not let it? You’re basically just trying to groom this sub into exactly what you want it to be rather than what it would be naturally
---
People not typing like 10 year old's would alleviate this problem.
---
A better solution is literally in the OP...
---
Faction queues could be a secondary measure in case BGs don't fix the problem.  Don't introduce new system while there are potential fixes on the horizon.
---
epic mount for sure. but really since they put in the gear buffs right at the start of the game, it's not the true vanilla experience at all.
---
What is the reasoning behind taking ruthlessness for horde and imp poisons for alliance? Is it just WF totem? I thought ruthlessness was an overall dps increase over imp poisons?
---
It is never too late to start with one of the greatest games ever. 
---
Wish u the best for your journey!
---
and then to reduce layer hopping abuse shortly after release they increased the number of players per layer
---
and then to remove layers for phase 2 they put many realms 2 large layers on a single layer
---
$$
---
Okay
---
You refuse to answer the question.  And I don't have time for this.  So you're muted.  90% sure you're a bot anyways.
---
BRE armor debuff is incredible in all situations for all of classic. But only for the warrior wielding it. If you want to reduce Rags armor to 0 (he is a warrior class boss) you need sunder armor, faerie fire, and annihilator axe.
---
To me, the question was about how he could reach 806 healing, and whether Azuregos helm is required for it.
---
Maximum possible +healing without world boss loot is, in fact, exactly 806, *before* spiritual guidance. I'm assuming the original comment did include it, because otherwise such a gear set would be severely lacking on health/mana.
---
Yup, I think it's more rare to expect to tank in end game. Therefore if you take the DPS angle which you'll be doing through leveling you'll be fine. Raids I've been in have 6-8 warriors at times? So not all of them are tank spec and need to DPS. Also the more gear you get the stronger you'll become. I think knowing how to tank will get you into groups easier throughout end game though.
---
You would still have massive population imbalances. You would still be corpse humping your way to dungeon entrances. I'd still be laughing at Blizzard and it's playerbase.
---
Lots of alts being leveled. Also with alts many people tend to call in a leveled friend or hop on their main if something's not going well, which can make it even easier.
---
That sounds fucking horrible lol
---
Yup. Many just use those success story videos as evidence and an excuse to stay DPS while getting groups quickly because they "tank".
---
I had much better success putting feign death with pet passive on its own macro then just casting the trap afterwards. I used separate keys for traps but im assuming a macro with alt/shift/ctrl modifiers on the second keybind wouldn’t work any differently at all. This also gives you the flexibility to have your feign death be the same no matter what and your traps independent of that, nothing like wasting feign death while setting up for a pull or something
---
How else will they make room for the dozen or so daily "WhAT aRe ThE ChAnCeS?!" roll posts?
---
Nah, don't think so
---
Oh man, too real.
---
PSA: LAYERING GOT REMOVED
---
PSA: you are an ___________
---
Halt side?
---
Because Fury dps is mostly based off AP and crit instead of weapon damage. To break it down more, Bloodthirst scales purely off AP and is your main dps ability outside of auto attacks. Whirlwind scales off weapon damage but uses both weapons in its calculations and is a secondary filler ability to BT. Heroic Strike scales off weapon damage, but is purely a rage dump. The most important aspect to Fury is stat scaling. Fury scales super hard with crit, hit, weapon skill, and AP, which is why a fury warrior in greens will do like 150 dps, but a warrior in pre raid bis with world buffs can do over 1k dps. To put it more simply, a weapon with very good stats like crit, hit AP, or chance for extra hits, will outperform weapons with higher dps/damage with no stats. So even though Viskag has higher damage than Brute Blade, Brute Blade is a much better weapon due to its stats. For this same reason, blues like Dal'rends or Miras significantly outperform other weapons with similar dps, but without any stats or with a chance on hit to perform 200 damage or something. Rogues rely much more heavily on weapon damage than fury warriors, whereas fury warriors rely on item stats to boost their dps which is why items like Savage Glad Chain or Lionheart helm will increase your dps much more than getting a Viskag to replace your Dal'rends.
---
Why are you even posting this? This was BEFORE launch or during launch when layering was active. Layering is now gone and the servers have WAY more people competing for resources and other things on the same world.
---
See this is perfect! Had not thought to have Frenzied Regen on my bar. Now that I think of it it sounds like a super useful ability. Usually I open in Cat for some decent burst but now I'm thinking the best plan is to stay in bear the whole time. Or probably cat/root/bear now that I think of it. 
---
Now to get some practice!
---
Aged forty years, aged negative ten years, aged an hour or two, aged eight centuries. Me and the boys are big fans of time travel, clearly.
---
This has happened to me, I rolled an alliance on a large server. It’s mostly horde so I can’t do anything in the open world without being spawn camped for hours on end. I have stopped playing the game until they sort the server population issues out.
---
Alliance side.  When they nag for portals, I  “/s opening a portal to Ironforge!” then open a portal to Darnassus.  Gets them every time.
---
Fair enough. Hopefully this will resolve the waiting time issue however I'm still not 100% convinced that this will resolve the issue in OP.  Like anything with classic at the moment, when it gets released, people will "no-life" it for a week or two then move on.
---
Humans - no 
---
Rest - maybe most rogues only want them for pvp anyway unless your guild cant get Viskag or Brutality drops
---
Yes, it was introduced in 1.12 because of faction imbalances. 
---
It's not comparable to LFR, which is PVE content tuned to the lowest difficulty that enables players to get free loot while semi-AFK. Battlegrounds are battlegrounds, you can still lose and if you go in expecting to be carried like LFR you're gonna get stomped.
---
Holy crap, how old were you and what stage of the game was this?
---
Got my hands on The Silencer, level 37 gun with an “Equip: +14 attack power”
---
I am a warrior, level 36. Still need gold for my mount, I’m about halfway to the cost. Should I keep this blue or sell it on the auction house? By my math the attack power would only increase my DPS by like 1. Maybe I’m doing that math wrong. I could also most likely get 10-12g for this on the AH.
---
Looking for opinions here
---
Have you tried using slashfour? It's an add on that aggregates the nonsense in the lfg channel, so you still get the functionality but don't have to parse the spam. You can even minimize the chat window for lfg altogether.
---
I love that song. Lol
---
Iam horde and love wPVP
---
if you actually follow the alliance community on Twitch, you can see that lots of them are fed up, lots of them have quit the game, or hope they can come back the 10 December.
---
The first week of wPVP was awesome, now every day they are less and less alliance on the world and it just become farming honor which is becoming tedious.
---
Plus if you think that only the people that are directly concern by the problem (mostly alliance) are the only ones that think the game is a hot mess, that wrong.
---
Some people have empathy and understand that what is happening will kill the balance.
---
It comes across as arrogant for two reasons, one- usually these I'm always right types aren't always right and people get jaded by the false positives, and then two- if you did tell someone to do something, and they didn't and the recognize their fault now, what do you get out of reiterating that you were right? Everyone already came to that conclusion from the way it played out, do you really need to kick a person when their already down to get your petty verbal revenge? 
---
Imo the best avenue is to lead by example, you can't force someone to change, just declare how you would do it and let them learn. If they don't, don't group with them (or associate with them if in the context of irl). 
---
Being a knowitall just makes you look like a dick, and who wants to be around someone who compulsively criticizes everyone and everything. It's tiring
---
my guild has that requirement for BWL. Everyone needs 100 fireresist (unbuffed) or they wont be allowed to participate in the rsid, once it releases.
---
Was in the same situation mate. Also leveled a priest to 60 and is decent geared. I chose to lvl a warrior as an alt, and my god, it's a whole lot a fun. 
---
Fury is the pinnacle of All dps and you can tank litteraly everything once you get the hang of it. everybody wants a warrior friend. Combined with a priest, you'll be set for the rest of classic mate.
---
 Got mine on the same server tho, so was able to funnel gear and gold as I leveled up. Since warriros are so gear dependent, it's a must if you wanna have a good time.
---
But with a priest and warrior in lvl 60, you'll never be out of things to do and People will stand in line to add you to their friends list.
---
Reduction from one blocked attack is literally nothing assuming gear i mentioned in my first post
---
You forgot the humor tag. Shadowmeld is garbage lol
---
Sorry for snapping bit you must understand all Chinese not in the mainland hand the communist
---
Mara is easy money as a warlock, semi afk. DM is relatively intense always, even as a hunter you have to be on point. But it is the best gold per hour in the game. 
---
A mage is a good choice as an alt, quickest to level if you can aoe farm and can make a lot of money quickly too. I would rate them in between warlocks and hunters for making money, hunter being the best class in the game. 
---
You have a choice, imo, go with whatever alt you would like to play the most at max level as all 3 are fine choices.
---
Most welcome. I think that for dungeon tanking there are other better options. Have a look at Skarm tank's YouTube channel if you did not already, he has many good tanking related videos (and they are quite good, even for a guy who likes his guides in written format) and he has at least two guides discussing fury/prot - one is something along the lines of "when to go fury/prot". Well worth watching.
---
Nice got a link for that? I'd love to join
---
&gt; nobody cares kid.
---
Except you apparently, since you're following me around like an idol.  As I said in another thread, you refused to answer the question. And I don't have time for this. So you're muted. 90% sure you're a bot anyways.
---
Good algorithm though, gets the job done.  Give your master a tip.
---
Question on the best tanking methods. I ran dead mines last night with a 3x caster group. I only had one impatient mage amongst the 3. I was 2h tanking with a slow staff so it was hard to generate rage. All that being said I think I did well. Rarely did the mobs peel off me until they were in the 25 percent range.
---
My question is this: when I'm tanking packs of 3-5. What's the best way to generate quick threat on most of them? I was typically charging, stance dancing, demo shout then battle shout then tabbing sunders. My group would blizzard and fs pretty quick so I had to be fast. 
---
Is there a better way? My only thought is quicker weapon. But maybe I don't know the multipliers well enough
---
Server?
---
I don't remember what stage of the game. There were battle grounds and I remember one of the new zones looked like a volcanic wasteland with a bunch of demons running around.
---
I was probably 10 or 12 at the time.
---
What is wrong with You?
---
Fuck, he cant act
---
You were right, blizz always stayed they were phasing content (honor system prior to bgs), and that the low servers were essentially high servers in vanilla. Everyone knew there’d be at least a month of insane world pvp, and here’s the kicker, ON PVP SERVERS. Theses people still don’t want to understand that they can go to PvE servers, or join a low pop server, for less pvp. They were ignorant then (no offense intended) but they are purposefully obtuse about it now.
---
Seizure?
---
Don't know about UBRS, but for 5-mans, make sure to mark the targets. If one is CCed, one is nuked, you only have to tank 2. frees your healer up as extra DPS, and makes runs so much smoother.
---
this is just hurtful to read. just a warlock that once noticed he a had a hot on him, while he did life tap to top off his mana and thought to himself that it was worthy to post on Reddit
---
That's not even that big of a difference. You act like they're all level 60 in a gank squad in the same zone. They're not. Quit the game and play something else like Roblox.
---
Don’t transfer to Earthfury. We had a virtually perfect split in population and this recent batch of transfers fucked everything up.
---
That’s my gut thought but I needed someone to tell me haha
---
Anecdotally i can tell you Illidan horde side in vanilla was wayyyyyy more populated than some "high" pop horde dominated pvp servers in classic.
---
True. I think most people would rather spend a bit more on Big Iron Bombs to save on inventory space.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg
---
man i didnt know this trick and my buddy and i dueled (i'm a mage he's a warrior with FAP). I won but jesus it was a hard fight. Sheeping from now on lol
---
There's a shaman called Hi. Whenever we kill him we all emote /bye.
---
^^^ yes, definitely a hidden roll behind the scenes. I've definitely rolled first in a tie and lost.
---
Just not a rookie
---
I had fun. Not knowing any better I was content just crawling along.
---
Main hand white dmg is also affected by this.
---
I’ve never seen that.
---
this hit too close FeelsBadMan
---
I play it too don't worry I'm not calling anyone out.
---
It's one of the higher skill caps in classic PvP. 
---
Braindead would be a warlock -- DC, corruption/agony, fear, watch as your target dies.
---
Spriest too, PW:S, SW:P, dispel buffs, fear, laugh as they die.
---
Rogues can actually be outplayed and the difference between a good rogue and a shit tier rogue is clear almost immediately.
---
I play mage, also pretty braindead, but a lot of room for outplays.
---
Rogue and hunter are highest skill caps in classic imo (meaning it takes solid class knowledge and mechanics to be the *best that one could be* at that specific class)
---
If +5 are was an upgrade to the rogue -- as bad as it feels for you -- it's in his best interest to need, especially if he doesn't expect a better upgrade anytime soon. The story goes a little bit different when fighting over BiS at 60 Vs a minor upgrade for someone else. But this is the name of the game. Can always discuss loot before going in. 
---
Anything before lvl 60 is also pretty irrelevant, unless it's like a weapon for a rogue, who heavily relies on it.
---
And the warlock -- just a dummy. Don't group with him anymore.
---
Because server pop isn't the driving issue, it's something people are trying to make a point so they don't have to admit they are fucking stupid.
---
This guy was right, but he wasn't alone.  Seeing this coming was relatively easy.  What so many people don't want to admit is the idea people have of what vanilla was, never existed.  There is this idea of server communities and world pvp and everyone being happy.  The reality was much different.
---
The server communities people claim they want, are much more prevalent on smaller servers where you know a larger amount of people.  Cooperation between guilds is important for shit like world bosses because you can't rely on any random pugs you find to do them correctly.  Players who fuck over one guild can get blacklisted and can't fall into a sea of faceless masses.  Despite this being a common desire, people flock to megaservers where this doesn't happen.
---
People want a vibrant open world where pvp just happens not like on retail, but when that never really happened in classic.  Yes there was some ganking, but outside of TM/SS wars, most people kind of ignored each other.  I know on my server we more or less had an agreement to not fucking with other faction guilds heading to MC/BWL/AQ because it would escalate and delay everyone.  PvP was done by the pvpers, and that was done in pvp situations.  The PvP guilds would kill people, and if you were in one you were more or less open to kill.
---
People don't want to accept he player base has changed in how they approach the game.  Years of refinement of information about wow has reduced the game into the component math.  Playing classic is much closer to the last time I played retail in MOP than when I played vanilla.  While it could happen, people were dramatically less likely to just chain run instances for the one specific item they wanted.  A huge amount of people are doing it now.  Wonky specs or gear weren't actively mocked for being shit.  Part of it was we didn't know any better, but the other part is people now have very high expectations on how everything should go.  I see people bitching they have to spend an hour or so finding a healer or a tank to do an instance.  Shit, I remember if you didn't have someone from the guild to do it, it probably wasn't going to get done at all.
---
You know what is the same?  People mostly sitting AFK in IF/Org waiting for something to do.  Wht made vanilla a specific type of experience was how the players approached the game, not the game itself.  That is never coming back because it was driven by lack of information and very raw ability.  Over the past 14 years players know so much more about the game and are prepared to handle dramatically more things than when vanilla launched.  We can never get the vanilla experience because the vanilla experience was not know fuckall about the game.
---
As opposed to joining in on the so called "pvp" going on on the counterparts?
---
You sound like you have some issues. You stopped playing a video game because someone asked you to help them out in a dungeon that you could ignore/reply "no" to and on with your leveling journey?
---
Hmm...I somehow doubt you.
---
How good is Quel’serrar for warriors?
---
Mortar is a trinket, not sure how that's related?
---
Low bracket battlegrounds are already broken.
---
I have no idea if this is required for BWL nowadays, but the requirement for MC certainly was completely unnecessary.
---
Really? So as a human fury warrior it would make very much sense to save my dkp for BRE if I already have brutality blade + Mirahs?
---
To be fair, while the name is funny, you can't expect people to not get confused :)
---
Why are they useful for AQ?
---
So click it once out of combat and it'll work the rest of the time? Do you do this every time you login?
---
The balance is already dead and xfers will in no way fix that though? So all you are doing is fear mongering and demanding changes that you don't understand and won't fix the core problems. All it will do is spread those problems to other servers.
---
Ouuuuwww
---
That reminds me of rush a Rush Hour scene.
---

---
Haven't noticed any chat lag on any of the eu servers I play on. What server/region is this?
---
This is the answer I wanted! Ty
---
So you want the advantage of being better than everyone else without everyone else having that same advantage?  So having access to google killed this 15 year old game for you?
---
&gt; just make it a 2 part film instead of making it 10 season show. There's never gonna be another game of thrones ever again
---
Personally, I'd prefer a tv series just because there be more screen time in which to build the world on. It wouldn't necessarily have to be 10 seasons long and depending on who you ask there never being another game of thrones ever again could be seen as a good or bad thing.

Also touch of weakness adds a stack of shadow weaving
---
I love pvp. It's one of the main reasons I'm playing for when bg's finally get here. But this is not what I signed up for. Blizz should have told us the servers would be 5x's the size, at least. This large pop increase allows large wpvp groups to literally control and camp every contested zone. I'm 60 so I don't feel the impact nearly as much as all my friends that are still leveling. They played more than me, but suffered from severe Altism. They didn't realize it would be this unplayable at the low 50s either. This is NOT the vanilla experience. They are already playing much less. They try and log in off hours to quest some. Dec 10th is honestly too far away.
---
You do realize that addons like Details are already communicating with each other, right?
---
&gt; Imagine the big pvp fights, with tons of addon communication on top of them.
---
It’s already happening, and the lag when there’s 200+ people in a zone isn’t caused by those addons.
---
Play on a PvE server. Seriously.
---
Thx for the kind words. It takes less letter to simply say "I disagree" next time, but being an asshat is always nice.
---
No, the mana oil overrides the windfury.
---
It'll def change after BGs.
---
leave that guild immediately, leadership seems to be completely clueless.
---
In 1.12 dps is so high that any kind of resist requirement is obsolete on non-tanks, you simply kill stuff too fast before aura damage on vael becomes an issue. On firemaw you go out to reset stacks anyway, it makes no sense to use resist gear for it. No other boss even does any significant elemental raid damage.
---
It's mostly horde crying they cant 6v1 alliance if they leave.
---
Yessir
---
Not bad. Probably one of BiS for now for Humans. Orcs have better axes. Everyone else should get Eskhanders Claw in MC for threat/damage. Quell is nice for mitigation but past that the claw is better for non Humans and Orcs.
---
Yea there's slightly more alliance. But from what I've seen horde players are more inclined to PvP, which makes end game zones usually pretty balanced. You do get insta-ganked when flying to a lot of places as alliance, but I'm sure it's the same for horde as well.
---
Its easily 8 spell power.
---
BGs are cross-server so server specific imbalance wont contribute to queues.
---
Just crazy to me that for a human its less that 30 DPS difference between thrash blade and ironfoe--Thrash is crazy good for how easy/early you get it!
---
&gt; Well we have an entire community of addon makers, that just got a new workload pushed on to them
---
You keep repeating this yet you’re completely unaware that most addons that would now need to communicate with other instances of the same addon were already doing so. 
---
You’re a clown.
---
there is little reason to actually bring an enhancement shaman.

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Hyq1GFD3Lah8wrXm/#fight=14
---
We don't need anymore healers, are melee heavy and love our enhancement.   I'm not really sure how to read these logs, but you can see some of the dps and rotations here.
---
Note that IronForge Pro only counts players who are in a raid that are uploaded to Warcraft Logs.  So it's not 100% accurate since not everybody on a server is currently a lvl 60 raider, but it should still be better than picking on completely blind.
---
You're right, I confused it with the Portable Bronze Mortar.
---
The Culling of Subreddit.
---
Riposte is incredible for leveling because it reduces the amount of damage you have to absorb, hits about as hard as SS, and is one of the few things keeping other rogues and warriors from eating your lunch in wpvp as combat.
---
As the main healer who got the eye first in our guild:
---
Fuck you, be more valuable
---
I made a ticket concering the issue and it got deleted.
---
I played back then.. your argument is awful because this isn't comparable in scale to the original. You can't multiply server populations tenfold and expect the same results
---
This is probably true but deep prot is so limiting. At least with fury prot you can throw on a dps gear set and dps when there’s another tank around.
---
Ive been slow to level, I’m 54 on a medium pop server. These last two levels have been a shitshow. I got Gankes 3+ times and hour in Feralas last night. It’s sometimes fun avoiding the campers only because I’m a rogue, and I can stun,sprint,vanish. I can’t imagine leveling a non stealth character right now it’d be hell
---
What is Hydraxian like? I've never played on an RP realm
---
Lol all you did was add an additional adjective.
---
My MaN forsenCD
---
&gt; According to Reddit etc my server is super horde favoured, and yet I spend every evening fighting large groups of alliance
---
Ding.  Same here, main is level 50, every time I try &amp; level I get rolfstomped by the numerous alliance death squads scouring the 45+ zones for that single HK to share between 5, rather than going to TM/SS for the guaranteed raid v raid warfare normal people are doing.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
I'm not sure I understand your point here but I'm sorry you've been called an evil korean without people even knowing who you are. That's stupid.
---
Anyone who understood what "the vanilla experience" was, should have understood what was going to happen.  What made vanilla different from the rest of the wow expansions had nothing to do with the content or mechanics, it was how players approached the game and what they knew.  We were all dumbasses walking through with hoods on.  We were slowly figuring shit out, and that showed in how we played the game.
---
It took me awhile to make this realization, but I did by Cataclysm.  Vanilla wasn't some glorious golden age of the game, it was the dark age of the game.  It's like people looking back on their time in high school as the best time of their life.  Yea, because you didn't have fucking any sort of responsibility and your body worked no matter what you did to it.  IF I went back to high school knowing everything I know now, it would be dramatically different.  I've changed so much there is no way I could do it the same.
---
The glorious vanilla experience people wanted was based on the players all being idiots trying to figure out the game rather than the game itself.  People who never came to this understanding are the ones who want to blame other people right now.

Meh,  if someone wanted to be “super l33t squad” and join a pvp server that’s on them.  Refer to my previous comment.
---
Da boys represent!
---
It varies. Sometimes it's alliance controlled, sometimes it's horde. Same with Light's Hope Chapel and Everlook.
---
I see both opinions on wowhead. Are you sure? I re-drop WF a lot, so mana oil will remain on the weapon regardless of the totem dropped?
---
No I'm nostalgic for phase 2 chaos. Dont speak for everyone. This is the best time in the game and you people are taking it for granted
---
Are there enough nodes that aren't guarded by elites to make this worth it?  When I tried this most of the nodes I found were guarded by elites I couldn't solo.
---
500g is like 4 flasks on my server, it aint much gold tbh
---
This isn’t a job play what is fun
---
Reddit loves to say a lot of stupid shit.
---
Is this accounting for abusing HS queuing for guaranteed offhand hits? It doesn't sound like it if DB/DB is simming over DB/FA. (Since it's not possible with DB/DB which leads to a ton of missed potential rage gain)
---
I don't care if it is horde or alliance, its toxic and detrimental to the game or community in either situation.  Factions don't matter when the player is just being an elitist asshat.
---
Thank you for your kind concern. It was an anecdotal comment, don’t take it to heart.
---
I didn't keep track but if you die, you can run in again and finish the run. So I didn't waste that much time except for corpse running. But sure it took a while to get a good strategy :)
---
Give it a different name or just give it a unique icon.
---
Lemme guess, you're the same type of mage that expects a tip for water in dungeons.
---
what? oh... nvm
---
How come the information is highly inaccurate on details, after the combat log nerf then? You can have two people in the same raid, with widely different values on details.
---
I mens, if it already did all the communicating with other players, why would it be affected this much by a combat log range nerf?
---
Thorium point (thorium halte in French) Thanks i'll correct with that
---
We don't need to be so concerned with PvP balance in low level BGs right?
---
Classic WoW isn't a game designed around balance.. Look at Classes.
---
Having a lot of people to group with is pretty important, I mean if you’re not 60 yet by the time you get there if you’re on a lower pop server you might have a hard time trying to find a group as all the 60s will have advanced beyond that.  Regardless good luck.
---
Not really. The entire point of doing it is by aoefarming the place. Only mages would do it. You’d get better money farming virtually anything else.
---
Sounds like the congressman has way too much time on his/her hands to worry about dumb shit.
---
Bartender has x y coordinates you can lock elements to. There’s also a grid overlay addon to visually align elements.
---
It's all the same to me. Chaos everywhere. Always ready for pvp. It's a lot of fun and you'll never experience this in game again after dec 10th. 
---
I remember players cried and moaned the same way back in 2005 and when bgs released they were happy for about 7 months before the crying and moaning started again about how bgs dont reflect their individual skill boo hoo.
---
People need to chill out. A few deaths no big deal, cant play well roll an alt or log off. Why you haf to be mad? Is only a game. Enjoy it.
---
It really shows the amount of sociopaths that make up the gaming community.  Gotta get an extra rank a week earlier even though this game will be out for years, so they literally hunt down and camp people with zero ability to fight back.
---
Idk man frost mages are 1 button
---
The druid quest to get bear form as a 10 year old was impossible.

When i did it a few weeks ago it was soooo much easier than i remember.

Right. That’s what he said

Yes. I'm a Rogue, and I've accidentially poisoned my mh while grouped with a Shaman. No wf! QQ
---
only if you view time played as time wasted as opposed to time enjoyed
---
They joined pvp servers under the expectation that they would be somewhat balanced. Even 60/40 would be acceptable most of the time.
---
Switch years with days and this would still fit
---
Would have been fine if they had opened the appropriate amount of servers. With so little options and so many players jammed into a few servers it exacerbated any issue that was present on pservers. World pvp wasn't that bad on nost.
---
I was expecting 9 warriors to charge you from behind while you were laughing
---
I target self, zoom in real close and use the circle underneath me to line up. I guess it's not exact but it gets me by.
---
He still got honor tho
---
Are you suggesting people should play a race they don't like the appearance of AND risk playing as an underdog just to helo with balance? Not sure why I or anyone who prefers Horde would do such a thing, it's not our fault.
---
Leveling and sticking with a class.
---
I member in vanilla i had 3x lvl20 and a level40 as the Honor system dropped.
---
In classic i got a level60 with very good gear and stacked on consumables.
---
I play rogue. There is no way to remove rogue poisons in classic (as in vanilla) other than to replace them with another temporary enchant or poison or let them time out. If you poison your mainhand, no wf totem for you for 30 minutes. Totem doesn't override poison or sharpening stone. It seems reasonable to assume that oil will not be replaced by wf totem buff either. Rockbiter is just a good example because the totem buff doesn't overwrite whatever buff you have applied directly to the weapon.

Shouldn't have transferred off Herod. Shot yourself in the foot. Suck it up or reroll.

Haha, What a pussy.

'... but you really do deserve it.'

'cept those aren't the people that were already 60 and killing you, are they?
---
Well whatever, it keeps the PVP alive I guess.
---
You did nothing wrong
---
Yes, I know you can do that and I have sacrificed void while CCed. The rogue then usually disengages and waits for the shield to fall off.
---
So everyone who argues servers are bigger aren't making a leap in logic here?
---
The information provided by Blizzard that servers have far higher capacity than in Vanilla, was made when layers were active. They never made any comments stating that server capacity post layers were higher than in Vanilla.
---
TL;DR: We don't know.
---
\*Grabs pitchfork\* So it's a repost then?!
---
Ok, misinterpreted it.
---
Moveanything works with classic and let's you set exact coodrinates
---
I don't know why you think this is a relevant post to reference. 
---
The post you're referencing is written very emotionally, the guy is clearly venting on Reddit. Not a reliable indication of his server status or "dead" server status in general.
---
As far as your idea to transfer in batches. I don't dislike it but the reality is, the people that like their servers and find the faction imbalance tolerable will stay and those that don't will leave. Same as it is currently.
---
I think that there are issues with the current state of world PvP but I'm not a fan of population control solutions, they tend to create additional problems without solving the problem they were meant to.
---
Got it, thanks
---
Who cares about faction imbalance. 
---
Alliance players are leaving the game like mad men.  Either blizzard does something about it, or this game turns into a PVE game with no option to PVP at all.
---
fEMALE tAUREN HUNTER BRO. woops caps, but keeping
---
This is what happens when you don't socialize on a social game. Also disabling tutorials on your first playthrough and not reading tooltips.
---
You're hurting the guild by wearing unnecessary FR gear because you're lowering your DPS. You're flat out wrong.
---
Maraudon?
---
Thanks for the info. You can still poison the offhand tho I think.
---
This is the best game, right up there with a stonard portal while someone pulls all the whelps.
---
Everybody knows that Blizzard is on vacation between Blizzcon and xmas.
---
Nha, classic community is pretty big and very casual. Osrs is a very niche game, with its own very niche community. Both are 15 yo games but majority of osrs is just 18-20yo students, while in classic you have a lot more adults.
---
Its much more global and because of its big reach its also much more casual. Also dont forget that a pretty big chunk is also retail players that come from the other sub.
---
Why does it matter how much he plays? Not at all relevant. All he did was answer your question and you just insult him and give unsolicited advice on how to spend his time. The fuck is wrong with you?
---
Claw is trash lmao. Only better if you can heroic strike literally every auto to avoid glancing penalty, otherwise you're significantly better off with edgemasters+anything else
---
You’re golden baby boy
---
Not sure, I know Brilliant Mana Oil (ZG) comes later, not even sure about mana oil.
---
Yep.
---
For raid healing I’d rather have the extra mana for a couple of extra heals. It provides the equivalent of 11 int worth of mana (ignoring Kings buff) which is generally considered better than 8 healing by most calculators. If there was a pure +healing that was more than 8 it would be a different discussion.  
---
With talents you’d have an extra 330 mana with both enchants which will give you much more total healing than 16 spread across your mana bar (keep in mind flash heal gets very poor coefficient as well).
---
If you have very low +healing total, then the 8 spellpower is much stronger - but I wouldn’t recommend it overall.
---
Trinket?
---
I have sacrificed void in those situation. In the couple cases this has happened, either the rogue blows through the shield and kills me or disengages and then the cycle begins again.
---
It's possible I was just fighting very geared rogues (they were from some better/top Alliance raiding guilds). I win most fights as SL, just not vs. rogues.
---
It's literally just you killing someone with reincarnation...
---
So much this. As we are better geared and more knowledgable now I wondered if people would be more tolerant on hybrid specs and different gearing. You don't need eveyone with 'optimal specs' to kill raid boses was my logic. In hindsight I was mistaken now as we know what is 'best', then thats what raids/dungeons expect. 
---
Rather than it being the vanilla people pluckily struggling to clear MC the game is now a speed run.
---
Hyper focused people expecting the same specs and gear from everyone to get things cleared as quickly as possible. What amazes me is the amount of people who won't run dungeons where they get a few upgrades, instead wanting to run instances repeatedly where they only get 1 upgrade, their BiS. 
---
Not everyone is like this but it seems way more than in vanilla where we were more clueless. 
---
I can see why you'd want to clear things quickly and efficiently, but then what then?
---
? I had AOTD and a random green and was tearing through it. I know this because I've already done it, lmao.
---
If u have the rends stick with swords for pve.
---
No, you’re just wrong about your characterization of Alliance races as wildly less flavourful than Horde races.
---
Lmao that answer for a short sentence.
---
I'm good where I am, people reroll on my sever cause it's great tbf, I didn't meant hurt you m8.
---
When I read the forum I find it silly and amusing that people on the dominating keep telling the opposing faction to quit their server and improve the imbalance rather than being on an healthy server themselves.
---
Faction buffs I would assume.
---
My boys left long ago. I play a different faction on a server I did not choose. I spend my limited play time slaughtering my former alliance brothers in arms in STV.
---
Quite common and several hours; I never had that experience on the 4 realms I played on across both factions. 30 minutes for an AV or 10-15 for a wsg or AB, sure. And that was pre battlegroup as a 70/30 horde server. Maybe if you try at like 4am. But during normal hours, expect nothing over 20 minutes for wsg/ab, 3-15 minutes during peak hours.
---
What? Are you reserving all the drops from these dungeons? No way 4 random runs with rolls on gear nets anywhere near 100g, I doubt its even 50g
---
I'd rather not have the frontpage littered with the same clips over and over either, but I'd take that over all the whining any day.
---
As if having some kind of daily complaint thread wouldn't be enough. Instead, even posts that have nothing to do with the current situation at all are flooded with negativity and irrational hate. So many comments acting like it's John Basic Orc who is to blame for the current situation.
---
So many people on my server left /r/classicwow already because of all the hate and the lack of actual content or discussions. Making this sub an even bigger echo chamber doesn't help, but I can't even blame them for not wanting to use it anymore. As long as there is discord it's fine, I guess.
---
Need more exposure, this is good stuff. I was just sitting here laughing in my car
---
Yeah it’s why masterloot was removed from retail.if we had it Reddit’s way classic would be personal loot.
---
That Druid also had nothing to do with it with half energy or half full rage, I’m horde so I enjoy some of the karma killings here don’t get me wrong, but attacking someone who isn’t meaning to fight is a pathetic gank imo and I play on a pvp server.
---
 fight people who want to fight/their own level, you being lower challenging them is your choice but people who are trying to level during phase 2 are the victims of the honor farm this season untill BG is out. Please post more pvp video’s of you killing 60 while being considerable lower than them I enjoy that also +1 for Shaman.
---
Just started doing raids, are there any good guides out there for setting up something like healbot (as priest)? Seems so customizable idk where to begin.
---
Basically yes
---
Where's the healer?
---
Ok, boomer
---
Totally worth it lol
---
Stolen from osrs
---
Any game will lag whit 300 players in same place...
---
Yeah. Wf totem only applies to mainhand weapon if you're dual wielding.
---
Darnassus is wonderful, IF and SW constantly have horde camping portals. Atleast on Stalagg, is it not like that on non horde dominated servers?
---
This right here.  The problem is that memes shortcut your brain's critical thinking process.  You see a meme about something you recognize (say, a game you like playing, like WoW Classic), your mind goes "hey, I understand that reference", and releases a little bit of dopamine.  More often than not, you click the upvote button, and move on.  The question of whether this is a useful post (or whether the meme is even funny in the first place) never enters the equation.
---
That's why most major subreddits have to specifically ban meme posts.  Because even in subs where user polls indicate that the users overwhelmingly do NOT consider memes to be quality or interesting content, they tend to get an inordinate amount of upvotes and often choke out legitimate content.
---
Ok that's good to hear so I don't get discouraged if I die a few times trying. Thanks
---
It wouldn’t fix anything because you are expecting that the people that login are all going to be 60s who actually go into the world. If you have a large under leveled pop like most of the servers where people are complaining and asking for this you will never get an equalized poo
---
ive got 10 gold waiting for you come on innnnnnn
---
Farming SM catch gets you some good gold. Sell the cloth on the auction house or to guildies and vendor all the drops.
---
Why is your empathy limited? It's exactly the same for Horde on Alliance dominated servers.
---
There is no proof they have enlarged server cap more after removing layers. In fact, most populated servers experienced queues after layers removal.
---
They want to go back to the good ol days when everyone was ignorant.
---
Same mentality of a Geek Squad employee.
---
I posted a meme and it reached 3.2k upvotes before one of the mods decided to remove it.
---
When asked why, I was told "Because there is literally 0 WoW content in your meme. Base image must be wow related."
---
Mind you, the image wasn't from WoW itself, but it was indeed WoW related or else how the fuck could people relate to it and upvote it to begin with here?
---
I have seen plenty of threads that had images not from WoW itself, and they were all allowed to be kept up.
---
This subreddit is swarmed with terrible biased piss poor moderators.
---
I felt this
---
Totally my way to play warloc in dungeons :)
---
But nothing is better then casting hellfire with a pocket healer.
---
Classic WoW uses a version of retail's API. There's no official documentation for it.
---
You can find source code in this repo:
---
https://github.com/tomrus88/BlizzardInterfaceCode
---
You can find a very incomplete fan documentation of the API here:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/World_of_Warcraft_API
---
An important concept to learn are secure functions and taint:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Secure_Execution_and_Tainting
---
There were **no** expectations of that from the devs. Idk why anyone thought otherwise.
---
On Stalagg there are horde everywhere.  No place is safe, major cities are camped 24/7, Menethil Harbor belongs to the horde, BRM has always been a horde zone.  There are a lot of hardcore Alliance guilds on Stalagg which are geared coordinated and skilled though so BRM isn't an issue on raid nights.  For the most part the horde on our server are pretty uncoordinated and stupid, they rely way too heavily on numbers so when a fair fight comes their way they just attack face first, so it's really easy to farm honor as Alliance on Stalagg if you're smart about it.  The honor disparities between the horde and alliance on our server is insane.  A lot of Grizzly members had 250k+ honor last week, meanwhile the top horde player can't even get to 100k.
---
I have a ton of thorium and a ton of mithril, and i'm not sure the best way to use them to make profit. I have made a lot of thorium grenades, but those dont seem to sell too well - maybe go for thorium shells instead? For mithril, I use some for sappers, but need more stone than mithril for that. Any suggestions?
---
Okay? Those faction ratios should even out any minute now then.
---
Whoever thinks this is PvP has some issues.  
---
This is just farm, nothing more.  
---
People will wait for you to land, prepared and with tactics and you can't do anything about it.  
---
Then we have the usual reply : ***ClEvEr UsE oF mEcHaNiCs***  
---
That's cool and all, but you are trash.  
---
You are farming an in game currency to get PvP items and a title that does not match your skill and when you are caught in the world alone, you will probably suck at pvp and die because all you know is how to abuse game mechanics, and when you in the BG, you will be still shit.  
---
90% if the high ranked alliance players I have caught alone in the world alone died like flies, and I am PvE specced combat rogue.
---
What I think is funny is the amount of people saying go back to retail or some shit when classic plays so much closer to retail now than it does vanilla.  People want the best items, so if they are BoE they are expensive as fuck.  A very close no2 is treated as virtual garbage.
---
The game is basically the same, but the people playing it are entirely different.  I never played private servers, but I did realize the player base would never treat vanilla the same way.  I have been surprised by a couple things, but in general everything is going more or less as I thought it would.
---
I think that's it right here - I just don't want to the game to progress without me though so that's the other thing. Like you said it takes time if you want to get the mount/make money/pve/pvp
---
I tank in raid furry since respec is so fckn expensive. I would be happy to tank 5ppl in proper prot arms spec. But class identity, character specialisation and all this no changes shit...  You know...
---
I did play Vanilla on a PvP server as the less-populous faction, and of course ganking and camping happened, but absolutely nothing like Classic P2. It was an occasional irritation and occasional fun encounter, not something that made half the game world unplayable. 
---
BRM could be a battleground when raid groups were entering MC or BWL (still nowhere near that video someone posted on here), Hillsbrad and STV had plenty of gankers roaming around, but there was a lot of relatively "fair" PvP. I had a great time with it. 
---
What changed - player knowledge and attitude, server populations, and faction balance. I do agree with the original OP that adding WSG would have helped, but world PvP is by no means an impossible concept.
---
no changes tho
---
When I leave town I fill about 10 extra bag slots with arrows.  As I use these arrows, the bag slots clear up.  There isn't really a negative impact to stacking a bunch of extra arrows.  
---
Running out of arrows feels like one of the scrubbiest things a hunter can do.  I will not be caught with my pants down when I need arrows.
---
Nah he’s horde. If anything there should have been 9 orc warriors showing up to keep that video shorter and more reflective of reality instead of this 1v1 outlier
---
fire shock my dude
---
quicker weapon and getting engineering. At low levels the engineering explosives are really cheap to make and are good at getting a burst of AoE threat.
---
Oh man I almost said something silly, because I saw TF and thought this was about tanking, it's fury warrior dps not tank dps. Carry on!
---
What the fuck. I’m not too knowledgeable on loot etiquette and stuff but rolling need on an item for his alt when someone else in the group needed? Isn’t that super fucked or is that normal behavior.
---
That spriest sounds awful. I main one and you know from the second you use mind blast for the first time with a group that it pulls aggro off of almost anyone.
---
The interview we're referencing. We know roughly how many people were on servers in 2005 and we know that this was the layer size at launch. We know that the whole point of layers was that they would dynamically increase in size as the amount of layers shrunk.  We know we're on one layer now which is essentially the largest "layer" that has been available.
---
To suggest otherwise is to suggest that our one "layer" has been capped back to its original size and that \~90% of all Classic players have quit.
---
More anecdotally, if you played a high pop server in 2005 and 2019 it's pretty obvious. Or even a private server where they published player numbers similar to 2005 and compared it to Classic.
---
&gt; For me it has to be gold income.  
---
They added the "quests give gold instead of XP at 60" later on but released that with Classic, so that helps significantly with income.  I have all of WPL to do after 60 (not that I can do them right now). lol.
---
Does this account for the heroic strike queue not-bug that makes offhand autos never miss? Definitely think that would make slow offhands more optimal
---
A lot of guilds dont allow gutgore bc it takes up a debuff slot but I'd ask ur guild leader or raid leader to see if it's okay before you spec daggers
---
How is he gonna do that?  
---
Oils won't arrive until P4
---
You got to experience that, this is the first time i'm playing vanilla WoW, and i'm all by myself.
---
Dude, I am sure you make the best of it and perform well as enhancement. But if you build a raid from scratch and have free choice what to bring, including an enhancer is simply not optimal. Your link is a good example, just checking most other bossfights than the one you linked shows the discrepancy in dps that is hard to make up for with the provided buffs. You seem to have a pretty amazing shadow priest btw. What I am writing is mostly about correcting this other dude who claims enhancement is the ultimate dps upgrade over anything else.
---
I love warriors who forget you can stance dance for your other abilities. 
---
Had a warrior yesterday try to kill me, popped retaliation when he started losing and whoops, disarmed. [It swear I could pinpoint the moment he realized it was over.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSe9ugpXIw) He stopped for like half a second, tried to run away and hit piercing shout to slow me. Intercept, Execute, Dead.
---
Of course there's always the chance they have Steel Weapon chain, and I run around with [Death Grips](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18722/death-grips) because of the plethora of rogues. Still worth the attempt though, if disarm fails, you get slightly disadvantaged by losing a GCD and some rage, if it succeeds you win bigly.
---
The weird part is identifying yourself by the show.
---
I'm not saying we do know servers are larger but making a PSA and claiming facts that aren't provable is very different from my saying that they're making a leap in logic
---
For pve yes
---
I've been a level 53 Mage on the sub-faction on the server since P2 came out. I really, really, *really* thought people were doomsayers and exaggerating the hell out of what the consequences would be for "slow levelers" and what would happen out in the world when P2 rolled out, but boy I have never been so wrong. It really did happen. I have not been able to do one normal night of questing since then, and it is beyond infuriating. I think i've gotten 3-4 bars of XP since then, before i've rage quit and logged out. I have started another toon on a PvE server just to be able to play, but I would pay Blizzard a pretty amount to be able to transfer my Mage from PvP to PvE server just so I could finally get him to 60. It's so incredibly annoying to be honest.
---
Guessing the rogue vanished!
---
I admit I don't understand why anyone wouldn't just re-roll a new character on a PvE server if they want to play. If you enjoy the game, but are able to say that you wish you were on a PvE server, then for now roll. At least then you could be having fun and waiting to see if you can transfer over later. 
---
To note: I don't suffer from the want/need to keep 2 months of work on a toon. If I'm not happy with the server, and moving to a PvE would make me happy, then I'd move. Starting over is still playing and having fun again.
---
That's just my opinions on this, and my not fully understanding why anyone would keep pounding away at frustration instead of starting over.
---
Not a player cap, just a ratio cap. For example, queue any players that would cause more than a 60:40 faction imbalance.
---
Oh wow , I'm not sure I decided to go horde for classic but there's not alliance camping the org/uc/tb portal areas.
---
Actually there was alliance in org one time, but not like you describe.
---
When I played northdale darnassus was my favorite aesthetically, but the layout of IF is so BiS and stormwind is beautiful too
---
Horde cities SUCK, thunderbluff is the only one I can tolerate.
---
I play incendius btw, pretty sure it's minimum 55/45 horde dominated
---
Very true, that makes since. I do have a shield as well for pvp. I guess I should say for dungeons. Do you think 1h / OH or staff for dps in dungeons. I'm thinking 1h / OH
---
It was just an example that i could find. I think this post is getting a little off topic. 
---
The point is, i dont really know for sure what the status of each server is. I have looked at a few of the big websites and seen icy veins / wow head have used addons to roughly track population numbers. The servers available to me do not look promising.
---
Regardless, even if the servers are full, i dont have exact numbers and it is unsettling making a big move without knowing accurately what i am getting into. 
---
My point is that if blizzard could do something along the lines of batch transfering, as i mentioned, they could ensure healthy server populations and balance accordingly which both factions could appreciate. Using "dead server" was clearly the wrong word but its not the point i am trying to make
---
is you deaf?!
---
no, yu is blind!
---
It's less as much that but more as much the general community pushing retail ideals upon it. Rush to max level, get a bis gear set and do the 2 incredibly easy raids and then complain there isn't anything to do. 
---
People complaining that others don't know the stupid cheese meta strats. It was hard enough to find people for a regular dungeon run, no aoe farming. Just a normal run.
---
Are you going to hurt these cows?
---
Sorry for you, but I don’t think that is going to Happen.
---
Get to 60, then worry about pvp.
---
its not worth the hassle. its too easy to pug mc so they only go for about 100g at this point.
---
Lol.  Swifty was top 1% of pvp players.  He taught us to use skull of impending doom ffs.  Pls don't use an innovator as a reflection of the playerbase.
---
All HW pvp premades used engi and consumables.  The point is the other 90% rarely did.
---
The bag is not unique, having one doesn't stop you from getting another.
---
Yup, and only cleanse once every 5 seconds. That's death for a warrior.
---
Except it's 75/25 on Stalagg and that number snowballs because horde group up in Alliance hot spots because they're starved for honor and alliance don't leave major cities because if they do they will get ganked by raids of horde.
---
yep, its either leaf or eye.
---
I was actually going to go orc hunter because you can form a personal wolf pack (mount + pet + non combat pet from ubrs). Plus orc hunter reminds me of the orc from the Lord of the Rings movies.
---
Alliance side dwarf is the obvious choice.
---
Plus if you document your loot agreements via in-game chat you can have a GM punish them. People have been banned and stripped of items, even for dungeon shenanigans such as the party leader flipping to master loot right before the boss pull to ninja.
---
You want to be able to punish ninjas? Clearly document how the group will roll prior to starting your dungeon or raid. Done. There's no need to cry to reddit about it. (And there have already been a ton of posts about ninja looters where the general consensus was that no ninja looting occurred.)
---
The game is different on PvP servers now. You just need to adapt, not adapt the game to you
---
&gt;I'm going to go ahead and assume that the number of loser NEETs on any particulsr server will be low enough that it will be a nuisance, rather than a game breaking oversight by blizzard.  
---
&gt;Just how many unwashed, neckbearded virgins do you think are waiting to prey on flight paths the day p2 drops while the rest of us are happily questing after work?
---
Oh my god
---
No, who’s on first
---
Your attitude is so one sided and shitty.
---
I’d be good with memes on weekends or a certain day. I don’t want memes all the time. I don’t come here for shitposting
---
Honestly when I was setting it up for my druid it took me awhile. I added each rank of the spell individually and tested to see how it felt to click it. Was it optimal at first? Not really. I immediately saw gaps during my first raid with it, but I changed some stuff on the fly to reflect what I needed.
---
On my dead server we put mc and ony weekly and there's wpvp to jump into any time you want. So dead.
---
Unless it is to signify a change of character, like your priest taking up arms and becoming a paladin.
---
It did matter to the question dummy, if you played enough on server you wont quit it easily.
---
Also, let me be worried about him, spending 40 ig days on a game that came out less than 3 months ago, that's almost 11 hours a day. I didn't knew there was a politically correct term for no lifer nor that was an insult now.
---
You didn’t watch the whole video.
---
&gt;All of the existing realms have a healthy population. Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics. Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.

Its not fun at 60 because most people are group up into big groups just running around trying to find easy kills, camping FP or entries into dungeons in big groups.
---
cool story bro
---
Vanilla MC was way harder than classic because of which patch classic is based on.
---
It is absolutely the fault of all the people making horde characters. Then complaining that all the alliance are leaving.
---
spy making me want to quit rogue, trying to dodge the immense amount of horde camping blackrock mountain by trying to stealth through, they just check every corner once I pop up on spy and hey there I am trying to dodge them and bye there I go, dead

the truest statement I’ve read 10/10 feeling nuking mobs w hellfire
---
So it's the way he asked, I can kinda see that.
---
You could farm mara. It's pretty easy compared to tribute, especially if you got the Pathfinding talent.
---
I've died 10 times from DM entrance to DM:N, balanced!
---
Ah yes, forgot about that. Still, ’fairness’ e.g. in a guild, could dictate that it should be treated as unique until everyone has one.
---
Wow, that's beautifully balanced, Stalag is 75-25, so with pvp ranking, horde are constantly hunting for honor any way they can get it.
---
In my opinion just go whatever has the better stats for dungeons. If you have a 2h that has better stats use that, same goes for 1h/OH. PvP you want the shield for armor, since a lot of the Int/SP BIS year is cloth or leather! Having the extra armor makes you a lot tankier than other other casters.
---
Yeah, when they had layers. They don't anymore
---
Orc and Undead are by far the two most popular races on Horde, especially if you control for the fact that only Tauren can be Druids. NE, a purple and tall human, is about as different from humans as Orcs, a green and muscular human. Undead is more similar to Human than any non-Human Alliance race. Basically all that makes Horde races dramatically different from the Alliance races is that we all have hunchbacks, for some reason.
---
How  do I get level 60? I simply cannot play the game in high level zones because of gank squads. I got to level 55 from around 50, just by aoe farming in aszhara as a mage, found a remote place where gank squads dont come. I feel like spamming dungeons is not the answer. Ive tried, but the places are just hard camped, and yeah, you can waste an entire night if the group is bad. But im stubborn, I want to get 60 before BGs out. 
---
Anyone have any advice? I dont care if its slow or what ever. I just dont wonna play with a grey screen 75% of the time.

No, I do get it. 
---
1) Not inferior players, just people with a different mindset of what they find fun.
---
2) "IF" it fixes it is better. If the population imbalance is that far off, there will still be a LOT of ganker/griefers running around. More than there was in the vanilla days. If it doesn't solve the issue (which it might) then what?
---
I spent a month on my first character, played it a lot. Just wasn't happy with the server. I packed up, moved, and can play any time I want without being ganked. Then when I'm in the mood, PvP starts. My choice. It is correct that I don't fully understand why anyone would leave themselves in a miserable position, when they have a way to fix it. That's just staying in an abusive relationship, and making excuses for staying.
---
Because a lot of them are leaving because of the imbalance?
---
I think I probably kind of agree with you but I can‘t seem to follow your line of arguments. If you want the game to be a wpvp game then you would care about faction imbalance, wouldn’t you? The greater the imbalance the less wpvp (and the less player in the minority faction), it‘s as simple as that. 
---
So no matter if you‘re more drawn to pve or pvp, for the sake of everyone on pvp servers the imbalance needs to be fixed somehow. Because as you‘ve stated, it‘ll turn to complete pve if it‘s not.
---
Damn it, Yavene. As your future shit poster I order you to make this repost.
---
I did 70% of my level 57 grinding here and I had to leave early because my bags were so full, as I only have 1 traveler and 3 runecloths atm.
---
I got countless greens, a few recipes, and the enemies either dropped runecloth (extremely common), Major healing potions (common), superior mana potions (common), or roasted quail (common), then the rest of my bags were filled with valuable greys. So it's really profitable and with all items considered it's probably 30g/hr.
---
Bag space is super important for this farm, and also being alone is important too. Some people are figuring out how OP this spot is and it can easily get competitive with more than one person.
---
like an actual broken record.
---
Yeah I think people wouldn't pay 200g, but it would have to cost 200g to be worth it for the mage selling them, thus I don't think it's a very good item to try to sell in general.
---
A 1v1 here ? impossible, there is more than 60 h2 camping there
---
I never even had my epic mount in classic. I was like 12 and I spent what I had always. Getting fiery weapon, buying dumb shit in the AH... never farming, had zero professions. 
---
Now I'm a priest and I have my epic mount 900g, Truefaith Vestment \~350g, Hide of the Wild \~300g, Benediction (eye of shadow) 300g, and +55 Healing Power 215g = 2065g
---
That's with 5 days played time at 60, 300 tailoring, 300 herb, 300 fishing, 300 cooking
---
I can't believe how dumb I was in vanilla, it's so simple to make gold now and there are several options to keep it interesting.
---
I find issues getting groups on Smolderweb - but honestly it's probably because I'm not a tank, healer, or mage. If you're not a mage no one fucks with you regardless of what server you're on.
---
im not even 60 yet.  in fact, just hit 55.  to get into BRD or LBRS on my server as alliance, i die 4-5 times to level 60 horde camping the flight path, the road, the ramp into the mountain, the entrance into the mines at the bottom, and the entrance to the instance itself.
---
and i have stealth, so i die about half as much as my guild mates do trying to get there when we run something.
---
we have persevered so far, but there has been talk within our discord of just dropping the game for a while because outside of dungeons, it is literally unplayable.
---
for the record, this is on Kirtonos, which has a heavy horde-favored population imbalance.
---
Thx for this
---
There is only one reference matchting this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAVnOz7i-JA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAVnOz7i-JA)
---
Nature protection potions.
---
you didn't see one person ride past you on a mount and wonder how to get one?
---
Don't know why people aren't stating the obvious solution: instead of realm transfers, free faction changes. That way they don't need to move to a different server/low pop server.
---
While true, I'm unsure of the purpose of this post. Is this just a "we told you so"? Maybe schadenfreude? I'd rather think of creative ways to solve this issue for people suffering from Blizzard's unwillingness to make meaningful changes to the (garbage) honor system.
---
One potential solution I've seen is allowing people to enter instances as a ghost. This would drastically reduce the amount of time they spend being camped and let non-raid geared players level and gear up in relatively peace.
---
In fairness its almost completely useless 99% of the time. Using a GCD to see buffs that you cant do anything about or can either already see via animations is just a waste of time.
---
I kinda regret spend my gp on brutality blade....i’m an orc. Is deathbringer mh brutality blade off hand good for an orc?
---
Oh, for sure. Any of those types of recipes are extremely rare to find yourself, but with so many people being 60 for so long I've noticed more and more popping up on the AH. I've even noticed a lot of the MC recipes are becoming more and more common, just because so many guilds are raiding every single week.
---
A big reason for this is the gear set that is available now. This gear set wasn't out so a lot of current pre-raid BIS didn't exist in vanilla right away. Makes MC and Ony laughably easy as a result.
---
now go pay some gold for respecs :D YAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRHAHAHAHAHA
---
Last night we had two routes roll for perdition blade. One rolled a 99, the other a 1.
---
You don't really need gear to farm tribute.
---
What you need is consumables and mage water. Drink everytime you FD and continue drinking while the boss is running to your pet. Having gear makes it easier, but it's not gear dependent.
---
Main hand has a 6% hitcap (9% if no weapon skill)
---
Yeah, but you can honestly hash that up to it being a new game and wanting to test the classes out and not knowing what you wanted yet. I logged on, created my priest, and never looked back.
---
Really depends on how they make the battlegroups
---
Same.  The front page of this reddit is filled with copy pasta memes despite the rule.
---
Is there an add on or a setting that makes the rarity aura on your equipped items glow like they do in your inventory?
---
Kinda what xShinobiii said already.
---
A lot of it boils down to personal preference. For example i feel like all Horde races and cities, except UC and the Undead are just so... primitive. I prefer to have cities more similar to real cities, not holes in mountains, huts on mountains etc.
---
The stories are pretty good for both sides. Some are tricky to find (for example on Horde side the whole Quillboar/Silithid story) but they are good overall.
---
Alliance Stories are mostly about the war and reclaiming what is lost, Horde stories are often more "nature" based i feel.
---
What people are like.. well. You will have dicks and nice people on both sides. Not much of a difference there i think.
---
For leveling in general i feel Horde is much better. You have more flightpaths at much better locations and faster access to many zones (STV via Ratchet -&gt; Booty Bay is much better than Alliance's Menethil Port -&gt; Theramore -&gt; Ratchet -&gt; Booty Bay or even Duskwood to the very northern point.)
---
I mean all these numbers ppl are saying is just conjecture or outdated consensus data, but anything near 75/25 would suck but yeah I don't take those numbers everyone's saying about their specific server too serious, no one knows the actual faction balance figures besides blizz
---
And same goes for both sides on incendius , any type of cheese to get honor.
---
you only have to wear it for the gear check.
---
Ya I was actually thinking seeing a 1v1, especially in that spot, is shocking to me.
---
I've been 60 for weeks and have not had a single 1v1 pvp encounter yet in classic... 
---
Last time I was dead in that hallway, there was at all times a bear minimum of 25 horde running up and down the hallway corpse camping
---
okay, not, you is the tank.
---
&gt;  should I roll warrior even though I want to play more solo in pvp rather than group 
---
Warrior is the most dependant class in the game by far. Do not roll warrior unless you plan on grouping constantly, and in PvP warrior is among the weakest classes.
---
Lmao on the fucking nail dude
---
This is what we're fighting against D:
---
So who needs a summon again?
---
You
---
Fuck you, I'm already here
---
Case in point.
---
There is nothing to be done:) it is classic. 
---
They could run shards ofc....but they won’t and players think they don’t want it either. 
---
But in this time and age classic will turn niche before vanilla got “old”.
---
Gonna say it’s probably not wrong the earliest creation date I can find for paranoia was in 2008. Well after vanilla. Just cause an add on works in the vanilla client doesn’t mean it was around in vanilla.
---
I'm asking you!
---
This is an actual high grade meme, I literally lol.

Have you tried a free transfer to a lower population server? That’s what I did and, while not perfect, it’s better. I finished Un’Goro yesterday and between 20h and 22h I got killed 3 times by a level 60. On my previous server, I couldn’t stay alive more than 5 minutes. 
---
Transferring on a lower population server has negative consequences too. The economy is much worse, been trying to sell Mooncloth on AH for the last week and they NEVER sell, even if I put them cheaper than all the others. Also, none of my green items sell. On my previous server, I’d empty my bags on AH before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning most of the stuff was sold.
---
Its a game people are having fun if I want to gang bang some random for 3 hours why not?? its what I want to do and I pay for the game the same as him. It's not anyone's fault if you get ganked nonstop get good fight back I have personally fought off hordes many times before. This has been a way of life in this game for as long as I can remember.
---
Gold as well but I used to spend all my time in BGs so I didn’t farm 5 mans like I have been this time around...but that’s about to change lol
---
No, What's on second. Who's on first.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
Why?
---
Devin Nunes is currently suing all of you FYI
---
And I find it silly and amusing that you're relying on the rest of the player base to make your wow experience enjoyable. A quick glance through your post history shows you complaining multiple times about how "terrible" and "awful" of a time you're having trying to level. Instead of fixing your situation so you have a better time you're blaming the rest of the playerbase for merely existing and playing the game on an opposing faction. While also having posts of your own about how you're "killing greys" because you have nothing better to do. Pot, meet kettle.
---
Alliance can put +2% crit on both weapons. Horde only put it on the OH assuming they are getting WF.
---
Fuck rule 7!
---
Lol, our server's guy is called Lacoste, and is probably not as expensive :P
---
Honestly, every single aspect.
---
It took me like 4-5 MONTHS to level to 60, classic took me like 2 weeks. 
---
I have thousands of gold, already rank 5 in pvp (and i'm playing like 4 hours a day), MC is a tutorial raid at best, and my /played is still a fraction of what it was on my first characters.
---
Honestly, it's really just a knowledge is power thing. We know all the math surrounding everything now. I never prioritized hit for instance, and i don't remember it being a noteworthy stat back in the day. Lots of people used to focus on main stats significantly more instead of spellpower (some people still do). We know what the most efficient builds are, the most efficient farms, what drops what, easy look ups for quest information, and better addons.
---
The reality is that classic is a completely different game and experience than vanilla was.
---
What? They aren't fixed whatsoever. Ion:
---
&gt; raise the population targets for each layer as people spread out that will reduce the number of layers that are created 
---
The *entire point* was that layers were dynamic. \~3500 is simply a target because that's "vanilla size". If they needed to make that number higher at the end of layering, they could, and they did.
---
it's You
---
&gt; In fairness its completely useless 99% of the time. Using a GCD to see buffs that you either cant do anything about or can already see via animations is just a waste of time.
---
no, and you're bad for thinking this. it is an insanely useful ability.
---
Fuck rule 7
---
This brings me back! When I used to play Horde, I mained a mage for about a year back in the day, around the end of TBC and the beginning of WotLK (switched for a Fury Warrior afterwards). After guild runs, sometimes I used to open a portal to Stonard to fuck with guildies. If their heartstone is on cooldown I always went and picked them up after a few minutes had passed, but it was so hilarious.
---
To this day I still have no idea why did they decide to add a portal to Stonard so late in TBC, but at least it resulted in lots of good moments lol.
---
Definitely felt the inspiration here
---
I do the Alliance a service, all gnomes are KoS.
---
Good players find other good players yes it will be harder I think you’d have better luck as a mage.
---
rogue wanted to play it coooooooooool - could have killed you 100 times more efficient with restealth - cheap shot - kidney shot - blind - restealth - cheap shot - evis. so many options. instead he decided to fuck around with his trinket.
---
Yup!
---
laugh at them and tell them to delete their account
---
Good. Multibox trash.
---
Not a priest, and never have played a priest, but this 100% matches what the priests in my guild have said as well.
---

---
I would argue that it flips it entirely into the warrior's favor. Literally the only thing that gives mages the advantage over warriors is frost nova. Hamstring+intercept matches blink+slows, its just that initial range from the root that puts it heavily into mages favor. Take that root away and a warrior sticks to mages like glue, and mages are the squishiest of the squishies once you get through their shield.
---
Curious link parses.
---
* Itemization - had no clue about stat priorities, my paladin just needed to have Lightforge and Dungeon Set 2
---
* Raid times - I thought raiding was something crazy people did, it seemed so hard to commit to a raid schedule I never raided unless it was a pug.  It's hard to commit to a video game schedule when your 14-15 years old
---
* Keybindings/Macros - Always played with the first few 1-8 and clicked the rest - now I have mouse buttons and everything macro'ed
---
* Economic understanding - I was poor in vanilla because I wanted 300 blacksmithing, don't know why I wanted blacksmithing.  Now I'm flipping 100 stacks of herbs and 200 potions a night, with 3-4 BOE epics up for 30% profit margin
---
* Optimization and overall game knowledge - I was told to spam Flash of Light, didn't know why.  Now I've got proper enchants, perfect rotation, top meters and parsing in the top 1% of my server
---
* Tunnel Vision and group awareness -- With shitty gear and shitty game understanding, comes difficulty.  I'd tunnel vision on a single task  such as healing the tank and not knowing where mobs came from.  Now I'm tanking 2-3 mobs, marking CC targets and pre-marking the next pack for pulling.  Can spot runners and patrols, control the situation, keep an eye on everyone's health, taunt off the dps, etc.
---
I see no link to WoW here...
---
Which he's not getting
---
Yeah I get the retail vibe too. The last I played of retail was the 'need X ilevel' dungeon groups. Never liked it as whilst I see why it happened ilevel does not necessarily- skill. Substitute ilevel for BiS and there you go.
---
And yeah its either BiS or not BiS, there's no 'quite good'. 
---
Never played on a Pserver, I suppose I had an idealistic view of Classic. Whilst I know that we know more I have been taken aback by the sheer 'efficiency'. I just didn't think that the content we had would necessitate the super-optimised gear/specs that are expected.
---
I didn't expect the scale of things too I suppose. From a full guild group taking a while to down Raggy/Ony, to a 30 man PUG downing Ony on first go was a wake up call.
---
The last slot costs 100g. The slot before that costs 50g then 25g for the one before that.
---
all memes should be allowed, its what makes the 2007scape subreddit so exciting.
---
The developers really should have done something to fix the inevitable imbalance at the *beginning* of Classic, not months later.
---
I know they don’t stack, I just didn’t know which one would have priority. Regardless of if they exist yet or not I still want to know. Thanks
---
fury warriors &gt; anyother meleee. that simple. why give a crappier class (rogue) the best weapons first?
---
While you're scrolling just tap that up or down if its content you want to or dont want to see on our sub. Everyone should do that imo.
---
&gt;Basically all that makes Horde races dramatically different from the Alliance races is that we all have hunchbacks, for some reason.
---
It's because you're all a bunch of no-lifers hunched over your keyboards, so Bliz wanted that reflected in-game!
---
/s
---
you got us on the first half, not gonna lie
---
Because Why is AFK.
---
a very profound truth.
---
Yeah cause we have so much other great content posted here. We are just full of well argued scholarly insights into a 15 year old game.
---
Peasants, they have no honor.
---
There is no “huge faction imbalance” on Faerlina tho.
---
You don't need an alt to farm gold, you have a 60 pally, the best DM E jump running healer. Get a warrior with good gear and mining/enchanting and you are looking at 50-70g/h.
---
My duo is warr/pally and this is how I farmed lionheart and epic mount easily.
---
It seems sad that most of my time in BRM is just trying to figure out the best place to die so I can make it to the entrance on the next rez.

Rogues have the highest skill-ceilling of every class in PVP.
---
I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor. This is my dream; this is my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor, and surviving.
---
It's pretty rough still at lvl 10. At lvl 11 it's okay.
---
What's the recommended min lvl to do a BRD part 2 run? We want to save the Princess. 
---
We did part 1 last night. It was a good group but I thought we were a tad underleveled, couple of 54 and 55 casters. Wiped a couple times because of the dwarves pats and couldn't handle the 4 golems in the vault on the first try. Think we're high enough lvl? We're all 54-57.
---
Are you trying to make an argument with this comment? Hes leveling casually, whats wrong with playing a pally? Fucking zoomers are moronic
---
For the most part this game does have a pretty good community. In my experience rogues are the ones you have to watch out for the most though. I've grouped with a couple asshole rogues. Generally speaking they are the most impatient class in the game, mages are a close second but they're so convenient I let it slide.

---
^(damn bro, couldn't even feed me a proper straight-line)
---
All his bags are ony bags
---
No, that's the hitcap if you use weapon + shield or 2h weapon or for yellow attacks
---
If you dual-wield all white attacks get those extra 19% miss chance.
---
So you would value 10 int (a bit worse than that) over 8 sp?
---
Yea sounds like it! Out of curiosity I just looked it up, and.. seems like paladins can use specific seals on each wave to make it a lot easier, ours didn't know that. The shaman quest is kind of the same quest? So I guess it's harder for horde to complete it.   
---
I remember feeling that if one prepares oneself, it's not as hard as it was when half of group were clueless. Sure is a good challenge though.
---
orrrr maybe I'm just tired of all the low effort "memes" people post. 90% of them are complete garbage that don't even make sense and they flat out ruin subs. But yea your reasoning makes complete sense, people definitely think that.
---
You'd be surprised. All warriors seem to have learned from vanilla/pservers, I almost never see one without a priest or pally in tow.
---
I ganked a warrior the other day, 3 black outs in a matter of about 15 seconds. I love throwing shadow word pain and a mind blast, then watching their health slowly drop 295 damage at a time as they are trying to do anything to stay alive.
---
NE warrior. lol
---
Their response *should* be to just release BGs now.  Giving world PvP a month to play out is nice in theory, but the reality is that that is a month of people being barely able to play the game.  It's extraordinarily stupid to stick to a timetable simply because they want to, when 30% of their players are in absolute misery and a (potentially *the*) fix is right there, ready to go.  Unless BGs aren't ready or something, which I doubt.
---
Tbh thats probably the most balanced thing you'll find in low bracket BGs.
---
yeah, on Bigglesworth I could sell everything, on Earthfury nobody buys even when its dirt cheap
---
no, stop whining.
---
I’ve dealt with social anxiety. It’s perfectly treatable and one of the best ways to work on it is introduction and practice in settings you have problems with. Simple grouping with minimal actual interaction would be a very ideal beginning step. If they actually have social anxiety and aren’t willing to take such a simple step, they aren’t even trying to work on it. If they arent working on it, they shouldn’t be coddled. At some point they are willingly being a hinderance.
---
Most addons do something that is "humanly not possible" that's why they use addons.
---
There are plenty of twink guides on youtube.
---
Right? Took me 23 deaths to get into BRD on Fairbanks Saturday. Over a good hour just to get into a dungeon. Really hope they offer paid PvP to PvE servers.
---
&gt; If the situation on Earthfury is like Herod, it’s fine.
---
I don't play on Herod and nobody on Earthfury wants the server to reflect that of one of the high/full pop servers. I think anyone would agree that a server with faction equity is the ideal goal, and we basically had it prior to these transfers.   
---
We're simply looking to hopefully slow down a trend of increasing imbalance that is noticeable by everyone and ultimately not good for anyone.
---
na, he just mage so prob bought for gold
---
Yeah, they use both in retail, no reason they wouldn't do the same here.
---
Okay, I was just taking your comment at face value. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Letting people transfer where they want will further kill smaller servers.  Blizzard still clings to the idea that people will leave big servers and go to smaller servers because of a queue.  History shows this won't happen, but maybe if they try this time it will!
---
Letting people go wherever they want would kill off the smaller servers faster and faster. For better or worse, that is what would happen.
---
the GSE (Gnome Sequencer Enhanced) Addon has multibox support. You can use 1 button on 1 account to cast the same spell on all of them. People farm gold and when WoW goes on sale they add another box to their account. You can farm gold and turn it into battlenet credit. Use the credit to buy boosts or gametime. You just need a strong enough computer and internet as well as lots of time to get setup. Then you can efficiently min/max and farm for a few hours a week to sustain the accounts.
---
I’m pretty sure this ones on you and not blizzards fault you aren’t having fun. If you wanted to play with your friends, then maybe you shouldn’t of all started on different servers...
---
I guess were at an impasse
---
I literally scrolled down for a good minute without finding a 39 warrior twink guide for classic
---
Leveling a warrior.  My first toon was a warrior and I was terribad.  I didn't read any of the spells back then (I did eventually get better when I learned more).  But yeah, I used to spam heroic strike and rend (once I had more spells when I learned about class trainers).  I couldnt really get past Elwynn Forest until my friends started playing.  Even then, I still needed help with quests all the time.  
---
So after years playing retail and taking a good 8 year break, I'm back at.  My main is now a rogue, with a back up mage close behind in leveling.  And my latest alt is a warrior.  Questing is easy.  I've got the gear and I've got the knowlege to use the right moves at the right times and taking on packs of mobs is usually no issue.  Got alchemy, so always have like 4 pot buffs, got my runecloth bandages rolling at level 21 and its fun and easy!
---
Rogues don't even have a stun at level 19
---
Get a good guild or a good pug from your friends list and run dungeons. It feels faster than grinding out levels and you'll be hopefully earning pre-raid bis gear to boot. Do LBRS/UBRS as well.
---
This sum up my game time everytime i log on. 45Min to get into brd yesterday
---
Thank you. What are people simulating with for classic?
---
Also, where does Deathbringer *without* Edgemasters end up?
---
Both versions come in phase 3. They each require different levels of ZG rep to buy the recipe.
---
Don't think you get what they are saying they walk on boat.then get ganked the boat leaves harbour before they can run to the corpse the loading screen happens.there  suddenly alive on the spot they died get instant killed even if they don't ghost when the boat leaves it will instantly Rez them after loading screen
---
I vote we make gnomes a 3rd faction in classic wow plus so both Alliance and Horde can kill them.
---
56 around. You really want at least one AoE caster for the torch room. The mobs don't hurt too much, only two break points are the golem before emp and the emperor himself. The emperor hits hard when enraged, at 56 you want to use some cool downs. Princess just needs to be interrupted and it should be manageable
---
Gotta go get that sweet iconic T1 set with Rhok and you’ll be good to go.
---
Would love to see some of your funny and original memes. Please post them
---
"Don't let your **dreams** be **dreams**. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. So just do it. Make your **dreams** come true."
---
\-The Bouf
---
&gt; Horde has no problem killing me while I try to quest without alliance backing me up when I call for help
---
Killing random questers isn't a good indicator of faction balance as it happens to everyone, especially those 48+. The better indicator right now seems to be which faction is more dominant at pvp hotspots such as Kargath, Everlook, Thorium Point, Light's Hope Chapel, etc.
---
You fucked up lol
---
We have a hunter in our guild named Somebody.
---
Yeahhh...
---
No I’m doesn’t
---
to be fair transfers were in wow back then and I do recall blizz saying it will be available eventually?
---
It would utilize a format, which by the sound of it, would give you a hernia
---
It’s simple. Honorbuddy/gb was a company that could hire devs and pay benefits etc. real talent. 
---
Then blizzard set a precedent with a lawsuit, and also updated their EULA to heavily monitor your PC while playing - even “out of process” scans are done by warden. 
---
As a result, most bot sellers are independent 1-3 man shows that only accept bitcoin and release products that just are barely acceptable. Any more effort/organization into fleshing out a feature-rich bot turns into a risk. Not worth the effort/$ return when you can pump out shitty grind bots, wait for the ban wave, and then rebrand and make a new one.
---
I had a couple of other hunters show up when I was doing my demons.  We all just took turns on a wipe while the others cleared mobs.  We all got our kills and it was significantly easier because there was room to kite and protection from gankers.
---
Where do I get the thing to teleport me into the portion of Mara that is close to princess ?
---
eAlign Classic: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ealignclassic
---
Majority of PvP players are horde, they will have longer ques.
---
And if that que gets to 20 minutes, well I can only assume they will try to farm honor somewhere else.
---
ironforge.pro is the most accurate right now
---
As a fellow rogue who isn’t amazing at PvP, cut us some slack yall. We may not know every enemy ability yet and we may be more focused on raiding atm, but we’ll get there.
---
I've got a shaman called Hu and I'm an officer. Over discord we get the occasional - ok Hu is going to tell us what to do.
---
If you don’t play on Herod, how could you possibly have any idea what the server is like?
---
The majority of servers have never been 50/50. Even assuming yours was 50/50 before (it probably wasn’t),  if it has changed it may be like 55/45 now. That is fine. World pvp has nothing to do with “balance” and it being an even fight. If you want an even fight in pvp, what you want is a battleground.
---
We're a smaller server, so the 7 alliance guilds that joined in the last 15 days absolutely crushed the delicate balance we had before. We need some horde guilds to restore this balance. It is really bad - each high level zone has constantly more than double the alliance roaming it - so much that alliance now comes inside orgrimmar looking for horde just because we dont have enough anywhere to fend off the alliance.
---
I have 2 accounts so I often /who zones on both sides, and I can assure you that it shifted that quickly. I've shared numbers on the Earthfury discord several times over to prove my point.
---
I play with 4G USB-hotspot since about 2 years, stable 40ms. Raided mythic with this in Legion with no issues. WoW really doesn't need much data, just needs a stable connection with no hickups.
---
How do you guys even get this far, the deaths start at the flight path for me, and don't end.  I don't even bother flying into the zone any more, but running on horse isn't much better.  Just a bunch of waves of horde looking to kill you three times, and let the next group take their turn.
---
Neither is my corpse at the start of the instance when I wipe at baron rivendare yet I ressurect at the start.
---
Just let shaman become pallies and vice versa. They both fill roughly the same niche.
---
I waited 12 hours for Hunar, Idgaf about Broken Tooth, hes ugly af and only attacks .3 seconds faster.
---
this person loves being the victim, clearly
---
Why 39? Being 1 point shy of Mortal Strike would be rough. You basically just have auto attacks at that level.
---
and the lowest skill floor, the sheer amount of cc and damage they have is insane.
---
People will be farming MC till the end of the games life because of a few items from there - primarily bindings. You will still be able to get into raiding, but the pre-bis grind will be harder for you because a lot of people are done farming those dungeons.
---
Yeah, you made a bad call here. 
---
CSC is better than the launcher by far due to the clip speed. Definitely focus on getting leaf/sinew for Rhok'delar. Ironically, once you have a Rhok, the concept of clipping goes out the window. With the way the math works on the Rhok, it's better to clip even when you're in a quick proc/rapid fire.
---
Rhok will be best until you get the Chromagg xbow and then that will last you until KT.
---
Had three bad runs with people from Altercation on Blaumeux, will be avoiding anyone from there as well..
---
&gt; Originally we had all planned to play on the same server but due to blizzards **lack of foresight** there were 5+hour queues on the servers we planned on playing on the day of release so we **just hopped on a server and started playing** 
---
So it's Blizzard's fault your crew acted impulsively and without communication?
---
They just want people to think they know what they're doing.
---
&gt;just watch sometimes 
---
Imagine being so bad at a game you get a robot to play for you, but you also have nothing better to do so you just watch a robot (that you paid for) play the game for you. 
---
I think you’re more of a TV guy than a video game guy :)
---
In early Vanilla there was a rare spawn wolf in Duskwood that did shadow damage, but that was gone by the patch that classic is. I think by this patch only Broken Tooth has this kind of big advantage.
---
post your logs then talk
---
I don't know about You.
---
But like, why not ask for something more useful, like flasks
---
Heal some dungeons with Healbot, get a "feeling" of how it behave.  
---
I have different spells on left, right, shift-left, shift-right, alt-left, alt-right, etc mouse buttons.
---
Plus I would recommend to install Decursive addon. It will allow you to heal and dispell debuffs separately. With only Healbot you will have issues if you need to urgently heal person instead of dispelling first.
---
P.S. Use skins. Default one is not suitable for raid, too big.
---
The emperor is the toughest boss in the dungeon and has an enrage ability that will absolutely destroy your tank if things go wrong. An ideal group at that level could kite the emperor and CC the princess, but it will be a lot tougher than doing it with at least a couple of 60s in the group.
---
What is that chat addon?
---
I'm one of the leaders of a casual raiding guild on Skeram Horde, believe me I know that faction queues would be a disaster.  We have a decent chunk of people that get on right after getting home from work to raid, throwing a massive queue at them would cut our attendance in half and basically wipe out this group we've built up over the past few months.
---
As a shadow priest I am 100% ok with this. Pull when I’m at half. Idgaf. I’m drinking and I’ll hop in when I’m ready.   If I want to hop in earlier I’ll pain and wand it out.
---
Kill 3 last bosses in Maraudon, sell drops to vendor.
---
Think about what you just said. &gt;Majority of horde servers are horde domianted.
---
So the majority of alliance servers are alliance dominated.
---
You sound like a jelly shaman who can’t get purple pixels :(
---
This happened to me a lot at launch. Once, when I was Level 25, with hearth on CD, it dropped me at the Altar of Storms...
---
Sorry but i'm pretty sure only the OH has an extra 19% miss chance
---
Why 19 twink. Why 29?
---
Cuz i think its fun without mount
---
Turns out servers aren't even Horde favored, our cities are just so ugly we can't take it anymore and head out into the world.

No, don't summon "yourself", "You's self"!

Actual imbalance will lead to this, and it will be worse

Yeah this guy seemed like he was just trolling, not even trying to win just being a turd
---
A comprehensive solution to getting corpse camped:  git gud
---
I really don’t know what you expect, servers maintaining a 50/50 balance is just not a thing. And it’s also not a problem if things get skewed a bit.
---
When even the alliance says that there is a problem, you know that it's not overblown. 
---
You get killed because you're questing by yourself and you're an easy picking. Sadly I run a small team of horde friends with me and we either encounter singles like you out in the world, or raids of 20+ that crush us instantly. Not really different than what you're experiencing, but on a bigger scale.
---
I don't know. I only ever get camped by alliance, never horde so how do you explain that!!!
---
Probably "Sorry I forgot Ankh"
---
Yes, they're weak. Enhancement is a meme spec, it brings some utility but that's about it.
---
I have my ups and downs on my server and I'm enjoying it once again.
---
You gotta just make sacrifices which I did, I avoid certain areas and wait for my friends to connect.
---
But do you realise I have been asking a question and not giving you an order or are you that susceptible ? Cause frankly you look like more trying to attack me than answer to my question and that's pretty deplorable.
---
Trying to remember, frost/nature in ssc, arcane for astromancer in tk, fire for illidan, and was shadow resist needed for mother shahraz?
---
You told them a million times? Wow that's a lot of times...
---
Could it be you're... *Exaggerating*

*Moves eyebrows up and down*
---
Yeah but there youve got a portal to the instance where your body lies. 
---
Also Im rather curious in how to wipe there.
---
Roger Roger, over over
---
What is the problem?
---
How about deathbringer + CHT with aged core leather on an orc?
---
Thank you for correcting me lol, yea I meant majority of servers
---
No changes
---
Other subreddits let you filter out content you don't want to see by letting people choose which flairs to see.
---
“Alt-right” lol.
---
deathray + CB evisc is such a satisfying combo to look at
---
What causes it? I see people like Pshero stream during those times all the time pvping and hes ranking.
---
What I don’t understand is that you get punished for being camped.
---
lol are you 12? wtf is this fucking middle school writting class essay format shit? jfc this sub is the worst.

---
Just started a gnome mage. My main is a Pally with blacksmithing, and mining. They aren't maxed yet but working on it. What would be good professions to go along with it? Ideally something with good money making potential. Currently I only have about 150g. And still need epic mount and will need 40 mount on mage when I get there. I was thinking tailoring and maybe herbalism?
---
Not a bad idea. I personally raid and pvp as arms. I'm the only warrior in my guild to do that. I tank for my guild when they need me too but I get usually got first priority of 2h weps. I was lucky enough to get Bonereavers Edge on my 2nd MC raid..now I'm usually always in the top 4 dps as arms...I'd say if you can get your hands on a good 2h wep then go for fury...a 2h fury war in my guild has Spinal Reaper and were usually the top warrior dps
---
Reported for HK trading.
---
As a mage, I don't even know what to say to his "apology" except laugh along with you LOL  😂  😂  😂  😂  😂
---
No, 2h is reallly only best for horde.
---
Well people aren't having fun anymore. A large portion of players are not. If you alienate a large portion of your game base it is not going to end well. It has not been a way of life in this game like it is right now. You cannot compare pvp of a 10,000 person server to a 3,000 person server. it is not even close to being comparable. 
---
Blizzard has come out to point out certain mechanics are being abused (mind controlling, going on roofs ETC) these are not how the game is intended to be played. Go ahead gang bang 1 guy for three hours do what you want. I just wonder what is so fun about it ? And if you are so in love with PVP why not switch to a faction were you are like 20% of the server. you can fight a lot of people.
---
The entire population on the server in one photo.
---
I found a fair few tanks while levelling who refused to take DPS warriors into groups, because they wanted the weapons/mail/plate for themselves.   
---
So you might experience a little of that.
---
Later on in the game, DPS gear and tanking gear are usually pretty different so its less of an issue. Tanks will roll on tanking items, DPS warrs ninja all the leather so it works out for everyone.
---
And as others said, once you get to raids DPS warrioring is far more common.
---
Found that aswell. But i dont feel like its a guide per say
---
Seems like this was done intentionally just for the laughs. You could've said "click on the paladin player with the name 'you'."
---
Or just capitalized personal pronouns like a sane adult.
---
Also in [Rush Hour 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZg3SCYBV7k)
---
Imagine not being able to understand that this wPVP zergfest isn't about PVP but about farming honor.
---
Ho so weird you are from the horde!
---
This meme is probably going to be removed but damn is it so true.
---
After I had another one removed for rule 7 I asked if they could specify EXACTLY what it meant. They said they just go off of reports, not really what the meme is.

Meanwhile, that meme of literally just the wow logo and text saying "the world is 4 billion years but we live now to play this!" Or whatever sat at the top of the front page.

Mods are gay
---
To be honest, Moderators suck and are self righteous. The most important part of this guys post is LET THE COMMUNITY JUDGE THEIR CONTENT.
---
You need to face facts that as a moderator you're doing a job that no one wants you to do, that you werent elected to do, and that you're doing poorly. Moderators on Reddit are poison. This is a self policing website due to community voting. That will always be the most important. 
---
Karma requirements, post and reply limits, and length of subscription time requirements are infinitely more effective than moderators, and you don't have to deal with power tripping lunatics
---
Imagine not real mixing this was a joke
---
SInce P2 came, my guild basically was cut in half. Everyone just raid logs now and we know how that goes. Pretty soon they will all just stop logging in altogether. Blizz needs to hurry up with paid transfers so we can get to a realm where we can actually play the game. The Horde on Fairbanks have basically made the game unplayable outside of raid.
---
Yea no thanks. This content doesn't require them anyway.
---
Enchancement shammy's are pretty weak in pvp sadly. Ele shamans have amazing burst damage and can be fun playing in pvp.
---
Sweet! What about mine?
---
No you!
---
&gt; so we just hopped on a server and started playing and we were all spread out. Now it’s not fun
---
You typed this out and still failed to recognise the issue? You are your friends are just horribly unorganised, most of us managed to pick a backup server where necessary
---
Next stop is getting to Blackrock Mountain alive.
---
It's obviously not as good as dualwielding but it's fine.
---
I just realized there is flaw. My calculation also includes cases where 3 or more share the first highest roll, not just strictly 2.
---
How does it works? I know about DKP, but I never heard about gold DKP.
---
The main test for the second section of BRD is the Lyceum, commonly called the Torch room. If you can make it through here, you can probably kill the Emp.
---
&gt;!In here there are a bunch of groups of lvl 50ish dwarves. There are packs all over the room and patrols as well. Additionally there are some red mobs whose name I can't remember, I'll call them the torch bearers. Also in the room are 2 braziers. To complete this room, you need to kill the torch bearers, take their torches and light the braziers. But until both braziers are lit, all the packs in the room will respawn very quickly. The key to this room is quick AoE, staying bunched as a group and being decisive.!&lt;
---
I don't want to give the details of the torch room away, it sounds like you guys are learning as you play and that's awesome. I dislike the modern playstyle of just reading everything online before you do content.
---
If you have a 56/57+ tank you can probably save the princess. Assign someone to disrupt her heals and be careful when the Emperor enrages. I think when he turns red, he will enrage if anyone casts a spell on him. Avoid him enraging and it should be a simple fight.
---
We have a healer in our called named "everyone"  Now just imagine baron Geddon fight... telling Everyone to get out of the raid... followed by confusion, then everyone spreading out 8 yards from each other, and the bomb going off.
---
Why tf would you give that pos money? Chances are they take it and then tell you to eat a dick while they try to tame it anyways.
---
It's not faerlina or herod.
---
They remove whatever they feel like using rule 7 as an excuse.
---
imagine not reasing the rest of the replies below me
---
Interesting, I would even rank 10 int under SP. And I wouldnt think its close even
---
I’ll indulge you, fine
---
Dispel protection for Polymorph. Dispel bait for other magical debuffs. And that’s just the secondary use. Being able to see what buffs the enemy has when *literally* no other classes can do so. Being able to see if the enemy player has BoF or FAP active (they have the same animation), or a Frost Reflector active, or which Ward the enemy mage has active, or Presence of Mind active, etc etc etc literally ad nausem.
---
If you think the spell is useless I got bad news bro
---
HmmMmmMMmmm
---
I don't know how your guild will do it, but chances are most Warriors will also want that weapon for PvP, and you will not get a pass just because you decided to 2h for PvE, when 1 handing is just better.
---
I do the same as you, I 2h for PvE and PvP, mostly because I'm lazy - but whenever a 2h'er drops, our guild lets pretty much all the Warriors go for it. Not just the ones like myself who are too lazy to play the optimal 1 handed fury build.
---
This. If gear is bad then focus on gearing before farming.
---
&gt; Healer: Who is the tank?
---
&gt; DPS: You.
---
&gt; Healer: No I'm not!
---
FTFY
---
he is a stupid child. 1. look at his fucking middle school essay post. B. "all my friends play league." 3. He crys because someone kills "his" mobs. Mommy needs to take away his computer for a while me thinks.

You want one in each raid for this:  [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=15331](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=15331)
---
Horde on Earthfury here, I came from Blaumeux during the first wave of transfers, server pop was def close to 50:50 at that time.
---
It certainly is not now. I would say 65:35 is an accurate estimation.
---
While tri, having it cross realm will greatly reduce potential queue times. I expect 5 to 10 minute queues, maybe longer for AV.
---
Which is irrelevant since horde is the more pvp oriented faction.
---
They will have longer ques based on that alone, then add in the fact that they´re driving alliance away from the game. Well the que complaint threads will be absolutely hilarious in 2 weeks.
---
Enhancer is super fun. Might not be the best, but damn does it feel good if the stars align.
---
We take one in our raid.
---
Kromcrush seems to be pretty balanced and is highly populated but not too populated.
---
I don't think anybody expects a perfect 50/50. But alliance needs to stop coming over to this server because it is NOT a balanced server... Yet people keep thinking it is because of [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) websites. It isn't. There are horde heavy servers that could find a great home here.
---
Why would the servers be dead? They are both listed as full
---
As long as it is in game and not ruled as an exploit, no one is going to blink an eye at it.  Top10 won't be scrutinized beyond ensuring they didn't exploit or use bannable methods.  Using a bug is commonplace for world firsts and saying that people won't abuse it is naive.
---
No one remembers the second place finisher.  Who was second to 60?  Who was second to kill Rag?  Jokerd used layers at the end but it didn't diminish his feat because it was available for everyone.  APES killed Rag and did so with whatever means necessary.
---
I don’t know.
---
Yeah as someone trying to rank up in horde, it's clearly not, its just farming
---
Please I want to have some fun with BGs and not run around all day to chew something
---
Every item that drops is auctioned off for gold. Whoever wins the item pays the ML the gold. at the end of the run all gold is split between all raiders.

Basically that your anecdote doesn’t really mean much when considering the state of the game

Enh shaman is most effective with the best weap you can find and Str/Int/Stam gear in PVP.  You are not a warrior charging into a group of enemies- your biggest weakness is CC, kiting, and stuns.  Your biggest strength is totems and utility, along with burst damage. 
---
You will struggle to secure kills 1v1 unless you have a really good weapon.  Otherwise classes will either out-damage you and you can't heal (MS warrior, rogue with stuns and other CC or spell interrupt) or will control the fight with CC (warlock, mage) such that you have to either run or fight defensively. 
---
You CAN be a great group support.  Hang out near your healers and ranged DPS.  Drop rank 1 shocks to interrupt enemy casts or slow enemy melee fighters (but don't bother frost shocking paladins, remember!).  Cleanse poison especially if the enemy team has rogues or hunters (watch for blind or viper sting especially).  Drop heals on teammates that need it.  Finally, if a soft target DOES approach you (within 10-15 yards) try your stormstrike, earth shock combo and hope for a WF proc.  Even with iffy gear this can easily do 2k+ damage if you get lucky with a couple crits.  But it's very unlikely.  You just have to be really wise about picking your spots and supporting your teammates. 
---
All that being said, Elemental/resto (30/0/21) is the strongest shaman PVP spec.  All the utility and support, a lot more ranged offensive potential, and instant healing wave for emergencies.
---
The torch room can be made trivial by running on the wall edges on the sides.
---
providing for my epic mount, also every level 60 dungeon. Everything appears so easy compared to 16 yo me in vanilla and compared to Elysium/northdale.
---
Wait, warlock is hard for warrior?
---
Doesn't give you an advantage? I can't sell any flower or ore anymore because it's at 80 silver each because one guy has a [14 druid multiboxing farm route.](https://i.imgur.com/RAlyDoa.png)
---
He picks 20 flowers at one flower, while i have to farm for like 10 minutes for 20 flowers.
---
time spent &gt; money earned, i get more money from killing mobs than selling on the Auction house at this moment.
---
I was never in the "no changes" camp, but Blizzard already made changes by significantly increasing the server population size. This is one potential work around that doesn't require drastic changes to standard wpvp interactions or game geography.
---
100% this.  
---
I have not been able to complete a single quest for the last 3 nights. No matter where I go within seconds of arriving, if not on the way there, I get jumped by 5 man groups of 60's. Who then will camp my corpse. If that is the case tonight I am done. I am not paying money for anti fun.
---
But [this](https://i.redd.it/2bqx2l0yji041.png) low effort?
---
You bid gold on gear. All gold is pooled together and at the end of the run everyone still there gets a split of the gold. People with lots of gold get ehir gear and people with less gold get gold for their time.
---
Community was fine first 2 weeks, and before level 50
---
Because of abundance of alchemists on my servers - pots/flasks cost exactly the same money as ingredients to craft them.
---
you literally answered your own question, Blizzard will not just open paid transfers to ALL/ANY server as it will make a bad situation worse in some cases.  
---
If you have level 60 friends, you could be 60 before xmas. no way are you too far behind to catch up. Folk are only in MC and Ony at the moment, so easily time to catch up.  
---
They wont listen to threats and temper tantrums to allow any/all paid transfers, so either re-roll, or find another game you enjoy playing.
---
Isnt there a big EUR based server too
---
It's decent in this tier, not top tier dps but not that bad. Not sure how they will do when fights are longer tho. I guess 'ill see since we have 1 spriest per raid.
---
I had a guy named you in my guild.. so annoying when he receives loot. You have to look for the s. You receives vs you recieve.
---
It was actually really annoying
---
Not saying this is terrible advice, but most guilds won't take an arms warrior/let you raid as arms, so OP you may wanna ask your RL/GM if you can raid as Arms. Being a GM/RL myself, we do not allow any arms warriors.
---
On my phone sorry but should be just a quick Google away!
---
Yes there are diff rogs and like I said they are all skilled players, all choosing their fights and what they put into the series.  You think they won ever fight? No, they just didn't add them to the vid.  
---
Again, using a YouTube compilation of ppls best moments is not evidence of anything, especially when it's relating to a diff patch. 
---
So discuss all you want, but I see no point to it here, as it's always subjective, non factual 'proof' people use to justify their opinion.  It serves no purpose
---
I'm sorry but this was a key point for classic, no transfers from PvP to pve realms and it should stay that way
---
The population that didn't underestimate others/knew what to expect shouldn't suffer because the casuals didn't heed the warning given dozens , maybe hundreds, of times on this forum alone.
---
If you really hate wpvp that much, take a break until December 14 and come back when BGs are out, or make a new toon on a pve server.
---
I felt the same about free xfers for anyone (until they swapped to faction specific )
---
It's classic , why would we want to implement the same shit that made retail into the game we all quit for classic lol!?
---
It's like those people that move because they don't like where they were, but then when they move they want to make the new place like the place they moved from?! WELL WHYD YOU MOVE THEN?!  Lol
---
Good.
---
&gt;For a better play experience, we highly recommend that players avoid creating characters on any realm marked as Full
---
Razorgore EU PVP is well populated (normally no queues but they can get up to \~50 mins on popular raid nights). Speaking as a Horde is seems pretty well balanced, plenty of times we've held zones, plenty of times we've had Alliance raids come in and mess us up. Alliance of Razorgore seems way more organised than Horde, they had something like the first 4 rag kills.
---
Only drawback that comes to mind is that in this way those who grind more get all the drops and in the long run this discourages from participating (knowing that you will never be able to get that piece you need). But then again, it should balance out as the gold will be - theoretically - better distributed after each run and nobody needs the same set piece more than once. Personally I never tested it, so this is as far as I can get.
---
You could just sell herbs for this pots and it will give you same gold.  
---
Alchemy now have zero "added value".
---
third base!
---
It's copper and not iron tho.
---
Copper and tin = bronze.
---
Iron and tin = crappy lumpy iron.
---
*licks lips*
---
And this is why we use a capital letter to indicate a name.
---
what's your vector, Victor?
---
Doesnt really matter what you build since you'll just be here to get farmed by viable twink classes.
---
It was an example
---
So what I'm assuming your talking about is giving raiders gold instead of dkp for kills and having people bid gold instead of dkp (dragon kill points).
---
If that is the case. Who do you expect to farm all that gold to hand out to 40 raiders?
---
If I'm wrong, please explain what you are even talking about because I'm lost.
---
Based on...??
---
If we are talking about MC only then I could see it (but any enchant is also unnecessary). I assumed we are talking about enchanting T2 pieces and prepping for the long haul (BWL, AQ40, etc.)
---
People can make an impact by rerolling alliance. Do your part and go to the less represented faction
---
It will be much better when all these people have battlegrounds on dec 10th. Much more efficient way to farm honor. Just hold your horses
---
&gt; If you don’t play on Herod, how could you possibly have any idea what the server is like?
---
if you don't play on Earthfury, how could you possibly have any idea what the server is like?
---
Did ever have a look a good, complex code? That's probably not how it works. In the best case you'd have to adjust two to three classes.
---
Who's on third?
---
Does anyone know about going fury with thrash blade and flurry axe as a human warrior? Both weapons have the chance to double attack. I have edgemasters.
---
Is the DM solo stuff hard? My hunter is almost 60, any good videos you used to learn it?
---
Do it! Played on a pve server on retail from Wrath through MoP. Rolled PvP server in classic and I don't think I've ever had as much fun as this. Only lvl 34 (in STV) because I'm an altoholic but seeing red pop on my screen and the thrill of figuring out how to react is great. Running up a hill? Surprise 60 lock riding past you. *Please don't kill me please don't kill me* sweet he kept going. it is exhilarating and I highly recommend it.
---
Just going to past in my reply to this exact topic from 2 days ago.
---
It's an exploration issue.  You can't res at other spirit healers for the same reason.  Blizz just doesn't want people using death as a mode of travel, especially considering it's faster than walking and removes you from the world.
---
\+1 super useful for OCD fanatics.
---
Do we need to bring the complaining into every single thread?
---
People should know to use quotes.
---
It's really hard to adapt fantasy series into movies because the world will always end up feeling underdeveloped and key plot points will often be ignored so that the film can fit in a 2 hour runtime.  
---
LotR is the exception here because those were made with a much longer runtime and was based off an IP that lots of people were already familiar with, and even then there are lines that are references to things like: Morgoth, Eärendil, and Ancalagon the Black which are never explained in the movies and thus only people who are very familiar with Tolkien's work would get.
---
Oh so just another unoriginal, unfunny, low effort meme. Got it
---
There may be a seed of truth to his story but I think he's fibbing a bit. For one, he's a paladin and would have got a mount without even having to visit a mount trainer. But he also perfectly describes hellfire peninsula and just happens to forget or not know the name of the zone and the expansion it's from? I think he's hamming it up a bit.
---
Larger server sizes and layering are some of the biggest changes Blizzard could have made. 
---
No changes is out the window mate.
---
I mean you make a lot of gold if you're not getting loot, so the theory is, after a few runs you'd have enough gold to buy the loot you want. GDKP is pretty much unilaterally used in Asian guilds. On US Realms it was used in the past (a lot in WOTLK) in pug runs. It's not used a lot in guild runs.
---
Pve server fella
---
I can relate to this one
---
There is an easy way to abuse OP's plan.
---
  1. Remove your armor
---
  2. DIE HAHAHA,, ah erm,,
---
  3. Walk to your dungeon and re-equip armor
---
Pretty much all stone sells well TBH, Blacksmiths need excessive amounts of stone to level.
---
Dense and Solid all sell especially well.
---
Herbalism for extra money while lasher farming. Tailoring won't make you much money but its worth going if you plan to raid for the BOP crafted gear. You can also make decent gold by skinning black dragonscales during rend runs, but thats going to be slower overall than lasher/zf farming.
---
I'm currently spec'ed 19/32/0.  I tank dungeons quite often.  Basically, I tank with a 1h/shield combo, I keep my armor above 5k, and equip dps plate gear as much as possible to focus on +hit and +crit.  You want to keep Flurry up as much as possible.  I'm also an Engineer so I use Dense Dynamite very liberally on pulls of 4+.
---
You want to use Revenge whenever it lights up (do not use Shield Block to proc it) and Sunder.  If you have 5 stacks of Sunder on a boss then switch to Bloodthirst but don't let the Sunder stacks fall off.  I'm big on keeping Demo Shout up at all times as well, helps make up for running with bare minimum armor and avoidance.
---
You are missing the one issue, the players and their nature to be selfish.
---
We had loads of transfers from heavy queue servers to open ones yet no one left.  We had loads of transfers from dominant factions to less so ones.  No one took them.  Partially because of the 'oh no dead server!' bullshit and partially because people don't want to inconvenience themselves.  "Why should I have to transfer, it's the other people that need to transfer." or "I don't need to transfer, I'm happy being on a 80/20 server because I'm the 80"
---
Batches won't solve anything.  You'll get tons of QQ over how someone's guildie didn't join soon enough and the quota now locks them out.
---
Blizzard has to put some sort of incentive in game to encourage transfers, beyond the reduced queues.  Game time, in game consumables, or something.  Hell, 100g for transferring your 60 would be enough to get people to jump without ruining any economy.
---
The reason you want windfury for pvp is simply this: burst damage kills people, consistent damage can be outhealed. Windfury gives you the ability to deathtouch cloth wearers as soon as it proccs. It's inconsistent, but so are crits. And crit is a great pvp stat because spikes in damage (and healing) are much more impactful than a steady increase. It's the same logic.  
---
Practically speaking, Rockbiter can be better depending on the matchup. Windfury just becomes better the fewer shots you have at touching someone and allows for less outplay potential.
---
yea starting at 1.12 is definitely "no changes"
---
Relevant [Rush Hour 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAVnOz7i-JA) bit
---
110 run, dropped twice lost twice.
---
Ugh, had that happen in SM Arm last night. We pulled Herod and some dumbass forgot to put down his WF totem so it didn't aggro the Myrmidons that spawn outside. Awesome group though, we switched targets, killed the Myrmidons, then killed Herod.
---
That dumbass was me...
---
Forgot about that. Good point.
---
imagine beong a rogue and farming people for 18 hours a day for 2-3 months for gear thats only marginally better untill AQ 40 comes out
---
My guess is that this was before damage meters? Not sure of the exact timing, but I assume when people *thought* they were doing awesomely, they needed the resist bc they were actually doing shit dmg.
---
I mean i was just trying to give a general guideline for warrior leveling but yeah weapon speed doesnt matter nearly as much until ww/ms
---
Not sure, I'm seeing the same time on both sites (4 days to reset).
---
There are logs with human warriors abover 1k on Rag using Thrash/Mirahs.  That weapon and pre raid combo are seriously underrated by most.
---
No it is utterly and absolutely not.
---
It is never required to sapphiron where EVERY person needs 200+ unbuffed
---
Most guilds take 1 shadow priest specifically for the shadow weaving buff that increases their warlocks damage by 15%
---
Congratulations!
---
I'm curious what sever you're on?
---
Yeah to this point we're full clearing stuff easily with 30 people... some not even 60... so I don't think my guildies care much at all.
---
The scepter of celebras, it’s a quest, you have to kill two bosses in the first part of the dungeon then get to celebras to make the staff
---
Warlocks claim that no one can beat them in a 1v1.
---
I have a 60 prot pally, over 5k gold and would still consider it a waste. My mirah’s song with fiery enchant or any other lvl 60 weapon will tank fine for 5 mans
---
Exactly this. Which is why I get so mad at loot whores in this game. There is basically no dps checks. Purple loot is just bonus gear in the current raids.
---
Bruh fishing is actually HARDER than I remember. I thought I'd at least be in the high 200s before things started slowing down. Feels like it's taking forever but maybe I just got too used to retail skills.
---
Meh, Most guilds i talk to do. On our server there's a pretty big friendly competition for speed clears. Carrying an arms prohibits quite a bit as they take up debuff slots and can't come close to out dpsing a fury.
---
&gt;abuse
---
Genuinely curious: your word choice suggests it's possibly exploitable but it's not clear what sort of exploit would be going on here.
---
I joined a 40 man pvp raid in Hillsbrad to test and change my settings with Healbot. Nothing beats a live test
---
Yes.
---
We, warlocks, loves shadow priests.
---
I used to love ST, I knew the order of that ring part, loved skinning, etc... Still haven't made it yet in Classic.
---
So I know this doesn't help your situation and before I say this I do wanna say I empathize with and dont mean this in a 'git gud lol' way but... if you dont wanna look at a grey screen type this into chat: 
---
/console ffxdeath 0 - this will get rid of the ghost effect.
---
Join a PvP guild that cares more about PvP than PvE perfection and they'll be happy to take a few Shadow Priests. Current content you can easily do MC/Ony in 2 hours or less with almost any raid makeup and of course dungeons are a non issue.
---
Obviously you have never played a warlock.  Especially now that trinket is out, if you can get a fear off before you die you're doing great.
---
everybody had some shadow resist for mother.
---
frost-nature in SSC was only for tank.
---
astromancer didnt require any resist set.
---
fire on illidan was only for tank.
---
what do you class as a dead server? Why not make a character and run to a main city and see what the trade chat or even check what the LFG channel is about?  Then you'll get a feel for whether is it good or not. 
---
But you're not going to find a server that you can happily go about and find wPvP thats fair and balanced. Just not happening.
---
Nice comeback. You still have no point.
---
Could be used the same way.  Could have a raid of Horde down in a lake, then spirit walk into Stockades to raid Stormwind.  It's not going to be a healthy addition to the game.
---
It's partially a joke because it's not an identical patch and there's some gear the makes it way easier. I'm interested to see how they handle AQ.
---
Faction imbalance isnt as relevant on a PVE server though.
---
I have suffer 3 ninjas looters from different lvls, gankings that last 2 hours each one, lost items with shitty dices, got stucked in different places when my fucking heartstone is on CD. Best. Fucking. Game. Ever.
---
Mage solo MC trash
---
thanks!!
---
ok snitch
---
*leaves group*
---
you are lowering your DPS, making the fight longer.
---
on stuff like Vael ( who else in BWL require FR?) that means more people  getting blown by bomb, making the fight overall harder.
---
it's just signs of overall bad raid leaders.
---
&gt; pretty big friendly competition for speed clears
---
Ya this ain't most guilds
---
Insanely hit or miss. 
---
Sometimes you'll pop off a triple WF crit and one shot somebody.
---
Other times you'll run around getting kited, hating life, and throwing out a ~450 damage auto attack every ~3.7 seconds.
---
Warlocks and priests are much better at doing this anyway.
---
Foreigner here, is it also hard for english natives to read this ?
---
Just did it last night and it took a long time but navigating it felt easier. I think it was just because our hunter was a great guide. I would have been lost for hours on my own, and back in the day when fewer people knew about it and there wasn't thorough guides, it was rough.
---
Aren’t you lucky... gz bro. You will make a lot of cash!
---
So, I shoot the boss and misdirect to who?
---
Exactly. 
---
No, that's what I'm asking. 
---
I misdirect to who?
---
Who is tanking the boss?
---
Right.
---
after #raidarea51 we're now at #raidrule7. They can't remove us all
---
The post above is making light of the fact that if this plan went through someone could remove there armor, kill there own character and then just walk into the instance without any player interaction.
---
Thank you for calling me out, I should have explained that more.
---
More like after phase 2
---
People are much less likely to start fresh if they have a high level character. People were always going to quit Classic for a number of reasons; in this case, the reason is poor planning. No reason to open up the flood gates to fix someone’s completely avoidable situation.
---
Good one! I play Horde on Stalagg and occasionally get ganked by an Alliance death squad when I'm riding solo and making no effort to prepare. Could easily happen once or twice a session!
---
Obviously, no faction imbalance problem on Stalagg! /s
---
I'm 30/0/21 and love it, but kind of miss elemental mastery for those sweet sweet double crit deletions.
---
the saddest thing is how these rules can be abused. And they always are. for whatever reason. some mods go so far that they even shadow mute your account. Smite sub is a good example of that...how less moding would actually make sub alive again, they are separating community by forbidding memes and such. and when people say the truth how it really is and how mods are abusing this...they just shadow mute their accounts. This cheapens everything we do. I'm not saying current wow sub mods do that, but it is not a good idea to even have a possibility of this happening.
---
Ho sorry you are on PVE server, so you can say whatever shit you want on PVP realm it must be right /s
---
Man it only proove you don't know what is happening on those server and still you are here explaining what people should do
---
This is not lag, looks like he’s teleporting away when ever you are facing him.
---
I think this got removed :(
---
Geared Warriors are extremely strong raw DPS, and highly sought after in raids. However, for dungeons, many tanks, myself included, avoid taking other Warriors because they bring no utility other than damage to my group, and compete with me for gear. Your life would be made much easier by being willing to tank dungeons, but you're free to play the game how you want.
---
Although it's probably better for an SM lock to put it up rather than a DS.
---
You should hold off on doing Argent Dawn quests until you are revered. Once you are at revered the only way to get rep is quests, scholo/strat bosses, and scourgestone turn ins. Before revered you get rep for killing mobs in WPL/EPL.
---
You can definitely make useful stuff while leveling, so keep it if you like! It’s not only about endgame content; during leveling I more often then not have multiple pieces that I crafted myself equipped. If you only spam instances to level I guess you have better gear from that but if you mainly quest or grind it’s helpful.
---
Also, try to look for recipes that ‘make money’. I for example made around 10G by just buying leather at the AH, crafting Hillman’s Shoulders and vendoring them for more money than the mats costed. I’m sure there are more of these recipes that you can look into, depending on your server economy.
---
Local temporary alterations to weapons, such as rockbiter, personally cast windfury, Frost oil, poisons, sharpening stones, caster oils, all stop windfury totem from applying it's buff to your weapon.
---
You would have to have the pendulum of doom at the very least
---
I don't use ElvUI, but issue 1 is almost certainly something in your settings. 
---
Not really sure what issue 2 is. Nameplates have a limited range, but maybe you just have them turned off on your second character? I believe the default keybind to toggle them is "V"
---
Ignore the asshat "haven't you been playing pservers for 20 years!? Noob"
---
Glad you learned some new inventory management.
---
Fortunately even urok is fearable, so lock can cc+damage
---
All these tastes and you have chosen to be salty.
---
If you have a decently large display you can get away with scaling down healbot rather than re-skinning it.
---
I regularly run 40 man raids with it.
---
That strikes me as far fetched until Blizzard removes dishonorable kills (and even then, you can already corpse run into Stockades with no armor on if the goal is to make some attack later). Capital city raids are basically non-existent now.
---
This is just how they are at 60. They are so strong while leveling everyone thinks they are Keanu shaman, but they just scale horribly at max level.
---
Erm lol
---
Idk man, and don't take this the wrong way, but if you struggle in wpvp as a lock you might just not be very good.
---
Lock is objectively the best 1v1 class in the game, they beat everything other than a rogue and if the rogue doesn't kill them in the opener lock wins that too.
---
I'd recommend watching some snutz duels if you struggle with open world 1v1s
---
Agree with this, man. It's such a zoomer mindset and I hate it.
---
15 years of Wow had taught me that both factions are the same... Until classic p2. The amount of alliance qq is sad to see.
---
Or just put up with it and stop bitching.
---
New to warrior. Hamstring spam is only viable as horde with windfury correct?
---
Ya if you're short on time and then handicap yourself by rolling an insanely slow leveling class don't bitch when people are ahead of you.
---
I appreciate the explanation. Thanks!
---
Aren't BG queues confirmed to be cross server?
---
Thank you for the information. I do occasionally pop off a storm-strike, WF crit hit but its rare and its the only thing keeping me going is when WF procs. I think ill attempt to try ele and pickup some gear off the AH and see how it feels.
---
It's easy when youre focused and doing the things you listed. But that's what makes it much harder still than modern MMOs where you can pull 7 quest mobs and faceroll 2 aoe abilities, or mindlessly grind a dungeon in 15 mins. No focus or self control required. Raids on high difficulty setting are the only aspect of the game that requires any amount of focus or knowledge nowadays.
---
My only gripe with it is that if I go to heal a player as he dies, I get stuck with the active spell on my cursor that I have to discard before I can continue healing with healbot.
---
Solo Mage gets world first Kel'thuzad
---
He was so close
---
Yea
---
&gt;Other times you'll run around getting kited, hating life, and throwing out a \~450 damage auto attack every \~3.7 seconds.
---
This sounds extremely accurate
---
I'm laughing so much at all the people before launch that were saying "PVE realms are for noobs and casuals, PVP is the way to go".
---
Have fun on your unplayable server.
---
I had a mage pay me to help him farm the pants.
---
The fuck bro we eat rogues for dinner
---
Highlight clips aren't the same as a tutorial video.
---
You don't get locked until you enter the instance.
---
Get 2 greater fire protection potions, use them on Rag.
---
Part of me think drastic measures like making it so dying automatically gives you honorless target would be a good idea at this point.
---
"You think you want it..."
---
Gold sinks is the best argument. 
---
Personally I'd love to have dual specs, so I could actually PvP and raid without blowing hundreds of gold, but that's just how things are. Makes your choices meaningful and makes economic management important.
---
 Where are you getting those numbers from?  I play Horde on Bigglesworth and been completely locked out of game play since hitting 50 by ally campers. Does feel like Horde are the dominant faction.
---
I trade morrowgrain for elf rep and random potions, so it saves me taking a boat, then I can fish in moonglade/azshara.
---
Unpopular opinion time, the way things are right now is perfectly fine. BG’s will be out soon and the gank squads will lessen, it’s ok to have a temporary period of time where chaos is everywhere.
---
Dungeons won't be a problem. Raids, I'm not sure, but I would think most groups doing Ony/MC can do it without being hyper strict on raid makeup (I could be wrong, and obviously a weak group will need to worry about makeup).
---
You can always go holy/disc.
---
because blizz realized resist check are stupid, but instead of totally removing them ( like they did after WoTLK Naxx) they put some well-itemized crafted item available to every blacksmith / tailor / LW... instead of the classic situation where your FR gear is likely a hodgepodge of mismatched items... aka maraudon trinket for NR.
---
&gt;Leveling is one of the best parts of vanilla/classic.  
---
When done one time - yes. On third character it's become very boring.  
---
Leveling fourth character on new server without gold - it's like hell.
---
Incorrect. 5 runs of zf per hour to lockout is 40-60 gph. At lvl 45 and at lvl 60. Same thing. Still 5 runs per lockout.
---
Their damage isn’t good, they go oom quickly, and need too many debuff slots and the game is  melee focuses that the SW buff adds so little damage that you’d be better off taking almost any other dps than a shadow priest. 
---
But stuff is so easy it doesn’t matter. Guilds run enhance shams feed them gear and they finish bottom 5 dps but they still clear MC without issue. The PvE is such a joke you could literally run 2 tanks, 10 healers and ANY dps that knew what they were doing and still clear MC with ease. 
---
Balance Druid is playable, doesn’t mean good but it’s a game, just keep asking guilds till they say ok
---
I would  /spit again
---
That do sound like fun
---
Because it negates the choice of spec, and games are essentially a series of interesting choices. When you take away the "interest" from a choice, you might as well take the choice out of the game.
---
I have to smoke my pot in stealth
---
It's not a bad thing people are just purists

I raided through almost all BC content at 15-20 FPS, Some fights like teron gorefiend were downright impossible with FPS that low, the time it would take me to die and respawn and get a useable cast bar was roughly 10 seconds. WOTLK my computer was too bad to even raid, in Cata I was gifted an old pc from a friend that allowed me to "raid" at 30 fps and somehow I managed to down heroic rag and deathwing (dodging World in flames at 30 fps is something else let me tell you). Most of my difficulty in raiding came solely from trying to balance addons/settings/FPS and having to learn to preemptively do things.
---
Now that i'm older and have some of the best hardware you can throw into a PC the whole idea of "hardcore raiding" doesn't really appeal to me but what raiding i've done is like night and day, I don't have to try to guess where fires are because the effects are hardly visible, I don't have to turn and adjust my camera so I get the best FPS. The game definitely lost a little bit of its charm when I upgraded, and a ton of its difficulty.
---
Ew you give that traitor Staghelm morrowgrain for his "research"?
---
Wow, you're toxic. 
---
Welcome to the Horde :)
---
Get into a 4 vs 6 fight and you’ll see just how one sided that is.
---
Definitely would be frustrating to run a raid, see a piece of healing gear drop, and then have someone able to roll on it who wasn’t healing at all because it is their second spec. A lot of items are super rare and in my opinion, it’s really not fair to give folks and equal shot at them if they are not preforming the role the item is used for. That’s my take on being against dual specs.
---
1 arcane crystal per loop... how many rich thoriums are you getting and how fucking lucky are you. I do a full loop and get maybe 4-5 nodes per.
---
Currently lvl 49 and still don’t have First Aid on my Undead Warlock. Been saving all my mats for Tailoring
---
I mean, that's probably how it will turn out.
---
yeah but it was mail :(
---
Is there an addon that can highlight items required for collection quests?
---
What is the mage.
---
Winning team joiner?
---
I find this to be a quality shit post.
---
It's not a bad thing. It's just a retail thing.
---
People have gotten used to playing with dual specializations over the last 10 years. Many players have spent much more time playing with them than without them.
---
Sure, dual specs make it easier to become a more versatile player, but it takes away from your character's identity.
---
But at least we have the talent trees back and are able to make hybrid specs once again.
---
Playing fury with BRE is going to outdps basically every single combination of dualwielding except optimal raid weapons, so...
---
I remember being level 20something and BEGGING some level 60 in ironforge for 1g to buy a Gizmotron Megachopper sword from the auction house. I begged and he finally gave me the ONE gold with the stipulation that I pay him back. I absolutely could not for the life of me pay back the *huge* loan of 1g. He whispered me from time to time asking if I had it, but I think he knew I was a kid at the time and I couldn't pay him back, so he kept asking just because it was more amusing to him than anything.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I'll keep poking around re: #1.
---
For #2, it's good to know that small mobs don't have nameplates. The Stratholme guys were the first ones I noticed, but I was recently trying ot kill Solenor the Slayer and his bugs didn't have nameplates. In a video I watched on YouTube, the guy had nameplates on those mobs.
---
I did confirm I have enemy nameplates turned on via the keybind.
---
Appreciate your time! Hopefully can find someone who uses ElvUI :)
---
then those warlocks have fought a good rogue
---
Do you have enemy nameplates on on character 2?
---
Re number 1 you need 'realmobhealth' add-on and it j tegrates with elv UI. Without that the health is just '100', hence 93-93% etc
---
Surely you can't be serious? I am serious, and stop calling me Shirley!
---
Rogue is awesome but both Warriors and Rogues are very weapon/gear dependant and tank all damage with their own face so theyre generally abit slower to level and powerful late game.
---
You mean WoTLK? TBC didn't have it afaik.
---
Okay well you continue to provide no reasoning for your stance so I’m just going to continue to disagree.  You can’t win an argument by repetition.
---
Plenty of people use the +33 Healing bracers at this point in the game. If there was bracers giving a flat +41 Int, you better believe I’d use them. But you are saying that the healing is better “in a heartbeat”.
---
This !!! This is the only relevant comment on why we should NOT have Dual specc
---
IDC for changes but main reason is its the only Way to easy remove gold from economy to stop inflation. With like repairs and byuing at vendors
---
All this transferring back and forth reminds me of how traffic jams are created.

I’m from Blaumeux and we used to be 50/50 too, now it’s approaching 70/30 H/A. Everyone’s trying to weave in and out to try and outsmart the faction imbalance but all they’re doing is fucking up other lanes
---
To expand, 2h fury only works for horde because you can fish for windfury procs by spamming hamstring.
---
For alliance, you don't really get anything from being 2h over dw.
---
Yeah I tried turning them off and on again. I will certain re-re-confirm though when I"m back on.
---
Do you have to separately download/install the RealMobHealth addon? It's not built-in to ElvUI by default? That could definitely be the issue if you need to separately install the addon...
---
That’s my problem too.  The only reason I’m on a PvP server is because that was the only one you could log into for the first several days.
---
Currently yes it's viable. I am a pve spriest and perform very well. A few weeks ago on rag I was at 500 dps, and dropped down to about 390. Would have been 415 ish if I didn't get knocked around twice. There are some fights that just suck for us though.
---
The problem is every single server, minus one, is horde 2:1 ratios.
---
So there's way more Horde dicks then Ally dicks. Like, 50% more.
---
Humans are puny, weak creatures. Don’t get me started on dwarves and gnomes...
---
I fancy a hunter
---
Not sure about highlighting,  but questie will give you map markers where items/mobs spawn for quests you're on.  Makes route planning very efficient.
---
Yeah, but Horde are more better dicks...
---
That doesn’t defeat the point that most guilds would hand BRE out as a pvp weapon.
---
Well depends on your raid, if some of your dps need to truly manage their threat. Then give this to a tank to fury/prot with and threat will no longer be an issue. Thus your dps will be able to go all out, increasing the whole raids efficiency. While I play rogue and want this weapon myself very badly, if it goes to a MT it is also alright.
---
From now on, this will be one of my favorite things
---
I took a shot at it but my odds seem too astronomical to be correct.
---
Similar to the birthday problem, you can calculate the odds that nobody shares the same roll (Assuming 40 man raid): 1x0.99x0.98x0.97x0.96x....x0.61. Then subtract these odds from 1 to get the odds any 2 people share a number which is 0.9998878.
---
Then the odds of this being the highest number among 38 other numbers (multiply by 1/39)
---
Then I multiplied by 1/10000 twice to account for the next 2 identical rolls.
---
I don't think this is right because I got odds around 1 in 4 billion lmao.
---
I used to be in favor of adding dual spec (at a cost, like 1k gold) ... but someone made a good point. One of the nice things about dedicating yourself to PvP or PvE is that anyone dedicated to the other cant just waltz right in and compete with you without paying a heavy price.
---
&gt;and apparently secondary professions
---
Fishing definitely does. I remember going to Nat Pagle as soon as I reached 225 Fishing. I was not happy.
---
There is one but I can’t remember the name. 
---
It also outlines greens blues epics which helps a ton
---
Seems alright. U might want to look into some fire res tho. Mainly u just need a lot of ppl to clear mc.
---
Please master, tell us how to outplay 3:1 odds.
---
Your guild sounds like no fun.
---
Yeah that’s fucked up. Is he gonna roll on BB/viskags too
---
Pretty much.
---
Why is OEB better than BRE for horde? Obviously OEB is super powerful but that surprises me.
---
It is not built in
---
I feel people forgot what Vanilla actually was and want to blame classic for their nostalgia glasses. I'm sorry OP is not having fun, but this is exactly what I expected from world PVP.
---
Fury warriors are objectively better so they should get it first.
---
But otherwise, I'd probably push the fury wars to go 2h fury while you get the rogues their weapons.
---
I’m only referring to when you’re raiding as a warlock, which is a lot of SB spam. Please don’t tell me you death coil, shadow burn, pass out healthstones, and ss while in a raid boss encounter
---
Lets be real You is healing
---
The root problem is too high server populations. Lower that a bit, set the cap for each faction at a reasonable number, and allow server transfers for the majority faction. It's pretty easy
---
Gold sinks and character identity.
---
I wouldn't even need a 2nd spec anyway though.
---
Awesome xD
---
How much did you pay for them on average? My guild does 20m splits and one group pays ~120g and the other keeps it around 60g. I'm so jealous of the other group.
---
Because you can get mana by spamming pots and runes. 
---
SP is a bottleneck stat you cant easily get more from consumes
---
K
---
I said restorative in response to the guy saying he's gonna get sheeped. You can't counter poly with a FAP, it'll go to waste. If you're pretty sure he'll sheep you, it's better to use a restorative, but otherwise if you want to burst someone down, yes, use a FAP. But you may get sheeped. Or he'll use block and you waste your potion for the fight. Restorative prevents this.
---
'free' frost oil and elixirs of dream vision while I grind the Brute Force recipe are worth supplying an elf with 'strange smelling grass'
---
Dagger rogues followed by whoever at that point imo. Dagger rogues for obvious reasons but beyond that you're just likely to cause loot drama. Let people roll for MS after that.
---
aye, thats correct...it was a long time ago, and this old head forgets sometimes :D
---
Okay so spirit is better ? I have a lot of spirit on my int gear too, they seem to come together on a lot of things, but I will look out for that as well now. Super good to know thank you so much . Crit isn’t something I ever see in pieces, will I eventually or is it something I need to figure out ?
---
C'mon over to Heartseeker. You'll see Alliance act the exact same way - the majority faction always does.
---
Maybe they want the shiny Items you get for having high Ranks, only a guess though.
---
ROFL
---
You can choose to do whatever you want with the weapon, but saying "playing a sub optimal spec" is incredibly wrong.
---
Doesn’t help that he wasn’t capitalizing your name.
---
Ban this dude...he has spy
---
Yes? You do realize that you get almost two swings for every one 2h swing and a guaranteed two for your off hand, right? As well as AOTD proc and if you have devilsaur even better.
---
The way I see it is, if you can force a mage to double ice block, you've already won.
---
It is sub optimal without BRE (which he doesn’t have). Pre bis 2H will never beat out DW. ITS INCREDIBLY RIGBT.
---
I went back to EM last night and my god it’s so much more fun to have a insta kill button in PVP. If you have another strong healer in your group take that best burst damage in the game to the next level. It’s so much fun.
---
which sucks when your always group 5+ and the master looter can't roll above a 20
---
Except they don't owe anyone else anything and can choose when and if they want to try and do something about it.
---
ah of course. How could I forget
---
You is a common Rocket League name.
---
A good SL warlock will beat a rogue most times
---
Dualwield non human tanks lol. Also that staff sucks. If your hunters are using it they're wrong
---
Dungeons.  I've leveled from 53 to 58 doing literally nothing but BRD
---
I found a Shadowfang (level 19 twink BIS) last night. What are people thinking about the twink markets? I know the very serious people already have their items, but do we expect a bump after WSG launches from the more casual players who get in to twinking? I just am not sure if I should hold this until a later phase or take my mini windfall now.
---
You mean people play video games for fun ? /s...
---
IM YOU! YOU IS ME!
---
Yup don't mess with that it doesn't change how fast you can do anything, it's just the window of time you can client side que your next gcd usage, people are stupid.
---
Thank you for introducing me to this marvel of entertainment.
---
Blessing of freedom into hoj after blink will force an ice block. After that, I guess you just try to bait them out of the first ice block with a fake heal. If they miss cs you can just force another ice block with cleanse on roots. If they have imp cs, I'd bubble rather than take a full shatter combo. Alternatively you can holy light while they're casting shatter combo to instantly heal it up once the crits hit (assuming you made them miss cs).
---
For rogues, they can't break hoj stun so dps hard and get them on the back foot. Consecrate on top of them as hoj is breaking. This will force blind when vanish breaks maybe, unless they gouge.
---
It really depends on what kind of resets they get.

Rogues get stomped by warriors and locks,

I wrote a whole big post but it's really not worth the time, this stuff should be incredibly obvious.

Sorry, quickly posted this this morning when half asleep. I didn't watch the video and thought it was about the first Diremaul North boss for some reason.
---
2h. You want pendulum of doom. Just a heads up you’re likely going to be paying 2000 gold or so total for this twink. That axe happens to be one of the rarer and more expensive items in the game. Check your AH and if it’s listed under 1000g try and scoop it up ASAP and consider it a good deal. If it’s even listed at all.
---
49 warriors are much better in their respective bracket with MS, plate, and the extra 5% Crit from fury talents. And happen to be ~1000 gold cheaper than 39 warriors
---
The last two items give crit chance but no hit. Then having less hit and having to make up for it with other gear then makes that gear have to be worse. For example Black Dragonscale Boots are better than the bloodmail as well as the black dragonscale legs are better than eldritch legs. Of course the other two have some agility so some argument can be had for them.
---
If I did not have the hit from the dragonscale set I'd have to replace it with one of the many items listed above. I have lionheart + dragonscale but if I had not the hit from that and was using, say, those boots. I'd then be losing some damage to make up for hit. Same with blackstine ring vs having both magnis will and painweaver band. Mark of fording &gt; Ony neck as well. 
---
Overall it's just different play I suppose. At the end of the day we are meme spec and we play because we like the class so I don't mean to say "i'm right you're wrong".
---
Didn’t mean to be hurtful, just pointing out facts
---
its either that or those people will quit. so in the end the same result..
---
&gt;level 1
---
Is a hunter or mage better at farming gold?
---
I meant raiding. If you only take during encounters, take out the stones. All else stayes. Even banish on Garr. And yes I use coil and shadowburn on bosses, why wouldn't I?
---
Imagine being triggered and going through someone's comments cuz someone dared to talk bad about blizzard
---
I think priests are equal, maybe better. Depends what you want, a bunch of killing blows and top damage - hunter. You want to never die and support everyone - priest.
---
I had a twink hunter with the best possible set up, only thing that could kill me was a priest, you just can't do enough damage to them solo, it takes 2-3 twinks to take down a single twink priest.
---
Farming my Dal Rend's Sacred Charge for the last month+, getting pretty efficient at leading Jed/Rend runs.

"I've been here plenty of times I know what to do"

I guess they just like wiping groups.

Trying to plan the guild for the future. Just trying to get an understanding of how many healers we will need to bring into BWL. Or what a BWL raid comp should look like.
---
Alright well, this dialog went about as well as I expected it too. Keep blaming everyone else for your problems. I'm not entirely sure what you're implying, this is the only conversation I've had with you and with some luck it'll be the last. Stay salty.
---
I have no clue what it all mean. Im warrior. I have tank set, i have dps set. I go to raid as dps so i have to tank 5 ppl in crapy raid dps spec. But i still TANK. I do not play as no brain dps dolly. Since it is very difficult to get to 5 ppl as dps due to lack of tanks. Or reverse - imagine i am MT in my guild in Fury prot spec. And i would go dps to 5 ppl in crapy fury prot. But i still can do raid dps, raid tanking and eve PVP. I have brains and skills for it. We arenot 15 years back when nooby players needed to focus on one spec in order to play it properly. And even if they focused properly that time was not so proper. crapy stupis identity argument.
---
 I friend of mine had an awesome name that actually only work in French.
---
He was a tank named Mankhul, and when the raid leader screamed out loud : heal Mankhul, heal Mankhul. The whole raid was laghting off.
---
Because it exactly sound as the RL was saying  "He fuck me from behind" repeatedly.
---
Idk that doesn't seem crazy to me if you actually spend time farming which they say they do. assuming say 30g/hr thats only 70 hours of farming of the 120 he has at 60
---
I really miss Layering, on my Server the road between 57-60 feels like an endless one. I found myself farming leather for a whole level in Un'Goro, questing was out of the question every questhub is just run over.
---
Did you miss the duel tournament?
---
Most of the time the higher level brackets are fun because you have almost your full kit available.  Warriors that is only the case in the 49 bracket. 
---
At 39 you have rend,slam,whirlwind and heroic strike. Not enough of a toolkit.  You will be free honor to other twinks. You’ll probably be fine against non twinks though.
---
You know dual spec cost like 1000 gold initially right?
---
BGs will help if the servers are linked in some way to ease queues. They are by and large the fastest way to farm honor.
---
Yes any class can do it, however one of the jumps is hard without 60% mount
---
I do fine with Mirah's song MH and Dal'rend offhand.  Make sure you still have hit gear in your tanking gear.  For scholo I pretty much only put on a shield for the ravager's, strat for the black guard at the end and the ghoul packs, and UBRS the pulls with assassins, or multiple of the melee dragons.  Basically if it hits stupid hard put on a shield.  If its alot of magic damage, or they just don't hit so hard keep DW'ing for rage to dump into threat.
---
Exactly! Which is why I don‘t see a reason why Blizzard shouldn’t enable the option.
---
So 2H wep is best. Going for nightblade thoe then
---
What level do Paladins get bubble hearth? That’s all I see them do.
---
Chillwind camp is a fp in wpl if you're alliance
---
Pffff lmao that's hilarious
---
No its really not. You are over exaggerating. Some zones are actually completely dead just like normal.
---
That’s not how it works, lol. Everyone still has a MS &gt; OS, even with dual spec
---
At least he doesnt have a bigger "sword" than you.
---
check out mister human compass over here...
---
You think you do, but...
---
Just do what I did and switch to dungeon runs only. BRD to 55 and LBRS to 58. Then all the rest. Start your own group and offer 5g-10g for the tank. You’ll easily make that money back in drops.
---
Might be hard to say at this point. 
---
The requirements for a private server try hard guild will be different than your average guild and comparing peoples memories of 15 years ago to the current meta will be tough.
---
I think its been answered but just incase. In classic, mob health is not something available in the game. The addon "realmobhealth" will help though. Read the details on it though. Turning it on doesn't just flip the switch and show mob health. It calculates health based on damage dealt. 
---
For example, if a mob has 2 health and you auto it for 1 damage and the crit for 2. The addon will most likely register that mob as having 3 hp. Killing more mobs of the same type and level fine tunes the addon to get a more accurate reading. It takes time to build the addon basically.
---
If you care as much as you say you do about raid dps, this goes to someone willing to spec 2h fury, not arms, which means it isn't designated a pvp weapon.
---
As for dualwielding versus 2h, yes, obviously assuming equal tier weapons dualwielding is better, but guess what? YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE EQUAL TIER WEAPONS. 2H fury with a good 2hander is going to be most dualwielding setups that don't have something like rends or krol blade.
---
Why would it be too late?
---
No you.
---
Love this one \^. Saves so much time.
---
But.... Realm transfers were definitely a thing in vanilla, both free and paid ones. If you're so for #nochanges then maybe complain about the fact that servers are far more overcrowded in classic than they were in vanilla instead of changes that would make the game playable again for lots of people.
---
Warrior is the worst class to pick for 30-39 bracket
---
I don’t know why lower level characters get even saltier than level 60s about rolls. Folks are gonna get upset when they don’t win, I say shake it off and enjoy your new loots
---
Did you leave Flamelash because of overpopulation or because of the balance? It doesn’t feel super full to me, although I think Horde is heavily favored in numbers
---
right like i find it hard to believe that you would really ever need more than 10 healers. but its possible.
---
yeah about the rogues, notice how i’m still level 50 as they are 50ish and i think none of them is playing prep spec, they all are combat thus i can deal with them i guess i don’t expect the same results against a prep rogue
---
So wait - these Blizzard GMs won't do literally ANYTHING else with regards to tickets, problems, issues, etc - but they will do this because of a handful of rich kid whiners? Wow FUCK you Blizzard.
---
The part where you said raids on both sides. That's the problem. There are raids on one side right now. Not both.
---
This is the best name I have ever seen.
---
Going off of data from warcraftlogs(meaning only raiding 60's who are accounted for on the logs), its 70/30.
---
Surprised people are allowed that name honestly.
---
I wish they would change the way ony buff worked. I'm 100% for no changes, but creating megaservers with megaguilds was a massive change that made it so difficult to get ony head buff. I wish they'd greatly decrease the CD to compensate and help avoid situations like these.
---
BiS gear includes a whole bunch of +hit and +spell power. 
---
When MC opened originally, half your gear or more was often just the crumby class set.
---
Can you? Yes. But you'll be in the same bucket as every other DPS class struggling to find dungeon groups because of a tank shortage.  If you keep a shield in your bag and understand the basics of tanking, you can handle every dungeon until your 50s with just dps talents.
---
Murlocparliament has a grid2 guide if you like that raid frame addon.
---
Well, "OC" but yeah.
---
&gt; No You.

Then they deserve no sympathy when they are interfering with a far greater number of players than their simple 1. If they don’t owe anyone else, they are owed nothing as well.

Believing in good game mechanics doesn't make you a purist.
---
yep, only way a rogue takes down a SL lock is not via stun lock, it has do some straight trickery depending on the pet.
---
i don’t really get the whole bubble hs thing since hs is on global cooldown with 10 sec cast and bubble lasts 10 sec so if you hit them the last second of the hs casting the bubble has already faded thus breaks his hs
---
"Seems weird" isn't an argument. "Problems could arise from solutions" is not an argument against solutions, specially when those problems are so flimsy.
---
"It wasn't worth doing" is a cost-benefit analysis that often results in a lot of things that players don't want and don't like, like the in-game shop on retail. Scam insurance is essential to an MMO with a trading system that enables it, which is precisely why they did it.
---
What you're saying is "they got greedy and wanted to increase their profit margins and they did so by cutting customer support for non-vital issues" which is honestly a realistic argument, but a terrible one from a PR perspective, hence this shitstorm, which they absolutely deserve. Some things they just should be doing, this is one of them.
---
My server has both "Everybody" and "Nobody". It was very interesting doing a city raid with them.
---
"Nobody has aggro!"  
---
"Heal everybody!"
---
If its a rogue, they probably dont have enough HP to be alive after eviscerate.
---
This.
---
&gt;All of these factors combined are going to make it extremely difficult for anyone on even a slightly more casual gaming schedule to compete at all in open world PvP unless you vastly out number them. Even if you kill them once or twice, once your group moves on they will be back to hard camping everyone they possibly can for honor. **It's going to be a very frustrating experience for anyone in these zones actively trying to accomplish anything, whether you're still leveling at this point in the server, or a level 60 who's trying to farm.**
---
The yard reduction isn't the big issue, what was the big nerf was it no longer shows when someone in range has a buff active. It only shows when someone uses a skill. So previously it would show almost everyone near you merely if they had any sort of aura active. Now you can have people running right next to you and they won't show up unless they stop and actively use a skill.
---
It's been massively nerfed. I preferred it before.
---
vanilla mc was way harder than classic because everyone was bad at vanilla
---
&gt;It is... I know the first +5 is roughly 3% hit. After that i just think another +5 is 2%?
---
I'm not talking about how much +hit you get from skill, I'm talking about how much dps I will get for 1% more hit at 6% hit rating as orc with axes, as opposed to, say, 20 attack power more. 
---
I'm looking for the dps value of each individual stat at all relevant levels of hit rating.
---
His fault for not rolling orc he would have resisted both cheap shots at least
---
Yes thats true. Especially right now before BGs come out it can take upwards of 45 mins to corpse run into DM E due to roaming death squads on the road and raids camping the entrance. It is only really efficient once you actually get inside. I think it will be a lot faster when BGs come out
---
this is an example of how kiting isnt an option when the rogue gets the complete drop on you.
---
There was PvP to PvE transfer in Vanilla.
---
For dungeons I prefer feral druids, but at endgame when tanks are going to go prot they become better tanks. And you will lvl as cat so it's good dps.
---
Woot I got mine early his morning
---
Same, that's why we didnt waste time and beat it the first month
---
Yes in fact a shadow priest in a raid with a decent amount of locks is quite insane as you boost all the locks there dmg.
---
Rogues will be your best match up for sure.
---
Warriors you should also have the upperhand, depending on some factors here and there.
---
Druids will more than likely not engage you because it's a fight that can go either way, and if you use all your cooldowns appropriately you can win this fight, or at least sustain for a long enough time that you might get lucky with a random alliance passerby to come lend a hand.
---
Mages and Locks and pretty much any caster class will give you trouble.
---
Hunters will give you an insanely hard time, don't even bother. They will viper sting the ever living hell out of you and kite you until eternity.
---
Shaman is gonna be another tough one, especially if they are elemental. Try to bait out their purges with using rank 1 seals and blessings to make them waste their mana.
---
In all honestly, you won't have the easiest time in world pvp as a paladin, it's just not where their strengths lie. Unless of course you do some kind of a gimmic with crazy 15-1hr cooldown items.
---
zeroji and amphy on youtube
---
Giving up is one option. Alternatively you can take initiative and do what I did:
---
1) go get an UBRS key
---
2) organize and lead the raid groups
---
Other people are lazy too and want someone else to lead. Step up and fill the gap.
---
Asmongold has been calling for his ban for a few days now.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Aniat924o
---
Who?
---
I levelled a hunter because my resto druid can't do shit
---
Notice how Drizee Cheated with question marks right before winning the roll. That has to be it... ;)
---
Because it used to show anyone who had a buff/aura active on their character even if it had been casted a while ago. Now, it only shows people who have actively used a skill while within the reduced 50y range.
---
So it's the functionality that changed, not just the distance.
---
Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Besides the obvious abuse , this just kills world pvp completely.
---
If youre holding blackrock and wipe an enemy group, now instead of knowing where they spawn, they are going to zone into ubrs or MC or brd and attack from another angle or just run away for free.
---
Thinking that completely gutting world pvp is a solution just shows yoy dont know jack shit about pvp. The focus on a way to get into instances easily makes me think you are a pve player stuck on a pvp server. You clearly dont care about pvp at all to suggest this.
---
Oooo that’s a good idea, thanks!
---
Enhancement is a bit like a nightclub, it can be fun on occasion if you're drunk or if you get lucky, but otherwise it kind of sucks.
---
If you get lucky with WF procs you can delete most non-plate stuff, but you can also be kited to death or just not get any WF. Very variable.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I'm also 98% sure that the Xp-&gt;gold conversion for turning in quests at 60 wasn't in the game at the start.  I got my epic mount a few days after hitting 60 just by doing dungeon quests.  Absolutely zero gold farming.
---
oh i see then
---
Or that the other faction leaving will negatively impact their honor farm. Just imagine the boredom, camping the FP for only one or two players to show up for the entire evening!
---
Yeah enhancement shaman is legitimately one of the worst PvP specs in the game. Sorry.
---
If it's not against the rules of the game it shouldn't violate twitch rules.
---
Blizzard has no problem with the behaviour else he would be banned already there. Why does twitch seem to think they can make rules for Blizzard.
---
I hope he doesn't stop because of this :(
---
I how he just switched to mixer
---
"capital City raids are basically non existent now"
---
I can't tell if you're being serious. Try playing horde on Heartseeker, there's often more lvl60 alliance in Org than we have in a zone.
---
Although I agree with you on your first statement, they are within their rights to ban whoever they want according to their TOS. As much as I hate Asmon, he was clearly getting stream sniped.
---
Biggest reasoning why my guild uses a loot council. If it's an upgrade it's an upgrade.

---
Where are the mobs for that? i forget
---
I annhiliate rogues regularly on my shadow priest.
---
Entirely depends on how much vanilla experience the pug players have and how effective the raid leader is (and how geared the tanks are). But my hunch is that pugs will finally hit a glass ceiling at BWL as they wont be using gear outmatched for the instance anymore.
---
Is it "allies are going to quit the game"?
---
Our astromancer strat had 2 arcane resist tanks bounce the dot back and forth
---
i actually didnt know what the original one was, i've seen a lot of adaptations over the years, the first time i saw one of them was from a danish comedy trio named "Linie 3"
---
Greater Blessing of Kings is actually the highest threat generating ability in the game, provided enough people, because of this.  The threat generated is 60x1.9 for each class buffed - so if you have 10 of one class in a raid and you're spamming GBoK, you're generating 1,140 threat per global.  By comparison, a Sunder Armor only generates 261 threat.
---
It was so frustrating to watch
---
Then why would they be doing BWL attunement? I love a good circlejerk as much as the next guy, but you guys are contradicting each other
---
the early bird gets the stupid fucking reddit cliche
---
Hence why i said sub 3 minute fights. But currently he's not right. When you start adding up everything, spriest dominate pve. GRanted you can;t bring 20 of them and be successful, 1 is enough. It also depends on locks having 3 locks or more is almost a need. You have to look at the fights through damage, not dps.
---
Yeah I am definitely not in a rush and I wan to enjoy it too.
---
And from what I have heard I can go arms until the 50s or so and still tank correct?
---
Stream sniping being against ToS is still hilarious to me. Hey I'm broadcasting my gameplay but don't look! Twitch is a joke.
---
Yeah but seriously the masses have to wait for *one* raider to get a 2H over them before they can get their PVP gear. Doesn't seem like a big issue at all to most guilds. If animosity was brewing I'd argue that's  a personal problem rather than the process itself. The same people getting upset are the ones who are first in line for their PVE purples... have to compromise somehow.
---
As much as I enjoyed Advertise, I can't say that I'm overly surprised this happened.
---
 this attitude helps no one.

This was petty indeed, I ask a question and you see it as a witty blame while taking it too personally when I kill myself telling you I'm having fun with my friends.

---
&gt; You're wrong about those ghosts though. If they're the only undead they should be shackled to start and killed last, they're a major pita.
---
From my experience it is significantly easier to kill the ghost first, you can usually get them down before they split by stunning them a couple seconds into the pull. By then the casters have taken enough consecrate damage that they are fully locked down &amp; your dps can go ham. If you go oom at that point it doesnt matter because they are all yours till they die.
---
If you kill the casters first you then have to have enough mana to overcome on the ghost, which is not a given. 
---
Then you have to worry about patrols and other fuckery while low on mana.
---
Ghost first. Every time.
---
first aid is OP on warlocks, its basically full mana every minute, basically no downtime
---
I'm trying to see your gear. I wanna get some more gear sets working for fights.
---
That is a thing, unfortunately it is at the spirit healer
---
For alliance 2handed dps is never gonna compete with 2 dw fury. It’s a PvP weapon or 5 man weapon
---
That video of Perplexity beating that aq40 geared SL lock is insane, just the sheer amount of stuff he has to do to win.
---
Don't care
---
More like USA vs everyone else that speaks English.
---
I found the same thing you did.
---
I figured I'd give it a couple episodes to try and figure out what the big deal was. Maybe it was full of double meanings and innuendos like Rocko's Modern Life or whatever, but it was basically Carebears with hooves. 
---
I don't get it, not even a little.
---
I do that sometimes. Instead of going for the fast kill i'll play for a bit and try to cc as long as possible or run through caster so they can't get a cast off or let them heal to full again.
---
It only works if people are really bad. I've even died a few times because i did that but eh, its fun.
---
You must be a rogue.
---
Even then, if the lock has cool downs he’ll just spawn a new pet instantly
---
Do we have clearance Clarence?
---
Yep fort works fine but when I joined some people for a low level quest I couldn't shield them without pulling out my spellbook.
---
Im not opposed to shackling but dont do it to the ghost who I put a skull on and dont do it as a pull.
---
Yeah, i did!! :D
---
Respeccing affect every class somewhat equal honestly 
---
Mage aoe farm / raid pve / pvp specc
---
Rogue sword pve / daggger pvp 
---
Warlock pvp / pve all the time 
---
Warrior tank / dps 
---
Hunter ?? Maybe no respeccs 
---
Priest heal / Shadow 
---
Shaman Well Ele / enh resto 
---
Druid same as shaman yolo respecc all the time 
---
The point im trying to make is all classes actually respecc alot to be usefull. And the argument a mage Can raid and farm in same specc is true if u wanna use farm specc for raiding and be lowest performing mage in your guild. And if u are in any form lf serious guild that wouldnt be allowed.
---
So classes who have worst farm possibilities dont need to respecc more than those who have. 
---
Except hunter because hunter need something going for once
---
Could it be possibly done with 2 frost mages CC while tank get heal ?
---
I was a vanilla ret paladin and I am doing it again in classic.  I had a great time.  1v1 is all timing and strategy but were we shine is teams and holding cap points.  Also engineering helps add more tricks.  Biggest challenge in vanilla was getting my guild to allow pally to the big weapons over the warriors.  Pain in my ass.
---
Yeah. I would never use my banish to pull unless my tank specifically told me to.
---
Adapt how?
---
I just spent 30 minutes running to Dire Maul because there were 20 horde camping the entrance. So by adapt you mean gather an entire raid group of people every time I want to get into Dire Maul?
---
Because if you're going for server first you don't have time to wait for 40 people to get the attunement
---
Even then, it doesn't compare to practically any of the gathering professions.  Bags sell for less than the material cost usually.  "In-demand" stuff like dreamweave will have enough competitors on the AH to linger there and eat up deposit costs.  The only gear that I ever really made any gold from were the Felcloth pieces because they require BoP Demonic Runes.  The 4 day mooncloth cooldown is worth about 10g, which can be earned in 15 minutes from picking flowers.
---
Most of the clothies in my guild leveled to 300 to craft their Truefaith/Archmage/Robe of the Void and then dropped the profession for something more valuable.  Those robes *are* stellar though, and quite worth the investment if you've been passively leveling tailoring alongside the grind to 60.
---
you are 100% correct.
---
Very little honor in raids...best is to lvl in zone slightly under and solo or duo every horde
---
Did you just have a stroke or something?
---
Advertise really made asmon show his true colors.
---
I don’t know what’s better. The original post  even considering that it might work. or people taking the time to break down why it won’t work.
---
Do you even play classic?
---
this sub is weenie hut jr
---
But we do have all the cake and we can eat it. That's why we have all these servers to choose from, it's great isn't it?
---
I did want it banned, I didn't want blizz to take the easy way out and do what they did. But I am part of the minority and that alright.
---
This discussion confirms I'm the minority at least.
---
And of you call this a cringy outrage, I'm not sure you are spending a lot of time on reddit. It's a pretty calm post. But then again, it's your opinion of he post and that fine.
---
What as the reason for PVE servers characters unable to transfer to pvp servers?
---
It doesnt matter that youve had shit sinew luck. Anyone can farm carapace spine in 1 day. If you take strikers, your going to replace it within a month or 2 at the very latest. The melee wont replace for like a year or more. Strikers is way more rare than the hunter bow. Dont be a piece of shit and steal a bow you coyld upgrafe in a dungeon.
---
Layering was halfway there already. A bit of cleverness with restricting layer transitions would have let them do the same thing with more or less complete user transparency.
---
This is what I was thinking, probably up to the last 2 bosses of BWL. Seems a few people think PUGS will get to the point of full clearing Naxx. I'm not saying its impossible, but I thought I read that original Naxx had the lowest completion % of any raid in WoW history. Has the average player improved so much that even in a PUG they can clear it?
---
Pally tanks have no taunt if I'm right... so they should be doing all the pulls. As a healing priest I can heal through all of the pulls in there and could even when I was in blues/greens not blues/epics. The only exception is maybe the miniboss fight with the room aoe damage if the priest isn't well geared and even then if the priest starts casting and the tank pulls the priest can land shackle second giving the tank initial aggro.
---
Whatever that garbage gear will be replaced in several levels anyway
---
Keep being chill to people and karma rolls will be good to you
---
Sure there is a diffrence between vanilla as a fresh new game and classic that i already played and knew what endgame to expect.
---
But in vanilla we were a bunch of 5+ dudes leveling together. 
---
One of us started a new Toon, at least one or everybody started new too. A New realm? Lets hop on that realm where no higher levels gank us. We changed realm 5 times sure.
---
This is alot of trouble i avoided in classic.
---
IKR /r/2007scape is incredible because it's kind of evolved into self-aware satire and genuinely funny posts that actually spark discussion. I don't even play OSRS anymore and I spend way more time there than this sub
---
...so make it 1000 on vanilla. Are you that dense?
---
Well that's good you don't agree because you are only pre hitting as a tank
---
This sub is also on reddit, which makes you a redditor.
---
Anyone in the shadow priests group gets healed from the damage the shadow priest deals. It doesn't matter if the party members are warlocks or warriors.
---
Yeah that sounds like an over-exaggerated statistics that you just made up.
---
What faction and server?
---
I once played on imbalanced high population pvp server. guess what i did? I took the free transfer. let me taste your tears more mmmmmmmmm
---
Why would you not give the weapons to the top dps class in the game? Rogues take a backseat to Warriors in every aspect of PVE.
---
You didn't mention the difference. If people can't transfer, they will quit. Both will cause the same results. 
---
Poor planning? By this do you mean picking Alliance or not being able to tell the future with regards to server ratios? Don't tell me you predicted the exact ratio and population of every single server.
---
Using your logic, I would say it's poor planning and short sightedness of horde players picking the known overpopulated faction.
---
some people bloat themselve in FR for ragnaros too.
---
imagine being bad
---
As a tank and a healer you can farm gold pretty easily.   
---
Tanks - Strat live runs with first orb on res. Ez money
---
Healers - DM:E Lasher runs . Pretty sure every healer can do this. Maybe not druids? 
---
Tank and healer duos - DM:E Jump runs. If you're not very geared, get a third DPS.   
---
Theres always ways to make money. Its about how much effort you want to put into it.
---
And today after 12 years of warcraft, I realize that I can just type /lol instead of /laugh...
---
I think the only real way to do it, would be to rotate tanks.
---
You can't have one tank, taking all the damage, like normal, due to the 60s Debuff.
---
So 5 Warriors, rotating who's tanking, but it'd be slow, and you'd need to kill packs of mobs fast enough, and rotating the threat around would need an insane amount of coordination.
---
Are you perhaps trying to gank them in a group?
---
Imagine how proud I am that you’ve recognized my hyperbole
---
Like 90% of druids I ran into during phase 1 were hotw/ns.  How many do you think would be that spec if we had dual spec?
---
Yeah I wouldn't call a guild who just needs a few spots a pug.
---
You’re right, I guess I just assumed they’d add transfers. It wasn’t bad before everyone else stopped playing.
---
Spec identity and player identity were quite intertwined in Vanilla. When I think of my old guildmates I think of them as the spec they raided (and usually PvP'd) as. It's a major factor in the role playing element of the game and such things are social adhesive. 
---
None of what he said is bullshit in the slightest.
---
I'm just being optimistic. I want to enjoy PvP again.
---
Spy doesn’t show players in stealth unless they can be seen by the player, fyi.
---
Asa Rogue  not saying it isn’t bullshit but it’s not like it tells you a stealthed player from 50yrds out.
---
i got camped a lot when i was leveling, but that was before I took the free transfer. you reap what you sow. get rekt
---
Sure, but you replied to a comment asking for the source of servers today being bigger than in 2005. Your source only said they were bigger when layering was in effect. You still haven’t given evidence other than anecdotes
---
Asmon has always bothered me. Hes a condescending basement dweller that criticizes anything he deems unworthy and seems to rage like a child.
---
That being said advertise is fucking worse. He's a leach latched onto asmon's success and made a name for himself by being a caricature of a nerd. I dont think anyone worth their weight thought asmon was a literal god, but his entire online personality is based around being a twerp. Super obnoxious.
---
Your hyperbole is pointless because it's very likely that not even a good amount of people browse a PC video game subreddit on mobile.
---
This is why you dont waste your time on warlocks or shammys if its gonna be close lol
---
Then I don't know, I've never seen this before :(
---
Could if be lag maybe, that it just takes a little time to load in the names?
---
Because if streamers log off early because of griefers then twitch loses money.
---
I was thinking fury build. 30% attack speed flurry and enrage seems pretty good
---
Not to late  
---
People are always leveling new characters. Also for me sometimes I just go to zones to help lower characters out. 
---
Don’t feel like questing or getting hunted by a higher level. Run some lowers through some of the first instances. 
---
Also maybe by the time you level up the mass killings will have faded away.
---
He didn’t streamsnipe though.
---
If the game isn't fun anymore for one side, then that side will adapt by moving on from the game. That will end up killing a portion of the game for the other side, and they might leave too. The long term health of WoW Classic is in jeopardy.
---
guys he means adapt yourself to the horde side of the server
---
That ghost is always getting a few shadowbolts to the face on pull.  Don't bother shackling or tanking it... its dead.
---
Probably 7
---
Scholomance. Scholo trash drop Major Mana Potion (2g per), Dark runes (2g per), Runecloth (Fat stacks), and with so many bosses there are a lot of BOP Blues to vendor. Any boss with a weapon that gets greeded is an easy 4+ gold right there.
---
If that's not enough, Argent Dawn Rep all the way to exalted makes your Naxxramus attunement up to hundreds of gold cheaper, as well as free patterns for +frost resist leather/mail.
---
A lot of people point to 60:40 being balanced... That's 50% more Horde than Alliance. It's nowhere near balanced.
---
Also, a very small imbalance gets way worse over time. You can only lost 2 out of every 3 fights for so long before you log off on stay in town. The 60% faction keeps roaming while a growing proportion of the 40% faction stops participating in PvP completely. 60:40 in overall population probably means 60:10 in the world. 2-3 weeks of that and it's 60:5 and thee other 35% simply quits the game permanently.
---
What a lot of people don't take into account with this problem is that Classic isn't like Retail. People don't come and go, or take breaks. Very few new players will join in the future, we're only going downhill from here. Someone who quits right now is probably not coming back in 2 weeks, 2 months or 2 years.
---
There's a few hunters I've seen on my server selling loot from mauradon princess. Mainly the ring.. 
---
25g if it drops.  I'm not sure exactly how it works.. I just see offers in city/lfg chat.   I assume someone sits in your group in the dungeon and it gets master looted to them.  
---
Could be worth looking into?
---
THIS!!!   
---
I know this is a month old, but you can combine your SWP and Renew (with downranked R1's for purging bait) on one key. It's SO helpful. Probably the second best macro for me as a priest after the mouseovers.   
---
*#showtooltip*  
---
*/cast \[harm,exists,nodead,nomod\]Shadow Word: Pain; \[harm,exists,nodead,mod:shift\]Shadow Word: Pain(Rank 1); \[nomod\]Renew; \[mod:shift\]Renew(Rank 1)*  
---
I use this one\^ But you could bake a mousover clause into that as well. Very useful for me so far. I have it bound to E so I don't feel the need to mousover yet.
---
He didn’t streamsnipe, he just fucked him up quite a few times. Not hard when you’re all on the same server.
---
It's Who?
---
Two ticks of a heavy runecloth bandage is a huge waste.
---
Nah, that’s not the issue. We were spread out because the queues were insane some of the people I played with have the time to sit in queue and I didn’t. They had set servers with other friends and we were left on the outside it wasn’t until we were level 30ish that the queue issues were fixed.
---
Then I'd say that spec is fine for that. You'd probably get more DPS out of a fury/prot build than arms/prot, but arms will definitely give you some good utility that you seem to value.
---
PvP to PvE transfers were in Vanilla
---
#Nochanges
---
You can solo/quest fine as a DPS warrior, but if you refuse to tank then you won't be able to find groups.  I tank on my warrior despite being Arms PVP spec, and it works fine.  Most of the prot talents just increase your threat or mitigation, which are things that can be achieved through gear or worked around with CC/agro dumps.  All in all, not a big deal for dungeons.
---
I also don't run with DPS warriors.  I would prefer not to run with paladins either, but I do if they're healing or if i don't need drops.  Fact is that drops sometimes take a long time to get and I don't want to lose the roll to someone who I didn't have to bring in the first place because their position in the party (DPS) is a dime a dozen and they're the worst pick of the lot.
---
I say worst pick because while leveling and still in dungeon blues, DPS warriors are shit compared to literally any other pure DPS class, AND bring 0 utility that I can't provide as a tanking warrior.  They also tend to pull agro, and they actually WANT agro since damage gives them rage and makes it possible to do damage.  This makes MY job harder since I'm getting rage starved, as well as making it harder to heal.
---
Tanking isn't all that hard and is a skillset that you should have as a warrior player.  It's basically DPS'ing but with different skills, intending to cause threat instead of direct damage.  The hardest part is learning how to judge pulls and put up marks, which are things you can learn more easily with friends, but you'll pick up quickly with a bit of experience.  Also, if you run dungeons you almost out-level, it will make it easier to learn since you'll be dealing more damage, making agro easier, and being easier to heal.
---
Try sound/spells/screech.ogg
---
I don't have a hunter myself to try. If it doesn't work let me know if your pet is an owl, carrion bird or bat and I will do some more searching.
---
If you want to listen to the sound and compare to the ingame sound go to [this page](https://wow.tools/files/#search=screech.ogg) and click the eye-looking icon to the right and it will play the sound.
---
Hah I'd love to have edgemasters if I could afford em.  I'll work on the hit, maybe run princess for that second ring for starters.  Thanks for the input!  And I'm here asking for criticism so thank you!
---
Because that means 5k horde players just aren't playing anymore.
---
How do you think that is a solution?
---
So you give the tank gear to fury/prot and the dps gear to 17/34's.
---
Maybe learn what loot you actually need so you arent a huntard in the future. Other ckasses do this, I dont know why hunters are so brainless when it comes to loot.
---
Tellmewhen will show you what you need, you can select to show effects cast by you or any other...

Stream sniping us against the rules though so I am assuming that is what they got him for.

I'm sure plenty of people saying that are the among the Horde in the video (or those doing the same thing on their sever) and love the power trip.

Their behavior speaks for itself. You can sign off on it all you want, but it doesn't change the facts or the experience of the majority of the player base. I like how you add in a baseless ad hominem in your comment though. /s
---
It’s not a temper tantrum lol I was just asking. I don’t have the time anymore to grind to 60, Am having a kid in less than a week.
---
Advertise has a video explaining how he finds Asmongold ingame without streamsniping. Id like to see the actual proof of the streamsniping and not just someone streaming getting killed and crying streamsnipe like they always do.
---
My experience of rag and ony fights as a healer is that fire resist is a very important stat. If you get one shot then you can't heal anyone.
---
So roll on a different server or delete your character
---
That's just 20 swaps at max cost. It's still WAY too cheap for what it does.
---
I don’t have the time to grind another 60, bout to have a kid.
---

Why the fuck do we have so many star wars memes on this sub? 
---
This is a WoW subreddit.
---
Yeah, but first you need the aclg :). T1 warrior gloves are good since both fire res and +hit, nothing compared to aclg tho
---
I'm thinking about rolling on a PvE server because of the phase 2 shenanigans, and I want to try something I've never played before. Hunter, rogue, or shaman. I've mostly played caster dps and some holy priest throughout wow, but played Warlock in vanilla/TBC.
---
Hunter: good ranged DPS, solid levelling, I like having a pet, will be playing solo a lot so farming at 60 will be easier. Cons are hunter stigma for groups, ammo dependency reducing bag space, keeping the pet fed,gear competition.
---
Rogue: haven't played a melee class before, seems like fun, I like the class fantasy. Cons are gear competition, seems to be dependent on mats for a lot of abilities, always seem to be lots of rogues.
---
Shaman: Hybrid class so I can do different roles, can swing a big 2h which seems fun, totems are unique. Cons are pressure to heal at 60, not sure I can feel great rolling on cloth healing gear.
---
Anyone have any insight?
---
So you are punishing players for doing literally nothing wrong?
---
Transferring will never happen, people will just quit.
---
Only thing that fixes anything is a faction queue combined with transfers for those stuck in said queue but Activision doesn't care and will *not* fix this.
---
All their live realms were 90% of one faction 10% of the other until they removed them and added war mode.
---
Classic is just another part of the WoW cash cow. Minimal effort for good profits.
---
hi calvin
---
What server is this where you can have a 1v1 in BRM?
---
I mean the rebel camp. Not a city I guess but a safe haven
---
There are three arguments for it not be in classic.
---
The first, which is kind of the only valid one but still dumb is it wasn't in vanilla so it isn't in classic.  It's dumb, but it's the reality and that's going to be the end.  The others are dumb shit people parrot to sound like vanilla was some bastion of shit it never was.

Second argument is economic management.  You need gold sinks!  Respeccing overly taxed specs with the least ability to farm, usually healers/tanks.  Those who could more easily farm in pvp/pve specs wouldn't need to respec as often.  Thus it ended up giving certain classes a distinct edge in making gold.  This also ignores the cost dualspec had when it was released, although by then there had been significant gold inflation.  This is also a stupid argument because it's entirely predicated on the fact that it wasn't in the game in vanilla.  Shit like repair costs were normalized and I don't see people asking to go back to higher armor classes needing to cost significantly more than lower ones.  This argument is only something people use because they feel dumb saying "it wasn't in vanilla so not in classic" so they want to invent some bullshit to make it sound like an actual important mechanic.
---
The third is "character identity".  This one is also bullshit because specs changed as something else became better.  Mages were overwhelmingly frost during MC/BWL not because mages liked it but because it was the best for those instances.  When so much shit is immune/resistant to fire, raiding as fire doesn't make sense.  As soon as AQ hit mages swapped over and saw a massive spike in damage.  Declaring the cost to respec build an identity is stupid because the character identity is larger built around what is "best" at the time.  Respec exists because the amount of time necessary to level and gear the character is very high and making mistakes can ruin a character.  Character identity isn't tied to the spec, once again that is some stupid bullshit people who never played vanilla made up because they don't want the argument to end with "it wasn't in vanilla so it's not in classic".
---
The reality is that dual spec, or at least a significantly reduced respec cost was one of the single most requested things in vanilla.  All of this moon logic to justify not having it in classic makes no sense because the single reason is, it wasn't in vanilla.  The vast majority of people in vanilla wanted it.  Blizzard probably couldn't get it work without deleting our bags or some shit so it was never added.
---
Omae wa mou... Shindeiru.
---
“Like they’re 10 years old” would probably be more acceptable.
---
I was always short on gold but I know why, my stupid kidself never looted greys of whites because I decided they were junk.  I also bought every single spell each time I levelled up.
---
Fucking prequelmemes have been leaking into /r/classicwow a lot lately.
---
This is the same thing is paparazzi. Yeah it's probably annoying for the celebs getting followed around, but that's what you signed up for. It isn't illegal. You're literally broadcasting yourself on a public spectrum, to hundreds of thousands of people, and you're confused people are fucking with you? I have zero sympathy for asmon. Cry baby about anything and everything he can. Crazy thought, if he likes the game so much and streaming comes second, as he's said so many fucking times... Then crazy thought here... why not turn off the stream and just play? WHOA HOLY SHIT GROUND BREAKING IDEA RIGHT?! Asmon is literally the meme of the dude on the bike putting the stick in the spokes and fucking himself.
---
Ok but it’s not JUST the gear.
---
Everyone is so much better at the game than they were in vanilla.
---
People were doing MC in classic with groups filled with sub-level 60s who couldn’t even equip most of this BiS gear.
---
Most of my guild from retail all went to a server with a 5+ hour queue for a while. We were anticipating being able to do a paid transfer.
---
If you have to queue at the BM, you can queue solo. Technically you can then fly out to wherever you want to PvP but you can’t join any groups.
---
If you queue as a raid I think you can invite ppl, and only those who received the initial queue can join the bg. It’s possible that inviting someone will to the raid will restart your queue.
---
You then have to fly or hearth back to a major city and requeue when you get out.
---
Most players I imagine will queue and afk.
---
Also, we don’t know how cross server BGs are going to work. If Blizz uses one large Battlegroup then A/H is pretty even, though I imagine more Horde will queue for BGs. So queue times for BGs may not actually be that long.
---
They're PLAYING THE GAME themselves and not botting I'm assuming, so how is it NOT their fault?
---
Most elite guilds don't bring 1. 
---
semi-elite guilds might bring 1
---
casual guilds probably don't care.
---
So all the druids?
---
How is he a liar?
---
Yes, it is better to inconvenience the smaller group.
---
How is that even a question?
---
As for solutions - blizzard has had 15 years to fix this in retail and their fix was just turning off wpvp on every server.
---
Lmao Asmongold, when is this guy going away?
---
Every single time until it's fixed.
---
Fury prot still needs a bunch of the DPS gear. Onslaught Girdle is still BIS, Band of Accuria (both for either really), Quick Strike Ring, Truflights are good for fury prot.
---
Fury prot doesn't really work as great without DPS gear weaved in there.
---
Maeve: my job here is done.
---
You: but you didn’t do anything...
---
The play is to get Stronghold Gaunlets and you never have to switch gloves pvping ever again
---
Alliance account.

Find them.
---
Streamsniping is watching their stream live.
---
Shadow priests can do whatever they want, just don’t be surprised if nobody wants to take them. Also as a mage or lock losing upgrades to a shadow priest feels really shitty. Kinda like losing BRE to a ret pally.
---
Great, thanks a lot! How would that look with a mouseover?
---
Classic "who is on first base".
---
But that has absolutely nothing to do with the ability to respec.  That has entirely to do with what they thought was best for what they were doing.  Saying dual spec isn't in because of "spec identity" makes no sense.  Dual spec wouldn't have changed the spec those people played most of the time.  The spec identity was related to what the person did, not if they could change.
---
CHT for me
---
Perd for... Me.
---
I'm starting to think the default roll needs to be 1 to 1000.
---
I hate being that guy, but if you believed classic would be the same as retail.... then maybe you should just go back to retail... we most likely won’t get paid character moves for a long time if at all
---
Nice. Im going to play that as well. What kind of gear do you use?
---
They're so mad.
---
I started playing on the most populated russian server whereas my 2 friends rolled on a dead server (or whatever is called “low pop”). Now one of them quit and another one regrets not having started with me but doesn’t want to play there alone either. I don’t know what you expected - people were staying in queue for a reason, you decided to skip the queue and now you blame blizzard for your own mistake.
---
Streamsniping is watching their stream live, zero evidence he did that.
---
What other games do this?
---
Also make sure those games have a 200 hour reroll tax. And not just rerouting from purple to blue.
---
It is, I will articulate my tought one last time.
---
I don't see many solution to fix the population balance problem that we have right now.
---
Either allow xrealm transfer with restriction to ensure the problem isn't getting worse every day and maybe add a faction queue to force people to move server.
---
Or maybe they should try to do something in order to keep alliance from leaving the game and making the balance even worse. Because they are people leaving on the alliance side. 
---
What is clear is that all the people against that are dismissing that their Is a problem and don't even try to argue in why their isn't.
---
Classic Embriel not using brain just posting some shit Ion said as facts.
---
Yeah i had an origional meme get removed but im so glad we saw 2 BFFs dings 60 together...
---
If this happened, Skeram would die, and I would help kill it
---
"Yes! Not the pronoun, but the player with the unlikely name of "you"
---
Stream sniping IMO shouldn't even be against the TOS. It's a nature of the platform. However, even keeping in mind that it is against the TOS, Advertise is in a bizarre gray area.  
---
Why Advertise was in a gray area is because he was not watching Asmon's stream. I believe him 100% that he did not have Asmon's stream up. He however began to get unsolicited tells from people informing him of where Asmon was.  
---
Is that still stream sniping? Once you have the knowledge, you can't get rid of it, so even if Advertise wanted to ignore these tells the second he reads them even unintentionally, he now has the same knowledge he could have gotten from watching the stream. Should Advertise force himself to stop hunting down Asmon because people are giving him hints?  
---
This is why I hate Twitch as an entertainment platform for games like WoW. There are a lot of lose/lose situations like this one.
---
Run, you fools
---
Then why try to white knight?
---
Who is tanking, You is healing and They is dps. Now summon Them, our other dps.
---
For PvP a slow 2h for those huge MS crits.
---
FINE. Guess I'll wand.
---
Mooo ♥️
---
You generally can only have one corruption for the entire raid.  Weird stuff happens when you approach even *15* debuffs, procs like improved shadowbolt can knock off your winters chill stacks (quite bad).  Corruption can knock SWP off if you have an spriest in your raid.  
---
Once your tanks get ok gear they should be able to outpace all DPS on aggro as long as they're given a few seconds to get a sunder and taunt down.  If you really outgear your tanks by a lot it can potentially be an issue, and this is a big reason raids will gear their tanks first since they can cap all their DPS who is in pre-bis. 
---
Ony can still be a threat problem.  Phase 3 you probably need to pause for a second every time you crit even if you ate a fireball in P2.
---
Abolish poison too (druid)
---
I'd love to see your logs, so that I can help improve my guild by seeing how your guild optimizes.
---
I am absolutely okay with that.
---
I'm fine with no wpvp if it means I get to fucking log on.
---
&gt; I cannot fault the warlock
---
Really?  I play a warlock, its not difficult to understand summoning yourself is dumb in that situation.
---
Some highlight reel from the literal stone age of vanilla showing pre-nerf windfury while wearing literal best in slot gear? It's literally nothing but a crit reel against clothies.
---
About as inspirational as it is misleading 🙄
---
Focus on +healing until you have about 250+. Then I would say focus on spirit if you're having mana issues due to long fights, which you shouldn't be having with MC/Ony.
---
You should be gearing for threat rather than mitigation. As a Tauren you want to invest in Edgemasters as soon as you can afford them. Try to get Edgemasters + 6% hit from other gear. Or just 9% hit, but this is worse than edgemasters and +6% because having a higher weapon skill from Edgemasters also has the added benefit of reducing the damage penalty of your glancing blows. more damage = more threat
---
You do not NEED the above to successfully MT/OT the current raids. I MT'd MC/Ony for 3 weeks at 7% hit and never had any threat issues, but as the dps gear up you need to get to the cap to prevent losing aggro as they will be putting out higher numbers.
---
as an alliance on herod, this is a flat out lie.
---
This video is a super slanted view. Go anywhere solo on skeram as either faction and you will be killed over and over. I was herbing in EPL and a &lt;Rise&gt; group of ally were rolling around 5-8 people killing everything. 
---
Dude should have grouped up with his party and pushed in from Morgans Vigil as a 5 man. They easily would have made t a decent way in died then could have rezed as a group and made it in way easier.
---
Anytime I do group content I wait and group up with my party then leave the town and we run into 5v5 battles and they are actually fun.
---
Is the server horde sided yes. If this guy giving himself the worst odds to get to his dungeon Big Yes.
---
They viewed what he did as targeted harassment or something. Its against their TOS for someone to specifically do things to harass or derail someone else on the platform. It has less to do with WoW and more to do with that. Also I think the ban is only for seven days.
---
u just bad.
---
Bro Judgment Crown is miles below Lionheart for stat budget. It's okay to not want to spend the money on it (though what else is there to spend money on really) but then you can't argue about BiS anymore, you're just using whatever you can afford that's okay and that's fine. There's no disputing BiS, math is math.
---
You don't understand the issue which makes sense since you play on a care bear server.
---
Since the honor system was released everyone is now ganking because they want PvP rewards.  This makes every zone unplayable.  Once the BGs open the thousands of gankers will be in BGs. Everything goes back to normal
---
Oh of course, but there's very few drops in P1/2 for DPS warriors. 
---
DB / Vis / Onslaught / Quickstrike / Strikers (Also tank) / Accuria / Whatever the Agi cloak off rag is / CHT / Pred / ACLG / Truflight / Flameguard. 
---
Most of those items can be argued as great for fury prot as well. DB / Vis I would never take over DPS, but depending on current set up all of the other stuff is up in the air. Meh also flameguard I wouldn't use as a fury / prot. So 3 or 4 ish items that drop in P1/2 are DPS warrior items and the rest are DPS Warrior and Fury Prot warrior. Which is basically what I was saying. 
---
Phase 3 is going to be rough for DPS warriors and fury prot warriors. DFT, Nef head, Chromatic boots (fury prot probably doesnt NEED these by then), The Sta / Agi / Str / Dodge shoulders + their entire mitigation set.
---
Death grips for rogues?
---
Some people dont care about min/maxing their AH sales and just want quick cash.  I don't really understand why people get so upset over it.
---
devils advocate?
---
/r/ffxiv and /r/shitpostxiv  
---
shitpost is for exactly that, but also making fun of the sub for the pretty pictures and "I'm back after 10 years and now playing again" random screen shot.
---
It's not the nicest place, but it at least culls the trolls and goons from bemoaning the regular sub, as people do still like those pretty pictures and progress pics.  
---
Different tastes for what people want on the internet I guess
---
I have strafe set to my mouse thumb buttons, with that you don't need keyboard to move. Just strafe "backwards" instead of backing up, it's actually faster and you won't get Dazed in combat.

 I have someone on my friends list who only has 1 arm and she plays just fine she does Heroic raiding and Mythic+ dungeons

Who cares?

Priced to sell fast.

If you want to make more then buy up the low bidders and reset the price to your liking.
---
He LITERALLY made a video explaining what he does, are you actually out of your mind holy shit, keep sucking off streamer fucktard asmonmald
---
Nah all you see in raids are duel wielding fury warriors.
---
If it's a price point where they can make profit but you can't, who's the sucker?
---
Tuere was a naxx pug that would on private servers.
---
No, it's not a 101 - you're asking for an "ELI5". As for the answer - they undercut massively to get some gold.
---
it is, good thing is that i got off from work just when the queu starts so no prob after all.
---
I don't care about playing the AH. If I want to get rid of something I will undercut by a lot.
---
Just checked and you can keybind moving to whatever you want.

I would go with the razr naga 18 button mouse personally but see what's out there.

Duality realky is fun and frustrating at the same time. Duality is everywhere. That iswhy it is kinda hard to understand the universe, because duality can be a tricky thing :) duality is probably not meant to be understand by everyday man conncissnes. Good night :)
---
Change servers.
---
Nope. For rogues what you want to do is put a steel weapon chain on your **OFFHAND**.
---
SWC makes *YOU* immune to disarm, not the weapon. So you put SWC on your offhand to get the immunity, then put crusader (or whatever the rogue equivalent is) on your MH.
---
Lol not even past 30? Gg noob
---
Im not saying its my damage, but im saying its my damage. Ok. That debuff is the only reason shadow priests are not complete crap and only sort of crap. You could switch out your spriest with a lock and the total raid dmg would not drop. So stop saying its your damage.
---
Because they want it to sell fast and don't mind the slight profit cut
---
There's a pair of mail gloves that I got from a bed quest that gave 2%hit which is really nice. Also lionheart helm(super expensive) or a hit/crit piece from strat
---
I can see an argument for gold sinks, but character identity is dumb. When I played in Wrath I had two specs. I had my feral raiding spec and my feral PvP spec. I was known as a feral druid, the only difference was I was able to raid in the best raiding spec and PvP in the best PvP spec. All this does is makes it inconvenient for those who can't be bothered to farm gold to switch weekly.
---
unless tanking, right?
---
I'd rather roll the hunter dwarf for flavor but shadowmeld just feels too good on a hunter to pass up.  And on a PVP server, war is upon you whether you choose it or not.
---
I honestly haven't had many of those as I'm not too great at predicting them. Reflecting fears and mind blasts has been fun af tho.
---
Lucky Classic is based of 1.12 then.
---
Free transfer without having imbalance preventatives are actively killing my once balanced server. Who opens this shit up to spread to other servers before addressing the main problem?
---
Perfectly okay to off tank in but without a lot of threat pieces holding aggro will be hard. I would recommend especially getting some hit for consistency. Preferably edgemaster's handguards but there are a lot of hit pieces to get. Brigam's girdle, Voone's grips, another tarnished ring/blackstone ring, Rune of the Guard captain, Satyr's bow etc.
---
With 2% hit the amount of missed shield slams can and will lead to a lot of DPS pulling aggro and dying, especially better geared ones. After you reach 9% hit or 6% with edgemaster handguards aggro shouldn't be as big of a problem!
---
Please read what I said about why it's "better" than taking CHT over melee that need it. I'm not saying using lok is a good idea, but it comes free along with your free bow. Obviously you should be using one of like 4 better, easier blue options.
---
What did you sell it for
---
I feel that had more to do with the fact that it was only out for a few months until BC came out
---
They had time to sit in queue , I did not and had a large amount of people who also had time to wait from our retail guild on that server. I get where you’re coming from but after 12ish days played to get to 60 I don’t wanna do that again.
---
Did you eventually track down this POS?
---
&gt; your probably going to be grouped with other shadows or locks to get the impact from the debuff
---
I was responding to this.
---
Exhibit B
---
We have numerous rotating stickies that garner hundreds of comments every day...
---
He isnt complaining about gankers or PvP.
---
He is complaining about the current PvP honor system forcing thousands of people to gank to grind honor.  Blizzard dropped the ball by not adding honor with BGs.
---
It is a dumb solution because PvP servers have better players, PvP is fun, and the problem will be solved shortly (bgs open)
---
So why should he abandon his character for an inferior server when the problem will be solved long before he catches up on your carebear realm?
---
I'd bet it overrides WF. On a somewhat related note, if you pop elixir mongoose first you can pop agil after and they both stay.
---
I'm on two different servers as 60. Both mine are like this too. You cant have over 50 raiding guilds on classic vs under 15 on vanilla and expect world buffs to be the same. It really is shit.
---
how many times you gonna spam this defense?

Is she able to use an xbox controller? She could try to use [ConsolePort](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port/files).

Remember she has to visit consoleport.net in order to get the download link for WoWMapper which is necessary to make everything work.

Maybe she can use a "Razer Tartarus V.2" in her lap or somethin?

Can you explain how HS queue works?
---
Leif in concert
---
Yeah, I was speaking strictly dps, tanking is sword and board. Although there is an element of duel wield tanking out there, it's a bit more advanced.
---
What are you talking about? Mixer is a ghost town. There is currently 55 collective viewers across all the wow steams on there.
---
Haha, ya, I am bad at wow. You got me! Don’t really care. My guild and I are just a bunch of jackasses having a ton of fun together.
---
Also, who are you quoting?
---
I must confess that I caused a Rend fuck up my first UBRS run in classic.  Nobody said anything about dismissing pets.  If it was any pet other than the imp, I would have dismissed it; I thought the invisibility would let it run around and pop in without pulling the hallway.  Oopsie.
---
Ret palys are a support class that can beat any class 1v1. But it's a gamble. I can 1 shot clothiers of I roll the dice good enough. 
---
With AV coming about you get the unstoppable force and your PvP gear and your set as a ret paly. Crit+soc crit+hoj crit and judgment crit melts people. 
---
 The only class I struggle against is shadow priests. But I swear their shield is bugged. Its suppose to go away when critd but it doesnt. All in all we are a support class.
---
You have a few options: 
---
* Bloodmail boots from Scholo (1% hit)
---
* Battleborn Armbraces from UBRS   (1% hit + 1% crit)
---
* Rune of the Guard Captain trinket from Hinterlands quests (1% hit)
---
A decent stand-in for Edgemasters is also Voone's Vice Grips (this is what I used till I could afford Edgemasters). These only give you 2% hit so they are obviously worse, but they are not bad if you can't get capped.
---
Like I said though I wouldn't worry about the cap too much as you should be able to tank just fine without it early on unless you are joining a raid with some already decked out DPS. Without having the cap you will just not be doing as much threat to the few level 63 trash mobs and the bosses.
---
As holy reckoning I can easily 1v1 warriors and rogues.
---
With a bubble I can beat warlocks too
---
Other than that I'm fucked, don't have engineering so I cant deal with mages. Priests just mana burn me. Hunters outside of duels kite me. Shaman burst is random, but they usually kill me with a few crits
---
&gt;Dude should have grouped up with his party and pushed in from Morgans Vigil as a 5 man.
---
Do you honestly think that 5 people would stand a chance against the 100-200 horde that are inside BRM 24/7?  
---
I'm sure that certain area of the world will be fought by groups of Alliance players, but the really high traffic areas (like BRM and DM) are camped by full raids worth of Horde that are just farming honor.   You could say "just avoid those areas" but that doesn't help when those areas contain the only multiple boss raid in the game atm as well several dungeons which drop Pre-raid BIS for many different classes.
---
Stock up on sappers now boys.
---
Doesn't really matter if you're timing it correctly, you can just que hs right before offhand swing, which is easier with a slower offhand. As fury prot I think fast/slow is best for rage dump while having more rage gen from bigger offhand hits. Not sure about fury dps, slow/slow seems best for horde but idk about alli
---
Deactivate Player ranks in your Interface menu
---
I mean more in 5 mans. There's usually 3 classes going for things like truestrike, dal rends, etc. Raids would be different.
---
Shaman and druid can’t farm lashers. They are nature immune.
---
Tank/healer jump runs are only lucrative if you split the spoils evenly. If you aren’t getting in on the mining, it’s not worth it. With a 3rd dps, it’s even less worth.
---
Sure, but not because your damn totems pull half the room lol
---
This 100%.
---
People keep bringing up a changing population and meta while ignoring the impact having multiple times the population has. It is like there  is a camp of people who want so badly to say "this is a different era. What you speak of is impossible" that they ignore gigantic changes like that.
---
The post itself warns of 3 man gank squads. Nobody at all in any post I've seen since phase 2 started has complained about 3 man gank squads. I was running around solo or in a 2-3 man group. I rarely ever found any 3 man groups to fight. Most of our time was spent avoiding 10+ man raids of alliance, the less populated faction on on Incendius.
---
Trying to take this bastardized private server population version and saying the playerbase is too min/max is a huge logical leap, but everyone just seems determined to do it.
---
Asmon should go suck a tail-pipe tbh he is nothing but a waste of oxygen.
---
&gt;implying he's alliance.
---
&gt; None of this is the Horde's fault. 
---
Well they intentionally chose horde so, yeah it kinda is. They  knew they were going to have an advantage on the Alliance, they probably also knew they were gonna have a numerical advantage.
---
Oh ya, I guess I didn't think about salv in classic b/c I only played horde in vanilla.
---
That would be awesome! thank you!
---
Imagine comparing paparazzi to streamsniping. You can't turn one of those off.
---
Meh, depends on the gear.
---
Non-BiS prices are probably at an all time speculative high.
---
BiS prices are actually pretty low right now, because there is little demand; people would rather farm gold or the farm the pieces themselves. 
---
Once BG's hit and people actually can twink, all the BiS items will flood the market to meet demand, and prices will likely be very volatile.
---
I have a Shadowfang as well, I'm likely either listing super high and waiting, or just waiting for a few weeks for the supply to go down. The drop rate on these things is so low that once the backstock clears they'll be hard to find.
---
I though dm runs were needed massively
---
What's bad about dual spec is i respec pvp to pve weakly. I easily earn the gold to do that all the time. If im pvping and someone doesnt take the game as serious as i do runs into me id have an advantage because i take the game more serious then they do and they most likely arent switching specs so i can kill someone in pve spec because i was ready and they were not.
---
He might be trying to get the price lowered so he can buy a massive amount for himself
---
I play on Westfall, Horde side, and we're significantly outnumbered by alliance. They have at least 2x the number of players as we do. It's already a bit of an issue for Horde, and our guild sometimes has to just have people drop the head in the middle of the night just to get their items. Must be really bad on the Alliance side I'd imagine, probably as bad as OP describes.
---
Payo vs. Snutz is CDL showed how. But a few things aren’t allowed for locks so could have been different.
---
Another one of these dumb posts claiming to be for nochanges but then say something that's a huge change.
---
Its bad for classic. Specs matter because you only have one. It makes it a gold sink and you have to plan for respecs so you dont waste gold pr week for pvp and pve. If you dont like it, classic is not for you.
---
&gt; And thank you for keeping your cool with most of us when people can be toxic.
---
If people are on this subreddit, they're probably really passionate about Classic. I'm not gonna get mad at people for being mad at us mods for doing things in a way that they don't like, because I genuinely believe people complaining are doing so because they love Classic and want this subreddit to be a great place for them to hang out and talk about Classic.
---
Hard to hate people that are passionate.
---
I follow both, so this does not bother me.
---
To answer the question it's funny to see people tilt. Its great to visibly see the distress the person has because they don't have critical thinking. Outside of that not sure what to say man when it happens to me I do something about it, because I know its how the game is played and always has been. Your question is very vague because many people gank for many reasons, like trolling, for fun, because of boredom, to past time, there are just way too many answers to list. Hell, it could be something as simple as I hate your class so your gonna get it. PS I do always play on high population servers ones that have a good balance of players on both sides.
---
How much
---
I'll be sure to do so! I think keybinding auto run on the mouse might work best.. thank you for the tip!
---
Horde Kirtonos here. It's more balanced than some servers, but I must say it's quite nice basically having tons of people "guarding" you and controlling BRM. It must suck to be alliance. If you want to farm a dungeon you basically have to travel in a pack, coordinating flights and movement.
---
I generally don't gank people unless they gank me. It's become a waste of time in most instances. No reason to rush the honor grind now when AV/WSG are just 2 weeks away. It's hard enough to farm honor now as is. Seems alliance have just stopped wasting time trying.
---
You’re a shaman. Not impressed. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
If you go Flurry you won't be able to get Tactical Mastery from the Arms tree, so you wont be able to stance dance effectively, you will also be missing a lot and not have Bloodthirst. You'll be running around AAing, getting kited for days and be free honor for your opponents

No, they're different.  One of them was suggesting Blizzard just pick a bunch of horde players and swap them to a different realm.  Faction q with free transfer allows the player to choose whether to sit in a q or change servers.
---
Oh yeah the bozo said debuff at the end... Heh carry on
---
You couldn't replace an spriest with a lock, you literally then reduce the other however many locks damage by 15%. It's not my damage persay, but without the debuff that damage is not there. The more locks you have with the spriest the more damage is done with the weave. It would drop considering my damage is consistent if not higher then 75% of the locks. Hard to understand huh. Sub 3 minute fights, spriest are top notch. Give us longer fights and we drop in value but it'll be awhile.
---
&gt; They easily would have made t a decent way in died then could have rezed as a group and made it in way easier.
---
I legit say they would have died but they would have an easier time going in as 5, and would probably have to death run 1-2 times less this way. I also go on to say there are way more horde as a balance issue but this dude just is making a video with the worst possible chances of getting to BRD. Hard to help those who wont help them self. He should be coming in from the south and jumping down. Then he and his group could rez in the hallway to BRD. Dude just wanted to die over and over.
---
Best comment ever.
---
**SKIP THE CHAIN!** When you are running to BRS, do not try to climb up the chain if you are going to get ganked. Just rez under the chain, and die in the corner just below where your corpse is. You do this so you can ghost run up the chain, jump to the BRS entrance, and ressurect just before hitting the instance threshold. Every time I have done this, horde were camping the chain and took a few seconds to get to me. Those few seconds positioned my future corpse to the ideal position to avoid 2-3 corpse drags.
---
Get her a Razer Tartarus, or an Orbweaver.
---
I use one when I play WoW, and I hardly ever have to touch my actual keyboard for anything aside from typing in chat while playing.
---
My experience is is that this is complete horseshit. 85% of players are not as good as the best players back then. Not even remotely close. I've been playing solo and in small groups, and most players are just as gd bad as they used to be, at least in pvp.
---
I've had 1 vs 1s against several hunters. Almost every single one tries to aimed shot me while I'm shooting them. 
---
90% of mages are just bad after aoe farming to 60. I had issues with most frost mages on private servers. On Incendius I not only win vs every mage, but I win easily. They aren't even a class I fear, because most mages are bad bsb players.
---
People aren't having a worse experience due to everyone being better. They are having a worse experience due to their being a greatly enhanced population.
---
You're not really modeling this correctly and must be comparing lucky parses to normal ones. White hits should be at least 50% if not more of your damage especially with hstrike queueing to hit more. While it doesn't affect BT the weapons are effectively 14 ap per point of damage higher than another weapon. So Viskag versus Thrash is 20 dps difference for 280 effectiveAP on each melee hit and ww. That's a significant amount of damage and rage generation. Rage generation in the execute phase is also a large chunk of raid dps, getting off one or two more executes is 4-8k damage in a 1-2 minute fight. 
---
I am human with mass and mirah's and full bis with lionheart and another guy in our guild is a gnome with viskag and brut blade and bis as well. I got blown out of the water by 20% on ony last night and I parse in the 80's and 90's for my fights. He just does a lot more damage even without edgemasters. I'm doing stones, elixirs, rage of ages, argent dawn food, et cetera. Maybe world buffs would put our damage closer but I bet it might just drive the disparity.
---
I admit it, i was one of them (well thinking it, not saying it anywhere) XD
---
But shouldn't be punished to hell for it.
---
P.S. Playing horde, want to transfer to PvE server where I can get 1 vs 1 (point fights).
---
If it was really that big of an undercut of the actual price for the items you'd have already bought it and resold it.
---
So...
---
I've ran three MC pugs and we've never gotten rag down wipe during the sons. But it's a good way to gear up if you can't get a raid spot
---
Ony is crazy easy with pug, never wiped
---
Adapt and Overcome.  Set up a channel in your discord for players to report the timing of the most recent ony buff so that you know the timing of the following one and can plan around it accordingly.
---
herbalism.
---
The servers are working, I can log in just fine.
---
Honestly if Blizzard didnt want to manage factions at all they should have just followed retail and released one server type with "War Mode" for those who want pvp
---
They've made 10 000 other changes so that would hardly matter.
---
You still go defstance for the 15% more threat. Than spam Sunder Armor cause its off-weaponswing. Revange after a block, Heroic Strike if too much rage.
---
After pull/charge do a demo should for a bit aoe aggro, so the healer dont gets it instant.
---
If you have rogues that take aggro by nuking their 100 energy and 5 combopoints before you even generated 5 rage - just build aggro on the other targets first and taunt over their aggro after.
---
No wonder you have 69g only
---
It’s a hypothetical discussion and you think that arbitrary rules are out of the question? lol
---
Sounds like a fun time.
---
It's not harder by any stretch of the means. It's pretty damn easy for what's available in game now. BWL is the first really thing the game offers that requires thought process.
---
You think the giant trail of people behind him makes it difficult to find exactly where he is in a zone?
---
A group of druids, named Him, You, Them, They, and Noone.
---
Where did he say nobody should attack him? He simply said someone who ambushes him is going to get 2 deaths in return.
---
You mean in a straight up duel or also when the rogue ambushes the lock? Haven't played lock at all, so I have no idea what they're capable of.
---
Well we all can guess the difference and its not in the favor of PvP servers... so PvP to PvE is fine.
---
This will happen for all of a week, and then it will be over. That's a unique experience to revel in. What's not to like?
---
Why does everyone think we were dumb in vanilla? If you played competitively in pve you knew how ony head worked and tried to time it. The difference is we didnt have so many people so we'd drop 3 heads in a row starting in the middle of the night to ensure our progression raid had the buff. Then we were done for the week.
---
In classic, one mega guild can control it indefinitely just for being one of the first guilds to hit 60. It's fked. The megaservers are fked. Just remove then CD.
---
Not if they’re arent scrubs.
---
Only scrubs rushed right back to a gankbush
---
Do you need a Twitch account to watch Asmon’s stream?
---
If not, Advertise can still watch the stream and still gank in WoW.
---
Okay well who's on first?
---
&gt;AQ
---
Should be dealt with in a matter of hours. AQ was nos very hard, we were farming it and we barely killed ragnaros faster than they currently do. Same with naxx.
---
Pug may struggle in naxx, but as is really easy
---
Go for the dreadmist/magisters set for AoE grinding. Stam and int is critical.
---
Unpopular Opinion time:
---
I think he should be banned and targetted ganking of a streamer should also should be bannable in game.
---
Theres literal discords of people trying to make peoples lives hell in game, who cares if he streams his location? If your goal is to literally prevent this man from playing the game / and making money (streaming is their JOB) then you should be punished. Don't try to pretend this is him getting ganked once or twice then he got perma'd. 
---
That isn't PVP. Its greifing. I understand this subreddit HATES streamers, hell I even dislike Asmongold too, but stop defending literal trolls because you hate the guy.
---
Before you say don't roll a PvP server, what if it was a group  of people just tagging his mobs, ALL DAY, is that not bannable to you?
---
Not quite scones. More like fluffy buttermilk crumpets. Sort of.
---
Like this: https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/unbeatable-sausage-gravy-and-biscuits/3140d428-fb73-4e94-9c9b-ad2f3c7497ec

Nah, meant the actual font. Or is that part of the add on?
---
&gt; "so I always pull for paladin tanks because i can shackle"
---
This priest is an idiot. You don't play priest to hard CC and direct pull order, you play priest so you can get easy dungeon groups in which you perform as little work as humanly possible. If he wanted to make more work for himself, he should've just fearbombed a pack like the rest of us do.
---
Not to mention, the first group could clear UBRS like an hour before the raid, and keep the way clear for people to run through for that first day release. By the second week, everybody will be attuned.
---
"Freeing up players’ time so they can do something they enjoy more than farming multiple hours per week."
---
That is World of Warcraft. It's all one big grind. The more and more you remove of that grind the less incentive you have to play. 
---
That warrior is still going to have to farm just to be able to play PVP and PVE. Potions? Grenades? It all adds up. It's what keeps people playing outside of designated raid times.
---
Maybe a foot pedal or external number pad that and be adjusted for her needs. Really you can do basic questing mouse only but there will be soreness I’d assume.
---
They just have to stand at a certain spot in the waterfalls and the ring can be master looted to them. I think the market for this has dropped though since melee class can just buy the Tarnished Elven Ring from Tributes.
---
Think it is. I don’t use it.
---
Exp to gold conversion on quests was a very late vanilla change.
---
Only way I've seen this work. was everyone was at the top of the aggro list, and overgeared/overleveled the dungeon.
---
Mobs bounced around hitting everyone, one target at a time got focused, whoever was the lowest health worked to move down the threat meter.
---
Occasionally someone could get clear and bandage themselves but recovery usually involved food after the pull.
---
It was very messy and chaotic, and slow compared to how it would have been with traditional tank + healer for same gear and levels but we got through it.
---
Depends on the server, some of the low pop servers have very few people running leveling dungeons
---
That would be a waste. If you're going to twink a Warrior at 39, you need Pendulum of Doom.
---
I'm merely a figment of my imagination.
---
If your a person who really enjoys being a melee as a shaman you can try playing a spell damage and crit ele/enhance build. Taking 100% increase spell crit damage. 2h with FB for caster types, 1h and shield and FT for melee damage classes. Keep melee at range as long as possible, taking engineering and carrying free actions potions will help you bridge the gap. This spec can put out high damage still your biggest downfall from not being ele/resto is nature's swiftness. However getting focus casting in ele and mail armor makes you quite formidable in most pvp and dueling.
---
I get Atiesh, but why is he wearing panty hose?
---
Bonus points for being in a raid and getting saved to a cleared MC id as a result.
---
fucking lame
---
ITT: why can't we hunt down streamers by sniping with impunity? :(
---
50g
---
I wouldn’t consider that a problem. XD I spent 1.5k to 2k in bags. Gold is the least of my worries.
---
Lmfao
---
"no changes" would have required much smaller server populations
---
Wbuffs are cancerous to get. Lotus prices are through the roof. Honor ganking is making it impossible for people to level in their 50s
---
Maybe some changes would help for the big change they already implemented (population)
---
I actually use a steam controller in my left hand and mouse in right. Ive used xbox controller too. Its definitely doable if you are creative.
---
People are using private server experiences or looking at pve which was never challenging to begin with.
---
The average player on Incendius is no better at pvp as the average player was when I was on stormreaver. The average player when I was on private servers most definitely was, though.
---
Probably not covered in that econ 101 he slept through so he can brag about knowing economics.
---
Lol.  That's like saying why do you keep citing the law for the reason I got a speeding ticket!?  
---
If something is the reason something happened, it's not really a defense.. it's the reason.. He violated the TOS of twitch and got banned.  He was warned by Asmon himself not to do it and he continued to do it.
---
That twat just bitched and abused what he has yet again. 
---
Fuck him and any of you that support him.
---
No but it's still not very hard to find someone with that info alone. Also people I'm sure go out of there way to tell the guy exactly where Asmon is currently. 
---
Whether or not its even streamsniping I'm sure twitch doesn't want there streamers going this hard on each other.
---
I couldnt get it to load either, it's not like it's giving me an error, it's just like i didnt even copy it. And i did it correctly unzip and master, and i downloaded the one you linked in post. I know my way around addons but this just wont show up, and i woule REAAAALLYYY love to have it.
---
Could anyone screen shot it so i can see how it look on your UI on live classic.
---
Claw sucks because you lose 3% hit. You can’t get +5 weapon skill to unarmed. If you are raged capped and using heroic strike every auto (Vael) then you should use Julie’s or Alcors for the 1.3 speed. Every other situation I’d rather use Quel as a human or an axe as an orc.
---
All of them are shit piles. What do you expect?
---
and that is the first argument we mostly get
---
It’s a gold sink to keep inflation down.  Just takes gold and removes it from the game.
---
Who keeps all the gold?
---
Did a UBRS with a guy named you. He kept winning greens and everything else thought they won.
---
I've done that farm probably 20-30 times in the last 2 days and I've only seen one book period.
---
Full clear it’s a competent guild looking to fill last few spots.
---
Not sure about #1, but for #2, do you have another nameplate addon? I use Threat Plates on top of ElvUI, and they don't mix. So I have to turn off ElvUI's built-in nameplate addon to let Threat Plates take over. Otherwise the first couple mobs I pass may have a plate, but the rest won't.
---
Also, make sure you turn on name plates in the standard UI settings for all new characters you make (I think there's a toggle for it, too, and on mine, it's V).
---
\*raises hand\*  It's a fun soap opera.  I love drama
---
No you
---
It’s not as good as private servers thought but it’s still BiS.
---
&gt; clearly getting stream sniped by the dude.
---
So what? Turn your stream off. If you broadcast your location to the world people are going to use that against you. The sense of entitlement is unreal.
---
Yes you are. Because i never said they weren't viable. Just that the extra dmg from the debuff is not your damage! Which is really hard to understand apparently
---
It’s not.  They both suck though.  Anyone supporting a twitch anything deserves to have their eyes removed.
---
When you have HS queued, for some reason your offhand white attacks have their miss chance reduced to that of the special attack penalty, rather than the dual wield penalty. Since you are likely hitcapped for special attacks, if you can properly master this technique, you are gaining a significant amount of additional rage from never/rarely missing offhand white attacks.

&gt;Lvl 1 alt on alliance with a /who Asmongold on repeat. 
---
obsessed
---
Plenty of posts have debunked it. It doesn't work and when it does it bypasses all kinds of safeties and checks that good code runs to make sure the players aren't hacking/exploiting the system.
---
Pservers all just one big hack fest since they throw all these safeties out the window.
---
That's the impact of the DKP system. It's a very minor upgrade for warriors but it's best in slot. Under a DKP system though, every point they have needs to be saved because weapons are critical to them. Instead of the minor bis items going cheap, they just go untouched.
---
Fuck Twitch
---
Yeah, Satyr bow from DM, Blackstone Ring from Mara,  Guard Captain Trink, Battleborn bracers from UBRS. UBRS has some other good upgrades for you as well; Valor Shoulders, Bracers from Rend, Draconian Deflector from Drak.
---
&gt;In no way has he ever streamsniped
---
So you're saying you've monitored his activity 24/7 and can definitely prove that he didn't stream snipe?
---
There's a difference between saying "he has never stream sniped" and saying "I see no evidence that he has stream sniped"..
---
Problem is that’s total population only, likely won’t be with battlegroup splits. Other problem is the % of each faction who actually queues for PVP BGs. Historically Horde has a higher % of people queue for BGs while the Alliance has a lower %. Which leads to longer queues for Horde.  
---
It’s the same with Classic. Most of the people on the underrepresented server, most of these people Alliance, are going to think “finally I can do shit out in the world for once”...which isn’t queuing for BGs.
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in PvP.
---
You're safest bet is to sell it now. The market is going to be flooded with twinks items from everyone who has been holding on to them thinking they would be worth more. I just saw a guy yesterday selling like 10 twink items in trade.
---
Shackle pulls are a thing there if your group can’t handle shit.
---
but we're not after phase 2 yet?
---
How is that even possible with getting punted every Wrath cooldown
---
Switch to defensive stance and tab sunder armor. search this thread. There’s a lot of advice about this
---
No, stay Firemaw. This is the biggest server. Just compare the amount of guilds which cleared MC - Firemaw has 68 while Ashbringer has only 37!
---
Flasks make the raid easier, faster and more convenient.  Are you use those each run?  You are complaining that a buff that can be received at any of those time periods and saved until you raid is subtracting from your experience?
---
You had the choice to move off the server.  You declined.  So live with "part of the game that's missing".
---
He wasn't sniping though? He literally explains his methods and that he never stream snipes. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLiNiOmS0b0
---
Blizzard created 5x bigger servers while keeping limited resources and buffs at the same rate.
---
The problem isnt people min maxing gameplay. The problem is TOO many people min maxing gameplay on one server. Fix it blizz
---
200 IQ
---
Thanks again!
---
No. Best Winter Squid rates are Bay of Storms, from noon to 6. Nightfin are best fished in the lake by Scholo or the elf lake in Hinterlands.
---
One is fresh water, one is salt, so no cross catches.
---
No way
---
Not raids.
---
Because quite frequently the top price of an item is not the current going rate. Many times I see markets set up like this, but if I put my price directly under the other pots it quickly gets buried down the other prices and very frequently no one buys it. Namely because it was a brief unusual spike in AH price.
---
So the person is used to selling pots for 2.1, they've followed market prices before and gotten buried in the past. So they set the price for what they know will sell and move on.
---
Warlocks got a lot of useful spells restricted to try to balance them for the CDL, but they still absolutely stomped with the highest winrate in every bracket.  
---
I'll be truly baffled if anyone but a warlock wins the tournament. If they didn't restrict any warlock spells, they would likely never have lost a duel.
---
How many hours of specific targeting of a player am I allowed to have before its considered griefing?
---
*laughs in tremor totem*
---
#DISPOSED OF
---
Obsession isn't streamsniping.  Harassment would be the proper term but even then, PvP in WoW is not specifically harassment.
---
Ya I'll make that claim. Only class that has any real chance is warrior. Definitely not rogue though.
---
This is what happens when your side of the server is afraid to go outdoors.
---
Longer on pvp servers :)
---
Warrior? Please tell me you’re kidding.
---
Its not on purpose at all. :D
---
Not me.  I predicted every blunder blizzard has made so far.
---
Not enough servers.
---
Transfers will inbalance server
---
Wpvp honor phase would be a disaster due to levelers getting non stop ganked
---
Hunter can disarm if they're Surv (pvp) spec after a parry.
---
Depends how much you're willing to dungeon grind, IMO.
---
If you spam ZF until you can do BRD Gorshak Farm it does pretty quick I think.
---
why don't you just give the damn players what they actually NEED TO RAID WITH, fuck your "removals" and fuck your gay ass copy right, I will upload it to the pirate bay 100 times and share the link everywhere so why dont you just f off and stop removing shit!!
---
Look! No one is hurting anyone! It's the implication.
---
Oh look, another person desperate for a reason to call someone “entitled.” 
---
You sound like an idiot
---
Yeah they are the left and right binding. Idk how this is news to anyone
---
I've been pvp'ing a lot probably why I'm at 7 days played already on my rogue.
---
It does but you make a lot more gold. So there's that.
---
You play on alliance? Or horde
---
Go orc
---
Also half that stuff is just broken private server jank and not doable on classic.
---
Imagine BFA getting re-released 15 years from now but heroic dungeons drop 385ilvl items from the very start
---
Newsflash not everyone lives on private server's and Reddit. Some just saw wow classic and booted it up.
---
that add-on is hideous
---
then classic people QQ about retail when their fire mage can't cast frostbolt, holy priest can't mindflay and arms warrior can't tank...
---
make up your mind will ya.
---
Nobody asked you &lt;3
---
My character is called Tanktank. People always asking "Who is tank?"
---
Stay ret, you can heal, tank and dps as ret while leveling
---
Wow what an interesting point you've not made at all!
---
Either one. Warlocks are busted in Classic with their overloaded toolkit.
---
If too many players on one server for buffs are a problem wouldnt black lotuses be the same problem? Flask are 4x-6x the price than in vanilla.
---
Also, you sound angsty. Server transfers being irrelevant to this post aside, the smallest classic server is still bigger than the biggest vanilla.
---
Mixer's sniping has done nothing for their viewer base. Everyone that has moved off Twitch has lost a massive portion of their audience. 
---
Facebook isn't even in the same race as the rest of the live streaming platforms.
---
It depends.  I have bad news if you are on a PVP server that isn't heavily balanced in your faction's favor and are playing a DPS class that may have a tough time finding a spot in dungeon runs or don't have a guild that has a large amount of people in your level range.
---

I had healed an ele to 3% Mana. Last two before he went oom killed me. I was about to go cat and kill him with my 75dps.
---
Heavy stone and iron bars sell big on every server no doubt.
---
Dancing troll village &lt;3
---
He has so much proof that he never streamsnipes
---
that'd be up for blizzard to decide
---
Don't judge us.
---
You'll do better with just some random green "of the bear" or "of the tiger" in your ranged slot.
---
So 1 out of 20 that has a Medium population because it's full of Alliance refugees ?
---
Ashkandi. Good community that's not the biggest, but there's plenty of us to run stuff any time.
---
The second best thing to finding broken tooth is to find someone taming him. Then you have a timer on when he's gonna be back the next time. So what that finnish dude did, makes no sense. Enjoy your little kitty!
---
Interesting. We transfered a few of us over. How are you guys sitting in terms of raid teams etc? We are looking to get new members and get MC farming back on again (We were doing MC in about 2 hours 10/10) 
---
If it's something you would be interested in pursuing (maybe teaming up) let me know.
---
But i am enjoying the server since i moved. I can actually mine and do some fair 1 v 1,  2 v 2 pvp etc
---
Not to mention that all the strats are known and perfected now. The fact that you need exactly 15 meatshields on Huhuran wasn't common knowledge. Having a lock tank Twins wasn't something obvious. A lot of people have vendored that frost dmg quest sword by the time AQ came out and everyone found out they'd need frost dmg.
---
C'thun's gonna die the first day the gates open in Classic. If servers manage to handle the whole thing that is.
---
It's also about learning when you must taunt...or that DPS should CC to help you regain/gain agg. I also swap thru targets to keep my agg spread across all the mobs. It's not the tanks job to kill...it to keep agg and protect the healer/help them have to heal fewer characters.
---
There have been some problems with chat the last couple of days, that may be it.
---
And here I am sitting with 9 successive hunter leafs in a row and 5 priests of whom none has the staff yet.
---
&gt; drop the head in the middle of the night just to get their items
---
My understanding is you can complete the quest whenever, it just doesn't give the buff if it's been less than six hours.
---
It's mind boggling how Blizzard managed to fuck Classic up this bad. Overpopulation in a game designed for 2500 players and no faction balance measures. The same people that thought cramming all of Europe in to two PvP servers was a viable solution. Makes me sick.
---
If you took economics 101 this wouldn't confuse you.  Either they're selling it for below market value I which case it's unsustainable and you can flip it for profit or everyone else is trying to sell for more than market value which creates opportunities for people to massively undercut you.
---
I thought the horde 2 hand meta was to spam hamstring to fish for windfury procs. Why would they dual wield?
---
I made it clearly, you sound like an idiot.
---
JuSt DoNt StReAm.
---
You realize that’s his job right?
---
F*ck every single one of them . Alliance on Ashbringer are the toxic pieces of cr*** everyone is speaking about making the game unplayable. Ganking lowbies and small groups in raid groups permanently, camping flightmasters,etc. , only difference to all other servers is that it’s the Alliance on Ashbringer that does it.
---
But he's complaining about a thing that existed during vanilla pretending it's new.  Server pop isn't the issue unless hisplan was to pop an ony head at like 4am on a thursday and stay logged out until his raid.
---
Even on my low pop server ony heads were up every day by raid times.  Maybe you get lucky and can pop it early enough and stay logged out that day, but you had to try to schedule around it unless you had pure dumbluck.  I know my guild did ony with our raid, and we had 2 alt raids.  I know two other guilds who did main/alt raids as well and then about 4-5 other guilds who did Ony.  I don't know how many other pug/alt raids there were, but I know at least about 10-15 Onyxia kills on my low pop server.  That number was going to be at least double to triple on a bigger server.  On a low pop server, if we planned some stupid time of day we could get the ony head.  On a larger server that became more difficult.
---
The issue isn't too many ony heads, the issue is people care so much more about the buff so they can clear MC faster.  Yes there are more ony heads making it even harder, but it was already something which was relatively difficult to get unless you planned for it.
---
Alliance. Horde has the numbers.  Discord is active. There seems to be a large population around the 20-40 LVL as it seems a wave came to is and I see alot of deadmines and SM in LFG. Amongst other lower level dungeons. If you hopped on now I bet you could ride that wave if you put in a good day to get to LVL 20 asap. If not I'm sure there's alot more.  My alt is level 5 right now too lol.
---
Same boat. I don't care who is Right or wrong about pvp servers. Just let me pay 30 bucks to get rid of this hell hole. I've sunken 200 hours into my priest, I can't just level a new one..
---
Are you seriously condoning death threats? Over a digital pet?
---
There’s so many rogues out there atm who just don’t get that they should be behind the target 90% of the time- try to tell them and all you get is flak about them not backstabbing, cause swords...omg, this alone counts for ignoring them when forming groups, and sure as fuck when raiding.
---
That idea works fine for things like pets, where someone might be watching an item to see if the price goes low enough for them to see it as a good deal
---
But for items like consumables, people are buying them because they need them, therefore they're going to buy the cheapest one regardless of what price it is, so listing it 50s cheaper than the next guy is doing nothing to make it sell faster, but is decreasing your own profit for no reason, and further tanking the market for everyone else selling that item.
---
Except it’s the opposite on Ashbringer. The alliance are the gankers and toxic corpse campers
---
No it doesn't feel as long. I think it goes a lot quicker especially when you start running dungeons a lot for your pre-bis. There are a lot of good dungeon quests and some quests in WPL and EPL give a lot of xp. 
---
The grind from 40-50 is probably the worst though.
---
the post i'm referring to is claiming the guy did NOT violate the TOS and did nothing wrong.
---
They've never done a realm merge. Only connected realms, and that sounds pretty anti-classic. But we'll have to wait and see.
---
Rogue on a PVE server is the definition of boredom. You bring nothing but dps.
---
If you dont like to get pinned on a healing role, stay away from shaman.
---
Hunter is good
---
I probably would craft a sageblade if I were maining prot pally
---
It depends on how you go about it, 
---
End game most of your Pre BiS raid gear comes from dungeons which if you can get into a group for, can net you a lot of exp while working towards raiding. This is mainly for 56 and up but BRD will be the only place you can do for xp once your in the low 50's
---
On the flip side of just questing, It should be a steady pace until you do hinterlands (need a group) and WPL stuff (no FP). Eventually you'll run out of quests to do and you'll need to grind out the remaining levels which you can dungeon grind out. 
---
I was a resto druid from 50-60 and BRD got stale for a while, once I hit 56 tho, the endgame was smooth being able to group in end game dungeons. It totally  seems faster since you are working towards end game gear and not just the levels.
---
Disposed of
---
Generally for pvp you want bursty damage over sustained damage. Because it's harder to react to a big burst of damage. So big slow weapons are pretty much always better in pvp. Also the MS debuff is pretty nice.
---
Are you talking about melee weaving, or full on melee? I'd curious to know your build and rotation for the latter.
---
If your Battle.net account is registered in the EU you won't be able to claim codes from other regions. As a workaround, you can make your purchase directly in the NA store (international and currency exchange fees may apply):

You've changed the topic / failed to read the entire thing you replied too twice now lol
---
My server has both shards and essences as cheaper than you list by about 1g each. That’s a pretty significant difference in profit. Getting herbs can often be a big slowdown depending on pathing, pods spawning lashers and such.
---
So with your numbers and my servers pricing, it’s actually more lucrative to solo farm lashers as a priest with herbalism than to do jump runs, unless there’s a lucky AC streak. For druid/shaman, jumps are definitely the way though.
---
Actually now that you mention it I recalled hearing that from people in-game. I guess they're doing it off hours just to make sure someone can take advantage of the buff then, that or they just didn't know they could do it whenever.
---
Gonna start now
---
As a pre 60 tank as long as stuff isnt hitting ur healer ur doing it right, aggro is a nightmare in classic so if ur dps pull threat thats on them, get aggro back if u can but prio #1 is keeping it off healer. Most people go full arms spec for lvling and just tank with a 2h wpn (throw on shield if its a big pull or low mana healer to stay alive) the reason this works well is because dmg delt is directly related to threat generated. Good warriors will hold threat while lvling by being the top dps for most pulls. Be in D stance for the bonus threat and dance to other stances for cds like whirlwind/sweeping strikes etc. 
---
 Tl:dr do more dmg to hold more threat. If dps pulls aggro get it back when u want more rage or just let them tank it
---
They already have faction specific free transfers off select realms for this.  
---
A queue does not help because it doesn't matter how small the pipe is to get in if they still get in. 
---
Concurrent online player count even per faction however would address the issue.
---
On Lucifron the Horde outnumbers the Alliance by something like 60:40 I think and still it's the Ally's camping the shit out of the Horde in DM and Blackrock whenever I go there. I guess Horde just cba to clean up regularly.
---
AND you shouldn’t be in front of the damn raid boss...EVER.
---
Confused at this question.  This is my main who has the gold you see and I have a bank at that has maybe 100g. My account has just about 160g left in liquid gold. I assume you think I’m a GL or something?
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=48&amp;realm=4731_Earthfury 
---
I'm not sure how accurate your numbers are.
---
&gt;"orc if you don't like stuns, UD if you don't like fear"
---
That's essentially the question you have to ask yourself, there really isn't much more to the question than that.
---
You're talking 2k active player servers to 10k. It's a massive difference.
---
I miss Eve, where stream sniping is a time-honored tradition.
---
Lions are the king of the jungle. Not Carebears
---
Large servers in vanilla already had this problem, so it isn't something new.  The problem is players care so much more about raid clear time parses they want the buff.  This isn't a new issue, the new thing is player behavior.
---
That one Indian guy...
---
Yeah I thought I remembered they could but I don't play hunter so I wasn't sure.
---
Best of luck friend! I'm travelling for the next week or so and can't be online but DM me your tag. I'll add you and we could level together possibly.
---
Logging off / exiting the game so I can focus on real life.
---
Insanely difficult as a college student, much easier as an adult with a job &amp; bills &amp; real responsibilities.
---
When considering PvP, you gotta keep in mind that you likely won’t be able to stay on your target very easily. Warriors are easy to kite. This means, you need to hit as hard as possible whenever you can get to your target. This is where the extra crit damage from the Arms tree really helps. Attack speed is nice, but just isn’t very reliable for PvP in my opinion.
---
It's largely a status symbol and also part of the concept that no one really knew what they were doing, even blizzard.
---
I mean people keep repeating faction queues to force transfers even when majority of the servers are horde dominated and as such impossible to balance even with transfers...
---
It looks cool as shit, and procs are always pretty good in PVP for extra burst. Especally on paladin or shamans
---
I bought a Kroll Blade for 250 when I hit 60 on Whitemane A and used it until I got my MC daggers and went dags instead of swords. It was worth it 10 times over.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't either. But there is a lot of undeserved hate for Asmond. People don't realize it's all a persona. 
---
Yes stream sniping is against twitch ToS, but it's very hard to prove that he's stream sniping. Especially when it's Asmond who has like 2 raids of aspergies following him. It's kinda hard to not know where he is.
---
How do you explain all the rogues in duel tournament not getting perfect records LUL
---
Having a mount definitely makes it feel faster at times, however, going by the math; 42 is half way to 60, experience wise.
---
[deleted]
---
To be fair, we knew there would be a large chunk of the population that the statement was true about. It was undeniable that some people had rose tinted goggles on.
---
Unless the queues get very long there's no point in going since you still have to queue at the battlemasters.
---
&gt; This forces anyone who wants to receive the ony buff to all raid at the same odd time.  
---
thats not true at all  
---
do what everyone else does - log on, get buff, log off
---
I mained a mage back in those days. I remember the best way to tell who had the better mage gear was to see who had the most mana because int was all you were going after.
---
Its against twitch tos to harass other partners. His stream was literally dedicated to shitting on another partner.  He didn't moderate his chat either, so it simply became 1-2k people saying some of the worst shit in a circle jerk about asmon/esfand and some of the other streamers.
---
Do you smell burnt toast?
---
.... you mean the people literally watching asmon's stream and shouting his location every second in chat and him asking about it? He /was/ stream sniping, he no longer needs to.
---
Add barroom shanked grind to the fun.  Screw swords
---
Been having issues doing lashers as a druid... my hurricane does absolutely zero damage, doesn't say anything, like I didnt cast it over them yet I did.
---
I have the gear to kill them to bear form but it takes forever
---
Yeah like fucking 5 times already. This is a tired ass post.
---
Yeah it did, more than once
---
Hmm interesting. I've also had frost traps cause aggro, so now if I FD and mobs still have the frost trap movement debuff, I try to wait until the debuff falls off. But it doesn't happen every time which is weird. FD is just tricky. I usually wait an extra 5 seconds or so to pop out of it because I've had too many instances where I FD, drop combat, stand back up and immediately regain agro for some reason.
---
You keep saying smaller server like that's a solution over vanilla servers which were still smaller.
---
Out of everyone posting in here, I think yours are the least intelligent and make the least sense. I'm on the side of dont change it, but you just sound like s player in one of the megaguilds being a baby over your monoply.
---
Well there's literally thousands of guilds raiding right now. Someone had to get lucky.
---
If he got banned for harassment it is all good.
---
But if he got banned for the fact that he is a small streamer and big streamer wanted him gone.... than many people should care.
---
You aren't wrong, but neither is he.
---
You're correct, it's not his damage. He didn't deal the damage. He is also correct though, that without him that additional damage would not have occurred. In that sense, he *is* responsible for that damage.
---
The warlock casting CoE is responsible for increasing your damage by 5%. 
---
When you spec for winter's chill, you're directly increasing the damage of the other mages, you are responsible for that increase even if you didn't deal it yourself.
---
It's almost like raiding is a team sport and there is more to understanding a parse than simply looking at individual dps numbers alone.
---
Yes it happens in roughly .16% of MC clears. Given how many millions of times the place has cleared, it has happened thousands of times.
---
This doesn't affect much in the lower ranks, but can completely negate a whole week's efforts come Rank13-14 grind.
---
&gt;You keep deleting memes for low effort, even if they’re not. Can you just let the community be the judge of if it’s funny or not?
---
I was with you with every word you wrote, right up until this part...WTF. It's like you're contradicting yourself.
---
If you want to solo PVP, neither. I suggest you to rethink your class choice or your playstyle
---
&gt; all a persona
---
#MASHES X TO DOUBT

I'm surprised it took this long for him to get warned/suspended.
---
Link to fishing vid? ;)
---
Dwarf Fortress is also mostly played paused.
---
you need to go Ele now. 
---
I used to argue with everyone who said Enhance isn't viable and just go ele and say enhance is perfectly viable (which it is).
---
but when i swapped spec at 44 from enhance to ele i knew how wrong i was. 
---
Enhance i could kill 2-3 mobs (3 at the VERY max) before needing to eat/drink. since switching to ele i can kill 6 EASILY and often kill 8-9.
---
in enhance PVP i was ganked by higher levels and just saw 'miss' 'miss'. in ele i actually do damage even to 60's!
---
yesterday for example. two rogues camping people in camp mojache, i see him eating and at about 30% hp. i pop my CD's and ONE SHOT him. I am a level 48 shaman taking (atleast) 30% of a level 60's health in one shot....
---
Go ele my bro you will not regret it. 
---
you can always switch back if you don't like it. but you HAVE TO try it.
---
That means it's also his job to get stream sniped you fucking dump truck.
---
/facepalm
---
Also having rogues that can go solo the torch guys and vanish, then just casually walk to the braziers.
---
Insane though! Thankful for it.
---
I know this feeking well.

u/Packattack8585 transferred realms after he complained of lag ruining the fun of PvP (when no one else noticed the lag he had).
---
Other than that, there's a ton of negative posters that just aren't active on Reddit anymore.
---
Haha so true. Our luck is strong.
---
Only for solo play. With a pocket healer warriors are killing machines
---
Thanks dude! Nutty!
---
Transfer to where, Pve? Have you looked at the realm populations? Majority of pvp players are Horde. You could divide all Horde and Alliance players evenly on all pvp realms and you'd end up with every realm being Horde majority.
---
And the history of forums and online communties has shown us that "letting the community sort it out" will ultimately lead to the exact opposite of what you think it will.   
---
The reality is, people that actually care about quality content will just leave until all that you are left with is low quality shit posts.
---
It's part of the add-on, but you can change fonts inside the add-on too and I'm pretty sure it's not the default one.
---
Which prevents active entrepreneurs like OP from undercutting, actually allowing you to sell anything at all, right?
---
You're not decreasing your profit, because if you undercut by 1c, the guy you're undercutting will undercut you by 1c as well. You won't be bothered to recall the items and repost, and he can just spam the ah with it because he has a ton of stacks for it. So you're just going to end up paying the deposit fee and getting the items back, instead of selling for a theoretical loss. 
---
I understand both sides, but really can't agree with people that complain about this approach.
---
Novelty and status.
---
There are a lot of factors that go into a pvp fight that I can't really say for sure.
---
With a full round of CDs 1v1s vs Warriors and Paladins are quite winnable.  If they are packing FAPs and LAPs is becomes much much harder, but you can still do it.
---
SL locks will always be the class that will give you the most trouble, they have enough tankiness that you can't burst them down and their pet prevents you from using blind to reset the fight (unless you use prep and double blind the pet).
---
Why did I read this in the voice of Ali G?
---
It's pretty fucking clear he was stream sniping. When he started streaming though and getting followers why would he? He had a few hundred people doing it for him and telling him exactly where to find the person he's going after.
---
2h is better for bigger hits. At that level, both arms and fury are viable so it depends on how you want to play. 
---
Although be prepared to get stomped if you don’t have a healer with you
---
Dude he kills him when he’s not streaming. People with two accounts messages him all day asmons location
---
It doesn't matter if its a persona - that's the face he presents to the world and this that is what he is judged by. For all intents and purposes, that's who he is. What happens off camera is completely irrelevant.
---
happened to my guild like 2 weeks ago.
---
They could pay chinese gold farmers for a tonn of gold. Then hand that gold out to every player. Then people wouldn't need to farm so much, and there would be shorter ques. Eeeh, what was the problem again..?
---
Yea I rerolled from Stalagg horde to grob and I’m having a great time. The allies are friendly and no one is toxic.
---
They can set limits on where they draw the line. The slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy. One change doesn’t immediately mean they’re guaranteed to lead to retail. If so, we’re already fucked because they changed mailing multiple items at once.
---
It’s not shortening the grind, it’s transferring the aim. Do you not think people stop playing because of the gold farm grind and that they’d prefer to spend that time on another grind?
---
Imagine making a conscious decision to play on the streamer server and then leaving that due to over population and imbalance, only to imbalance other previously BALANCED servers with an influx of mouth breathers. I have no sympathy for people om Faerlina we all knew that was going to be the streamer server before Classic even released and everything that comes with it. Now all these new alliance guilds have completely wrecked the balance. Its not fun for the alliance and certainly not fun for the horde. The first week of Phase 2 was great before the imbalance came
---
What the fuck? Didnt asmonbald post on twitter that he is done with classic and going back to retail?
---
As others said,  gear doesn't matter for trib farming. Just wont be as efficient.  There's some good upgrades in there for you anyway.  
---
Mara is definetely more gear dependant.
---
Just be prepared for dying multiple times as you learn the tribute solo mechanics.  Even better geared hunters have to go through that trial.
---
I don't think it is that "Blizzard **will** not credit lost honor" it is more that Blizzard can not credit lost honor. It would appear that support cannot at least, they lack the means to do so.
---
Functionally though, it still sucks and I am glad I am not on that grind at the moment
---
Fuck, you'd get better "drama" watching 2 chimps fling shit at each other.
---
You don’t get it for the stats. You get it for the glory and the purpose of showing it off.
---
Its gonna sink in value after Naxx or ZG(?) patch as water will fall off and others will be needed for crafting stuff so better to sell it for 2k now i think \^\^
---
So you're saying we should cater to minmaxers and not try replicate original vanilla? You're ignoring queue times, lag in major cities, etc. 
---
You should whiner than OP
---
What the fuck are you even talking about.
---
The guy is bitching that it's hard to get an ony head and it should be changed.  It isn't hard to get the buff, you just have to find a time one will be dropped.  He doesn't have to drop a head to get the buff, only be in the city.  Him bitching that it is too hard is stupid because he is literally saying it happens all the time.  What he is bitching about is that he can't drop the head whenever he wants and get the buff.
---
I am saying that was a fucking problem on much smaller servers 14 years ago.  For people make this request now is the epitome of why the idea of a "vanilla experience" is bullshit.  People are approaching classic like it is retail and it is being treated the same.  Everyone needs to be entirely on their terms, not the game or other players.  Anything inconvenient to them MUST be changed.  Every problem is related to something that is blizzard's fault.
---
If he wants to get an ony buff, he can do the exact same shit we did in vanilla.  Figure out when the next one will be dropped and be in SW/Org for it.  That isn't what the wants though.  He wants to get the ony buff off HIS turn in and the exact time HE wants.  That isn't something we reliably got to do in vanilla.  Why change that now?
---
Getting someone banned for steam sniping is an entitled move. You think some smaller streamer getting sniped could get Twitch to do that? No.
---
You're broadcasting to the world. Deal with it.
---
Whether you like his voice or not is not relevant to this topic.
---
I'm curious to the exact reason that he got banned. If it was clear harrassment so be it. But if it was bigger streamers using their platform to make it happen it is a big problem
---
Isn't it always MH? That's how Sword Spec/HoJ/ThrashBlade work.
---
Why the change if you are done leveling? Whats the problem?
---
wrath of rag is seriously bugged right now, and intercept exists.
---
I'm not here to defend people pulling arbitrary numbers out of their ass. I'm here to prove that you're completely wrong and that you grossly misunderstood layering even though it's been very clearly laid out for months. 
---
Okay, census data on that site uses a /who chain. Fair enough, I'm not AS correct. But that chain will still not pull everybody and even if it did, the number on the server is almost twice what you seem to think it is. 
---
When your entire argument comes down to screeching at me that you're wrong but not as wrong as I'm telling you you are, maybe it's time to step back and take the L. It's ok to admit you're wrong now and again.
---
Alright, Noone is feral, You heal and They will dps. Who will range?  No, Who couldn't make it tonight, family obligations.
---
This title was very misleading. It reads like an announcement.
---
It's stupid. There's a rogue on my server that only got viewers because my whole guild decided to join his stream and snipe his alt for a whole day.
---
Best fun we had in a while, and he's been nothing but nice about it! ❤️
---
&gt; Then he have to deal with it... 
---
Based on the original post it appears that he has dealt with it.
---
&gt;apostrophe’s   
---
&gt; make’s  
---
I know you're doing this on purpose but I'm still shaking and crying.
---
The evidence is his video that provides his explanations and methods on how he finds asmon. Do you have video evidence of a cam behind himself directly stream sniping?
---
Yeah, but it's only an issue in one direction.  They don't want you to level and farm on a PvE server and then take all your stuff to a PvP server to unfairly compete against people who came up the hard way.
---
Transferring from a PvP to a PvE server is just taking in a refugee.
---
Ur not ok dude
---
For druids it's 1 bear, 1 cat, 2 resto and 1 boomkin.  
---
So theoretically it's possible to bring 5 druids :)  
---
5 paladins on other hand it's overkill.
---
Yeah but the wall skip method can be done with any group with some aoe.
---
This 😂
---
If you're the only seller, set the price.
---
BWL maybe the first half unless it's very vetted. AQ40...questionable without very stringent raider requirements.
---
I’m pretty sure they are nature immune. I don’t think solo lasher farming is very lucrative for druids (I think shaman are cut off too). Jump runs and Mara farms are good for druids though. If you have herbalism, you can make decent gold in Mara with ghost mushrooms and tinker/princess, especially if you sell the pieces.
---
This name is stupid. 
---
I would make him change it if i was his GL.
---
If you don’t have your epic mount what’s stopping you from playing on a different server?
---
What add on give you that info bar at the top of the screen?
---
Sick! Maybe It's because more people are clearing MC more often.
---
I have a very serious question and I want you to explain it to me as thoroughly as you can.
---
What was this guys complaint before it was deleted?
---
I want to know if you actually know what he said and why he is a fucking idiot.  You have an agenda to push and I don't think you understand why he is an idiot either.  So please tell me exactly what he wanted and I'll tell you why he is an idiot.
---
If pvp. Join grobbulus either faction. If you want  pve and US based. I’d reccomend Pagle horde (pls not alliance, if alliance pls don’t come to Pagle)
---
oh this post again cool
---
titan panel
---
In potato res only please.
---
once.
---
It must be hard going through life and being so dumb. I’m sorry. If you think there is a counter to getting zerged running to dungeons you must not play the game.
---
Specific groups do, not everyone. I think it's 10 people, most of which will be melee.
---
MC wasnt getting cleared this much back in the day. I dont remember seeing all these Legendaries back in the day
---
True! The layout is nice aswell. Feels more like a big ass village though.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?  He's the min/maxer who wants shit catered to him.  You don't even know what point you have.
---
Do me a favor and please tell me what this guy wanted.
---
You have some randomass agenda to push and are going for it even though your argument makes no sense at all.
---
Please tell me exactly what it is that this guy wanted and why he should get it?
---
Brackets are set up 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.
---
Idk why people like the 30-39 bracket, though. Seems like most people either do 19 or 60 to me.
---
Might as well sell it. It’s going to take a months of transmutes for it to begin turning a profit over just selling the recipe for that amount.
---
oh shit.. sorry.  I got out of place on my comments, I guess.. carry on.
---
Wow I would of thought the same with the imp. Well you live and learn haha
---
No, it isn’t, lol. Paparazzi’s follow you in your **personal life**, ie when you **aren’t acting**.
---
Streamsnipers don’t do shit when you aren’t working.
---
They are entirely different in every meaningful way.
---
Who gives a fuck about these basement trolls on twitch really?  Most of them are obnoxious little turds.  
---
Why do a lot of you seem to worship at the altar of their collect nutsacks?
---
Gotta work on those crystal now
---
I rolled pvp for the world pvp, I'm currently in the shit hole right now but it'll work out maybe 
---
Was running back to FP in hinterlands after getting ZF Mallet.  Healer and I walked over about 7 horde all In a tight area, was kinda sad.
---
How can I help support this man.
---
To be honest I've seen way less pvp server people harping on pve players and much more pve players smelling their own farts about rolling pve lol.
---
lol twitch mods are such pussies
---
But that dark edge of Insanity
---
In Orgrimmar... while horde are dominating... go see what SW or IF are like. I'm not saying the game is dead, but looking at it from a horde perspective is seriously looking at it through rose tinted goggles
---
It's good for pvp and looking badass, but that's about it.
---
done "streaming" classic, he'll still play classic offline, and he's gonna be there all the time
---
I think he's joking since shards disappear on log out.
---
Killing a rival Hunter in the way to BT is okay though right?
---
It's in the TOS of twitch, not sure what you're trying to imply here.
---
Y'know, except the literal nazis
---
Hakkar loves this
---
Good idea but would likely be a heavy lift in terms of developing that.  Much easier to just release BGs early, which is there intended solution.
---
I generally prescribe 3x daily back washes for this
---
Same!
---
On it!
---
Great to see things I will never own, thanks for the list!
---
I think the appeal is that it’s the highest level twink bracket without mounts. Could be wrong but that’s my guess.
---
Not sure I enjoy healing as much as I thought I would. Don’t get me wrong I’m not totally bored but I find myself checking out every lock that walks by and wondering if I should have gone that route. On top of that I’m not currently enjoying stepping out of IF on my server.
---
I play in the minority and again your assuming I’m camping.   I’m on the boat so the pvpers come to me and I don’t go to them.    Once again.  There’s people that will sit and wait till somthing happens and there’s people like me that make shit happen.    There’s people that bitch and moan and there’s people like me that understand that this game has a living world.      Does heart seeker have a que?   If yes I don’t pay to wait sorry, that’s truly pathetic.
---
Omg you have a reddit account
---
http://imgur.com/a/DoembKU
---
Yeah, I've come to that conclusion. I'm overall okay with everything. I actually just laugh when I have to corpse crawl my way to a dungeon. It's gone from frustrating to amusing for me. And honestly, a lot of times I'm just impressed. So, I've cooled myself down over the weeks since P2 rolled out and I'm not so bothered by it now. I try to pvp when I can. But I have become a tad more battle hardened... so I kill red no matter what level. I used to leave lower levels alone, but I get killed on my main and lower level alt no matter what level now so, if its red.. it's dead.
---
laughs in Hakkar
---
HAHAHAHAH
---
Because mace spec sucks
---
Really weirds me out how everybody has open spots on their action bars now.
---
You don't have 3 bound? Wtf is going on?!

Air elementals in Northwest Silithus? I only farmed them when I needed mats for Robe of the Archmage. The drop rate was super inconsistent and I had to farm 2hrs super late at night (to avoid competition) for a single essence to drop.
---
THANK YOUUUU! I’ve always wonder wtf a “Twink” was and didn’t feel like making a post asking would be appropriate here lmao! So there’s nothing particularly special about 30-39?

Could I get some advice on making my bear better? Tanking All dungeons, and Off tanking MC, Racing to tank Ony in Phase 3.

Here is my current setup.

I'm debating putting on my blademasters leggings  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12963/blademaster-leggings](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12963/blademaster-leggings)  just to get me to 5% hit.
---
I don't like having to wear the blackstone ring, but can't afford to lose the +hit.
---
I'm pretty beefy, but my threat can be slow to get started (early missed maul, or crazy hard dps)
---
Single target and bosses without a threat dump, I've got them hard locked to me after the second Maul. 
---
More than 3 targets with aggressive A/E really boils down how long the dps waits to start, if I'm chasing around a shit show, or controlling a pack.
---
Targeted harassment? I think that goes both ways with the things Asmon has said about advertise. Advertise specifically showed how a lot of these deaths came about. I'm not sure why Twitch is sticking their hands in this mess, its clear Asmon and Esfand are just babies raging that their hypocrisy led to their demise.
---
Sorry I mean does the raid organizer get the gold that's bid? I've never been in a gold dkp type run
---
What behaviour? They are just playing the game and the Alliance is doing *literally* the same on Alliance majority realms. It has nothing to do with being Horde. If you want to rank you have to get honor and you need to get more than others to rank faster. "baseless" ad hominem when your entire post was just a baseless ad hominem.
---
Damn they are apparantly. Didnt know that, since that's how I made most of my money on private servers.

Jump runs seem kinda whack for me, gonna try out mauradon

Doing that on an alliance account is against wow's tos. He presumably streamed himself breaking the games tos, which is against Twitch's tos. Easy ban
---
That’s what I was thinking but why would it be more fun without mounts?
---
Go for it, you want 1 for the locks anyway and the 1 we’re rolling with is generally atleast top 10 in terms of dps. You need some more consumes tho, keep that in mind.
---
Uhh wasnt there a post like a month ago about a double binding?
---
Why did you type this comment?
---
Noone has ever said that classic is a dead game. Stop craving attention
---
I see a lot of people talk about how fun shamans are to play. I’m not too great at the game and want to know if I should even bother trying shaman. Does it take an exceptional amount of skill to play them well?
---
&gt; Pug may struggle in naxx, but aq is really easy
---
This is way off. APES and other guilds will kill C'thun in 3 hours but Pugs are not going to be clearing AQ for a LONG time. It's going to kill a lot of guilds as well.
---
Not really sure.
---
The other guy mentioned it's the last bracket without mounts. It's also the last bracket before you anyone can get your 31 point talent (Mortal Strike, Ice Barrier, etc).
---
In the original comic, the text said "Wearing some really nice socks"
---
Listed at 300g on my server, not selling, suspect price it would go for in trade is under 100g as green “frozen” staff can have higher + damage
---
See, imagine if Advertise wasn't able to beat Asmongold, I doubt he would have reported because it creates a nice story-line in his favor. He's just mad that his plan to take over the server has been stomped out, and he needs to blame someone.
---
But they have 0 evidence that any stream sniping happened. Griefing? What about people who can't play the game from being flight path camped? They are just crying like babies because for once they don't have anything handed toi them
---
you're joking except mages could kite naxx trash around for an hour with rank 1 blizzard fishing clear procs until it died to solo farm their ring on private servers, but it wont be possible anymore because of spellbatching
---
The living bomb is on... EVERYONE
---
I could see how that would cause some problems lol
---
Truuuuue never really thought about that
---
It's not just Fire resist gear, patch 1.12 added +spell damage and +healing to a TON of blues that didn't used to have it. When MC was released Int stacking was the meta.
---
The reason you pull with CC is so that you can drag the mobs away from the CC'd target so no idiot breaks it accidentally.
---
Same when I see this one
---
&gt; People don't realize it's all a persona.

&gt;FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER I'M THE LITERAL GOD OF BIG DICK DAMAGE

&gt;wow, what a moron
---
&gt;DUDE IT'S JUST A PERSONA!!!!!
---
Depends on youe class really. Its a lot easier smashing lvl 31s in greens when you're 39 in full twink gear. But at 41 they'll have a mount and run away from you.
---
lighten up, ya goof
---
Had a guildie warrior who was on his alt healing a Strat run. I said I'm going to charge into that 4 pack and he said you can pull it as a 3 pack. I didn't know that but my go to answer is 'don't tell me what to do' or 'you're not my supervisor'. Well I thought the joke was understood since I said it on Discord but he whispers me apologizing! I had to explain I wasn't serious and I appreciate any advice he's gonna give me.
---
Sometimes you learn from those who have been doing it awhile, sometimes you learn from those who just started. Who cares where the lesson came from as long as you learned it?
---
Yeah, but its not coming for a while and its not orange
---
Except he's directly interacting with people, not taking part in an act. It isn't simply an act for entertainment. When you are a dick to someone in the real world, it makes you a dick regardless of your intent.
---
If I want to buy something, and see that people have been undercutting by 1c...I keep looking until I find someone who undercut by a decent amount and buy theirs instead.
---
He used asmon's name in his title multiple times, watched asmons vods on stream to shit on him and get his chat riled up, and didn't moderate any of the awful shit they said.  Doesn't really matter how anyone feels about asmon, it against ToS.
---
My friend's name is really shitty, "Urmombeatsme."  The rest of us have cool names.  Being that we are on an RP server, if I report him do you think mods might force him to change it?
---
Please roll alliance, lots of horde are rerolling here and you can tell, when looking at the lower levels, that it won't stay balanced for long.
---
Our tank has a character named You in the guild just to kick him and make people freak out. "You has been removed from the guild."
---
The problem has been that Asmon has repeatedly exclaimed how he's a pvp god and his raids will shit on the horde. So they just showed him hes not. If he wouldn't say shit like this he would be less likely to be targeted as a self proclaimed leader of the alliance
---
In no reality is ganking someone repeatedly harassment though. It's clear that they just didn't want their favorite boy whining.
---
Just use a 2h in defensive stance. You'll do much better. And dont go prot!
---
Yeah I vaguely recall one guild getting all 3 legendaries in one raid.
---
And yet, you hang out on a wow classic sub reddit.
---
I tried giving it a different name and it won’t work, seems to work with a different icon though which I find strange. Thanks!
---
He said he’s gets those messages all day everyday.
---
Do you feel better now?
---
Well you have E-body or N-body. Otherwise you could call them EB or NB, tehe.
---
So cringe
---
Dude...its just reddit... go outside your looking like a fool
---
Does anyone know if multiple Gnomish cloaking devices share a cooldown?  Could I theoretically have multiple cloaks in my bags and swap between them?  What about having 2 equipped and using them one after another?
---
Its the first level you can use 30 pt talents.
---
If he gets mass reported it could work.
---
For save the princess you want probably 57+.  Emp is 59, and the fight is healer stressed.  You need someone who can kick the princess too, and your tank needs to be able to hold aggro on emp.
---
That said, here's a strat that will make it a lot easier.  First, have a ranged DPS pull aggro on princess, and use the two side balconies to kite her forever.  A mage works great for this because of CS, I've also had a spriest do it successfully.  If they take damage you can heal them in between runs of the platform, your healer should be positioned on the floor and never move.  Your kiter will just run up, let princess get close and then jump down and go to the other platform and repeat.
---
Second, for emp, you want your tank to tank him on the platform right in front of the throne.  Your healer will never move so its important to not LOS by standing too far back.  When emp enrages (he gets big), jump down, and then 'juggle' emp side to side.  For example, if he starts running right to get at you, go left so that he turns around and starts running left.  Basically you want to just waste time while he's enraged, at that point he's immune to spells anyway.  When the enrage is over just reposition in front of the throne again to repeat the cycle.  Your healer will OOM if you force him to heal through the enrage, I basically had to chain max rank gheal with +440 heal gear and I still went OOM before 50% HP.
---
The higher geared your group, the more you can just stand and interrupt princess while doing emp, though basically because your tank has to kite emp your melee DPS will end up offtanking princess (had a rogue and enh shammy do it on two attempts, still worked out though).
---
That said, your group is mostly too low, you'll get too many misses on emp.  The casters at 54 and 55 will all get resisted, tank wont hold aggro over the amount of heals your healer will need to do, etc.
---
Because you can’t right click dismiss totems. Ty
---
population across all the servers:
---
52% alliance  
---
48% horde
---
it's just that all the carebear alliane flocked to PVE servers. 
---
But BGs are cross-realm.  It's looking likely that Alliance will end up having longer queues.
---
If enough people report him he might get a name change, just one won't cut it imo
---
Yes but you'd be a shitty friend.  Just ask your friend to report himself it will be fine the result will be the same
---
Stones for blasting powder for grenades too.
---
&gt;Hes a condescending basement dweller
---
I'm not a huge Asmon fan, but I've watched a few of the videos on his "Real life" channel, and he actually lives upstairs in his mom's house because she is disabled and relies on him completely to take care of her. At this point he has plenty of money to move out, but stays to make sure she's taken care of.
---
Think what you will of his stream, but I always thought that was a pretty stand-up move. It's not easy caring for a disabled family member.
---
If you duo it with a friend and have herb,mine, and enchanting between you, it can be decent money if you split it evenly.
---
But for solo, Mara might be one of your best bets. Might could look up a solo guide for druids. Probably a decent stealth path to take through one of the sides for mushrooms, leading you to princess area? I don’t know druid stuff sadly, only that they are boned for lashers.
---
Why does fear always make you walk to the most glitched out places?
---
Hope he sues. Especially when they have Asmon's officers on twitch threatening to shut down Horde guilds and acting like this.

Get her amacro mouse and you can go through whole rotations with one click on the mouse. It might be against the TOS but nobody gets banned due to it.
---
They're shit in classic. Much better in BC.
---
I like the memes yea.
---
Someone is still doing respec.
---
Do it up. Worst case scenario is you don't like Warlock as much as you think and you have a lvl 60 priest waiting for you.
---
Cool.
---
Who's asmongold?
---
As a Holy Priest, is my job in current world pvp to eat all the CC, or be instantly deleted?
---
I would classify things like 30min cooldowns as bad behavior, and all consumables are definitely frowned upon.  I think the only exception would be a warlock using their own healthstone
---
You act like just rerolling is an easy thing.... Most people would rather quit than start over.
---
You have to ignore him because he wants to parrot some bullshit excuse about why classic isn't the glorious vanilla experience he wanted.
---
These people don't want vanilla, they want a retail version of vanilla where they can play the game entirely on their terms.  THey want to ignore problems vanilla had, like this very one.  They was to ignore the fact that shit like flasks are expensive because raids are tryharding for clear times.  No, none of that matters, the Blizzard problem of the day is over populated servers.
---
The problem is never driven by player behavior, it's also somehow blizzard's fault.
---
&gt;Yawn, nothing better to do with your time? Problem is people like you, who think anybody gives a shit what they say.
---
You are literally on a forum where people are discussing opinions, lmao.
---
At 39 you've got enough spells and abilities to make it a little more fun to just shit on everyone around you. Plus there's enough really nice gear plus enchants to make you really op. I did it in vanilla with a hunter. Wrecking dudes with my bow of searing arrows was awesome.
---
No they don't
---
If you're horde come to ashkandhi it's nice
---
Most Advertise fans are Asmon fans as well...
---
You can’t possibly be that naive to think he has never even once streamsniped. Let’s be real with ourselves here for a second, his following is based off of a hate circle jerk and that alone. You would have to extremely out of touch to genuinely think this guy is the innocent victim.
---
Lol I'm new to Heartseeker on the Horde side. Me, my brother, and a few friends decided to try Classic after years of not playing WoW. We rolled Alliance back in the mid-2000s and we wanted to feel like the game was new again. We're all level 21-25 (rogue, hunter, mage, druid, and warrior) and Monday night decided to take the zeppelin to STV and run north to Deadmines. What a harrowing experience. We were brutally chased and beaten along the way trying to get into the instance. Hella fun though. HAHA
---
Gold managing, communicating with randoms or party members for a friendly environment, and picking smarter routes to quest and turn in. 
---
I used to fly across the continent just to submit one or 2 quests, then fly back to another quest hub, waste of time. When I was doing stuff like ST/Princess Run/BRD back in day, I didn't say much when there was something I disagreed with because A) Someone else always appeared to know what they were doing, but sometimes they don't.  B) Most players I feel are older. They played it back in 05 so most are mature and more patient

&gt; Its also hilarious that the #nochangers want TBC so much, an expansion that literally changes everything.
---
An expansion that was the natural historical progression of the World of Warcraft?  That one?  I think you don't understand the general concept that is \#nochanges and just needed something to blame.
---
I heard there are no laggs on medium servers. Check if you can transfer there.
---
*millionare basement dweller
---
There you go dick riding streamers again.
---
I’ve been leveling both a warlock and a Druid. I can’t decide which one to focus on as I enjoy them both. Is there one I should prioritize over the other in regards to leveling and gearing once they reach 60?
---
😔 you got me.
---
OK.
---
wtf you talking about ?
---
Asmon started it. Remember the whole " Alliance will own this server and  will allow Horde  the privilege to entering zones " speech
---
Sure but I think no other flight path passes by them quite like that. And the path in question is druid class only. I'm not sure but even the horde druid path might not show it either going in a different direction maybe.
---
Yes it wouldn't have been difficult to explain if they could type correctly.
---
Can blind miss even with hit cap?
---
Why would you blue out his name. 
---
Show us our try king.
---
Imagine being able to PoM Pyro into a full shatter..... hnnnggg
---
Ouch, the chances of that happening are around 0.2%
---
Well they probably cater towards the larger streamers because they make them more money asmon is just a hypocrite there are multiple clips of him saying that he will bully the horde of the server gank them until they DC , corpse camp them etcetera etcetera ....
---
All faction queues do is punish people who arent necessarily the problem.
---
To make you feel better. Yet you cant see the irony of asking for what you're asking for
---
You sound like an idiot.
---
Blizz should have insisted on faction balance from the start. Now we have a quagmire.
---
Dont tell that to enhance shammies.
---
It's the best time in the game for one faction on each server.
---
I feel like this is completely different. The raids fighting eachother is literally the purpose of PvP servers, fun epic fights. not targetting one guy 24/7
---
you've ever seen a grown man naked?
---
Yes, but are you saying you can definitely prove he has never once looked at Asmon's stream while looking for him?
---
IMO this is baby brained, cry to mama style thinking. If you're playing a massively multiplayer PvP game then prepare for any and all possibilities. If you're STREAMING your own gameplay to tens of thousands of people then you should expect AND patiently deal with every manner of in game harassment.
---
I'm man enough to admit I was wrong. I wish I had picked PvE. I didn't predict how things would be different
---
He did moderate his chat though, I was there most of the time and they barely talked crap about Esfand or Asmon, only when they cried for getting ganked.
---
You’re in ironforge...dudes just trying to keep trespassers out.
---
nochanges lost in May 2019 when layering was announced. The fact that you're blaming people who wanted a good experience for Blizzard completely botching it says to me that you have a bad combination of frustration and lack of insight.
---
Hm, I must be remembering incorrectly then. It's been awhile since I played a lock in Vanilla.
---
I understand her pain. Some of my clients are stuck with very little movement. The best thing she can do is sleep a lot during the healing process. It'll cure her boredom, but it'll also allow the body to repair itself a little bit faster.
---
who thought harassing someone was a banable offense
---
What has asmon said thats harassment? And what demise?
---
&gt;You have to ignore him because he wants to parrot some bullshit excuse about why classic isn't the glorious vanilla experience he wanted.
---
I am pretty sure I stated that most of the changes Blizz has already made to the game has been great, and I also said that I really like the game. I knew what I was getting into and have no grudges. Somethings could be done better however.
---
&gt;These people don't want vanilla, they want a retail version of vanilla
---
Nah, pretty sure the changes I proposed would make the game even less like retail, starting 1.7 itemization doesn't make the game easier.
---
&gt;They was to ignore the fact that shit like flasks are expensive because raids are tryharding for clear times
---
Everyone already knew that MC and Onyxia would be ran over.
---
&gt;Blizzard problem of the day is over populated servers.
---
Thats not an issue at all.
---
I obviously don't care.
---
People have decided the new big reason why classic isn't the glorious experience they hyped themselves up for it because of server population.  They have nonsense arguments to support it and are unhappy trying to accept that there is no way to get the original vanilla wow back.  The players have changed.  Everyone from private servers knew what was going to happen because the players approach the game differently.
---
Nope, people have to blame someone else.  These are the loud angry masses who say blizzard ruined the game by catering to the loud angry masses and wanted classic to go back to before the game was ruined by loud angry masses.
---
I've seen a few. Not everybody min-max / net talents. Especially on an RP server. We have one on our side who calls himself the "bonkmeister" He's a rogue who uses combat maces for the stuns and just loves to stunlock people, then again I'm on an RP server.
---
So the entire horde is stream sniping? If you make a horde on the server global chats are spammed with pvp invites to gank X streamer since it's easy honor (stream sheeps close by). Guess the entire faction streamsnipes.
---
Than Asmongold and Esfand also stream snipe since they also react to what people say in their chat...
---
r/unexpectedwaterboy
---
They would share a CD.
---
He gon get banned
---
Mage here.
---
I have the belt slot from the ogre in brd arena, it gives 1% to hit with spells.
---
 I also have the t1 belt which, in my case would complete the 5/8 bonus so targets are less able to resist spells. 
---
Which one will ultimately give me a higher likelihood of landing spells?
---
As others said it has nothing wrong with it. Retail made all of the improvements but we are playing a nostalgia game not retail here.
---
I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but any spell in the game has a 1% chance to miss right?
---
Do you have proof that Asmon is talking badly about another streamer and also sending his twitch chat into another streamers twitch chat to harass them?
---
I am agreeing with you.  These people are just being angry and need something to blame that isn't themselves.
---
14 years ago when we were raiding MC, one of our hunters gave his pet the same name as the GM of our rival guild had.
---
Every time the pet got targeted by a bomb the GM got like 30 whispers from DBM to get out of the raid.
---
Exactly this. This is why he's banned from twitch and not from WoW. You can gank or corpse camp someone in WoW, Blizzard doesn't care, you can't constantly harrass someone on twitch and make your entire community around how much you hate him and cultivate entire community of people dedicated to hating him.
---
&gt; Doing that on an alliance account is against wow's tos.
---
Sir, can I get a quote
---
Great counter point. 
---
Im on one of those servers ... I dont engage in that kind of behaviour.... You think its fine for me to be inconvenienced because you're being inconvenienced.... 
---
I think the irony is up there somewhere....
---
Rogue has no idea how to play his class is more like it.  I had no idea what he was going for.
---
yea, the only way it could be solved is faction transfers... but a lot of people would be against that
---
It's fine. The apostrophe is used for ellipses, and this is a construct called noun phrase ellipses.
---
When you say "a ten year old" what you're really saying is "a ten year old (person). That is the complete noun phrase, with the ellipses being the truncating of the implied noun.
---
So "10 year old's" would be "10 year old(person)s" where the apostrophe is replacing the removed letters just like with a contraction.
---
Wow imagine being corpse camped when ganking in an opposing faction’s capital city. Glad to see you’ve rectified this profane injustice
---
been trying to get into mc for the past 30 mins, the lag is insane
---
boomer
---
You'd also have to avoid ever reading any strategy guide, article, blog, or wiki about the game.
---
There is plenty of evidence my dude, if you ever bothered to watch his stream you would know that he always gets Asmon’s current location DMed even when  Asmon is not streaming.
---
A clout leech.
---
&gt; The AH cut is closer to 5% 
---
It's 5% in WoW too, for the faction-specific AHs.
---
I can second Ashkandi. I'm only a 43 Hunter, but I haven't had many issues finding groups, selling at the auction house etc, and quite often there's an Onyxia head in Org.
---
The problem is that you can get that 15% debuff without bringing a shadow priest. My guild has an assigned priest in each raid that is PI+shadow weaving, and just stacks the debuff then heals. I do think Shadow is fine, but you shouldn't focus too much on shadow weaving.
---
If you bring a stealth class with you, the torch room is made much easier if you let them scout ahead and Mark the targets.  Then you all are very well aligned with the direction you're going and not gonna be caught looking around and getting respawned on
---
He seems like a good hearted guy, with a pretty crappy personality. I dont wish him any ill will and respect his success. I just wouldnt hang out with him at a party.
---
He should switch to Mixer. That’ll keep him from getting banned.
---
Fuck you and your shit guild and your lame post.
---
Hahaha spot on! I was reading guides while preparing for classic after never playing on pservers. I was surprised how different my knowledge of vanilla was either just wrong or misleading.
---
Not really. Asmon talks a lot of shit but he never focuses on a single person for more than five minutes. Advertise has been shitting on Asmon on stream since September.
---
I actually forgot to blur out their name at the top of the graph.  
---
All hail Czanza!
---
Currently am 2h fury with OEB and sitting on 29% crit chance in fury spec and I can top the leaderboards depending on the fight. Sometimes you sit there hitting them like a wet noodle and others I see 1k-2k crits popping nearly every swing. Not sure how I did it, but I parsed 96 on rag once. It’s a good spec, but 1h fury is much better in raiding if you have some nice 1h’s.
---
Warriors lose basically every time 1v1 with a rogue.
---
Looks like he's doing a "transmog contest" aka grown men playing dress-up in a video game.
---
If there is a PvP solution,Blizzard will not step in,unless game mechanics are being exploited.i.e safespotting.
---
In your scenario a streamer is a protected class of people.Anyone could just start streaming to stop ganking.
---
Its absurd
---
It's amazing that you lack the ability to see how this discussion regarding you telling someone else to take their opinion elsewhere when this forum is exactly for that purpose of expressing their opinion on the subject of WoW Classic. Are you seriously that dense? At this point I can only assume you're trolling.
---
Thats talkin' shit in general, basic banter, not targeted harassment.
---
At 40 you’re in the 40-49 brackets.
---
Twitch has always been very selective about who is and isn’t breaking the rules so this really isn’t a surprise.
---
This. 100%
---
it ruffles the jimmies of anyone unlucky enough to have ended up on one of those servers.regardless of if they engage in 10:1 stomfests or not.
---
No it's not.  Cite a source if you think that's actually true.
---
Isn't heartseeker the glowing exception to this... as in it seems to be the only place where Allliance own the PvP whuppin' stick.
---
&gt; Easier yes. But not better as it will only accentuate the existing problem as people on the weaker faction leave the server, further increasing the faction imbalance. We have already seen this happen in the first round of server transfers Blizzard allowed which is why they have started doing faction based server transfers between PVP servers.
---
The problem i have is that the solution just shifts the problem from one person to another. Regardless of if they're the problem or not
---
Did he actually break any rules? I never go on twitch but I’ve seen some of his vids on YouTube &amp; he usually tells people not to harass/brigade asmon or his butt buddies. Like I said tho, I don’t get on twitch so I have no idea what his chat is like
---
Ah. Well maybe one day you will be able to express your opinion without resorting to name calling. 
---
Go on throwing out insults because I’m not treating your subreddit properly.
---
&gt; cant use flying mounts
---
i'd hope not
---
He isn't banned from WoW, just from twitch. Which, considering how much you hate streamers, you should be happy with.
---
The problem isn't that I don't care about dying to pvp. I play a warrior so we suck at pvp most of the time. But being camped into Oblivion is pretty fucking awful. I was averaging about a lvl/day now it's less than half over the course of a few days. 
---
Yes should I have gone on a PVE server from the start yea. But also enjoy small group pvp. But being camped till I just log off isn't fun.
---
Ganking someone in a game is harassment? That seems absurd unless he was doing out of game stuff to harass him.
---
&gt;Paid character transfers aren't available in classic.
---
They're not available right now, but they were available in Vanilla, and I'm sure they'll be available again.
---
This sounds like a shut-you-down, but I'm here to be serious: If you aren't having fun playing on pvp or you can't because you're always dead, reroll on a pve server. Why is this *not* a shit suggestion? Because it is going to take forever for blizzard to get the transfer you want into place. Maybe even longer than it will take for you to get to 60 on a new server. 
---
Is it ideal? No, it obviously costs you time. But if it's time that you can *play* instead of *be dead* or *frustrated to high heaven* then it's probably worth the time investment and quality of life upgrade. Your blood pressure will thank you.
---
Yh it's a shame. For the amount it costs for what it does it just kinda blows.
---
Thunder fury doesn't disappoint though, if only you could dual wield it.
---
Is Firemaw on the Burning Crusade already? Can't wait for it!
---
You do realize Advertise is a streamer as well?
---
This is what I don't understand when people say just re roll. It's the time invested
---
🙄 jesus
---
Just spann there boxes with shit
---
Asmon made himself a target by declaring him and his guild would and could rule the server.
---
Dont make such declarations if ya cant handle the pushback
---
Their platform that is based on players in games showing their screens.. bans people for screenwatching? Hilarious.
---
 You are categorically wrong with that assumption, and we already have proof as this is exactly what happened in vanilla when they opened paid transfers.
---
Lol, i mean u get stuck on the bats / gryphons for an hour or so.
---
You can have multiple ret pallies and clear all content easily.
---
Whoosh.
---
Of streamers? Yeah sure. Who wouldn't want to get paid to play wow? I enjoy streamers I'm just not a one note fanboy like you. You're mad I have negative things to say about the hero you worship. It's cute but you'll grow out of it.
---
50 mins and counting trying to enter MC
---
No they do not.  I cant tell you how many times I have died without being able to cast a single instant spell, not even one!  I have even had rouges sap me while on my epic mount.  I dismount, and get opened up on from behind all while I am spamming my instant cast Psychic Scream, and never get it off to have any chance of surviving the attack.
---
who is suppose to call out "Melees In / Melees Out" in ragnaros fight?
---
the tank right? because he is the one that knows when he has enough threat on rag after he casts WoR which resets everyone's threat?
---
He did nothing against WoW TOS.
---
Now he is free to stream snipe Asmon all day and make more Youtube videos about it.
---
I feel like it should be called a PvPs realm. 
---
Player vs Players
---
Inle?
---
Advertise is just a fucking leech, fuck him.
---
You can turn the quest in whenever 100%. The buff will only go out if the head isnt already dropped
---
edgemasters + CHT
---
Farm your weekly 100g so you can raiding and pvp. If you cant afford it dont do it :)
---
Was your Lock spec'd into Soul Link? Actually more impressive if they weren't.
---
Also talents have changed a lot
---
Actually on Alliance-Stalagg, nearly as bad as Skeram though
---
No, this pretty much was how it was. Even in classic pvp servers were mostly horde. There wasn't any less than 60% horde. Some as high as mid 80's. Trying to play as alliance on pvp servers in classic was just as much hell as it is now. 
---
This actually is the exact same as Vanilla, but with a retail attitude. It's not the game that changed, it's peoples mentality to playing.
---
Back then people just played. Now there is calculated honor farming, BiS dungeon farming, and optimal strats. The game didn't ruin classic. You guys did.
---
I guess I'm not concerned with min maxing as much as having a good 2H weapon for PVP and bring versatile. My concern is that we have *so many* fury warriors and rogues already. Thanks for the feedback! What weapon did you start with? Arcanite Reaper?
---
Definitely some solid points made.
---
I see what your saying as far as the differences, and we will have to agree to disagree.
---
I guess I'm approaching it from the angle of which class I would suggest to someone completely new to wow and PvP. 
---
Less abilities and such for rogues with a plethora of cc and an escape, versus complex and intricate totem usage based on situations you will have to also learn to identify.
---
Cheers man. If I can ask, any advice to come off less condescending? I'm a NYer so we tend to be very coarse / callous in our approach to dialogue lol
---
Imagine being this wound up.
---
Typical asmongold: "We run the server, we own every zone and we decide when the horde gets to play"
---
*Gets corpsecamped, ganked multiple times every single stream*
---
Asmon: "i cant play this game i am transfering to pve whenever i can"
---
The point is if you want to level up, just go dungeon grind in the "coffee shop across the street" for 2 weeks while you wait for your "toilet" to be fixed on December 10th.
---
I know what I said, I know your repeating me.   I know there’s servers out there that are very balanced.   I know people complain about the choices they made and cry to blizzard to fix.   I also know your dead wrong about the faction I play.   I also know people jump to conclusions and speculate without knowing the facts.       My friends and I waited to sub after release so we can research data on servers population and balance.    I’m surprised to know not many other did the  same.     Sucks to be them but then again it’s was all there own choice and inability to plan ahead.    And there’s no flying mounts to fly over people like me.     Hehe.    It’s good to be me because I play for fun and  not to complain about my own choices.    Attitude is a very small thing that makes the biggest difference.
---
I browse exclusively on mobile. When I am on a pc, I am playing the actual game, instead of reading about it. Just an example for you, as I am sure I am not the only one
---
Chatservers had 10-15 min delay for the past 3 days. They fixed it, but now the world server is down.
---
More layers please
---
No idea.  Herod is +60% horde too but it feels like alliance are more coordinated and frequently hold the advantage in a lot of cases.  They tend to control BRM 95% of the time, the other 5% being tuesday when all the horde guilds are going to raid.
---
Lol, those people who are griefing FPs aren't targeting a specific individual on Twitches platform, and probably are not streaming it. Point is that it took place in WOW but was broadcast on their platform. He didn't happen to randomly stumble across Asmon, he clearly went out of his way to do it.
---
this dude in a group with a guy named "Who" and a guy named "Tank"
---
Why feels bad? Dude spit and laughed and paid the price for his cockiness.
---
And in a 1v1? Really?
---
The claim that he streamsniped was addressed by him on how he gets information from other players in game. He might stream snipe but that would be an unfounded claim but at least he has evidence of another legitimate way he knows where Asmon is. 
---
To sum up, he is accused of streamsnipng, he provides evidence that suggest he doesn’t have to. Unless there is more claims against him, this one doesn’t hold.
---
They can be argued to be mounts, just not player controlled, and they are flying. Calm down funny guy.
---
It's a big part of knowledge too. I remember all the images needed 5 magisters to raid mc back in vanilla. We didnt understand spell power back then. We just didnt understand.
---
I use a 16 slot quiver and a 12 slot bag, plus I have arrows in my mail.
---
So, no I had no idea how I was coming off to ya. Just passing time at work talking smack about nothing important lol
---
I mean he made a 20+ min video about how he easily finds peoples location.
---
It's not hard to find the big streamers location just by asking World Chat or guildies etc.  
---
People also PM Asmon's location all the time.
---
Nope. They can get real jobs. Fuck 'em.
---
Only 800g with honored reputation and Rank 3 in PvP
---
make macros to always start an attack even if you dont have enough rage for said attack then you will at least auto it. Get sunder up on your main target and try to save taunt for when you drop aggro as it does nothing to a mob you have aggro on already. Its rough playing  tank at lower level but if your going full prot then rush for shield slam as it will help you keep aggro so much better. Another thing i would highly recommend is at least 3 points in Tactical Mastery so you can still execute if need  be. Iron Grenades can also be a great  way to buy time to control a  situation. People will tell you not to do this or that, and that you can use 2h as a tank in normal dungeons. This is only true if you have experience at the game as a warrior. Go mostly prot, ill link a build and please note that you get pierce  howl last as its amazing in pvp cc and takes the egde off lost pack aggro in a dungeon.

no u
---
The one between BRM and Burning Steppes is so shit. Major lag going over that even with only a few players nearby.
---
Hurray im special
---
/cry
---
&gt; Has this ever happened in the history of WoW live servers?
---
We see it at least weekly here. We've even gotten posts about all 3 legendaries in one raid.
---
Asmongold is exactly what he accuses other people of being. A "beta" **GATEKEEPER who also happens to be a sociopath, just like his officers.**
---
Learn what unfair business practices is Amazon/Twitch. Time for you to face a few lawsuits due to the incestuous relationship between moderation and streamer friends.
---
This is total karma too haha, someone named "You" made me panic lightly several times in a dungeon because I thought I need rolled stuff by accident whenever he needed something.
---
It seems to be just asshole alliance guilds trying to crash BRM on purpose just standing at the MC entrance doing aoe. Literally. They should be banned.
---
[Tank] you mean me?
---
[Who] i'm still waiting on third
---
[You] i never even spoke about tank
---
Sue what?
---
ahaghhaha, his whole content are breaking Twitch TOS and when they finally ban him he should "sue" lol.
---
I love how you tell someone on a discussion forum to go their opinions elsewhere, then I respond without ANY name calling for 2 responses and as soon as you realize you were in the wrong, you resort to acting like a victim of name calling. Grow a pair of balls.
---
I have had zero problems finding groups to do anything on pagle. Multiple guilds on horde ha e mc and ony on farm and plenty of people doing dungeons throughout the day.
---
I think some of the lower lvl dungeons like WC might not be done frequently but I don't think that's a big deal.
---
Capitalize names ye fokn wanker
---
Well, we gotta make a minotaur \*somehow\*,
---
.. and I can't bare children soooooo...
---
I saw someone type "mean't" the other day. As in "meant"
---
Weak... or massively outnumbered?  You lot are like locust. There's no such thing as a 1v1.
---
I thought for plural it would have to be " 10 year olds' " then iirc. But I don't see this case too often so I could be wrong anyway.
---
twitch was bad for classic
---
I laughed so hard I almost peed myself.
---
I'm going to see if Everyone is free on my server when I get home.
---
Iir at 19 you get WSG only and a very small amount of abilities.  This can get dull fast.  At 39 you have a lot of your abilities unlocked, also have AB to add some spice
---
What realm is this on?
---
Time your CC better (assuming the tank isn't an idiot and doesn't charge into the pack.)
---
Mining material, gear I can’t wear yet, things I don’t remember why I still have. You know. The essentials.
---
Go ele man, crazy good with some gear.
---
he 39 bracket is popular because it is right before many classes get their top tier talent in a tree.  This really hampers stuff like warriors/shadow priests which see a huge power spike.  There is no ice block or Arcane power.  No soul link or stormstrike.
---
Basically the brackets break down largely based on popularity of certain classes/spec.  Warriors kind of blow ass before 40, so anything below that is difficult for them and removes them from the bracket.  This gives a big advantage to classes that have issues with warriors.
---
Rogues are almost always popular, as are hunters.  39 Is the fist bracket with druids having travel form I believe, which makes them incredibly powerful.
---
The brackets are all weird mishmashes of their own metas and it's actually really fun to read about.  I never had the patience to do it, but it was always one of the most interesting parts of the game.
---
Pic or didn’t happen :)
---
Yup and I'd imagine he probably gets sniped as well.
---
There's a shadow priest in my raid group so ya know play what you wanna play.
---
Then with free transfers after a while there will be no alliance or the ones who are there will be ok with being ganked i guess?
---
I know my entire guild migrated in vanilla for that exact reason
---
so communication is king as a tank, tell your party what you need for you to tank, if you need them to hold back to establish threat make sure they know, if you want them to focus priority targets, you have to communicate/show it with markings
---
switching targets and hitting sunder to pool and establish a threat lead is super important, especially if you have heavy single target dps classes who rip adds from you frequently, get familliar with what each dps brings to the table to utilize them better  
---
tanking is rough while leveling, its even rougher with pugs, find dudes you can roll with, best way of dealing with tanxiety is to just tank dungeons until you are numb, early on one dungeon was enough to burn me out, now its easier to do back to back runs   
---
if you need any further help feel free to shoot me a pm, im not the best tank in the world but ive killed rag plenty of times, did both deep prot and fury prot tanking, ill gladly lend my knowledge where i can  
---
keep at it dude, it not going to be easy but when everything clicks its one hell of a feeling!
---
You’re a god
---
He didn't get banned on WoW, only twitch. I don't agree with them but Blizzard doesn't consider any amount of in-game ganking/griefing/corpse camping to be bannable.
---
As fury/prof it is definitely not worth to have more then 9% hit due to the “bug/feature” making off-hand not miss when Heroic Strike or Cleave is queued. Due to the amount of rage generated while DW-tanking you will not get much use of extra hit.
---
Well he had one of his guilds officers lead a raid to camp Advertise for like 5 hours straight on one of his streams.
---
This "targeted harassment" goes both ways but the big streamer doesn't get banned it seems like.
---
Sold it for 1000g
---
As should everyone. Asmon is a piece of shit masked in human skin. Remember when he had his friends reserve his name on all servers and cried on stream about not getting his name? Then started begging for subs to make himself feel better?
---
Faction queues are going to exist no matter what once battlegrounds release. Either people queue to get in the game or they queue to get into a match.
---
If the problem is an imbalance, then allowing the imbalance to grow is not shifting the problem. It is making the already existing problem worse.
---
1. It's Big
---
2. It's on Fire
---
3. It shoots Fire
---
4. It says "I clear raids. I'm Rich. I'm Lucky"
---
&gt;I'm fine with no wpvp if it means I get to fucking log on.
---
The answer for you then is to play on a normal server instead of PVP. That isn't a bad thing like some mouthbreathers on this subreddit seem to think it is.
---
all the top pvpers use weapon chain, death grips are very bad compared to other glove options and crusader enchant won't proc much in pvp with a slow 2 hander
---
Just because you can have multiple shadow priests, why? Why make content more difficult by bringing in a weaker DPS spec than somebody purpose built, like a rogue?
---
I say this as a priest that would love to be Shadow, but let's not kid ourselves 1x Shadow weaving (which can even be done while Holy) is good enough.
---
Yea. Crazy how I didn’t act like a victim of name calling until you name called. 
---
Almost as if I didn’t wait until I was in the wrong. Almost as if I waited until you insulted me before I played victim of name calling.
---
We haven't even gotten that far, we all got stuck on the flight master.
---
Wtf, could you scam people then transfer servers in early vanilla? People say it was enforced in vanilla.
---
Not to mention free server transfers increase risks. Are Blizzard taking the standpoint where "if you get scammed you shouldn't be doing business". You are dependant on other people's proffetions in this game, the game will strictly get worse if people become distrustful and paranoid fuck this.
---
You’ll get rolled. Gear &gt; skill in classic.
---
Yeah you're gonna get completely obliterated in small scale bg's since basically the entire 60 population is a raider this time around.
---
Great comeback.
---
My guild assings a meele dps and then the tank calls out if he resisted it or not.
---
That is maybe on the edge... But probably right... 😂
---
This is easily googleable. Look at guides on Icy Veins, Wowhead, etc. It will break it all down. This is also a question you could ask in a Simple Question Sunday or Classy Friday.
---
This is why it's time we talk about possible cases of harassment and bullying in PvP. Ganking, cross faction sniping, etc.
---
So I called you dense? Because you're clearly acting like a person who is dense. Sorry not sorry. If it hurts your feelings so much, take those feelings elsewhere just like you told OP.
---
0 reason to to above 9%. Get edgemasters and trim it down to 6%
---
My guild has 2 2h fury warriors and they both got OEB and now let others go for 2h too.
---
But we have 1) good communication 2) class meetings 3) respect for each other 4) dkp and prio sheets that are open for discussion / changes outside of raid time
---
Oh and we clear mc and ony in 2.5 hours with people in some pve specs and some pvp specs.
---
It really comes down to guild culture and if people are on the guild to have fun with each other or mute themselves in discord and try to compete and dick over others becuase they just want loot
---
That is already happening to the players that are on the weaker factions. Why do you think Blizzard is pushing up battlegrounds?
---
We do have great healers - but this was nuts. I (another lock in the guild) have had her face me from someone pulling threat and a swipe killed me. Czanza got super lucky on not getting crushed.
---
The way i see it, its more of a griefing than ganking, Advertises main content was centered around Asmongold and his guild. Even his youtube channel shows that.
---
He was just playing around, stunlocking until he got bored, then tried a quick kill with the death ray.
---
I thought they were unable to get into MC because of the lag, and then even more people go into BRM so the problem gets even worse. Whole guilds should just log out, wait 10 minutes and try again later..
---
This is disgusting &amp; why I roll horde
---
/r/cursedcomment
---
Transfers were not as available in vanilla. And if my memory is correct they were not as instant there was a little bit of a wait. 
---
And yes I think that is their stance.
---
&gt; While I don’t care about either one enough to look into it further, it seems like Advertise got popular solely from harassing Asmon. If that’s the case then I’m pretty sure that’s a reason to get banned. If that same situation happened with a popular female streamer the channel would be gone within hours.
---
&gt; Also as annoying as Asmon can be, Advertise’s voice is horrendous. When I first saw one of his videos I was like ok he’s doing a funny voice to add to the video...it works. Then it kept going on, and I saw another video and the voice was still like that. How anyone can listen to him for more than a few mins is beyond me.
---
I believe this would fall under harassing another twitch streamer, which is not allowed.
---
Well we can agree on this for sure: if you aren't shackling the ghost, kill the thing first :)
---
Yeah, that’s what I figured.
---
Not if they're fighting another twink. Even just getting stam enchants (which are really cheap) on all your gear, and 100 health on chest will put you out of one-shot range.
---
Cuz it’s your punishment for taking the res sickness
---
Please tell me you are only killing boars.
---
Ya lets just allow servers to become completely dead on one faction when BGs are literally right around the corner.
---
You got 60 in 2 weeks playing 4 hours a day? That's like 2 days /played, pretty impressive.
---
&gt; THIS. It's against TOS what Advertise was doing. His entire channel was dedicated to shitting on another partnered streamer. That's against TOS. It has nothing to do with the ganking. It's the cultivation of a hate community purely on one person. That is against the twitch TOS. His ban was 100% correct.
---
&gt; I know everyone shits on streamers here but you can't get past the facts. People are being purposefully misleading with the titles of these threads.
---
His name being Advertise is very confusing. Im sure a lot of people did a double take at the threat title lol.
---
&gt; (assuming the tank isn't an idiot and doesn't charge into the pack.)
---
Why would you prefer the tank to not generate a large amount of early rage? Thats the whole purpose of a 3rd party pulling the pack.
---
Here's a diagram: (X= Enemy, M= Mage, T= Tank)
---
X --sheep--&gt; M &lt;--Charge--T
---
Crit cap is not a relevant factor, its only on white hits and will only happen world buffed. If ur raid is world buffed and u crit cap u will be HSing every swing anyway so u wont have white hits. People wear over 9% because not every item drops for every player so there is frequently not a better, easy to get option than the good dps item that has hit on it and ppl are lazy, if u have more than 9% (6 with wskill) then u can drop hit to get more ap/crit if u have something to swap
---
Use the search function.
---
Vanilla is far from perfect, and to me the BGs are not fun at all. Yes without raiding you’re at a massive disadvantage. Yes without an epic mount you’re at a massive disadvantage. And even then, the BGs are not as organic and balanced as some might remember.
---
Private servers have evolved to a point where BGs are just finding out immediately which side controls the BG then letting them rofl you ASAP so you can queue again. Losing quickly is better than stalling a match that doesn’t have a timer. 
---
The people that farm for R14 typically don’t even get contested. When they join the BG the other team knows to let them get their quick win. It’s not fun, it’s stupid. BC PvP is less awful.
---
IMO if you want classic WoW PvP, either small scale wpvp (Which won’t be possible on most servers until BGs release) or twinking a low level bracket are your options
---
What I don't get though, is that there already exists a malleable version of the game that is able to change and evolve in all the ways the community wants. So if you want to shape the game into its best possible form (whatever you think that might be), why not work with clay rather than stone? Classic *is* a nostalgia piece. It's a slice of video game history, which is by nature intended to be relatively static. And if they did start taking classic in new directions, it's only a matter of time before they have to start dealing with people calling for vanilla again.
---
There is no equivalent to the Edgemaster's Handguards for 2h weapons. During this phase, the only way to get an increase to 2h swords or 2h maces is the OEB. Getting at least 5 weapon skill is really important, and points up to 8 are really valuable since they reduce glancing blows further.
---
I previously wasn't including the Band of Accuria or Don Julio's in the gear list. If I add those, however, and even use 9% hit with the OEB (with 3% wasted), the spreadsheet still shows OEB about 6 dps ahead of the BRE. I highly recommend playing with the spreadsheet to see if there is a way to gear around different weapon options, but overcoming a lack of weapon skill is not easy.

---
Since when is ganking someone without streamsniping is called harrassment ? Just curios whats the Definition is.
---
Your intellect is unmatched! Woe is me!
---
One thing to remember about the 39 bracket - warsong Gulch is won by whoever has the better druid flag carrier. That's it. It can get frustrating at times.
---
Maybe, but I'm not a "top PvPer" never will be. I don't play enough and am just not dedicated enough to put in the time needed.
---
Doubling down on name calling isnt exactly the best plan to go with.
---
"I say u dum cuz u dum"
---
It doesnt hurt my feelings. But when you resort to name calling in a discussion, it invalidates everything you say. Notice how the topic has now changed because of your name calling?
---
Yes, you are applying it but not the logic behind the idea.
---
Saying I am going to kill and camp all the horde, knowing there are streamers on the horde, and then comparing it to I am going to kill and camp this particular streamer creates the issue.  I understand why it is being applied as it is considered direct harassment, but the logic behind it is still awkward.
---
You can say it is directed harassment and that is how it will go down, but if killing Asmongold prevented the camping of all the horde, it isn't targeted harassment but instead a military tactic.  Killing military officers destroys an army's ability to fight properly.  Yes he is targeted, but that is because he made himself a target.
---
xD
---
&gt; There are people who straight up didn't understand how bad a PvP realm would be in their interests of leveling slowly and would prefer to level on PvE realms.
---
Then they should have rolled on a PVE server.
---
No, but by the end of Classic Warriors will literally kill you in one GCD. Even right now with a BRE they can chunk you down about 3k in one GCD, if they land a grenade or rocket helm there's a real chance they explode you.
---
There's always a 1% chance to miss on anything.
---
I dont know. I got killed 3 times by horde spamming aoe while trying to get the window portal to actually work, so pretty sure both factions are just trying to enter the damn raid. Everyone should get banned!! :)
---
Looks a bit too thicc for me
---
Not they're clearly griefing it on purpose not even trying to enter MC. They're just standing at the window and inside the NPC room spamming AOE.
---
Do not use stickies, it's not a phpbb forum.
---
Bro I don’t even like Asmongold I’m just not an idiot like you are being. You are CLEARLY the only one mad here  😂
---
Dont really trust the site for accuracy though.
---
Yup. I don't see a negative.
---
I'd also be okay with Race changes too.
---
However, to battle the whole "You can just ninja loot and change realms" I think name changes should be restricted unless a character has that name (obviously couldn't be a character you made prior to xfer ect)
---
Just think generic names, everyone, you, someone, everybody, tank, healer, dps, pull, you get the idea.
---
Let me clarify, I think we should implement a limited paid transfer where only the dominant faction can xfer off a server and go onto a server that isn't dominated by said faction.
---
I'll add that to the post.
---
Wrong, there are now zero layers. So the original statement is thus void.
---
Yes, that’s the EWT forums right? Already been patched. And I know of 2 other major ones entirely unaffected.
---
Go into any of their slacks and ask what to do when you get banned - everyone just rolls a new acct.
---
BG's are cross-realm.
---
&gt;I prefer the enviorment that our new 2019 culture and mindset has brought to an old game with no changes made to it.
---
But there has been changes made to it. The big ones are obviously the increased server cap, and the launch with layering. There are also other changes such as updated macros, guards on top of the neutral town roofs, obviously people are using modern addons which changes the game again.
---
So Blizzard has made changes, and all of them have been good, besides Layering lasted too long imo.
---
&gt;Changing stuff to fit the times defeats the purpose of the product.
---
I want the product to be as good as it can be, so I am perfectly okay with minor changes to compensate how the game is being played right now, because its not the same as it was in 2004-2006. So adding certain changes to compensate is imo usually a good thing, like breaking "game- ruining"addons.
---
Imagine your average joe schmoe gamer streaming his existence to 1000s of people 16 hrs a day. We'd all look like fucking lunatics eventually. Unfiltered entertainment is a mistake.
---
Not it's He
---
lol asmon had his number 1 gold seller unbind camp him for 5 hours and told him to do it on stream twitch is obviously favoring the guy who brings them in more money i hope he gets camped even harder so he actually quits classic because he brought the worst people to the game.
---
People have been bitching all week about how megaservers are fucking up the game.
---
Now the people wanting paid transfers are coming out who will only create even bigger megaservers.
---
These two groups need to discuss among themselves how to continue.
---
This is a huge exaggeration. Server still feels great, and I play horde.
---
Dammit this dude was smart and rolled PvE. Fuck.
---
So then you'd play on Classic, wouldn't you?
---
you have all your main spells and the gear/enchants available make the difference between twinks and ‘just passing through’ people huge.. so you can 1v2 and generally wreck things
---
Great solution.
---
&gt; However, to battle the whole "You can just ninja loot and change realms"
---
People already do this with free transfers.
---
Meh, just have one priest healer grab shadow weaving and stack it up at the beginning of the fight.  It's not a significant burden to keep applied.
---
It has changed because YOU put an emphasis on it. By name calling it doesn't invalidate anything, maybe to YOU. Everything you're saying is through your perception. But the fact of the matter is that you're telling OP to take his opinions elsewhere when this is exactly the place for him to post his opinions regarding Classic WoW. I'm not gonna keep going in a circle with you and your childish banter. If you don't understand how a forum works, maybe you shouldn't use it.
---
How do people watch this shit? What a waste of time. He's like the biggest loser in the entire world.
---
A lot of people see duels as represntations of "ideal" 1v1 PvP, and some see them as if you were out in the world.
---
Sometimes you might know they are there and you set up a freezing trap/flare, other times you might not and they would jump you. 
---
Considering he is your friend you should consider alternating your dueling style to who gets the jump/"ideal" conditions with trinkets etc according to what you want to test.
---
Thanks for the advice man! I really appreciate it. Will
---
Do :). 
---
I’m pretty new to WoW in general (not to MMO’s though), so this has all been a learning experience for me, but a very fun one at that. I’m looking forward to being a great tank, and melee DPS. I think it’s a calling for me over casters etc. These first 20 levels, even though much more difficult and grindy than mage, has been so much fun and I actually want to play on this character. By the time I stopped on my mage it started to feel like a chore or something (nothing against mages, I know they’re insanely fun to PvP with, and I’m sure I’ll ding 60 on mine eventually for that purpose).
---
You care you type essays
---
Ooh that chili recipe sounds just like the one I used to dig!
---
Hmm but I can't deal with heat like I used to. So I'll sub out the cayenne pepper for black pepper. And I only have garbanzo beans on-hand and I don't have time to go to the store and pick up the herbs that make this soup tasty. I'll do without them. And it can't simmer all freaking day, I've got a job and a family and obligations!
---
0/10 this chili sucks.
---
Who know?  I don't really even care what they do.  When they put a version out I don't want to play, I won't play that one.  See how simple that is?
---
Your solution is for players to quit the game, stop funding Classic and for classic to die?
---
That's not a good alternative.
---
But you also can't prove that he did. So the solution is to outright ban him? That doesnt seem fair at all.
---
Good point, the Spinal Reaper and the R14 two handed axe are excellent on an orc. I was just looking for a pre-raid option that was fairly good in a 2h. I didn't look that much into all the 2h options.
---
See my comment in reply to gvt87 for the comparison of the BRE to OEB on horde side. The BRE is still good and should go to someone. The player will often make a bigger difference than the weapon.
---
I have an entire runecloth bag full of ankhs, I refuse to be that guy
---
Oh right. Is it only lvl 63 that can crush?
---
Does shield block push crit off the table?
---
Thank you so much!
---
so it's a non issue then really
---
Economics 101: if you believe it's under-priced then why don't you buy it and sell it higher?
---
Thanks for your input. =)
---
Not the tank, he's busy enough.  Our raid has the RL do it, who is also a rogue.  Any melee dps should be fine though.
---
Wtf is this why the same toons seem to get punted over and over?
---
im in the same boat but in reverse order, got my 60 war, after getting all my gear goals on him im raid/guild logging and leveling a mage alt, got to lvl 29 and boy is spamming 1 spell mundane
---
wars are rough up to about lvl 40, then you get mortal strike you become walking death machine, and hopefully with friends to get the ww axe or enough fortitude to farm our the SM Armory gear everything becomes a breeze 
---
stick to it, also id get some gathering professions like herbalism and skinning worked really well for me to help pay for a few goodies and an epic mount down the road
---
dont be a stranger to farming an area for a little bit since it helps pad xp meters so you dont struggle, useful places are the dragon welps in badlands, bats in eastern plague lands, basilisks in STV, orks in AHL
---
going back to "green" level questing zones and casually questing there rather than struggling in yellow zones also make things nice and smooth
---
Lol warlock, mage and warrior can all beat rogues if played well
---
Okay. Enjoy your horde pve experience
---
The silent part of the population.  The vocal part of the sub isn't always the most experienced/knowledgeable
---
3 taps!!! Ugh the last day I’ve been getting crushed with two-pump chumps.
---
It's on them to know what they're doing and where they're doing it. If they don't want a pvp experience, new characters on pve servers are easy to make. No time machines needed and their screw-up is fixed.
---
I normally agree, but this is just fun
---
Is it really so weird though to dedicate yourself to killing and camping the guild leader of the biggest guild on the opposite faction? Keep in mind he isn't necessarily watching Asmon's stream to find him, he has another account in which he logs on and uses the /who function.
---
I think there are a lot of people who regret rolling on PvP server that would be willing to move regardless of the state of their server.
---
I play on Stalagg horde.  We have a horde advantage but that doesn't stop the Alliance gank raids and fights in most populated areas. I will regularly be trying to accomplish someone and just get ganked by a rolling death ball of Ally.
---
Now, i'm no stranger to PvP.  I played arena heavily in BC, never got to glad but made it to very high duelist at least every season.  I'm not amazing (not even close now-a-days), but the reason I bring this up is because I genuinely enjoy PvP.
---
But at the same time, its really fucking annoying that the "PvP" part of a PvP server right now very rarely means a fair fight.  I didn't realize how inconvenient and just down right annoying most of the PvP encounters I have are.  I would much rather just be able to run to my instance in peace, and PvP in BGs/Duels/flagged world fights.
---
Blizzard is the source...
---
wtf why is that bannable lol
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg)
---
Leveling my alliance alt on Mankrik though, LFG chat is (relatively) dead. There's like 1 message per minute, compared to 30+ messages per minute on horde side. Finding a group for anything other than Deadmines or SM takes a while.
---
Imo that's not a pug. A pug is randoms from trade/world. Not highly organized discord recruitment
---
My main goal is getting to raid and getting geared while doing so. I've never done a raid, and so I would pick the option that would get me there the fastest and easiest.
---
I'm not someone that has much time to play, so I'm still level 30 even when I started on release, but god I don't understand why are there level 60s running around and killing me... I won't give them honor, I can't fight back, what's the fun of it?
---
That poor paladin had to watch you kill each of his faction allies every time. I love it.
---
Okay that should be bannable. Not ganking asmon
---
While you’re right that it’s OP fault for not joining his friends server. But let’s see another possible scenario:
---
I have 2 groups of friends playing WoW, they’re totally unreleated and they don’t know each other. Group 1 rolls on server A and group 2 on server B. I choose to roll on server A. For whatever reason, group 1 stops playing. I’m now left alone on server A and can’t play with my friends on server B. 
---
Of course I could reroll, but I’ve already put over 200 hours in this character. I’m a dad of two myself and I don’t have to time nor the willingness of redoing the exact same content. At this point, I’d just cancel my sub. 
---
Blizzard loses a customer and that’s why I’m 99.9% confident we will have paid transfers in the future. Simply because as time goes, the above situation will happen to more and more players.
---
Lol thats ridiculous, onslaught girdle off should go warriors as well as quickstrike ring and strikers mark. Other than that everything else goes tanks, band of accuria included. Dropped last night and I passed to our MT lol
---
What’s that?
---
So you insult me and then use my same logic to tell me to go away? How does that make any sense? :)
---
Yeah no one pays me to play WoW. I work a real job 40 hrs a week still get corpse camped when I play in my free time. Fuck em
---
You don't think strategy guides, articles, and blogs about the most popular and profitable AAA MMORPG on earth were "a big thing"?
---
Does shadow resist aura stack with shadow protection (priest buff)?
---
It doesn't appear to on the character stats.
---
If I remember correctly, there are also only 3 times during the cast that you can get a bite, its (guesstimate) at like 24 sec left, 11 sec left, and 5 sec left or something.
---
Ahh that’s smart, I have been up that way looking  (and failing) to find black lotus’. 
---
I’m sorry about my initial question, reddit mobile doesn’t think ‘nerfed’ is a word. My initial quest was ‘I thought DM farms were nerfed massively’.
---
I tried AOE farming there and got literal trash, made hardly any gold so gave up
---
I don't know if you're being sarcastic but it's true most people would be playing like they did 15 years ago because they're casuals coming back for a taste of nostalgia and don't care to min max, but thanks for clarifying my point.
---
What?  I dont even know what that is.
---
As someone who grew up on Emerald Dream (RP-PvP), I love this type of realm. RP-PvP realms are super underrated.
---
Giving it to MT raises the threat cap and all DPS can go harder. It's the right move when you look at the big picture.
---
ya see. we have our melee dps class leader do it but he is wrong sometimes because the tank doesnt have enough aggro after WoR gets used.
---
I've made some edits because I wasn't transparent in what I was saying.
---
I believe Blizzard should be upfront about the faction balance ratios. Allow players to only xfer off a server if their faction is the dominating force and only allow incoming transfers to the server if they're the underwhelming faction.
---
The problem wouldn't shift it around to new servers because if Blizzard can maintain these rules no server should be too overpopulated by one faction ever again.
---
Blizzard has not given concrete numbers for either vanilla server population or what size the increases to server population in classic have been.
---
I didn't see that and I'm not a fan of Asmon, but I'm pretty sure he is making an act most of the time. It's entertainment and he knows it. As well as begging for subs seems to be in-character for him, I always saw that as part of a joke.
---
You have a higher chance of getting into a raid as a warlock, but easier to gear as a druid (healer spec for raiding).
---
Warlock is Tier 1 leveling
---
Druid is Tier 2 (honestly I would consider it tier 1).
---
The whole Taliesin thing? The dude spent multiple streams talking about it for like the whole stream, when all he had to do was say, "I didn't know he felt that way and I won't show his vids on my channel anymore."
---
But he went on a large smear campaign against him for several days.
---
Just remove world buffs completely from raids.  It's so completely ridiculous the difference in power level that it never appeared again in the history of the game.
---
Can't wait for the Pilav video about this.
---
Thank you for taking interest in my interest.
---
How did they know that?
---
I just assume anyone who posts Asmongold shit is a shill on his payroll.
---
Maybe Asmon should reroll on a pve server. Or get better bodyguards.
---
I'm really surprised there aren't a lot more people banned for this on twitch for this same reason...
---
I'm mocking your logic obviously.
---
Reddit is the best place to find dunning kruegers
---
Oh ok, you got me good.
---
Just wait for Dec 10th, Youtube will be following the same model.
---
Someone apparently did this as Versace back in vanilla Emerald Dream. I think they'd just sell shirts "Made by Versace"
---
From what I've seen in trade chat, I'd definitely get at least:
---
- Haste to gloves
---
- Stats to chest
---
- Speed to boots
---
- Herbalism to gloves
---
- Mining to gloves
---
- Enchanted Leather
---
- Maybe Enchanted Thorium
---
ya what a waste of time, now don't mind me while I go ride around my virtual skeleton horse for hours and mine video game ore
---
You know, its funny, i played vanilla and then pservers from 2011 onward and decided to start completely fresh with new people in Classic.
---
Coming from someone who played in a pretty hardcore guild, im suprised to actually see how much more difficult things are with people that havent been clearing MC for 5+ years.
---
Blizzard really doesn't seem to give a shit about balancing factions, so why not?
---
Bro that last Pooh had me fucking crying.
---
Dkp bids last sunday was intressant.. we did roll cause that was the onlything we found out to be instant..
---
Anyone else found themselves in here? I'm FatherKush and I can see myself chilling on the right with benediction.
---
That's a perfect analogy. Every 2 weeks a priest in your guild gets a great healing and dps weapon that only priests can use. Obviously you should gear up every other caster dps/heals with weapons over priests. Because they have a 50% drop rate to get a perfectly serviceable 2 for 1 weapon.
---
Theyve commented on max capacity of the servers. Also it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out largest servers like illidan had 20 guilds max at naxx and then now we have servers with over 100
---
Start streaming then see how you do LOL
---
Nah, you're underestimating how many casuals are playing. It went from 1% to 20%, rather.
---
Another trick I do on my shaman is make sure Earthbind totem is actually macro'd with */use Strong Anti-venom* first. Nothing will happen if you're not poisoned and you drop and earthbind, and it doesn't interrupt GCD so it's free usage if you are indeed poisoned and drop an earthbind.
---
Many, many times a rogue had jumped me and I was able to slam an Earthbind down and cleans his slowing poison at the same time to get away until he sprints... at which point I net. 
---
This won't help vs blinds or a good stunlock, but it's a great macro to have because it's free and venom sacs are cheap as hell.
---
&gt;so he investigated himself and found that he is not guilty, case closed
---
You really are missing my point. I'm talking about targeted harassment 24/7 while streaming, not just one or two ganks
---
I think it's about the intent and dedication. You can rant about a single person on your stream (with limits) but if the whole purpose of your channel is to harass one person there might be a problem.
---
Save these titles for YouTube, bromigo
---
I started with the dreadforge retaliator as it dropped while I had been leveling in BRD. I threw crusader on it as I didn’t think it would be replaced soon after and boom, OEB dropped 2 days after I hit 60 and I won the roll. 
---
IMO arcanite reaper is way too expensive. With the cost of arcanite bars being nearly 50g a pop on my server, that makes it 1k if you were to outright buy it. 
---
Go DM north and get the barbarous blade from king gordok if you are wanting to start with 2h as it has 1% crit and 60 AP along with a 24% chance to drop. 
---
MC a few of the bosses drop OEB so seeing one or two each month is pretty common. 
---
Rag loot also drops the spinal reaper and bone reavers edge, if one of these drops you will either have to roll on it between all the 1h fury warriors, or you will be master looted it because you are 2h fury raiding, but your current dps and pvp tank will probably be taken into account. Depends on the guild really.
---
Warlocks get their buff before mages in p4, where they can finally hit cap.
---
Poor planning on Blizzard's part*
---
Or maybe people who got fucked by Asmon’s raids called for help. PvP on a PvP server or whatever it people are always on about
---
... THIRD BASE!
---
It makes sense to punish stream sniping. It's obviously not the streamers fault that he's getting harassed. Do you also tell people who get robbed "You shouldn't have carried money with you"?
---
And while, when choosing streaming as a profession, one should know it comes with that risk; that still doesn't make it okay. Like, would you tell waitresses who get sexually harassed or even assaulted "Shouldn't be a waitress, it's your own fault, just get a different job"? Of course not. People do this work because there is a demand for it, they need to pay their bills, and some of them even enjoy it.
---
The streamers are putting themselves out there, but that's not an invitation to be an asshole to them. Guilt is 100% with the perpetrator.
---
Sorta? Asmon is the guild leader of the biggest guild on Alliance side, it isn't so strange to want to camp that player.
---
You could call any of the old stories of Classic obsessive to be honest, from camping the docks with a Rogue and killing lowbies to getting Grand Marshal/High Warlord.
---
They get one third of a vote! How is that a problem?!
---
I agree burnout is a factor, and I've talked with the dude and understand why he would want to do that. The argument I am going to make (opinion, no evidence) is that a majority of people who are doing MC (and will try BWL) are not tryhards. A majority of these people are not pre-raid BIS and rocking house. These people still wipe on MC Bosses or Ony. The problem with all of this is that their boss attempts and kills are going to be harder than they need to be by bringing "meme specs." Yes 5 bodies at low DPS is better than running five people short, but I can't see a good reason an honest guild would only ever hold forty people on their raid roster, with no spares.
---
14 days data on  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=14&amp;realm=4731\_Earthfury](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=14&amp;realm=4731_Earthfury)  shows a perfect 50-50 balance.
---
I'm on this server and it feels balanced.
---
I partially agree with this. The time for all of this was week one. Now that people and server economies are already established it would cause more problems than good. Blizz should’ve had the faction numbers when we were only allowed to make 3 characters. I have 7 alts on my main faction. I don’t play any of them but I have the characters. Those would contribute to an incorrect tally of my factions number. The only solution right now is to bite the bullet and reroll a new character on a new server
---
Raids will be ele/enhance but PvP you will probably want enhance 31 resto 20
---
Horde myzrael is great too
---
There's a list here, it's the most complete one that I'm aware of.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/wiki/classic-realm-discords
---
Experience converting to gold was not a thing at original launch, this likely provided a large injection of gold to a fresh 60, a few hundred at least, that plus general knowledge of what good investments are, high demand items and more variety of farming spots
---
You're comparing doing that, to watching someone do that.
---
Cry is free
---
I remember raiding was considered very hard and only the top few guilds on the server did it. There was no such thing as a pug mc run.
---
Resto is for raiding
---
Ele is for pvp
---
Enhance is for leveling 
---
But,..... I like the 0/30/21 build
---
Storm strike isn’t really that good, you’re better off going into resto for the hit % and Nature’s Swiftness.
---
Quit
---
&gt; What about other communities though!
---
my eyes just rolled outta my head
---
downvoted because mealy mouthed nerd who tries to pretend they aren't emotionally effected by downvotes by lashing out
---
I wish this were the case for my guildies. We know what times raids are, we know what time we’re grouping, and we know we’re pulling 30 minutes later. Even so, at least 10 people need a summon cause they’re off in BFE screwing around.
---
Reading. comprehension. literally read the last sentence
---
Level alts up until Redridge or Wetlands, you mean.
---
For the record, it’s a 7-day suspension and not a permaban.
---
Wait for Blizzard to introduce faction transfers \#changes
---
and for them to stop fucking with the census so people can see if they are on dogshit servers or not. The best way would be for them to advertise the faction ratio themselves just like pservers does.
---
Rolling a walking target?
---
My server is PVP and not unplayable.
---
PVE is for casuals, always has been, always will be.
---
The only people abandoning the game and servers are also casuals.
---
I dont really think I'll miss any of the casuals. Its hardcore players I'm worried about but all the hardcore players I know have found ways around the imbalance and got creative about it.
---
There are a group of Alliance raid teams on my server who always group together to travel to MC and they go through Loch Modan to avoid getting fucked at the flight paths.
---
They learned a way to handle their situation and enjoy the experience of innovating their gameplay to make shit happen.
---
Let the casuals leave or reroll or transfer. Nobody gives a damn about them anyways but Blizzard and I certainly dont unless I start getting a share of their sub money.
---
We need horde on myzrael, not an easy server but there is a lot of eastern time zone here
---
So you answered the first couple of words in my comment, what about the fact he feeds off of hate and harassment for content and viewership? Ignoring stream sniping completely this guy should still be banned
---
I don’t think he’s defending advertise. seems like the comment was just about how there’s a double standard since what asmon was doing was clearly targeted harassment as well, but hey received no punishment.
---
How effect is the gnomish death ray and what’s a typical situation it should be used ?
---
Unless the queues are very short, premades will have the group leader sitting close to the battlemaster only while the rest of the group will be roaming/killing around. They will take turns for the re-queue duty ofc.
---
Lol that’s cheap what server is this?
---
Thanks so much man!!
---
I read something to that effect somewhere just before classic. I think there's 5 and I don't think it's a specific moment, I think they have specific periods they can happen, since it still tends to be somewhat random. I have never cast and had it bob the same second, for instance, but as soon as 1 second passed I have. I've also had them bob with 1 second to spare.
---
He was raiding looking for another mount when I was browsing twitch streamers.  It's funny, you have Asmongold, WoW's biggest troll, who has NO clue about PvP and possibly vanilla WoW come over to the Classic servers and all he does now is bitch and complain.
---
You set the table son, now you have to sit at it.
---
That was just one example.
---
I mean he has personally insulted Advertise on multiple occasions.
---
He came into discord while Advertise was streaming and basically accused him of stream sniping with no evidence. 
---
Advertise was also camped by that officer and Olympus on other occasions as well.  I think the next day they camped him for another 2-3 hours.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
I dont understand how anyone could not recognize theres an issue here. All the Horde PVPers are miserable on Stalagg too. I know its not the same level of frustration as getting camped everywhere you go but we are super unhappy with the situation too. I've never seen or heard an actual good PVPer on my server say they are happy with the imbalance. /endrant
---
We postponed as well, and many others i think.
---
World PvP was fine pre-Phase 2. 60s generally ignored me. Most of my PvP encounters (5-6 per hour) were against other leveling players. Those sparse PvP encounters is what people enjoy.
---
The moment honor was introduced, the game became unplayable. Suddenly, I'm getting ganked by 5+ 60s within 2 minutes of rezzing. Every time. Monday, I played for 3 hours, completing only 2 quests and being dead about 75% of the time.
---
I always thought the #nochanges crowd was filled with idiots. If this had happened in Vanilla, Blizzard would have changed the honor system completely, or at the very least nerfed the honor provided for killing level 48-57 players.
---
3 weeks ago, my group of IRL friends consisted of 3x 60s, 2x 50s and 3x 40s on the Alliance side. Now, only one 60 logs in more than once a week. Everyone else has stopped playing.
---
I got 225 first aid at level 2, might do engineering too just to make it even more OP!
---
Thank you!
---
Step 1) filter out any character under level... 10
---
Step 2) filter out which characters have not had activity within a month
---
Step 3) find total unique accounts for the now filtered accounts.
---
I'm trying to get the dual Bonescrapper + Mugglers belt (+1hit +5daggers) as my preraid BIS, looks like an affordable set.
---
I don't get how people aren't grasping how much time is sinked into a single character. 
---
I've got a buddy who has over 50 days /played time in a character sitting and rotting on a dead server atm.
---
Moo button is best button.
---
The attention to detail is great. I thought it was poor editing but it's actually drool coming from third poohs mouth.
---
Chances are they play retail, box there as well, and pay for the subs with gold. All MMOs that open up the option to pay for subs with in game currency see tons of boxing and botting as a result. 
---
The ultimate goal? Usually to troll people in WPvP. As others have mentioned some hardcore PvE players pick it up once they realize raid content is essentially mindless and they try to spice things up. Surprise, though, it doesnt work. Who would have guessed doing a boring thing 40 times is just as boring as doing it once?
---
wasnt there a quest that had to be done in arathi  highlands for 1staid?
---
*insert alliance hunter joke here*
---
How's it goin fellow Incendian .. Incendiite.. no, Incendinese
---
MC, Onyxia, BWL will be puggable completely.
---
AQ20 and ZG will be easy pugs too.
---
AQ40 and Naxx will likely smash most pugs into the dirt on the more difficult bosses, but you may find the occasional pug can get a full clear.
---
Naxx will by far be the hardest one to complete with a pug.
---
This is the correct answer. Perditions and CHT 100% to any/all dagger rogues, then tanks, then after that anyone else who is just memeing.
---
You mean,
---
&gt;With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing. We expect this to result in smaller queues for realms that have large queues, and some realms should no longer have queues at all.
---
?
---
Again, they don't give any actual numbers, just said "substantially".  This could mean so many different things.  And as I've linked in the OP, the observations we can make RE: concurrent population seem closer to a 2x rather than a 5-10x increase (at least after layering was removed).
---
Can you tell me which add-ons you used for your interface? I really dig it and would love to recreate it!
---
No surprise, my rerolled Horde main would be 60 by now and healing the guild to get gear but I've basically been forced into corpserunning my way into ST/BRD and its killed my mood.
---
&gt;mount like half a year earlier than I did back in 2005.
---
Well played, take your upvote

I expected a one shot windfury that never gets old

This should be the basis of any subreddit.

The members of the community should decide and mods should only be there for extreme cases.

Can confirm. Killed Princess, wiped, she didn't respawn.

You should get help bro, being this obsessed means you're not right in the head

Sucks to be you.

Lol.   Pvp soldier.      I never mentioned my faction because I was curious how many turds would assume I was horde.    It was every last one that replied that speculated I was.    Like I said before.  I know your wrong.    Why would anyone roll PVE when pvp gives you so much more and by far more challenging which is more rewarding.   Don’t hate the player hate the game because the game is working as intended.
---
our MT is called, "not\*\*\*\*\*\*\*" which our raid leader has shortened to "not", as well as having three people in the guild called lucy, and 3 people called mike....organizing anything is a mess
---
You can’t check his twitch anymore obviously but if you look as his YouTube every one of his videos is mentioning Asmon, Olympus, or Esfand...but mostly Asmon and Olympus.  His first video is How to gank Asmongold and he has #asmongankers in a few others.  While it’s fine if he wants to do that, on Twitch it appears to fall under harassmen.
---
Well look at Mr. Science!
---
we finally got everyone in after 1.5 hour
---
What is the worst class you can pick if you want to pvp, because I surely want to play that class. I kinda suck and I'm a total casual. Also... what do you think is the most friendly faction? 
---
I was told that the alliance is better l, regarding helping low lvls and so, but idk... played horde since launch day and it was kinda cool. There's always a dude willing to help.
---
You get Ice block at 30, you probably meant Ice Barrier.
---
As an ele shaman I think OP just kinda panicked. He quite a bit wrong.
---
I was a brand new and extremely casual / uninformed player in vanilla, and one of the first addons I got was... Spy. or whatever the several combat log parsing enemy detection addons were called back then (Paranoia was one I think).
---
Spy is nothing new. Currently it's limited to 50 yards, well below visual range. If it were to disappear completely, the same roving groups would still patrol the same routes and find you
---
I think he's saying that the talisman is what broke into the bindings, and it was an item that has dropped. Which from your statement you seem not to know either.
---
Wait, so you mean to tell me I could just *choose* to make 2000x more money the whole time?? Hot damn! Quitting my job today!
---
60:40 is pretty unnoticeable. There are rumours some are as bad as 80-20 (heartseeker Ally dominant) but I don’t think we’re going to get accurate census tracking anytime soon. I play Kirtonos alliance which is supposedly one of the top 5 for imbalance toward Horde and very seldom lay would I call it “unplayable stacked but I’m also a geared 60. I think even for the horde on the server leveling from 52 it would reach unplayable but that’s p2 for you
---
I could see Horde and Ally Ganking at the AV &amp; WSG portals while people try to queue up for BGs.
---
Alright, that's fine, give him a ban.... but Asmon and his crew do shit like this ALL the time.
---
This door gotta swing both ways.
---
Because some people are actually having fun.
---
Imagine you are getting freezed at naxx and people trying to hide behind your back.
---
You would be correct
---
Salt is flowing early today. Grabbing my popcorn.
---
Ask mage to Target, warrior shoots skull, mage sheeps, perfection.
---
It's so good to level an alt. You have money for bandages and good food. Maybe a twink item or two.
---
Plus, for people that only started playing on classic release, they now know how to quest much better.
---
Raiding in general. I remember so many beast spec hunters and demon locks. Full prot warriors. People in trade chat and guild chat would argue all the time that the websites like thottbot or elitestjerks were wrong or that it didn't matter and any spec was viable. People used to refuse to use addons. They were the ones standing uncomfortably close on ony and getting double fireballed. It really was the wild west. Oh and people used to think you needed a full T.5 set before going to MC. Only hardcore players min/maxed their stats like we see in today's BiS gear lists.
---
Loads of people like TBC.  You need to actually learn to read, and go read the part where I said you could keep playing Classic while others play TBC.
---
Do you really think everyone is just going to keep playing Classic forever and ever and ever and never get bored with it?  Some people will quit.  Why do you care if those same people that would have quit go on to a TBC server?
---
I have to admit I do enjoy it.   Just makes me want to pvp more.
---
Totally man, needs more Drowning Pool
---
It's kind of like self defense. It's not legal for someone to hurt or kill you, and it's not legal for you to do the same, but it is legal for you to prevent them from trying to kill you by any means necessary. He cant play the game if he's just going to let others snipe and camp him.
---
Well, not like he plays the game anyway since he has his cult powerlevel his characters to 60 and then give him every single piece if tier in raids then says theres nothing yo do in the game.
---
You are right, the median player is actually worse than ever. The two biggest areas this is noticeable are healers + mages.
---
There is a guy on youtube who does same amazing things utilizing everything the class has as enh. But he mostly just stuck to using a dagger and shield
---
They're commenting on the double standard my dude.
---
This is literally how pulling has worked for years.
---
Mages used to sheep pull, or a rogue would sap pull.
---
Guys, if you come across a tank such as the OP. Kick her and find someone without their head stuck up their arse.
---
Use heroic strike
---
A dream setup?
---
Warrior with MH Thrash Blade, OH Flurry Axe, double crusader, windfury on MH, Hand of Justice, Sword Specialization.
---
What else am I missing?
---
I'd have to see your log to comment on the fight, but Ony isn't exactly the best fight to compare dps on since there are many factors that can affect dps on that fight. As for damage abilities, melee damage should never really be that high, if it is, you aren't using heroic strike enough to dump rage. I'm not sure about the AP ration you mentioned, but that seems off to me, at least for Alliance w/o Windfury totem. Lastly, if he's doing 20% more damage than you and the only difference is he's using Viskag/ Brute and DOESN'T have Edgemasters, then the issue isn't his weapons but a playstyle/ skill difference.
---
Are you on one of the insanely imbalanced servers where you have to run around and look for alliance forever until you find a couple ?
---
Windseeke is the best if you want to see the other faction around.  Afaik it's the only pve server with healthy alliance and horde populations.  If you want the max number of people to play with it would have to be one of the one sided servers like mankrik or ashkandi.
---
If you're a fan of wpvp though, without griefing, Windseeker is the only option bc it has ample opportunities due to the healthy ratio.
---
&gt;This is literally how pulling has worked for years.
---
This is not true.
---
&gt;  or a rogue would sap pull.
---
And this is evidence that you do not know how pulling works.
---
Not even remotely true, Asmon didn't start his stream by attacking then popular streamers. He didn't start his stream by going "fuck Soda, let's go attack Soda 24/7".
---
It scales based off your HP, so it's still very effective on level 60's.
---
It's best use imo is in any situation where you cannot hit the opponent with your normal kit. 
---
For instance, if you are a mage and silenced then the death ray is an amazing little tool for dealing 1-2k~ bonus damage where no one expects you to be able to do anything.
---
If you are a hunter and someone is in your dead zone, they wont expect a death ray.
---
Warriors that are frost novad/slowed while waiting for intercept CD can use it to great effect.
---
Use T2 head, Dal rends, stop using ns gloves and use devilsaur instead.
---
Alternatively use 6pc shadowcraft with T2 head and ns chest.
---
Nope, it's a disorient.
---
Damn who shit in your cereal this morning?
---
Is there any way to port to the front of the instance and reset it by yourself? Thinking it will help when I get to DME runs.
---
“runs” are when you do a dungeon but only clear it for a specific purpose instead of clearing the whole thing.
---
Jump runs are in DM East. As soon as you walk into the instance, you can jump down off the edge and bypass part of the instance. 
---
Rend runs are done in UBRS (i think) and typically paired with jed runs which is a rare boss spawn but drops good loot.
---
Tribute runs are done in DM North. Typically solo’d by a hunter that abuses pet mechanics and feign death to bypass packs to reach the end of the instance. At the end, if you bypass all the bosses on the way there, you’ll get access to a new loot table via a chest.
---
Lastly, Emperor runs are done in BRD, I believe its one of the last bosses, although i’m not too familiar with it. Most commonly you’ll find people looking for lava runs or arena runs in brd.
---
At equal lvl, there is a 4% chance to miss spells.  You can reduce 3% with gear/talents, but there is always 1% you cannot remove no matter what.  Which makes the hit% cap for PVP 3%.
---
Enhance is trash in raids without Nightfall axe
---
Jump runs - jumping down at start of Dire Maul East and killing the stuff on the bottom. Faster run that skips the imp for key.
---
Rend runs - first half of UBRS stopping at Rend. Doesn’t kill The Beast or Drakkisath
---
Tribute runs - Dire Mail North run focused on not killing any bosses except King typically. This means the chest at the end will drop unique loot.
---
Emperor run - BRD run that goes to end end kills Emperor. Some will kill Princess, others will save her for quest. These runs are not focused on quests and will typically skip things like jail and coffers.
---
I thought it was honey...
---
Yeah, you got me there lol. It’s not too bad for them to make money. For me, making gold isn’t hard just mind numbing. Kinda makes me wish we could farm strat live at retail speeds
---
The players most affected by this are still leveling because they can't play more than a few hours a week. In fact, if you're 50+ right now, you probably spent about 12 hours a week playing Classic since release. While it's not an insane amount of time, it's still more than what would be classified as casual.
---
Those players play on average 2 hours a night. Spending 30+ minutes forming a group and corpse running to BRD leaves you with barely enough time to do a single BRD, if that. You can be pretty damn sure those players are quickly losing patience and uninstalling Classic.
---
Phase 2 is single-handedly killing Classic and might even kill any hope of TBC or LK expansions.
---
You’re reaching.
---
Why an axe in OH instead of sword?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK9zHWKtabc&amp;t=879s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK9zHWKtabc&amp;t=879s) get good
---
The problem is that you're disoriented so you can't use any items (At least as far as I can tell), the only way to break it is things that can be used while disoriented and that's limited to things like Stone Form or Ice Block.
---
&gt;Also does it share a CD with normal hp potions?
---
I'm not too sure, I got a few on my druid and can check later.
---
Blind is a poison so it would normally remove it, but you can't use it while blinded.
---
My opinion is that even if people carry over a mass amount of items with their transfers as you say they would it would only hit the economy for a small period of time then would even back out to what the economy was before.
---
Its like when someone buys out the entire AH for Arcane crystals because they wanna craft HoR /Lionheart...etc. Yeah the price spikes up for about a week but then a new supply restocks the AH and people start selling at norm again, so in the case of transfers people could tank the price of Crystals for a bit but the thing is if they tank the price too fast they get bought out fast and the supply goes back to what it once was.
---
When they smushed him down his face grew out!
---
Can you show the details or link to them? Otherwise this is a completely pointless post with 0 context. Without going into details, after what I saw last night, I have no idea WHY he was suspended.
---
Ah, I forgot about macros - never used one.
---
I will look into that - thank you!
---
True, good chat man
---
Cheers
---
The crazy part is that they think they'll reach R10 or R13 that way. 90% of the players ganking relentlessly are still not going to get past R7-8.
---
No im not, you were making it sound like his job wasnt real or difficult to obtain
---
How are some people better at chess than others?
---
How are some people better at cooking than others?

How are some people better at swimming than others?

Want me to go on?
---
How many times a week is this question posted?
---
WTF is "encouraging faction balance" supposed to mean?
---
I beat down most shadowpriests I see (UD) and if I have all my cooldowns they just can't move until their dead. I haven't fought any 1v1 phase 2 tho so I imagine that's about to change with the trinket. still tho not being able to fear seems like it makes priests life very difficult
---
I didn’t learn first aid until 60 lol. As a shaman I felt like I never needed it, but then realized any advantage for raiding is worthwhile.
---
As someone from Earthfury, I agree there is a major problem stemming from the massive influx of transfers we just got. However, I don't think it is primarily because of population imbalance.
---
The issue that I have been seeing is that all the guilds we got were fully geared raid guilds; almost all of these people are done until BWL outside of pvping. Comparing this to the horde, we just don't have enough people who are A) geared enough to compete with the full BiS people I see daily now, and B) are actively throwing themselves into pvp. We probably are 55 / 45 alliance skew atm, but because of these factors, it might as well be 30 / 70 because comparatively we have so fewer active pvpers able to compete.
---
You can snag another tarnished elven ring for cheap or run DMN tribute as well. These are not unique.
---
We have a rogue in our guild called You and its fucking annoying.
---
I don't PvP, he's just for my entertainment.
---
Proof? He has a video up of every time he’s killed him so far, as well as Esfand, and how he gets information from other people. That, by definition, is not stream sniping. Also to bring up harassment lmao. Asmongold built his entire fan base by harassing and poking fun at the unwilling.
---
Rogue pvp question: when going against players with pets/minions(i.e. warlock, hunter, etc etc), do you stun the player and then kill their pet/minions first then go after the player?
---
You can do this with the addon Clique.
---
Out here grindin the hk’s. Not having shadowmeld for wpvp is both great and awful but I am enjoying it. Sup over there?
---
Garbage for anything but resistance fights where its like pretty good.
---
Without dual spec, I tweak a single spec to do all that I do, Or I farm tons of cash to do certain things better.
---
With dual spec, I tweak 1 spec for whatever is most important to me, (PvP, Raid, gold farm, etc) and another spec to use the rest of the time.  Hybrid druid goes from Ok Tank and ok heals, to damn good tank and damn good heals. Character identity is weakened, Being Full bear goes from a rarity to something every druid devotes a spec towards.
---
Everyone knew Flight Paths and dungeons would be ganked. What most people didn't envision was that every square inch in-between was also going to be covered by tryhards.
---
Most classes PvE rotations contain of 1 spell, but Warriors have alot more buttons they are able to press
---
I'd love to have it on my prot pally. Reactive damage is awesome for AoE farming.
---
thats more like a face pull
---
This is the biggest factor for sure.  Just a small example: A priest's greater heal originally had a cast time of 5 seconds(4 if talented) until patch 1.9.  Just imagine how much more difficult healing would have been with that cast time.  And that's only one example out of dozens.  Retail Vanilla WoW was a very different game compared to what we are playing now in classic.
---
Honor is server specific. You are ranked against other people, on your faction, on your server.
---
Every server and associated faction on that server will be different.
---
Huge mega servers will generally be harder to rank up on, smaller servers will generally be easier.
---
If you are on the faction that dominates the server balance wise, ranking will be harder, if you're on the faction that does not have the larger population ranking will be easier.
---
if you think he got banned solely on the basis of ganking asmon, youre a dummy.
---
There's always 1% of resist chance that you can't remove.
---
You can be 60 and casting a spell to a lvl 1 mob, he still has that 1% resist.
---
Im leveling as enhance currently but doing basically only instance runs. I join as healer and whack stuff with my staff when everyone is at sufficient hp. Goes much faster when you act as a 4th dps even if you are not damaging at full capacity.
---
I am the all-seeing-eye
---
I mean rag fight last maybe a minute and a half and is very very range friendly. Not really the best fight to pick to show it’s viable...
---
If you had any clue, you wouldn't of posted your opinion like I was being 100% serious. 
---
You must be naive or oblivious since you continue to reply to me further proving you're an idiot.
---
This is my current raiding spec: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/5-5005202105023051-50105301
---
There are some points you can play with (Imp Heal wave vs Tidal Focus, 2 pts in GW can go into Guardian Totems) but this is a pretty good mix of a maxed out PVE build while also keeping SS to help with solo farming / dungeon running.
---
For PVP, you'll likely wanna go more into enhance.  This is the build I've been looking at switching to for PVP: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000150003-5005220105023151
---
I'd like to test this out some more, see if Toughness is potentially worth getting (Hunters/Rogues are my hardest matchups but not sure an extra ~250 armor would make a difference).
---
My guild had 2 tanks, "Who" and "What". Rip Libra
---
I mean he's not breaking TOS. Asmon is just a cry baby that should have gone to a PVE server.
---
Maybe pvp servers, there are plenty pve servers with an alliance bias. Mine is 25/75 H/A.
---
But really, people are salty af for the fact that pvp servers have pvp. PvP isn't always fair, and it may not always be fun. 
---
I got camped for 30 minutes yesterday by 4 of the opposing faction, so I called in some friends and people in the zone. Problem resolved you little snowflake
---
You kids need to get a fucking life.
---
Then what else did he do? Stop being so vague.
---
There were several websites with full class guides and leveling strategies before the game even launched.
---
&gt; Obviously if they preferred to level on a pve server they would have done it.
---
That is not at all obvious, which is why we get people like OP whining about being on a pvp server and how Blizzard should fix their mistake.
---
If you are in a random group , by yourself or just running with a random band of people then yes.
---
If you're running with a real team who works together you should be the back line, healing everyone, and when you come under attack the entire group should collapse around you to defend.
---
Our raids have 11 warriors, I'll be happy if I get even one raid weapon drop before the end of classic.
---
It takes a pretty special mind to boil down the problems of being on a horribly imbalanced PvP server into the last frame.
---
I'll add that they took the same approach as private servers : using the latest talents, gear, npc locations, loot tables etc... and simply unlocking raids &amp; dungeons to imitate patches. Granted they went further than most by also locking a lot of items, but it's still not really good enough imo.
---
When you're exploring zones and cities, you can see a ton of npcs which are just useless. They have repeatable quests or dialogues that don't make sense, because they were added with later raids, and the only way to make sense of it as a new player is to go search on wowhead. I know that they didn't have earlier versions saved anywhere, but they still could've tried a bit harder to recreate vanilla imo.
---
If she can use a controller you could get the Consoleport addon and use that to play. Thats how I leveled my Paladin.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port
---
No they didnt.  Any knowledgable person was predicting MC and Ony to be complete cakewalk loot pinatas.  They dont call it Molten Snore for no reason.
---
As I said in most mc fights I am top 5 dps, Most fights are under 3 mins. Overall damage is also higher than most as well. MC and Im guessing BWL will be the same way, ZG and AQ we'll see some fall off. For now stop shitting on us and actually see our potential.
---
If fury dw is around 750-800 dps, how does 2h arms or fury compare? Are we talking 600-700 dps?
---
PVP happened on a PVP server.
---
&gt;  and have free choice what to bring, including an enhancer is simply not optimal. Your link is a good example, just checking most other bossfights than the one you linked shows the discrepancy in dps that is hard to make up for with the provided buffs. You seem to have a pretty amazing shadow priest btw. What I am writing is mostly about correcting this other dude who claims enhancement is the ultimate dps upgrade over anything else.
---
Loud and Clear.   I'm just saying when you crush content like us, and have a relaxed environment it doesn't matter.   I've struck the lotto by having a raid spot and getting sulfuras.   Our priest crushes, he pops tons of consumes  to keep it high.
---
I use scroll wheel click for my autorun, so it leaves the side buttons free for other abilities/macros
---
Right, you have to be carrying keys or reagents on your character in order to use them.
---
I literally couldnt tell you what the dekographic of my server is, or even give you a ballpark "they knew they were going to have a numerical advantage" if they started day 1 theres no way they couldve even had any idea. Dumbass.
---
You're not wrong, its just that I think its easier to get everyone on board for server transfers before faction transfers simply because Faction xfers weren't a thing in Vanilla but Server xfers were.
---
If you walk around a rough neighborhood waving around $500 (also taunting others) and get robbed, no one feels bad for you. You knew the risks. 
---
&gt;would you tell waitresses who get sexually harassed or even assaulted "Shouldn't be a waitress, it's your own fault, just get a different job"?
---
A waitress being harassed or assaulted is not something that is expected of their job. 
---
Being killed in a video game *is* part of your job. It's known it'll happen, and known that if you scream "All horde suck, I'm going to use my fan base to kill you. Also, here's my currently location in real time, but you're not allowed to use that to kill me" *is* going to lead to you being ganked over and over. 
---
Just because your job is twitch, and you only want the benefits of being a streamer, but not the side effects doesn't mean you get the freedom from consequences.
---
Yeah you’re right, maybe. Lol. Neither of us are economists tho, we’re taking shots in the dark. For this to be the case, blizz would have to only allow the transfers in a small window of time. If it is always an option people will abuse it. And if you have a small window, People will scramble almost mindlessly and you’ll have a clusterfuck of disrupted servers.  I took the precaution of not committing to a server until week 2 after launch. I started out on Herod, went to stalagg, thunder fury and white mane, all of those were lopsided so I settled on sulfuras. And so far it seems pretty balanced. Not 50/50 but damn close to it.
---
Since everyone can grab fishing I would reccomend fishing wreckage and water essences out of azshara. The greens from mithril chests and the occasional golden pearl sell quite quickly. Also stonescale eels and oily blackmouth sell well for use in armor pots and free action potions. Not sure the gold per hour but it got me to my epic mount.
---
None of that matters. If you have a character on a server...any alts would still have to be that faction and you can only play 1 character at a time... So no matter how many alts u have ur still considered 1 to your faction population.
---
Did they call 877-CASH NOW?
---
Even then there are twice as many PvP servers as there are PvE servers on NA, and PvE servers seem to have lower populations on average.
---
Honestly if you actually believe that and isn't just being dishonest I don't even know what to say
---
Grass isn't always greener. Wait 2 hours to play the game and actually enjoy it or log in whenever you want and have no fun playing the game. If you can't handle the pvp you should have rolled on a pve server. This is pretty bad but you had to expect something like this coming from Herod who imbalance favors the horde 60/40 or 65/35 depending on what you look at. If alliance are low on Herod you can expect that the imbalance for the new server is going favor alliance because they want to leave this imbalance and not have a queue.
---
just got gutgore ripper but still wanna go swords, do i use gutgore ripper in oh instead of dalrend either way? got dalrend mh too

I was making a joke about how all of this is a waste of time

There are some other minor ones to do things like move my tooltips and omniCC but that's pretty much it to get it looking like what you see.

You can do this on wowhead now
---
Good point. If you're using edgemaster's handguards, dense sharpening stones on both weapons, and have a brutality blade in the mainhand, then I get this comparison for non-human alliance:
---
Flurry Axe offhand - 743.7 dps  
---
Bonescraper offhand - 735.5 dps  
---
Mirah's Song offhand - 729.5 dps
---
And similarly, with the same order, for the horde (740, 737, and 730 dps, respectively).
---
It's a good alternative that saves a lot of gold.
---
I think my sense of humor is broken, I laughed way too hard at that lol
---
Cheers OP
---
He’s openly harassing which is against the twitch ToS. I mean that’s basically it.
---
You can also change your name by deleting your char and getting someone to take that name on there account. 
---
Restore the character and it will prompt you with a name change. 
---
Thats if you dont want to flag your account with a forced name change on it.
---
Have you watched advertise's youtube vids, he has plenty of examples and I don't remember him even mentioning how he was camped. Meanwhile asmon cries about dieing on a PVP server and says shit like "i can easily get him banned if I wanted to".
---
Honestly with a hotspot (back when internet options were a bit complicated in my area) I was able to play CSGO to a high level, around 50ms to the coast from Missouri.  
---
It's really not that bad, the only thing is your ping is about a +- 9ms, so a bit of extra variance but very playable. I don't see why something far less ping sensitive would be a problem.
---
Data usage is pretty reasonable as well.
---
It's still targeted. The only difference is who started it.
---
&gt; You must be naive or oblivious since you continue to reply to me further proving you're an idiot.
---
Ahh the old "if you keep replying I'm winning and you're stupid" reversal strategy.
---
A timeless classic. I see you are a veteran.
---
&lt;charge&lt;battle+demo shout&lt; tab sunders&lt; revenge when possible
---
Of course you were going to be camped.. are you really joking right now that you *didnt* think hat would be a thing?
---
I think if your server has a high faction imbalance. Allow the players that are the dominate force free server transfers. 
---
Only allow them to transfer to a server that would not perpetuate the problem. Rather than instant transfer. Everyone gets a reserved slot in the new realm, once Blizz does their calculations and is comfortable with the ratio, they initiate transfer.
---
Whole guilds + friends could ensure they all transfer. 
---
Or just let it sort itself out like it did Vanilla. I am fine with either, bgs are going to change the game. And that's just around the corner.
---
LOLLL bro who the fuck thinks someone would lie about their mom being on disability ?
---
You're so very butthurt.
---
Likely for the double swing proc from Flurry Axe. Not sure what kinda dream this guy is having, though.
---
Thats what spell clickers do, it helps them to visually sort the spells. The blank spaces helps the eye to recognize faster where the spell is, so they can click faster.
---
True I forgot
---
Oof sounds like wow classic isn’t the game for you
---
Agree a dodged couple Ony hits as a mage. Feels good
---
He insulted him because of what Advertise was doing. That didnt come from nothing and not even close to what advertise was doing nor even anything ban worthy.
---
This defense that there is no evidence that he stream snipes is laughable. You're not in a court. People can see the obvious, this is a child's mentality. I dont know who you're trying to convince other then to just reinforce your own delusions. Also not ban-able.
---
And? He camps his guild mates all the time, they cant retaliate?Asmon isn't the one doing it.
---
In isolation, what you say is likely true. However, I imagine the idea is that, when combined with faction-specific transfers, you would incentivize the advantaged faction to reduce their population to be more in-line with a healthier faction balance. Currently, no such incentive exists outside of people having a harder time ranking due to lack of targets available. Just food for thought.
---
I can smell your fear through the internet
---
Holy fuck. Fuck asmongold. What an absolute baby. And fuck twitch for catering to this man child
---
what? having your title and entirety of the stream be about harrasing a partnered streamer isnt against twitch TOS?
---
Most likely due to the stats. Alliance doesn’t have access to WF and unlike Orcs Flurry Axe isn’t a viable OH to proc MH swings.
---
Shouldn't even get banned. He's playing the game's rules. Even has videos of killing streamers when they're not streaming. Asmon should get banned if anything, but I know that will never happen.
---
Solo leveling my shaman and I'm in STV right now. 
---
You guys are *vicious* and I love it,
---
Ah got you. I was confusing myself thinking I worded myself wrong, you were just more detailed in your response.
---
&gt; Any activity, such as cheating, hacking, botting, or tampering, that gives the account owner an unfair advantage in an online multiplayer game, is prohibited. This also includes exploiting another broadcaster's live broadcast in order to harass them in-game, such as stream sniping.

---
&gt;Faction xfers weren't a thing in Vanilla but Server xfers were.
---
So what, the server cap is already increased anyways and the changes blizz has made has been good.
---
&gt; its just that I think its easier to get everyone on board for server transfers 
---
But what would it even do? The stats on the servers aren't public, and blizz broke the census addons. So you are transfering blindly anyways unless you are planning to play with your friends on the next server.
---
For all you know you transfer from a server with lets say 0 alliance, to another server with 0 alliance.
---
To be fair, most of EVE's time-honored traditions constitute bannable offences in other MMOs.
---
then you do you, I'm just giving advice for everyone else lol
---
If advertise deserves a ban then so does asmongold. Otherwise this is blatant favoritism
---
I told you it was a joke in the next few comments multiple times but you continued on as if I was 100% serious. 
---
I'm not sure what else to tell you if you're continuing to be daft.
---
Your the warrior who's rich enough and plays enough to respec between raids.
---
how? wtf are you talking about is asmongolds ENTIRE EXISTENCE on twitch cosists of harrasing a partnered streamer? if not then go re learn what double standard means buddy.
---
The game is actually a piece of shit and if you had fun being unable to play for half an hour then wtf go stare at a wall and have fun then.
---
Exactly.
---
I know, it‘s just for nostaglic reasons
---
Without going into details aka I’m not giving any evidence for my bullshit
---
He's not harassing them, he's killing them on a PVP server. He is playing the game. He has videos killing them when they aren't even streaming. If they don't like it, they should go to a PVE server.
---
Get her a USB dance pad XD
---
Cheap Shot, Hemo, Hemo. That normally gives 5 points. Then a coldblood Eviscerate if I think it will kill them, or a kidney shot and some more hemos. If they aren’t close to dead I will blind at the end of the KS, re-stealth, and reopen into the evisc.
---
The moment they offer paid PvP to PvE xfers my entire guild and i are gone. Fairbanks is a shit show and not worth staying around on.
---
Amazing, the last image is exactly how I imagine those ”why did you roll a PvP server DUHHHH lul lul”
---
Any ani-poison could remove blind, but problem is that you can't use them while blinded.  
---
For example if druid cast Abolish Poison on himself before - blind would be cleansed.
---
world pvp now isnt even the same as it was a year before on privates, current classic wow is radically different from anything before due to blizzards weird rulesets for the game such as content availability, patches and server limitations
---
getting a group of 12-15 and running around brm is still fun.
---
Bro you already murdered me with that last reversal, how am I supposed to reply now?
---
The unblockable "no ur stupid" deflection. RIP.
---
So the original OP of this thread was asking why it was bannable, to which someone else implied there was more going on here. Are you saying there isn't more going on here and that ganking is harassment, or that they were doing more than just ganking? If it's the former, then I should totally report everyone who's ever ganked me in a PVP realm. If it's the latter, again, why so vague?
---
Same thing for my guild, no bindings since but thats ok.
---
How will just queue from Undercity and fly to the Plaguelands to gank levelers.
---
I saw many people shitting on asmongold get timed out/banned. Try again asmon shill
---
Shard of (Talisman of Binding) = either left of right binding of the windseeker cmon people its in the name
---
This is the big delima on my server (sulfuras) havnt found a decent tank my whole journey on my shaman from 1-60, they were so bad that i ended up going a tank build on my shaman cuz even that was way better then w/e the hell they were doing.
---
I raid log now since 5/10man content is just a bother, wait 2 hours and get a shit tank.
---
Made my own warrior lvl 52 now and tank all my dungeons.
---
Did join a zf group where they had mallet and only needed a dps, their prot warrior couldnt hild aggro against me so i became the tank.
---
RIP Nip TMC
---
Asmongold is very popular. i really dont understand why.
---
Being able to break fear is great vs warriors too. Intimidating shout is used to stop the «deadzone» kiting
---
&gt; So what, the server cap is already increased anyways and the changes blizz has made has been good.
---
I agree with you, and imo I'm party #changes I'm just saying the likelyhood you're going to convince Blizzard to go further along the #changes path to get Faction xfers is unlikely.
---
&gt;The stats on the servers aren't public, and blizz broke the census addons. So you are transfering blindly anyways
---
Apart of my post says that Blizzard should publicly show the balance ratios to avoid blind xfers.
---
“Proof? He has a video up of every time he’s killed him so far, as well as Esfand, and how he gets information from other people.” Please show me this proof of video evidence of the 100s of times throughout the past 2 months he’s killed them, I’ll be waiting patiently.
---
Dang!!!!! Lucky
---
Boo
---
What can I watch / do to get better at PvP as a rogue? I have not particularly played the class long and I am rather poor and seem to get destroyed most of the time. I just seem to panic, button mash and not achieve much. 
---
I am combat sword spec (I'm 34, so for levelling) which isn't ideal I know but do feel I have more in my toolkit than just being able to gouge and vanish away.
---
Doesn't seem to be a blizzard problem, seems to be more of a YOU problem.
---
In between bulwark and UC is just fucking brutal.
---
Had a hunter gquit for not being allowed to roll on this.
---
Does the mage talent Permafrost affect the snare from the talent Improved Blizzard?
---
Yeah asmongold is such a pathetic piece of shit. Makes millions of dollars watching YouTube videos and he still is too much of a baby to put up with advertise, which has been the best content for his stream since classic
---
That's what I figured, wasn't really sure about how it relates to other melee necklaces, tho, in terms of dmg
---
Yeah that makes sense. Thanks.
---
It also shares a CD with other transmutes, right? So if you were doing Arcanite (about 8g/2d) it decreases your increased profit to 11g/xmute, or 177 day payoff - which is May 22nd 2020.
---
All this assumes water won't drop in price over time (which it has on Herod from about 18g to ~15g as of last night).
---
Can I do solo DME runs? Do you have a guide or video for that?
---
If I made a guild on the horde called "Olympus falling" and dedicated my whole stream to taking out Olympus' leadership, thats against the ToS of twitch?
---
The only time I was like holy shit this tank is amazing was when I ran with my big guilds MT lol. I'm one of the casuals of the guild and only been to one raid night so far. But I finally have more pre raid bis than not 
---
 Anywyas it was as if he didn't take damage or lose threat. It was insane. I've never healed for such a heated tank. There was some fights I didn't even heal lol just toss a renew and help dps 
---
 My most recent run however costed me a few mana pots and a demon rune. It was either that or wipe so lol
---
Have you watched his stream at all?  Obviously not you are just another asmon fanboy spouting bullshit
---
You're quite a weird breed of person. I'm amazed someone could be so hard headed.
---
Funny you say that, I started in Stalagg alliance and left when Heartseeker first opened because of the 10K que that was still present a few weeks in.  On Heartseeker’s discord I’ve lost count of how many times someone from the ally side says things like “man I wish alliance was on a 20/80” or “I would rather be on the inferior side than the dominant (pop wise) side any day” arguments. 
---
In all honestly people want balanced or close to it. No one wants to be on the faction that gets camped on FPs or get rolled in a obscured place in EPL by a 5 man hunting party. But they say it to make the opposite faction feel better
---
Or like it’s some blessing.
---
No he isn't. One that shit is reportable in WoW itself, but two this is a TWITCH BAN not a WoW ban.
---
It is against twitch's TOS to harass another streamer.
---
Easiest no fun 1 shot combo is 
---
cheap shot -&gt; 1 or 2 hemos -&gt; kidney before cheap shot ends -&gt; hemo until near 0 energy -&gt; thistle tea -&gt; hemo until 5 combo points -&gt; cold blood evicerate
---
Obviously this combo wastes a thistle tea so I only use it only high priority targets that I absolutely want to 1 shot.
---
But you can do the same combo and swap the thistle tea with a blind right before the kidney expires, restealth, then cheap shot into cold blood evicerate. This takes a bit longer but gets the job done just the same.
---
True
---
Sorry, let me be clear.
---
I’m not going to feel bad for someone who gets paid to play video games if playing the video game becomes less fun. Most us have jobs that are not fun. So if Asmon is having a bad time playing WoW, boo hoo. He’s probably having more fun than me and making more money to boot. He doesn’t need my sympathy, he’ll be *fine*.
---
naw im going to join a more balanced server. I dont like being camped 7v1
---
Thunderfury, though
---
My rank 10 pvp warlock has around 5400hp unbuffed, I can try to find some screenshots, fully buffed with pvp banner it was 7400hp as I remember.
---
AQ killed a ton of guilds on private servers, where the average player skill was way higher
---
Yes but did you know it was a legendary in the game that actually dropped? It was an amazing tank necklace that was removed from Baron Geddon's loot table.
---
What a horribly incorrect analogy.
---
He literally had a youtube video where you could hear Asmongold's stream going on in the background....
---
rogue cc OP
---
&gt;Apart of my post says that Blizzard should publicly show the balance ratios to avoid blind xfers.
---
Yes, but it would be weird for them to do that when they recently broke the census addons just to hide the stats.
---
If they don't want to show playernumbers, fine. But they can at least show percentiles.
---
Are you saying my 39 Ret Paladin with 800AP isn’t balanced?!? /s
---
That entirely depends on the quality of the player and direction of the guild.
---
In a top end 99% guild where almost all of the DPS are also 99% sure gear out your Warriors first. Which means the player has most likely farmed their lionheart helm or any other necessary items (Edgemaster etc).
---
The vast majority of players won’t fit into the top 1%.
---
So having a priority list that says all Fury Warriors should get weapons first is a bit dense.
---
From last night:
---
Tank&gt; Put away your VW, it's distracting
---
Me&gt; I'll keep it away from you
---
5 minutes later he pulls too many (charges in to too many groups). He does a valiant effort of taking out half and leaving the rest around half health, but he goes down.
---
VW backup Tank is deployed and we survive.
---
That's why I have VW in dungeons under max level.
---
Yeah definitely, I'm not an economist but I know for sure that having less players in total isn't good for a servers health long term and the current situation is causing players to quit.
---
sorry to necro, is there an addon to split the screen in game?
---
I'll have to take a closer look when I get home from work, since I can't check any of the wowhead links. Looks to be very consumable heavy, which doesn't seem worth it. If you get Nightfall, though, this could be a great way to stay useful beyond just being a debuff pawn.
---
If you can land a sap on the player and kill the minion, it will greatly increase your chances of success since the pet is generally quite vital to their kit.
---
No one else is impressed that he got a paladin to level 63 in vanilla?  =p
---
my mage used that neck until like level 55 or so. its funny to me seeing all these loot drama posts from leveling 5mans.. mr warlock is gonna have a real good time trying to understand how loot works in a classic raid. ill keep the popcorn warm on my end.. my mage never did get the cath hat, lost 3 of them to shamans but didnt pitch a fit about it, because im an ADULT!

Whether you like it or not the guy is right. He may not be explaining it in the nicest manner but you came here for advice, and his is spot on. But just insult him right?
---
It's ok, that bothered me as well. Tin has too low a melting point to properly form an alloy with iron.
---
I had a great 19 rogue twink back in vanilla.  Optimized gear to include engineering headpiece, dual +15 agility enchants on both daggers, best blues I could find in WC and/or auction house, and everything else enchanted to the max.  He was unstoppable.  I remember taking on 4 people simultaneously, I killed 3 of them and probably would have killed the 4th but then a 5th joined the  fight.  They /spit on me after killing me.  That twink was the only time I ever truly one-shotted someone in pvp, some poor lvl 10 mage had decided to join WSG, and a single backstab killed him instantly.  Sorry for the long narrative, but my point is, awesome gear plus stealth and dual-wield makes you a powerhouse even at 19.  Maybe other classes are better, but I never felt outmatched.
---
Made your choice. Knew world pvp would be a mess if the ratios are skewed. Moving to another realm leaves the original realm ratio even more skewed. And doesn’t necessarily mean that the new realm will be any better. They need to implement something to balance the faction disparity. Free faction changes then one way on realms where it’s gotten too bad.
---
Generally it's pretty obvious when a player is new to the game, or at least pvp, and here is no exception. Like they have watched enough videos of good rogues to be able to mimic what they do, but still doesnt really know what they are doing.
---
Enjoy the hour long BG queues if you're on a faction that dominates the server.
---
Without going into any details, I wouldn't be surprised to see /u/shitposting_in_here arrested for pedophilia here in the next few days.
---
Thanks for this. I'd love any advice on how to do a better comparison that accounts for the way the spreadsheet overweights weapon skill past 5 or attempts to model how much it's being overvalued.
---
&gt;It’s dumb because it’s an inferior server...
---
You are an elitist troll. 
---
Forgive those of us that are *filthy casuals* and actually enjoy the spirit of the game. 
---
Hardcore PvP is not the only way to play the game. 
---
Again, the complaints in and of themselves are moot if the given solution is heeded. 
---
It must be such a taxing thing to your psyche knowing that deep down I am right. 
---
Your poor defense of PvP being superior makes you sad and your lashing out at care bears makes you pathetic. 
---
Good luck in life, you sad troll.
---
Asmon has literally made a martyr out of a mole hill... Great job, genius.
---
The age old classic "I cannot refute my opponent, and as such I will choose to mock them"
---
Because it needs a reagent.  I've noticed any spells that need a reagent wont show the macro name because the priority is show the qty of reagents left.
---
In pvp? Lol...
---
I have the exact same experience in the same room. Always around the Sulfuron Harbinger/Golemagg turning point.
---
And how should blizz "encourage" faction balance, please tell.
---
Imposible to prove.
---
Eventually I'd imagine pugs to be able to tackle most Vanilla content. I saw some crazy stuff even 15 years ago, these days information and communication are both so much easier to achieve.
---
Interesting.  What are the twink items for 19 hunters?  I've never heard of a twink hunter before
---
&gt;Sell em as herbs the rest of the days
---
Disagree.  Pool them, and sell potions on tuesday.
---
The model was meant to represent rouges not warriors. I don’t know enough about rage generation, rotation, or abilities to fully analyze warriors yet.
---
But the same idea would apply to calculate the damage increase for an ability that does 45% of ap but you would also have to factor in more abilities being used if more rage is generated. Let’s say you have 1000 ap, for warriors, I don’t think you get any ap from agility so you are trading off crit and dodge (matters for tanks?) for ap. So the ability would do 1000x0.45 versus 1022x0.45 which is a 2.2% increase in ability damage if you ignor the change to crit percent. If your AP is at 2000, 22 ap only raises damage of this ability by 1.1% if you factor in the loss of crit then the benefit is actually less.
---
The way I would model this, which can’t be captured well here, would be to determine the optimum rotation for abilities based on rage cost and Cooldown time, estimate the rage generation rate and apply to the rotation for total ability damage per rotation, add up white damage and ability damage and convert to average dps.
---
How does rage generation change with attack power specifically? If you hit for 100 versus 200 do you generate twice the rage? If rage scales with damage output that makes this a really crazy and interesting optimization problem to solve.
---
&gt; You keep deleting memes for low effort, even if they’re not. Can you just let the community be the judge of if it’s funny or not?
---
This is a crucial misunderstanding of how reddit works. The community doesn't vote for what they like. They vote for what is easy to consume. MOST votes are from casual readers casually browsing and upvoting what takes the least amount of effort to consume.
---
Czanza takes the phrase "don't let your memes be dreams" to a whole new level.
---
You can be best tank on lvl 48-52 but if your dps want to have aggro, he will pull it from you, especially aoe dps.
---
I got invited into 2 guild run pug MC raids with 40 and 50 gear on me. I'm a PvP focused shadowpriest. I don't have issues getting into raids (so far). I was even able to roll on the eye of divinity and won it.
---
I guess your answers will just come from experience. Some will tell you no and others yes. As long as there are yes's going around, I suggest you roll whatever you want and play it how ever you want. If you do not get accepted into a raid and they have something negative to say to you (about your class), then move on and try again later. Unless it's these sort of people you want to be playing with, then I suggest not rolling a shadow priest. I sometimes get into the mood of wanting to be in an elite guild, getting high gear in the highly disciplined and structured fashion. But it's not me.
---
Cheapshot-&gt;Hemo-&gt;Hemo-&gt;Kidney-&gt;Hemo-&gt;Blind-&gt;Stealth-&gt;Cheapshot-&gt;ColdBlood Eviscerate
---
That's a lame reason.
---
He's fighting none, they are fighting him :)
---
"He isn't using the plattform twitch to harass asmongold"
---
Streams it on twitch, uses asmongold's name in titles while he is doing these things on twitch. 
---
His guild, they can camp people after being camped themselves. The people who are on twitch cant do anything unless they play the game.
---
No, it doesn't warrant a ban when hes responding to a guy who is trash talking him. Nor has he said anything that warrants a ban.
---
Probably a joke but not sure if meants as RP. Do RP'ers often use lol?
---
Bags, elixirs, and health potions. Some level appropriate weapons. A bunch of cloth to level first aid. Stam food. Items of the monkey/bear. Enough gold to train skills.
---
Yerrrrrrr
---
Absolute neckbeard of a reply r/iamverysmart
---
plays lol, checks out
---
I’m really jealous of your situation after reading this. I really wish I rolled a PvE server and it’s crazy to me that I’m going to lose my joy for this game due some poor community management.
---
Interface &gt; names&gt; titles
---
There's an abundance on my server too, but I still make money on them.  GFPP is easily 50s+ per potion, especially if i buy ele fires low during the week and sell the pots on tuesday.  I sold something like 50 pots just last night buying low posted ele fires that day, I could make more buying up low ele fires more aggressively during the week.
---
did you expect me to respond with a thank you while he was being an asshole? and the question had already been answered well-before he got in here
---
You mental gymnastics are incredible and your audacity to call someone childish as a blantant fanboy is just laughable.
---
Advertise doesn't have to defend himself as the accusations are lauable and the traditional way streamers react to being killed (see ninja as a famous example). Advertise has some fame. If someone sees asmongold in an area and dislikes him, they will maybe whisper advertise his location. Maybe the person making the whisper is watching the stream. Don't know. What I do know however is that the accusation of being stream sniped in BRM is ridiculous. You are deluding yourself if you think someone needs streamsniping to find you when both of you are in BRM. Similar to many times where Advertise is killing asmongold on stream and you can clearly see where he is getting is intel from.
---
Advertise is probably getting some of his intel from streamsnipers. However, he can't verify how someone who whispers him is getting the location of asmongold.
---
But the most important thing is: you have zero prove of him streamsniping. Nothing.
---
Massacre happened on a PvP server. 
---
Wpvp is garbage. It isn’t true pvp.
---
Sap cannot he used on mobs that are in combat, if you’re going to use sap (we did in vanilla, less so now) it has to be before anything else happens. Common for me in UBRS near the end was sap, sprint to the tank, sheep as mobs run to the party, tanks pickup the rest.
---
Snowflake? I'm in the majority on an 80:20 server. Faction imbalance sucks ass on both sides of the coin.
---
:D
---
Not quite Vanilla because battlegrounds and an expansion or two were implemented but I wanted to share my experience none the less.
---
firey weapon enchants, gear with agi/stam, and plenty of cloth so you always have a ton of the best bandages you can make.
---
I really think this is an age thing. As a kid, dumping an hour into a quest seemed like such a long time. Now as an adult, the passage of time is much faster and things that seemed super long and difficult before feel like a chill change of pace from normal questing.
---
What hateful and harassing things has he done to asmon?
---
A HORDE PLAYER COMPLAINING? GIT GUD
---
Oh okay. I walked over there when I was questing in Duskwood and the area was empty. Good to know something is supposed to be there.
---
And I browse exclusively on PC, confirmation bias doesn't actually give any real statistics. So people claiming some bullshit 90% numbers are just pulling it out of their ass, is my point.
---
Rage scales with damage output. I don't have the exact formula but hitting for more damage generates more rage. 
---
It gets very complex and ends up depending on the armor of the boss you are hitting, exactly which buffs and debuffs are being used in the raid, etc.
---
Multiple ways to encourage faction balance actually.
---
You could do a sliding scale XP bonus depending on the percentage of imbalance, like:
---
1:1 = No difference.
---
2:1 = 20% bonus for less dominant side
---
3:1 = 30% bonus for less dominant side
---
4:1 = 40%, etc, etc... 
---
all the way to 75%.  Plus, have that work in concordance with rested XP; which means for a maximum bonus, WITH rested, a character would be earning XP at 3.5 times un-rested and un-bonused would get.
---
Another way to do it is to close off a faction for character creation when the average login over the last 7 days shows a greater than 3 to 1 imbalance.
---
Another way to do it is to increase the Auction House tax in scale with the imbalance.
---
Finally, a way to do it is to have a single layer UNTIL population balance is 2:1 or greater, then introduce layering along faction lines so 1 for 1 alliance and horde on a single layer until you run out of either faction, then the rest of everyone else gets jammed onto the other ones.
---
Anything wrong with that or?..
---
I want to pvp. The play style I like is just being able to shred someone before they have a chance, so kinda like a glass cannon but with high dps and isn’t completely screwed if I have to fight like 2-3 guys. I am open to any class just wanna have super high dps and just to be able to shred 1 guy for sure 2 guys max or else I’m screwed kinda play style
---
I've played many classes to 60 in vanilla (paladin, warlock, druid, rogue, shaman) and 2 to 60 here in classic (mage, warrior).
---
I'm a 3 time gladiator on my warlock and got gladiator on 3 classes in S4 in BC.
---
I have to say that tanking 5 man dungeons might be the hardest thing there is to do in classic wow. When I first started playing again I started getting hand/finger cramps/pains due to the insane amount of kcpm I was having to do while tanking.
---
so when blizz implement realm xfers, it will also be my choice to transfer off. Any new realm I would be xferring to would be better then dealing with 30/70 ratio
---
Depends on server.  My server makes a profit on almost every pot.  I can make 50s minimum on greater fire protection, though typically 1g+ due to when I buy mats and sell potions.
---
This kid don't know what he talking about 4:1.  Ally just gave up.
---
Who did Asmongold target for harassment over several days (maybe weeks), with an entire youtube channel dedicated to that person, alongside with his stream titles containing his name everytime? Cause thats what Advertise did with Asmongold.
---
True theres always gonna be player accounts that maybe play a couple hrs a week or havnt logged in for awhile, that would add to a factions total population count yet are barely active to truly count. But its not like blizz doesnt know how often an account logs into a certain server per week.
---
Dual Spec is by all means not a bad thing but it takes a bit away from a traditional RPG experience. Respecing is there if you need it, but its not something you can just swap around often as you would an item or consumable. It holds you a little more accountable and causes you to take a more serious investment into your spec that is the basis for other items you choose to use.
---
Limitations often create more interesting moments in games. Some people pick a spec that's not that great but it's what they like, and that's what matters most.
---
If Blizzard dont resolve this issue, the future of classic will not be positive.
---
So making videos about someone is harassment?
---
Your definition is incredibly subjective.
---
You trolling?
---
Sometimes you can't prove it, but there are MANY cases where it's VERY simple to prove...wtf...
---
Not when youre doing more dmg than them, my dmg range never drops below 36% and goes as high as 42% of the groups total dmg. Arms tanking is the way to go for 5/10mans. Prot is mediocre even in raids.
---
Flare is definetely not protocol for a sportsmanlike 1v1
---
A hunter can just AFK on his Flare until the rogue gives up and open without stealth, which is more horrible for rogue than getting opened on is for a hunter
---
You won’t be getting a new realm. At least not for an OCE player.
---
I'd love to see honor points disabled outside of battlegrounds. Give us the organic phase 1 PVP we signed up for, and remove the rankers from world PVP.
---
Then how is asmongold not banned. He literally insulted him on stream, resulting in advertise being brigaded and sent his guild to camp him. How is that not against ToS?
---
Hence the word "chill" in the post title
---
&gt; You seem to have a pretty amazing shadow priest btw.
---
MOM! Get the camera.
---
It's kind of like Blizzard joked about wanting that or something lol.
---
Looks like he's just trying to get a bunch of mainhand extra attacks.
---
He is the owner of a discord solely dedicated to spying, calling out, and organizing gank squads to kill asmon. His entire following is bases around Asmon hate, he doesn’t moderate his chat at all and actually encourages the hate circlejerk for other streamers(against the twitch rules under harassment).
---
Vanilla WoW had paid server transfers in patch 1.12. Not allowing paid transfers is a change.
---
Lol. What.
---
Are you talking PVE or PVP?  Because PVE raid specs do take ruin and either SM or DS in aff/demo, and dont stack crit at the expensive of an equivalent amount of SP (sims between 9-14 depending on your gear and buffs currently).
---
In pvp, its harder to value.
---
By starting with faction specific transfers **before** things got out of hand. Is it really that difficult to understand?
---
no more annoying voice, baby
---
I lft my initial server at launch because of the 8 hours queues, now I regret it very much, but don't wanna leave my pimped out lvl 60 to rot and restart. Now the game is on hold right now, waiting for paid transfer to be announced.
---
Okay thank you very much! I'll try it later and give you another update.
---
Does Tidal Charm share a diminishing return with any hunter abilities other than intimidation/improved concussive shot?
---
Wondering if I can tidal -&gt; freezing trap in place of scatter trap against non-melee until I actually hit 60 and respec to MM.
---
Rogue. It’s a rogue.
---
I guess Druid works too.
---
Not the only thing that's hard you sexy piece of shit.
---
Private servers retuned a lot of the bosses, for example with higher armor and health values.
---
cant reply with facts so you rely on that, go ahead pick on grammar like i give a fuck.
---
We need the paid transfers in original classic, they had a 3 month cd and it was pvp to pvp or pve, no pve to pvp.  Let's do it
---
Yeah it’s kind of frustrating how people are so quick to shit on each other’s points and beliefs without actually critically thinking.
---
The inn at Goldshire is a common location for erotic roleplayers
---
Give it three months. Meanwhile re roll. It's just a game. Yeah it's a time invested but I mean your still playing otherwise. Then when transfer open bring over that main. 
---
 When I go to mail something I see my other toons pop up. So does that mean I can mail a bag from one server to another ?
---
Nothing wrong with one maybe two, as long as raid doesn't have a bunch of ret paladins and feral druids. (1 maybe two of each)
---
How so? He showed how he found him on and offstream a lot of times, it’s really not a rocket science to find someone with a huge target on their back.
---
go read twitch TOS on partner harrasment part this dude fit it in every which way possible needed for a ban.
---
#NoChanges was a player made tag. Blizz never backed this in the least.
---
It's fun because it's dangerous to both parties involved lol
---
Hmm, suggested channels? This must be in line with other streams I watch...oh, okay Twitch
---
I've heard far worse lies, frankly. I wouldn't put it passed a fair few streamers.
---
But hey, unless I'm presented to evidence on the contrary, I'd default to believing him.
---
Hahhahahaha this is pathetic. Millionaire cries because he's being killed in a game...corporation bans player doing it. What dimension is this.
---
Sneeeky necro inbound...
---
This sheet is missing random enchantment gear. For instance, Slaghide Gauntlets (the arcane ones that are admittedly impossible to get) are technically better than Earth Warder's Gloves, maybe even Hands of Power. I also have some rando staff I picked up for 6g on AH that might be near the top third of this list.
---
Is there any other sheets I'm missing that might have been updated to include these rando enchant items? Wowhead clearly has the associated data for this, but it cannot be filtered via the search feature. The best I can think of is crossing [this reference](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/SuffixId?oldid=204430) with Mango's DB, but that's a slight bit beyond my capability.
---
As long as someone is getting the staff, I think that's fine.  But if the alternative is disenchanting it, it becomes a harder conversation.  Many warlocks dont want a staff because it removes our ability to use spellstone in PVP, which is important to our class.  If we get forced the staff, does that put us lower priority for the blade?  By all rights it probably should, but it becomes a shitty situation for the warlock.  Complicated discussion, that one.
---
??? 
---
Targetring ganking is harassing.
---
Both at streamers
---
Streamer target harassing streamer
---
Read the title lmao
---
What a horribly incorrect statement.
---
So it should be bannable to gank a streamer but the raid groups that camp every single FP, questing zone is fine?
---
No, every single person saw this kind of shit coming. Their communities and the communities that build around hating them are nothing more than a giant shit show and blizzard should not cater to their weird bullshit.
---
The addition of 1000 extra armor or whatever it was on lightbringer wasn’t what was killing these guilds my guy
---
You’re wrong 🙃
---
So? You dont have to actually stream to get your account banned.
---
If its a “can equip and use” situation, need it. If its a sale, greed it. Being salty that someone might not equip it and instead sell it is a waste of energy - who cares?
---
Again, you are trying to convince yourself of your own delusion.  Advertise has already admitted to stream sniping. It doesn't matter how he gets his info now. Hes deleted videos and a vod of him with esfands stream where he didnt realize you could hear the stream. 
---
You also miss the argument completely since asmongold was completely right in accusing him of sniping.
---
You call me a blatant fanboy and that being childish while going to extreme depths to defend advertise. I mean...common now.
---
No, people are salty because A), some servers have god aweful faction balance. 70/30 means there’s *over twice* the pop of one faction than the other, and its an even higher disparity when you consider the fact that half the smaller group is in ghost form. 
---
On top of that, while Blizz is parading about #nochanges, they changed one of the biggest pieces to the Vanilla gameplay... the population. So some people are playing on servers where, not only are they severely outnumbered, and the two factions experience major differences in how the game operates, but the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the population as a whole is 3x what it should be.
---
I posted this comment in another Rule #7 thread recently, but figured it's relevant here, too. See below.
---
We're taking more time to discuss this. I made [a comment yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e27kft/rule_7_should_be_removed/f8u8nx8/) (which I updated earlier today) indicating that we're listening, and then updating it to say we'd make a sticky for memes one day a week. We're putting that sticky idea on hold for a bit while we consider other options. I'm listing below all the options we're discussing below; let us know if there are other options that we should consider. In addition to the rules variations we're considering below, the idea of a filter system for flair could be implemented, but that would go on top of whatever we do rule-wise.
---
1. Keep everything as-is (#nochanges)
---
2. Ban all memes Tuesday thru Sunday, but allow all memes (including "low-effort") on Mondays ("Meme Mondays")
---
3. Ban all memes, all days of the week
---
4. Keep rule as-is, but make a sticky one day a week that allows all memes (including "low-effort")
---
5. Remove Rule #7 and allow all memes, all days of the week (including "low-effort")
---
Honestly, if we're gonna make a change, we want to make sure it's a good one. So, just updating people a bit here. We'll likely make a more formal post before we make any changes to get more feedback.
---
Thanks for bearing with us.
---
There use to be these 2 49 twink rogues, Yes and No were their names back in Wotlk. I wonder where they are now. Good times
---
From my viewings of his streams, I feel like he'd be pretty chill at a party when away from the 30,000 people watching. He can be measured and "normal" when not caught up in moments that I think have more to do with streaming than anything inherently wrong with him.
---
Nice on ony buff. We managed to delete the zerg on our way into mc but we didn’t have the opportunity to drop a fresh head prior to it. 
---
And ofc i went master race my dude. 
---
For khaz modan!
---
&gt; Stream sniping
---
That's the comment I replied to.
---
You’ll recognize a lot of the ED guilds then, I see them all over
---
Haven't played on private servers and still can tank easily in classic. Takes like 5-10mins of reading and you are good to go.
---
Don’t let the menthil harbor boat hit you on the way out. Sincerely, Horde players
---
Such gameplay. The best kind of PvP is the one where you don't get to have any say in your fate.
---
Yeah I've seen 2h arms warriors who tried to tank 60 lvl dungeons, but they go down very very quick.  Your can overheal them if healer geared but  it's not that easy and even then they will die a lot.  I mean I'm not here to sit and argue about it all day long but let's be real, 2h tanking is dead after lvl 50+. Only people who want to try to do interesting things are doing it, like my friend shaman who tanked strat live. Could be fun with a group of friends but usually bad experience with pugs.
---
What does a spriest do that hard counters a frost mage?
---
Yeah well, everybody is really clever *after* the damage is done, innit?
---
Dwarves are aight, I played gnome mage on northdale and looooved gnome omg
---
What's your in-game name if u don't mind me askin?
---
2H arms all day
---
I based it off my experience from vanilla.  However classic and vanilla aren't the same. That's why.
---
If you’re alliance too tbh.
---
He didn’t have an account when he made this video, Twitch can’t ban people for something they did in the past before they have anything to do with Twitch. He also wasn’t banned for streamsniping but for “harassment”.
---
Guessing you are Alli getting stomped heading the raid. We killed so Amy of you last time I almost feel bad.
---
Always immediately roll need on items like these.  There is no need to even discuss it.  Everyone needs 700+ gold.
---
Nah not a ninja, but his behavior afterwards was ninja-like
---
You know, learning the recipe would make you way more than 1000g over classic wow
---
u too
---
It really depends on the group.
---
In some groups I look like an awesome tank, I'm rock solid threat around the board, chain pulls arriving right as last batch dies, until healer needs a mana break, and we have amazing clear speed, and any threat pulled off of me never makes it out of melee range before I've got it back on me.
---
Add one eager dps, and suddenly I look like a sloppy tank,  I'm stuck making choices, save the dps or save my emergency buttons incase the healer needs it.
---
Add two eager dps and suddenly I look like a shit tank. I'm rage starved, cool downs burned on availablity, and running around like an idiot trying to gain control.
---
More combo points as sub for the energy cost, which means you get to Eviscerste them sooner.

Nope.  Enjoy stupidity tho
---
You should all have needed.
---
Mean isn't this why that person chose the name "you"
---
I've seen at least a dozen posts in this subreddit alone of this exact thing happening. It happened on Thunderfury-US a few weeks ago to the guild Windseekers.
---
With mage or 2 you don't actually tanking (we talking about trash pulls) I have mage and warrior tank
---
"We run the server, we decide when the horde gets to play."
---
If you are in a pug and a boe world epic drops you should all roll need.
---
He threw more dots.
---
Have fun on what you are turning into a PvE server. Because once you drive all the alliance away, you will basically be playing on a PvE server once we are all gone.
---
It vastly depends on the weapon. There are plenty of sims out there like the one referenced in this post that have done the math. If you don't think the sims are correct and want to use sub-optimal weapons or complain about getting out-dps'd when you think 50% of your dps needs to come from auto attacks, more power to you. Enjoy the game how you like it.
---
&gt;Nope. Enjoy stupidity tho
---
Sure looks like that's the case.
---
Need it too, seems to be down as well.
---
If you have trouble arguing then just don't do it. If you have trouble comprehending then just read it again or dont respond. Its pretty clear who i was talking about, but I think you know that and cant argue against it, which is why you resort to arguing about such a small thing.
---
why you gotta ruin everything.
---
Gutgore is not worth breaking dal'rend's.
---
Level 19 twinks will have around 1500 hit points at least, so it's not gonna be a full heal between two ticks of a SWP or whatever.
---
Some of the changes people have proposed are fine and I don't  think would bother no changes crowd, server transfers if they can somehow do it in a way that will not leave other servers with 0 alliance players or the pve realms already like 80% alliance with even more alliance, but some of the other changes that just wholesale redesign the honor system or town lay out or dungeon entry and the like are just missing the point of classic in the first place.
---
Blaming nochanges crowd is absurd though, it's not their fault the faction balance is fucked and it's not their fault blizz launched with too few servers and really that crowd and the fact blizzard at least tried to make it appear they were appeasing that crowd is really the reason why classic was so successful anyway.
---
That is a healer in healing gear and 10x more valuable than a dime a dozen warrior trying to fury tank in phase 2.
---
Streamsniping should be 100% okay and consequence free. If you don’t want to get streamsniped, maybe you shouldn’t stream.
---
Health pots health pots health pots
---
One thing not to confuse is arms warriors with prot warrior. The arms warrior's best method of keeping and holding multi target agro is by 2h and then macroing to shield as an oh shit button to help the healer. Prot warriors can keep group agro sticking with a sword and shield. Nothing is better than running a 5 man with a guilds main tank as prot spec. Makes life super easy and allows you to pull much quicker as the healer isnt drinking as often as he is with the 2h arms tank.
---
Every server is at least comparable to a full Vanilla server at this point. Even a "low" faction population is more than sufficient for everything in the game.
---
Warrior is a complicated class. Everything other people have said is probably true to some extent there’s one dominant reason:
---
Pooling rage. Good warriors start each pull with rage and use their abilities early on. Before everything is dead they stop using rage and try to get back to 100.
---
Greenman?
---
Just looked at his post history. 14yo edgelord
---
no grammar no masters
---
Stop dots. Except for you.
---
I just hopes nobody beside twinks will ever queue low level BGs. These idiots can play against each other.
---
And yes, I stand by calling them idiots. Because if they would be honest with themselves, they just want to stomp players with tremendously worse gear then themselves. They don't want to play against other twinks.
---
I just want my mageblade
---
Ya. It's just not fun anymore. Went to do some princess runs in BRD on Saturday. 23 deaths to get into BRD. 12 just to get to the entrance of the mountain thanks to all the warlocks and warriors fearing people everywhere. It's essentially ruined the game for a lot of people i know.
---
Read the Twitch TOS, you're talking out of your ass.
---
That's because Vanilla was full of 500 hp newbies joining the BGs. This won't be the case here.
---
Those are 2 completely different servers.....like what?
---
Yup, same here on bigglesworth.  Been sitting here at BRM for an hour, and have only seen 1 ally.  This is bad...
---
You know for a fact Asmongold cried to Twitch about it. He's a pathetic hypocrite
---
Question about glancing blow and weapon skill (ws):
---
Does increased ws (e.g. if I use Edgemaster's handguards) only reduce the base damage reduction? Or does it reduce the chance to occur for glancing blows as well? 
---
I'm playing a melee dps class for the first time in my wow life and I'm trying to understand how all these things work by reading, but it can still be a bit tricky to understand all of it. Thanks for helping! :)
---
This sounds a lot like heirloom gear from retail which goes against the spirit of classic
---
\#nochanges man
---
big OOF man
---
Crank that Soulja Boy
---
Thrash blade / mirah's song is a strong combo pre-raid. Dal'Rend's offhand is terrible unless paired with the mainhand. Mirah's Song is generally a decent offhand for most any mainhand.
---
If you're not human, there's no particular reason to use only swords and you may have better alternatives.
---
When I say, "I know you're doing this on purpose," what do you think is flying over my head?
---
I'm just mentioning Twitch's rules for their streamers. If people are stream sniping to mess with other streamers I kind of understand their reasoning but I wasnt trying to argue whether or not their rules make sense
---
This is a legit had em in the first half post.
---
Esk claw is pretty lol
---
All this time i thought it was The Talisman of "Binding Shard" not the "Talisman of Binding" Shard. Mind Blown. I always figured that a binding shard was used for the talisman.
---
Holy shit. How bad are you?
---
Stacks of max health pots for your level
---
New blue mainhand weapon every 5 lvls if you don't find one in a dungeon
---
Buncha cloth to powerlvl first aid
---
Good boots with minor speed increase enchant
---
Truckloads of thistle tea and elixirs
---
Lmao, imagine calling people little snowflakes and being serious about it
---
I feel you brotha, left my char at MC for the raids and am playing an alt until BG’s start up
---
&gt; An expansion that is absolute dogshit with the modern playerbase, and introduces a lot of conveniences that will change the game forever.
---
Then you say
---
&gt;Unfortunately its the most likely scenario and the nail in the coffin for classic.
---
I dont understand, is TBC dogshit or will it kill Classic?
---
Anywhere in the torch room (Lyceum is the actual in game name) will end up pulling something probably. Its quick respawning and has a lot of patrols of pretty big groups.
---
I don’t think he meant it as an indication of skill, more just to show how much he has played enhancement at max level.
---
More dots more dots
---
Youre still tanking, youre the one the mobs are attacking. Shit just dies fast because i do so much damage and the mages can unload damage without fear of agro and they also silence spell casters.
---
In some ways it is.
---
BG's will always have players and there will be action all the time, while areas like BRM/WS/Tanaris may be dead or not have enough players to keep gaining honor. 
---
But in other ways, you'll never find 100~ people in WSG like you would in BRM on raid night.
---
I just got my two eyes yesterday, just haven’t done the quest yet because I’m going to try it at 3 am when nobody will be there to harass me. Super excited, the staff with the enchant will be an extra 100 healing over my current weps, and I’m already crushing the healing as the only priest without it.
---
Jesus fucking christ, get off your high fucking horse.
---
I know my mom would kick my ass if i was saying she is disabled on the internet, any mom would i hope lol
---
Roll engineering and mining. Make dynamite. It is your best friend in AOE tanking situation. Battle stance, Charge in, Defensive stance, shout, berserking stance, WW, back to defensive stance and drop the dynamite. AOE Glue basically. Then after that you sunder the main target.
---
&gt; Yet the police will still look for the robber, and the robber will get punished by a judge if they get caught.
---
You're missing the point. The police being twitch, do have full rights banning who ever joined, it's their platform and are allowed to dictate what direction their platform goes. However, your reasoning of "obviously not the streamers fault" is what I'm trying to mock. 
---
I don't wanna start a 500 response deep argument, however streamers don't deserve special treatment. They get enough of it from their fans, and if they get some negative effects from that too, then so be it.
---
Original classic had 3 month cd paid transfers from pvp realms to pvp or pve. Pve could only go to other pve servers.  Let's do it,  can't be worse then what blizzard is already doing
---
If you can crank out a bunch of fast games, otherwise if you are stuck in an hour long turtle in WSG, it's not good.
---
a ton of mobs spawn to come watch the rend encounter, I'd guess if you aggro them they're there to stay. They don't come right away, but they file in after the 1st wave I think.
---
fitting your name is honey pot, considering you are the embodiment of panel 3 pooh.
---
I got my hands on the brute force elixir recipe for pretty cheap. 
---
What is its usage? Is it for twinks? It doesn’t stack with fort in raids so it seems pretty useless there. Pvp id rather just tip a priest 50s for a sick fort buff.
---
Once the adds are close to the tank it's inevitable that someone will hit them either with aoe or by mistake.
---
Aoe = faster fight with more mana leftover anyway.
---
Once they are in a group it's a waste to cc
---
Pretty sure I have seen a blue post saying that corpse camping is fine but if they decide to evade you and go somewhere else and you follow it becomes targeted harassment/griefing and is against the rules. So technically should be banned in WoW too.
---
Please do go on about it...
---
Not only cause I want to see that other replyer have an anyuresm trying to form a coherent sentence, but i don't like asmon, I'd love to add some reasons to that list.
---
another salty alliance player
---
dude is literally standing on my corpse
---
Then the population balanced is solved!
---
But seriously. People are going to quit regardless. There are two ways this could end:
---
1.) Keep it the way it is and the minority faction quits causing *even more* of a population imbalance.
---
2.) Introduce faction specific queues and a small amount of the majority faction quits evening out the imbalance somewhat.
---
Really though. It's completely unrelated and offtopic, doing nothing except possibly start ing a fight about something else.
---
I rolled pvp because I play a rogue and I’m not very nice
---
Ok if you say so I don't want to argue. You have your experience. Mine is different. If I unload real aoe no tank can hold it.  I'm not an idiot dps so I wait for some time.
---
it's not though
---
gryphons removed. action bars moved. system bar moved. bag bar moved. those aren't the vanilla party frames, etc...
---
My comment was more about the reason he's still living with his mom more then doubting that she has a disability. Rereading it I see how you could have confused that.
---
My point was to take things with a grain of salt when there is money involved.
---
also, you're reading into the title too much, its more about the 2 shot k thx
---
Rep will transfer with the character
---
He hasn't ganked Asmongold in over a week. 
---
Most of his streaming is just random PvP and react videos.
---
I don't think that faction balance would have to have been encouraged, but they shouldn't have made it so easy to make it so much worse.
---
From the start, when they offered free server transfers. Offer it ONLY to the faction that has &gt;60% of the population.
---
What they did now was a server change to flee queue times but it worked just as well to flee from getting ganked. So the faction that was already outnumbered were the ones to transfer away, making the imbalance much worse.
---
Have you forgotten the muffin button?
---
Fellow priest here, holy though, with a question. Do you think a reason the parses are so good for MC is potentially because the bosses are so short, and mana is less of an issue?
---
Correct. Blizzard's solution to Stream Sniping has always been to either delay your stream or don't stream your gameplay at all.
---
\^this. Also, unless you're insanely geared warlocks probably won't top DPS charts so don't be too worried about being on the top and min-maxing your heart out. In my time raiding MC I learned that there's diminishing returns to maxing spellpower at the cost of stamina and int especially in the Rag fight where you will probably die if you don't have stam, mana, and some FR. You can't do DPS when you're dead or oom-- in which case you'll be taking too much of a healer's attention from LTing too much.
---
I personally like crit because I get a kick at letting the SBs fly and seeing big #s. I'm SM/Ruin so it pairs nicely w/ Nightfall. I'm holding onto the orb too and hoping for the mageblade but it first has to drop then we have to win the roll against 8+ other caster dps. One can dream.
---
What? He has a second server I don’t know about? He probably should change it’s “asmongankers” name but there is nothing in there about actually sniping him.
---
This will definitely change Advertise's behavior though. He makes good money from streaming.
---
He will probably stay away from Asmon to avoid getting banned again.
---
I second andynator1000 those solutions are fucking stupid.
---
Just put in faction based queues and lower the pop cap to classic levels.
---
As a (noob) prot warrior myself, one of the big factors that seems to get ignored is how well the party focuses targets.
---
If everyone actually goes for skull, then x, I can usually hold aggro no problem.  As soon as the hunter starts unloading on another target, for example, I have to chase that target down which means that I can't keep building threat against the other mobs. If people keep going for skull (as expected) I might lose aggro on that mob too and then it becomes a constant battle to regain aggro of all mobs.
---
Another big problem I see is other players pulling for the tank. Initial aggro is important since all mobs that are aggrod will be focused on the puller.  As a warrior, it can be difficult to regain control of all mobs (without using challenging shout). This is especially true if the dps open up immediately after the pull.
---
I've had some awful ubrs runs despite being fairly well geared for it due to careless dps.  The worst part is, it only takes one person being careless to make it hectic.
---
&gt; Its pretty clear who i was talking about
---
No, it's not.
---
I didn't think you had a point so there isn't anything to argue about.
---
&gt; Streams it on twitch, uses asmongold's name in titles while he is doing these things on twitch. 
---
He (here you are referring to advertise) titles his stream "Killing asmon" etc and kills him on stream. That's not harassment. If he personally attacks asmon on stream and insults him, that's harassment. Wait, advertise didn't do this, asmon did.
---
&gt; His guild, they can camp people after being camped themselves. The people who are on twitch cant do anything unless they play the game.
---
Two wrongs don't make one right. Would be an argument if it would be two wrongs. Killing someone ingame isn't wrong. Using his twitch viewership to brigade someone is. (Here he/his suddenly switches to asmon).
---
&gt; No, it doesn't warrant a ban when hes responding to a guy who is trash talking him. Nor has he said anything that warrants a ban.
---
Again, two wrong doesn't make one right. And advertise didn't do any personal attack on asmon. Asmon however did. Which is clearly ToS.
---
Stop with your delusions.
---
If the raid caller/the character in question didn’t come to some sort of name change at least for vocal call related reasons, probably a badly run guild lol.
---
Why would a dominant faction leave a server they dominate? You have to allow everyone to Xfer. Soon as its open i am gone from Fairbanks in a heartbeat.
---
Eep I have been poisoned by my constituents!
---
you mean twitch was bad for like 1 server.
---
People are going to quit anyway. Period. 
---
There are two ways this who debacle can end. 
---
1.) Keep it the way it is and the minority faction quits causing even more of a population imbalance.
---
I feel called out. I'm such a fucking lazy priest.
---
If you play a melee class there is no choice.  Windfury is the blood of the horde and is absolutely irresistible.  Every alliance warrior will never know true joy ^ until tbc
---
If you swim under the window you get ported into Mc
---
Consider the human racial which gives you a leg up on horde rogues/druids. There's probably some other things to consider, but that's my first thought when I think about which race to play as a rogue. I'm definitely no professional, though, and could be wrong about it being that big of a difference. I've always seen human and undead rogues as the definite go-to for rogues. From a PvP stance, the undead racial is pretty damn broken, but most racials have their uses.
---
Obviously do more than just spam sunder but at least make sure they’re applying them in general
---
Then why would he have gotten banned for tanking asmon? You’re the one who made the thread title lmao
---
you can also do this in Shadowfang Keep. in some places you can jump off the castle wall which will take you out of the instance, and you will die to fall damage in the ravine outside of the the castle
---
Everyone seems to have a favorite bracket. I was actually partial to level 29 myself. But there’s not particularly special. Aside from if memory serves some bg’s only open up at certain levels. Like I think WSG is 10+, AB is level 20+ and AV 50+.

Not really salty.  Didn't need them myself and don't need the gold right now.  Was just wondering what etiquette was.  These are already on AH so he did it just to make a few gold.
---
Be real, youre clueless. 2h tanking 90% of lvl 60 content excluding UBRS is completely viable and significantly easier to hold threat for an Arms warrior.
---
Hunters dominate this bracket if min maxing with engineering, BUT Pendulum of doom is a 4.00 swing timer 2h axe that req level 39 to wield so any warrior, ret, or ehance can demolish with a pocket oriest or pally healer in this bracket; rogues/druids do well im every twink bracket  imo and mages are trash until mount+barrier but still can pack some heat if full bis
---
On my server, UD is 1g  and water is 15g.
---
that’s 14g a day profit. 
---
It would take 71 days for the recipe to pay for itself.
---
Not a bad deal, but...
---
You could also take that thousand gold and invest it into cheap and easy flips on the AH (pot mats midweek before raid nights, watch blue sapphires/arcane crystals for when a few warriors start advertising to have their helms crafted) and make a LOT of gold off that money.
---
I got the recipe for super cheap so I’m happy. But as an owner of the recipe (who has probably made about 1000g off of it at this point) I wouldn’t pay higher than 750g. But that’s just my opinion.
---
Sticky bandit?
---
because its so wonderfully fucking accurate
---
&gt; I'd pull a clip but you know, banned.
---
How is this relevant to seeing Asmon's ghost? That would be Asmon's perspective. If there really is a clip of that, it's out there.
---
Yeah sorry, not you, but the sentiment at large about someone “needing” a boe.
---
I far prefer the picturesque screenshots than people salt dumping about wpvp constantly.
---
Can you explain how to slowfall if you aren't a mage or priest? (The video description says all classes can use your method.)
---
They hated him for telling them the truth.
---
I'm watching 100 dead alliance running to BRD, no one is even trying fight back. Yup thats pvp alright..
---
So did he..?
---
But you and everyone else who suggested this is forgetting that there is another server on the other end of the transfer...
---
I'm on Skeram, all the alliance ran away from the horde to Heartseeker just like you said. If they only let horde transfer from the beginning then Heartseeker would just be the super horde dominated server instead of us.
---
If your going horde try a shaman, can be caster, melee dps or healer and groups want you regardless cause your a walking totem pole no matter what spec you play.
---
The Barov Peasents killed Nipsy?! The monsters!!
---
I 100% guarentee you would not pull agro and i would out DPS you while tanking. Youre not going to do more damage on a pack of 2-4 mobs than a well geared arms warrior droping sweeping strikes/whirlwind.
---
I recently switch my spec to prot warrior from Arms. Now that I don't have Sweeping strike for WW, I'm having a bit more trouble holding AoE threats.
---
Any advice on rotation?
---
&gt; Hes deleted videos and a vod of him with esfands stream where he didnt realize you could hear the stream. 
---
Link?
---
And don't get me wrong. I don't like advertise. I just like asmongold even less.
---
We'll never know
---
I wrote that I knew this wasn't viable and I'm genuinely interested to know if there is anyway to tryhard this way.
---
Alright alright looks like we have nothing to talk about.
---
&gt;Generic complaint that is caused by too many players.
---
Transfer servers exist
---
&gt;Why should I have to transfer?  It's the other people that are the problem
---
Rinse and repeat 100 times a day
---
It would still be proportional. 
---
You'd still be at a disadvantage.
---
Well if you ever hit level cap and stop being a green wearing scrub you might one day see the end of Molten Core, then you shall finally understand.
---
agree not good due to the 5 kill limit
---
Ah fuck I get punted sometimes and now I see its not just bad luck.. wtb new GUID
---
I can't even find groups anymore on Mograinne alliance. People are raid logging that's it, 5 mans are not worth it anymore
---
If you're more into PVP go gnome, for PVE go human. This is only recommended though if you really don't care what your character looks like because they give very small advantages. If it's your first time playing and you really want to be immersed in the game i'd recommend just picking the race that you like the most.
---
I'm an Orc Warrior en route to 60, currently just about lvl 53, and I was going to aim for Rivenspike MH + Boneslicing Hatchet as OH. At least until I can afford Fury Axe. I also got lucky and got Edgemasters. Would there be any better combination I'm missing, or is that solid?
---
\#AFewChanges Needed bartender \^\^
---
Specifically for enhancement, a lot of the guides out there are not entirely accurate.  Lots advocate for a 0/30/21 spec which is simply not necessary at this point in the game.  Some of the BIS guides also have items that are not the BIS at this point because of the DM release.
---
Being on super dominant faction probably gets boring quick. Only way to get honor is to try to compete for tags like some fuckin rarespawn or roam around obscure areas hoping to find someone to just goon
---
I'm not able to tell anyone how to assign loot. Someone could take info like this and could probably find ways to argue that any given sword or dagger is better going to a warrior or to a rogue. If having the information at hand for how certain items perform on warriors helps make that decision, the guild leadership can use that info and take it from there.
---
From the perspective of a raider, you may be able to figure out which items have less competition but perform relatively well on a warrior. For example, a non-human alliance player could snag a Deathbringer and use a Flurry Axe offhand with Edgemaster's. A non-orc horde player could try to go for a Brutality Blade or might see that the Obsidian Edged Blade or Bonereaver's Edge is being underrated. Humans and orcs are usually best off trying to get priority on the swords and axes, respectively, to avoid gimping their glove slot. Rogues themselves might find the loot competition for swords makes them consider going daggers, and a dagger offhand (like core hound tooth) with aged core leather gloves is not a bad option for a warrior either. On every non-human warrior, the flurry axe is a very good BOE item that can turn the search for two raid weapons into a search for one mainhand weapon, easing the loot competition for the guild and for the individual player.

By vanilla UI I think he means a busy mess with crap covering the whole screen.

Why? I don't follow twitch drama and I don't really spend time watching others play unless it's a tutorial. I'm a software dev at twitch's parent company. Not sure why this makes me dumb for asking a question lmfao
---
eh, I think I got enough responses with people showing that targeting streamers is actually against Twitch's ToS.
---
Maybe you're the dummy?
---
They're probably going to review everything after BGs drop, and if subs are down, then they'll implement PAID server and faction transfers. Gotta find a way to make $$$ off their mistakes.
---
Trinket if you're Orc or Stoneform if you're dwarf. If you're losing to a rogue most of the time as a pvp spec warrior you're bad.
---
At least towards the end I recall a shit load of theory crafting happening on the class forums, but then how many people logged onto the forums regularly to read that?
---
I did it with fear and seduce, that's two CC's.  Really useful.
---
not in the first few weeks
---
How do you know? Do you start a survey after each run?

lmao

I feel your pain, the horde on Fairbanks have daddy issues too.

If a warlock is second-to-top dps, it means that your mages, rogues, and warriors are slacking. Full stop. That's not an accolade for you, it's a condemnation of your guild.
---
And, once again, this post wasn't even about raiding. It was about dungeon groups. It's amusing that you complain (erroneously) about strawmen while shifting goalposts yourself.
---
You seem to have your head on straight when it comes to things like gender issues and politics. Maybe one day you'll take that empathy and apply it here, as well. Pick up First Aid, and be a boon to the human beings in your dungeon group, rather than a hindrance.
---
World RP is mainly based on places, events, groups or guilds. You are free to roam and do whatever you want but there are times when people just try to have fun an RP with you.
---
If you enjoy the sociable parts of wow RP servers are a great place to go. You don't really have to stay in character at all but you can if you want to and it's fun. You also have fun random encounters with enemy players ending in you not fighting and doing something together even though the language barrier makes it harder.
---
You will find people RPing in random places and most people love it if you join in and have fun!
---
Literally every video on Advertise channel has Asmons name in the title, or his guilds. MAYBE there’s one or two that have Esfans name instead. He was just griefing at that point.
---
He's horde on 60:40 or worse I guarantee it.
---
It's quite clearly implicated that he won't be playing the same MMO than us :(
---
The servers are lagging 😂
---
And yes a 15 year old game should work in 2019 🥱
---
Never seen any assholes flame someone yet, I have seen a couple who just melted down over losing loot rolls though and I've had one person who didn't get rude but just flat out ignored any advice or guidance in which way we needed to go which kept causing wipes. Overall community has been good.
---
My phones autocorrect puts an apostrophe before every s at the end of a word and spells yesterday wrong every single time. It feels Ike the technology is going backwards.
---
Hunters have clear pvp and pve specs too.  A lot of the trapping and deep survival talents are not raid viable until late Naxx gearing.  Yet a 0/21/30 build is a nightmare to face in PvP.  Not to mention that BM hunters are almost excluded from raids in MC due to the high level of AoE and extra damage that happens due to another body.
---
Lol no sometimes that's the only way you are gonna be able to keep threat with a trigger happy squad.  You can mix in revenge procs.
---
No armor, no weapons, never upgrade skills
---
These suggestions are fucking stupid.  
---
Create balance with exp boost? Do you even have a level 60? Most of us don't give a shit about experience. Fucking dummy idea.  
---
Your layer suggestion is probably the absolute worst though. 1:1 means you can't ever form a group to attack a town or do anything you would in a war. Additionally, "leftovers are on their own phase"? So if you don't get into the primary phase, fuck your honor? Ranks are compared to other people on your faction. To do that would be to give a huge unfair advantage to a select few. Not to mentiom the potential to exploit it. 40 alliance in the zone, counted with my other account? Cool, make a 40 man group and lock it out from the rest of your faction so only your guild gets honor.  
---
Your ideas are fucking terrible. Like the suggestions a 12 year old who does not grasp the game mechanics or endgame at all might make. Just... no. In fact, delete your toon and play a different game. You should legitimately be embarrassed by these "ideas".
---
DPS and totem twisting is my raiding priority, usually off heals for a melee DPS on Shazz.  If you're healing consistently as enhance, you're doing it wrong.  You arent there for heals, you are there to provide twisting and DPS.
---
Then you would do Faction with the most players are allowed to transfer to X realm lacking that faction's player.
---
No it's perfect, absolute masterpiece
---
Look, just one thing. The problem is that you make it seem like streaming is somehow a glorious golden privilege which naturally offsets all negative aspects of publicly broadcasting your position. That's just wrong. It doesn't. There are plenty of streamers who outright refuse to get special treatment from their fanbase. And they still get stream sniped and ganked repeatedly simply because some asshole thinks it's funny. 
---
Streaming is a job. And being a successful streamer is not just all fun and games, it takes a lot of hard work. It's not just sitting in front of the camera and playing games. You have to be entertaining, you have to be "on" every. single. day. Just like any other job. I don't understand why so many people like you defend this kind of behaviour. If a coworker jumped on your desk and pissed in your morning coffee, would you defend them by telling yourself "well, I get to sit inside a nice office, so I'll just have to deal with it". wtf is that line of thinking?!
---
Depends on what you mean by harassment. Is killing someone in a game harassment? Is it watching and commenting on someones videos/clips? Analysing someones gameplay? Pionting out hypocrisy? Im my opinion its not.
---
Having other people tell him that stuff, then acting on it, still counts as "exploiting another broadcaster's live broadcast" even if he's not directly watching the stream.
---
I actually was around then. But it was vastly different. Yes World PvP was glorious but people didn't know about anything (even if they were good at PvP) there were epic battles tanking everything. There was no constant death squads. You could fonpvp in stv or hilsbrad but you could also land at rhodium point without beeing corpse camped. 
---
I mean on my server it's actually alliance most of the time killing everybody (besides census saying we are vastly horde dominated) but yeah. PvP is fun PvP is fine. Server imbalance is not and it's only blizzards fault.
---
Complaining aside I am just loving that I can play classic and couldn't be happier
---
Ditto scholo where herald appears.  Iirc his knockback can actually throw you out of the instance.
---
OP is a baddy. 
---
Those ghosts are literally the only threatening thing about the entire pack. They have an aoe silence and an almost unavoidable mana burn. 30 yards range + the time it takes for the pack to acknowledge they're being under attack is more then enough time for any competent tank to pick up the mobs
---
"Being better than a bad player does not make you a good player" -Faker
---
Nice strawman there mate.
---
People are welcome to move servers. I mean Blizzard fucked up with making the pop caps the same as the private servers. Fees and XP changes fuck with the game as fundamentally as the kinda pvp problems we're seeing, you're saying lets throw the game design down the tube for reasons that won't change the population.
---
Do you really think that lvl 60's give a shit about rested XP. AH fees don't matter... until they do and then you've ruined the economy on a server.
---
Your ideas are still fucking stupid and your ideas should never be implemented. You're one of the worst sofa-ridden game designers I've seen on this subreddit and by god there's a lot.
---
&gt; Who im talking about is separated...**IF** the context from the rest of the sentences makes it very clear.
---
Fixxed that for you.
---
&gt; Asmon didnt use his twitch viewers to harass anyone. He was retaliating with guild mates.
---
You sure you want to go with that? Really? For realsies?
---
That is for retail only, no?
---
Lvl to 60 only killing boars.
---
Go ironman challenge on pvp server as solo warrior
---
I havent seen any and I am levelling my 2nd character. I guess we will see when BGs come out as thats when they will really want to be using them.
---
But the facts are, Glider and HB got shut down and their owners sued. If you want to create a commercial bot you are guaranteed a lawsuit against a deep pockets game developer, really not worth it so sure some people know how to code and can write some sort of shitty bot which will likely fail Blizz's security and get banned. There may be a handful of guys smart enough to actually write a good bot, is it worth the effort if you cannot sell it?
---
I just dont see how bots will be huge in classic but I havent played retail in many years, I dont know if people are still botting a lot there.
---
He was right though, you're fucking stupid if you think any of those even comes close to an okay idea let alone a good one.
---
And then watch it tick to 0 while your squad drinks..
---
Having people tell you where he is and then listening to it to gank him is literally "exploiting another broadcaster's live boardcast in order to harass them in-game"
---
Its usually not the tank but the dps that decide how clean it will go.  If dps gives the tank just 2 seconds he'll have zerker rage up and build a ton of rage really fast to build threat on everything... as long as they are all hitting the tank. 
---
 Scenario two, another dps warrior charges in right after the tank and immediately hits whirlwind.  The tank won't have sufficient aggro on all the extra targets so the second warrior takes the aggro.   Now the tank didn't get to build his rage with zerker rage because he wasn't getting hit due to meter chasing dps warrior (meter chasing warrior looks good here because he stole all the rage that the tank should have had and is using it to dps harder).  Now the tank rage starved can't just pass dps warrior in threat, he must taunt one at a time and try to do some extra threat after taunt to hold before moving to next one to taunt.  The same can happen with a mage or warlock but they will generally kite the mobs so at least no one is getting hit if the tank isn't but it causes the same problem for the tank if they start early.  No rage trying to pull back 4 mobs and has to do it one at a time.
---
Some of this still falls on the tank, he can be good or bad, slow to react or uses wrong skills or whatever.  Dps have the power to make runs super easy but most people are about the meters or just speed in general so you'll see those sloppy pulls all over the place.  Just don't always blame the tank for being bad, look at what happens at the start of each pull before you judge.  If dps has aggro within the first four seconds of a pull it is their fault and the tank can't do much about that except challenging shout once every 10 min.
---
It’s got degrees for me. Did you engage me when I was 100% hp and mana and no creatures on me and I win? I salute them and move on. Did they engage me while I’m fighting a mob and at half health and I still win? I’m camping them until they don’t give me honor.
---
PvE server once they open up paid xfers.
---
I'm mostly a solo-leveller but I quite like running dungeons as well, is Shadow Priest viable for healing in dungeons or should I switch to Holy?
---
&gt;Then you have to worry about patrols and other fuckery while low on mana.
---
The only reason you'd be low on mana is because you didn't CC nor kill the ghost in time to begin with
---
With the minority faction
---
That's because no one thought they were gonna fuck it up this bad. \*Almost\* no one.
---
So most of you guys are pvp specced, I have a friend that doesn’t respec to silithus farm but runs into one v ones all the time, any similar combos for combat dagger/sword without hemorrhage?
---
can you link the FS/CoC build?
---
Finally an alliance that admits both sides have morons on it. The fanboyism the alliance generally shows is fucking unreal.

You can't complete thunderfury until later phases of content though (BWL?)

I had a tank ask me to shackle "when you see my bow animation".  This was my 2nd strath run in classic and it sounded like advice from someone who had done it before, but after the 3rd pull I realized my shackle was hitting before his arrow.  After that I just timed the shackle for immediately after his arrow hit and then there were no probs.

---
So would playing in a hunters deadzone be considered unsportsmanlike?
---
Was the biggest issue I had back in vanilla as a rogue.  PvP was meh while topping charts in PvE.  Never had enough gold to constantly swap specs back and forth.
---
This does fall apart for some specs though as they are very easily pvp and raid viable with minor tweaks.
---
I have a 19 rogue twink lol, just saying they're not OP, Compared to other twinks.

Isn't the record something like 4 days?

So he played one more day and got tons of BiS and trained all his professions? Pretty impressive.

&gt;Bandages don't have a level requirement

&gt;225 is the level you need to use (not create) heavy runecloth
---
Advertise was actually surprisingly nice towards Asmon on stream, believe it or not. Might have been critical of his guild leading methods and whatnot, but never insulted him as a person and would ask chat not to do that either. His youtube videos have always been related to Asmon's and his guild's in-game activities too, it never was about harassing him.
---
Then you could contrast that with Asmon's personal insults towards Advertise, there's plenty of quotes out there. McConnell always had a good approach to this, he saw it as content, saying that Advertise's shenanigans made things interesting.
---
Not. 14 years of people meta gaming classic and minmaxing it like they didn’t back in the day ruined classic.
---
You can want nochanges Vanilla and nochanges TBC, because they’re seperate games. If you were to combine everything good about Vanilla and BC, you would have one shit game instead of two awesome ones.
---
I think it just happens more often because some items may be an upgrade for a bunch of classes even if the primary stats are only suitable and a bigger upgrade for one person. Like some rings will drop while my rogue has an empty ring slot\\shitty green old ring that might be main stat int with an offstat of stam. That stam is usable but a caster is far better off with it.
---
A pug will never beat twin emps.
---
Same with nefs tail swip in BWL.
---
Not from an Alliance!
---
From the top of my head just make the other faction "full" when the balance is at tipping point, when the other faction reaches say 55% you wouldn't be able to create new characters on that side before the other catches up.
---
no hearthing
---
He wasn't banned for ganking. He was banned for harassment on Twitch and being a fucking leech. If it was anyone other than Asmon, your favorite dude to shit on, you'd think it was some toxic shit too. Advertise broke Twitch ToS, what exactly is surprising about that? Glad I won't see his Asmon hate clickbait titles for a week. TOP 10 ways to tank ASMONGOLD, #8 will SHOCK you! Cringe af
---
Yep!
---
That has NOTHING to do with the age of the game. Literally nothing.
---
Everyone wants to stomp players with worse gear than themselves. Why do you think it's so hard to level on pvp servers right now?
---
Insulting isn’t harassing. Harassment is a continuous thing. Like say, if one video has someone else name in the title and you shit on them? That’s insulting. If EVERY ONE of your videos is dedicated to one person? That’s harassment
---
yuuuup. Just got my warlock (which is a ton of fun - never played one in vanilla) to hillsbrad. Mistakes were made.
---
Kick people who don't disable the default combat log imo.
---
Mind flay will not remove anything, but ok.
---
It's not even close.  BGs are top place to get honor
---
Your math is wrong because you aren't factoring the honor you get from BG kills
---
&gt;Ubergryph 
---
in german, that would be 'Übergriff', which means assault.
---
somewhat suitable, i guess.
---
That's how we treat these honorless targets.
---
You can absolutely heal as Shadow while leveling.
---
Shadow priest is just fine for dungeons.

Last image needs more stink lines
---
Bindings never dropped until patch 1.6, as Thunderfury came out with BWL.  I have no idea why blizzard is allowing bindings to drop pre-BWL, but it wasn't originally designed and added until then.
---
Thrash blade is a great mainhand. The reason that it's so great is that its proc scales so well with all your other gear, whereas weapon DPS does not scale to become more valuable if you have more attack power on other gear. The extra swing proc also generates more rage, which is another reason why the weapon is so good for a warrior despite being lackluster otherwise. Your attack power (and crit) boosts how hard the extra swing hits, while also boosting how much damage per rage you get from using abilities. It's also relatively slow, which is good.
---
Thrash Blade is your best mainhand with those options. Mirah's Song is the best of those options as an offhand. Edgemaster's will significantly increase DPS on raid bosses.
---
Go look at the titles of his videos on his channel.
---
PvP servers in vanilla were absolutely nothing like this.  You might run into a group getting to a dungeon form time to time and fight it out.  World bosses were interesting, but generally if you avoided EPL and Arathi highlands (on my server at least) you could pretty much do whatever you wanted, whenever, and run into very little PvP outside of 1v1s and small scale group PvP.  
---
With the massively increased server populations every zone has multiple roving gank squads from both factions.  You literally cannot escape PvP on a PvP server in Classic, where you absolutely could in vanilla.  That isn't even mentioning that massively increased level of tryhards using full engineering trinkets and consumables, as well as FAPs on CD.  
---
This is not the vanilla experience, not even close.  
---
We saw the evolution of World PvP on private servers where the pot and engineering tryharding really stepped up a notch, but generally those servers were much lower population.  
---
I enjoy PvP, loved playing on a PvP server in vanilla, but had blizzard told us before hand that servers were going to be 5-10x as large as they were back then I would have been far less likely to roll on one for classic.  But it was never communicated that they were going to make these mega servers that has completely ruined the PvP experience.
---
When taking damage battle stance gives most stuff, but you do wanna swap to beserker for whirlwind and berserker rage. At maxed you often don't care about your damage taken so you can sit in berseker just fine.
---
Health Potions, Food, Thistle Tea / Swiftthistle, Poisons/Poison Mats (Need poison profession to make poisons), Blind/Vanish powder
---
What I would do is mail a bunch of these to the alt so I could restock at mailboxes as they'll sit for up to a month.
---
I second (third?) the posters above me, your suggestions are unnecessarily complicated and, well stupid
---
How is it different for Alliance right now?
---
Sure, they can log in, but then they can't do anything for an hour because of the roaming gank squads, then they log out.
---
I hope so! DM is a huge area to get camped 😀
---
I do not believe that Advertise has made partner status yet. That’s the difference. 
---
Like it or not, Twitch is going to bend over backwards to satisfy whatever their largest partner desires...
---
Just the damage reduction.
---
NICE! :D
---
I don't see or hear any streamsniping at that time stamp.
---
Again. What "extrem depths" am I going? Specify it. Because I'm sitting here and writing a comment? That's "extrem" to you?
---
People still think that everyting is viable since it's classic. That will change in bwl and unward.
---
Im pretty sure this is the version of the game you need the most min-maxing in raids.
---
yea, ill be going dalrens in PVE but gutgore is better in pvp with the higher dps and chance to proc i think, hopefully get brutality soon.
---
There was a SL lock in my guild who made this claim, challenged anyone to try for 100g.
---
I tried 3 times. He owes me 300g.
---
Better than some un developed sperg 16 year olds posting pictures of the same thing over and over and over again fishing for anyone in the world to show them attention in the form of digital upvotes that have absolutely zero weight in any part of life for anyone ever. Imagine the insecurity you must have. Lol. 
---
A dad implies they have real obligations in life and not only worried why their pimples won’t go away or little Becky next door doesn’t wanna play with you anymore but always with your BFF Big John. So if a dad earns themself a mount in a video game then it’s just as important as your laughable childish ambitions/accomplishments like owning every skin in Fortnite cuz your moms credit card was still linked to your Xbox 360. 
---
TL;DR - Spergs = Meme Obsessive, GZ on the mount dad.
---
Usually no because their pets are so stupidly tanky you can't kill him that fast, and the damage you take from killing them while they hit you is about the same you take when killing the hunter/warlock. Sap versus shamans to remove their totems is usually nice tho.
---
To me it's a step down the path of players losing their identity again. Yeah it's annoying not being able to just easily switch spec sometimes but it's also going to bother me if classes are able to just do every spec again.
---
Oh I see.  Well, rolling could give it to the new guy, yeah.  That's a fairly rare system for guilds right now though.  Some guilds will do trial periods where they can only roll on tier gear too, for example.
---
Like say, insulting and badmouthing someone again and again. Using his large viewerbase to harass said target. Ring a bell?
---
Don't transfer unless you are horde. You make your serveur and your destination serveur worst. 2 birds 1 stone
---
Ironic.
---
To be fair, I've seen horde AND alliance players who are like that.
---
Have won 100% of mz duells vs rouges as pala
---
I absolutely dig this stuff. 
---
Big boi Asmon being brought down by a single nobody, and had to resort to Twitch to save his ass. 
---
At this point, I do hope that Classic is ruined for Asmon. God knows how many people’s experience he has ruined.
---
Wish reddit removes emotes
---
For the alliance btw 🤣👌🔥🤣🤣🤣
---
What an absolute tilter
---
I'm having a hard time. Can you describe it for me?
---
Cause horde on sulfuras are too busy camping flightpaths &gt;.&lt;  never took the time to learn their roles
---
Absolute best situation is when they are incapitated. Gouge deathray as a rogue is super strong combo.
---
The changelog for 10/22/19 on the spreadsheet says that heroic strike reduces miss chance for OH, so it seems to take it into account somewhat. However, I don't believe that it accounts for queueing and cancelling heroic strike.
---
This is probably part of why it seems to overvalue hit chance (over 6%). I've generally used gear setups with exactly 6% hit if it's possible to drop hit for other stats.
---
My only question is do they have proof of him stream sniping? If so shame on him, if not seems kinda shitty to go off one streamer's whines.
---
All horde are mouth breathing neckbeards but Fairbanks is the worst of the worst neckbeards
---
Apparently, bragging.
---
Why is mirahs a better OH than bone slicing hatchet?
---
I want to go back to the park I had fun at as a kid, it had 2 slides a swing and a sandbox and there was usually about 10 people there.
---
Ok cool so there's 400 of you guys so here's 2 playgrounds and we're going to let 40 of you play at a time, o shit you aren't able to play on the stuff cus too many people... Oh shit that's only 80 people out of the 400 what a long line.. ok here's 1 more park for 40 more people, if you don't like the over crowding at the first one u can switch.   Oh shit everything is still packed and there's still 280 people that are in line, let's add 1 more playground... Repeat, repeat repeat
---
Hey guys if you don't like waiting leave your friends behind and go to a different playground.
---
Players:. How come playgrounds 5 and 6 only have people that want to slide, and 7 and 8 only have people playing in the sandbox,. Blizzard can u help us to guide people to the right place?
---
Fanboys: you all wanted to play on the playground like u did when u were little this is what u wanted so u shouldn't complain 
---
Normal players:. What no... We do want to play... Like we did back in the day with our 10 friends.
---
Fanboys: you all wanted to play on the playground like u did when u were little this is what u wanted so u shouldn't complain.
---
Players:...wut... No that's not what we're saying
---
Fanboys:. You all wanted to play on the playground like u did when u were little this is what u wanted so u shouldn't complain.

I was in the discord previously so I don’t know if you’re willfully being ignorant or just trolling.
---
Pservers significantly buffed armor and hp of bosses to increase their difficulty.  For example, Pserver Ragnaros had 5600 armor, while Classic Ragnaros has only 3700.
---
Our guild does a silent auction for the bags. I lost 2 weeks in a row by one gold.
---
I'm not blaming Blizzard for more people choosing horde.  I don't think it's Blizzards fault beyond the blunder of allowing the mass exodus of alliance off certain servers which created an even bigger imbalance.  Blizzard doesn't get to choose which faction you play.  We created this problem but it's best we attempt to fix it before it gets worse don't you think?
---
I was going to say "Not from Jed, aye!" but figured if ya didn't recognize Rag you probably wouldn't get a Jed joke.
---
It's a great option for an orc, no denying it.
---
Twitch has been bad for a lot of things, because asshats will emulate the behavior of their e-idols regardless of where they are.
---
&gt;I dont understand, is TBC dogshit or will it kill Classic?
---
Both, and I also think TBC is a much different game than vanilla. You get a tiny continent and thats where everyone will be spending their time, and that trend starts in TBC and is still in place on retail today.
---
No more huge open world with lots of conveniences.
---
what's this interface? Is this an addon?
---
Starting a duel in deadzone sure
---
Totally agree, I’m honestly amazed anyone thinks being like r/2007scape is a bad thing. Sub is fantastic
---
I do see your point but as a priest healer I never use greater heal in raids
---
What's the problem with keep using the xbox controller for WoW? I think you can map the keys just fine with Joy2Key for instance. You can do the same with Nintendo's Switch controller using the JoyCon Analog driver. Other than that there's the wireless gaming keys for FPS users, plenty available.
---
If you're looking for a specific solution built for exactly the issue your partner's having, you can try [Azeron's controller.](https://www.azeron.eu/) This one's designed specifically to be used by people who have wrist movement issues or injuries. But they come with a cost. Might worth checking if that's what you're looking for.
---
I see your Voldeshort, and raise you my, so far only lv 7, Voldemorc.
---
Meanwhile there’s like 17 people in IF at peak times lol. 
---
Alliance on Stalaag has become nonexistent. There is no wpvp just roaming horde raids farming honor.
---
Im combat daggers (raid specced). But with my trusty thistle tea i can kill most people pretty quick.
---
Cheap shot -&gt; backstab -&gt; thistle tea -&gt; backstab 2x -&gt; eviscerate. If theyre tanky af kidney shot is probably better than evi.
---
Also yes tea is expensive but i farm that shit so idc
---
In my experience people who defend mediocrenedd like watching their wives/girlfriends get banged by other guys
---
The quest is not available until p3, so you still can't craft them now.
---
That will only bring back a fraction of the subs they lost.
---
Agree.  The game is unplayable right now on pvp servers.  My guild only logs in for raids and doesn't bother any other time.
---
Is tfury ever replaced?
---
cringy posts like this shouldve just be banned tbh
---
This is true. 2h tanking is actually way better than tanking with a sword n board... some bosses excluded. 
---
Ofc you switch to shield when need be, but whirlwind with a 2h and sweeping strikes in d stance is amazing threat.
---
However, as a warrior that has run strat live like 15 times, emp 12 times and full cleared MC 3 times I still don’t have a better 2h than theredras’ scepter, so I’m still fury. Shouldn’t have sold vendorstrike.
---
How do we know that release is upon us soon? Did I miss that?
---
Finding instance groups.
---
That definitely is a factor right now. Our guild is clearing them very fast so i dont have to conserve any mana throughout the fight and just blow my load. As new raids come out it may be harder to play the mana game and dps may suffer. But at the same time we will have better gear, so we will have to see how it plays out.
---
I put an asterisk by three weapons that are understandably difficult to obtain (R14, world bosses, and TF).
---
It's still possible to obtain them, and they can be simmed, regardless of the fact that it's better on a tank.
---
Getting to 308 weapon skill is huge because it puts you at the glancing blow cap. I'm a rogue with PB mh and DD is better than CHT for me until I get the +5 dagger gloves (I already have +5 from a talent as well). Even after the dagger gloves, CHT is only a 6 dps increase.
---
Every 5 minutes you're a killing machine for anyone stupid enough to stand toe to toe with you without sinking you and killing you. Honestly combat swords just feels like trash to pvp with. Not to mention other level 60s can see you from like 25 years away in stealth; that super slow, long ass cd stealth. I just spec hemo until mc night and then go back to hemo. Hemo ony since it's 20 man slow dps strat anyway. The double vanish probably lets me do MORE damage on ony than if I were combat swords tbh.
---
A sp is “worth” at 4+ locks, provided the locks do acceptable damage over the fight and the fight is less than 240 second long. 
---
This is because Shadow Weaving will provide another 60% worth of a lock’s damage done during the fight on it’s own (from the 4 locks each doing 15% more damage), and as long as the priest can equal half a lock’s worth of damage that is profit. It is easily possible to extend your mana pool to 4 minutes with proper use of consumables. If you can, you are providing more total damage done to the group than a fifth lock. 
---
All that being said, it requires your raid to be organized enough to properly manage debuff slots, and assumes your sp and locks are bringing buffs and consumables, and are getting good uptime. Hilariously, the more likely a group is to get a benefit from a sp the less likely they are to actually need that benefit.
---
Jar Jar?
---
Nice try, but you’re not DPSing
---
what?
---
whose piss is he taking?
---
why would someone take piss?
---
such an odd thing to say
---
Amy?
---
You all keep saying that, I'm wondering if its because you forgot how the AQ event works and that BG queues will have battle groups like vanilla
---
I'm interested to see how much value this thing will actually have 
---
Since transmogs aren't a thing and you'll actually have to equip it for anyone to see it, will there be much interest?
---
With server sizes the way they are, are you really going to spot the random guy with Teebu's among the 65 other AFK people standing around in front of the bank?
---
Generally all items like this are shared cd - but sometimes they miss stuff /shrug
---
I can't seem to find a class that I find fun to play throughout the whole leveling phase.
---
So far, I have:
---
* 28 Paladin
---
* 21 Rogue
---
* 16 Warrior (so far, the funnest but had an unfortunate vendor mishap that couldn't be fixed..)
---
* 11 Hunter
---
Strongly considering just restarting the Warrior because said vendor incident involved my gear I was using (was trying on other stuff for looks, lol) so I am severely gimped now on him.
---
Yeah, I've charged in and had dps rip aggro before I can even get an auto or second ability off. At that point, it's not bad tanking. There's literally nothing you can do given the gcd.
---
Even better is when dps pull before you even charge/range pull, like when you're waiting for the healer to drink.
---
Also, I'd throw BShout in there. It's better than demo shout at generating threat. By itself, it won't keep threat on a mob that your dps are plowing into, but if people are focusing targets properly, it'll buy you a couple seconds while you're tab/sundering all the mobs. Just keep in mind that it scales off the players it affects (and despite some misconceptions I've seen posted, will generate threat if it refreshes the duration), so make sure your party is in combat/in range before you use it.
---
Idk man a lot of the shit talkers who think they are hot shit for 10 v 1ing people all day on my server discord look like wanna be gang bangers, not neckbeards lol.
---
How much is it going for?
---
You'll lose your ninja reputation
---
you think they're permanent? HA
---
&gt; clout chase
---
I mean... you can make content about shitting on others. Look at heavyweight "professional wrestling" FFS.
---
Assmon, Twitch, and Advertisement should all be leaning into this and crafting a story around the "rivalry", because it's likely mostly bullshit anyway.
---
Nice gear, need a couple head and leg enchants.  Do you find spiritshroud legs to be better than skyshroud legs? I also drop the eye of beast trinket for mindtap or talisman of emph power.
---
If you don't want to get stream sniped don't fucking stream.
---
I’m in this discord rn and there is nothing about sniping asmon in there.
---
You got outplayed obviously.
---
Horde (ideally) gets WF on their mh.
---
Some of them, particularly the 39s, prefer no mounts in BGs too.
---
If pace is somewhat important as you imply in your post then having 4 enh shaman in your raid is obviously not ideal and they should be replaced with better dps assuming the healer spots are taken although having a few shaman healers is nice. Really only room for 1 meme spec from each class.
---
No way to tell at this point
---
He's not understanding the problem.  If the ratio got down to 10,000:100 H:A, he would say 'just let the 100 alliance quit, it's fewer people'.
---
Realistically, it’s not like the 20th century where a couple million can set someone up for life. 
---
All Asmon has is WoW. He’s tried streaming other games, but has failed each and every time. No sponsor will touch him with a 10 foot pole due to his easily demonstrable toxicity. 
---
He better hire some good people to invest what he has, because I don’t see how he can pivot once streaming WoW is over. 
---
*Obligatory disclaimer: I watch Asmon weekly. It’s entertainment. I am not shitting on him, I am not jealous. I want him to succeed.*
---
Yeah but it's not too bad.  If you're in an insane guild you can get away with just using T3 chest and shoulders.  If you look those up, they have decent offensive stats.  Then, you can use a bunch of t2.5 which has pretty high threat.
---
Don't base damage intake off of MC, remember, we are using the 1.12 version of preraid and MC gear which is almost as strong or stronger in many cases than BWL gear.  Every tier of content hits a lot harder than the previous tier.
---
 Dont bother, nothing will be done, blizzard apologists will keep sucking on blizz dong because they gave us classic and "listened" lol.
---
dec 12th
---
But no, as it is now it means people who spec prot to tank have an advantage over the people trying to do a bit of everything. Which still adds to the whole class identity thing people like.
---
If someone tapes $100 bills to their forehead and walks around a ghetto alone with a sign that says "I am carrying large amounts of cash"  then I would attribute the majority of the blame to that person.
---
I'm pretty sure they did mention that before. 
---
Besides there was always a lot of ganking. The reality of pvp servers and classic was it funneled you into areas you literally couldn't avoid. STV was always hell. Was then, was now. The biggest difference really is if you played horde during vanilla on a pvp server you rarely encountered alliance. They were always a rarity on pvp servers. 
---
As for the pots and engineering tryhard is why I stopped playing Classic and why I think most will end up doing it too. The try hards have ruined Classic by bringing the biggest thing that makes retail a failure. The community mentality is toxic. They brought the toxic mentality with them.
---
Can't prove streamsniping. It's very easy to find anyone in the game, make an opposite faction character and do "/who nickname". Even easier when they're popular and everyone on the server knows you are the go-to guy when it comes to ganking them. Or you can take advantage of the fact that Asmon invites hundreds of random spergs into his guilds, very easy to get moles in there and know everything they're doing.
---
Same on my server. Kromcrush was the most balanced large PvP server back when the wowhead census was posted. Now alliance are completely overrun because of the free transfers. I've only gained 3 levels in the last two weeks because of ganking.
---
Spy Will find you....
---
We already knew that Asmongold was a little bitch. This just cements the matter.
---
Good thing Asmotrash is leaving to go play retail
---
No because harassment is an arbitrary definition and as far as I can tell all the activity happened within the game.
---
So no, I really don't see the issue at all.
---
Bloodthirst should be your third highest damage tho lmao. Most of your damage comes from auto attacks and Heroic strike.
---
Bing search her patron page content. Idk why she doesn't just go to adult camming, she already does it on the side
---
Almost everything, except Naxx probably.
---
The thing is, things are different now than it was back in Vanilla. A lot of people knows exactly what they're doing, what's required and what to do. So even in the case of many newer players who's in it for the first time, there are plenty who knows exactly what they're doing, and most of raid leaders even in PUGs includes these people.
---
Jesus christ, get over yourself.
---
"Grown men" can do whatever the fuck they want, and generally aren't so immature that they need to tell other people what's acceptable fun.
---
Vanilla as in the UI people used in 2004-2006, not vanilla as in the *basic* UI.
---
Yikes. Not a good look.
---
&gt; If you were to combine everything good about Vanilla and BC, you would have one shit game instead of two awesome ones.
---
I don't think so tbh. TBC do have some improvements, for instance the overall PvE progression structure. Class design is slightly improved (at least it tackles some of the biggest issues that plagues vanilla), professions are progressed and improved upon (For instance tailoring specilizations are added which aren't in vanilla). There are some new cool class spells. Some of the new zones are great.
---
Like, if they added the best elements of TBC to vanilla in some OSRS style I would find that much more interesting than a \#nochanged TBC version which will all the shit that makes azeroth obsolete once again.
---
I like this one the most
---
When you say the platform - do you mean you just tank him on the throne platform he's on and jump off when he enrages? I've always pulled him down in front of it with no problems, though admittadly that's the brute force way to do it
---
Dwarf for stoneform, so that most dots don’t break stealth.
---
Gnome for escape artist, if you hate  cc and root.
---
I will say that undead in general have 4x as many morons as any other race in general though
---
Healing mobs so they can't die, forcing the horde to either stop questing or fight back is griefing. That's just like a level 60 killing 15s in Redridge... that reminds me, gotta kill level 15s in Redridge.
---
Weirdly enough I am the other way around. I would play only my mage up until the last patch of TBC before creating my first alt. Whereas now I got all classes, except mage, minimum lvl 20. Figures..
---
People who joined streamer server 100% knew what they signed up for. Its shitty all around. Streamers need to stream. If your stream is ruined every time, welp, youre fucked. If your content is just you ruining another streamers streams, youre kind of an idiot for thinking that would be 100% ok. If all he did was gank Asmon all day, there wouldnt be an issue here. 
---
If you were dumb enough to roll on the streamer server and assume itd be that classic experience, you are an idiot.
---
Dont forget to ninja as much as possible before transfer. You cant get banned and you will transfer away anyway. gl
---
I played since beta but took fairly long to reach 60 as most people at the time. However it was absolutely in the game when I was 60
---
If we are talking full pugs I don't think they'll get past mc/ony/aq20/zg. If we are talking like 60% guild who are pugging some spots then yeah BWL can be added.
---
Swap to Berserk to use Whirlwind, swap back to Battle
---
Any Warrior and frost mage. It would be called "I can finally afford things".
---
That makes a lot of sense but it doesn’t seem to show the amount of reagents left? Is there a prompt for that? That would be adequate for what I’m trying to do
---
What specifically did he do against ToS?  Not sure what "proof" or sniping really exists.
---
There are videos from both Asmond and Esfand of a horde "spy" standing next to them in the open world reporting their location to the Horde.
---
What people don't understand is that if you're in a guild that takes 2 hours for MC/Ony, that means BWL on farm will probably take 3 hours.  And 1.5 4 hour raid nights for AQ, and there's no way to even get to progressing in Naxx because it will reset before you reclear the 8 bosses you have on farm, with maybe 30 minutes in the week for progresion.
---
TLDR if you dislike a post saying the game should be better you're saying the game should be bad
---
How about taking some ownership of your actions I'm not your dad
---
For the Bored!
---
I'm not sure how that is misleading. Instead of doing 200% of their HP now you can just do 100% of their HP. 
---

The rogue was pretty clearly fucking with him, rather than going for a perfectly efficient kill.
---
Someone trying to sell one for 10k on our server.
---
Oh okay, so you also blame security transport workers for criminals trying to rob the transport?
---
Take yer downvote
---
I wonder if that actually works
---
Card games like Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering Arena can easily be played with one hand and they're both free. Online card games might not be for everyone though but I'm just throwing out an idea.
---
As I know nothing. Why is this sword really amazing?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlYCxbBZUCY
---
I would argue it was better
---
You obviously need to git gud m8
---
Thunderfury is the highest dps oh in the game for dps and the highest threat mh in the game for tanks.
---
gbank?
---
Gratz to GM
---
This subreddit is a dumpster fire what are you talking about
---
Do you actually read comments? Everyone's a vanilla expert because they subbed for a month in middle school and watched a Tipsout video
---
I can hear that last image perfectly.
---
It's may now
---
What do you mean I can't run Madoff scams in WoW!?
---
You won’t make any substantial money from enchanting unless you farm the top recipes and are willing to afk in cities for long periods of time. That said, doing that works well as a mage as you can sell portals/water as well.
---
Lol I have 8k pool in t1 in SL, not warrior is going to hit a 12k against a similarly geared AQ lock
---
Just use the xbox controller with your pc and use that in her left hand at whatever position is comfortable with it's buttons bound to abilities and then have her use the right for all the movement. I sold my xbox way back so maybe it's simpler to sync now but there used to be a package that allowed you to sync it up super easy.
---
Damage helps hold aggro but at your level ehhhh damage is pretty low, just focus on threat generation.  You could use a 2H but that will make it hard for your healers, who simply just don't have the gear to heal for a 2H tank yet unless you are overleveled/overgeared.
---
So with 1H+shield just focus on sunder.  Thats its.  Nothing but sunder.  Stack 1 on each target, then 2 on each, then 3, etc.  Play around with that a bit and then you can decide if you want to fit in other stuff like demoralizing shout.
---
A random tip I have since your level 20 is pick up a ranged weapon + ammo.  Don't be that tank that can only face pull or the one that charges into a room and aggros everything because he had to use charge.
---
Obviously what you say is not false but the comment you are replying to is pointing out a completely different thing. vanilla wow was way harder because of talents and itemization. Different patch
---
&gt; 1:1 means you can't ever form a group to attack a town or do anything you would in a war. 
---
This is invariably false.  Layering means the everyone syncs with the raid/party leader's layer.
---
Did you fucking group at all when layering was in effect?  Because I find it difficult to believe that someone would be so ignorant of a game mechanic having experienced it.
---
Kungen said on stream he replaced thunderfury well into tbc
---
Seen 2 of these drop from mc trash
---
Not really that rare
---
Twitch has preferential treatment for those that make them more money.
---
No unexpected, just pathetic.
---
By 'modern play style' I mean the hyper-optimal play. Almost everyone seems to be following the same BiS lists, want to skip all the packs that 'can' be skipped because that's 'the route', other things like that.
---
I guess this was inevitable, this game is 15 years old. Everything is known.
---
But I also think modern game design has changed how people play these games. Retail WoW, Destiny, etc. All these games with daily reward structures seem to make people more focused on 'completeing' a thing or checking something off the list of content. Less so on just doing stuff for the sake of playing, but doing content only because it leads to the reward which is next on their list.
---
And I guess these two things combine. This is a game where the optimal pieces of gear and spec and rotation have been completely figured out. There's much less room for exploration. So the focus is completely on ticking these things off the list instead of exploring.
---
(I'm kinda burnt out, especially with P2 making anything in the open world impossible. So take the post with a grain of salt)
---
I'm combat daggers and refuse to respec for pvp so it's usually ambush/backstab/tea/backstab and they're dead unless it's a prot warrior.
---
\[Alliance\]: Target The Warrior!!  
---
\[Alliance2\]: WHAT?!? Why?  
---
\[Me with Nameplate TheWarrior\]: &gt;:)
---
IMO Enchanting is a terrible profession and anyone who wants to be the guy that pays for it and somehow gets their guild to give them the rare enchants the server needs, have fun making your money back slowly. I’d go Tailoring/Engineering
---
Definitely rate this guy 15/10.
---
Yes. Imp Blizzard adds the "Chill" effect to your Blizzard. Permafrost makes the "Chill" effect more potent.
---
The BEST time to start was 15 years ago. The next best time was some time between then and now. Now is the next best time to start playing. Better late then never! That way it is never too late! Trust me I played a Gnome Warlock then, and I do now.
---
Dark edge of insanity is the best pvp weapon.  The proc is broken good
---
Go to retail you let me know how well bonuses work.
---
Streamers were and are a mistake.
---
Name the last stream you saw of him with Asmon's name in the title.
---
What seems to be the problem?
---
This worked out great!
---
Imagine bringing a ret pally to your serious rank grinder organized battleground premade
---
If it works like other stuff in the game such as the WPL lich guy, you can kill him in a raid group but you can't loot yet, so you just drop group and then you can loot.  Easy money.
---
Asmongold felt into it.  He’s at fault.  Could have completely ignored it but chose not to.
---
Conversely, that group probably disappeared when the horde sent in 2 groups and once, squashed them, and then camped their corpses.  
---
I would know because that happened to me yesterday.
---
why would you need a taunt? If a priest shackles one guy he has a very very very low amount of threat on the rest... one tick of consecrate will bring them to the tank.
---
Noooo!
---
And I thought I was clever..
---
As someone who is alliance on a heavily horde skewed server it can be fun.. sometimes. Usually only if you have a group of people to roam around with. 
---
If you’re just trying to quest or run to a dungeon or do anything else basically it’s a nightmare. 
---
I’m ok with it since I’m 60 and have my epic mount and 80% BiS for the phase so I’m generally just raid logging but I could imagine having to level up right now with your main could be incredibly frustrating
---
You could not.  You could do PvP to PvP or PvP to PvE but you could never go PvE to PvP.
---
4 people? My sweet summer child... all the flightmasters are dead. And the boats have 10-20 horde on it at all time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctn-tKXx4Sw
---
This is horde pvp:p
---
I know he doesn't. There is a small hope that, if explained properly and in simply enough terms, they'll gain an understanding.
---
Wonder what happened to Kungen? He was streaming all the time and his stream was doing well. Haven't seen him on in a few months
---
And what's the DPS.
---
Yeah that's my issue with this drama, Advertise has literally NO REASON to streamsnipe and risk his account as he can figure out where Asmon is himself without ever watching his stream. Other people could actually run into him in the world and whisper Advertise, he could log into his alliance toon or just run into him organically, most of the content in this phase is centered around world bosses and BRM after all. As for the "harassment" part, this certainly goes both ways, with Asmon throwing slurs at Advertise. All this shows is that the old 4Chan meme about not daring to offend the godly streamers has become truth.
---
1. Who the fuck is still leveling
---
2. The people camping out in the world 24/7 grinding honor have most of the gold they need already, increasing the AH tax has little to do with fixing inbalance. 
---
3. Is actually a good idea, I support you on this one. But I think Blizzard might be hesitant to reintroduce layers after taking it away 3-4 weeks ago. 
---
Wait until BGs for further analysis.
---
If you look at any good dpsers log, you'll know that BT isn't even 20% of your damage. It's literally just auto attacks and HS spams bro lmao.
---
If you blindly follow sims and force a narrative that you came up with to explain the sims, more power to you I guess.
---
By that logic no one would buy it as it would take months to break even on it.
---
That's not griefing. That's literally just PvP.
---
People are welcome to PvP to PvE server move?  When did that happen?
---
Are you a game designer?  If so, are you hiring?  Have you built a single fucking game system, had a hand in design, in implementing balance; been on a board of, well, anything of note related to what you purport to be an authority on?  
---
No, no you haven't.
---
You also fail at reading comprehension from the original post I replied to.  But I can understand that given your overall sheer ignorance of just about everything.
---
Yup exactly.  I ran out of mana healing my tank just standing still, the enrage chunks really bad.
---
&gt; I could imagine having to level up right now with your main could be incredibly frustrating
---
I've got an alt druid at 45 right now, it's not as bad as people make it out to be unless you try to level in SG.
---
This whole drama is silly. They are all just attention seeking guys trying to make money off this. Im not sure this moral or ethical outrage at anyone. No tears shed.
---
Oh then I have no idea.  I just noticed that with my warlock spells that required shards.  I just assumed it was the same for rogues.
---
I also use dual + 15, but I wondered about using are there do life stealing or do Unholy. Unholy in particular, if I understand it right, means that melee Fighters will not actually damage you hardly at all
---
"Laughing my fucking ass off, probably"
---
&gt;  Streamers need to stream. If your stream is ruined every time, welp, youre fucked.
---
Streamers can play on a PvE server.
---
If you're looking for a good time solo playing then hunter/warlock :)
---
Please elaborate at length what is wrong with them, and substitute your better ideas so that they may be judged.
---
You won't.  Too much of a pussy.
---
You can jump directly to the bridge too and avoid dying.  Or slowfall.
---
This is why engi is so great for sham pvp. Grenade, netomatic, rocket helm are so useful for CC.
---
Look at his Twitter
---
Who’s on first.
---
Tru tru..
---
Im so tired of the hundreds of ppl afk in IF on sulfuras. I try rallying Troops to go fight but no one cares. It’s impossible to farm or quest or do anything. Horde were raiding IF the other night and no one cared
---
He literally bitched about getting hit by a bomb...
---
Found asmon's alt account
---
Damm! Thats 8g to vendor! Gz
---
It looks like a blue lightsaber when equipped.
---
You can heal as shadow but be sure to have a high rank heal.
---
For some reason I'm having the exact opposite experience. I used to be all about min maxing and devoting everything to my main. Now I have an alt of every class... I have no idea what happened.
---
fairbanks?
---
Guilds would drop mc / ony to progress naxx instead of only spendong 30 minutes there lol
---
Weapons with fiery enchant.  That 40 damage procs a lot.
---
the up/downvote system takes care of them
---
if they are upvoted they are obviously what people want to see
---
That's not what I said, but you're the guy who spouts bullshit so I'm not surprised.
---
&gt;cant farm kills in bgs due to 5 kills cap
---
That cap is removed for BGs
---
Can't agree more, any fix right now will be a bad one.
---
Their incentive is more alliance to kill.
---
Really? Did 'Light's Hope' have at least 56 servers with thousands of people playing?
---
He's right... it DOES sound like a gay porn title.
---
People still use twitch?
---
IIRC, all flutes share a cooldown in Classic. You’ll have to choose between UD&gt;Water (x2) or Arcanite
---
&lt;3 Hope it comes soon man!

You posted this 3 hours ago

---
actually fucking stupid this is the man that said he would camp every horde zone until they quit the game??????????
---
Hide of the wild, because I'm worth it.
---
If you haven't had Points where the warrior was Fun, the gear won't matter. Yeah, they do scale well with gear but the playstyle doesn't change.
---
So?  Why is that newsworthy?
---
Tbh I was only being rude because his answer was really silly and he made the amazon reference and it annoyed me and I'm in a bad mood.
---
I agree moving servers aren't too easy but that's something blizz can make better without changing game mechanics significantly.
---
While a lot of people have communities they don't want to leave there's a lot of people who don't have this who want to stay on the "big" servers because other servers are "dead". Which is laughable because the lowest populated servers are still over the cap of vanilla servers.
---
I've moved from the highest pop server to the lowest in oce and I've found it fine so far.
---
Thank you so much, I'll try that.
---
Watch as minor e-celeb and his fellow guildies make themselves look stupid.
---
It's just funny he cries about getting camped on a PvP server.
---
World pvp is dead if imbalance is bad. Some servers you can run around for hours only getting a handful of honorable kills, even then you're likely splitting them with 5-10 people.
---
Not in twink pvp
---
Bro all you gotta do is slapper charge fade vanish reset the fight big hp pot FAP and cold blood Pyro  you fuckin Scrub.
---
PvP on a pvp server 🤷‍♂️
---
Funny thing is that hardcore ranker pvp guilds who care about min maxing battleground premade class compositions will likely not desire a shadow priest either.  Shadow priests are sick in 1v1 fights but theyre not really necessary or optimal for team fights or anything else. They're not bad but you dont really need one either.
---
All the top parsing warriors that are 2H fury are slam spec though.
---
 I dont like asmongold at all really but stream sniping is a scum move and against a lot of different rules in place by twitch and games aswell.
---
Me too! Never met anyone else who does this too :)
---
If only they had over a decade worth of data showing this exact same thing happening before, multiple times. If only :(
---
Would you rather make gold through disenchanting or get the bloodvine bonus in phase 4?
---
I dunno it seemed like an insult they learned from middle school.
---
Reeks of "talk to the hand" etc.
---
Why not send some gold to your warrior from your other chars and buy gear from the AH?
---
Have you met many gnomes?
---
He got banned for harassment. Probably had something to do with profiting from a channel with his name in every title he and his chat laugh about how his girlfriend is a slutty leech and how they hope his sick mother dies so he stops streaming for a while.....but go ahead and think the QQ is strong, you're clearly a good person deep down.
---
&gt; I'm not a huge Asmon fan, but I've watched a few of the videos on his "Real life" channel where he talks about his life
---
Did you also watch his vid where he kind of proudly shows off his collection of McD beverages that are over a year old and how his entire room looks like a roach infested nightmare?
---
If you charge the enemy going to the mage you're also charging the rest of the pack thats going to the mage, 1 charge is 1 demo shout or Tclap. You can swap after that and do the rest of your tank duties. If the mage did nothing but poly 1 demo shout will pull the adds off of him.
---
Thank you for your response!
---
An actual sane response to streamers bitching about their own stupidity. God, i love Blizzard so much.
---
I too ended up on heartseeker but being the dominant faction is actually a sweet as hell deal. My only concern is stealth bomb groups and roaming killsquads but I can get to BRM with maybe one death if I’m solo, I can farm mostly in peace, summon outside dungeons etc 
---
The only reason I chose a pvp server was for those random 1v1/2v1 death duels and the fact I can fight for a mining/herbing node if a Horde’s after it. The wpvp honor farm 24/7 thing wasn’t what I imagined, so I’m really glad I ended up on one of the only alliance majority pvp servers
---
idk lol just thought it was funny :)
---
I mean, he wasnt just camped. he was hunted specifically to ruin his gameplay. That is a big difference. If a roaming raid wiped him out and moved on, its different than "gather everyone we know and hunt this one dude." 
---
Some raid runs me over, whatever. Some raid decides they hate my name and I dont get to play anymore tonight? Difference.
---
Kargoz is kinda an asshat tho ngl.. can’t say I’m surprised
---
*probably* haha
---
I always made middle click my autorun, for 15 years now.  It's really convenient.
---
when asmon said this we thought he meant that he would kill horde with his raids but actually what he meant is that he'll just have you banned.
---
Watch as random redditor posts shit that nobody cares about
---
It is griefing, and it is pvp.
---
4hm sapphiron KT will be a bridge too far for pugs. Maybe gothik, too.
---
Pugs will also struggle on twin emps and cthun.
---
Shadow priest should fit that bill. PoM Pyro mage as well. Rogue is very good 1v1 but weak when outnumbered. And lastly shaman, where both Enh and Ele offer high Burst builds.
---
It'll probably be more like 1200 for a non flag carrier to begin with. It didn't really hit 1500 as a norm until fishing gear and heirlooms hit the scene.
---
Which server are you on? I made a healer on old blanchy. I'd be more than happy to run with you if you ever need a solid healer that won't rage
---
Is that Advertises real voice or just a gimmick?
---
the kind of guild that wants 5 curse of dooms proccing on onyxia at the same time when shes in phase 2.
---
Anyone know how bad the ratio is on morgraine?
---
I don't see enough dots.
---
&gt; I mean, he wasnt just camped. he was hunted specifically to ruin his gameplay.
---
This happens on any server to a lot of people. I was the only alliance in Everlook for the past two nights at 11pm vs 18+ horde constantly. People don't move on after killing you in Classic, people camp just to grieve.
---
Bandage puts a 60s cooldown on the bandagee...more than one is pointlesd
---
Okay. Now that is pretty dope
---
Me and my group were just randomly rolling in BRD yesterday, I rolled a 94, then my teammate did, and then a priest did. 3 94s in a row it was weird
---
people who A D spam are actually the worst kinds of people.
---
AV is releasing same time. Back in Vanilla it was premade AB/WSG and top up with AV when premade wasn't running or you wanted to AFK in the cave with a jump script. Obviously AB isn't an option for now. No one really farmed honor in world pvp for rank though there was a lot of world PvP.
---
we just /roll and people only get 1 till everyone has 1
---
how old are you ,just asking
---
It's not really supposed to be there for the stats, like. Drakefire amulet, this item enables content for the player.
---
“Downtime” aka driving a half ton car 60mph on a freeway
---
Nah, horde were the ones camping the entrance doing AOE.
---
Yeah but my guild (10+ IRL friends) convinced me to stay after a 2 week hiatus.
---
&gt; Watch as random Redditor make themselves look stupid.
---
OP isn't driving..
---
Druid = King of face pull
---
Last night we discovered that if someone kills the NPC that you turn the head into and they respawn, you can drop the head again. Make of that what you will.
---
Trash ally war can't 1v6 lol
---
You're right - with dense sharpening stones for both, DB+ CHT + ACLG shows +3 dps over using the DB + flurry axe offhand with Flameguard Gauntlets. With elemental (crit) sharpening stone on the offhand, it's +21 dps higher.
---
More importantly, it's +15 dps over using DB / DB with the Flameguard Gauntlets. This makes it an excellent choice for a dual wield orc. Now I wish I included a section on orcs (and humans) with ACLG on the original list!
---
What about players in game telling him where Asmon is. Or what about him logging into his lvl 1 alliance alt and doing /who?
---
If he does that while Asmon is streaming, is that stream sniping? Could you prove the difference between the former techniques and stream sniping? Especially when he has an Alliance alt, and has shown many different times that random horde WILL message him streamer locations.
---
Like if we were taking this to court this wouldn't even get to the "preponderance of the evidence" standard let alone the much stricter "beyond a reasonable doubt."
---
Auctioneer definitely does it, aside from that addon i dont know which other ones do it, sorry =(
---
Anyone on Benediction feel like our server's been exempt from all this PVP drama? I definitely noticed more PVP, but it doesn't feel like any one side has been dominating the other.
---
That said I'm on Horde so maybe I just haven't been noticing it.
---
I’m just busting balls.  Sorry if I struck a nerve.
---
You can't, I think thats just info stored in your WTF / cache files locally.
---
Hey, sometimes you get sapped
---
Must be a lot of Brits on Reddit right now
---
Paladins can duel wield? Isnt that a warrior with quelsellar?
---
Silence the music ingame and put it in background
---
hordes be like "wheres the problem?" laughing from their detection prividing zeppelin guard tower
---
This is a rated teen game but I just witnessed a gangbang
---
Thx mate
---
IIRC from yonks ago, it's cross faction as in battlegroups. You'd see the same five or six servers all in one group, so wasn't like the entire WoW population was in a queue for battlegrounds. 
---
Yes Horde will still be out death-squadding and rolling around. I recall having to queue for a battleground in Orgrimmar, so I had to go back to Org every time I got into an AV. Going over to Felwood, PVP-ing, and then zoning into AV half an hour later means a lot of transit time. A lot of people back in the day just hung out in the city organizing their bank or AH-ing.
---
Pay no attention to the poor players, he probably doesn't have an epic mount.
---
Got a source?
---
Well as he said that was just an example. Innervate for example was a 31pt resto druid talent. Now every druid has it. And the reason you don't use greater heal is because there exists a TON of +healing gear now, which was VERY hard to come by pre-raid in the early days of WoW.
---
What are some good class combos for me and my girlfriend to play?
---
What’s that old saying? When you’ve been in a privileged position your whole life equality begins to feel a lot like oppression.
---
Yeah, last time i got quite a few replies, so someone does care... 
---
Instead you just went out of your way to be rude. To each his own! Have a nice day!
---
Hey there - I’m level 22 and put all of my talents in holy.  Should I respec?  Thanks so much for any help.
---
How is it harassment when what he did is perfectly allowed within the confines of the game and not considered harassment on pvp servers.
---
Obviously heals, you is the paladin
---
&gt;  The imbalance problem isnt blizzards, it's the players as they picked the servers to play on.
---
Its blizzard problem because they didn't give players any indication of faction balances prior to picking their servers. How could a person know how the population would be balance out at before rolling on the server?
---
"If half of the stats on this item weren't there this item would be weak"
---
You obviously aren’t a dps warrior lol!
---
True.  But if you are leveling to 60, using heavy runecloth when the first two ticks hit for 100% of your health is just pissing gold away.
---
I don't see much hate for private servers here. Rather, I see people from private servers insisting that they know everything about Classic and anyone who didn't play on a private server had no idea which way is up. Those are the people this sub rejects.
---
Whoosh?
---
Maybe you wouldn't, I know a shit load of people who would.
---
I'm not saying he didn't do it, but to expect as a major streamer not to be camped is hilarious, he also sent plenty of people to camp the guy.
---
Advertise was literally streaming while he was corpse camped by Unbind and then he was harassed by Esfand and Asmon in a discord between the 3 and Staysafe before tmugsy came in to stick up for Advertise. 
---
The steam title going into that had nothing to do with Asmon or Olympus and was effectively "Spy Add-On Banned." Because this was after the combat log nerf. 
---
So idk what you mean to imply by saying that advertise was targeting a steamer while leaving out that Advertise was targeted by Olympus while streaming for 2.5k viewers.
---
Now why was he getting corpse camped. Because he recorded the guild meeting Olympus had (off-stream) and was told it was ok for him to play that recoding on stream. So he did so and was basically adding commentary about how he felt about it (since the meeting was about world bosses). Unbind, the Olympus officer, either to stir shit or because he didn't like that Advertise was critiquing the meeting, ordered all Olympus on at the time to corpse camp him. After it was clear they were stream sniping and corpse camping, he then switched his content to being more disparaging against Olympus and Asmon. 
---
I'll admit this was a few days ago and I haven't been able to keep up with it recently, but if this all started from back then, which it seems to have, then I don't see Asmon as blameless. He, or more specifically his officers (who he had banned from Olympus previously for toxicity), harassed Advertise for making commentary on a meeting he was allowed to attend and was told was ok to stream after the fact. I would tell you to watch the vod, but unfortunately, twitch removes everything when an account is banned so going to be hard to find full steam video.
---
I don't even paly WoW right now and I'm willing to be someone did for the joke. I played games where people spent massive amounts of money upgrading the weakest items just so they can beat people with sticks as  ajoke.
---
Winning a WSG (including flag caps and mark turn in) is nearly 1800 honor. Add in the many kills you will get, and it's extremely unlikely world pvp can compete. BGs are also very steady and reliable honor at all hours of the day and all days of the week.
---
Krom Krishna got fucked by alliance leaving if I’m thinking correctly :(
---
I'm on Kirtonos too and can relate. As an alliance warrior tank that can't go invis, it takes on average like 10 deaths to get to BRD/LBRS, also usually wasting my 30 min cd shield wall to advance as far as possible, and using some invis pots (which is crippling my economy) and also wasting a lot of time coordinating with the party to ress all at the same time to increase our chance of surviving.
---
Getting to those instances means just investing like an hour at minimum, JUST TO GET IN!! Then you have like 1-2 hours if lucky to complete the run.
---
And I just didn't even mention getting to Light's Hope, where getting/turning-in a quest is like "GO GO GO!! Do it fast, don't read, just click, die", then die like 3 or 4 more times to get out of the place.
---
I like the feeling of a dangerous world, and that there can be PvP anywhere, I actually suck at PvP and lose most 1v1s, but is nice to get a random duel every now and then. But now the game just feels dumb. I played every day and several hours after work, now I connect a while, see if some guildies are connected to do a dungeon, and usually leave because the guildies are getting tired of the game too.
---
It sucks, but this phase killed the game for me, I don't even know if I will get back when phase 3 comes, even if PvP calms down, I'm not as hooked-up as before, and my hype went off hard.
---
This. I play with a Logitech G600. It has twelve buttons on the side and a modifier button on the mouse you press with your ring finger that gives you another twelve. 24 keybinds should be plenty.
---
The problem is population, not rez location. It’s nice to try to give ideas, but, IN MY OPINION, this is the exact way of thinking that got us to retail. And It feels dangerous.
---
Your solution would probably make open world empty as everyone would simply die preemptively (to prevent dying in the way as a living character) and just run in as ghosts. It feels too easily exploitable.
---
&gt; This also includes exploiting another broadcaster's live broadcast in order to harass them in-game, such as stream sniping.
---
That's actually ridiculous and almost impossible to prove.
---
You don't have to stream snipe asmon to know where he is, you just have to ask in general chat "where is asmon".
---
Are you sure it's cross-faction?
---
AFAIK the devs confirmed that BGs would be cross-realm.
---
The Youtube video voice is exaggerated, but it doesn't sound that different from his real voice.
---
He built a community and his stream around harrassing asmon and his fanbase, he deserved to get banned.
---
People just excuse it because asmon is a personality on twitch.
---
Every one of his twitch titles had asmongold in it and it was always negative, this is harrassment and is against twitch TOS, it's not against TOS to gank someone in game, that's a game mechanic and part of a PVP server, but actually cyber-bullying and harrassing someone online outside of the game's PVP system is not okay.
---
Nice I scan the AH everyday for greater arcane elixir recipe and sure enough today I scan and there is one up for 5g 69s. I buy it instantly. A friend I know said his guildie paid over 800g
---
That's what happens when you let 12 yr olds on the internet.
---
With Skarm, isn't that more a reflection of the private server community moreso than Twitch?  I'm asking an honest question.  It's probably both.
---
Haha yes exactly this.
---
Sounds intentional
---
my guild was server first for rag. we had a core 40 members who got 60 within the first 1-2 weeks. 
---
just before p2 we had 2 raids, the good one and the new players/alts/ anyone else. p2 drops and no one will run to mc anymore. Our core group has their loot and wont be bothered to run in, and the new/alt group can hardly full clear so most people leave without warning on the way while corpse running. there was a big transfer off the server within the guild, and now im looking at 3-10 people max online during peak. 
---
i dont really care about all the events that lead us here but something is really wrong right now. I cant play the game without a guild, and whats left is even hardly playable anyway. I dont mind a little inbalance on faction population but whats happened is just a joke
---
Yes...most Horde definitely have an advantage. Great pvp racials besides trolls (style points) and higher pops on most servers by quite a bit.
---
Yea but I mean the odd greens that drop from your level mobs should be your level. Its not like that would make quests or dungeons irrelevant.
---
Why not just specify the current rule to:
---
Ganking a popular streamer will result in a ban from twitch.
---
Idk, I've noticed the whole the_donald thing goes pretty hand and hand with today's neckbeards. I guess it is seen as super edgy to them, idk.
---
Oh, disenchanting is a good point! I completely forgot about that. I do make some money with that, mostly by buying lvl 36-40 blues/epics for less than the price of 1/3-4 Small Radiant Shard(s). All types of Dust and most Essences (except for the Eternal ones) are not worth much on my realm though. The price the vendor pays for the gear is often higher than what the enchanting mats would be worth.
---
I just don't know how good the 2% spell crit bonus is. I'd guess it's quite good, because when it comes out Mages will play Fire.
---
I'm a hunter who's been raiding Ony since week 4.  Seen the black sinew (\~40% drop rate) only once.  Didn't go to me.  Been sitting here with my dick in my hand for months.
---
The Warrior is on a different server. I moved to Faerlina when it happened.
---
Nice lies mate, Gotta ride that asmon dick harder tho
---
Not to mention the fact that in 2005 there weren't dozens if not hundreds of YouTube guides explaining exactly how to exploit any and all imbalance.
---
As a warrior player - I am totally at the mercy of rogues who outgear me and 100% of frost mages.  These guys can usually perfect me without cooldowns or consumables but if there's any chance I migh win they have enough escapes and controls to rely on that I can't fight back.   I am not as good at vidya was I once was, but I have top 10 raiding experience at various points in my life and hit 2400 rena rating once or twice.
---
And this is *before* we consider the engineering 1 hit macros that rely on consumables to win, which almost any class can use.
---
P2 destroyed PvP servers and ruined the game, and Blizzard can't do anything about it because they are afraid of butthurting the #nochanges crowd.
---
If BGs are not successful in stopping the constant FP and BRM camping that is happening on these 10k pop servers, the subs will evaporate.
---
I speak for a lot of '05 WoW vets when I say I'm simply *too old* for this bulshit.
---
And, as I said, if the dude had *just* camped Asmon and left it at that, it would be different.
---
*Instead* he streamed it, promoted it, and targeted Asmon *specifically* to create content *on his channel on the same platform.*
---
I dont see how that is hard to fathom? The *platform* banned him for interfering with another *platform* user. 
---
That is still a lot different than "streamer being camped" and calling it a simple gank-n-camp is disingenuous.
---
Asmon sent folks out sure, afterwards. I dont think that puts him in the right, either though.
---
dat wifi
---
u/dareal_MarkyMark should be offered a job at bliz.
---
It depends what you're fighting when you're over specced. It you can't let them out of cc, I'd say:
---
cheap shot&gt;gouge&gt;Kindey&gt;however many sinister strikes you can get off before cc break (prob1)&gt;blind&gt;restealth&gt;sap&gt;restealth&gt;kidney&gt;adrenaline rush&gt;sinister spam into eviscerate for execute. 
---
You can straight up mong it vs some other classes like war/shammy or casters that aren't mages and cheap shot into adrenaline rush with blind as a safety net. 
---
The PvP spec is just significantly better for 1v1.
---
its about intent also , its 1 thing to shit talk in general. shit talk because u want make a point or chat brings the Q and u answer , and u can do that several times as long its not "hey my tittle is shit talking about X person ,again  - so come and watch me "
---
My Eff up on the wording. Cross Realm, but not across all realms.
---
It seems that most people that are commenting on this thread have never watched Advertise’s streams. He doesn’t encourage people to harass asmon and he bans everyone who does. He even stopped ganking him so much ever since the whole “I’m quitting the server thing”.
---
I have this same problem with a slight variation. I believe we are both experiencing kernel panics - but for me it’s only when I try to log on to a character in a major city. Every time I log in it just first be on an alt parked in a random Inn away from Org. 
---
Not sure if you’re having that same problem specifically, but either way it looks like our CPUs are trying to do too much on initial load in and flaking. I have a 19 MBP. I have tried many things to try and fix this but it’s been consistent for me since launch. Hopefully we can find a solution.
---
okay cool!!
---
You know how I know you don't play the game that much? You're valuing an xp buff above all your other suggestions.
---
Leveling to 60 in wow classic is not that hard.
---
Inb4 he's on heartseeker
---
Yeah soulstones and healthstones go. 
---
Like I said some people on the net talk about remembering shards going as well, so maybe once they were conjured items and this is being repeated from that point and so people still think it was the case? Either that or someone somewhere said it wrong and it's been repeated
---
Wow u ankh.....  u are a so hardcore skiller... omg
---
Overlooked and underrated. Thanks for pointing this option out. It's about +9 dps to run Thrash / Flurry / Edgemaster's instead of Thrash / Mirah's / Flameguard Gauntlets.
---
Just taking a jab at classic bashers
---
How do you know "nochangers" are the problem if this is first time you have played WoW in its original format? If this is your first time, how do you know what the differences were?
---
Each book has roughly a 1% chance of spawning. Since there's 8 books you have around 8% chance of getting something else than that god damned nat pagles fishing book. Not getting one in five sounds very normal. If you've been getting more than that in the past you've been lucky and your lucks ran out.
---
You can’t really blame it on the game designers, as this is what people ASKED for.  It is t blizzards fault people suck.
---
What is life? Why are we here?
---
Zug zug!
---
im too tired man. i read this sentence like a pokemon attack
---
&gt; asmongold uses corporate cronies to silence and shut down proud trans woman of color. It was super effective
---
I am 99%sure I went pvp to pve at some point during classic.
---
I looked  back on my transactions but seems like they keep only 7 years
---
Bruh, this is a streaming service, not a court lmao.
---
Would you happen to have that macro?
---
Your ego must be so huge to be as much entitle. 
---
Kido you need to understand that your POV doesn't stand for the truth, it's your version of a good game because and maybe your are not alone here.
---
&gt;How about taking some ownership of your actions I'm not your dad
---
Hopefully not xD
---
They are the most expensive item in the game.
---
You're right - just use BoP on the tank and then bandage them
---
Druid pay the hybrid tax and a lot of the hybrid specs still miss out on talents pure ferals/restos would grab. Allowing everyone to multi spec makes hybrids even worse and kills their unique identity too.
---
&gt; Well they intentionally chose horde so, yeah it kinda is. They knew they were going to have an advantage on the Alliance, they probably also knew they were gonna have a numerical advantage.
---
This might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen in this sub.
---
????
---
did you not see his old cata/mop videos?
---
it is indeed a whoosh panda who can not be seen
---
If you get the Aged Core Leather Gloves, then a slow axe MH (like Deathbringer or the Frostbite axe from av rep in p2.5, or Deep Woods for now) and the Core Hound Tooth offhand is excellent.
---
i always have a few swiftness pots, swim speed pots, and underwater breathing elixirs for those annoying quests where you're underwater for long periods of time. swim speed pots especially for alliance because making that swim across feralas to feathermoon is a pain.
---
Does it though? What if we had dual spec, but you could only change it in a main city. How would that kill their identity then?
---
Does the average british car have no steering wheel too?
---
Yup. The bonuses came far too late into the game. Racials are almost meaningless on retail now because some only have a difference of double digit or triple digit numbers (DPS is currently in the upper part of 5 digits) iirc, which means the sole reason to play on either horde or alliance should be which faction you prefer.
---
Yet the racials were kept relatively unbalanced and important for far too long, so that most serious raiding guilds and players swapped over to horde and we got ourselves a snowball effect.
---
Thank you
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Unfortunately this is what happens when people have been playing the game on private servers for 10+ years and know the most efficient ways to farm honor are flight path and dungeon entrance camping. WoW classic was doomed to be nothing like original vanilla because the community has changed so much (As well as the stupidly overpopulated servers compared to vanilla), and it's been completely figured out. Encouraging this is like encouraging someone to go use a well known route with lots of rich thorium. Honor is nothing but points right now to anyone looking to get a certain rank, and they don't give a shit about you and your experience. This allows people to be incredibly toxic, with an excuse of "Oh blizz is making me do this if i want to rank". Honestly with the way the system is set up especially without bgs, if you're not willing to be toxic and ruin someone else's playing experience, you're going to fall behind.
---
Hard to blame these guys for taking advantage of the systems given to them. Hopefully it improves when bgs release.
---
Thank you random person on the internet who I do not value their opinion.
---
\*ManKRIK
---
But what happened to that mana water?
---
It's not about the \~10gold he can sell it for. Its about name and shame.  
---
This behavior should not be encouraged. But you are right, next time we'll all need on BOE.
---
modern problems require modern solutions
---
Humble brag time. I accidently ninja looted Krol Blade the other night. I turned on FFA loot in BRD for the flame room, and forgot to turn it off after. I auto looted it from the boss, then calmly told the group to roll and gave it to the winner. We put loot back on group and finished without any drama.
---
Sorry you lost your group over a much cheaper item.
---
are you trying to start a witchhunt? usually don't downvote, faction balance or not, fuck off
---
That’s why you just have to need. There’s always that 1 guy you can’t trust
---
In about 99% of cases NO ONE should be pulling except for the tank. Kick these people and get rid of them so these people actually have to learn to play and stop trying to do other's jobs.
---
You don't farm gold until 60, it's just inefficient compared to leveling first.
---
Warriors offer tanking services/reserve sellables in dungeons, or duo/trio DM east for thorium veins.
---
Lets not. There would be so much more trash in this sub if rule 7 got removed...
---
Yeah I get stomped on by alliance constantly on Fairbanks. Neither side has a walk in the park.
---
Downvoted because you didn’t consider he was passenger. I feel this ! Good for you man .. good for you !
---
Rivenspike / Bone Slicing Hatchet is a good combo.
---
You can avoid wearing flurry axe or edgemaster's if you want to save gold. In general you probably never want to equip Edgemaster's. Instead you should try for an axe mainhand (like Deathbringer or Frostbite in p2.5) or a 2h axe (like Arcane Reaper or Spinal Reaver). If you can't get a good axe offhand (like Flurry Axe), it's possible that you might want to get the Aged Core Leather Gloves to use a dagger offhand (like Bonescraper, Heartseeker, Felstriker, or Core Hound Tooth). They're better gloves than Edgemaster's because they at least have some stats (other than weapon skill).
---
You can also continue to use the Bone Slicing Hatchet offhand until p3 when the Doom's Edge drops from trash in BWL. This will make it easier to get Flameguard Gauntlets (instead of ACLG), which is probably the smarter long term decision in p3 and beyond.
---
Spy is bugging, only displaying 44 players haha
---
you very well know he goes out of his way to kill him , 1 thing is to log in and be like today and tomorrow ill gank that person , another thing is to dedicate everything to that 1 person. As i said he goes out of his way constantly  - he even has ppl going left and right on the map just so that they can tell him where he is.
---
and btw him leaving to a PVE server will end the current one and probably adv stream ,cause for right now i dont think he can make content on his own ,he needs outside source
---
funny, an allience player makes a threat just like this one, gets downvotet to hell by horde players
---
like the horde players told that guys i tell you -&gt; git gud
---
How much do you spend per year where a couple million doesn’t set you up for life? Absolutely shit take
---
No. His page was just moved to a different castle.
---
Yea I got that ! I don’t get the meme
---
This is why I never use CD in game
---
You brought this upon himself.
---
why should I have to pay money to fix their mistake
---
1) fuck that and fuck you for suggesting it
---
2) doesn't that incentivize doing this over and over and over and over again and never doing anything correctly because you can charge for the fix?
---
If your heals get sniped, that means you're either running too many healers, or (if it causes issues such as people dying) need to assign healing targets.
---
Read this:

https://brainingguild.wordpress.com/2018/01/29/vanilla-wow-priest-healing-guide/#Common_Pitfalls
---
My priest is 60 and if I'm flagged in Org on Pagle I just die to rogues.  They camp the bank, AH, etc, wait until you get distracted with something and just combo you down.  I have enough time to trinket/fear at like 20% life just for them to trinket/finish/vanish.  It's dumb so I stopped PVPing.
---
That rogue isn’t very good lol
---
Yeah I assumed this was the case, figured I'd ask to make sure though.
---
Class identity is not what you think. Maybe you mean spec identity. Because a prot warrior is still a warrio just the same as arms or fury. What's the difference from paying to change specs? That now you got a gold sink? Spec identity will never be there if there's a way to change specs.
---
Yeah that’s pretty much how the real world works kiddo
---
Some people its their first time playing this game and literally have no clue. Some have been tanking for years on various private servers since vanilla. And the rest are somewhere in between.
---
It's not just that but quests for the alliance are severely lacking compared to how many horde seem to have. We just get more polished cities despite fewer questing hubs. Looks nice but theres nothing to do at them other than use as a flight point
---
It really depends on your gear, and mana pool size. Current thinking is if you have 3+ T1 pieces &amp; some pre-BIS you can down rank your Flash Heal to 4 Greater Heal to 1 and Heal to 3. Once you have Benediction + 3 x T1 and 2 x T2 you can think about down ranking to Flash Heal 3. If you have question about gear, feel free to PM.
---
Eh, he killed him a few times in a video game mate, why should advertise have empathy towards that? Seems silly to worry about feelings here. Why is it advertise responsibility to control his viewers going to other streams?
---
Yeah yeah hes a little obsessive about asmon but dude there's like 5 or 10 youtube channels that clip asmon DAILY that make money off it. Which asmon him self has said he doesnt care to collect on.
---
Hes only being a baby because he fucked up and followed his buddies to a pvp server knowing he wasnt going to measure up to the sweaty nerds that play classic the meta way and is getting ripped apart by any coordinated group.
---
Asmon talked a bunch of shit before pvp got incentivized then got shit on. That's why hes mad, poor baby isnt getting free rank 14 like he can get free pve gear.
---
I cant believe anyone can defend asmon on this one. Biggest leech on twitch, watches other people's youtube videos taking views away while getting his alts leveled up by guildies while having the audacity to bitch at his guild mates that they arent 60 yet or full bis yet. Does gake anytime to be a good gm and help anyone other than his close group. 
---
But hey it's a video game who cares anyways LOL classic ain't gonna be around forever anyways.
---
There is absolutely zero difference between either faction. 
---
If the alliance had the same advantage horde did on Fairbanks, you would see the exact same shit.
---
This is the big one. Heals, dispels and if you have the opportunity then Mana burn.
---
&gt;	If you’re an X, you should not be pulling for the tank
---
This sub needs less of these specific anecdotes. 
---
Pretty much all these threads are good for is forming a circle jerk for other people who’ve happened to have a bad experience with said class.
---
Hunters in Vanilla were known for rolling on just about everything, despite the items being less than ideal for them.
---
The meme "hunter item" started a while ago where hunters would roll on stuff like +healing items for their "mend pet". While they did get a benefit from the healing items, it was a bit silly for a hunter to compete with a priest/pally/shammy/druid for a healing item.
---
So what you're saying is, I need mining
---
Nah their analogy actually works perfectly fine. I'm sorry you don't understand it.
---
If you are having trouble playing a game because of what you're doing outside of the game, then perhaps the two aren't compatible.   To complain that the people in charge of the game need to do something to fix the situation that you have put yourself in, especially when said situation has absolutely nothing to do with the game itself, to me, is tremendously fucking stupid.
---
Enhancement shaman is basically occasionally fun for a brief period in vanilla lifespans when the unstoppable force (or whatever that AV mace is called) is easy to access and a lot of squishies still don’t have amazing gear. But will get old and not even fun memeing in like 2-3 weeks of play. It wasn’t very strong in vanilla even with people back peddling and keyboard turning. I imagine it’d be hell now playing against people with appropriate latency and knowing how to move.
---
I’d probably only play it if I can get sexy gear and dark edge of insanity / hand of rag. And only for the satisfying moments when you one shot a mage.
---
Youre changing your story. Just like no PUG wants a bad prot warrior, no PUG wants a bad arms warrior. From what youve said its clear youre one of those bad pug dps. Pugs love my 2h tanking.
---
Go brutality mirah's...
---
1g
---
Well personally i think that rogue have the right of being assholes because is part of their fantasy
---
Well, it's part of the game, it's kind of implicit to the situation. It's a weird kind of kindness to turn down an honorable kill, similar to just playing a different game or moving to PvE out of some sort of mercy for those that you would have killed. The game has war in the title. It doesn't mean people don't care about the situation and want the game to be better for everyone (ie. balanced.) It's clear that most people would prefer more balance and want this addressed. So I would disagree with you on that level about no compassion. 
---
Though maybe I do agree on some level. I was ganked in undercity while doing my auctions. When others finally caught and killed the rogue, I corpse camped him. It's an interesting ethical situation, who is scummier in that situation, but we both had our reasons. It may be relevant that I am only level 29 (holy priest,) and he was a 60 rogue, but he didn't rez until I went back over to the auctioneer. I thought that he would probably try something due to my low level and it might be interesting.
---
I'm just about 275 Alch (lvl 53 War),  should I learn all the transmute recipes from vendors, namely Arcanite? And would that be the only one that sells / sells the best kinda thing? It's been a while :P
---
This. 24 days here almost full epic, I can win 1v1 against most classes, but that's not the case most of the time.
---
6/7 enjoyed it though
---
Drop enchanting like a bad habit. I've spent no less than 700G so far getting recipes, making the arcanite rod etc. and I haven't even seen 20% of my money back, nevermind a profit. 
---
Not to mention all the money you missed out on by not vendoring random greens/blues and DE-ing them instead. 
---
If I could go back to Lv1 I'd never pick it up knowing what I know now. Alas, I'm too invested now to drop it.
---
It seems to be very iffy. I can usually get it off, but often times they are allowed a spammed action in between. Generally it's something I'd save for a very safe 1v1 where you can maybe get around a corner or far away and do a soft reset without allowing them to heal etc. I often get the stealth off, but they either are able to swap forms, cast a blind/gouge of their own (during that phase-in-out time of stealth setting in) or blink etc. A lot of times I'll get into stealth, get the cheapshot off, only to also be in blind/gouge etc. It's very odd. Something is fucky with the spell batching in classic atm.
---
Oh man I’m really gonna miss ninja shroud and long gothalion!! Facebook?? KEKW
---
what addon for the chat
---
i went to rank 13 as an enchance shaman, it's perfectly viable but requires gear. Once you get TUF from AV and a bit of the ranking gear you'll see clearly. 
---
Engineering and trinket rotating is your friend, learn to purge , read when to grounding, use earthbind to kite / gap close, save shocks for the right moment.
---
Actually quest rewards are also a few levels below the quest level.   
---
Let's see what's in my log right now... Mai'Zoth. Tranquil Orb ilevel 43 (which translates to required level 38 if it were a BOE), from a level 46 quest.  
---
Cracking Maury's Foot: Collection Plate, required level 39, quest level 44.   
---
Keep an Eye out: Darktide Cape, level 37, quest level 42
---
Shadowshard Fragments, quest level 42, level of rewards: 37
---
and so on...  
---
What this does in theory is make crafting equipment viable. In reality there's too few pieces that are actually good (looking at all the +spirit crap on blacksmithing armor)   
---
Same for Dungeons, the loot there is a few levels below the actual encounter, this is sometimes offset by the blue quality, but in vanilla lots of green (and even white) crap is dropped by bosses all the way up to the 50s, when finally in scholo strat and blackrock this nonsense ends.   
---
Take for example Razorclaw the butcher in SFK, he's 22 (and you better be higher than him if you actually wanna finish the dungeon) yet he drops level 18 greens. Those are vendor loot 99% of the time.   
---
Electrocutioner 6000 is level 32 (and again, being at least that level is advised if you want to finish the dungeon), and he drops level 28 stuff. 
---
So yeah, fully gearing a level 35 character in level 35 greens makes for a pretty strong character.
---
Maybe his hearth is set to the local hub and he’s got a log full of complete quests
---
Of course you will think something is trash when you’re bad at it
---
The DPS output is higher when using Mirah's Song in the offhand. This can be seen on the spreadsheet but should also be fairly evident from the stats on each weapon.
---
Mirah's Song - 40 dps, +9 strength, +9 agility  
---
Bone Slicing Hatchet - 40.59 dps, +13 agility, +5 stamina
---
Mirah's Song has 5 more of the useful dps stats, strength / agility. Put differently, it has +9 strength and -4 agility compared to the bone slicing hatchet. But strength is worth a bit more than agility. And this amount of stats is worth more than the difference in weapon dps. This translates into the spreadsheet result that using Mirah's Song in the offhand does more dps.
---
population unarguably had a very strong shift in favor of alliance over the last 2 week.
---
as the OP said : on the first day BRM control swapped ten time over.
---
yesterday, a group of rogue where waiting in orgrimmar port-in cause horde barely leave their cities anymore.
---
You don't really farm gold until you're 60. A lot of warriors make gold by charging for tanking services. You can charge gold or you can say that you want all the unwanted blues. Can make a good amount this way
---
not advertise's fault asmon can't take being killed in a video game. especially after all the shit talking and bragging he's done about his guild. saying stuff like olympus runs the server and horde will only be allowed to farm if they let them. then when he gets beat at his own game he cries to twitch to get advertise banned. the irony of it all is amusing.
---
Because in the real world companies favor janitors over CEOs right?
---
20% is 20% no matter if its 1 big attack or few big attacks 
---
some things are per minute procs and slower weapon is better for that but i thought windfury was a real 20%
---
I did this in a guildie LBRS run for lolz. Well our priest just jumped while the rest of us were discussing where it could lead to, so we all followed the jump to ensure we don't get split up. Luckily we had enough CC to get rid of the pack of elites and eventually reach back to the BRS entrance. It was quite a fun moment and we were laughing nonstop on Discord.
---
1g. Highest I've ever gotten is 5g.
---
Thanks for actually supplying something concrete.  However, Grummz is Mark Kern.
---
Come to arcanite reaper. The alliance has a majority and does the same shitty things the horde usually gets blamed for. Including camping the roof of the org bank nightly after prime time.
---
This is obviously sarcasm
---
If you are serious about healing at 60, and PvE end-game content then I suggest to all Priest to flip heals at 55 to start working on your Pre-BIS rading gear. People who say you can heal as Shadow at 58, it might be somewhat true but 58+ content starts getting more dps/heal checkish.
---
You guys are kidding right?  
---
The Alliance quest chains, zones, and cities are significantly more fleshed out and in-depth compared to the Horde alternatives.  
---
This is because they basically tacked on the Horde content at the end after spending all the time designing the Alliance content.
---
tbh pvp was fun during vanilla, but this is not the vanilla days. Back then we had 2.5k realm caps, now we have about 10k on each server.
---
The power-hungry mods ruined the sub as expected.  They treat moderating a free public forum like a corporate HR organization trying to appease shareholders.  It's both baffling and incredibly sad.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-set/gear-actuals-21082
---
Here’s my gear. I don’t have T-1 bonus yet and I don’t have the biggest mana pool. So based on that would you suggest GHeal rank 1 Heal 3 and max rank flash heals?
---
for speaking common sense? can you disprove what i said?
---
Telleh.
---
Lmfao. I was about to say k and move on since 99% of people dont care about your server drama, but then I opened the pic and it was icemail jerkin of all things. Oh lord thank you for this laugh.
---
Exactly. We have 1 full set and start doing split runs with alts in the next week or 2. Bindings are still extremely rare and we got lucky with 1 set.
---
It will be worse than a PvE server.
---
Not really a surprise- when you're spending weeks stalking someone constantly, on any other medium but gaming you'd be seeing police involvement. Keep in mind what the guy did wasn't just gank Asmon a bunch- he was stalking.
---
If Asmon were a girl streamer, this discussion wouldn't even be happening because people would see it as clearcut stalking and harassment.
---
Now rule 63 that and ruin your life.
---
That's right... you don't know what cereal he likes, you don't know what op has been through!
---
Druid and warlock is a classic. In fact, when TBC comes around its going to be the meta for like the whole expansion.
---
twitch and youtube have been bad for videogames for almost a decade now.
---
Really? I disagree.  
---
Back in Vanilla days it was a lot easier to grind gold because far fewer people knew about the good gold farm methods (IE the Azshara essence of water farming).  
---
Now every single good gold farm method has a plethora of YouTube guides about it, and everything is farmed to shit.  
---
Not to mention just generic farming. Have you actually *seen* a Black Lotus in Classic WoW yet? Because I sure as shit haven't.
---
Thanks I’ll take a read of that. But Basically all the priests in my raid are flash healing. So I wasn’t sure if I should do the same or if I should stick to more mana efficient spells.
---
Oh yes, DM east requires mining. If your healer has it that's fine too, it would be nice if you have herbalism then because there's a bunch of good ones there as well.
---
we can beat that:  https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/6ncj1LkhmdYy4fbA#fight=1&amp;type=damage-taken
---
And Shaggy also came out with a song called, "Go Fuck Yourself."
---
Not even close to being balanced alliance population has surged in the past week
---
They think they do, but they don't.
---
Guys, it may be possible to play mage while driving, but I wasn’t so don’t worry
---
There's nothing wrong with flash healing in MC if your fights are short enough to never run out of mana this way. It will be an issue if everyone gets used to this playstyle, though.
---
the best thing about all of this is...
---
same thing happened on retail with BFA warmode.
---
and blizz had a solution for it ; dynamic sharding and faction-balancing.
---
granted, it wasn't perfect, but it's 20 times better than the situation on heartseeker-herod-stalagg and now earthfury...
---
And blizz did want to implement it in classic... but the QQ against sharding was too strong.
---
Fair enough...
---
It's abit wierd yeh. If you get a full set of gear at your level, you are essentially overleved for your activities lol. Don't get me wrong, it's super fun, but abit weird. A concept we aren't used to anymore.
---
If your guild needs loot council to get through MC, it's a trash guild. Classic has been made comically easy compared to pservers. Maybe BWL will change that but for right now, LC is idiotic
---
... so when I roll on arcane wrath gear for my arcane shot that’s a meme ? Fml
---
KromCrush!
---
Because look at where free transfers have gotten us...
---
I don't know if anyone else will read this, but that guy Telleh has a huge PvPenis. Good job last week bro.
---
In EvE other players payed for my game time via scams, espionage, befriending, completely abusing players incompetence and ignorance to fund my own wallet. Regardless of conscience. Without mercy and without remorse. Creating characters for the sole purpose of stealing money, acting friendly, or simply killing people when they feel safe. For isk (Eve gold)  
---
In wow. I worry if I need an item in RFC that I genuinely need. 
---
Was a big change.
---
To be fair, every prediction of you guys comming back within a month has a 90% chance of comming true. Not many people actually cares about the plight of others. People who quit usually have other reasons and Hong Kong just gave them their social justice out.
---
Advertise is my new favourite streamer
---
Just merge heartseeker with Herod, problem solved
---
Yeah I’m on Herod and I plan to basically just churn out Waters. 2000g by May 22nd 2020 is fine by me considering I’m literally raid logging my main at the moment. I have no plans to farm for gold, so having a steady stream of money coming in sounds nice. Plus, the first 3-4 weeks of BWL will require flask which as a Caster is like 600g (150g for Supreme Power last I checked), but we’re a ways from BWL at the moment.
---
Noted! Good catch :-)
---
Yeah, they basically ran out time before release and tacked on a bunch of "oh you big hunter, go kill xx # of these."
---
Quality is not quantity.
---
I would love being on a balanced server. I followed my guild to Heartseeker from Skeram. Given the choice of the two, I'm glad I'm on Heartseeker.
---
Just letting you know this is actually not true, youre not too invested unless you have multiple rare enchants. You're losing gold everyday you're not dropping it for something better that has actual use. The sooner you drop it the sooner you'll recoup your losses from the mistake and/or get something useful instead.
---
Honestly dude the 30m-1hr corpse walks killed my desire to play. I've just found more entertaining ways to waste time.
---
How does it hurt his destination server? No place needs less Alliance.
---
Awesome, thanks for this! I \[unfortunately\] felt I had to equip the edgemasters because they dropped in a dungeon run and everyone greeded to let me get them and I didn't want to be that guy, so I equipped them. Now I guess I can use them if I get a better wep that isnt an axe, I guess? Then again, it should be relatively easy to get those anyways... I'll probably just be sticking to axes. Shit, in hindsight, I wish I had sold / traded them for Flurry Axe!
---
Edit: Should I be aiming for Epic Mount prior to Flurry Axe? Or Vice Versa?
---
I personally don’t see the draw to it, it’s a status item that’s it.
---
It doesn’t make you better and you won’t use it outside of tanning in your capital.
---
of course you are lol, no wonder you are so blindly defending the stream sniper
---
You should read rule 3 of this sub... but hey, let’s all get that guy for his serious crime... jfc
---
Give shamans a taunt
---
Unfortunately I can't find a screenshot of the followup comment about the modern hardware, but it's not so farfetched to imagine it's at least four times as good as it was all those years ago.
---
😂😂😂 as if every single alli on heartseeker isn’t a reject that transferred off their initial realm to begin with. Let’s be real no one rolled on heartseeker it’s all just transfer rejects.
---
you faggot nigger kike.  Kill yourself Nazi mod.
---
Smaller guy punching up, asmon starts punching back but the punches dont faze the smaller guy so he had to get twitch
---
I play rogue on a pvp server and have 3 kills lol
---
Well if everyone uses an incoming heal addon no heals should be sniped in theory if nobody heals people already getting heals.
---
If you want to increase how fast you heal people trying using a quick cast addon like Clique. They are surprisingly easy to get used to.
---
I rolled RP-PVE because I've only ever played PVP and the last decade of Private servers was strictly PVP.
---
It's been interesting seeing the opposite faction just chilling there peacefully.
---
I saw this happen a couple of times while the horde was camping us just outside of southshore, I laughed and could only imagine the dread.
---
Your example literally wastes an SS to an auto attack. 
---
Warrior discord, join it.
---
I am done you sinply dont know what you are talking about.
---
Hear hear
---
Asmon did say pretty horrible things towards advertise
---
&gt; the gameplay perspective and its being carried entirely by it being a mmo and the nice feeling of doing things with other human beings.
---
Yess
---
thats insane
---
???? Dagger combat is on par with sword combat
---
Nope, 70% of warriors tanking end game 5 mans are just Arms/Fury warriors with no prot abilities.
---
I do have multiple rare enchants, that's the problem. I have Crusader, Lifestealing, Riding Skill, almost all the armor enchants except +7 Strength on gloves. 
---
Not getting the MC recipes though since I'm not the guild enchanter, so can't even do those for a bit of gold to make up for it.
---
You're talking about Rebirth like it's in your main rotation in every boss fight. It's a 30 minute cooldown used in situations where your guild/raid is failing, not powershifting because you might use it once every raid is dumb lol. Watch Shedo or any other top feral dps whos always top 10 in the raid and then come back and say powershifting is "a small dps increase". There is no way on earth you can get even close to those numbers without powershifting.
---
I think you might be right about Item Rack. Because it only started AFTER I downloaded the addon and I've had Deja for almost a month now. I only downloaded Item Rack around the same time it started happening.
---
And countless nerfs and fixes to several bosses. IIRC Rag's first kill only worked because he didn't always cast all of his abilities.
---
Check the patch history of dungeons especially. Strat, even as a 5man, used to be *way* more brutal. 1.12 is the easiest version of classic there is in several ways, and a somewhat less addon-intense version in several others (Decursive + healbot are fixed e.g)
---
I'm playing for the first time and I'm one of the better mages in my guild (raids and pvp). You just have to realize what your mistakes are and correct them. Then repeat.
---
Read about 6 times before checking the name
---
You are literally on the highest population EU server - what do you expect?
---
I mean you truly have to be a pathetic individual to make a career out of harrassing a fucking streamer, so not really surprising
---
look now...
---
Anywhere a list like this for rogue floating around?
---
good duel
---
Who is the tank
---
lol what the fuck are you talking about?   
---
I literally just gave my opinion on why fp camping is so common, and you've managed to twist that into me saying classic is ruined?  
---
I'm enjoying the shit out of classic, and never once said it's ruined. I said it's different, which it is. The only reason i mentioned something being ruined is that campers of the dominant faction are obviously ruining the lesser factions experience on pvp servers when they have to do 1 hour death runs to enter and instance or hand in a quest.
---
Maybe learn to read before you start jumping down peoples throats.

More fleshed out and in-depth quests doesn't mean they're equal.  Joana's Alliance leveling guide literally has a section in the mid-40s that is like "yeah go do some dungeons and/or grind a level, Alliance have fewer quests."
---
It's very close to a side upgrade. Even if gun clips with shots I'd say it's a tiny bit better than the crossbow, as it have abit more max damage as well as 1% crit.
---
Windfury is a real 20%, but your instant attacks also trigger windfury 20% of the time. So when you have an instant attack on a cooldown like whirlwind it's better for the flat 20% proc on that to trigger a swing from a slower weapon.
---
Why would you even want to ninja that
---
Naming and shaming isn't allowed bröther. Rule #3  
---
Yeah he's a dick, but the rules are there for a reason.
---
Lol u mad.
---
I hate your way of debating, always ending on how you think another person thinks. 
---
Anyways okay for the sake of argument we'll call specs "classes". How would dual spec but having to change in capital cities kill hybrids? This is coming from a druid. Even if you can switch from frost mage to fire mage, you still lack the flexibility to off heal off tank on the fly during a pull like a shaman or druid would.
---
Dude, yes, Fairbanks is a total shitshow. I noped out and rerolled PVE. Hoping for a transfer someday to rescue my stranded mage.
---
Thank you :)
---
It works! Haven't seen any buggy names so far again. Thank you very much!!
---
lol for someone old enough to have played vanilla, you sure act like a child.
---
Three comments, zero evidence.
---
Like I said, bullshit.
---
I don't have CHT yet and I don't really have much interest in farming muggers belt if I get CHT since the combo is only a 4 dps increase.
---
Out of all the things you had coming, you had this coming the most.
---
It's more about the buffs change, it won't detect players if they don't do anything and you don't mouse over them.
---
Well, to give him credit he is wearing the very best healing dress, outside of raids.
---
For someone who accuses others of "jumping down people's throats" you sure are aggressively insulting.
---
fake news, multiple raids/guilds riding together to save their buffs because searing gorge and brm are camped by alliance raids 24/7. wish i was recording, brm entrance was camped by alliance as always and mc npc was as well, even tho horde rode in like that alliance managed to kill a bunch and waste a lot of buffs for pve content.
---
So Asmon should be banned because members of his guild camped Advertise when advertise was streaming?
---
Can't read huh? Let me help you. 
---
&gt; Asmon got one of his guilds officers (Unbind) to lead a raid to camp Advertise for like 8 hours during one of his streams.
---
In this case "Him" means Advertise.
---
Lol, I knew someone was gonna say something!
---
You didn't understand that, and you don't understand this.
---
Its running from one side to the other, I don't bother going past the teleport location where the falls and the turtles are.  There are a couple mushroom spawns down that way but I can never be bothered and it seems inefficient.
---
Per run there are 3 mushroom spawns in purple, 2 in orange and one in the watery bit between orange and purple.
---
That doesn't mean people don't enjoy those specs and want to play them lol.
---
I've been past the instance portal a bunch of times (usually due to being instance capped), but there's an invisible wall a few feet behind it. Didn't know you can get feared past that, too :O
---
Nice argument mate, go drink some draino will ya.
---
With a few exceptions (mind blast/searing pain which deal threat equal to 200% of damage done) everything that causes a high amount of threat has a static threat value.
---
he didn't get banned for streamsniping.  The harassment clause in twitch TOS includes that word as an example but clearly you cannot extrapolate that beyond what is literally presented to you. 
---
so heres some help:  If you make a channel and all of the content relies on another streamer being online and your content is created in a manor that is disparaging to another streamer it is against the TOS. You do not need to streamsnipe to accomplish this. His behavior was 100% justifiable in a ban. Plus its fuckin 7 days, relax.
---
Precisely. I know that rank is not an indication of a players skill level, but I only roll solo or duo and I’ve managed to achieve that rank and I only play at night after work. Enhance can work, it’s just harder to make work than other classes. I’m just sick of everyone shitting on enhance and repeating the same stereotype.
---
I’m not gonna disagree that P2 has been a bit of a disaster for leveling because it has. But 2 hours a night is 1 BRD or LBRS run which will net you 1/4-1/3 a level depending on your level and rested exp. Which is about what someone questing would expect.
---
Forming a group is the real question, and that depends on your role and your servers population, which is why I recommended forfeiting your gold in drops to entice a tank/healer.
---
Not going to argue that the above is ideal, but hiding in dungeons does work, even on a tight schedule. You just have to be proactive about it.
---
where did 12k come from
---
Right? I love challenges and setbacks.
---
nah. his videos got very popular so he recruited shitton of people from comment section or whatever and made a massive guild. he didn't played with like 90% of his gulls before prob
---
Only for alliance. Might change with BWL
---
"Sounds like targeted harassment to me.  I guess Asmon should also be banned."
---
Thats what I replied to. Moron
---
Ahh, didn’t know if the extra time you had per hour was worth it to go down there for those. But it’d make resets a bother with needing the friend/alt setup.
---
Then, again, he must be bad. No chance in current gear a warlock should be losing to a warrior.
---
I love seeing the 1.8k crits against tanks.
---
me too. probably because i spelled out yesterday wrong once and it adds it to the phone's dictionary
---
Ah yes glad to see another autist at work, carry on
---
40 mans are trash honor, saw tons of 3-5 man alliance groups in felwood, feralas, and winterspring. Smart Alliance just avoid searing gorge because it's not worth forming big groups to combat the horde mongoloids in bigglesworth.
---
He said 25% extra damage noch 25% procc rate.
---
He also doesn't understand the concept of what a change is. Blizzard already changed it by allowing bigger server pops then what was ever intended. Obviously this jacks of the player density in each zone, amplifying the effects of server imbalance exponentially.
---
But of course people like him will mindless jump on the #nochanges meme since functional thought is an issue for people lately.
---
Do you have a link to the thread?
---
You are the reason why we still have to put /s's on elementary grade sarcasm
---
&gt; You should have googled "what is the best race to play on a pvp server" and followed any youtubers advice. Then you could turn PvP servers into dead pve servers like the rest of us
---
Like jesus bro lol
---
so in 2019 harassing means killing in a video game. I guess south park will soon be able to fire their writers, why even bother.
---
I know this isn't your argument but personally I like the alliance questing experience far more than the horde one. It's a lot more story driven and that appeals to me.
---
Hot take: There's lots of well itemized gear that you can wear that just *happens* to have FR on it. Wearing that kind of gear will only make Vael easier; Fully and partially resisting his fire nova every now and then will keep your raid alive, and you can *still* wear strong gear.
---
Stuff like Black Dragonscale and several decent tierpieces, Ony neck etc. happen to have FR on them; asking your raid to wear and collect stuff like that isn't absurd, it's logical.
---
Whether the number 100 is feasible for any and every spec could be pretty easily checked, and it's a bit arbitrary I guess, but alas.
---
We are getting WSG and AV on the 10th of December 2019.
---
I have a shadow reflector.
---
It kills hybrids specs. Hotw is gone, prot/fury combo builds are gone. It will be just like retail where everyone does everything. You no longer have a prot warrior who has an advantage over people trying to juggle both because no everyone can do everything. I'm not talking about someone switching up in between fights, why is that even relevant? 
---
The entire point of this is OP acting like it changes nothing to add this feature, it clearly does change that for some. This is not about your opinion vs my opinion and has nothing to do with how i think another person thinks OP literally asked why the people against dual spec are against it and here i am laying out why i am against it.
---
I wouldn't know, as he blocked me months ago for saying that Vanilla wow was never hard and he lives too much in the past 🤷
---
I hope he gets better though, legitimately. I know he was having some mental issues before.
---
There have also been several threads where horde were favored, a recent one comes to mind where someone leveled on Horde and Alliance to 60 and to sum it up came to the conclusion that questing as horde was much easier and more convenient than alliance.
---
I do think starter zones are nicer for alliance, but for the vast majority of the leveling process it seems more convenient as horde. Orgrimmar is central and theres a well protected zeppelin right outside which takes you ti eastern kingdoms in no time.
---
In the grand scheme it doesnt really matter and I realize arguing about it is pretty dumb lol.
---
I would agree with this about most of the things people ask for  but reducing the cooldown on ony head turn in would be very easy  this isn't modifying a game system or anything it's just changing a parameter to make the head expire quicker.
---
I picked the highest pop server that wasn't "full" at launch, enjoying 55-45 faction balance. Razorgore btw.
---
Why is he doing it by that tree he can conveniently hang himself from?
---
He's no longer raiding with us anymore, but when we looked at the logs, he was doing...nothing. He was just standing there.
---
Still having issues I see, ok no problem. I'll lay it out for you in smaller chunks. Twitch wrong. Asmongold bad. You are stupid.
---
Looks cool, is a 2.9 swing time, 47.2dps, and a decent proc. Sinister strikes are based off your weapon damage, so slower weapons mean higher SS hits, and it's roughly 7dps higher than dal'rends so yeah rogues love this shit.
---
Taking the piss is slang for making fun of something. It’s mostly used in the UK, Australia, NZ.
---
@nightstalker314 get absolutely shiton
---
Yes, the Core Hound Tooth is a very good offhand and makes buying a Flurry Axe a waste of money if you can get the +5 dagger weapon skill from the Aged Core Leather Gloves. There might also be some value in gear swapping to use the Mugger's Belt in the interim (especially if you don't have Onslaught yet).
---
You mentioning 90% reminded me of my uncle telling me about something he called the 90/10 rule when we were have a beer. He is a big python guy has done some talks at conferences. But if my memory serves me right it boiled down to this. 
---
90% of the time you use 10% of your code and 10% of the time you use the other 90%. So you will want the 10% of your code that is used 90% of the time to be written it a low level language maybe not assembly but the lower the better.(So it can run fast?) Then the 90% of your code that is used 10% of the time you want written in a higher level language since it is easier to write in and read/comment and this 90% should be where the majority of the changes to the code happen in the future.
---
ok zooomer
---
Since you don't understand things very well, what I'm saying is people are people wherever you go. People that play WoW aren't worse than people playing other games, they're just people, like all other people.
---
Apologies, it is the 11th in my time zone....
---
The transfer servers are all alliance dominated
---
Someone bought one for 12.5k on my server.
---
"I totally changed the way i give money to Blizzard, that'll show them to respect human rights."
---
Yes, most of your damage comes from Heroics and Melee, but that doesn't mean that BT isn't your #1 priority ability. You should be using it on CD with 0 downtime on it and only using Heroics as a rage dump. All I've been saying in this thread has been that pure melee stats are more impactful than weapon damage. Getting your Savage Glad, Lionheart, and other pre bis items will be a bigger boost to dps over just getting a Viskag.
---
Some people are just bad.
---
I went though an instance with a tank who opened with Taunt and relied entirely on Heroic Strike.  Ran another one with a tank who didn't know what stances were.  Ran several with different tanks who never switched targets and never did anything to build threat on mobs they weren't attacking, so they'd all aggro on healer as soon as he dropped a couple heals.
---
Bruh. His entire stream
---
Is about targeting the guy and killing him. How is that not harassment lmao
---
At least hide your rogue flair when you say that 😂
---
yup. If you went on his stream there were way too many people in chat getting away with saying rather derogatory things directed at Asmongold. Advertise should have known better about letting that stuff happen in chat.
---
I don't even have my epic mount lol. That's insane.
---
Sums up being horde on Herod after 7pm trying to do ubrs. Morning/Afternoon = horde hours. Nights = allis mountain
---
That's fair, of course it comes down to personal preference. And yeah, I'm not trying to argue which is "nicer" per say, which is what a lot of people seem to think
---
Will remember this for wow classic classic launch
---
That was the one I was looking for. Thanks. As a 67 year old man it is difficult to keep up these days!
---
Its from the movie full metal jacket. Basically boot camp made the bald guy crazy, and he uses his beloved gun to kill the srgt.
---
Bro....it's 1 alliance server...8 horde servers.... Don't act like it's even... It's not....so STFU with your bull shit
---
Well I bought the Flurry Axe a long time ago but then eventually we got the gloves and dagger to drop for myself during our raids. Was just always a question in the back of my mind if I should still be using CHT when I could be getting 2 more % hit from the full Devilsaur set + Flurry Axe. Thank you for the words though, I'll keep using my dagger and gloves :)
---
Yes, but it's still your #1 priority ability is what I'm saying. If you don't use it on CD because you Heroic Strike too much, you will lose dps.
---
Decent gear. Two thoughts for improvements
---
GHeal Rank 1 Flash Heal 5, Heal 3.
---
Replace the Elegant Circlet.
---
pri-BIS weights + Healing way to high, I argue that Int is more important to have at lower gear levels and have found success giving some of it up a larger mana pool. Fights over 1.5 m you will struggle to compete will pally heals.
---
When you title your stream “watch me fuck worhstreamer x” how is that not harassment. I get it you he asmon but these logical leaps you have to make to justify that hate are hilarious.
---
just You.
---
\*Cracks knuckles\*
---
First of all, it's about gear and spec. If you have zero AP/strength/agility gear, you will do 0 threat. Period. Even Sunder Armour was changed to have an attack power component for TBC onwards but way too many tanks forget the most important, \*basic\* thing about Sunder; It Costs Rage.
---
Rage requires you to hit things, activate bloodrage or put talents into another skill to enable it to generate Rage.
---
When you pull, you're usually relying on "front-loaded" rage from Charge or Bloodrage and have a very small, limited amount to spend wisely before you need to rely on being hit or hitting enemies for more rage.
---
This is where the gap between a bad tank and a great tank starts to show.
---
A \*great\* tank will usually use thunderclap or demoralising shout \*immediately\*. Both are spells, both reduce the amount of damage the tank takes and both are subsequently very high threat moves. For a single hard hitting enemy/boss they will then shield block as they \*want\* to soak that first hit, FOR RAGE. They may even pot just so they can survive a second hit if they're undergeared, knowing fully well that they won't survive a 2nd even while blocking \*unless\* they use a health pot.
---
A \*great\* tank will have cleave macro'd to all their active skills, so when they have enough rage they can apply a sunder AND toggle on cleave for their next swing.
---
A \*great\* tank will even have most of their damage gear on, while tanking trash mobs if they can do so safely, so their higher AP/Crit allows them to generate more rage and more threat. Going from 40 to 60% mitigation is pointless if your healer was bored and never heals you in most trash pulls in the first place.
---
Seriously, I can't stress this enough, do not overload on tanking gear when you don't bloody \*need\* it.
---
Long story short it all comes down to rotation, priority and \*gear\*. Over 90% of bad warriors are inefficient because they have too little threat or too little mitigation.
---
Find a balance between threat and mitigation.
---
The remaining 10% are simply lazy and refuse to get their skill priority correct.
---
The Alliance questing experience 20-60 is without a doubt much more cohesive and straight forward as Alliance. If you do some zones too early as Horde and don't do some dungeons/grinding you can find yourself in a weird spot with very very few quests 30-50
---
So three comments, zero evidence.
---
7 downvotes for asking an evidence (pathetic).
---
Mmmm light day at the flight points I see.
---
I have to ask does the Alliance have a kargath like hub? We get so much ganking at kargath from alliance suicide attackers. They rush in kill some AFKs get honor respawn kill the next few AFks they see. 
---
A lot of horde just hangs out at kargath cause of BRM etc... No rela guards. I can't think of anything the alliance has like that that isnt a large city. If anyone can fill me in on a place similar to that please let me know... Asking for a friend ha ha &gt;.&gt;
---
Grobbulus is very very even
---
Not when it comes to Twich. Plenty of streamers get x day "bans".
---
Earthshaker is great!
---
You know you can just upvote instead of saying them right?
---
I’m pretty sure there’s only one horde flight point in desolace
---
Why not Flash Heal rank 1? It seems more mana efficient to me.
---
Also would like to see the sauce
---
I disagree with your first point. The reason retail classes suck is because they were homogenized. You can do everything now by your logic, it just costs 50g to do it every time. All this does is takes a gold sink away from the game and opens up the ability to fill more roles, especially during off peak hours where it might be hard to find a tank or healer.
---
This is gold, needs more exposure!
---
Just here to say that it will get better.  I can sympathize.  I just had a complete shoulder replacement 100 odd days ago (motorcycle accident, 5 broken bones)  and am just now being able to use a mouse.  Hang in there!!!!
---
CALLED OUT
---
Smart alliance is an oxymoron. If they were smart they would make groups to combat the horde, or at least stop crying about being killed by horde on a goddamn pvp server.
---
Horde probably just don't understand that when there is roughly an equal amount of Alliance player that equates to balance.  
---
OP probably just landed in EPL didn't see a 40 man raid camping the flight master and decided to cry about it.
---
Its elvui, I added the extra tabs though.
---
This really isn't true. We get A LOT Of rogues and druids that sneak on those zepplins and gut people. On Faerlina it gets so bad that I took my warlock got my felhound out chugged catseyes and opened up the Zepplin Protection Force. Where I find the rogues dot em up and let people kill them before they kill us. Cause holy shit do they go to town on people with the zepp.
---
The guy constantly calling for mass PvP with his empty bullshit phrases should never face what he is calling for? And by now he is just a random pleb getting run over in World PvP. If he doesn't like to die in World PvP he should just quit it. No matter which so called stream sniper I watch they aren't singling him out. He and his entourage get picked apart no matter what.
---
Well, "basement dweller" carries with it a certain expectations how the person is or lives. He defies some of them (caring for his mom), but he also fulfils some of them. That's what I wanted to point out.
---
Ah no problem lol why the downvotes?
---
I swear this wow sub is for those perfect snowflakes to complain about their experiences in wow but most people who read these story's see them as.    Stupid as hell.    
---
I see why OPdeleted lol.   You cry ninja over a 8-20gold item Just get.over it and move on dude.
---
no rogue is super easy to play you can literally kill people with two buttons if you time everything correctly.
---
Duskwood is the best PVE zone in the game for quests. Its the one thing I wish the horde had more quests in because it is an amazing zone atmospherically and just adventure wise.
---
It doesn’t matter how good this item is think of the flex when you’re the only player in the world to have it
---
Seriously the best buddy comedy ever. Change my mind.
---
I'm defo in the discord, and still nothing of pooling rage. Lol
---
Probably a hood time to start. You wont be fighting over spawns in low level areas
---
inb4 guild master is a ret paladin
---
No idea. Any thoughts (re: my question) if double xp/honor/rewards will exist from the 10th?
---
But who's on first?!?
---
We have a healer in our raidgroup called 'Or'. It gets confusing when you do healing assignments: "SuperHealerX is on tank A, or on Tank B."
---
I do get the issue 100%. 
---
I play on two high pop realms. 
---
I've leveled two characters to 60 before the honor patch. 
---
Those areas were never too crowded, which means that most players you're complaining about were not engaging in wpvp. They were either not logged in, or hanging out and doing other stuff entirely. 
---
Now it's "too much" pvp on a pvp server? 
---
Evem of tje player populations were smaller, you're still fucked if you want to level in any of the leveling zones. There's not a lot of zones for you to go to when you reach 50+. 
---
It just sounds to me that bitching about "too many players" is a scapegoat that doesn't address the actual problem you are facing. It ***feels*** like a good excuse to harp on, I am sure.
---
What you're facing is a highly organized, mobile, and informed player base. On a game that is 15 years old and is considered a "known game". 
---
This is what happens when you take a game like Classic and make no changes.
---
Looking at you, “mages”...
---
Lol @ most guilds. You mean like the top &lt;5% of raiding guilds. Sure, maybe BWL+, but MC/Ony it literally doesn't matter. If youre having trouble in MC or Ony it 100% isnt because you have Arms warriors lol.
---
I don't believe so. At least not as far as any announcements regarding rewards of any sort.
---
Asmongold stopped being interesting years ago. His embellished character of 'yeah fuk it dood!!' went out the window along with, what, Warlords? Shame that he's hitched himself to this classic crew where the only genuine dude is Staysafe and even that is a stretch.
---
Classic isn't a good game to stream long-term, and I think a lot of people are waking up to that. It's possible, but just not interesting and engaging enough for an audience.
---
go in at like 4am or something ...
---
Double exp won’t and never will for Classic
---
Molten...core...
---
I mean it’s pretty dumb to use mortal strike when there’s raid devices that benefit more than half the raid, but keep thinking what you want.
---
Sorry, not sorry &lt;3
---
Yeah but also who the fuck summons themselves?
---
Lmao what? What kind of mental gymnastics are you doing to convince yourself of this? 
---
Advertise is a streamer. He was streaming. He got camped by a group of people that Asmongold told to camp him.
---
Asmongold is a streamer. He streams. He gets camped by a group of people that Advertise organizes.
---
Advertise was banned for HARASSMENT, not stream sniping. There is no more proof that Advertise stream snipes Asmongold than there is that Asmongold's raid that camped him was stream sniping Advertise.
---
Advertise literally does what you say isn't against the any ToS. It's very easy to find someone in Classic using in-game methods.
---
&gt; Hard to blame these guys for taking advantage of the systems given to them.
---
No it's not lmao. I do it every day.
---
I think I see both sides since I play both factions now and played Horde in Vanilla. I'm sympathetic to Alliance now because crazy population size has seriously hampered the Phase 2 experience-constant FP camping and a near unplayable game just didn't happen like this in Vanilla. Server caps just wouldn't allow for it on this level.
---
I think they are now, but they used to be active in the box
---
wait what? Blizz put 1000x more effort into alliance quests and leveling zones than they did horde.  Also alliance has better planned citys and they get an advantage in AV with their bunkers being much tougher to take than horde towers plus the bridge defense
---
Being a rogue doesn’t make me immune from roaming bands of people, in fact, BG’s being out would be more beneficial as I could get more solo kills on unsuspecting people.
---
Mods must be asleep
---
yikes, secondhand cringe af
---
It's not private server meta because private servers weren't stupid enough to do pvp system without BGs lol
---
Yeah. But I'm not trying to WPvP. Im trying to get to Theramore so I can go quest in Un'goro.
---
See the problem?
---
These "Just get a group together and fight them" answers are starting to actually piss me off.
---
If it wasn't for youtube and twitch's social power, classic likely would not exist. So there is that.
---
They hold one part of brm while horde has searing gorge, burning steppes and the instance portals
---
Mograine EU? I've seen sneakysnack before.
---
Ah, I see the Horde cannot win a 1 vs 1. How pathetic.
---
I mainly use normal heal downranked.
---
Fights are so quick that mana is no problem so of course I also use flashheal but that has nothing to do with sniping. I love greater heal but rarely use it in raids. It has its place but in our two hour molten core clears I use other spells
---
That's how it shows up on temp bans too if I'm not mistaken.
---
We actually managed to go inside beside the flight master and they completely ignored us
---
Show me an example of asmon harassing another streamer.
---
I would definitely recommend this. It may feel weird at first but once you get used to it I've found that I have more control over my character in more intense situations than I would strictly using WASD (I have better timing using my abilities since I dont usually have to worry about movement as much with my left hand). This is how I normally play. 
---
My condolences to you and your partner, but I'm very glad that it didn't turn out more severe. I have been in similar circumstances before and WoW is a good time sink in times like these!
---
SHHHH as a horde player you are not allowed to talk about alliance doing the same shit that they complain about horde doing
---
Ah, the communities standard "blame blizzard" response - fantastic.
---
Not really worth it, atleast on my realm since you can get Earth to water from timbermaw hold friendly.
---
It's only a 4 gold difference. It would take like a year to get  the 1k investment back
---
I think another part of it is that a lot of professional streamers curate themselves to an insane degree.
---
They have their camera focused on wall full of handpicked sponsored Geeky™ merchandise while sitting on a sponsored gaming chair, and playing with their sponsor's gaming mouse and keyboards wearing their sponsor's t-shirts, drinking from their sponsor's drink cups and showing off their perfectly coifed hair in the latest trendy style and they come in two varities: hopping from popular game to popular game week-by-week or sticking to one singular game and sucking that game's dev's dicks non-stop.
---
Then you've got asmongold whose room is a complete mess and he shows up on stream looking like hell, dressing like its his day off, and playing the same game that he'd be playing anyways.
---
And that lack of curation helps both foil and accentuate his "dumbassery" act.
---
Correct.
---
Noone ever brings up asmon bringing political messages into my fantasy game. Is it okay cause freehongkong is the fotm?
---
Are you Stupid? Stupid is my guild leader's name and all he's been doing is SFK runs lately
---
The mean is from the movie Full Metal Jacket, the soldier has gone berserk is about to kill his drill sergeant with the loaded weapon he has in barracks.  I am dating my age j guess.  I saw this on theatrical release.
---
stomp
---
what addon is that tells you when enemy rogue used blade flurry ?
---
I parry-tanked a majordomo add for the win as a PUG last week.  
---
pls giff recognition.
---
Advertise has said it is a 7 day suspension.
---
I used to play horde and I'm so glad I rolled ally this time around, embarrassed to have ever been apart of that amalgamation of low-skill / high effort / high volume shit smeared on azeroth
---
Is there any viable warlock tank specs for either dungeons or raids? I love the idea of a warlock tank.
---
We don't even have to look at private servers. Blizz implemented new rewards for wpvp in BfA, the latest expansion. People were spawncamping flightpaths, dungeon entrances etc. there already.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/0140003-50505013000201-05502310131
---
what do you think about this one? I do like entangling roots, and it is nice for pinning down people in the field, however I find I use feral faerie fire religiously. I don't want to give it up if possible. Especially when fighting rogues or warriors it's nice to be able to cast this without having to shift out and expose one's self to harm. What are the pros and cons in your experience?
---
There really shouldnt be more than 2, one for each melee group.  That's absolute maximum though, most guilds only have 1.
---
Currently our guild, which isnt that hardcore, has 4 healing shammys and myself as the Enhance bro.
---
3! For that classic feel at 4K!
---
please tell me how do u level 1-45 without going into a pvp zone as horde, because 1k needles and stonetalon are both pvp zones and i cant imagine going 20-30 without going into them.  Im sure for 30-40 you are talking about farming SM but that is a boring shitty way to level
---
Mine too! I can't wait for him to come back.
---
We just did Ony first and ~1 hour later it seemed like half the guilds gave up, so Blackrock was completely lagfree.
---
And Who’s on First is now a warcrack bit.
---
So are you horde or alliance?
---
please check your DM's
---
I looked but couldn't find it.
---
How do I get a faction/class icon next to my name? 
---
[Alliance/warrior]
---
How do I live this life that needs no money?
---
I saw a gnome the other day called Anklebiter and a shammy in the guild is called Orcamedies hah
---
Unable to quest doesn’t mean he’s saying people are ahead of him
---
I love GH but in a raid situation people get so much damage that you cant wait until someone drops so low. If a rouge suddenly gets low from 100% you can't cast a GH he will die. In 5 man's GH is great and it can be used in raids but there I like to heal with a downranked normal heal instead and the occasional pw:s + flash inbetween
---
Do you have a link to that spreadsheet or discord?
---
Its crap honor there is no reason to do it when you can farm horde in other zones
---
That's not what his ban is about, but go off.
---
Have patience. A warrior literally 4v1 (not everyone at the same time but in quick succession without using bandages) me and 3 randoms yesterday, I was in complete awe
---
&gt; I mean it’s pretty dumb to use mortal strike when there’s raid devices that benefit more than half the raid
---
I mean, it's even more dumb to waste 100g/week respecing pve to pvp when that single debuf slot makes no difference in your MC/Ony clear times. Especially when most guilds are memeing/gambling throughout and still clearing it all in under 2 hours.
---
I've been agreeing since literally my first comment. The point I've been making is that this is not going to change, it's not a trivial change, and it's not going to change (repeating just to make sure you get it.)
---
But sure honey, other than my whole argument I agree with you wholeheartedly. Xx
---
Looks good. Can this be done to any video?
---
Haha how did you get all that out of me insinuating you're a bit thick? Like im genuinely curious lol, please elaborate
---
Not trolling but there’s videos of ppl setting up eye tracking. You could allocate particular zones of your screen once you’ve tracking mapped it to key binds. Lots of tutorials on YouTube. Just need a webcam.
