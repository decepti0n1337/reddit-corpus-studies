Just curious - what bosses are rogues skipping to? I have rolled a rogue to 60 and can‚Äôt remember doing that for any dungeons. Maybe the BRD boss that has the Barman Shanker? Can‚Äôt think of any others.
---
---
---
90% sure that if THAT is what you got from the OP that you are definitely part of the problem.
---
Wow thank you for the awesome advice.
---
After you sure?
---
Isn't it a vendor in Winterspring that only has a certain number available at a given time?
---
All I see in trade chat is rogues and druids doing carry runs for loot
---
You got wrecked, son.
---
cope
---
And then what? Meet some human rogue in the inn basement or something? Or a naked night elf hunter and just /trade?
---
No, unless your friendly neighbourhood Blacksmith just so happened to pay 75 g for it and you have the mats.
---
I actually had that back in classic, too. 
---

---
It doesn‚Äòt make the run faster, but it makes the run easier since you usually built more threat.
---
Of course this means you are NOT just pulling everything at once, and it means using cc. And no going into the dungeon when you are 3+ levels below the boss.
---
Stops working after sunken temple, but for all those leveling dungeons it‚Äòs a viable option to the good warriors.
---
I feel better knowing that it's a common and easy mistake to make. I'm also glad that I didn't send some raging messages and make the mistake even more embarrassing!
---
Doesn't exist for the most part in retail.  
---
Cause no one actually talks in retail.
---
There are hardcore guilds on every server that raid or farm every night. Avoid those unless you are able to play Wow as a 'job'.
---
There are plenty of guilds with 2-3 raid days, usually a 3-4h session in the evening.
---
If your class is overrepresented you might only get a subset of the total weekly raid days anyway.
---
Initially it might take your guild 2-3 runs to clear MC, eventually you clear MC and kill Onyxia the same night, clear BWL the second and third. 
---
At some point in a couple of months your raid will do MC with 15 mains that still need something....and 20 twinks or friends that are not in your regular raid, even fill the ranks through LFM.
---
So even for the most casual there will be a time in the future where he can kill Rag and Onyxia
---
the bad ones do. Also, the bad tanks can't tank.
---
F in 3 months when you lose a freezing band to a ninja
---
Cool
---
Generally you go to a sketchy website, pay $5-7/g then they'll mail it, or you place an item on the AH and they buy it like a stack of silk cloth for 40g or something
---
Pretty easy for blizzard to track, gets difficult when you sell 67x 1 silk cloth for like 60s each which while expensive isn't unheard of
---
[Vanilla's patch notes from launch (1.0) to 1.12](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759436454)
---
Dungeons, Raids nerfed
---
Items buffed
---
Classes buffed
---
I'm not saying 1.12 is retail easy, but it's significantly easier than early vanilla. Not to mention class balance in 1.12 was "better" than launch class. Warlock was a fucking joke in early vanilla in PvP especially.
---
You didnt get any attention 2h ago so you repost little Timmy? :(
---
Combination of AoE grinding and optimized questing route.
---
You are doing it right. Coc before nova is for solo aoe grind without speccing shatter, since you dont want to break nova before blizzard. Shatter is such strong talent all around otherwise, especialy in aoe groups since you will most likely chain novas with other mages. After experiencing like all mixes of classes in dungeon groups at 60, id never drop shatter. Altho i highly recommend to partner it with permafrost and threat dump talents (esp as solo mage in a group), this way you can dump your combo shortly after pull, even if u precast flamestrike without breaking agro most of the time, and even if u do most are moving very slowly so its easy for tank to reagro

---
Unless your raid only has like 3 priests.
---
Almost nobody had T3 going into BC from Vanilla.  Maybe one or two pieces, maybe...  QA40 gear sure (sans C'Thun which most people couldn't finish), but Nax was out for about 6 months before BC hit, and there were very few guilds that could clear that either.  It took a couple months before top guilds actually cleared it and by Sep/Oct nobody was even trying anymore because BC was coming.  So, my point is that very few people ever even saw the inside of Nax until Wrath, and practically no one had T3.
---
My tatic in PvP was to morph the hunter and kill the pet. Has worked okay for dules honestly. Probably would be better the other way though now that I think of it.
---
I play MHW on PS4...but I haven't even purchased Iceborne yet because Classic is taking up all of my personal time! First world problems!
---
Longer wait with the slower weapon, but you did more damage to make up for it.
---
If two weapons have the same DPS, the slower weapon will always have done more damage, because it did the damage first.  (Barring special abilities, of course).
---
You had me going in the first half, not gonna lie
---
&gt;Only when publicly called out it seems... why do we never see a post ‚Äúi got wronged by GM, I submitted report and got apology and GM fixed my issue!‚Äù Type of posts? This is fandom, those posts would get upvoted way up. 
---
I think it's unfair to automatically make negative assumptions regarding this case when Blizzard has always been known for good CS. Myself and many others I know have had game time refunded for inactivity and even in game compensation for inconveniences/bugs. I even have one friend who sold his account as a dumbass in highschool and was able to get it merged in to his current account almost eight years later. Now the ethics of that are certainly questionable, as he claimed to be the victim of a hack, but no one had used the account since he sold it and I think it definitely speaks in favor of Blizzard CS.
---
Actually I went a variation of this, but I think leveling as ass/sub is awful in most cases. I made my own combat daggers build and run a dagger main (slower hard hitting) and a sword in my off, I've out DPSed every rogue in dungeons and don't struggle in many situations. I'm level 50 now but not slowing down yet.
---
dont worry that is the second time the first time is after 8 years of expansions
---
how's hunter leveling? I hear low downtime, but how easy is it? do i need to buy food/water often?
---
would have*
---
Yeah! It was Adriennes on Mankirk :)
---
nothing. they're just salty that they grind dungeons at half the xp/hour compared to spell cleave groups.
---
Spell cleave sux, yea I do it I main a mage. And some times it‚Äôs the only available group. It is a fast efficient effective way to get xp nothing more if done right.  Tho I would prefer ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú groups.
---
Heartseeker. First day it has been high pop üòÑ
---
with 2 decent mages, tank is not necessary.
---
I know what multi-boxing is, but no idea how this is normalizing multi-boxing
---
The Rivenspike debuff does not Stack with faerie fire. So its only really good as long as you have no druid in your raid. the annihilator procc does Stack with faerie fire though
---
Sometimes I join a party as DPS and let them spam for 10 minutes looking for a tank for an instance I tanked right before joining. Its a lot of fun I just have to be up for maintaining a high level of focus. Some times i just wanna stand behind things and punch them.
---
I forgot about that sword... the grind back in the day was real
---
your paladin privilege is talking.
---
I get this occasionally when my nets being slow. Just wait until it‚Äôs not peak traffic so the battlenet interface loads right and it‚Äôll work.
---
https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/08/27/wow-classic-realm-population/
---
Not sure where you got your info, but that's simply not true. Feel free to give that a read if youd like it explained
---
Also you apparently have to warn windows before you install a new mobo, who knew. It's a pain in the fuck to get your key reinstated if you don't have a CD key. Mine was a free upgrade from 8-10 so fuck if I know what my windows 8 key is from a decade ago
---
Some company hires out gold farmers to work for very cheap (usually 3rd world), gold farmers kill trash mobs/skin/solo dungeons/do whatever for raw gold, mail/trade gold to a stockpile account, company sells off stockpile accounts' gold (usually multiple of them).
---
Or the companies will just buy gold from players then resell it to other players at a higher price.
---
Back in the day, they'd just hijack accounts, but most people have authenticators now, so that probably isn't happening that often.
---
Okay how the fuck do pets work with the GMCC? I mind control things/people and I don't see any option to make them do anything. Is there some settings I need to check to have a pet action bar?
---
Yeah, i'd hate to be a mage or warrior once you hit end-game. Fighting over raid gear is going to be a huge pain while other classes basically get gear fed to them for not being meta. I think there's gonna be a lot of undergeared mages that eventually dont get played anymore after a while.
---
Sounds like total bullshit.
---
Lvl 40 mount is easy if you avoid levelling you crafting, have gathering professions and only buy talents you need. I am now lvl 57 and been super frugal as well as got some lucky BoE drops that I sold and have 350g so I would say fresh 60s with epic mounts is far more telling.
---
Even still, just level arms and keep a sword and board and learn your prot skills and you can do decent enough to get by most of the time.
---
They'll be back. 
---
For when they do, here's some tips to help fight bed bugs:
---
‚Ä¢They feed off of human blood. Slovenliness has nothing to do with them. Don't feel stigmatized.
---
‚Ä¢They can go without eating for 18 months. So forget about trying to starve them out.
---
‚Ä¢They like to live in the cracks and joints of wooden furniture/moldings, and under that little round ledge that runs around a mattress.
---
‚Ä¢They can't climb metal. Get your bed up off the floor onto a metal frame.
---
‚Ä¢"Sleep tight; don't let the bed bugs bite." is actually instructional. It means 'tuck your covers in so the bed bugs can't crawl up into your bed'.
---
‚Ä¢Extreme cold kills them. Freezing items will kill any bed bugs.
---
‚Ä¢Extreme heat kills them. Wrap stuff in a black trash bag and put it in the back of your car in the summer for a few weeks. 
---
‚Ä¢Direct hits of rubbing alcohol kills them. Put in a spray bottle and spray the cracks and joints of any wooden objects you want to keep. This should kill any inside the cracks/joints.
---
Good luck.
---
100%
---
Ah duh the rogue Druid combo makes total sense.
---
You're right. WoW is so super serious.    Gotta play by the made up rules so everyone will like me !!!
---
no it's not. spell cleave in classic predominantly means 3 mages. not just for AoE damage, but also for total control of the pull.
---
I lost an aurastone hammer to a 58 shaman :/
---
Report to win confirmed, we all work for Blizzard now.
---
I appreciate you shedding light on it! Like I mentioned finding info on this is tough especially as most of us never played on private servers! Thanks for adding on to this :)
---
Druids generate way higher ST theat
---
A lot of the hardcore players will:
---
A. Continue playing for phase 2 honor.
---
B. Continue playing to have an edge when BGs come.
---
C. Re-sub when BGs come.
---
A lot of players will be upset with the "slow" release, but it's definitely not a bad business move.

This has always been my experience since I started playing all those years ago and I've played both factions, horde will play friendly and then attack you the moment they have any kind of advantage.
---
I am now on a heavy horde server as an alliance and got sick of being rushed by 5 or more horde all the time, re-rolled rogue and try to 1 shot any horde I see regardless of whether they are 10 levels higher or lower, been having a great time ever since.
---
I'm probably on a few hit lists by now.
---
Again, a pretty pathetic strawman, but you do what you need to do buddy. Looks like you can't help but be a prick in general conversation, too. Almost like it's some kind of trend.

Yeah so they were being stupid and deserved it. It kinda sucks that some people can no longer say Naga on Twitch but get angry at the idiots who use it as a racial slur not the people enforcing the new rule.

DUDE ARE YOU ON BIGGLESWORTH?!? I think that was me, Donutlad, the warrior!!!

the north spawn ive noticed is the most finicky from my experience it tends to deviate the most in comparison to the others

[I got you fam.](https://imgur.com/a/nCryrfJ)
---
Yes, I think having anti-social dickheads on my server makes it a more interesting place, that is exactly what I'm saying. I enjoy the opportunity to exist in a space where I have to deal with the possibility of other players being hostile.
---
First wave was roughly two weeks ago with people who started a sub for Character Creation / Name Reservation.
---
Being a mage myself I approve of this tactic
---
I just realized that Stonetalon Mountains zone looks like...a talon made of mountains!
---
The humans looked great, what are you talking about? Costume design was on point, and all main actors were good.
---
Brings back memories of high school.
---
Go 5/5 wand mastery, then shadow till around 35. After 35 you can spam dungeons grinds for levels and then it will be ok to go holy. Leveling as holy early game is Aids - Source: Leveled a Vanilla Priest as Holy.
---
He‚Äôs 34 and can‚Äôt do level 40-50 dungeons or even survive those zones to be helpful in summoning/get the flight paths that would make him useful.
---
you try AoE with 3 locks and then with 3 mages. the difference is night and day. spell cleave in classic means mages. it's not only about AoE, it's also about 100% control of the pull. Locks can't do that. Nobody but mages can. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So when people look for a spell cleave group, it's 3+ mages (depends). It doesn't mean anyone who can AoE. It's specifically mages.
---
Me and a mage were about to do the captains chest quest in STV where you kill the elite giant. Undead warrior started killing crabs nearby and I wanted to hold off pulling till he left. He was taking his sweet time so I just pulled anyway and in comes the warrior charging right at us. 
---
I freaked for a second until I realized he charged the giant and was helping us kill him. That giant almost killed all three of us and if it wasn‚Äôt for our undead bro helping we would not have survived. Hats off to you my man, whoever you are.
---
If you just want to support your mage I would take skinning and either herbalist or mining.  The problem with non harvesting professions is they tend to be a gold/time sink to level.  So if the mage is your main and this is the alt then just grab everything you can and sell it so that those profits can go towards your main.  Eventually at 60 you can probably drop skinning and pick up another profession that will be way quicker to level at max.
---
The dps is merely average. The damage range is poor, and the proc is useless for PVE outside of the additional damage. It's outshone by blues in BRD.
---
Ditch WINE and install Lutris. Check out Lutris.org and read the directions (it has dependencies like gnu-wine or something).
---
There's also a defense Blizz set up for the DDoS attacks that killed Linux boxes from accessing servers, so you have to change your TTL on packets to 80. If you get to the Realm select screen and keep DCing I'll find that post for you
---
because his doesn't make sense. If you're killed you have to run to your body which takes multiple minutes, and you res at half health and mana and have to eat and drink. If he kills your pet all you do is res it and feed it then drink. Literally takes 30 seconds so I can't even fathom how it annoys someone more to waste 30 seconds of time compared to multiple minutes.
---
Yes. As a rogue, I feel I should say sorry for all the times I have sapped a hunter, and then killed his pet. Then waited for him to revive and repeat it. 
---
Only twice tho, I don‚Äôt camp people. Unless they attack first.
---
Gatorbite axe is a level 48 3.2 AS weapon with 13 higher top end. The Chief's Enforcer from the same dungeon as Sul'Thraze is a 3.4 AS level 45 staff with 15 higher top end. Sul'Thraze is still better than either of those two because the DPS is just that much higher, but it has worse AoE damage and its mortal strikes hit for far less.
---
ST is a sick weapon, it's just not that good...
---
Am i missing the joke or smt?
---
Sorry dude! Unfortunately this was all the information I had and I wanted to share it because everyone guards like crazy!! Like most I didn't play private servers and a video like this would have helped me a TONNE! But as others have above sharing the knowledge appose to just bringing nothing to the table I'm sure would be GREATLY appreciated by so many people! :)
---
Are you for fucking real, its literally all I've seen since launch
---
I don't really have a guide to recommend, I've just been playing one since vanilla.
---
Best advice I can give you is:
---
1. Learn all your abilities and what they do.
---
2. Learn *other* classes abilities.. primarily the ones they use against you. That way you won't try killing a warrior with retaliation up or CCing a big red hunters pet.
---
3. When you lose, pay attention. *What* killed you? You get nothing from saying "oh that was bullshit" and moving on. What did they do that stopped you from killing them? For example most classes priority will always be to put a bleed or a DoT on us.. something to prevent stealth. This is why many rogues opt for stunlock instead of outright damage... it takes a bit longer but you can disengage any time you like.
---
4. Learn common tactics. For example a mage will almost always blink immediately upon being attacked.. right out of your cheap shot, wasting it. And if you give them a chance to polymorph you, you're probably dead. So instead, open with an Ambush and then immediately sprint (especially if they freeze you to the ground) and rush them. Gouge whatever spell they're casting and then go to town. Or for next level fun wait for them to be facing a wall instead and watch them blink right in to it!
---
5. Don't neglect blind. Blind gives you enough time to bandage up *and* reenter stealth. It's extremely valuable and nowhere near enough rogues use it properly.
---
As for going up against groups, basically look for a weak link. If their healer sits down to drink, delete them. Ambush/BS/evis and they're probably dead. Vanish **immediately** or you will die as everyone else runs over... give them a few seconds to break apart then pick the next most weakest person. Maybe sap someone then sprint off to attack someone else. Stealth is your weapon, if you are caught in the open you are going to die.
---
Rogues are tons of fun, just keep playing and keep stabbing and you'll have a great time!
---
good luck lol
---
Do more JT movies work **for** or **against** you?
---
[removed]
---
when you can get double or more xp/hour... why are you surprised?
---
I thought I was the only one. I get to the point where I‚Äôve put in a few hours and I‚Äôm like hmmmm do I really want to invest more time with this guy?
---
Re-roll.
---
After 5 characters I‚Äôve put my foot down and I‚Äôm playing the character I didn‚Äôt want to play initially because it‚Äôs who I was 10+ years ago.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôm just a Human Paladin kind of guy. I love running around helping people. Reviving them. Throwing them heals. Always offering to be someone‚Äôs pocket healer on a quest etc.
---
It‚Äôs not the most interesting class to me but it‚Äôs the most enjoyable.
---
Until you realize its from an npc and no one loves you haha - jp, it was funny I got one too
---
One of those things is not like the other, but if you enjoy both more power to you. Fill yer boots.
---
The WC bow is better sadly
---
All my friends already stopped playing because they'd rather spend their time on other games instead, I don't blame them, WoW is a big time commitment. Our guild also died and its kind of a big bummer. Really killed my motivation to play.
---
But is he Horde now? üòÑ
---
It's just a stupid [meme](https://pics.me.me/ipod-ipad-paid-peed-and-farded-and-hidcec-anid-came-34072610.png).
---
this happened to me in STV as well.
---
I actually had a few people whisper me once after I killed some horde a few times. It was actually fucking hilarious and brought back something I didn't know I missed
---
yeah but they share the same CD and you have to be in the correct stance to use one. Retaliation is Battle stance example.
---
Oh I see. Yeah you're right. I've been reading that wrong this whole time lol.
---
Yes. Later is fine too cause wand but after 38 levels you probably want a change.
---
Hunters are indeed great to solo. They are great at endgame PvP too (assuming Blizz fixes some bugs, which they said they are working on).
---
They are "terrible" at endgame content because they don't scale as well as other DPS classes, but this is mainly a factor in endgame PvE, which you don't seem especially interested in. A well played Hunter can destroy Battlegrounds.
---
Rogue is obviously a great PvP class. Not bad at solo leveling, either. Not going to be able to solo Elite quests like a Hunter can, though.
---
Shamans are great, but are typically seen as healers for end game content. Both Enhancement and Elemental can be beastly PvP specs, but both need decent gear to be effective, which you will likely have to obtain by healing in raids.
---
I would suggest looking into Warlock. They have a lot of the same pros as Hunter because they are a pet class with great leveling efficiency, and they scale a lot better in future content.
---
not really, the stakes are high and it's unrealistic to expect kindness when that kind of amount is in play. And honestly it's understandable.
---
It‚Äôs Nipple, not Circle.
---
Haven't checked my account today but I'm hoping I haven't used my VPN while otherwise RIP for me too
---
I got them but nobody buys them on the server I  on
---
I hate the fact no one seems to want to wait for threat to be built in this game now.  Makes tanking more stressful than it needs to be.
---
that one interaction has caused you to come to the conclusion that spellcleave is making people too dumb to dungeon with. what a retarded conclusion lol.
---
I‚Äôve always been a feral Druid, I started in wrath so I never got to play classic, but it feels unmotivating when everyone is already at end game yaknow aha
---
Not their work, just their character. They did link to the artist.
---
I'm not saying you made all this up, but that dialogue sounds exactly like someone making up a conversation.
---
So the hunter would have to Rez the pet. Then not feed it. So he deserves to lose the pet.
---
Already have some quality meta memes coming out of here.
---
Nice.
---
You can either wait and keep your wand talent or just spec back to it by 45. 
---
I decided to just go for shadow form and put points back into wand as I level. 
---
At level 43, I would say I am doing far more damage with shadow form then if I kept wand spec
---
Warridiots*
---
Yes, 100%.
---
I'll check that out, I have to run a dual boot regardless so I'm content to have WoW on my windows drive for now.
---
We don‚Äôt pick mage because we want a complicated rotation.
---
We do it because we can hot key all the buttons we need to a mouse and can put a book on our stomach as a trackpad while laying on the couch, watching tv.
---
Right, everyone?...............
---
So far all of my adventures have been on my wee little lvl 20 warrior.  Even though I was hesitant I swam up the Durotar coastline, and as soon as I saw the ?? murlocs I had to bail. This is an adventure for a later time lol.
---
Ok.
---
Thats beyond low
---
Regret rollin on a RPPvP realm. Today I spent 4 hours looking for a dungeon. LBRS or Strat Live. Found 2 runs to Strat Live in the evening. Of course the neck I need did not drop. During the night there's no one at all.
---
And people didn't even start leaving because they're bored with the game. Idk how deserted it's going to be in later phases.
---
I don't have Auctioneer atm, but I know it used to offer a "quick scan" feature that took like 60 seconds.
---
Yeah I leveled some in Arathi today and on **three** occasions a level 60 Alliance rolled into Hammerfall and started wantonly murdering everything.
---
It was never the same person.
---
And this is on Skeram, which is apparently like 70/30 Horde-Ally. The Alliance there are bloodthirsty.
---
I think their point is if your pet gets killed twice in a row it's likely to keep happening, so may as well stop it happening.
---
If you use a built in emote, they will see it. If you use a custom emote, it will say "begins to make strange gestures."
---
No one interrupts anything in my experience. I've enabled party announcements on my interrupts just to remind people that they exist.
---
I'm secretly hoping they don't dip too much, but got a tight knit guild so will have some guys to rock with.
---
How did you set your faction and class like that?
---
actually read this one mid BFD, the regrowth and rejuv worked nicely, will needa pick up the resto talent later when i level more
---
WTF is wrong with Blanchy?
---
Dude what are you talking about? FD doesn't reset aggro, tank doesn't need yo regenerate threat.
---
There's a traitor amongst us!... and he touched my ass...
---
Who said I rushed? I didn't AoE level. I played the game the way it was intended to be played and now I'm level 60. It isn't my fault there's not shit to do besides MC/Ony in phase 1. It's like this subreddit can't handle the fact that people don't think the end-game is fun in phase 1. Sorry if that hurts peoples feelings but my original post was me stating that I'm burnt out and the phase 1 content doesn't interest me. Don't know why I'm getting downvoted like I personally attacked the game or the devs. lol its fuckin weird.
---
Omg awesome jobs on these rogue that try you first lol. I hope to get that good with my rogue
---
WaR was great on so many levels, just endgame was  really bad, servers couldn't handle  it at all
---
some people aren't poor and can do shit for giggles.
---
I'm actually kind of surprised. ESO is like the polar opposite of Classic Wow.
---
Then again, I like ESO, but Classic Wow is what I have been always searching for in an MMO, even though I did not play it back in the day. It seems like it is what an MMO is actually supposed to be like. I like that classes are super specialized instead of 'everyone is dps but some can tank a little more and some can provide a little buffs/healing but everyone has buffs and some sort of self heal'. I like lack of fast travel because it makes traveling more intentional and adventuresome. I like that factions have actual rivalry and actually fight over things in the actual world instead of pvp being restricted to a specific area or mode.
---
Only thing is, if my friend is a different level than me, we can't both play together and gain something valuable for our characters, unlike ESO. I don't really get why Wow's level scaling makes people feel more powerful than ESO's level scaling. I don't normally go to lower level zones and dunk on noob mobs, and I don't go to higher level zones to be slaughtered by those mobs. I play at same level and the only things that change are the level numbers go higher which doesn't do a thing for me. But what does make me feel powerful is fleshing out my build so that I get more skills and those skills interact and build off of each other, which happens in both Wow and ESO.
---
This exact same thing happened to me..hahahaha. 2 people standing around, everything around them dead. 
---
I ran up, grouped, blew horn, we killed. That‚Äôs when they said I was good luck because they had been waiting 45 minutes..lmao.
---
Of course I explained to them they needed to blow the horn. We all had a good laugh.
---
Who gives a fuck? Its the same damn end result.. whether you all need or all fucking greed, 1 random person will win.
---
Needing just prevents ninjas. Use your damn brain
---
i got 12 tokens
---
Yeah, I'm level 55 and I've been playing an average of ~7 hours a day since Classic launched. I'm basically spending my entire evenings playing and all day on weekends. Even being level 55 when the game has only been out for a little over a month is well ahead of the curve, it's going to take the majority of the playerbase a good while to hit 60.

I ran a dungeon with a warrior tank, restored druid, hunter, shaman, and myself, a rogue. What a nice group if people it was. No wipes, we went a steady pace and everyone got their quests done. I am wary to be in a group with a mage bc honestly I worry it would ruin that experience for me.
---
Coming from working in Customer Service for several years, you definitely made the right move by posting about it. 
---
At least where I worked, social media exposure of an issue sets off all kinds of alarm bells and escalates the ticket's priority. Fairly common to throw in some service credit for this kind of escalation as well.
---
Same goes for most other businesses. It sucks, but social media clout will get their attention.
---
Why?
---
What is the chunk of meat at the bottom? Is that supposed to represent a poor human pally trying to level in stranglethorn vale, because that looks accurate as hell
---
Truefaith is bis until 3pc T2 which is going to be ages for most people.
---
Wait you‚Äôre telling me you can use The Who tab and not just see a random assortment of people from all over the map?
---
Ferals actually do outclass Warriors in mitigation when crushing blows aren't on the table. Many adds on boss fights are level 62 or lower, which means no crushing blows, which means more mitigation from a Druid than Warr.
---
It's besides the point though. Extra threat is very rarely needed. Examples would be Vael, which is a fight where people can put out much higher than normal levels of DPS.
---
I played it when I went into stv. I rushed to 60 though so it was empty aside from my guildmates and I.
---
Damn dude, im still yet to get even 1 of the weapons, this things awesome for 2h fury.
---
Also Crusader fucking GG mate GG
---
What does red bar mean? I'm in a PvP server
---
I rolled a warrior in vanilla. Ranked every dungeon + was off tank in raids. I never specced into prot until 60. 
---
Shield + 1h, marking targets, using CC, mitigating damage. 
---
There is a reason for fundamentals for tanking because it reduced the god damn risk in having a shit run + downtime. 
---
2hand, charge into mobs, no marks, no cc all increase risk of longer runs, wipes, and and an overall annoying experience...just because some piece of shit kid that watches YouTube all day thinks he‚Äôs ‚Äúmeta‚Äù. ...no he is a dipshit
---
I wont be resubcribing, don't get me wrong im loving it as someone who couldn't get into retail but things are hard atm (irl). I hope my small break wont damage the future of the game.
---
Oh these fucks. The ones I killed loads of to get the moon ones. The ones I now have to go back and kill again for no fucking reason other than I love going back and forth between zones.
---
So its something worth getting, im a priest and would like to raid a lot
---
Wow, someone who thinks out of the box and doesnt jump hate bandwagon. I totally agree, mage not using his wide aoe kit (just cause someone might get offended) is like driving on 2nd gear on the freeway. Ofcourse there are some "omg i frost nova and stand next to mob spamming ae and praying" types of mages, but this is so blown up on this subreddit. Even on small (like 3 mobs) a mage with permafrost, shatter and blizz will not only deal big dmg but provide great cc/slow so other dds can go ham. I mean sure mage can pull a lot of threat, but how does it matter if anyone is barely taking any damage anyway?
---
People really trying to act like Alliance dont gank, huh?
---
There's a difference between doing something solo, mage AoE farming mobs, and someone doing a group activity that most classes in the game aren't welcome to.
---
The two are not comparable. Beyond which, even if they were, dungeon aoe farming groups breaks above and beyond the point of considering it a reasonable class benefit.
---
And for the record, as a shaman I'm one of the classes who benefits from AoE groups.
---
Bombing them can also push them away from your room and spread them through out your house
---
I'm pretty new to the game, my partner introduced it to me a couple of weeks ago after months of trying to get me to play it. My character is a hunter and my first pet ran away because I didn't get it enough food in time. Rookie mistake but I still felt pretty shit about myself. 
---
Then my new pet died and I didn't know I could revive it so I got really sad because I loved the name I picked and had gotten into higher loyalty. I went to get a new one and the game told me I already had a pet. I was so happy when I found out I could revive my pet. 
---
Now I have two high loyalty pets that I'm rotating as we level up. Looking to get a third later when I can afford the extra stable slot.
---
It's just reddit
---
Is there even a forge in darnassus?
---
World first is an outlier. Being able to eliminate the logistical challenges of assembling the group and simply grind away endlessly is a huge advantage not shared by the bulk of the player base.
---
I'm not sure the "Mages have the most level 60s" holds water either. Mages are a popular class and it's awfully hard to get a decent baseline comparison because we have no way of discriminating between "level 30 Druid alt and level 30 Druid I haven't gotten to 60 yet". In any case, I don't see Mages in a statistical different percentage than other classes.
---
Yea...when everyone is really competent and over-leveled for the dungeon I low key just forget to heal the tank sometimes.
---
I don't think I've ever seen that many people in town at once on Ashkandi and we're high pop at peak hours.
---
Perfect

I didnt install Questie so that I could read quest text!

"What are we but slaves to this torment?"

*Bounce bounce bounce*
---
Omg... what about
---
B O O T Y  B A Y
---
Nah, not really any reason to. It's kinda on them to either ranged stick with healer or melee stick with tank. In a raid sometimes I'd mark someone I trust on melee/ranged to tell everyone else to try to stack/stick with them, depending on the fight.
---
This is the way of a good lock. Plus the odd renew/rejuv from me. If I see a lock wanding and drinking I rage. You are not a mage or priest. Play your class properly.
---
No, I‚Äôm a big nerd who plays wow. The original was removed because I didn‚Äôt add flair.
---
From what I can research, I should be fine. But most sites also list a minimum level for each dungeon along with a recommended range.
---
Bruh im the same way, I love the competitiveness and danger of rolling on PvP server, but I have a hard time rationalizing attacking the opposite faction if i just see them leveling, just doesn't feel right,
---
Nice
---
It‚Äôs just a game :) it‚Äôs not the end of the world.
---
Accountability is the key here. There are TONS of people that act like complete assholes in an anonymous space like in video games and don't act like that with real people in front of them, because they know there might be repercussions for it, whereas online the worst possible outcome is minor backlash that you can easily ignore or escape from. That said, an IRL asshole will always be an online asshole too!
---
What are these bugs you mention?
---
Need a feature so you can book raid times like Disneyland rides.
---
let's get this out onto a tray
---
how long is the ban?
---
Can I ask why warlock is good vs. a mage? Started wow a few weeks ago running lock and really don't understand what I should be doing in pvp
---
This oh god this. I rage at locks that don't tap. Slows the whole party down if they go oom and wand. &gt;&lt;
---
I've never been more conflicted.
---
1 month
---
Oh for sure don't spec prot, but 5 points in 2 handed weapon specialization doesn't make your shield stop working.
---
31/5/15 vanilla OT all the way
---
I understand your frustration, but
---
&gt;I understand the want to get to level 60 ASAP but please, let spellcleave die. It's breeding toxicity in the community and ruining people's fun.
---
There are plenty of players out there who play the game well, spellcleave or otherwise, and blaming those who find alternate methods of farming dungeons, when the problem really is people not knowing how to play, seems counterintuitive.
---
Yo, how is everyone hitting 60 so fast? I‚Äôm playing an unhealthy amount and run a lot of dungeons for speed and I‚Äôm only 46. 
---
Are there really that many jobless shots sucking my tax dollars playing at home, or am I missing some super trick?
---
Yeah you're definitely part of the problem.
---
I left a 49 hunter on Stalagg and rerolled on Grobb and don't regret it in the least. Everything about this server is better than Stalagg.

Hi, /u/Unassuming_Moniker

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9spm3/i_thought_id_share_this_animated_ragnaros_live/). 
---
Good use of hunter deadzone
---
I will say tho, at ZF stage I just cant hold threat as an arms warrior one handing.  Spamming sunders I cant even hold single target.  My runs go a lot smoother if I just dps 2 hander.  Usually hold aggro that way.
---
I really want to write an add on that will /w all players a pre determined message if they match certain criteria (ie are they x level, are the in x zone, are they x class)
---
Anyone got got documentation of how to access and manipulate /who data?
---
I'm level 20 and have 3 days /played. Having a great time. All you MAX XP PER HOUR people are doing it wrong.
---
Care to explain?
---
As a heads up, keep an empty stable slot until you hit 60. This is so you can store your favorite pets, then go tame other wild ones to learn abilities to teach your stabled pets. By that I mean taming beasts that know higher rank bite, claw, cower etc. You dont learn top tier abilities until over level 50, and you dont learn some abilities until after 30 (cats don't learn prowl until about level 32, I think, could be wrong there)
---
People that doesn't have 90g at 40 is the people who are buying every single spell they can from their trainers and/or buy too much gear of the AH. If you only train what you need and dont buy stuff on the AH you'll EASILY have 90g by 40.
---
"You think you d.."
---
Or just spec permafrost so melee mobs barely move, its rather simple for tank to reagro 30%ms mobs with tiny blizzard damage.
---
What about butt karma?
---
making drink costs mana. what I've seen over and over is people ask for water in dungeons. I always carry 100+ water when entering dungeons. I'll ask people who are on the way to dungeons if they need water because I have time to make more. Nobody says a word. Then they finally make it inside and ask for water. I trade out all my water and more people ask for it. So I say "making water"... I waste all my mana making more and the group pulls. At times like these, I wish I charged 1g per stack.
---
Was this one of the items that has been layer-farmed before blizzard put out that announcement? What‚Äôs the droprate for such a pattern and who drops it? ( someone in stratholme, right)
---
Unholy forsaken scum, have the decency to stay dead.

#TaurensNotTotems

I was able to find enough SM parties last night quick enough to hit the 5 instance per hour lockout on Grobb as alliance. Server is busy.
---
Just an FYI, since comprehension doesn't seem to be a strong suit of redditors, I never said that everyone is buying gold. No reason to get all defensive here. I fully understand that many get it through conventional means. I merely stated that gold buying explained how so many were picking up their mounts at 40. I saw a guy complaining in chat that he had no gold at level 24. 5 days later the same dude was running around on his mount.  If you got your gold through conventional means, great! You and I know that most people do not have the dedication that it takes to achieve that amount of gold by 40. It's not that people have mounts at 40, it's the amount of people that do that puzzled me.
---
Idk what lvl10 will get you, but lvl35 for 300.
---
Make your own group and invite everyone?
---
Why would you even want to join an exp run where not having the right setup would net you less exp/hour than just questing
---
Something something screen shot
---
Eastern Plaguelands are called that because they‚Äôre east of the Western Plaguelands
---
That's a big one
---
Damn right. If tank wants to go room by room without waiting on the casters, then tank is gonna have a bad time. Learn your place tanks.
---
Facts! 
---
I've saved multiple wipes simply by functioning as a back up tank, it takes 2 bag slots and realistically 1 or 2 oh shit macros.
---
That‚Äôs pretty funny that you think only alliance do that trash. I play both sides and believe me it‚Äôs way more common to have that shit happen from a horde. Seems like alliance have better shit to do than hang around dungeon entrances and be lame.
---
I never understood why people pussy out when raid leads say to go in. Are you scared to die in the video game? Why do people stop in their tracks and need to be reminded to keep pushing. Even a guild like APES seems to do it.
---
What‚Äôs rooftop camping?
---
500? Amatures! 
---
*cries in whitemaine*
---
Ouh ouh ouh ??!
---
I think that‚Äôs the issue. They weren‚Äôt advertising that they were reserved so they were wasting people‚Äôs time by not letting them know beforehand.
---
Neither of this is proof of bans for buying gold (not that I don't believe you).
---
Hate to tell you this, but you obey that CC chart and you'll be blacklisted as a raid leader. It's already the case on Faerlina. It's a meme across the competitive WoW community.
---
Excuse me, I volunteer for Blizzard. Reported
---
you will need to keep your pet well fed so yes you will have to buy food often
---
To get to 60 in under a month you either need to exploit unintended mechanics, which a bunch of people did, or just play 16 hours a day, which a lot of people did.
---
Oh damn, thats rough. I think blizzard just did a ban wave since I got banned for 7 days and theres a lot of people talking about bans too.
---
The boss is like an extra 30 seconds for a massive upgrade, so yeah.
---
#PeopleNotVendingMachines is the Mage equivalent. 
---
How fucking dare you asking for extra drinks when I‚Äôm level 10/20/30/40/50.
---
They really aren't bad at all. I have yet to be forced into a cleave group. It's kinda like D.A.R.E where you hear that drug dealers are handing out crack to 12 year olds for free but in reality no one forces drugs down your throat. Likewise no one is making you to do cleave groups. I'm on Herod where it's all the rage and if I don't read /LookingForGroup you wouldn't even know it was a thing. Everyone just likes to bitch about stuff they're not into.
---
A level 5 alt with enchanting can disenchant any item so it's worth it. The mats you get from disenchanting the greens from 20-30ish and up can be worth more on the AH than vendoring the item iteself. So it's worth it. A lot of white items are worth mailing to your alt and selling on the AH too.
---
I already see population dropping on Several sever. Skeram and Fairbank for example.
---
But player base  is still big enough for me to enjoy thegame
---
I really thought I'd regret rolling a Rogue over a Mage, because I always do, every time I return to WoW.
---
Not this time, after the bad rap their getting due to spellcleave meta lol.
---
My only regret is not rolling an orc. They're too bulky to be a rogue, that's my beef with them, but God if their passives aren't OP.
---
Mostly related to the skill ‚ÄúFeign Death.‚Äù
---
You get it at level 30 iirc. 
---
The skill is supposed to remove you from Combat, which allows you to place traps during a fight. 
---
Very useful for PvP because you can Feign Death and then drop say a Freezing Trap to freeze a Rogue or Warrior that‚Äôs in your face, allowing you to get a range advantage on them. Pretty much an essential tactic for Hunters in endgame PvP. 
---
Currently, the skill does not drop combat when it should. (at least for some people)
---
Blizz has acknowledged the bugs and said they are working on a solution. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it as it would most likely be fixed by the time Battlegrounds make it into the game, but it is something to consider.
---
Sounds like you just suck, dude. Dungeons are bad for xp unless you have a dedicated group that knows how to clear them quickly.
---
What is the process for getting addons for wow classic? Bartender, bagnon, etc - are these wow mods cross compatible, or do authors / other programmers modify code to work? What are the safe / reputable websites for downloading these addons for classic
---
Thanks for the perspective. I‚Äôll try to learn from it.
---
/r/classicwow/comments/d9897u/im_prepared_to_accept_layering_but_dont_take_away/
---
1. My comment wasn't about marking targets but rather informing your group where you plan to fight. Sometimes you need to body pull, sometimes ranged pull, sometimes charge the spawn. In each case, you want your group set up where the battle will be - not guessing what you're doing.  
---
2. Pulling *around* a corner is one thing. Pulling *into* a corner is generally a bad idea because it forces all your ranged in melee.  
---
4. Actually, much of the time you should be letting your healer take those huge hits. Remember, all those defensive abilities tanks receive are against *physical* damage. Against magical damage, you're no better than the rest of the group - and often worse (healing specs generally have magical damage reduction talents). Moreover, for all healers except Paladins, it's easier/more efficient to heal light damage on multiple targets than heavy damage on one. Since nukes don't delay/interrupt spellcasting much, having a Priest soak down a few shadowbolts works just fine.
---
And use abilities in certain orders for sweet sweet combo fields

In classic BGs, the regeneration powerup gives pet happiness as well as health.

Lol good catch

Not dead. Transfer while you still can.
---
Very nice. I got jang in my first 5 runs. Now hoping there's a bit of rng left for the over half.
---
As a group of rouge's., me an my buddies sap the hunter, kill the pet. Then fade away to repeat the process. When hunter finaly run, the 1 rouge that was doin the sap an killing waves good by. Only for the other rouge to tail him an wait for him to summon his pet. We do thins until we get bored, find a new target, or he logs.
---
lol this happens every time i tank rip
---
they might be getting rid of the factions, hard to tell. there was a big cinematic where saurfang and anduin talked about "breaking the cycle" that heavily implied no more factions, however this is blizzard we are talking about so take everything with a fucking TON of salt. i will believe it when I see it especially since they still charge $30 for faction trasnfer so they have a financial incentive (only thing they care about) to keep it in
---
I hope so
---
Oh cool. Still great nonetheless
---
avoid all roofs until further notice
---
There were several other Horde in the cave, I thought that was implied by the rest of the context. Such as my saying "we had to kill all the Horde in the cave."
---
He attacked when he thought he had the numbers. As he was standing near a Warrior that my friend and I chose not to attack a few minutes prior.
---
What impressed me most was, despite the fact I thought I posted the ticket in the wrong spot and deleted it, they still found the tickets apparently. Even more, just based on the convo, they found my account and emailed me without any back and forth. That kind of thoroughness can only come from them having a pretty sophisticated CS service. 
---
That's all to say, I think regardless if I posted it would have been resolved. They impressed me here.
---
Rose tinted nostalgia....
---
Everyone thinks it was streamers doing it for *speed* and not doing it because they're on PVP servers with giant beacons lit over their heads saying 'GANK ME HERE!'
---
They all hid in instances to just flat-out avoid people.
---
It's just reasonable really. BoPs, greens and shitty blue items aren't equivalent to BoE epics that can fetch between 150-300gp on the ah.
---
Where in this post were they mad???
---
I haven't touched tinder or bumble since August 26th.

yep you have to close and re-open

this is peak reddit right here

Farmed dinos at PvE server at very early morning making 130g/h
---
False. **Speed runners** took 4 days 20 hours in vanilla (No layers) to 60. Don't make the guy feel like an idiot when he's more correct than you are.
---
I have the cheap parrot and Siamese cat but I already have too much bag space dedicated and I don't feel those live up to the bar set by the other pets. Farmed the crimson whelp, emerald whelp and ooze myself while leveling off the mobs (emerald too 18 hour and 6 levels rip). The chicken was a gift from my friend, the dark whelp I got for 30g a while ago and the hyacanth macaw... Let me tell you about this one. I come from FFXI where I once spent 2 weeks camping a mob every day to get a random back piece that did almost nothing, but it was rare and the only item in the slot that had any effect on the class I was playing. The point is, I know how to grind, I was born in the grind. In retail, I ground all of these pets, except the macaw. I sat in stv (this was after it was made a zone drop) and killed... for a month. 30k mobs easily. It was the last thing I ever tried to do on retail, the grind beat me. So this time, just like all the other pet's I leveled up on the bloodsail pirates for about two levels and it was terrible. Way too many people, so I decided to just skip it and hope. The other day, after checking the ah multiple times a day, I saw the first hyacanth macaw pop up, 800g, reasonable but way out of my range. A couple of days later, I saw one at bid 100g, and I ran back to orgimar only to make it too late, it had less than 30 minutes when I saw it with my alt and I was too late, crushed. 100g was as low as I could ever hope to find a macaw. Then this morning, I logged on purely to check for a macaw and I saw one... listed at 18g... and here was are. Sorry the length.  
---
tl:dr: farmed crimson, emerald, and ooze. chicken was a gift, dark whelp bought for 30g and snagged hyacanth macaw off the ah for 18g. broken tooth I got lucky and only took a couple of tries logging off there.
---
There‚Äôs no clear way to just jump right up there and targeting the player from the ground aggros the guards as normal. This is why it‚Äôs an exploit. 
---
Also vanilla didn‚Äôt have walls, so yeah.
---
Blizzard trailers are always dope
---
Maybe it's your layer? I'm on Kirtonos and I usually see plenty of people around. Have you tried typing /who in chat?
---
Just make our spines read-only /s
---
still better than male night elf lol
---
That would be an incredibly interesting add on
---
So... are you saying you can hold aggro against a mage? even if they give you time to build up threat?
---
Weird because I recognise your name AFTER seeing you in wow!! Yojambros for eva
---
So Higher range &gt; DPS then. Also why is slower attacking better? Just curious
---
While I can't imagine Blizzard doing this because their programmers are complete garbage and I doubt they have the capacity to write it, it's possible if you have been in a small area for an hour and haven't interacted with npcs and only did WASD or space, that it marks you as "potentially afk" on big servers. Maybe when needed they do a rolling kick of these marked players every hour, hoping to let people in queue in faster since most of the kicked people probably won't log back in within the grace period.
---
If you hit the mob and do 1 or more damage (tagging) outside of a party and your friend kills it, you get the full xp. In party you will get much less xp if you are for example lvl 25 and your friend 60. XP is 50:50 if you are same level. But Iam not sure if he can transfer back to his old server.
---
A lot of people exploited layering and/ or AoE farming dungeons when the game first launched. It will get you to 60 faster, but it's a hollow experience and leaves you behind on things like Faction Reputation and Professions. A lot of Mages, Priests, Warriors and Warlocks got to 60 for this reason.
---
People who have leveled several characters in the past know the optimal zone/ quest routes to take (or they just use an Addon like Azeroth AutoPilot)
---
And some people just play 12 hours a day.
---
Level 46 is probably still on the higher end of the bell curve right now, though. I'd say you're doing fine compared to most "normal" players.
---
Logged off there, the hyacanth macaw and ooze are the real rare items there.
---
Hits close to home
---
Yeaaaaah thats a common way to deal with boe epics on EU servers as well.
---
lol read again
---
Good reply thank you.
---
The further something is from your level, the greater % of reduced CP you get from that mob. I believe it works both directions. And when something is high enough above you, you cant even get a hit.
---
I‚Äôll keep you in mind! Kromcrush warlock here!
---
&gt; but then you have to ask why people who don't like PvP are playing on a PvP server in the first place.
---
You could also read his comment in the first place to find out why.
---
If nicking stuff other people could actually use, and are signing a green light to use them, then you are literally saying that being a ninja is reasonable
---
I befriended a warrior that said he was either going until he got it or hit 52... he was 52 and still in there, i don't think  he ever got it.
---
I had a fury war in SM the other night that would literally attack whatever mob I wasnt directly handling.
---
Skull over head and everything, he'd just slap the shit out of the mob next to it. Every pull. My co-op healer was like 'fuck it, let him tank one, we're fine right now.'
---
were you the guy who was mass flagged by asmon
---
"Happy Tank Noises*
---
So they let a bug exploit exist for too long... but also, they shouldn't fix the bug exploit.
---
I mean, avoiding dungeons entirely is always an option. Mages are good enough solo to not need to rip your hair out acquiescing to the spellcleave dungeon "meta."
---
Not super easy to spam from what I've seen.  Of course I'm not in a huge guild either so idk lol
---
Never seen that happen. People greed on greeds and need on needs. Why people have to make it more complicated than it is is something I wont understand. Just be a reasonable person
---
See that's a reasonable time to be frustrated with people asking. It's annoying when we're all grouped up outside the dungeon breifing and I can't get any water
---
Illusory rod just dropped, me and my priest friend needed, so did a feral Druid. I won, and it‚Äôs a great feeling!
---
I think the bigger test is the sub reset after that. A lot of people are still not even halfway to 60 so they‚Äôre willing to keep going, but another 30 days will be when the majority drop
---
You clearly have never jail breaked
---
I play on Incendius and outside of STV, I got ganked 10-15 or so times on the way to 60. Which is to say not very much. Faction population is pretty balanced. STV was unplayable solo; that just makes you group up and end up often engaging in medium scale pvp (5v5ish) which is a great time. 
---
I think your problem is not so much that you're on a pvp server, but on a streamer server.
---
I don't know how it's petty to want to have a fair game
---
Succ is not 25% of your damage later on. I was following a guide but switched to imp because of the damage and smaller mana pool. I dont know if you are already 60, if you are not then you will see what i say at some point. You can however stick to succ, i just prefered to have a manaslave with endless mana.
---
You want to play on a server named after a starving old horse to sick to pull a wagon?
---
But then i loose my /yell HAIL SHEEP macro
---
Nobody is commenting on the people who are already level 60 telling them to "enjoy life"... They've probably played 6+ hours a day since release
---
Shamans are a support class. They make everyone else better. Melee dps want shamans for Strength of Earth and Windfury totems. Tanks want Stoneskin and Grace of Air totem. Hunters want Grace of Air and Mana Spring totem. Casters want Mana Spring totem.
---
Smart play with specific comps and it'll still be fine.
---
Spellcleave meta is also 'what the fuck is CC'-meta
---
AoE farming is for try hards. I know, i did a bunch of it for fast exp. 
---
Reserve has always existed in the game. It sucks, but there are groups that dont reserve gear. I personally have never reserved an item because i dont feel its right. 
---
Getting kicked from /world tells me that someone had admin rights for the channel and just didnt like the guy in your group. Wait an hour and /join world. 
---
Do not worry so much about not knowing MC. Personally i would just say that once you get invited whisper the raid leader and ask him to give a break down on the fights. MC is actually mind numbingly easy, just has a few things that are required. Example is mages decursing instead of DPS'ing on some fights. 
---
TL/DR - enjoy the game. Dont worry about anyone else. Unless you ninja - or purposely wipe the raid over and over, you wont get blacklisted.
---
Tricked again!
---
Yeah but you would quest amd grind in the lvl youre at while the higher lvl just finiahes off everything that you've hit first
---
nope, not if they intend to let the players keep their advatage
---
Not talking about PVEers
---
I maintank healed ragnaros as prot spec. It shouldn't matter just have some heal gear
---
I hear you on gnomes bro.
---
I saw a gnome warrior at under 10% health and 2 mobs on him recently.  I did the right thing and Mind Blasted him the last 10% to save the repair üëç.
---
It's called Spy.
---
So attack power isn't a stat?
---
Says huntard, criticises people for saying retard...
---
????
---
Not talking about leveling.
---
&gt;you must not have played WoW much after Vanilla or something lol...
---
quit sortof mid bc. so yeah.
---
&gt; Still pretty anecdotal
---
Indeed it is. Never claimed otherwise.
---
&gt; hope you find more enjoyable experiences in the future
---
Thanks. The guild-run dungeons I mentioned are working out for me.
---
This is exactly my experience.  They treat you like you're a robot, not a person.
---
Let me guess... holy paladin
---
meh, i rolled druid.  lol
---
It's very possible it's more server related. A server like faerlina/herod is probably rife with the pseudo "meta" whereas another server like atiesh might have barely any of it. Hard to say since it's almost all anecdotal.
---
Pretty much every warrior ability scales off weapon damage, so your abilities are all going to hit quite a bit harder. Faster weapons cause more frequent auto attacks but you lose the damage on your insta my abilities.
---
85k at 59 is still fine. Less than 3 hours for 59 to 60 is good.
---
Hmm, ClassicCodex has an ingame window with the database of all items where you can search for any item and link it:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex
---
But, my argument is that I can use it as well, to sell to buy myself a BoE epic (such as wardens staff) that is useful to me. IMO, just because you *can* use it, doesn't entitle you to it when its a BoE worth considerable gold. Everyone should need it and carry on.
---
Also, if you run into a druid or a paladin out in the world, strike up a conversation about 'If I'm a rogue in a dungeon with a bear tank/pally tank, what should I do differently'.
---
Almost all ferals and paladins will tank 5 mans some of the time, or they will heal 5 mans some of the time, and either one is good for you.
---
Again, the aim is friends list, so when they need another one for UBRS/LBRS/whatever, they go 'I know a not-fuckwit rogue. Lets see if he's on'.
---
how is hunter difficult to solo??
---
As long as it's a fair coin, one flip has nothing to do with any previous flips...
---
Just do brd still if u get get into a lbrs
---
\&gt;A 44 warrior "arms tank". When two of us mentioned him having no shield, he responded with "I've seen streamers tank with no shield". Fine, whatever.
---
You can easily 2H arms tank the entire leveling content up to early BRD. Maybe even more but that's what I've been able to do, both spellcleave and regular runs.
---
Depended on the competition. With little to no competition I would rotate between 3 spawns getting somewhere between 13-18 kills an hour.  At higher population times I would rotate two and get 8-12 an hour. If it was packed, i played my alt
---
Detection radius is one click shy of max zoom, if you're using the plus/minus buttons on the minimap.
---
I had a guildmate gimme some to test something and yep, on teh gag AH sold for 5x what they did in org
---
Looks about right.
---
Or warlock dots on everything.
---
I saw one person using that and they had it set so that if they saw an Alliance it would tell LocalDefence the co-ordinates.     
---
     
---
Barrens was very unhappy about it.
---
Certain classes can abuse roofs to evade guards and still shoot at/kill other players with no repercussions. Normally this is why guards exist to prevent just mass camping in cities such as Gadgetzan, but if you're on a roof the guards can't reach you, as such is seen as an exploit and reportable.
---
So, you can go on a roof and camp on it all you want, but if you engage in pvp doing so you risk getting reported.
---
FFS the amount mages that blizzard 2 mobs is INSANE.
---
Sounds like you burned yourself out mate.
---
I'm in Strath right now with 2  lvl 58 paladins. Go do your Ony attunment chain at least.
---
Just unsubbed myself.  Really felt like spellcleave turned the classic dungeon experience into a meme.
---
Shamans are hybrids, so they are kind of a "jack of all trades," with more of a Healing skew than say a Druid.
---
They are extremely useful and sought after in Raids due to their utility. Windfury Totem alone can dramatically increase Raid dps. Tremor Totem makes several encounters easier.
---
They are the only class available to Horde besides Priest that can reliably Resurrect.
---
They are the best AoE healers in Vanilla due to Chain Heal, which makes them great Raid healers.
---
So yeah, they definitely have a specific role and are in demand for healing in Raids. Their other specs (Enhancement and Elemental) can be ridiculous in PvP when geared properly.
---
All the information is out there now. It wasn't in 2004.
---
man, I always carry lots. but sometimes I have to make more and as I'm making it, the group pulls. brainless morons.
---
I just hit friendly with Argent Dawn and bought a stack of their biscuits which are far superior than my mage crafted lvl 45 waters. I‚Äôm very excited to get full mana off of one sitting for once.
---
Shit went from 50/50 to what feels like 90/10 in favor of Ally. Theres MAYBE like 20-30 people in Org between the Bank/AH/FP. At this rate, I will most likely reroll on a different server.
---
What‚Äôs the mobs name ?
---
This is how you get on my KoS list, when you go out of the way to CC a Hunter and kill their pet.  
---
That's also not how pets work. You've have to somehow make the hunter ress their pet, then kill it again and repeat this process countless times before it runs away. All you're doing is being a jackass and wasting a few silver or less for the hunter.
---
Are you using an action bar replacement add-on by chance? I haven't used the Mind Control cap in ages but my recollection is a pet bar pops up, similar to what warlocks and hunters get.
---
what lol? if you're still not 60 and aoe grinding dungeons im sure you just dont have a lot of time to play but want to use your time efficiently in game. So you should aoe grind if you're still not 60
---
Hi, /u/Completejerry

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9t08f/everyone_wanna_tank/). 
---
I used to be this way, but it kinda bothered me being so flippant about my PvP. It didn't seem right from an immersion perspective. So I crafted a Code of Honor for myself, and I'm now working to build a guild around that.
---
arms tank is fine. with a 1h and a shield..
---
Dynamic respawns have always been in the game. There was an interview with an ex wow dev that confirmed it.
---
Also you can see it in action especially in caves if there are two parties in there
---
Love it!
---
Yeah who woulda thought someone "twinking out" while leveling would do more dmg compared to someone rocking leveling gear, especially a hunter where they naturally have great dps at the leveling stage due to how they scale.
---
Then calling out low dps in sm, some 30 ish level dungeons like it actually matters. I'm sure it gets "lots of reactions". Not sure why you would want to stir the pot in a pug over dps just to put the group in a bad mood and have a toxic run. I hear calling people scrubs is a sure way to get invited back.
---
Were all super impressed with those massive 1100 aim shots tho.
---
They call them the blasted lands. I'm not sure why.
---
Because a *whoooooole* lot of people 'wanting Vanilla' just wanted to do the raids at-level to see them and/or grind pvp honor to say they got [rank].
---
It's why any streamer not in raid will have a few thousand views, but as soon as they step into MC they rocket up to a few tens-of-thousands.
---
Meaningless... or l33t h4x.
---
He also has a huge level advantage on them.
---
What Lutris means is you can have a 16 gb USB stick with permanence that can play WoW on any computer that you can turn off and back on
---
So basically your gold is better than someones gear. So basically youre a ninja. Because you need on stuff other peoples gear, to get gold. Thus making you a ninja. I mean whats so hard to grasp on this very simple idea? Just say youre a ninja and be done with it, I dont care, but coming up with those excuses is just tiring
---
Where be the layering, did they change it?
---
1 pts is ng is a wasted point imo. I put one pt during leveling but was always useless as when I needed it it didn't t proc soon enough
---
Derp, you guys are right. From what I‚Äôve read the only affect is to crit% because defense still works in pvp. Memories from 14 years ago are apparently fuzzy.
---
you are very good people. We all applaud your selflessness.
---
In this subreddit really m
---
check settings
---
Pets auto stop attacking on frozen targets when they're set to defensive. This is how Classic works.
---
zzz
---
Nice. :D
---
As arms, I would strongly prefer the scepter from Princess, and it's not like you don't have to do 50 runs for your Blackstone ring anyway.  But for ret or 2H Fury it's pretty nice, they don't rely on weapon top-end damage to nearly the same degree. 
---
Not that it matters to me, 17 runs and I saw neither sword and a single pair of Vice Grips. This character was cursed from the start as far as ZF was concerned.
---
You're in for a treat. Since there are really few druids, all gear will automatically go to you.
---
"AoE Farming"
---
Lol I was farming undead by chillwind (am a warlock) and the mage AoE farming by me Pmed "You're Griefing Me, leave".
---
When all other things are equal, a slower weapon is going to have higher top end damage.
---
Not until Legion
---
It really fucking does, huh?
---
They also ganked my Warrior trying to do the Fire-Hardened Mail questline, in STM, in the Charred Vale. So I don't really pity the Horde there (despite who I punish not being the perps, sadly).
---
I quested all the way to 60 with no rested xp. You're definitely missing some quests.
---
This is sick
---
\*technically\* they got it late in Vanilla
---

---
Just do a full one there‚Äôs plenty after the j Tikal arena spam for xp and ur at level for the whole thing. Also try for LBRS
---
I'm sure people are doing it on purpose.
---
Either that or some of the stupidest people on earth are playing right now.
---
I just did a few sm gy / lib runs as a druid tank.
---
I shit you not before I even got one auto attack out the hunter and warlock in the group would burst whatever target wasnt skulled. The rogue would open on the target skulled with a stun....... and the priest healer would shield me.
---
Now how in the holy shit am I supposed to do anything? No rage from anything even after canceling the bubble. 3 targets with higher threat on the other mob so that gets a taunt. Then mr rogue is doing the right thing attacking skull however now I cant get aggro back off him because hes been hitting it the whole time.
---
Every single pack the same thing happened. Before my first auto would land some sort of aoe went out or mobs were running past me.
---
I dont even want to do dungeons anymore its driving me insane
---
I‚Äôm actually moving away from Noggen as I found it to be quite a boring server. I‚Äôm at the Zandalar Tribe character creation screen right now, horde side. Let‚Äôs see how this alt goes!
---
Could you tell me which ones you like the most? It'd help me out
---
Why even be on a pvp server than?
---
Man this is awesome! How can I download it for my phone?
---
I read it on the internet so it must be true.
---
Alright
---
So wait did they really say in their recruitment message it‚Äôs on reserve? If so what are you upset about?
---
its better for a pala
---
Wait, really? I knew there was a 'coyote' model that barked when you clicked, but didn't know Deathmaw did it! I already planned on taming it cause of the attack speed and model, so the barking is a cute bonus. :D
---
Punching down, not up.
---
Amen to that. I even spared a 26 Shaman on the Astranaar road and he followed me. I figured he may be heading in the same direction. We ran together for ~15s before the Orc Rogue got closeish and he Frost Shocked me for the Rogue to catch me. That's what really stoked my grey killing frenzy.
---
Bro im not going to continue reading these like thesis statements you keep coming up with. All im saying is ive fought plenty of warriors and the fight really isnt in our favor. Im **sure** you can come up with a scenario whenre the fight is 100% in your favor like in this one where somehow only you have engineering and theres no possible way they do or the warrior is extremely dumb or undergeared, but if the warrior isnt dumb, isnt undergeared or whatever, he's going to beat your ass in. If you didnt even know that BR can break fear, I dont know why youd keep talking as if you know the tools that a warrior has avaliable to them. Give the class a try and youll see that you fucking delete warlocks.
---
So for some further clarification:
---
I currently have the said [robe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14626/necropile-robe) equipped on my character.
---
I had already acquired it in a previous run with a different group prior to being grouped with this mage. The robes were an upgrade over what I had before. Knowing the fact that it could be an item someone else might need was something I felt worth calling him out for.
---
The first whisper I received as seen in the picture happened in the middle of fighting the very last boss of Scholomance.
---
He did not mention any items being reserved in his recruitment message (I am aware of "on res" runs as this is fairly common on this server).
---
I got swiftly booted out of the group and ignored right as the boss died.
---
Even tho both of the other classes buff the group.
---
Non meta alt time. Balance Druid or something.
---
most of my friends realized that they dont have time for this kind of gameplay and dropped off (unsubbed) before level 20
---
I agree its a dumb term. Back in the day it was simply called aoe farming!
---
Sprint blind kidney shot vanish gernade etc idk about warriors but on my rogue mages have a hard time getting poly on me
---
Camaraderie ‚úäüèª
---
You might not realise it but you reached level 60 very quickly.  In short, even without trying, you rushed to 60.
---
The bulk of people are still somewhere between 35-45.
---
Most of the people who are 60, or at least a very large proportion of them who are currently 60, are the exact kind of player who is elitist and full of themselves.
---
I know I'm generalising a lot here but I'd hazard a safe guess that most of the non-elitist players are still a long way off 60.
---
There's no way wow classic gold is $5/g. I could quit my job.
---
Yeah, the enchanting window tooltip has been out of whack for me since launch too.
---
Ok so I guess I just wasted a month just to find out now that the game is basically unplayable outside of instances, it's ok though because being unable to play the game because of fucked up server populations is the true vanilla experience. I hope blizzard introduces artificial queue times to recreate waiting for 2 hours to start playing the game.
---
Jesus Christ your dense. Why are ninjas called ninjas? Because the burst out of the shadows and take shit unexpectedly. A ninja is a person who takes loot unexpectedly by either going against the implicit loot rules of the group. People should be aware that Need if Need and BoP, all need BoE is objectively the superior set of loot rules, and it just makes shit run more smoothly. You're not entitled to 300gp just because you think the item is 'for you' and you can 'use it'.
---
What times are you playing at, either your on the faction that doesn't have many players for you are on at the wrong time because there is always someone spamming their guild. Worst case ask in chat yourself.
---
2.6 speed xD
---
Ummm there is dynamic respawn already. Mobs respawn significantly faster during high pop.
---
 Did you play on a pserver on opening week when there was 100k people? Look up a video, it was form a party of 5 and sit on a spawn point and spam AOE as the mobs spawned as fast as you could kill them.  Does that sound like a better classic experience?
---
Bored or the 'I'm so high' ones.
---
Well done letting everyone know you're not high and are actually a 12 year old pretending to be high
---
If you're talking raids there is no spec on azeroth that will make enhancement shaman so decent dps. If they are allowed to raid at all it's for buffs and nightfall.
---
Theres a shortage of tanks on most servers
---
Tclap generates almost twice as much threat as bs, but sure as a rage dump for aoe you can spam bs, but it doesn‚Äôt really hold aggro against each dps nuking a separate target
---
I'm deeply sorry that what annoys me doesn't make sense to you and will ensure to conform to your own feelings about this in the future.
---
Seriously, rezzing my pet cost me food. My pet doesn't eat fish and fishing is grindy and boring.
---
I die, I autorun and alt+tab as I do other things. With pet, I have to drink after, wait for feed effect to go away, check around to not get ganked while it happened...etc.
---
At least vending machines get paid
---
&gt; mages and warriors are the new huntards
---
all according to plan :^ )
---
agreed.  this is why bc will always be the best that WoW ever was, imo.
---
It's always fun seeing people talking about "elitist mindsets" in a post that is actively shitting on the way other people like to play :-)
---
Yeah definitely what I was going for. I just noticed that we seem to make everything a perpetual work in progress, even when we've finished something, someone comes along and tries to improve it.
---
It takes a long time to get a pet from "best friend"  happiness to run away. The hunter will probably just get tired of you and hearth. If you don't let them do that, they'll just do what any other camper player does and log off and play and alt.
---
Ok
---
Dude seriously? That fool is mass flagging people?
---
Calling BFAs story compelling has to be some sort of counter circlejerk joke right?
---
If they are in your room, they are in your house
---

---

---
Questie?
---
Hopefully the don‚Äôt take this down, they took my post down yesterday because it was just a screenshot of barrens chat.
---
That's what happens when you choose the faction that appeals to 13-year-old edgelords.
---
This one might get me shit on, but I want transmog. Even if it doesn't carry over my Vanilla-era tmog items from retail and I have to get them all back, I just want the opportunity to actually have my character look good.
---
They speak about the ridiculous amount of warnings they need to ship out on that roof.. why not stop it from being accessed?
---
The only thing with this is tanks naturally take less dmg. You might get hit for 100, the tank takes the same hit for 50. 
---
Tanks job while in leveling dungeons is to dictate the pace of the run, pull mobs efficiently and control a pull. A good tank will let that mage blizzard all over the place and take every bit of the agro. The warrior isn't going to be able to meep threat anyway. A good tank will also be taunting mobs that leave the aoe, they will slow running mobs, stun high damage targets with charge intercept and concussion blow if prot or grenades if eng. They are there to kick spells, debuff and control packs, not to sit in an aoe group of 10 mobs getting their head beat in.
---
I bought 6 months about 7 months ago in an attempt to get myself to finish through retail. Didn't work. But at least now I have a ton of time for classic. So I won't be affecting any sub numbers any time soon, especially if I forget that its recurring.
---
So the problem isn‚Äôt warriors and mages, its specifically the ones who play classic like retail. I have been running ZF a LOT, and I have been 2 hand tanking it, the difference is that I know what my group is capable of and how to compensate for that. I agree that people are idiots and wonder how some of them made it out of the starting zones, but to say that ALL warriors and mages are like this is just a disservice
---
You absolutely are entitled to a 300g epic BoE if you need it. You are absolutely not entitled to a 300g epic to get 300g out of it on the expense of someone who needs it. Wtf dude, start grinding mobs or something and make your 300g like the rest of us, no need to ninja shit off of other players
---
I mean battlegrounds will make it MUCH easier once they‚Äôre implemented but that‚Äôs going to be a little while. There‚Äôs no other way to do actual PvP. 
---
I‚Äôve seen people complain about this kinda thing, but that‚Äôs the chance you take when you choose a PvP server. Can‚Äôt pick PvP and then expect blizzard to make it easier on you, especially with vanilla. People would lose their minds.
---
Side note: Can someone explain to me why this method of running dungeons is called "Meleecleave" or "Spellcleave"? I briefly watched a video on spellcleave, and it seems to be mostly based on grouping up mobs and AOEing them down, particularly using a frost mage. So what's with the name?
---
I cannot wait for this layering shit to be gone.
---
I mean, it's absolutely doable, people just arent remotely attempting to do it correctly.
---
Imagine thinking it's the kids that don't have time to sit in a dungeon for 2 hours.
---
Give them roadhog hooks. Want to camp on a rooftop? Enjoy being pulled down.
---
Classic team &gt; BFA team.
---
Those people would have likely never posted it to reddit. Plenty of thi gas get sorted in game and never make it here.
---
As a tank if they pull before me, or a car rushs before I get more then one hit in. I go from bear to cat and let them take the damage.
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you and I said I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick. You‚Äôre 60 ahead of the curve so if you didn‚Äôt rush then you just had more play time than average then. Regardless, sorry you‚Äôre not finding the state of the game entertaining. But as someone who is still 49 I‚Äôm still having a blast.
---
I know back in the day I didn‚Äôt hardcore raid or BG and I still had a great time. Maybe give alts, world PvP, or something else a try?
---
&gt; I mean sure mage can pull a lot of threat, but how does it matter if anyone is barely taking any damage anyway?
---
This.
---
It's the tone dude. With that said, you didn't get a vote one way or the other from me. People tend to use the voting system like Facebooks like system instead of its original intent.

#ForTheHorde
---
I mean lets be honest, you are crazy if you think Blizzard would actually do anything "new" in classic over working on stuff in retail
---
Altered Snapjaw or something like that. They're all over the place in the oasis.
---
Just resubbed for another month today! I'll see how they keep it going before I'm prepared to buy 3 or 6 months at a time.
---
Question: I recently decided to ditch my previous main and start a dwarf rouge...at what point do I not miss every other attack? Currently level 16.
---
Its always like this on gaming forums. Its annoying but thats gamers for ya I guess.
---
That is without a doubt why. Blizz reacts almost instantly to reddit posts, because they are followed up with chickenshit like this.
---
literally follow a guide, don't suck at killing mobs and you are fine.
---
Quite aware of that. That's why I sealed the room up as tightly as possible. Doing all I can to handle the situation myself before having to call for an exterminator. YouTube doesn't pay as well as you would think so I've gotta try to do things on the cheap.
---
Well if you can wait until ZG there are two pets that also have a 1.0 attack speed. I think not having it and using a 1.2 attack speed pet will work just fine.
---
yea skill ceiling is very low. you can google or guess most of the talents per scenarios, the abilities are straightforward and do what they do. threat is the most complicated mechanic and there‚Äôs a meter that quantifies it, the abilities are very basic and easy to use and there‚Äôs no real movement or positioning checks besides ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be here‚Äù which is like, the base level mechanic on live but the highest level mechanic on classic
---
I hadn't played wow for 4 years before I resubbed the day before classic launch
---
You clearly watched the dueling tourneys and didn't/haven't dueled at 60.  Warlocks counter mages as hard as mages counter warriors when it comes to 1v1.
---
the  **Speed runners** played poorly and didn't even use auto loot. Joana himself said he would break his record by like almost an entire day.
---
Was, before they axed over 50% of it.
---
You know people are worried about their server's future population when they make reddit threads trying to convince people to roll/transfer there.
---
Hell yeah love me some Druid tanking
---
&gt;"fuck everyone else just play this game in a vaccum" is kind of an MSO attitude leaking into classic. I want an MMO, where everyone is welcome within reason.
---
I already stated my position on the "Just ignore them". I obviously do other stuff since I'm not invited (no shit). But I am not going to stand by and say this is a mechanic that should exist.
---
It hurts the game atmosphere and community.
---
Everytime i read stuff like this, I'm glad that I run with a mostly fixed group of friends, that are all vanilla or at least tbc veterans of the game.
---
I like his style

Id farm BRD until you get all of your pre-bis from there. That will typically take you a good level or 2 to accomplish unless you have RNGesus on your side.

i just laughed way harder than i should have
---
honestly i've only interacted with blizz employees once or twice and i've never had any bad apples. they've all been super nice, one time i was getting banned for saying some mildly problematic things in a public channel and the dude let me finish my dungeon before disciplining me. I thanked him for his service and logged off, truly a heartwarming moment
---
Ultimately they will do whatever makes them the most money
---
Rank 1 fireball is a quick cast.

If I could meet one druid tank like you it might restore my faith in druids.
---
I subbed initially just to see how blizz would flub the release, but they've actually managed it well and I'm having a lot of fun.   
---
I don't play retail so this is my first time playing wow in 3-4 years and I love the community so far. Everyone is so tight in my guild and we all help each other out. I actually care about my character
---
Can you do one of my character doing something cool? I dont know what but I want one.
---
Gotta be honest the only thing I'm learning from being low on mana with a mob on me and a couple players jumping me is just that I made a mistake being on a PvP server. 
---
It's fully my fault rolling on the server I was just really hoping I could maybe transfer to PvE but that seems out the window. Pretty sure I might be sticking to dungeons or stopping playing all together.
---
Disc priest from Fairbanks here, so to low? To low....I went into strat undead at 56 cleared up to Bal before we had to call it quits. My gear want even great. I had a few questions rewards and 2 pieces in my bis list on. You start the group, tell them to equip their trinket and trash farm rep grind. They don't have to know
---
I'm lvl 26 and i don't seem to find an appropriate quest line. 
---
I was questing at The Barren's and running WC, now moved onto SFK in the Silverpine Forest, but there are pretty much no quests for my level. (there was like one or two but even then i got no xp from killing mobs only as a quest reward.)

I don't really want to run dungeons till im lvl 60, i have really enjoyed my time questing especially at the barrens from 15-20+. What zone should i travel to to get some level appropriate quests going (where i can actually find people, Silverpine Forest dead af, i had to fly to Orgrimmar to find people to do SFK.)
---
works for ele shaman clearcasting too.  Just sit and jump right as you're taking the hit.
---
May I recommend an addon called VanasKOS.
---
Just add that guy to your Kos list and get a notification every time he is close. One of my favorite addons ever, great for world pvp.
---
Great post and I agree. I'd like to add that when tanking at these levels 2h IS actually the best way to tank these 5 mans. 
---
Pool rage, charge, sweeping strikes, berserk stance whirlwind and  berserker rage. You need as much burst threat as possible to have any kind of chance at keeping agro. At this point its your job the control the pack not necessarily tank it. Stun interrupt debuff slow etc.
---
seems like a silly reason to unsub. Couldn't you just look for non-cleave groups? plenty of them exist, none of the runs I've done have been cleave runs
---
Yeah as a mage I only take paladins now. People give a lot of shit about aoeing dungeons but pulling 2 or 3 mobs and pew pewing is so goddamn boring.
---
Lol haven't played with queue since day 3
---
I lost a Dwarven Hand Cannon last night in Strat living :(
---
I agree but I played a lot. And a majority of my time was spent LFG and just opening lock boxes in SW. The last 5 levels were just very very frustrating for me spending so long to find a group while people are searching for 3 mages for 2 hours when they could have gained a whole level running those dungeons normally.
---
But does shadow use considerably less mana than holy? Because for me the spell damage is not that important, injust apply holy fire, cast mind blast, apply sw:pain and then continue to wand them to death. Then get almost all mana back with spirit tap due to 5 second rule. I don't know how useful the 15% less damage taken is either, as holy I just heal for more so it kinda makes up and bubble absorbs most damage anyway.
---
Same for me. This game simply isn't made for casuals, no matter what people say. I can't put a stretch of time long enough to do a dungeon, so I can't hope to do anything cool. There's not a really a point to reach level 60.
---
Your welcome - Frost mages everywhere
---
It's not the current patch. Vanilla is literally just a faceroll.
---
That is the most boring shit I've ever heard.
---
How do they deal with this in retail? They have layering in retail right?
---
I have the same issue. I always quit once I accomplish 'the end'. I played MoP until I got the Cloak. I played WoD until I got the Ring. Legion until I cleared Argus on Normal... I just don't have as much patience for the Skinner Box of grinding the same content for too long, and I've made peace with that.
---
I'm sure I will continue to have a blast until that final ding and quit shortly after.
---
ANyone can tank a damn 5 mans... thats not something to brag about.
---
Pallies are shit no matter how you slice it... more to tanking than just threat. Their mitigation is the worst, they take the most dmg, have to drink every pull, healer has to spam heals constantly or they die.
---
Wow he tanked ZF while being overleleved.... yea totally means they are viable. I laugh at any ret or pally tank and never group with them
---
right asking for servers to not be 70/30 splits is just asking for easy mode. i'm sure it's an intended part of gameplay and the real vanilla experience
---
Right?
---
Yeah school has been a problem for me too. I started playing day one and I've only just gotten to level 21. It's been very slow.
---
Healer have no trouble with mana. If you do, stop fucking down ranking because it doesn't work until 60.
---
This circlejerk about Spellcleave is getting old.   
---
At this point everyone is just posting something around "spellcleave bad player" and "I refuse to grouping with spellcleaves" to farm some karma
---
We get it.
---
Actually checked the price on a few websites, pretty close to $1.8-$4.4 per server depending on server and faction.
---
At least point out the culprit
---
Sulfuras?
---
I'd love tips if you have any. I don't want to bitch and moan but most the ganking comes when I am low on mana and heath (which makes sense when else is more opportune to gank?) Most of what i try to do now is run away while healing myself to not much luck.
---
Stick on them with...what? only 3 classes minus mage itself has an interrupt. And ice shield prevents knock back so your advice is fucking bad.
---
I mean you say this, and everyone always does, but as a general rule when I've had issues with customer service and escalated it? It's been resolved in a similar manner. It's pretty rare for a company to just tell you to fuck off, even if that's what a lot of people want to believe.
---
Obviously though you don't see those things, because they aren't posted.
---
level professions, grind reputation for more mounts, help other players/your guild, world pvp, etc.   
---
there's plenty of content to complete at endgame beyond hitting 60.
---
Grats dude, looks badass
---
Probably hillsbrad
---
He finally gets to rest.
---
Druid will always have more armor then a warrior it makes up for the fact they connot block or parry
---
There's a lot of that response when it comes to fast vs. slow weapons for instant attacks. Yes there was a normalization to nerf super slow weapons at some point, but it's not correct in that it makes a fast weapon equal to a slow weapon with the exact same stats or dps. It helps to a degree.
---
Yes 100%
---
uhhhh that is hardcore? Your average joe isn't gonna hit 60 for a while. Most people are playing this game to experience the content and enjoy the lore, not to get to 60 at blazing speeds as some kind of badge of honor.
---
There's more random small talk, and the humor is slightly different.
---
How fucked are u in 2-3 months when ur server already is down to medium most of the time? I guess i will be missing out on all the fun community events and huge world pvp scrimmages, hopefully transfers will be introduced, feels terrible hitting 60 and keep grundning your character only for it to end up on a dead server.
---
The buff doesn‚Äôt stay in my one experience as someone who was MCd and buffed
---
Sure, for sure that happened. Warrior blamed rogue for not using ice nova. Great story, would read again.
---
Yeah people seriously overestimate this kind of stuff. Yeah if something really blows up then it can catch a few eyes and maybe get fixed sooner... but "something was on a forum on the internet and some people saw it" doesn't cause multi billion dollar companies to jump to action.
---
99% of the times I've escalated customer service issues like OP has had they've been resolved fairly and I've gotten an apology.
---
No don't tell them, I want them to try it
---
LBRS and upper city BRD should be just fine, otherwise there's still likely some quests around you haven't done, they like to hide when you get up to those levels lol
---
Charge - bloodrage while charging - ss - ww - berserker rage - (now choose a stance, depending on how decent the healer is, you should always get a feel for the healer while tanking / also don't switch stances if you have over 25 range, get one cleave out at least) - spam cleave untill ww is on CD.
---
Yeah I would play Ele or Enh Shaman. I've never gotten to 60. I'm not going to have time to raid either. 
---
Thats a good way to think of S Priests. Thats kind of why I think Shamans would be great, can nuke from range and hit you with an axe if you get close.
---
Not sure if you‚Äôre being sarcastic, but yes it really is. The 70/30 can go either way. They‚Äôre not going to stop people from making more characters of either faction. That‚Äôs now how it works. Again, that‚Äôs a chance you take when you pick PvP. Nobody complains if the 70/30 is in favor of their faction.
---
Attack power is normalized, weapon damage is not.
---
Shoutout fellow Kromcrushers
---
2.6 speed, isn‚Äôt that horrendous for a warrior?
---
Was not expecting that! Blew me away.
---
Might wanna look up the definition if elitism... Soapboxing for everything except the elite is not that...
---
Technically best for threat, although I still wouldn‚Äôt play one
---
except when you're fishing in booty bay and an enemy player trys to stand in front of your bobber so you right-click them next to the guards
---
Awe yiss, memories of telling my tank hes trash because he cant hold aggro against my dps.
---
fuck alliance
---
Ah yep, can see that playerbase getting frisky
---
Edgemasters can literally never be replaced tho. As good as this robe is, it will eventually be upgraded
---
So all I gotta do is stealth camp on the roof and wait for some overzealous GM to whisper me to get a free month of gametime? Sweet.
---
join channels like Looking for group and world, also look for your servers discord in most of them you can guilds recruiting on your server.
---
Even if you didnt rush in the sense of "I'm going to do everything I can to hit 60 as fast as possible," you definitely have to had played tons of hours in a relatively short amount of time. I know this because I'm trying to hit 60 as fast as I can, and I'm only level 54. And that's me playing basically any time I'm not at work.
---
What other people are saying is that there were plenty of warnings that if you are going to commit a ton of hours in a short period of time, you'll likely end up pretty bored, because, as you say, there isn't much to do in the endgame right now. So, people are reacting negatively to you not following those warnings, and then complaining afterwards. You should've at least had some idea that hitting 60 within the first month would leave you with little to do.
---
Lol right. "I've got eight days played and I can't believe I'm burned out, damn blizzard"
---
If you play 5 hours a day, which for people with 40 hour work weeks and other responsibilities is already a stretch, it would take you around 3 weeks to hit 60 with that /played.The game has been out about 1 month. The people who were clearing mc after 2 weeks were abusing layering and raid mechanics? Or playing much more than most adults would be able to.
---

---
Chests should just despawn a minute after being looted. I've cleared so many camps just to get a single piece of under-leveled food.
---
More noobs to farm at 60 imo. Let em suck, let me slaughter
---
You're so dense I cant even believe it.
---
Nice.  Way to show an underrepresented spec.  Keep em coming!
---
Anything looks cheap against a couple players who play so badly it feels like they are intentionally throwing the fight.
---
What else can they do when blizzard is their only hotkey across the bar
---
I love giving out free bags lol
---
Almost October
---
Those people were able to play a lot more. But yes they did also "abuse" some stuff probably, a lot of them hit 60 with like 3-4days played.
---
I had a group of people ranging from lvls 30 to 33 doing SM library and all we did was compliment each other on how well everyone was handling the dungeon even though some of us were 5-6 levels under the mobs. Took us about 25mins to clear. Was a swell group to run with.
---
It's orange tho!
---
It is the safer bet, than have everyone roll greed and that one guy roll need at the end
---
Did you forget to skip to  [06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFCH7jtosfI&amp;t=405s) ?
---
Multiple mages admitted it in this thread. It's comical.
---
Press enter and type "/s MESSAGE" or if you want to private message do "/w NAME MESSAGE"
---
Yes. In fact I only get about 4hrs a week.
---
Funny thing about murlocs is that I often find them one of the most aggravating enemies **regardless** of what zone they show up in. If you HAVE to interact with them for some quest then you best get ready for some pulls. The echo of *aubrgubugbugrguburgh* as you pull three or four is the sound of imminent ganking.
---
How expensive do ppl think k they can get once pop patch comes out
---
I play on smolderweb, it‚Äôs high every night. Really awesome server that is very very balanced
---
They have done things for it ... it‚Äôs called PVE now stop bitch‚Äôn and join one of those
---
So I ended up purchasing a shadow hood (not the shadoweave one) and the weave legs and have already noticed a difference in dps. Not much loss in survivability or downtime due to lost stats. I'll find out tomorrow how the chest does compared to my robes of arugal. Also plan on joining that discord to discuss the warlock ways. Thanks for the input y'all!
---
You son of a... I love it!
---
After or before works but you have to be in berserker stance to us it while CC'd
---
Woah, because greed *never* turns people you thought were reasonable into not reasonable people lmao
---
On the other hand, I used the horn and someone else tagged the mob first. Unfortunately, the horn is a one-time-use item, so I had to abandon the quest and go get it again. That was pretty frustrating.
---
and we have an entire genearation of edgelords now, so most likely horde will be the favored faction now, which sucks because alliance races suck, and while im a horde at heart,  if the majority of the playerbase its horde ill have to pick alliance, the more targets to kill in PVP the better.
---
Stalagg alliance here, I feel your pain bud
---
How dare you
---
U are the scum of earth. Really.
---
Are u proud?
---
My man!
---
This is what classic is all about!
---
That's how it worked...that's how it's always been. People act as if Vanilla people were carefree and whimsical and never cared for anything. Not true at all.
---
Yep. I 2h tank all the time. But I don't start doing that until I'm about 5 levels past the minimum. Regular tanking at minimum usually isn't *too* bad. It can get a little rough with bosses.
---
Noooooooo
---
Because everyone needs the Krol blade
---
Lol I agree actually. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be upset if someone didn‚Äôt tip me but if someone gave me 5s it almost seems worse than not tipping at all.
---
at least your groups actually use the icons, I keep finding groups that just randomly pull shit and then apply DPS to whatever the fuck they want while complaining things don't die fast enough.
---
I mean... I feel okay about it.
---
You sound lame af
---
And then a few days later, this warning will appear telling you to activate it.
---
Was this on bigglesworth? I see him there from time to time haha
---
Fuck horde
---
Are all EU players delusional or is it just you?
---
Leatrix in combination with LortiUI
---
It really depends on your class and professions, but I'll try answer in a general sense.
---
Typically the most important thing when you get ganked is making sure your health is up, and that you can try get to some safety or distance from your pursuers. It's common for people to give up if the effort in killing someone exceeds more than a few minutes or so (Though I've had people chase me across entire regions). 
---
If you can separate them, then that's the best because there's usually a chance to take someone down 1v1. If your class has any CC or disrupts/stuns, try land one of those before running for it. 
---
Racials can be lifesavers in PvP, remember to use things like WoTF, Escape Artist or Stomp if the opportunity arises.
---
Abuse the shit out of Line-of-sight, make sure that none of the casters can ever get a 2-3 second spell off you, this can be tough in open wilderness, but sometimes you get lucky and can turn a corner around some ruins or a building.  
---
The most important thing is not to panic, I have a bad tendency of slamming buttons when ganked by rogues and blowing something that I could have used to save my ass. 
---
That being said, if you are very on low HP/Mana and 3-4 rogues or something come to gank you, chances are you are dead in the water.  
---
Just remember that if you get killed in PvP that there's no 10% durability loss, it's just the walk back that costs you.
---
As a tank, I hate that mages, locks, and even melee classes just unload as soon as something it pulled. I have no rage, AoE aggro is already harder to get than single target, and now I have to run around meaning Im getting no block. I get that it is faster, but at some point its gotta be too much for a regular, non-epic group, and thats when things start wiping. Nobody respects sheep, nobody gives a damn about understanding rage, things are just blow it up and hope it blows up.
---
As someone who played for years on both Horde and Alliance, I've always found it a bit silly how they say they exact same crap about each other, and it persists to this day. I guess most people stick to one faction and don't see the other side acting exactly the same way, but neither faction is any different than the other when it comes to particular behaviors.
---
Honestly, I was deciding between mage and hunter and went with hunter. I think I made the right decision. So many mages and I hate the meta of spellcleave. I enjoyed having to "figure out" my rotation for dungeons. Like how do I manage my mana to do the most damage? Plus having to manage your pet makes group content a ton of fun with a lot of moment to moment decisions.
---
You can Frostbolt into an instant Fireblast without losing any GCd
---
Best to use right before you have to move, so Frostbolt &gt; Fireblast &gt; Move
---
Depends on your +spellpower, build and equipment... But in a general sense adding a Fireblast in between attacks should increase your DPS.
---
not sure why you're telling us this
---
Okay, picture this.
---
I'm on the last section of The Missing Diplomat. I spend an hour running around DWM looking for this "Hendel" fellow, but can't find him. A player in chat tells me where he was, turns out he's been spending 99% of his time dead, so he's easy to miss. Well I go there, and three minutes later he spawns. I die like a bitch the first time of course (level 34 warrior), and it's a LONG corpse run back. 
---
So I get back there, and he's respawned, but I'm busy trying to figure out how to redo the quest when another player runs up. I ask them about the quest, they say nothing, go up to Hendel, aggro him, and immediately both of his adds target me, when I'm still halfway through typing a message. So I die again, and they get their quest finished.
---
So I get back there, and figure out to abandon the quest and re-accept it off him. I wait five minutes for the respawn, and when he respawns I go up to talk to him. And while the quest text is slowly scrolling through, a pair of players run up, and one insta-accepts the quest, which I didn't even know was possible. So again, they all insta-aggro on those players, Hendel is insta-tagged so I still can't do the quest, can't even accept it now, and I end up fighting for my life again, having to help the player who just stole my quest.
---
So I'm sitting there waiting for him to respawn AGAIN, and he does, and I die again. I'm trying to do the thing where you lure his buddies back to some guards to kill them, but I die on the way.
---
So I get back there, attempt #5, and again, a player arrives at the camp while I'm waiting for the respawn. I /say "Missing Diplomat quest?", they respond "Ye". I ask "Want to party?", they don't respond. Hendel spawns, I run up to him *immediately* and the quest text starts rolling. The other player runs up while I'm in the conversation, somehow immediately accepts the quest like the other players, and all the mobs aggro me again like in the first instance. I've just spent an hour and a half in DWM trying to do this ONE PART of the quest, so I'm not happy, I windows task manager rage quit then and there.
---
I was about to make a MUCH MUCH angrier post on reddit, until I do a quick google search out of curiosity, and it turns out yeah, "Instant quest text" is apparently an option that can be turned on. I just never knew about it, and that's how all those players could steal the quest while I was waiting for the text to scroll.
---
I mean, I'm still angry, but now I feel stupid and angry.
---
I honestly dont care about your opinion, mr ninja
---
It's hard to find actual numbers. The only thing I've seen cited so far has been a patch note from 1.11 that says -5g per month to a minimum of 10g for the respec.
---
Just create your own dungeon grps?
---
Look at it like that. You wont ever have mages in a grp saying "omfg this xp/hr is horrible" or "this isnt a aoe xp farm?!" after youve clearly said in lfg channel: "lfm dps. Brd prison+arena" 
---
Trust me 99% of those aoe farmers are the biggest noob and noobs are not elitists. Theyre just noobs. 
---
(they also spend 1hr to lf that third mage to be 5min faster instead of getting some other dps instantly)
---
Yeah sorry, was using my phone. And I have the English skills of a 14 year old.
---
Assuming you mean max level right now, everything has massive fire res. So yes it will be a dps loss.
---
Yes you should
---
You'll  still end up with the same average dps, the faster one will be more consistent.   You're ignoring the really crits by the slower pet offsetting less frequent  crits.  There will also likely be fights where your slow bet doesn't  get dodged or parried at all since there's less attacks.  There's a reason to like fast attack speed pets, but your argument just shows you don't understand basic probability.
---
Cant really find the point youre trying to make here captain
---
Polymorph.
---
Are you ready for some more coffee chugging? join me on twitch, champion  [https://www.twitch.tv/dog\_monk](https://www.twitch.tv/dog_monk)
---
In practice i beat warriors probably 85% of the time. I honestly just feel youre doing something wrong if they are autolosses for you. 
---
Im not coming up with theory crafting scenarios, im trying to understand why you would just get deleted. The only way that happens is if they get lucky crits, just like any other burst class. 
---
There is really no class that a lock is just helpless against, its not like mages vs warriors. We have tough match ups for sure, but any fight is winnable.
---
Uhm.. So.. What?
---
This is hilarious every time I see it.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
I usually dont play with NA or assholes in general so I cant really verify your point
---
It's funny... When original wow came out, I generally played very competitively against the other faction--ganking, stalking, even corpse camping. I had a blast doing it too (though I was generally nice to people in my faction).
---
Now, however, I have a wife, mortgage, three kids and a 9-5 job. I find myself helping the red guys survive in the open world instead of griefing them, and you know what, I'm having a blast doing it. (I'll still take vicious retribution against people that do me wrong though. They don't know where I've been, they don't know what I've *done*.)
---
Oh and yeah dude, fuck gnomes.
---
I've seen a warlock hellfire a single target...
---
Not sure about that. I've only ever been corpse-camped as Horde unfortunately. Impossible to tell which faction has the most assholes really.
---
So Europeans are racist. Good to know :)
---
Hahahahah sonfucking true
---
The world PvP is by far my favorite thing in classic. It's what creates the adventure and the excitement. Sometimes it should be passed up. Don't wipe folks doing an elite quest etc. I'm excited when I get ganked because now there's chips on the table. High level ganker? Form a milita with general chat then go hunt him down and camp him. Maybe that ends up snowballing into a raid group that runs around STV for two hours killing every Ally we can find even the 60's they try to call in. These are things that get me excited in classic.
---
Nothing is getting buffed or nerfed. The game is exactly as it was in vanilla...except layering
---
Were gunna do the sealed for a bit, dnd after. But a few of my buddies/brothers are gunna buy a box and do an in home draft for the card that comes with the box.
---
Just because you can kill the opposing faction doesn't mean you have to
---
Breaks if you (the applier) or the target (the receiver) takes damage.
---
Looks good. One thing I do miss from retail is the character highlight when you self-target/F1. Have to hover over your faceplate to brighten things up.
---
Most people see YouTube videos and guides showcasing how busted mags and warrior are so most of the brain dead people play them.
---
#nochanges
---
Thank you!
---
Corpsemaker. High drop rate, amazing itemization.
---
First of all fuck you, you can be an Arms tank if you use Shield like you're supposed to if you're tanking, so stop chastizing the arms tank spec.. And second of all yes, aoe spammer idiots are not learning the game properly and they will suck ass in future content and Bg's let them be stupid, we orcs will smash them.
---
Well, that was quick
---
Priest: "Go get em champ"
---
Name checks out.
---
I feel like I had a similar event. I just wanted to turn in my SM quest and vendor that axe, but the Horde decided to obliterate South shore. So I decided to kill Evey single questing hordie in hillsbrad.
---
YES Serra Angel guide me
---
I can tell you with absolutely certainty that at least 50% of the people that have played classic are gone.
---
After two months, that'll be 95%.  Minor bumps for major content additions in the future.
---
Doesn't mean classic is going away, relax.
---
I was nervous with 72g at like 37. At 40 I had 115. It REALLY picked up
---
So... how did you actually resolve it? You left that part of the story out
---
Very interesting and solid ass analysis. Thank you.
---
alright lemme just use the server transfer feature that only exists for overpopulated servers
---
What are these 'quests' you speak of? All I know is spellcleave
---
You are a complete dick bag and would have made me simultaneously howl and  laugh hysterically for at least five minutes. 
---
That really was awesome. Now I hope you get hunted daily.
---
Not as fun when peaceful is the norm
---
after reaching the island with 4 elementals, take care as to avoid their aggro, or take em on. The distance between the island and destination is easier than the wall to the island, thats for sure.
---
An efficient played time to 60 is something like 5-6 days.
---
You could have played 4 hours a day during the week and 8 hours a day on weekends easily with a full time job. And that is on the high end of time played to 60. It wouldn't even be a sweat if you are doing 4.5-5d played.
---
&gt;Does the channel of bandage break if the person I am healing takes damage? I always thought it would only break if *I* took damage?
---
If either person takes damage, the bandaging stops.
---
&gt;Also, on a side note, can anyone help me find the location of the final healing pot/ mana pot?
---
Assuming you mean recipe, they're sold by vendors. One is in Winterspring, I think the other was in Western/Eastern Plaguelands.
---
I dont know if makes me a better person but at least a better player
---
Well I guess you‚Äôre Sh** outta luck. &lt;SOL&gt;
---
Wow! Another armchair developer who knows what‚Äôs better for the game than blizzard!
---
&gt;I've come to the conclusion that mages and warriors are the new huntards.
---
Holy fuck *thank you*.  I've been saying for weeks now that mages are the new hunters.  [This is my standard interaction with every mage post-60.](https://clips.twitch.tv/AverageCleverPresidentCmonBruh)
---
YEAH!  Couldn't you waste your time trying to sort through impatient unemployed millennials pretending this method of running dungeons is worth doing?
---
They've restricted server transfers for specific factions to balance things before. Why not again?
---
Were there a lot of people that subbed at launch, without question, but the reality is a fuck ton of people subbed the two weeks prior, if there was going to be some massive die off after month one we'd already be seeing it.  Instead I still have a 1-2 hour queue on Herod at prime time every night.
---
The die off will not happen, assuming it does, after a specific date.  I do think around 3 month mark will be a better test, but that will also depend on when P2 comes out.  So many people are going to take months to hit 60.
---
I do think they should give us a time frame for at least the next phase.
---
You can tank without a shield you just can‚Äôt do it as an ape.
---
I don't freeze trap warriors or druids. I immolation trap them. 1,200 over 15 works plenty fine.
---
Arrogance doesn't make you better it just makes you think you're better
---
Always 1% chance to miss for casters I think.
---
there is no real way to force people tp transfer or roll on a server
---
if they open transfers off a heap will just leave
---
I started two weeks ago and this is my first experience ever, and I'm not sure if I'll resub... because I'm not sure I can manage life and wow at the same time.

I ran a twink guild for a good while. Had a good core group of about 25 *geared* 19 twinks.

This was just before xp gain in bgs and the xp off switch. 
---
I made such a great group of friends in that guild, we all spent hours upon hours, days, weeks, months helping each other farm... STV arena trinkets, endless WC and VC runs, fishing contests.
---
The 19 bracket is really all about having fun in WSG and occasionally arena. Was fun to see people get 100k hk titles, and quirky stuff like a 19 twink named Dora -The Explorer.
---
It was a game within a game, and fun on tap, until they ruined it all. I managed to collect every WSG achievement on my 19 pally fc.
---
Have you played WoW even?
---
Not mage, a lock instead, but I just manually mark anything I cc. But the macro idea is good and I might have to use it
---
Can someone ELI5 What layering is/how it works /how i can use it? TIA
---
That‚Äôs transfers. Transfers aren‚Äôt even open yet except the free ones to balance overall population. They won‚Äôt do anything until all of the phases are out, especially Battlegrounds, which is 6 months to a year out at least.
---
Well I mean I am better so whether or not I think about it that way doesnt really change it you know
---
SPELLCLEAVE is basically just spellcasting aoe spam. I.e. 2 or 3 mages, a priest, and a warlock. Mass pulling groups and just aoeing them down. It's the most annoying spam in trade and LFG chat I've seen so far. You'll see SPELLCLEAVE LF2 Mages SM Cath SPELLCLEAVE
---
HAHAHAHA
---
‚ÄúRES ME U FUCK‚Äù
---
Same!
---
No I haven't, what's that do?
---
Yea sry not sry that my experience isn't ruined by overpop so you can mindlessly fight to "defend" something with 0 reward
---
We should really just get a Classicwow Confessions thread. *cries in guilt*
---
sorry just got on laptop. that prior msg was on phone. Didnt notice all the weirdness in it.
---
Dat debuff slot tho
---
How's the pop balance? I hear horde is massively under played there. Im on grobb(best server in my opinion) but saw the option to xfer a few weeks back. Curious how the realm turned out
---
I leveled a lock on a pserver to 60 early last year, I knew I was 100% down for this, I did the same.
---
There are people not 60 and still leveling fast. Not everyone has 12 hours a day to play.
---
Narc!
---
I am probably on alot of kill lists now for questing with a couple of rogues in Feralas who couldnt resist killing any alliance we passed by while questing. Granted I could have left the group but questing as a holy priest solo is a pain in the ass and I was already in too deep with the rogues to claim innocence.
---
Leading and MTing my own guild on a pve server. We cleared mc and onyxia, and I'm having a blast. There's still lots to do for me. I don't have cooking or fishin at 300, engineering's only at 250 too, I could still get a few gearpieces here n there...
---
I'll be fine for a while. And if all else fails, I can level an alt in preparation for pvp.
---
Sensu bean?
---
Pretending to want to do something else.
---
My friend linked his damage after a wipe in brd showing he did 50% of the damage. I then followed it by linking the targets he did his damage to, 80% being the boss which was the lowest priority target because of the 4 or 5 adds that come with the boss + the pat of 3 dogs + the group we got feared into.  Where as if he actually dpsed the targets as marked instead of tunneling the boss all the adds would have been dead before we got feared into an extra pack and we could have recovered.. some people just like to see their name on top of dps and don't realize the negative effects it has
---
Nice, thanks :D
---
I literally googled ‚Äúignorant definition‚Äù LOL
---
So what about winterspring?
---
Not until the /train. That was just salt in the wound. Bad and hilarious.
---
It‚Äôs mainly for cross server to artificially populate the world... Because the game is so dead and trash.
---
Gratz man
---
If people simply focused the same target none of this would be an issue. If you are a warrior dps I kind of get wanting your own mob to build rage... but why must every class try to be a hero and solo there own mob?!?!
---
True, but at the same time they also aren't the types of players to pay much attention to when their sub/gametime expires. If the didn't resub today, it's probably because they'd already stopped playing sometime in the past couple of weeks.
---
Fair enough. I‚Äôve only seen them underleveled doing it. But, they were very unaware of mana or pulls and the strain it was putting on they entire group.
---
BM hunters raiding, lul ok bud.
---
20/31/0 doesn't even get to the frenzy talent. Try actually hitting 60 with your Hunter before spouting nonsense.
---
Honestly, the best way is just to find people doing similar quests or people in dungeons, inviting them to a group, then chatting to them and getting to know them. It's a bit of a daunting process, especially if you have anxiety dealing with new people, but the more you do it, the better you get and the more comfortable you feel chatting to new people. 
---
Never be afraid to ask questions or for assistance, the majority of WoW players are more than happy to help and generally have an amazing wealth of knowledge. If someone is unpleasant to interact with or being rude, add them to your /ignore list and move on, they're not worth your time and unfortunately there is a decent amount of players like this.
---
The most important thing is if you meet someone you had a good experience with, add them to your friends list. You might not talk to them or see them for a while, but every now and then you'll interact with them and remember the good interactions, and it's likely they will too.
---
All of the WoW friends I've met were randoms while questing/dungeoning that were good people to talk to, that's all it really takes to make a good friend.
---
Faerlina actually and plot twist hes a streamer with 100 or so viewers
---
"You dropped this."
---
Not really a problem of spellcleave(which definitely is a problem by itself) but I would say it's a problem of modern gaming overall.
---
Games tend to be more accessible and all of its difficulties are generally around responsiveness and reaction, action games overall like mobas, BFA, overwatch, royal arena or whatever.
---
When we talk about classic and others old rpg games you would need to develop a much deeper learning and testing and waaaay less time on the action/reaction time, let's be real, classic pve is extremely easy in comparison to the last 4 expansions on retail, which doesn't mean classic is worse or better, just different.
---
Tanks being too fucking dumb is why I choose to spellcleave lol
---
You say that, everyone I've met that is a jerk online is a jerk irl.
---
Maybe not as openly but snide pointless comments over how bad someone is at their job (e.g. Table staff, random coworker etc), crappy punching down jokes, bully when they can get away with it and so on.
---
I'm still trying to comprehend if this is a master troll or he really thinks it's good.
---
The writing has been kind of retarded lately. And by lately I mean years.
---
Wrong wrong wrong
---
MM will out dps BM in MC before a single GS drops.
---
&gt;1. You guys say the word retard way too much, relax.    
---
  
---
Yet you used the word "huntard." Where do you think that word came from? ^^^I ^^^think ^^^OP ^^^is ^^^^^^retarded.
---
Lmfao.
---
Is the best way to get these by donating cloth?
---
someone already made this joke little fella
---
Why unplayable?
---
Alliance are friendly when it's convenient for them, not to actual morals
---
If I have mace spec on warrior and I use whirlwind, is there a chance that all the enemies affected get stunned? Or just the primary target; or none at all?
---
So there's actually 2 main aoe comps. Melee cleave and spell cleave. It'd be weird to show up for an aoe group of the wrong type, hence they have different terms.
---
So many people try to justify their ninja looting.
---
Happy cake day! Thanks for the info :D
---
Just wanna quickly add, that without improved renew talent for priest, renew is not more mana efficient than a standard heal of equivalant rank. But i would still throw one at a warlock! Improvef or not.
---
Commonly called a "KOS list" or a "Shit List"
---
And absolutely, if you are ever wronged in some way, it's your responsibility to find the offending party, hunt them down, and make life hell for them.
---
Yep! Pretty much after Primal Fury / Predatory strikes, you can jump and get OOC / Furor before swapping back.
---
Yeah I regret transferring there as horde to be honest.  Just hit mid 30s and STV / Hillsbrad is a fucking nightmare.
---
No problem. Someone in that thread mentioned the cat lady meme template and I knew I had to do it to 'em.
---
Suppose I should have used context, I dont shapeshift out so I just remain frozen and let them assume I'm a dummy
---
‚ÄùYeah dude cool sword and all but I really need the gold yo so im not ninjaing this k thx cya gg‚Äù
---
Same with me, I got my lock to 60 but feel like I should've leveled my hunter to 60 instead, always loved hunters and should've stuck with it. O well he's level 26 so it isn't so bad plus leveling will be a bit quicker now that I know where to go and what quests to skip.
---
What the. Fuck is spellcleave?
---
I'm on the side with far less, was able to beat most of the pack so I am ahead of the curve. Had to put down a 60 mage earlier at 57 because he was ganking 50's.
---
This isn't an error.  Baros Alexston is unaware the king is missing, which is why he tells you deliver a message to him.
---
All the forsaken in game are the last remnants of the human population of lordaeron after the scourge destroyed it in warcraft 3. I think BFA has night elf forsaken but i don't really remember
---
I could say the same about Alliance
---
I hear what you're saying, but I play a warrior tank. If I had 35% damage taken over the course of a gnomer run I'd hang up my beard.
---
Retail vanilla to current day servers have never been faction balanced. Why would that change for classic?
---
I dont know but thank the gods wow didnt have playable undead elves at release. There are already far too many weebs without that mess.
---
You will severly limit yourself if you only group with people you know in game unless you find a bunch of people who play on the same server and faction in this subreddit which is very unlikely. 
---
Most of players are just regular people who want to enjoy the game just like yourself. Don‚Äôt pay attention to all the horror stories. Its not too bad. Just try grouping up with random people a few times. You will be fine
---
That's like my dps rotation lol.  Maybe I just don't have the gear for it, I find if I don't switch to defensive stance and start tab sundering, I'm going to lose threat like 3-5 seconds after the first ss ww
---
Thinking about making a Hunter but I'm not interested in using bows at all. Am I going to be forced to use marksman talents for endgame content?
---
Full time job, on call after hours, SO, kids, stuff to do on weekends, wasted 1st week in queues, then changed server.
---
36 priest leveling with a mate, 225 tailoring skinning fishing cooking. 20 hunter and 16 mage played in non duo time. Play 3 hours ish most nights.
---
&gt;#notallmages
---
Yeah, mages are mostly gnomes.
---
I know a sneakyjack....
---
Fair play. Admitted the mistake and even made up for the inconvenience, good customer service 101.
---
&gt; How fucked am i in 2-3 months when the main hype died down and ur server already is medium most of the time?
---
Considering they're planning on removing layering, and current servers have a capacity about 4x higher than the original Vanilla servers, you'll probably be fine in a medium server.
---
&gt; I guess i will be missing out on all the fun community events and huge world pvp scrimmages, hopefully transfers will be introduced, feels terrible hitting 60 and keep grinding your character only for it to end up on a dead server.
---
I can't really say what it's like on your server, but I used to play on a relatively quiet US server during Oceanic times, which meant that I usually played at low/medium times. You could always find groups, PvP or action if you were interested, but it was less than it would be during peak hours on a fully capped server.
---
Once Honor Kills come out, I wouldn't worry too much about finding PvP.
---
Yeah I'm sorry but no questing ever gets close to 100k XP/HR
---
I think I read 5g reduction per month - no lower than 10g to respec.
---
Thank you for taking the time to type all that out! 
---
In real life, I have to meet strangers constantly under the worst circumstances as I‚Äôm a funeral director, so in normal daily life, I don‚Äôt have anxiety talking to new people....I think maybe I‚Äôm just drained by the time I play WoW some days and can‚Äôt see facial expressions to gauge or just talk to people vocally. 
---
But your advice makes sense. I‚Äôm gonna have to meet people just out and about. I‚Äôve gotten a couple weird interactions here and there so far but have....5 friends. Haha. My husband, a real life friend, and a few random people that I talked to under just the circumstances you described. 
---
Happy questing and thanks!
---
Curse of Tongues, Spellstones, and Felhunter completely fuck a mage's ability to do much of anything except die quickly.
---
...why are you bragging about beating people who are green level relative to you? surprised this is so highly upvoted
---
If this was stealing from your own side... yes. But imo this is what wow is about. Screwing the other side as much as possible.
---
So they ruin the entire game, killing off the financial aspect, get completely outfitted in end game bis raid gear that‚Äôd take literally hundreds of hours to get, and they get a shitty 30 day ban?
---
Wow.  If that‚Äôs the extent, everyone should abuse the hell out of every major bug.
---
Stonetalons, Ashenvale and Thousand Needles are the 3 areas the majority of Horde funnel into after Barrens. The fact that quests make you go in all three directions multiple times at different levels means that they will always be alot of horde in those area.
---
Its around 55/45 in favor of alliance. May be closer to 60/40
---
It's pretty much the only PvP server that favors alliance.
---
Playing from Japan instead of usual united states. No issues, no ban.
---
Amazing, good job

The guards at Ratchet have bows, why do our Goblin brethren in Gadget get the shaft when it comes to equipment?!

"My experience is the only experience that matters!" Amirite?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre disagreeing with me or not. 4 hours a day during the week + 8 hours a day on weekends is 36 hours a week. That‚Äôs more than a part time job. If that‚Äôs not hardcore, then I shudder to imagine what hardcore is.
---
I tried to skin him twice
---
I'll only lifetap to 70% then bandage when the fight is over. Healthstone, potion or drain life if needed.
---
I could bite the whole god damn world with this thing.
---
What did you do exactly ?
---
Hellfire will do far more dps, the main issue is actually sustain, never mind the whole killing yourself part
---
I don't want layering, but dude there is *massive* lag when shit like this happens, it's cool but genuinely annoying
---
Clean your bed kid
---
My husband told me I‚Äôm taking memes on here too seriously after I told him tonight, ‚ÄúThey make fun of mages all the time‚Äù and felt embarrassed. Lol. 
---
Thank you! He‚Äôll make me group with random people at times so maybe it really just takes me being more comfortable.
---
Creating sort of sub-servers within a single server. So there might be 3 different instances of Orgrimmar on a server. If you show up you'll only see people in the same layer as yourself. You can switch layer by grouping with someone on another layer.
---
We meta now bois
---
NPCs have always used textures that have clothing baked in and all the relevant display info except for weapons and (I think) helms and shoulders, which are stored server side.
---
No, it depends on if you can hit the 9% hit cap required for the MM/Surv build or not. If you can, then yeah MM will out dps the BM build but if you arent at hit cap then your pet will be more valuable than you are.
---
This makes it twice as spicy!
---
I feel like if you camp lowbies constantly you deserve whatever comes to ya haha
---
Let the spin to win commence!

Awesome. I‚Äôm in this guild and saw you guys getting ready to do it. Glad it was successful üòÄ
---
My friends and I are confused about the group loot system outside of dungeons. Which loots are shared and which loots are specific to individuals. From our observations, money, quest drops and mob loots (meat and fur) are specific to individuals and cannot be looted by the group whereas crafting material and equipments are shared by the entire group? Anyone know the actual system behind this? Where does bag/ sack fall under?
---
Would never steal resources from same faction like that but if I see some alliance going for my thorium they are gonna catch hands
---
It really is the best part of being a human in wow. The hidden racial ability.
---
Makes you wonder how they "checked" and "confirmed" rbg trading when you never even entered a rbg... maybe if they just did their fucking job and actually checked the fact that your character never entered a rbg they'd correct it immediately rather than phoning it in and lying about doing any due diligence whatsoever. We should not praise them for doing less than the bare minimum.
---
Negativity bias. People tend to remember and tell a lot more about the negative experiences they've had than the positive ones.
---
Plus, why would people cheer what should be the status quo?
---
&gt;This is fandom, those posts would get upvoted way up.
---
You clearly haven't seen the WoW fandom. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY hates Blizzard more than Blizzard fans.
---
Isnt salad bakers the ninja guild tho.
---
Honestly been tanking on my shaman a lot while leveling. Was playing my lower level warrior and was sorta missing shaman.

Lol hunters talking smack about other classes' intelligence. The times they are a changing

GLORY TO THE SIN DOREI

It's ONLY value is to Paladins. It has the [Destiny] treatment. Too fast to be good for a Warrior. Too fast to be good for Seal of Command. It is truly strong if you go seal of righteousness. Do that and it will be amazing. Human paladins would get the +5 sword skill too. It's amazing for them.

At least he made it obvious that you should add them to ignore

the catlady meme is my favorite, the face of the cat is purrfect
---
Did somebody say...
---
Does anyone know what addon he's using to get the party frames to be like that?
---
yes layering is still in effect. 
---
yes in phase 2 it will be removed.
---
Had the something similar happen for molten core, get told the day before if i could come tank ( turned down a extra shift to make the raid) spend 200g getting myself in the best possible spot i can gear/consumable wise. Get to the raid and RL tells me tank gear is on reserve for their guild even tho i was asked to main tank it :(.
---
The gifted game time seals the deal. Blizz definitely saw the Reddit post.
---
I'll practice running back to my corpse now.
---
Thankyou! So, how would I get about going to a different layer? General chat abs asking to join a different group?
---
Play what you want, as long as you're good you will succeed.
---
r/thathappened
---
Not my style to start a group.  I'll join on anyone wanting a tank, but I don't like forming the group.  
---
Even went as far as getting the non-classicy LFG addon to help watch multiple chat channels.
---
I downranked all my shit at that level, did just fine 
---
You good?
---
That's true but my point was more that this kind of response from a customer service is entirely standard and I've seen it basically every time a CS team has fucked up. I seriously doubt any special action was taken due to a screenshot being online, as the truth is *literally nobody* quit the game over it.
---
A few people who no doubt already had a "fuck blizzard" attitude got another little tidbit to throw around, everyone else went "eh that sucks" and immediately forgot about it. 
---
Not to mention if you go and look on twitter or other unmoderated places, blizzard has hate thrown at them 24/7 by all kinds of people without needing any reason to do so.
---
Basically yeah.. having stuff like that hit the top of this sub isn't *great* for them but it's not "OH SHIT FIX IT QUICK GOGOGO" issue that people think it is.
---
Fuck I loved this shit back in the day.
---
Lul...

---
Greys, whites, and quest items all belong to the person who is able to loot the corpse. If they and don't loot everything, other party members can loot. Depending on loot threshold, you have to roll on green and rarer items.
---
Yes!! Was hoping you would do this!
---
It's not just wotf. Tremor totems also nullify fear, and group pvp matters more than 1v1.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what this image is of.
---
I agree with Spell cleave being an issue but you cannot stop people from grouping for the most efficient way to clear a dungeon.   
---
For instance, I joined a group as a SMF warrior. I was berated for doing something enjoyable and fun to play rather than playing boring Arms warrior. Despite out damaging others on trash (47 warrior at the time out damaging a 55 rogue!), people are to obsessed with "meta" roles to enjoy the game, I believe this is a byproduct of the past few expansions with needing to min max the game rather than enjoying it. Frustrating but w/e

Nothing will ever top when BWL was released. The hallway before the portal was absolute chaos.

You wouldn't post this unless you were proud of your behaviour. This just tells me you're an asshole who thinks they are cool because you're doing it in a video game not irl. 
---
Shit behaviour is shit behaviour, stop trying to justify it because of where it occurs.
---
Mages and warriors go beyond the new huntard because a lot of these mages and warriors have quite literally never played WoW before and think they know what they are doing because they've joined groups where 3 mages blast everything to death without a shred of thought.
---
A lot of people have unrealistic dreams of being the best in the world and let little things like wow classic race get in the way of them having fun. Just because you don't like the way something sounds doesn't mean you're wrong or I'm correct.
---
If you ignore everything that is factual and respond only with your feelings then you're just as bad as someone who is more blunt than they should be.

Some dude and his expert kiting skills I suppose.

The bug made the game unfair. They fixed the bug.

You want to make the game unfair because you missed out.

Australians enjoy having a whinge. It's a national pastime.

Frost easily out DPS fire while lvling, with practically 0 crit gear you'll rarely have ignites going. And of course frost also brings all the useful CC and ice block which will save you multiple times while lvling. You can also shatter anything while lvling, which is another huge bonus for frost.
---
You can play however you want, just don't think you're doing more dmg as fire while lvling compared to frost. Fire is heavily gear dependent to actually be good.

If serious, it‚Äôs because the Dark Portal blasted the land

Rotation is super easy. Send in VW. Agony, Corruption, Siphon life. Life tap to get back to full mana, life drain to get back to full Hp. Wand is great for lower levels but after about 40 drain life seems to be the better option. This also gives you a fair bit of gank protection as you are nearly always topped off - and if things get hairy you can sacrifice your VW for a GG EZPZ win

There is one thing I don't doubt and that's blizzards customer service.  At least in my experience it's way better than most in MMOs and gaming in general.
---
sorry reading comprehension is lost on you.. once again it has nothing to do with rushing
---
I would normally agree but there‚Äôs something going on with pets at the moment in classic. Lots of reports of pets with full happiness and level 5 loyalty still running away. It hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet so I can‚Äôt confirm the circumstances but I‚Äôve heard about it loads.
---
That would be expertise (which is not even a thing afaik...)
---
Its because all the low skilled players who blindly follow what some youtuber said rolled a mage and warrior... because they are the best class!  Instead of following their heart and picking a class they enjoy.  So they are stuck playing a class because its "good" and have to resort to aoe groups that are filled with the same type of players.

Where are the server discords?

i transferred to heartseeker and im pissed there is way too many alliance

Last night I (45 feral druid) ran uldaman with a 46 warrior, 43 warlock, 46 mage, and a 40 holy priest. Warrior didn't use a shield until last boss. I half tanked the instance. It was weirdly effective. I can understand why people like this cleave stuff. I think you were just playing with an idiot. As long as players can improvise, adapt, and overcome this game is straight forward.
---
OK that actually makes tons of sense, yeah.
---
There's even arena comps later that people call "spell cleaves" (like LSD) or "melee cleaves" (like TSG).
---
And I'll stand here and heal your glorious suicidal ass any day.

Meh, I run up to allies all the time and /lick them in pooch form.  Told guildies of once instance that was a wholesome interaction where a gnome rogue patted me on the head.  Guildies proceed to flame me endlessly until I just /gquit on the spot.  So as much as I want to refute you, you ain't wrong about most of them being dicks.

That said I've seen more alliance gang up on horde than horde gang up on Alliance, but that's just what I've seen.

Ummm... I guess there is quite a bit to it. the actualy rotation is not complicated really. The spec is more important I think if you want to push past ST (maybe some other shaman tanks can correct me). I could post a guide maybe? Its saturated but in the leveling context I think I do quite a bit different.  
---
my spec  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfzVchoZVVbzixz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfzVchoZVVbzixz)

my 'rotation'

 rank 1 LB (just to try and proc clearcasting) 
---
CL 
---
see who still needs threat after CL and apply rank 4ish ES 
---
apply rockbiter as you see necessary
---
 wait for focus -&gt; cast CL againo and max rank ES when needed

but things change as you level and you may need to adapt some things

Yup, had that too happen before 2FA was a thing. My wow sub was long unrenewed, but it was my Diablo 3 character who got all farmed up. I still, to this day, have a shitload of gold that is totally useless as the auction house in Diablo 3 has been closed for years (and I don't play the game anymore).
---
Quick question. On my 25 rogue which main hand should i use with the meteor shard dagger. Stinging Viper which is 15.5 dps and 2.8 speed or wingblade which is 15.7 dps and 2.2 speed i think. It also has like 5 agility.

Oh no, it's retarded, feel so bad for him.  Must suck having to live with that condition.

That‚Äôs awesome. The one day this week I choose to not login...

And you say *that*, however my experience has been very different. Not everyone that litters when there's nobody around to see it is going to litter when there's a crowd of people around. It's like that. It's not online vs. offline per se, it's 'will I be held accountable for my actions' vs. 'will I not?'

If someone you generally think of as a nice person gets drunk and is suddenly an asshole, you can bet that person is a dickhead in an anonymous environment too. The booze shuts up the part of your mind that cares about these things.
---
I want to see the face of the warrior in your group :D
---
&gt; Just learn your class and stop ninjaing gear from people.
---
Taking a near bis item isn't ninjaing.  And if you think it is, find a group that agrees.  Seems you can't do that which supports my point.
---
Blizzard's top notch CS is half the reason I enjoy this game so much.  =)
---
Further questions: is it the efficient way to level or the lazy way?

Lmao, such a dumbass. You can keep saying it has nothing to do but you are absolutely wrong. If people want a challenge like you, then why not run 3 or 4? Oh ya, cause that wouldn't be fast. But sure, totally not about rushing.

I actually play at a pretty unfortunate time for raiding on my server, I am usually able to play most times during weekdays except 5-8pm PSTusually, and weekends are usually on a case by case basis but usually I can't play then. So that either completely leaves out or puts a big hole in every guild's raiding time, and while I am interested in casual raiding eventually, it's not my highest priority in phase 1.

You can pretty easily tank in arms up to the lv. 60 dungeons - although they may require a more cohesive group/more gear for the war.
---
Pre lv. 57-ish (?) there really shouldn't be an issue. Unless the tanks' an idiot ofc
---
Even Enhancement Shamans can tank dungeons..
---
Holy shit that's Ravenguard haha
---
Should we tell him they are literally the same team?
---
This happened to me and didn't have a way to report the player. I asked barrens chat (mistakenly) and got roasted lol.
---
But WoW is life.
---
There's also an addon called azeroth auto pilot that will instantly accept quests. I have it installed but only enable it when I know I'm going to be fighting to start an escort quest or one like Hendel.  
---
Funny thing though, I had a similar start to my quest...someone else ran up and beat me to it. I helped them kill him and then asked if they'd stick around to help me. They linked the green ring quest reward and said "reward is trash" then hearthed out....Great for me, thanks mate...  
---
Ended up soloing it by pulling him over to the guards at the nearby tower.
---
Good bait.
---
Everyone else is being a dick, but nice job. Don't have the time it would take to farm or buy these now says, but I would have killed for the ooze/hyacinth back in the day.  Well-done my man or woman.
---
people tried to warn you, but noooo you just wouldn‚Äôt listen. ‚Äúreddit polls aren‚Äôt accurate because i took a stats class and know everything!‚Äù well would ya look at that, the polls that showed your server would have a terrible faction ratio ended up being right, surprise surprise. 
---
you have 2 choices, re roll now or re roll later
---
This is making beyond crazy. WTF is it with classic WoW that 15 year old game terms are suddenly different?
---
Cleave - a CONE attack in front of you. Damags enemies only in front of you. Cleaves always emanate from the caster with that caster at the cone point.
---
AOE - An AREA OF EFFECT that damages all or up to X number of enemies in an circular area, can be emanate from you or cast in an area.
---
The difference is meaningful because if someone says the boss does a cleave melee can still attack from behind, but if the boss does an AoE you gtfo.
---
I'm leveling my druid. I'm tanking/healing in dungeons as necessary and using cat for questing. Is there any reason to use cloth armor? The leather armor that's dropping for me has comparable stats but also gets me extra armor.
---
I assume at max level there might be BIS cloth armor for Resto, but I'm wondering if there's some other benefits to cloth.
---
I have no idea. We used to just call it AoE.
---
Oh... You delicate flower. 
---
There is gonna be a blood bath before that gong gets rung. 
---
Also that's really it on stuff like that really. Everything else releasing in the phases is just raid related. The AQ event was the only real once in a life time thing
---
Ok, point taken, Hunter
---
I despise people who use ignore

Chromie has sent us back in time.

Battle shout generates 55 threat per ally in range, split among everything that has you on their threat table. 5 man group with no pets that's 275 threat. That's more than sunder. It's also usable in defensive stance, has no cd, and costs half as much rage as thunder clap. If you aren't using it for the debuff there's no reason to use it over battle shout. And battle shout just gets better if there are pets in the group.
---
Granted, if the dps are all single targeting mobs then they're idiots that deserve to die anyway but there's not really a better spell for AoE threat. There's a reason Nef phase 1 is tanked by just spamming battle shout.
---
What's the server brah
---
Thanks :) Yeah not sure what that other dudes problem is.
---
how is that bait lol have you ever played on a pserv? the vast majority of players are backpedaling morons
---
*life tapping intensifies*
---
You definitely sound like a good mage, I wasn't trying to all mages were bad, I'm just getting frustrated with the bad ones because I seem to run into them a lot. There are definitely dickheads in every class though
---
Not sure if you are pointing out why \\#nochanges isn't a good policy or just stating your opinion of no changes.
---
Are GMs this bad now?? Really though??
---
Omg I did something very similar, except I was blowing the horn waiting for something to happen, then turning around and watching someone killing a lion. The final (3rd) try there was a random hunter running by and I blow the horn and watch as this lion randomly spawns right on him and start mauling him. I realized what the deal was and quickly asked for invite (which was thankfully accepted) and helped down him. We both laughed but damn I felt like an idiot.

r/imgnomeandthisisdeep
---
I am resubbing. 
---
I am enjoying it. But around level 15 I met a player and we quest together all the time. We make it a point that when we don't play together that we are still within 1 level range of each other. So, because of that it has been a lot of fun since I'm constantly playing with a friend.
---
Only 35 right now but I'm taking my time and enjoying the experience.
---
Your hit table might look something like this against a level 63 boss:
---
24% miss
---
40% glance
---
16% crit
---
20% hit
---
If you were to gain 25% crit from other gear or buffs, your new table would be this:
---
36% crit
---
0% hit
---
You actually only get 20% more crit because you didn't have enough hit. Crit can only replace hit I the table, it can't replace miss chance or glance.
---
Continuing the above example, if you now also gained 10% hit, your table would look like this:
---
14% miss
---
41% crit
---
5% hit
---
The 10% hit decreased your miss chance, making room for the 5% crit you were losing out on from before, and there's 5% normal hit left over.
---
These are extreme examples, but if you're using world buffs, it's easy to accidentally crit cap yourself once you start getting t1 and t2 gear if you neglect hit. Luckily most of the best gear has hit anyway.
---
I made the exact same mistake, I was so confused
---
Don't hate the player, hate the game. 
---
Keep hustling my dude.
---
So much run time would have been saved if I skimmed the quest text regularly.
---
Not everyone wants to min max their leveling. Maybe he just has fun going against the grain and not doing the same boring AOE spec that everyone else is doing? Maybe she‚Äôs on a PVP server and likes to single target focus? You don‚Äôt have to do why everyone else do
---
And the hustle to get to the point of ringing the gong is gonna be insane. Guild leaders, and streamers are gonna be the only ones hitting that thing.
---
Nope, drain life ticks and corruption ticks can trigger Nightfall. But yes being full health while channeling drain life sucks.

100% agree with this post, mages are absolute cancer 90% of the timeRIP to the good mages out there
---
lool i found some tauren warrior doing the same thing a few weeks ago i had to tell him to blow the horn.. he thought i stole his mob
---
Yes
---
he = I
---
Was this a roof originally exploited in vanilla WoW though? Like, is it an exploit or a feature?
---
Remember servers are larger now. So medium is more like high back in the day. There‚Äôs still people there. :)
---
Kill the turtles on the east side of the big lake under undercity. Good for money too
---
Yea..really got no sympathy for horde getting ganked. Your faction does this all day. And this is hardly revenge considering you killed all their mobs for them in the process.
---
I have seen literally one post about it. That post came with proof. Are you one of the mafia guys? Is that why you get defensive when someone mentions it?
---
Search for the scarab lord quest chain on youtube and prepare to abandon all hope of ringing that gong
---
Hard part is finding a keyboard you can put up with and a trackpad that works.  Or a small enough wireless mouse to use on the laptop next to the trackpad.
---
After that, it's a matter of finding an i5+, 8gb+ RAM and some sort of 970 or better video card.
---
(I have a cheap $600 laptop, but I dislike the keyboard.  It's still good enough to do fishing with when I'm watching a movie.)
---
It's all relative. I ran zf at 46-50with a 2hander and it was no problem. Did ST at 51 with a shield, also no problem. It just depends on group comp and the healer
---
Your steroid use is hurting your sense of humor

On retail you can‚Äôt even see your guild friends in the world cause of sharding...

And to know someone who's cleared to Krixix in BWL
---
The Whirlwind ability is considered an ability that uses weapon hits on all targets with an area around the warrior.
---
So to answer your question, whirlwind can and will proc on hit effects that have a melee attack as a requirement on any victim hit by it.
---
Additionally, if one whirlwinds during a fall, they may stall out and levitate midair, but will always prevent or recalculate fall damage from the position cast.
---
Do it
---
Yeah couldn't agree more. I played Vanilla to Wlk, got hacked somehow, and thought I was done with WoW. I played a bunch of MMOs - Rift, Wildstar, and ESO in the mean time, along with some major breaks. Classic got me curious, so for the low cost of a sub, I got back on. I was able to find my full roster of 80's (I'm a bit of an altaholic) stripped of anything of value. But I can't figure out how to play them anymore. I spent a few hours trying to unfuck my old main, get started on some quests, and get skills sorted. But it's not the same game at all, and the lore is confusing as hell to straighten out. 
---
So I have a difficult choice to make, not that anyone else cares. Try to figure out 4xpacs and get my old crew up to speed. Go full classic, playing a game that I know very well, but this time with a class I didn't play in vanilla (like doing the warlock stuff). Or say goodbye again and back to ESO, which imho is a better game but lacks some of the community and charm of WoW.
---
:O
---
Im not even disagreeing with your point. Just saying you come off as an asshole when you talk down to people who are just asking questions.
---
Thats a plot i want in on ;)
---
Why? I ran MC several times as 0/31/20 and have been topping meters. You still want to be frost because only rag is a challenge but fire is perfectly fine in pugs that go in to kill 4-8 bosses. 
---
BWL is where enemies actually have a ton of fire resistance, saying you can't run MC as fire is the same as saying people can't run ZG as frost because it isn't optimal.
---
Subreddit Meta memes. Loving this sub
---
That was hot af
---
And yet, in the thousands of times I did it, I was never even so much as given a warning. I am fairly certain they did not give a fuck back then and, if it was a truly game breaking exploit, they would just patch it instead of banning as long as no third party cheating or tampering of game data was used.
---
Why what?
---
Based on the fact they actually went looking for his appeal and saw it was removed, yes
---
What‚Äôs the cheat?
---
Drop tailoring for what?
---
Then your basically a bad player.  Gratz on that.
---
Any feral Druids or pallies in there dpsing? :P
---

After over a month of editing, I can finally say that this project is complete (with two more episodes hopefully coming soon). This video is more a TV show episode than a regular gaming video. It aims to parody sitcoms, noir films, John Wick, and Quentin Tarantino while also being it's own unique and entertaining piece.
---
My goal is to get to 10k views. It sounds crazy and honestly I'm probably aiming too high but what really matters is that you all enjoy it so I'm happy with any number as long as it's appreciated!
---
As with all art, sometimes it is portrayed differently than the author intended, so let me know what you thought of the video! As it's a parody in some ways, you may notice an excessive use of laugh tracks, even in very serious moments. This is all intentional, as I'm making fun of the use of laugh tracks in the first place. Let me know if I went overboard with that, or anything else! Were the John Wick references clear? Was the intro too long? Did you like the obnoxious, eardrum breaking screeching of the intro? (again, some parts are intentionally bad, but I hope I didn't go overboard since it still is intended as a high quality and hopefully enjoyable video)
---
This video took a ton of effort to make so I really hope you guys appreciate it!
---
I'd love any feedback from you guys in the comments cause all feedback helps me improve in future videos.

Exactly, but don‚Äôt tell him that...or the fact that it‚Äôs closer to 300 in most cases, nor that it‚Äôs impossible at sm levels to get anywhere near 200 healing power.
---
In Vanilla, most hybrids are utility classes. Not the best healer, not the best damage, not the best tank
---
However they contribute massive boons for the group in the form of healing, cc, and totem buffs.
---
Same thing for pallies, same thing for druids, none of those classes are amazing at 1 given thing, but rather bolster and empower the group as a whole.
---
Think of Support as it's own niche class/spec so you have tanks, healers, dps, and support.
---
The post was long, but it read like a charm. Didn't noticed the length until I was done.
---
I guess I would be more curious as to why you stopped playing wow the first time after only 5 times. I have played wow on and off since 2009. I love classic, I got a 39lvl hunter and enough gold for my mount. Can't wait to play. I love it.  But maybe its not for you.
---
This collection doesn't have my server.
---
seriously.. it's been aoe for decades.
---
But spellcleave has been a wow term denoting magic heavy groups for 10 or more years in arena, so co opting the word for classic to mean magic heavy dungeon groups isn't that far to go.
---
It'd be like when you turn the BBQ on for the first time in a while and all the food left on the grate turns to carbon... odorless

If they  sit in that spot winterspring guards don't agro onto them, terrain exploit.
---
I don't think the issue is that it has the highest concentration, rather than it being the most played class. There are just so many mages that you're more likely to run in to one that's an asshole compared to any other class. But, I think the asshat concentration is the same across all classes.

Yeah, that was a pretty bad choice. No offense intended dude.
---
Just report them, they‚Äôre taking this fairly seriously lately.
---
First I gotta say I love your minimap and chat layout, and how everything is focused on the bottom. What are you using to replace the character plates? What addon are you using for your bars? Is the bar on the bottom titanui? is that questy tracker on the right side? And finally what did you do to make your XP bar look so sleek? I love the general theme and color scheme you've set up. Sorry to just bombard you with nonstop questions haha I am just infatuated, curious as to what your PROPER setup looks like as well.
---
When you start doing dungeons more than questing probably.
---
I was just on Pagle and it was very crowded in RedRidge, took me awhile to do a quest, even grouped up
---
‚ÄúYou can play however you want‚Äù
---
This is such bs lmao. Please upload the screenshot where he asks you guys to use "ice storms and ice stuns".
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs allowed, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs cheating.
---
It's not false. You need mind flay rank that you learn at 42 to make it outdmg your wand. Pre 42 you deal same dmg with disc/holy/spirit tap build but have way more sustain.
---
you hate us cause you aint us
---
I think it's useless for PvE until Phase 5 and still inferior to Frost until you start getting pieces from Naxx. Fire needs a lot of crit to work right, and there is this one boss in AQ40 that can only be killed with Frost Damage.   
---
Most BWL mobs have high fire resistance, so no point in prefer fire over Frost.
---
Excuse me, for my apology I'll PM message you with my PIN number for the ATM machine.
---
Cue dory
---
Same, if you see my Gnome Rogue Nerds shuffling around, give me a /wave. I'm on a lookout for anyone with the name Jocks, I want to be their rival. Has someone named their character as such idk but one day it'll happen, hopefully.
---
I went out of the way to get my Zulfarak mallet just so I can make my own full clear quest group.
---
They mention requiring Epic mounts for the next raid. Does anyone happen to know any other requirements to be in APES out of morbid curiosity? Clearly they have race/class requirements as they are all basically gnomes and dwarves.
---
How do things like ship masts count out of curiosity?  It seems to mostly be listed as a concern around places with guards.
---
Goddamnit why did you have to share it with the rest of  us
---
I‚Äôve met tanks that dumb

---
If it makes you feel better, it's awful for a veteran Mage as well. You have new Mages fucking up and blaming everyone else because they watched a streamer do it and think they are emulating it perfectly, so obviously everyone else must be the problem. 
---
The amount of Mages I have had in my group casting Blizzard on a 2-mob pack, or nova'ing a bigger pack and then standing in melee range and dying is astounding. If it's just me and one other Mage, and our tank is a shield warrior with a Hunter or Druid DPS, they still want to try and Spellcleave and Preblizz pulls, then die. 
---
I'm not someone who hates spellcleaves either. They are great when they work and they aren't bad for the community or the problem at all. The community and players themselves are what is bad. The new people, be they from retail, streams or even just old ornery-ass veteran players that haven't played since Vanilla and think they have any skill are all part of the problem. 
---
People refuse to adapt and learn, and always look for someone else to blame. The way retail WoW is designed, it generally doesn't matter, and while Classic doesn't require any more skill, it does require patience and learning for slower, more drawn out mechanics, and modern MMO players don't work well with that type of system. Hence all the clashes and wipes.
---
What i love is how they described what they did and why it was wrong and apologized. Shows that they got it. That's a good recovery customer service wise.
---
not even frost armor... nice.
---
Is it not better to give your enemies hope, only to crush it?
---
Ya, like half the reason I rolled warrior again, and an orc one on top of that.... Is my intense hatred of rogues. Rogues the only class I go after no matter what. I'm basically a pacifist except for fucking rogues.
---
Why the scepter and not the axe from rot? you get the axe spec 5% crit and it is slower speed so it's better.
---
Only one cow. So sad.
---
And is richpleb his actual account or an alt he made
---
&gt; The DPS would have to be patient enough to allow the tank to build threat
---
And we were. I was there. I was one of the DPS. I play a tank on my main.
---
That alone make it worth it.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito

I saw this while using Quartz, do you have it installed?
---
In vanilla it was possible to get up to the ghostlands area by swimming up the east coast from the hinterlands and climbing the hill.
---
There was nothing there. Just a big flat area with a default ground texture.
---
happened a few times now with different people, They need to patch it for sure.

I always take the offhand because even at 51 im still using https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/

In fact most of the BiS items from 40 onward are usually 1h swords or daggers, no reason not to get the offhand. The staff is nice because you'll sell it way earlier though

#showtooltip was not a valid vanilla macro string.

It was a policy as far back as 2005. Your anecdotal experience doesn‚Äôt dictate the entirety.

I guess maybe in these extreme situations it's a problem. But personally I haven't noticed it at all while out leveling

I saw this coming especially after the braindead 10 man sm zerg fest most people did to boost into their 40's. Magetards are officially a thing now. Even during normal runs I see mages that cant even poly and use blizzard on every pull even if its only 1 or 2 mobs. Tanks that just pull everything and wipe groups. Its so hard to find decent pugs for farming pre bis.
---
brb rerolling from Whitemane. They say it's only 53% horde but it feels like a damn lie.
---
Dude, don't feel bad. I know exactly what quest you're talking about and even as a 14 year veteran of the game I completely forgot that you needed to use the horn there. I did the exact same thing you did, sat there killing lions waiting for it to spawn before deciding to complain about it in General and have everyone laugh at me.
---
The sad thing is I have a vivid memory of doing the same thing when playing Vanilla for the first time. I didn't learn.
---
&gt; 0 reward or purpose
---
Gtfo
---
Ive watched like 6 priest videos today and you are semi correct. the extra 25 percent shadow damage you get makes it better then other specs. weaving and shadow for are better, for quicker dps.
---
Got me pretty good last night trying to sell a Warden Staff to some poor guy that simply could not find me. I was wracking my brain so hard as to why this guy couldn't find the Ironforge AH bridge... then after 5-10 min of us whispering back and forth he finally invites me and appears a few feet away. Smh...
---
Why use a stupid, inaccurate term when a term already exists for this exact thing and has existed for 20 years?
---
well try to look it up on google

Thank you and the other 10 people who down voted me for not reading my full post. I was just stating facts and clearly stated he can play however he wants, i just don't want misinformation to spread, which you are contributing to.
---
&gt; Maybe she‚Äôs on a PVP server and likes to single target focus?
---
Once again frost is still better for that.
---
Not helping is fine. When an undead warlock with 5% hp fears me, and a "friendly" mage polymorphs him and laughs at me, what do you do?
---
SM got nerfed
---
Scepter proc dmg is instant, 230 dmg over 30 seconds isn‚Äôt toogreat plus scepter is a bit slower too
---
No, I'm not stating nobody should play it, I'm stating that meme specs are bad. I don't care what people raid with, play however you want.
---
I just hate when people come on reddit and lie about meme specs being good. Anyone saying "But x can be viable if you have max consumbables and have perfect rotations and a super specific build"
---
Like if you just want to have fun and don't care about optimization, there is *literally* nothing to talk about, you just play whatever you want and it doesn't matter since you'll still clear all the content.
---
tldr- its about the misinformation and justifying, not trying to dictate how people play.
---
there are still good people working at blizzard? i am shocked.

since i suck at maths where is the 50% mark

---
When WoW first came out, we didn‚Äôt have wowhead, classicdb or endless number of youtube giudes on the game and had to figure out things ourselves. Nowdays, you can easily search things on internet when you are stuck with a quest or don‚Äôt know where to go to progress further. Theres nothing to worry about. Install, subscribe and enjoy the game and.. 
---
Say goodbye to real life responsbilities..
---
As far as I know the only think you have to buy is a one month sub to give it a try (if I'm wrong someone correct me on this). Which means it's pretty low risk to try it.
---
My bad was thinking it was slower for some reason. I have the staff from quest reward and it is slower and higher avg dmg than scepter. dont know how much scepter procs though to see if it's worth switching or not.
---
You can aoe every dungeon. There‚Äôs no reason to rp walk and cc mobs unless your tank sucks.
---
But was he top dps for those 2 mobs?
---
I await your reply.

Sorry, I misread and thought you were referring to only being able to play that way on a part-time job.
---
Honestly I feel like that isn't really hardcore. I mean that is just what you do in your free time. Watching tv or looking at your phone probably takes the same amount of time for non-gamers.
---
Small note: She doesn't offer the quest. It's offered in the cathedral in SW who sends you to look for her. Which is fucking impossible to find if you're like me, leading you to resort to wowhead.
---
Shocking mages aoe a pack of multiple mobs.
---
More on the the news at 7 oclock.
---
How dare these players use aoe abilitys.
---
Fuck those guys
---
that's the only way to get anything done with customer service these days, post it on social media and hope it kicks up enough of stink for upper management to fire someone for it.
---
I dunno man I feel like you are just making this up or seriously have put no effort into doing anything in the game and you would unsub regardless.
---
Shameless guy rolling twice for it!
---
This entire sub is an armchair developer
---
As big as Reddit is, this subreddit only has 382,000 readers.  That's a small fraction of the WoW subscriber base.  Don't *overestimate* how big the subreddit is.
---
That being said, if you're customer support, you can resolve one person's issue and make one person happy; or you can invest the same amount of time in resolving an issue popular on the subreddit and possibly make up to 382,000 people happy.  It's a no brainer for them to correctly address every ticket that gets big here, just because the payoff for doing so is so disproportionate to the payoff on other tickets.
---
Isn't that just a tactical strategy
---
I'm not at all. I'm just saying it's not a deterrent, it's the opposite.
---
Where should I level as a lvl 26 rogue?
---
Thank you
---
Are you actually trying to say that the aoe method of dungeon running isn't viable?
---
Or are you just being a reactionary trying to make yourself feel superior to other people?
---
Plenty of servers with just 1 layer. Go play there!
---
Exactly
---
Yes but Meteor is a dagger and the others aren't. It's not that simple. 
---
If he's dagger spec should use Meteor.
---
I always felt their cs was pretty good.  With that said, they responded to a ticket of mine with "respond with blah blah" email.  I responded.  Their reply was "your ticket has been marked resolved".  /shrug
---
I definitely did
---
Thank you! This is an awesome graphic!
---
Unless they were thinking over a year in advance, I wouldn't even say they tuned the game to encourage those microtransactions, as the horse, bag, and bank systems are exactly the same as they were when ESO was a purely subscription based game. And I wouldn't really consider going back to town less often to empty bags p2w. When I think btw I think of those East Asian MMOs where you can buy basically everything.
---
See that's precisely what ppl thought, and out goes the mmo of the game.
---
Feed pet buff also goes away once the pet enters combat, so you can deter them from Improving happiness
---
Fat man rage, been there, done that, not going back.
---
Tbh you probably deserved it
---
You will piss off a healer, but that‚Äôs blizzards fault for itemizing the damage so well. 
---
It works well for you too...
---
i love warlocks but i feel like they are trash in a spell cleave group 
---
hellfire sort of sucks because you either end up with a warlock tanking or there is a mage to hold agro then the lock is ok but could easily be replaced with another mage 
---
i feel like there is no spell cleave group without at least 1 mage
---
also bad dual wield tanks are a pain i had real trouble trying to keep dual wield tanks alive in brd , not to mention if you cleave from sm to brd you enter brd at 51ish but are still in sm gear.
---
the best warriors i saw in a spell cleave group just grouped the mobs then the 2 mage took turns and aoe'ed them down while the war just picked up random mobs and brought them back to the group (not face tanking 10+ mobs)
---
it was a relief once tanks got into lbrs and got some gear and actually a few went propper prot specs, you are just dps till then not a whole lot easier to heal than a rogue.
---
Herbalism really makes that much moola eh?
---
You're a clothie caster guy. Do cloth caster guy stuff.
---
are you sure he was 44?
---
A warning for a free month. Worth it.
---
Sometimes I do this because the mob is dying and blizzard is a channeled spell that does DoT and my clearcasting procced so it was free mana
---
am undead rogue. can confirm.
---
yeah cuz there are never any posts here about "hey this happened to me today"? wtf
---
Goteem
---
Lbrs only? I had groups consistantly hit 120k in BRD torch runs. 59-60 took me less than 4 hours.
---
It does, you just can't see it until another buff is applied from any source.
---
It should be hot most of the time if geography is considered on Azeroth. Right north of stv in the southern hemisphere.
---
Yeah i wish they'd add facebook games to every game, that'd be so dandy.
---
Girns......its a darn obligation when a healer is playing whack a mole unless our blood is boiling so high that we fit in the why you did not heal me wheel of spite and hate.
---
Well i certainly am not amused with having some tryhards spaming arcane explosion before the tank gets in range for trash. Especially since they go oom while all mobs still have 70%. It was fun the first 3 times seeing a mage ragequitting after this action but it happens way to often to still be fun.
---
Its like a grp of people gathered around q table.the mage suddenly gets up decides to shit on it and run out of the room screaming some nonsense.
---
Do let me know how that goes!
---
I laughed even harder on the /wave spam by the poor horde
---
I didn't replace til I got a spell damage robe after finishing the elite hinterland troll quests
---
You have said lfg ZF.
---
They invited you to a ZF group.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
Im sorry but holy shit this is beyond the joke of
---
 complaining ppl like you are more annoying than these spellcleave tryhards.
---
See you say its clear but then go on to have to add a bunch of different conditions.
---
bro I can't say goodbye to real life responsibilities, I just got engaged lmao  
---
But yeah you're right on that, things have come a lot further now and easily made available to progress. I'll honestly just have to give it a go. Thanks for heads up too lol
---
Assuming your Horde at least.
---
Wrong, dummy
---
Gear that has better stats. You‚Äôre low level, it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Also down rank. You‚Äôre using rank 4, that‚Äôs your emergency heal if down to under half. Top off with rank 2 to save mana. Over healing is wasted mana
---
Also on Myzrael, I kinda regret not doing RP myself. But I think I'll just roll an alt at some point to test the waters. I assume you're horde, I'm a 36 hunter, feel free to message me sometime Monday/Tuesdat, I should be on (Littlehoof)
---
It's called [Spy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic). You can see it on the right hand side in the video. It monitors your combat log and alerts you every time an enemy player is spotted. It also has special alerts if it detects a stealthed enemy near you.
---
You can mark players Kill on Sight, and will play a different alert if they come near you.
---
It depends on the class. But not all fights in mc need Fire res. And I think some times the need for fire res can be somewhat over stated.
---
This is an old comment, but could you tell me which NPCs, if you remember? I'd be interested in reading about this in-game.
---
Have you tried not being a little bitch?
---
This is a major yikes. I hope you get better.
---
you'd think. but apparently it counts as a bannable exploit since guards being incapable of pathing to the rooftops isn't intended. but apparently they also ban people for just camping guardless areas now, since it's 'disruptive gameplay,' so I guess they're just taking a more firm anti-griefing policy for the launch of classic wow.
---
***R***...*"Hmm should have started this further over"*...***E***...*"eh I'll just put more spacing between the words"*...***A***...*"fuck... well I aint drawing all that again"*
---
damn are you that dumb? 
---
if a rogue is combat specd (ie PVE specd) vs a pvp specd (arms) he might lose more, but a proper pvp specd rogue that knows how to play the game will win 8/10 vs warriors

Only a fat man would hop on the defensive like that
---
I‚Äôm on a medium pop server and I‚Äôve never ran with guildies. I usually find groups fairly quickly and often times for multiple runs and goes.
---
You don't need any fire resist, just some greater fire protection potions for ragnaros
---
if the population is fine why do people keep posting self reassuring posts about heartseekers population to this sub?
---
I'm not that impressed by it
---
I'm mining/herbalism still, planning to drop one for tailor, then drop tailor for engi
---
I've probably made more by pulling arcane crystals than I have from herbs, if we're being honest
---
Shit man, i feel them, i subbed with my brother Hoping it would tide me over till iceborne launches on pc, but in the end, a hoonter must hoont, i still play a bit on the weekends, but there's only enough time for one game on weekdays.
---
There's nothing better than small streamers raging
---
do do do DO DO DO
---
A fellow fire mage! There's dozens of us!
---
^ This guys fires
---
Over on Yojamba there's been a consistent 1-3 lvl ?? allies ganking at the great lifts or entrance to shimmering flats every time I come on.
---
Amazingly I managed to survive last night without getting caught once but /1 was blowing up about em as usual.
---
Back in my day, we called it AOE grinding! And that's how we liked it!
---
Circle? I am pretty sure the shape you are looking for is ‚Äúcondom‚Äù.
---
I got ganked on skeram in stonetalon by an equal level rogue (I am also a warrior). It was at that point, I realized I am complete trash. He did not camp me at least, I think he realized how bad I am. I don't even think I got a rend off on him. I ran away and he gunned me down on cold blood. Good times!
---
Sounds like horde in s nut shell :p
---
Greater fire prot potion is all you need from my understanding.
---
Fire mage! It's like seeing a unicorn.
---
Just got my Swift white steed today
---
Feels fuckin' good man
---
Took that thing on a ride and swiftly collected a black lotus later that day
---
Livin' the dream!
---
Uh why would you do that.
---
Thank fucking god for the lists people compiled of where the popular streamers are playing, I've managed to completely avoid their bullshit for the most part. Nixxiom is on my server but he's not a super high impact streamer.
---
What 1.12 talent changes?
---
Dont worry its not missleading. It shows exactly what youve said
---
Spellcleave refers to running with 3 mages, a priest to bubble, and a lock to pull with eye..  I keep seeing all these posts whining about aoe and calling it spellcleave
---
If you're not sure just buy a month to start. If after a month you're still really enjoying it consider changing your sub to a 3 or 6 month sub instead. Don't pay more upfront if you're not sure you're going to stick with it.
---
If you roll on this as a rogue you cant complain at all when you lose dal rend to a hunter
---
she hates anything that has to deal with technology too much lol she recently got a new phone and let me tell ya, she might be only 25 but damn she's like 80 when it comes to learning new stuff that
---
Didn‚Äôt buy at launch, but I just bought a month of subscription and will be playing with some friends.
---
You wanna share? Because that sounds amazing
---
Yes it does matter to me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking. It has 4 different bonuses for the set with a final one of +10 attack power. I can‚Äôt just randomly replace gear cause one stat shows it‚Äôs higher. That‚Äôs why I was asking.
---
Maybe they should have rolled on Carebear servers rather than teaching all the "plebs" the wrong way to play the game. Grinding SM GY for 10 levels is NOT the most efficient way to level up, despite what those streamers have caused people to believe.
---
I laughed so hard I was crying because I've seen this exact thing so many times hahahah!
---
It's totally accurate when it refers to groups running 3x mage, priest, lock.
---
I
---
No it's actually insane for fury 2h dps warrior
---
Ask if the healer wants it first. There's a lot of other healer gear there, they might not.
---
Think how you'd feel if a really good dagger went to a hunter who will only use it for the +agi. They shouldn't roll without asking first, nor should you in this case.
---
You could also announce at the start of the run you intend to roll on it. I don't think that'd be an issue.
---
Aoe doesn't mean caster centric though, it's a less specific term than "spellcleave" in this case.
---
trust me from the arguing I did in the original threads about this, the common consensus is this has always been blizz's policy and you are imagining things. and even tho that's bullshit and goes against the spirit of #nochanges, everyone's got a justice boner for banning griefers so I guess this is just how it is now.
---
What‚Äôs the minimum level you‚Äôd consider taking a DPS into SM Cath? I‚Äôm a 35 mage and would love to run it, but don‚Äôt want to ask if I‚Äôm too low in my guild.
---
No, because this exploit takes place in Gadgetzan, a neutral city for the Alliance and Horde. The Gadgetzan Bruiser NPCs keep the peace, anyone who tries to PvP in the city will be aggro'd by the guards. So no, it's not a tactical strategy, it's an exploit and is extremely rude to use against other players
---
Yeah skinning is good profit. I have really high skinning myself but I spend the gold everytime I get 10 or 20g. Then again I'm trying to rush smoking heart KC the mountain. Even if I cant use it yet. 
---
I just enjoy having high professions I guess. And the 20% movespeed isnt really a worry to me right yet.
---
It's great for 2h fury
---
This was fast
---
Nope, it's the loyalty. Happiness only affects how much damage your pet does and whether it's gaining or losing loyalty. As long as you don't let it's loyalty drop further when it's already down to 1 then it won't run away.
---
Whereas i'm still a poor man
---
I think i just fail at goldmaking, 'twas the case in retail as well.
---
There's your issue, that's the primary streamer server.
---
Sheesh these comments suck. Wish I could help, but I have no idea. Gl broski!
---
What‚Äôs the add on called that gives you the portraits like that? I remember using it years and years ago, and I totally forgot about it until now.
---
Same, it seemed the better economical choice
---
Whatever you do, don't blow the horn while someone else is fighting him. I learned that the hard way.
---
No problem buddy, but literally people are so stuck on their own opinions they can‚Äôt answer shit for anybody
---
My friends unsubbed because someone lied and spammed their names in SM for being a ninja.  Just because they got outrolled.
---
herbs suck on my realm
---
as does leather
---
im a skinner/herb &gt;.&gt;
---
i should have picked tailoring XD
---
Naw it's a great weapon. Especially as fury 2h and the proc hits really hard. Since it's faster you get more pics too, crusader is 100% a great enchant for this weapon.
---
Game elements that are exclusive / elitist / unbalanced are core tenets of the Classic philosophy versus modern WoW. This sort of thing is what makes the differences meaningful.
---
It's not like ZF zombie farming was an unknown thing that mages have just discovered in Classic. There is a case to be made for tuning patches in the future, but that is a Classic+ path that we aren't walking down anytime soon.
---
Same. I still love eso though.
---
This is a 5head post, I approve. 
---
Step 1. Be a hunter
---
Step 2. Post this advice
---
Step 3. Win at pvp because people are using this advice.
---
Wow youre a pedantic asshole.
---
The graph isn't saying that, it's just saying that is the total amount of exp for each level/range.
---
Was just in the group with one of these tanks in an BRD arena farm group. Prot pally, Holy Pally, Hunter (me), Mage, and a Rogue. The tank just kept telling the mage to "flex your mage muscles man, you've only done X amount of damage more than me". The guy would do these large pulls with no CC and wonder why the healer was oom every single pull and why they mobs weren't dying fast enough etc. then just rage quit after the first arena clear. This damn mage aoe farm meta is a legitimate cancer to the game imo.
---
This deserves way more upvotes. Amazing job.
---
Yea this is true 3-4 people I‚Äôve blocked are high level mages. .. for me it‚Äôs always them trying to ninja a few gold from the whole group or yea.... giving one stack of water to your healer... 
---
Just got hassled by a mage In my guild for asking to buy a invis recipe that was going for 5.5g In AH. He offered me 2.5 and I asked for 3? 
---
He then said how he lets titan flask recipes drop for guild and that he‚Äôs not going to make me any now... lmao note added.
---
It's not a waste at all lol. Only better wrap on that lvl range is destiny with crusader
---
They‚Äôve said multiple times that it‚Äôll be removed  by/with phase 2, when world bosses drop. I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôre sticking with that plan.
---
Wait he drops scarlet pants? I though that was a cath drop
---
I had this issue (my friends are all a few lvls higher than me) even when giving me time to build threat so I respecced fury and am putting my last 20 points into prot actually works well 2 1h swap to a shield if I need it, crit all the time so pulling decent dps and building more rage than I can spend now I generally don't have problems unless it's more than 3 mobs because I just can't split my dps that far and still hold agro
---
We cleared Mc with a level 57 green geared rogue he used some fire protection potions and survived every fight. Classic raiding until aq is a joke
---
I dont think 180 pounds at 6ft is consider fat but that's okay
---
If you're not a tank you don't need FR. Having it makes you less likely to die, so it's not a bad idea to wear what you can.
---
I think ive been in a SM run with you haha
---
We‚Äôve got 30+ people farming them all day every day. Leather is about 5g/ea
---
Warriors were the most played class in Vanilla and Druids the lowest. This post is completely made up.
---
Wait til you're in Naxx. Then you can watch your ignite damage soar
---
I was really looking forward to classic.  I was there at the original release and have a lot of fond memories of the game.  I played a lock all through vanilla and tbc.  I'm obviously older now and have less play time, so when considering a class this go round, I chose a war because I assumed finding groups to hop on and tank for would be much easier than a pure dps class.
---
Early runs were easy enough to find a group within 30 mins of logging on (DM, Stocks, BFD, Gnomer).  Starting with SM, I noticed a considerable decline in group availability for running a dungeon normally.  Spellcleave was the most common group I saw when looking to run something post 35.  
---
Short of abandoning the guild I've been in over the span of numerous games and advertising blindly for "guild with most people active", I'm not sure what I can do to easily find groups running the dungeons normally.  The majority of runs I see are pushing for spellcleave.
---
I wasn't looking for a pity party, but stating my observations and what ultimately put out my fire for classic.
---
Yes but as fury rocking a 2h the only better wrap near that lvl is destiny
---
Grats bro.
---
I guess my friends and guild mates must be godly tanks, or I'm just better at maintaining a proper balance of damage and control than you assume. :)
---
Clank clank brrrrt
---
I main Alliance but, still, that's some fine revenge work there, friend!
---
meteor is offhand.
---
he can't be dagger spec he's only 25.
---
go stinging viper
---
As a hunter I drop a hunters mark, or immediately flare if I hear a stealth sound effect, I've found rogues really hate when you flare though
---
In the chain i am responding to you never mention your class or skills you just flame some druid for using swipe.
---
You appear to be the one who cant read and apparently has a serious anger problem
---
Wait, so I get what you're saying about the attack power, but how does the base weapon damage work? Does that mean like 2 weapons that have the same amount of dmg or dps but one is slower than the other, the slower one will deal more dmg? Not sure if I'm just getting all unnecessarily confused. 
---
I appreciate you giving some insight on this!
---
It‚Äôs misleading if I‚Äôm stupid! Grab your pitchforks boys!
---
That's what makes Blizz great sometimes.
---
"We fucked up, here's a $14.99 coupon for WoW game time on us."
---
It's going to be entirely doable these days even for casual players
---
I got mine at 41. All (?) it took was 8 hours of grinding whelps and skinning them
---
non-sarcastic Pro Tip: you can start taming him while he's in a freezing trap! :D
---
I'd love to let you know when I last got some free game time but with Blizzard's "new" design of their account page it no longer lets you see that stuff.
---
Totally agree with your last statement. I generally ignore and even have helped the other faction, mostly because there's no point other than being a douche when we are both trying to quest and get to 60. Now if I am on the receiving end of getting ganked then you better believe I am going try to kill you every time I see you, which usually ends up starting a war in the zone.
---
If you ran out of quests you didn‚Äôt kill enough mobs while questing. Classic leveling is mostly about getting Xu from mob kills. So if you race through your quests and try to only kill mobs you need for a quest you will get behind. However if you kill every single mob that isn‚Äôt grey or red then you will keep a nice pace with the quests and IMO find the zones more enjoyable because you can stay in the zone a lot longer.
---
I use a Dell Xps 15 for streaming, full graphics wow classic, and dual screening for YouTube and whatever else. It's a  fantastic machine if you're looking for a new laptop.
---
I work 6 days a week and play when I can
---
I drink when I play and I guess plastic beats glass
---
Keep the comments coming , I'll read them while I keep drinking my beer, cheers!
---
They chose to play on a pvp server, so go nuts.
---
No you don't, you just need to literally pick up every single item, if your bags are full stop what you're doing and go vendor trash.
---
Eventually. The benefit of having unlimited time I suppose.
---
Are the any like community guesses?
---
There‚Äôs more druids than I thought there would be, honestly shaman are harder to come by for me -a feral Druid
---
Unrealistic to go to a dungeon for upgrades, get one... then have 4 kids want to make money off your upgrade... grow up and John a mature guild that knows how to play the game right
---
You can see her bottom booty cheek meat
---
I'd recommend all of Duskwood + dungeon leveling, then Arathi and finally you know where....S T V
---
The time you enjoy wasting isn‚Äôt wasted time.
---
Why is faster attack speed bad for warriors?
---
My friend and I did a lot of this week one.
---
It literally does. That's the fucking point.
---
Hi, /u/IAmDadTV

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9uqj5/when_blizzard_wants_their_money/). 
---
Us Trolls just wanna hang out, man.
---
Don't even need to do all that. Had my mount @40 with mining at 220 and bs at 197. It's not that hard just need to know what to ah and what to vendor and always have bag space to vendor all your trash. Good thing about leveling Bs as you go once you move up to the next bars you can now ah all the lower level stuff.
---
Nihilium are overrated, kungen wiped the group five times in UBRS
---
Do the same divided by average quest XP
---
You should read the quest text anyway because it expands on the world, it‚Äôs characters, etc.
---
How did she ride it without a body?!
---
So? Old AV is irrelevant, as the AV getting added to classic will be way faster.
---
If you do more advanced development, get familiar with /fstack and /etrace.
---
Maybe put the beer down and go to sleep. I think that would benefit you greatly right now
---
I read it 3 times and didn't see a bit of anger. Perhaps you're projecting?
---
This whole thing sounds like the intro to Skyrim.
---
+10 attack power is not as powerful as it sounds. Maybe difficult to replace right away, but 10 agility is better than 10 AP. 
---
What are the other set bonuses? Congrats on filling out the set, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done that with any set of gear in Vanilla or Classic. 
---
As someone else said, I‚Äôd hold onto one or two pieces that seem individually better until you get 3-4 to break up the set. Maybe you need a better understanding of your stat weights as well (how you much you value agility compared to strength or attack power). Knowing where you are wasting stats or can improve stats on your existing gear will help replacing it.
---
Alliance players run around and gank shitloads also. :3
---
&gt; Since there are really few druids
---
There is also a reason for this
---
I use KillCounter. I got it through the twitch client, although I'm sure it's on the Curse site aswell.
---
It tracks Total player kills, individual player kills by name, and the last time you killed them. It also tracks monster kills in a separate tab.
---
Lmao another problem not solved by layering
---
Nobody likes Sylvanas.
---
I didnt bother respecing until I had most of my Pre raid BiS. Pets are still a good damage source in dungeons, but as for raids, they die easily so theres no point being BM anymore at that point.
---
Thanks!
---
Same. I have learned a lot and there will randomly be really funny quest text that is very entertaining.
---
Serious question...why? I mean with MC being a joke, wouldn't you be replacing that with a tier 1 chest relatively soon anyways?
---
Better question is why can i swap bags without emptying it fully or request the next stop mid flight but there's no gd key ring
---
So this raids don‚Äôt need 40ppl anymore ?
---
Yah I had some free game time messages, I think only a week. It was around then; 2012 or 2013. Some new expansion. I hadn‚Äôt played since college, late 2000s. Hahaha 
---
Classic has been the best thing ever though. They can have my money for this shit.
---
I have played the game on and off since closed beta and had to google this noob bullshit term.
---
One of those 1 person ganks?
---
2 pieces: +10 Armor.
---
3 pieces: +5 Arcane Resistance.
---
4 pieces: Increased Daggers +1.
---
5 pieces: +10 Attack Power.
---
Lol +5 to neckbeard
---
Neat.
---
Honestly yes, I 100% believe that the retail story isn't bad. They've managed to maintain a pretty interesting story throughout 15 years of existence. It may not be what you like but if you'd rather just circle jerk about "but le retail bad" then go ahead my man. There are a lot of things wrong with BFA and I am by no means a fan but I believe the story is pretty decent. 
---
I'd love to hear why exactly you think retail is bad, enlighten me.
---
Raiding is completely different to 5 man low level dungeon where everyone seems to be in a rush. I've tanked through to BRD as a bear and it is not unusual to lose agro but taunt and high threat abilities brings threat back quickly. Of course your taunt can miss but you would need consecutive misses to be in real trouble and if that's the case you are really unlucky or too low for the run. 
---
Playing devil's advocate, are you positive your tanking is beyond reproach? It's better to look for the learning experience rather than assign blame.
---
Yay you had a tantrum like a child. now you can be an adult and replace the carpet and paint the wall because your home is disgusting.
---
The real secret is to not respec.  30 fire/21 arcane images are beast.  There is only a couple boss fights in MC that are immune to fire and you can just frost bolt instead.  That and trash.
---
Did they ask you to Rez them with a SS? I have been asked that twice
---
I see condescending tools are the norm on this sub, feel free to provide some legitimate criticism if you have the capacity to.
---
Wait, you can group with people who are the opposite faction?
---
What a fucking mess.  You are disgusting trailer trash that owns it.   Maybe spend the one day you are off cleaning your shit hole.

I‚Äôm debating between Druid and Rogue. Pvp is important to me. I‚Äôm maining a hunter. I love world pvp and bgs. Duels are great too. Would I be screwing myself doing Druid since both hunter and Druid don‚Äôt scale that well? What are your thoughts on Druid or rogue.
---
Intentionally ruining the gameplay of another player in an mmorpg has been a justifiable and actionable since their inception. FFXI literally had a virtual prison your character could login to during your suspension.
---
People actually want tips to give out water in dungeons?
---
I'm a 33 mage, classic is my first time ever playing WoW, and I'd never ask/expect payment for waters. I make 80-100 before entering instance and ask if anyone needs any before we start because it's the right thing to do.
---
You have to use wall jumping to get to those places.
---
I was more hearing the first 'bah da la dum!'
---
This same thing happened to me! Had to go get another horn. Do people not know how mob tagging works? That is extremely rude. I /ignored the person.
---
Because people meme all the time about HS being dead.
---
Call out the dps on it when it happens.
---
Oh look, it‚Äôs the latest Saturday morning cartoon villain of WoW this week...

Clever use of game mechanics. Any real player can get on any roof that people are crying about getting camped on. Even if guards could get them on the roof they would kill guards and players. In vanilla I spent hours at a time camping the rooftops in Booty Bay killing everything that moved. If they cry about pvp they probably shouldn't play a game with pvp.
---
Triprunner Dunagrees.
---
Those would be blue, and you can't kill members of the same faction. So it's pointless banter.
---
The pvp is in a neutral town. Not to say that you can‚Äôt pvp there, just that it has the risk of you dying to the guards. There‚Äôs no risk on rooftops so it‚Äôs considered an exploit. Why it wasn‚Äôt fixed is just cause #nochanges
---
Not even going to bother reading the rest off of the first statement.  You are proof that ignorance is bliss, you do you, enjoy the bottom of the barrel.
---
You should make a YouTube video or something.
---
Totally agree .. the whole aoe grinding meta that is going on has everyone thinking they can  just run in and blast everything down... I swear sometimes I feel like some dds don‚Äôt even have single target spells on their bars
---
how is getting your epic mount meaningless
---
Some Hunter is going to go full John Wick after this happens to them
---
Wow thanks, I would really appreciate that!
---
You‚Äôre passing around some incorrect information. Top end and slow speed is really all that matters to ret. they need slow big hits for SoC.
---
1st one didn't get banned because they didn't do it long enough. Nobody is making the claim that killing them once will get you a ban.
---
Good for the ally there! I‚Äôm horde and I‚Äôm getting ganked by groups left and right.
---
You clearly play on a pve server.  Enjoy your sad version of Vanilla
---
This is why we play games
---
I'll cover you in .. something. If you want to smol boi ;)
---
I feel like this is just temporary.  Current wow is all about strangers speedrunning instances with timers and then never seeing each other again. Blame is thrown around without any care because there's no consequence. 
---
Classic is a game where setting up groups takes longer, wiping hurts more, and people remember if you're a dick.  I see this spellcleave as and attempt to treat classic like retail and I suspect it won't work.
---
I'm only level 20 so I can't speak too much to it.
---
Dont make your friends do the same mistake that you did.
---
Even then the gator axe is just flat out better since axe spec blows mace spec outta the water, atleast imo.
---
It's one thing to agree with your group that everyone should roll need beforehand. 
---
Literally tricking the group into greeding so you can ninja is is kick / ignore / personal blacklist territory.
---
You can obviously do what you want, you're not gonna get arrested, but I can't see that shit being beneficial to your survival in a social game.
---
You know survival of the fittest refers to the fittest species, which includes cooperation as a significant element. That's how humans have lasted this long.
---
Good luck dickhead!
---
If you're alliance: For
---
Horde: Against
---
I like that idea of sets for specs, or even benefitting hybrid builds. And more cool procs or abilities on items that have Cooldowns.
---
Lbrs is faster. 59 to 60 took me 2.5 hours, but this was on 2nd September before demo fix. We were running as fast as lockout allowed. 55 was around 140k xp and it slowly went down from there.
---
Killing guards is fine, as long as they can access you.
---
Twitch
---
If you go to the main page of this sub, click on the three dots in the upper right, then click on Change User Flair.
---
That's my bad, I didn't mean to imply \*you\* downvoted me. And yeah, pushing meters is basically what DPS do. Especially if, like I was saying, you get crap DPS if mobs don't live for certain periods of time, so it makes it feel like you're barely contributing the whole run. Warlock DoTs take time to give big deeps, rogues can only slice n dice and auto attack with some Sinister Strikes thrown in.
---
Although to be fair, the dungeon I was doing, we were a bit over leveled for it, so things probably won't die as quick if you're lower, but it's rare for the full group to be "reasonably geared/leveled" for the content. Usually at least one person is carrying half the team.
---
tuk has even less customization
---
"check out my custom car, i totally put down the sun visors in my 2005 camry!"
---
Lol its trash for 2h fury. I swear, the lack of knowledge on this subreddit never fails to amaze me.
---
I‚Äôll blast your land
---
Was in Dreamstate during that. DS has no idea NOPE was going to be there. I think APES (NOPE) is the better guild by a smidge, but this could play out differently in the future
---
But using any sort of staff at that high a level is really gimping yourself imo, yes they have wild dmg ranges, but losing out on the talents is rarely worth it. Maybe for sword spec, but not at all for axe or polearm.
---
Balance man.
---
Because damage of skill is based on weapon average-max damage.  
---
A weapon with 100-100 dmg with attack speed of 1.0 has 100 dps, a skill doing 125% of weapon damage will do 125 dmg.  
---
A weapon with 200-200 dmg with attack speed of 2.0 still has 100 dps, a skill doing 125% of weapon damage will do 250dmg.  
---
on a pure "auto attack" scenario, both weapons are the same. When you add in skills, it matters because for 10 rage 1 button will make 125dmg, or 250 dmg
---
I mean, all horde males have crippling scoliosis, so. . .
---
MOAR DOTS. HANDLE IT.
---
You can always roll an alt, leave the war w/ rested xp (it takes 10 days to get the full 1.5 levels of it) and then try a dungeon or 2. If it's still not to your liking, wait X amount of time.
---
Or you can just let it become a bank alt, whack 2 profs on it nfi what and leave it at that.
---
Everything in Classic is canon. Its just the beginning of WoW.
---
Does chapter 1 of a book stop being canon because youre on chapter 8?
---
It‚Äôs not mis-leading. It‚Äôs just not very useful in application or consideration.
---
Didnt realise that was the only dungeon in the game
---
hi every1 im new!!!!!!! \*holds up wand\* my name is gnomechompski but u can call me t3h gnomerator oF fr0st!!!!!!!! lol‚Ä¶as u can see im very bigbrain!!!! thats why i came here, 2 meet bigbrain spellcleave ppl like me \^\_\^‚Ä¶ im 13 years old (im mature 4 my age tho!!) i like 2 run SM w/ 3 of my friend gnome mages (im spellcleave if u dont like it deal w/it) its our favorite dungeon strat!!! bcuz its SOOOO EPIC!!!! they're bigbrain 2 of course but i want 2 meet more progamers ppl =) like they say the more the merrier!!!! lol‚Ä¶neways i hope 2 make alot of friends to run spellcleave with so give me lots of commentses!!!!  
---
BLIZZAARDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;--- me bein progamer again \^\_\^ hehe‚Ä¶toodles!!!!!  
---
love and frost novas,  
---
t3h gnomerator oF fr0st!!!!!!!!
---
There is only 1 rank of riding skill, but each race has their own. The mount itself is 900g.
---
First off get to 29 ASAP. Go to SM &amp; ask for groups in general for GY. Going to towns &amp; asking for groups isn‚Äôt what we‚Äôre doing. Ppl r LFG 4 SM right at the dungeon entrance. 
---
If u can‚Äôt get to 29 - go to Sun Rock Retreat &amp; only do the top tier quests. Check all class quests. Get FPs that you don‚Äôt have. Also prepare for STV PvP. Boooom. SM time.
---
My enchanting tool tip keeps telling me that the Smoking Heart of the Mountain is a brown kodo
---
And the fucking music! Best part of the instance imo
---
I mean best aoe farm is not blizzard, its shatter coc and arcane explosion. Fire aoe is pretty close to that as well.
---
The quests in Thousand Needles should take you to around lvl 32. I think you‚Äôve skipped out on something, maybe pushed higher lvls a little to early. 
---
Scarlet Monastery is the easiest answer. You could live in the dungeon from 30-42. But that‚Äôs not fun for everyone, or likely anyone. But you might have to grind out a lvl or two there until you feel comfortable moving on to STV. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to push STV, or do SM. Grinding is your next option. If you‚Äôre wandering around doing a random quest in one area and traveling to do one more...you‚Äôd be better off staying in one spot and grinding certain mobs.
---
1 level before you respec ele if you don't wanna take 20s+ per mob. Gratz!
---
Wow you are so lucky dood! Most game Developers just have their Anti-Cheat bots just on auto-run. NO human interaction.  Then nobody believes you and you shunned hard but there was a light at the end of this tunnel. As you enter the World of Warcraft once more. Make sure to keep the Rooftop "clean" for your opposing faction as a sign of gratitude. May the guards look the other way and your missles ring true! \\m/
---
Mana Tide.
---
Lol I'm horde and I say goodjob on using your kit to destroy everyone mentally. Most dangerous person to 1v1 just needs to know there class, the enemies class, and timing. You mastered that shit in all these fights. F for that warrior tho, homie was struggling with that keyboard turn
---
I am thinking which oceanic server should I be on....now you've made my choice! See you soon :)
---
So quick question then if your warning got overturned. Is going on top of the arena an issue, or going up there explicitly to avoid the guards the issue
---
perfect solution: keep interactions to a minimum (outside of work) 
---
problem solved
---
unless you enjoy socialising...luckily, i never have. 
---
People just don't make sense to me.
---
Nice a free month.
---
Haha, made my day bro....
---
I had no idea what I was in for on my paladin when I got here, but luckily a level 40ish warrior saved the day, arriving heroically on his horse on top of the hill as the first wave ran towards me. He let me get first hit on everything and used his shouts to get threat so I didn‚Äôt take any damage. Very lucky to have this kind stranger help me!
---
Most OP class atm. Until we get later into the game.
---
No need to apologize.  It's been a while since I've been prot, though I was prot through all of vanilla.  It's been 15 years, but your input is valid and welcome.  Thanks!
---
Layering has caused so much bullshit.
---
I'm surprised Activision let's then give out free game time like that.
---
Thanks, always just used atlasloot before
---
classic raids super ez man.
---
Yeah but no kick? My man's 3.5 second entangling rooted in their face lol
---
potentially, i did spend about 10-15g on runecloth bags
---
i have probably purchased a few too many talents.
---
i have 2 gathering profs tho - skin/herb but they're not selling well at all.
---
i may be spending my money on things...i just don't know what. i don't buy pots, i don't buy gear off the ah (apart from bags). I may be in denial and blocking out things though.
---
*shrug*
---
They were only 23 people. Still 17 empty player slots. Find yourself a friendly but decent guild and I‚Äôm sure they will squeeze in whatever class and spec you want to play!
---
&gt; run BRD/BRS 25 times for one piece of loot 
---
hah, thats optimistic
---
It's like The Muppet Show time-traveled into the aughts.
---
A good warrior regularly swaps between 1h/shield and their 2h. If there are no casters in the pack or you have DPS to reliably CC, you rarely need to have your shield out. 
---
A good warrior can hold threat and top the DPS charts tanking a majority of a dungeon with a 2H. 
---
Sword and board tanking only works well if you‚Äôre fighting 1-2 active targets at a time or your DPS respects threat and kill orders, which will never happen.
---
What?
---
Wasn‚Äôt sure if they were going the runescape route and rewriting
---
I play the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô classes not because I don‚Äôt know/want to learn how to play other classes but because I don‚Äôt have much time and want to have  fun with higher level content as I can level a tiny bit faster
---
I just want to commend you for calling out people using the word retard.
---
I just started a lock, I promise to Life Tap responsibly
---
\#showtooltip Polymorph
---
/cast \[target=mouseover\] Polymorph
---
/run SetRaidTarget("mouseover", 5);
---
The question is how do you lose aggro on one target, there almost no group dmg on Herod and did everyone in the group stand in the boss whirlwind or something.
---
It's going up there to avoid the guards, going up there by itself is fine.
---
i pulled around 60g at level 40. i think i could've made it to 100 if i took skinning instead of alchemy
---
A lot of these so called obstacles in WoW are just poor design, It was a new game of a new genre and hadn't ironed some things out yet. 
---
Tediousness is not a good feature of a game, yet WoW has numerous examples of it. Fixing some of these to provide a better experience to the end user isn't going to make the game worse. 
---
For example.. adding a filter to the LFG channel that filters out people +/- 5 levels of you to provide you with a more readable and usable channel wouldn't break the game. 
---
Nor would adding key rings to save you from having to buy new bank space just to store keys. 
---
What about having yourself auto-dismount when you cast a spell on a mount? Omg, that would so make the game worse. 
---
Think about what you're saying before you start spewing shit. God you people annoy me.
---
It's not a bad choice anyway - gets to HIGH during peak times but I've yet to need to queue to log in.
---
If you gank someone while they're fishing, you're actually a horrible person and I hope you step on a Lego.
---
"I like to fart in the tub."
---
How can you tell how many layers a server has?
---
Why
---
Idk for sure but I would assume Deviate Delight has the smallest population. However I find tons of people to play with in the 1-50 level range. Not a huge amount of 60s yet but I think that‚Äôs a good thing.
---
I used to stealth into Orgrimmar and use this on one of the elites near the main area, one of the generals  I think?
---
Used to see how many horde I could kill before they either found me and killed me or the time ran out on the cap.
---
Irrelevant. If you sit on any roof where guards can't path to you and use it to camp gank players (especially lower level players), you can receive warnings and bans for it. It's against the rules, always has been.
---
A big one used to be getting on one of the roofs in Darkshire and ganking every lowbie that walked into range while the guards bugged into the wall below you unable to touch you.
---
No. Get the sword of omen and vanquisher sword.
---
i've seen people selling sader for next to nothing compared to the money i'm seeing get passed around.  folks know how to make gold right now and it's a great buyers market if you've got it.
---
this guy rps
---
I think I stole it from you, won it with an 87 and the next best was an 86.
---
There's only one RP server.... and it's layered to hell and back.
---
Also the quest was changed to "Win the battle" partly *because* nobody was trying to win the old ones.
---
You have no right to be posting so frequently and with so much talent. I love you, please keep it up.
---
It's still a part of the game. it's really not fair to call a part of the game that people participate in an extreme situation.
---
If anything I think you're being a little extreme here.
---
Yep - happened to me too.  Actually, it looked like it had been a chain reaction.  There were 2 other people there waiting to tag when I blew the horn. So after I lost the first one, I told the other guys that I would drop the quest and head back to get it again.  When I got back we grouped and got it.  
---
Essentially though, they had failed the quest due to others tagging and rather than run back and get it again, they were just waiting there to tag someone else‚Äôs.
---
Says person with zero evidence to back this up...
---
Because she's Daisy Duke.
---
PVP in Gadgetzan was part of what made the true vanilla wow experience epic.
---
Why is it bad for warrior? Is it not bad for other classes
---
the armor is the main benefit. In bear form, it translates to like 1200 extra armor. Druid tanks primarily care about damage mitigation. This is the best druid tank weapon for that reason, so it's worth the gold for anyone taking bear tanking seriously. The defense stat doesn't have a huge effect because druids will never reach the defense cap anyways so they can never be immune to crushing blows like warriors can. It will increase chance of attacks missing you.
---
Lets no joke here... every member of the opposite faction is on a KoS list....
---
It drops in both.
---
It's me, I'm the mage
---
You don't really have enough spell damage to make a difference while leveling, the coefficent on Blizzard is low.
---
Addon or no Addon it‚Äôs not going to get me on the boat faster. When I leave to go for boat is when I‚Äôm done doing what I‚Äôm doing not best time to catch a boat.
---
Unfortunately every slot is completely full
---
Phase 2 will be hell for leveling.  The honor system is being added, but not the battlegrounds.
---
Okay finally some good news from Blizzard now that Classic is released! Truly going back to oldschool ways in more ways than one?
---
It's considered an exploit as it wasn't intended, it's up to blizz to decide if its an exploit or clever use of game mechanics - not you.
---
It was against the rules in vanilla as well, I remember people getting temp banned for doing it excessively even after warnings (thinking surely it wouldn't be a big deal). I know of people that were teleported away and told very explicity do it again and you're donerino because they were shutting down a whole area.
---
Blizz has never been okay with this and the majority of people knew it was against the rules.
---
I know how im farming devilsaurs now
---
I think its 17%
---
I feel like before classic came out, there was a lot of discussion on forums and Reddit about "best class". I remember seeing mage and warrior come up a lot in those discussions.
---
I bet a lot of people latched onto that advice, and just aren't good at the class. They ignore that player skill and learning the class will determine those numbers.
---
Also I totally forgot to address the AoE threat question on if I struggle or not. Yes and no? It's a little bit a nuanced topic imo. 
---
I use to be very critical with my AoE threat and would get bummed if anything attacked a caster etc... However I see warriors and druids pretty much struggle as much as I do, AoE threat is just hard sometimes.
---
So shamans can struggle with larger groups especially going beyond like 5 mobs since CL can only hit 3 at a time. However shamans have an advantage too which is stoneclaw totem. Usually this can generate enough threat for a sufficient round up of mobs for AoE dps, or better yet grab mobs for enough time for you to get a better hold on mobs you couldn't tag with CL. I highly recommend imp stoneclaw for these reasons.
---
Bye
---
Bless your heart, thank you for this good deed
---
Bliz said they would be removing items associated with the bug as well. I'm not sure if they're following though as those accounts aren't back but it's not just a 30 day ban.
---
2 weapons both have 50 dps. One weapon is slower and the other is faster. 
---
The faster weapon will have to have a lower damage range for it to have the same dps as a harder hitting weapon. Slow and high damage, fast and low damage. 
---
Melee classes have a lot of abilities that scale off of weapon damage since there isn't nearly as much weapon speed normalization as in the later xpacs. So basically the slower the weapon the better the DPS a class can put out
---
Kinda want Sylvanas to step on me tbh
---
Oh no, someone made a mistake - how incredibly human of them. Maybe they should hire you, as obviously you in all your perfect glory would never make a single mistake ever; and then at least if you did we could drag you through the coals and publicly humiliate you for it.
---
Nah, I'm going enhancement all the way
---
i tried to find the original video for this meme yesterday and i was very disappointed to find out that the cat was just inserted by someone on the internet lol.  i was hoping to find a video of this lady actually yelling at the cat lol
---
Playing on Arugal. Things aren't exactly cheap as chips but it's manageable and obtainable.
---
u fucked up, the double swords are bis for phase 1 fury rip
---
rawr
---
Well you‚Äôre lucky they had layering or you would‚Äôve gotten two quests done in a week by having 60,000 other people to compete with in your area, then you wouldn‚Äôt be doing a single fucking thing in the game. Go cry somewhere else.
---
Here we go
---
They only affect one group so they are not really worth it.
---
I highly doubt they have the same customer service guys as they did in vanilla.
---
Not one disbeliever in here? Really?
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't huh.
---
I did the same thing with a 15 boe sword..... gah
---
Back in the day, you wouldn't get logged out when you ran out of subscription, I wonder when they changed this. Seems kinda petty.
---
This is how all PvP servers will be. 99% of players will become nothing more than currency for the top 1% of players to farm 24/7. Enjoy phase 1 while you can
---
Even reputable websites have classic gold for as low as $0.20/g. Yes that is 20 cents per gold in USD. Not sure where they are selling it for so high but shit I could buy at 20 cents and resell to your friends for $1 per g.
---
Nice dress
---
I disagree. Those people were dumb enough in the first place.
---
Ye just giving you a hard time lol
---
Literally!
---
Always
---
This makes me feel good I‚Äôm lvl 38 and at 66gold. There is still hope.
---
Legit impressed how serious he was about the matter, gg wp blizz!
---
Not officially, but if you tag a mob someone one the other faction can still help you kill it.
---
Why would you need crusader pre 60? Waste of gold.
---
Including the cork platform proves one of two things: that they dont think good, or that they're willfully exaggerating to further their argument
---
Where was this confirmed?
---
Its a part of the game for a reason. Now that bro will be dropping flares and traps like its his full time job
---
It would be interesting to see how XP availability via quests change as levels go up as well.
---
cause that's mattering at all. people are blowing through these raids. Old rules don't matter for anything
---
I see a Hunter and his pet is low I‚Äôll charge and execute that hairy fucker. Then intercept the hunter and hamstring and bleed his ass and run away. Just fuck his day up lol.
---
Dude some of these people will always find something to bitch about. They're defective lol
---
That's pretty slow compared to elemental, tbh.
---
Halfway is 92
---
I started doing it at level 36 as a hunter and it was wonderful. I felt like I blinked twice and I‚Äôm now level 44.
---
Just know your shit and know how to not puss off your tank and healer, and you should be fine.
---
&gt;What are some good options? Leaning toward mage or warlock, possibly shadow priest
---
lol so all of the casters? 
---
&gt; probably herbalism and alchemy for caster types?
---
herb alchemy has absolutely nothing that favors casters, it's used by everyone. 
---
Mage is pretty busted in vanilla
---
Get corpsemaker from RFK, it's even better and will be eady for you to get at 35! Or just hold off till you can get Ravager
---
I've noticed that if you do this with Mobs, the damage shows as immune. Curious why they don't just do the same for NPCs and avoid all this.
---
Ayyy can i get a healthstone, a soul stone, and a port please?
---
Well warriors are bonding through their love for fighting. Druids are already bonded through Moonglade.
---
Nice story that didn't happen.
---
Blizzard uses Mend Pet   but nothing happened
---
Nice trash dump homie!
---
i'm no pro and i haven't gone past 25 but warlock and mage are both awesome choices. Mage is better for raids, but the mage gameplay never evolves past "frostbolt x infinity" whereas warlocks have a lot more in terms of dots and utility and other ways of damaging people. for casters people prefer tailoring and enchanting, but i recommend you take skinning instead of enchanting because disenchanting all your greens puts you in low money numbers for a while. Skinning on the other hand is free money. 
---
reasons i like warlock:
---
fun to solo, you get a free mount, dots feel powerful
---
reasons i like mage:
---
infinite food and water, portals sound nice \[didnt get that far\], some cool utility like aoe CC and polymorph
---
personally i've been on the fence back and forth. earlier this week i said i was maining mage, yesterday i had no clue, today i'm feeling like warlock. Who knows my dude. play what you enjoy or what sounds cooler; although locks aren't great dps right now, once the rest of the phases come out they become beast.
---
there's an official blizzard LFG channel you can join in the chat options
---
the play is to make you watch the pet killing as a sheep
---
I swear I‚Äôll be doing a quest solo no problem then someone invites me to their group and proceeds to fuck everything up and constantly do dumb shit and pull everything
---
Classic raiding is going to be jokes until a few naxx bosses imo.
---
5head statement right here boys xD daft fuck
---
The true halfway is about 42
---
Ravager Axe is slightly better just from raw damage range and DPS. The on-hit effect also makes up for the lack of any stats.
---
Truth hurts
---
It's free PR. Your post on reddit blew up, and they knew almost certainly you'd post this resolution here too ;) they handled it very well. But I'd wager the 1 month game time bonus extravaganza and the finding closed tickets to address is all just a perk of reddit outrage. You made CS look like idiots, now you make them look like retail questgivers showering you with rewards and kisses ;) it worked out for both sides!
---
We have abilities that do weapon damage but don't rely on the actual weapon swing
---
Uh...I'm sorry you didn't get your pic and all, but thanks for the laugh!
---
"Iceberg" is a fucking gnome, ain't he?
---
A+ faceplant, though.
---
You mean like, a guild calendar?
---
By itself, sure it doesn't add to the capacity. But by utilizing layers the devs have been able to up the server capacity for now since doubling the world means double the people without it feeling more crowded. They aren't taking the standard 3,500ish capacity and spreading it over 3 layers. They're upping it to over 10k capacity for now.
---
They've point blank said that the queues will massively go up in phase 2 if server pops don't balance out. How would queues rise exponentially with a static player count unless they're reducing capacity when layers go away? If layering going away means less capacity, the only logical answer is that layering means more capacity.
---
Why did you as a hunter take that? Pure cancer lmao.
---
10ap is equal to 10 strength on rogues. That said, agility is much better than strength for rogues.
---
I just imagine it spamming constantly to the limit the entire time in Tanaris.
---
Just the tip?..
---
This guide has been pretty good. I've followed 95% of it as a human warrior and have had fun doing it. There's a few errors in it (less than 10 so far).

Happened to me by accident, but a lot of these "spell cleave is making people toxic" posts confused the everliving *shit* out of me at first. On grob you rarely even see spellcleave groups compared to any other group. 
---
Its a happy accident :^)
---
In a straight up fight (not attacking when they already low), I'd rather fight a rogue solo than a warlock.
---
All I was trying to get at is you don't have to boycott the game cuz of it. You probably won't even notice it 99% of the time. I'm not saying it should be in the game at all. But it is you can't change that. But you can still have some fun.
---
A video might be worth 2 months gametime ;)
---
I mean it's pretty standard for a supervisor to do this stuff. The GMs are human and made a mistake when addressing a ticket rather than an automated report when someone is right-click reported for cheating. Anyone can submit an appeal and ask for a supervisor and it's specifically their job to correct these few cases out of the thousands they get a day and make it right for the player.
---
Enhancement PvP, I would put troll on the same level of orc stun res.
---
The 43% haste for spell casting and attack speed is absolutely busted. It allows you as full enhance to spam 1 second lesser healing waves (with spell batching is pretty much impossible to stop) along with zerkkng brining down chain lightning to 1.5 cast speed matching that of elementals. Something no other race for enhance can do: cast lightning spells effectively in combat and have a higher attack speed for that inital melee attack out of the cast animation.
---
only me and the tank could even use it, and the tank is a good friend and thought it'd be funny for me to take it, chill out
---
Because it's wrong. By definition, it's wrong and we should not perpetuate it.
---
What the heck ? 16 ppl no way
---
Right. You raise night elves as Dark Rangers during the darkshore missions
---
Many warriors abilities like Mortal strike determine their damage from weapon damage. Now for the most part fast weapons tend to have low max damage and slow weapons tend to have high max end damage. So if I have two axes with identical stats and dps but different speeds the slower axe will be the bigger DPS increase because it'll make Mortal Strike hit harder.
---
Oh yeah ally rogues always tryna gank the lifts but I didn't consider that. 1k needles. More RFD puggers.
---
Why lie? Win8 was never forced.
---
You're not allowed to play the game now?
---
You could become a majority stock holder and bring it up at the next board meeting.
---
Ok that's fine. Still pepega for using it tho.
---
Asshole man!
---
nice skill diversity, missing coc into ae spam... then getting carried by  rogue while double blocking... ok ... nice "revenge" :&lt;
---
I'm a tank until I can afford to go back to arms. And let me tell you people take dungeons for granted. I had one group believe that we could form an the first half and decided on a fourth DPS instead of a healer I instantly left group because I don't deal with that.  Dungeons don't offer a huge amount of XP. And the drops are nice enough you can get them in one or two runs. They don't need to be sped they just need to be safe the more you dye the more time you spend walking back between the last time getting loot.
---
This shit so much. Not a mage but i feel the pain from seeing this shit all throughout fucking wow on the classes i play.
---
They saw a youtube video/streamer/guide and assume i just do this i win. Even in shit like Mobas when people see someone playing a hero and stomping they assume oh if i just do the same thing i will be as good. Skill, Experience and knowledge are nothing i just win if i do this.
---
The orgrimmar bank never felt the same after that.
---
Saw this drop on my first and only Armory run awhile ago. I already had WW axe which I prefer on a PvP server. The shaman in the group was so extra thankful I knew I had made the right call. Its a nice axe bit not worth sweating over unless you really want it specifically.
---
I actually specced to have faster pet revive. Smart players will take out my pet. I'll usually freeze trap, revive pet, and continue. 
---
Didn't think that talent would come in handy for pvp but it does
---
Sucks you couldn't enjoy it. See ya.
---
I got this on my main in 2007. Great weapon.
---
not useful since the infographic does not take into account that at higher levels you get more exp from mobs and quests.
---
horde good boyz they dindu nuffin
---
there is no open world stuff going on in retail. the open world just serves as a hub to que up for dungeons. then you just get teleported to the dungeon.
---
if you do open world events with too many players blizzard will actually temp ban you for causing lag.
---
Eagle is all like:
---
"Pathetic"
---
Dude if you're this adept, then why did you even come to a discussion board just to shoot down discussion when you could easily just use wowhead item database with a level req filter instead?
---
This is exactly my thought. If this is an issue shouldn't the  devs fix this instead of warning/banning people?
---
Google "WoW census" and see for yourself.  There are multiple data-gathering addons and sites spanning 15 years and you can Archive.org the ones that are dead.  All of them put Druids and Hunters at the top.
---
absolutely this!!! OP, get to work!
---
Except, of course, *they don't*.
---
What happens instead is that they AE spawns and generate aggro they can't handle. When they do use Frostbolt, they tend to pull aggro. They don't handle runners. They don't manage CC well. They don't decurse.
---
All of those things are why people want Mages in their group - and when Mages at 60 can't do them, they're useless.
---
Orc wouldn't save you against this.
---
You gotta be lvl 58 to get the MC attunement quest. I spot a liar.
---
"So you don't have to resist the temptation to play Retail every time you wanna check your gametime? Naaaaah...." -Blizzard probably
---
level fishing... As a shaman I water walked around stv  from grom gol all the way down and  back up till the beach ends... You can make good money off floating wreckage and mith trunks plus stonescale eel.
---
Would love to see this.
---
To be fair, at my level I don't encounter most of the casual players. Because if you don't put in at least 4 hours a day, you won't have reached that level by now.
---
I understand. This is never-ending story. Like half of the warlocks can play efficiently and don't need heal too much. And like half of the healers know the mechanics of the warlocks. So there is little chance you'll get both the good guys in a group.
---
When you have a pack of 3 mobs it's better to hold threat on all 3 than just 1. Swipe costs only 50% more rage than Maul, but hits 200% the targets. It's a net-benefit on total aggro across the pack.
---
I spent a couple hours with a troll priest closer to launch when we were in Searing Gorge because we were way ahead of the pack and had no one around to help with the elite quests. We managed to do everything twice for each other and it was a super great time. Not all rogues are lowbie ganking assholes. :(
---
You're only level 39... just reroll...
---
Fake af, OP thinks we are retards
---
Ah i see, good to know. Cheers
---
Nice. I will have mine in a few days aswell. when i make my last Mooncloth.
---
Because its dumb computer guards responding to smart computer players understand the guards pathing limitations to grief other players in a nominally neutral zone. Does it really take that much brainpower to understand how this is undesirable?
---
Dude you‚Äôre so right fuck you opened my eyes all of you are so right. Fucking so stupid of me 4HEAD I should just be upgrading my gear. Damn that simple and totally not doing anything with my question of what to replace the specific set with I terms of same effectiveness.
---
Gnomer has Civinad robes, then Grimlok's tribal vestments from Uldaman.
---
It was an anti gold selling measure implemented during the burning crusade - the 1 hour wait on ah money that is - this delay helped blizzard to detect and intercept the sales. People would put a grey up for 100g or whatever and the gold seller would buy it. 
---
Anyway, there was no way blizzard was going to reopen a loop hole which would allow easier gold selling.
---
Ya I think it's shitty but I agree it doesn't seem like an exploit to me. I can understand people being banned for griefing if they over do it, but I'm not sold on using the roof being an exploit.
---
Stay logged on.
---
I'm so used to people saying 'nochanges' seriously to the most miniscule things that I just assumed you were one of them. Those people are so annoying lmao
---
Guess they'll have to do it the old fashion way: kill the quest givers.
---
The group you were in is not even considered spellcleave, hardly. Warriors can also tank just fine with a 2h (in the higher levels it‚Äôs actually better) and you are also blaming the entire fault upon Spellcleave groups when the essence of the problem was the warrior. 
---
Just leave the group and find a quest run? Your problem is fixed?
---
Fuck man you got me good one
---
Where are all of these \* cleave groups? Up to BRD on my priest I was only in 3 cleave groups. On my mage (lvl 36 atm) I've only been in one. I do occasionally see them in lfg or lookingforgroup, but they're like 1 in 8 or so lfm posts. Reddit makes it seem like that's all anyone plays. (Priest on Kirtonos and mage on Stalagg). They're honestly only a small minority, at least in my experience.
---
Meh most dungeons can be done in about 2 hours. Hell even raid days are in many guilds not longer than 3.
---
Ty
---
You were literally using the 10 AP stat as an argument for keeping the set instead of replacing pieces of it with increased stats LMFAO. Why are you being such a salty fuck
---
This is the reason i wont take any hunters in Group!!!
---
That‚Äôs funny I got one from strat in vanilla though. I was playing a rogue in a group with another rogue friend, the group let us roll for it since we were combat. Needless to say my friend wasn‚Äôt too happy after that
---
ive been running a fire and a bit of frost with a tiny smidge in arcane ..i enjoy playing fire with my rotation i can kill most mobs before they even reach me
---

Watch desperate housewives
---
The obvious key difference...in pve the mobs eventually get to you.
---
Vendor, obviously. Epic mount is needed.
---
We literally have been doing this on private server fresh launches for thr past 5 years. YES, we would 100% rather have that then layering.
---
The correct answer is go get the sword from bfd quest. Swords combat with reposte is by far the best easy to level and the best pve dungeon/raid dps until naxx where seal fate daggers can surpass combat swords or combat daggers. Thrash blade at lvl 45 brings you to 60 where you cam start farming ubrs for dal'rends. Unless you get felstriker or just really want to go combat daggers with some nice dagger drops.
---
Game time is more expensive.
---
No you absolutely do. The only damn reason they are even still pulling this kind of bullshit is because they can, and the only reason they can is because we let them by showing them we will support them no matter what bull-shittery they try and pull. What an ass-backwards way of thought.
---
I asked for specific prices or items too looks for not asking for a generic ass response with no thought to it. Fr yalltrying to make this something it‚Äôs not fuck outta here
---
This this this. As a tank, I will take not-fuckwits over high dps anyday. Also I have noticed rogues seem to have the better attitudes towards the game. I add people all the time who I want to continue to run dangerous with or who I want to end game with. Make friends with your tank and healers, they have so much sway in a group and will always take a person who can listen/work together over fuckwits.
---
Yeah it was dope!! Made my night
---

---
In my guild are at least 10-20 people who I assume stopped playing. (Weren't online in more than a week).
---
You might find the addon [Buffwatch Classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buffwatch-classic) useful. First you buff people, then you can lock in those buffs for each player. It'll show a timer for the buffs, and when they've expired.
---
Nah because I waited 2 weeks to start. See, I have common sense.
---
First, choose the right poison. Crippling on main, Mind-numbing on off-hand. You'd be surprised how many rogues skip this step. It almost guarantees an Iceblock right from the start.
---
I'd pick my place to initiate carefully. Ideally, if you can aggro a low level mob during the opening attack you're set against poly.
---
Speed is key. You can bet your left nut that Blink is the goto move if Cheap Shot is the opener. Try to cut the distanse between you and the mage as much as possible. I always attack from the front and almost instantly start running in the direction the mage is facing after Cheap Shot.
---
From here on, there are too many options to cover.
---
In any case, you want Blink and Iceblock on cooldown.
---
Logging off can switch your layer. But if you had a friend whos staying online you can invite them to make sure they are on your layer and when you come back they can invite you yo make sure your on the same 1 still
---
The game would essentially be unplayable the first few months of hype without layering on high pop servers. How some of you can't comprehend this is beyond me. A medium pop server now has more people in it than a full server had in Vanilla. Layering is needed and isn't a cop out.
---
I'm pretty sure I read a breakdown somewhere back in classic that showed ice spec even outperforms fire in single target, and that fire is objectively inferior. I'll try and find it.
---
Your probably just bad then
---
"It's just a measly a-little-over-a-third-of-a-million people, there's no way that'd be on their radar."

Soups on boys
---
If the DPS don't care for you, stop caring for the dps. And watch who will survive the longest.
---
Oh. I thought it went like this dum dum Du dum
---
These servers hold soooooo many more people than they did back then. That‚Äôs why the population needs to be regulated. That‚Äôs why the layers decrease as people quit and we move further into the game. Use your fucking brain. Do you know how hard it would be to do anything if the entire server population was actually visible to you right now?
---
The current prototypes for arms are far beyond just simply moving it. It sends back sense of touch as well.
---
Save your time. Don't really care one way or the other. I'm still putting out good DPS. I'm not concerned with squeezing out every digit I can.
---
This does qualify under harrassment/griefing depending how long they held you for. Per the ToS:
---
Disruption / Harassment: Engage in any conduct intended to disrupt or diminish the game experience for other players, or disrupt operation of Blizzard‚Äôs Platform in any way
---
So if they sheeped/MC'd you a couple times then killed you, they are fine. Continually doing it for an excessive amount of time with the intent and to the point you are unable to play the game is against ToS.
---
yeah... I am 25g from my mount... gimmie! lol
---
I love everything about this. Out of curiosity, have healers given any feedback on your damage taken compared to a warrior? Bit more? About the same? I'm a healer and I'd love to try a dungeon with a shaman tank
---
ask for help in the  general chan or afk until they get bored  .
---
sadly you can't do anything else \^\^
---
You are an idiot.
---
Back when i startede playing my english skills were lacking. I read month as mount. Leather as large. And mail as small. So when i came to thousand needless. To the salt area i believe it to be ice. And under a ice zone more ice right. Now that i how it Toke me 5 year to relize Tanaris was a not a ice Wasteland but a desert
---
It all depends on your situation. If your trying to do anything with large groups of people you are going to run the risk of layering interfering with that. And part of what made Vanilla so exciting were the spontaneous server wide things that would happen. When you layer people apart it ruins that experience that to me and a lot of people IS VERY MUCH a part of classic.
---
There is no spell cleave, only aoe
---
Hybrids being expected to only heal is a 2004 thinking. People nowadays knows that hybrids can be useful and can be brought to dungeons and raids without forcing them to heal.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Sure you can do that, but how's that different from just being a regular ninja? Man you can vendor nearly anything for gold, better just need on everything because thats the right thing to do right?
---
Dude one of the only current level 60s in my guild already told me he intends to make at least 3 level 35 alchemy alts for transmutes as well as he intends to pull up a warrior alt to 60 by the end of october. So yeah, I would say level 60s are more of the hardcore players.

---
Fair enough. Tho, realistically speaking all you care about is having a lot of int. Spellpower would be nice, but not necessary. Spirit helps with downtime, but you're gonna be drinking anyways and a bigger Mana pull helps more than some piddly  Regen you get between mobs. My mana pool is right around 4k and let's  me achieve the above, so as long as you get near the ballpark it'd be way more efficient.
---
***BEGONE THOT***
---
what quest/lvl is it? Hope I didn't do the same lol
---
Oh yea one more thing. Little bitch.
---
Hey, I have a senior game developer friend explain whats going on to me. It looks exactly like WoW started using Kubernetes microservices to spin up and spin down different portions of the game world to order to meet demand. That means they have little pockets of computers all around that can pump out CPU cycles for the Tanaris zone, then a different one for guild chats, then a different one for battle.net notifications, and another one for another service, and so on and so forth. 
---
This means that each resource only requires payment for what is demanded on the section of the realm that has work to do. They estimate Blizzard is saving about 30%-40% of the server costs by not having everything running full-steam all the time. It also means they create more Kubernetes "server pieces" whenever there is more unexpected demand, without having to buy and provision a new server blade for a new server. It also means you can buy smaller droplets of servers and use lower grade or even virtualized CPUs to again save on costs. You don't need to have a strong CPU (of which, commercial-only CPUs are selling for $5k each or more). You can piggy back on a bunch of cheap, shitty CPUs.
---
That being said, CPUs are ridiculously powerful at the datacenter level. Pentium 4 3.4 GHz CPUs were expensive in 2004, and could handle 43,000,000 half precision floating point operations per second (43 mflops @ 16 bits each number). Today, https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-7002-series which is expensive right now, can handle 943,000,000,000 double precision operations per second (943 glops @ 64 bits each number). This is basically the difference between a megabyte and a terabyte. Other resources have scaled as well. Blizzard should easily be able to run servers as they have in the past - always on and available, with multi-hundred player battles. They just have to expect to start paying $400k/month (estimated) for servers instead of $280k/month (also their estimation). It just seems like they really, honestly are *too cheap* to bring up that expense (this is my estimation). 
---
I really think Blizzard should remove layering.
---
This is misleading, scaling in retail is implemented in a way to give leveling flexibility but after a couple of expansions they‚Äôre capped. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember it exactly but it was like 1-60 is throughout all vanilla zones. Then it lumps together TBC, WotLK, and Cata, and MoP to 90? And then WoD (100) Legion (110), and BFA (120) are there own level scaling ranges. 
---
So if you were max level and you went to Vanilla mobs are max 60 still. You can steamroll if you want. 
---
But Blizzard also added in a new feature recently, an optional downscaling of your player so if you wanted to do content with your friend who was leveling for the first time you can downscale your character and do content with some reward and without having to make and keep up a new character.
---
thanks for the tips, you think cooking and first aid are good secondary professions then? First aid seemed so mandatory to me.
---
It would seem so. I'm glad my worries were unfounded. üôÉ
---
I only STV on off times. Too many players with too many egos.
---
I'm a new mage player, and I don't even know what dispell is. How do I do that?
---
Pretty much that but /cast and /equip
---
I hope one day it can send sight, hearing, and taste back to the brain like in SAO.
---
use google or youtube search there are literally dozens of gold making guides
---
There are way better weapons (axes) for 39lvl twink if you look my comments - I am chasing the BiS one. Also, there is another one for 35, that is better and cheaper.
---
People keep saying that spellcleave is the problem with leveling right now but i honestly think people are just really stupid. Idk if its just my server or what but every dungeon I do there are maybe 2 smart people and 3 not smart people.
---
Ive just been chalking it up to people never playing WoW before or not playing WoW in over a decade but the amount of dumbassity i have to deal with to do any dungeon at any time of the day is crazy.
---
People breaking level 40 not knowing basic mechanics of their class, not knowing that the red text on an item means that they cant use it, not knowing that methods they saw a streamer do dont apply to normal gameplay, etc. It's crazy
---
It isn't intended to be able to avoid the guards while killing people without punishment in an area designated to be protected by the guards. It is an exploit, it has always been one.
---
If they were spec‚Äôd properly they would have an easier time holding threat is my point.
---
If the difference is being a ninja for ninjaing 2g, or being a ninja for ninjaing 350g, then yeah sure, I'll give you that, np. But it's still ninjaing, and assholey nonetheless. I honestly dont understand how being a ninja stops being a bad thing after a certain set amount of gold involved but if that's what makes you sleep at night, be it.
---
Instant spells are very inefficient. I believe a Cone of cold even on ST is a better option. Fireblast should only really be used for finishing something off.
---
Build groups with bear tank, locks and rogues.  
---
"Mage LFG inv" - fuck off
---
That's a good theory you have about cooperation being part of survival of the fittest.  But it's false when it comes to WoW.  
---
If you know how to play, have gear and show up to raid you will have no problem getting into top tier guilds.  You could literally screw over 2 whole guilds in the process.  
---
Take a guess how I know that.
---
That is what I use.
---
Couldn't screenshot and crop...?

and then you can get banned by a random

This is grand news, considering we all pondered whether or not we may or may not like this turn of events, with current events reflecting that the consensus of our peers is that we indeed did.

Sometimes you don't need a tank in 4 mages spellcleave. Heck I even tanked with stoneclaw totems on my 5 ele shaman multibox back in late TBC.

hamstring kiting has been debunked since day 1. mob attack range is too high

the game version is based on 1.12, it's using the 1.12 alterac valley

So I'm glad we agree on that?
---
They only did it because they saw your reddit post.

Because the correct term is AoE and has been since launch day of World of Warcraft.

Horde have plenty of zones already though, I do agree probably needs a little more balancing but horde have it considerably better than alliance for the most part on the existing classic map
---
Part of the game is making sure that the opposing faction is weaker than yours. This is all fair play here. Bet he throws down a flair Everytime he goes to skin one from now on.
---
That's what I like to see!üëå
---
I‚Äôd rather use /join LookingForGroup . Lots of people there and use as the name suggests.
---
On my server Razorgore-EU, world is used way more than the official channels. Also there's rarely any trolling.
---
You could run Strat. Undead Part until you reach your 1k Gold or drop the Mount
---
The mana breaks tho. As a priest healer I'd rather have a group that can keep going, then a group that needs to drink every pull.
---
It forces them to attack, IIRC it also prevented warlock pets from casting.
---
There's certain levels where hellfire is just above and beyond rain of fire. It's over a hundred dps to all mobs sometime in the  lvl 30 range. The entire time me and my friends did SM graveyard runs i would hellfire. They hated me, and the healer eventually just stopped even trying, despite the tank never having aggro. He was 2h fury ( he wouldn't of held it anyway)  I just did an incredible amount of damage. Close to double the aoe mage. So many sacrificed voidwalkers tho
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/ashkandi
---
21k active apparently. It feels like the whole realm is collectively leveling slow as shit though.
---
I went to UBRS as a Mage at 56. I did almost no damage to the bosses but they still took me.
---
Having a tank who doesn't even try to hold aggro because he expects you to be able to kite was something I didn't believe in until recently
---
Why would you start with a nova? It's your main escape tool
---
Wow that sword sucks for being epic and so hard to grind out, that's too bad
---
This happened to me today. I am a mage, but I mage with a brain. I poly'd a mob and almost immediately a dps warrior ran up to it and used rend. FFS dude. It is poly'd for a reason and now I cant repoly.
---
&gt; hamstring kiting has been debunked since day 1. mob attack range is too high
---
Sorry friend but it's still possible to Hamstring kite mobs. You just need to stand farther away than normal. This video explains it very well: https://youtu.be/2Rsx2ARJyXY?t=41
---
Keep in mind it is much much harder with Hamstring Rank 1. By Rank 2 and 3 it gets considerably easier.
---
On my server, it's a serverwide circlejerk of a few idiots who look and talk down to everyone else.
---
One month is not a test. Even six months is not a test.
---
If the Classic servers are still at 'High' population a year from now, THAT would prove something. Due to long time required to achieve stuff on Classic, there's enough content to last almost anyone half a year, but after that, without updates, with stale economy, people would start to leave. A new expansion on Retail, a new non-Blizzard game would cut the population.
---
I, for one, never doubted that Classic would be an initial success. I still doubt it's viable in the long run for high populations.
---
SCATTUH

---
Not everyone cares about min-maxing. It's a video game, let people enjoy things.

Doesnt take 12 hours a day to hit 60. Takes like 7 days played which is like 4 hours a day.

im jealous tbh
---
Saw this stuff happen but it was alliance on my server
---
Every single time you see a guild telling everyone to get fire resist, run.
---
Some asshat told me and my guildes to waste all my goddamn tokens in BC on fire resist for hyjal. 
---
AQ and naxx are a different story but you just don't need fire resist as a non-tank.
---
SOMEBODY SAID CRUSH?
---
ORC SMAHS!
---
ORC CRUSH PUNY RED HUMAN!
---
Lasted until 48. 
---
Definitely right decision. Juicy crits, clear casting, &amp; points in the resto tree.
---
It's called aoe, stay away when spell cleave is mentioned.
---
This was worth a post
---
Good for Blizzard but they really need to step it up. Last weekend I got mistakenly hit with a 3 day ban, and while it was removed within the hour and was compensated for it, or never seen their CS make so many mistakes like this. 
---
Calls I disagree with? Sure. Misinformed? Yeah. But throwing out warnings and bans and getting the wrong person? Not nearly as often as nowadays.
---
Granted, I choose to be optimistic and believe the success of Classic has gotten a lot more new and inexperienced GMs to handle the workload but still...
---
As a prot warrior, I form my own groups and simply boot mouthy DPS that want to pull huge groups for "spell cleave". 
---
IMHO you spend more time waiting for drinking and corpse runs than if you just pull at a normal, steady pace. 
---
TL;DR: Fuck these spell cleave kids.
---
With rank 2 Hellfire and no points in the Bane talent Hellfire is the highest DPS a warlock can do to two targets.  Obviously if one of the mobs needs to be bursted down first you use Shadow Bolt on that mob.
---
The real reward is the free game time we receive along the way.
---
Have you been to that place before?
---
Loving fire, always have. Massive range, huge burst and ambush with pyro.
---
There's a warrior guide by Kargoz in which he states "you will need to weave both movement and abilities between cooldowns in your autos to prevent clipping into animations and missing damage".
---
I can't find any other references on google with regards to this clipping (only cosmetic model clipping), is this feature/bug known by another term so I can find some Youtube videos on what it looks like exactly.
---
No best is Nova, the flame strike + coc ... Both flame strike and coc get the improved Nova crit. You use the coc slow to kite
---
I unsubbed yesterday. It was fun for a bit, but I remembered why I quit. I just don't have the time anymore. :/

Can't we train an AI to automatically remove the [Humor] flair if something isn't funny?

1 month free gametime = 12 extra for you since they got us hooked.
---
On a quality scale from 1 to 10, this photo is extremely shitty.
---
Yeah
---
what are you talking about.
---
this has nothing to do with that, its purely to show you the total exp required to level. obviously the higher you go the more exp u get per mob and quest. thats not what this is for
---
this is simply a funfact type of thing
---
I want Shadowfang. Always have.
---
Ok? what part about that is bad?
---
Its not impressive - theyre noobs
---
This is our way of telling the tank to pull more
---
Lol aspect of the pack
---
Surprised legendaries were not already reserved.
---
True, If I don't wanna join melee/spellcleave, then I dont join it.
---
Literally not harder than that
---
Shut up
---
World is not a "server" anything. It's a private chat owned by a random player. Who owns it changes frequently, and sometimes the person is aware of it and bans people from it. It's basically impossible to get unbanned.
---
LookingForGroup is the only non-local channel blizzard maintains control of.
---
I mean it is pretty much expected that the mage will pull threat and when he is in danger he just novas and walks away while tank picks threat back up. If the healer isn't bad/a shaman and the mage is frost spec with shield/block they can stay in for quite a while. A single mage can shave minutes off the dungeon PER PACK if they aoe properly.
---
Back in wotlk(late tbc? but I think it started with the ubiquity of DKs) melee-stacking arena comps were called cleaves, as opposed to the more balanced RMP, with Wizard Cleave I think being the name for caster-stacked comps. The name is not really drawn from the combat mechanic.
---
(Do you call cone of cold a cleave? I've never really thought of it that way)
---
The irony of posting this while complaining about shit posts... LOL
---
Yes I had the same in several dungeons where my pet rings and everyone congratulated him and pet him and some even gave a piece of food for him on his ding, I really love most interactions with people on classic.
---
What was the addon someone made / posted on reddit for an in-game checklist?
---
like many couples, sit infront of tv  binge watch series holding hands for 6 hours , yes they are real my best friend sold his pc and does this.
---
This post is too real for me.
---
So many friggin retarded Warriors and Mages... I swear to god that even Hunters were not that bad during vanilla.
---
It takes real skill to be so awful.
---
Going for the pet will likely land you a decent distance away from the hunter so that they can actually attack you, possibly one of the worst ways to go about it.
---
Brutal. I spent about 10 hours farming essences and 10 LBRS runs to get my Robes of the Archmage. But didn't spend a dime outside of a few flight paths. It was a pride thing, but grats.
---
Auto renewed and I like it.
---
2 mages plus 1 lock is better if your not in stockades or ZF.  The ability to TP out for repairs and get summoned straight back is being overlooked by a lot of people.  There's also soulstone and the fact that Hellfire is higher DPS than mage AoE a lot of the time.  You really only need 2 mages to have the mobs permanently CCed.
---
With the AE grinding capailities of a mage, you do something wrong if you don't have your mount at 40.
---
Besides that, you basically need to only buy upgrades for 4 or 5 spells in total while leveling
---
IKR? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre using group finder and finding themselves automatically placed into a cleave group. Either they can make their own, or ignore the people wanting to do cleave. Pretty simple.
---
God damn Zperl is ugly, you do you. But if you ever change your mind, take a look at Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
Noice
---
i don‚Äôt understand 
---
when would i use this?
---
I mean what your saying isn‚Äôt wrong really, but you couldn‚Äôt out yourself as a spellcleave beta make any harder than by posting this haha
---
Because it's so good?
---
Only ability that isn't normalized in 1.12 is the Shaman's Whirlwind enchant. Faster weapons are *better*.
---
Thank you all for the responses!
---
you have to utilize sheep resets to get mana and make them run out of mana. There is a lot of patients with it. This is a great video by [Method Xaryu.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8678CssUkdA) on how to approach the match up.
---
Rogues get a lot of their dps from the weapon damage, and this has really high weapon damage (56-105, compared to the best swords at that level which have 45-86 damage range) The healer is going to use it as a stat stick but the rogue would dramatically increase their dps with it. Plus spirit is a pretty good stat for rogue leveling.
---
Enhance all the way man
---
Mmmm interesting so you are tanking as fury or DPS? 
---
What is the rotation of moves and I what is your main stance. Would like to try this out sounds very fun üëç
---
it certainly is, did you partake in the Hillsbrad war last night?
---
Todo checklist
---
Wtf is spellcleave?
---
I feel like this whole melee cleave/mage cleave thing is getting out of hand..
---
Yesterday i was planning on going through BRD with a few randoms (2 mages, a warlock and a priest healer. Im the tank) and we didnt even get to the arena until they all called me out for not pulling more than 2 packs at a time.
---
I tried to tell them that i cant tank 10 mobs at the same time and keep aggro while they spam blizzard etc. And even when we wiped after i pulled more than 3 packs they blamed me for being a bad tank... And that they should "just get a other mage".
---
Is tankning warriors even a thing anymore in dungeons?
---
My thoughts tooo!!
---
Hmm it says Water of Flint.  Does that means anything to anyone?
---
&gt;	Makes you wonder how they "checked" and "confirmed" rbg trading when you never even entered a rbg
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äù in that case was most likely an algorithm that was initially believed to be functioning as intended. It was most likely gathering information surrounding the trading, and enough things added up to create the false positive.
---
The amount of appeals must have been so overwhelming that not much time was available to spend on each individual appeal case. This resulted in mass denials of appeals.
---
Then the mistake was caught, algorithm patched up, and they un-banned, then re-banned those who were marked positive by this new algorithm.
---
Algorithms can get incredibly complicated, and sometimes faulty solutions get deployed. Can‚Äôt ask for much more than a reversal of consequences and an apology in a timely manner.
---
I‚Äôve had PUGs scatter their focus, but I don‚Äôt hear a lot of whining about it. I‚Äôm only lvl 28, though, so I‚Äôm usually able to reassert control or just let the fight play out when things go sideways.
---
Saw a hunter with this and herods shoulder yesterday
---
If we have multiple people that can aoe, we should be aoeing. 
---
If I am the only person that can aoe, I single target to skull &gt; cross &gt; others. 
---
I generally expect this is how all groups do it. 
---
I however did have a tank last night yell at me for not attacking the marks...
---
when he wasn't marking anyone...
---
and he himself was constantly swapping targets... So no... I could not just attack his target... so I just put my ravager on and spun.
---
What determines lava damage in brd emp runs? I've never died but sometimes i group with dps that die 3 times in lava.
---
I think its a bit different tho, all of the classic players start off at level 1. In wotlk the playerbase was spread out on characters from lvl 1-70 when it first released. Blizzard also expects more people to quit classic, and in classic it is much more important to have a decent amount of players, getting 40 lvl 60s is much harder than getting 25 lvl 85s.
---
"I am a merciful god"
---
It's mostly about immersion and realism. Physical mail takes time to deliver.
---
I consider the AH cut as an express shipping charge so the buyer gets it right away.... just wondering when they will come out with an Azeroth Prime membership
---
Ravanger for AOE mob pulls and WW for single target due to stats.
---
&gt; also a waste of gold to buy hamstring 2 and above
---
I could see the argument for the first two but this is 100% wrong advice. Each rank of Hamstring gives 5% additional slow. That's hugely important for mob kiting, PvP, retreating from mobs, etc.
---
You can do whatever you want but it's not "min maxing" when someone tells you the weapon is actually bad after you say it's awesome for a spec, it's correcting misinformation.
---
If you feel attacked by the fact that you struggle with classic dungeons and raids while most groups can mindlessly spreedrun through them, I am sorry, it was not my intention :) 
---
You can run and gun through every classic dungeon with no problems just as you can run and gun through every retail dungeon. Point is, WoW classic and, if you leave high mytic+ out, retail as well are not difficult games if you know how your class works and what to do. So stop being so delusional and calm down dawg! I will never understand why it is an insult to claim someone plays retail, it seems like in your mind you can only like on version of WoW and everyone who claims otherwise gets insulted. 
---
but it just shows you take all of this waaaaay to serious. 
---
What dungeons do you have problems with in classic? Maybe I can give you some tips so you can speedrun them aswell and be more efficient.
---
So stay safe buddy and maybe go out once in a while! Afterall WoW is just a game and meant to make you happy not sad and angry :)
---
Actually, just noticing this sub trending down the same path that r/wow took.
---
Aren't fastest raid clears in the world done using Troll warriors?
---
The Berserking is an insane ability.
---
lock here, when warrior pulls i indeed dot all of them one by one before i start shadowbolt spam or drain life spam. and i am glad if i get aggro to lighten the weight on the warriors shoulders. there is no way i will die, aff warlocks are as tanky as warriors, we have drain life and green healthstones remember. and if i tap to low hp, i do it on purpose cuz i have a plan. i am not even asking for heals. do you want me to sit and drink like mages? yall underestimate the warlocks hp regen ways. 
---
Stop making drama out of everything. you will not understand it till you play warlock
---
and stop bitching about them tapping, if you dont wanna heal, dont do it. we never ask for it anyway. we literally regen to full health with drain life and siphon life with only 8 second channel which is way faster than actually eating food.
---
truuu
---
I'll take my AOE root now, plz.
---
Without reddit, what would the world be?
---
World is just  a cesspoool for the same 4 d saur mafiosos to post {CHEAPER THEN AH, BiS in Slot} over and over
---
Exactly! Why can‚Äôt we have that!? I don‚Äôt want to spend hours and hours grinding, I want to spend money to advance quicker.  That‚Äôs freakin awesome and they are missing out on millions by not offering that
---
Actually a good deal 5000 gold had to cost a few hundred $ from the Chinese
---
Yes.  That's how they balance out.  For weapons of same rarity and level, they *usually* have similar DPS stats.  So take a weapon that does 20 DPS.  On a 2.4 timer, that means it averages 48 damage.  On a 3.6 timer, it will average 72 damage.
---
This is why slower = more damage.
---
i think hes for real
---
What name got reported and made change to be named gotreported
---
Honestly. It‚Äôs even better not knowing, and getting to explore fresh nook and cranny of the world
---
My experience killing Bangalash. Group with a trash hunter who manages to aggro a tiger and panther while he's running around like a doofus, proceeds to wipe us both
---
You might replace that chest with T2 chest, if it gave you set bonuses. T1 is garbage compered to truefaith.
---
We should start charging them Water bills!
---
Are there still free server transfers if my server is full?
---
Just go to Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Activation, then do troubleshooting and pick the option saying that you've recently changed hardware.
---
99% chances it will work ‚Äì as long as you have a Microsoft account connected. 
---
This is essentially the only reason why I actually caved in and did it.
---
Wouldn't it be a great idea to make your own raid pug where you dont invite anyone from your own class? Of course you couldn't do it as a mage, but perhaps as a druid or a tank warrior?
---
Rug‚Äôs facepalm sums this up
---
No reason not to. Dogs have like 2.6k hp. If everyone else in the dungeon is doing ANYYHING. then the Blizz will be more than enough.
---
Being on the roof of the arena is against the rules
---
Now the aoe guys should learn to not join normal runs expecting it to be aoe farm and i will be a happy grp leader.
---
Considering that at no point did I say anything about people pulling aggro, you're obviously referring to another post of mine.  Which should be made inconceivably clear by the fact that I reference it directly with "If you're talking about the post replying" so I'm not sure why you are confused.
---
It's not the cost, it's the cooldown and the fact that I have to make sure to have the reagents on me at all times
---
+healing isn't a "stat stick" for healers. It's more equivalent, although less impactful, to the dps on a rogue's weapons. That mace happens to be the second best one handed healing item in the game pre-raid. Healers basically don't have an alternative to that mace until BRD, rogues have other weapon options.
---
I'm not saying rogues shouldn't be interested in it, I'm saying healers should get first dibs on the very few items that have +healing on them.
---
/insert star wood here
---
I'm saying 1% of the people that run this method actually do it to a level that it's worth, and 99% are idiots that can't think for themselves thinking the best way to do something is only the methods streamers use.  They die over and over (or at all) and insist its someone else's fault.
---
Thanks mate! Appreciate the help.
---
I'm just an overly nice person in general, if I'm close to death and a horde saves my life, it's going to mean that much more than if an ally saved me. Everyone's just trying to get through the grind of questing and I'd feel even more like a dick making it worse then it is. Though it was difficult to pull 3 mobs off, if I aoe'd at all he would died and I cant poly tapped targets, it was close haha.
---
Dont roll horde on noggen. We don't need any more of them
---
Normalised applies to any over 3.3 doesn't it and under works as usual. 
---
So a 3.6 would be calculated as 3.3 and anything under 3.3 is calculated off of its own value.
---
How long have you played wow?
---
Oof
---
It is pay to win. Gold means a lot in vanilla
---
Common sense requires zero evidence, thankfully.
---
The only evidence for this that will ever exist is data ATVI will never release.  They've changed plenty of things recently to make it harder to check populations, wasn't a coincidence this was done 15 years in, gold sellers didn't just become spammy problems in the last month.
---
ETC.  Have fun being wrong if you think otherwise!
---
and back to hell and back again.
---
Lol as a pally, leveling ain‚Äôt so bad but dear lord when my seal of command procs off a parry and they dodge it... my mage alt is looking mighty nice.
---
I know exactly what it is, that's why I used those words.
---
uh no, you could previously roof camp and it was allowed. They changed their tune with remastered
---
Please seek counseling.
---
Ah yeah i remember a time in vanilla when there were no streamers and barely youtube activity. Good times.
---
The difference is negligible. I have another video on my profile of me killing them when they were yellow. Ive 1v1d 60s at 52
---
Easiest PR of Blizzard's life
---
urmom is a ten slot wand.
---
or something.
---
That's good to know. I guess in my limited IT knowledge I am thinking they are looking at quick geo location changes as a flag for using an account sharing service. Using my VPN I could log in between Australia and China in the space of 30 seconds. Perhaps I am not giving Blizz enough credit and they can somehow tell it's a VPN.
---
The community has become quite divisive on the forums, and I'm noticing it becoming more hostile ingame as well.
---
As time passes, I'm noticing attitudes develop as people cement into their class identities. And it's definitely not all good.
---
Good luck leveling in phase 2.
---
Peasant.
---
Still what's the name tho :D
---
Can you convert that to spellcleave units?
---
Probably not sadly
---
I started a mage as a bank alt, but decided I wanted to be able to disenchant my own drops, so I leveled him to 5. And that levelling was the easiest 30 mins of game time I've ever had in WoW. 
---
I'm actually disgusted at how easy it was.
---
It‚Äôs a bit of a catch 22 that they are waiting for population numbers to drop before releasing pvp stuff. 
---
The people who just want to do pvp stuff will stop playing because there is no pvp stuff, and it will seem like population is finally low enough to take away layering, then pvp stuff will come out and all the people interested in pvp will come back and population will be too high again.
---
That reminds me, i need to set my resub to like 6 months.  I am deffo gonna be sticking around haha.    
---
But tbh, i think so many piggyback classic off from Retail that there won't be any major drop.  I expect a slight drop though. But nothing at all major.
---
Ty. Forgot to unsub
---
I'VE COME TO SEIZE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION
---
Lol fucking wasted.  A binding on a rogue.
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
Then there's Dun Morogh a snowy land right in the center of the continent
---
Is frost nova considered as spellcleave when it's clearly affect everything around you and not just in front of you and few targets like cleave do.
---
Just noob players - just like 90% of the people in this thread shitting on mages. Theyve never played wow before and don't know how to fight them - plenty of classes can beat mages easily
---
Im assuming using a 2 hand slam build?
---
6mp5 is quite a big part of the chests itemization. Its not the +5 healing. But i do agree that mace enchant/eye should be prio. Grinding robes can be pain in the ass too, from experience.
---
Not according to my source, but even if it does it's still a minor point. Faster weapons still pushback more and overkill less.
---
I just reached level 30 with my warrior and got the whirlwind axe quest. I tried farming the bloodscalp guys but pretty much everything with this quest is impossible for me to do on my level.
---
Is there any other place I can get some useful equip for my level?
---
go back to fortnite
---
Looks like now mass thinks that layering is bad, huh?
---
Yeah, even if everything sells, I‚Äôm gonna have to spend at least one more day fishing
---
Ive been arms 2h tanking everything up till ST with and without mages. Its just about knowing how big a pull your group can handle.
---
Yeah I work compressed nights, have been also packing and moving for this last month, and have found time to make it to lvl 35. Mostly just time management.
---
Why? You strike me as someone who has never played wow before and doesnt know how to pvp.
---
Then I tank, I dont really care if one dps is tanking one mob out of the pack. Sometimes its a fury/arms warrior and he gets more rage if his hit too, so that might be alright, altogether.
---
However. People dont kill runners. kill the bloody runners guys. dont just switch targets.
---
I dont invite hunters anymore however, and Im sorry, if I miss out on a good hunter, but I have seen to many multi shots fly over me as Im about to pull, and I simply can not take it anymore.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one. I think it annoys me more because of the click bait titles assigned to his videos
---
Or some people just like being nice.
---
Nobody is saying it seriously at this point.
---
Its like a grown man boxing a child
---
Is the formula enchant shield - superior spirit worth much? It‚Äôs +9 to spirit and there are no listings on my AH for it.
---
So when you see something and you don't attack it, you don't kill on sight. You miss 100% of the kills you don't attempt.
---
Same thing happened to me but I stuck around and stole the next guy's tag. It's a vicious cycle. In my defense I didn't actually know you could get the quest again.
---
Same, they roll on fucking everything. They act like they need a set of gear for every hour of the day.
---

!RemindMe 1 day
---
If you‚Äôre Alliance it‚Äôs ideal to start at 30. Dunno for Horde. Desolace?
---
Where do guilds advertise? Is that in that channel?
---
[First message is guild spam garbage]
---
I just don't get why all the freaking streamers need to be annoying, douchy little white boys. Just for once I'd love to find a streamer that isn't a total dipshit.
---
Druids have absurd armour, they can also rejuv before pulls, use rage to heal.. etc.
---
Pallies are fucking garbage tanks and take the most damage
---
It's not unless it crits (usually with a shatter), it's base damage is slightly lower than CoC and costs a good deal more mana.
---
&gt;If you tank you want as fast as a weapon as you can get because more swings equals more rage and more rage equals more threat.
---
Is this true? You‚Äôll generate more rage per hit with a slower weapon that has more base damage so the same is kinda true for tanking. I‚Äôd like to see the math on this because I‚Äôve read some guides and they seem split on fast vs slow for threat generation.
---
I've tanked some of these and you're right. You feel pretty useless after the mages have cc'd in place and have their nova on chain.
---
Best thing I found was to keep up demo shout, throw on your 2h and try to peel off stragglers back into the aoe. If the group is good then it can be quite fun and a refreshing change of pace to questing and normal dungeons but I can't imagine doing it all the way to 60!
---
I was helping a horde druid with the chicken escort quest in Feralas few days ago and halfway through a shaman jumps in trying to kill me. Running away from his own tremor totem didn't help him in a fight against warlock however so I quickly managed to catch up with my new friend and finish the quest with them.
---
I did the same exact thing...see OP..don't feel bad. We are all newbies again.
---
Lol... maybe a destro lock... but most locks are running affliction and you arent dealing with much fire there. Not to mention a felhunter will dispel the mage
---
They technically can, but unless it's a really recent tame the chances of that happening are basically nil.
---
lol, just wait for 3 mins
---
Is that an exploit because the guards can't path up to the roofs?
---
undead dont beg
---
I dont think thats what he meant...
---
I had a dwarf chase me from bottom of brd to redbridge mountains and thelmasar . He never wanted to break away. I kept polying him and showing him off to lowbies.
---
I wouldnt be so quick to give up on this quest. I recently did it myself at lvl 30. When killing the blood scalp guys you'll need a helper, but people are always around to party up from what I've seen. The rest of the stuff you need can be bought from the AH and I had no difficulty getting a higher level to kill the boss for me. I hope you get it soon!
---
I think that by going any hybrid class you will end up or healing or tanking so you will waste your time rerroling a warrior. I would say that you only left to level till 60 and gear up in pre raid bis so in raids you will dps. If it still hurts your experience I would recommend to play mage because its easier than warlock like 5 times compared to dot management and rotation.
---
Yep
---
They take the most damagae, and are mana required.
---
I have done more 60 dungeons than you most likely. I have healed druids, warriors and pally tanks.. I know which suck to heal and which are good to heal.
---
I dont give a fuck about their aoe dmg. my only concern is how they are to heal, and pallies are the fucking worst
---
Esfand
---
It‚Äôs like looking at a couch from 4 feet away, at a 45 degree angle, and trying to measure how wide it is by stretching a measuring tape at arm‚Äôs length.
---
Maybe at end game but in world PVP I've had no problems thusfar. When I see a priest, I gank.
---
BC normalized CC times. Mostly because of arena required it. Imagine a rogue sapping at the start of 2v2 and it being 45 seconds?
---
A warrior man.  Paladins can't really tank raids
---
Been down that road a few times. No dice. I have a Microsoft account tied to an old email that I can't access anymore.
---
Wait you can't have both an alliance and a horde character on the same realm? Man that sucks. How did Angwe spy do it then?
---
Paladins don't function as tanks outside of dungeons.
---
Isn‚Äôt this that movie with the kid and Bruce Willis?
---
What do you do when he blinks, roots you and then spam frostbolt?
---
Plot twist, you're a mage
---
Oh no ...
---
AFAIK the resistance chance is based on your level, not the spell's.
---
Many guides suggest not leveling certain skills and I would think at least one would mention a negative effect like resistance and I've never seen it mentioned.
---
Well I still reckon it should be tuned up more :)
---
What specs should it be?
---
Haha same! I've got the onea from fair banks but they just don't match
---
Had a hero flood the AH with charms for 2s. Sent him a letter in his mail thanking him.
---
For me only real problem is those "layer inv please" people. Can't stand that every 5 minutes someone in guild is asking for layer invite.
---
Lion?
---
I play a warrior-druid duo with my wife, so we're optimal for kill quests. Always disband and group up to the limit for named mob/boss quests. Oftentimes for kill quests also, when the place is overcrowded.
---
But here come collection quests, the more people in the party, the longer it gets. I wouldn't mind if it was like that in vanilla, but it wasn't. The original design and mechanics didn't account for such overabundance of players. Neither layering nor increasing spawn rates help meet the demand. I want to believe that Flizzard simply wasn't aware how mamy people will come, but for a multi-million dollar small indie studio, they are doing a poor job of anticipating and mitigating the problem.
---
I no longer have the time to spend hours doing a SINGLE quest (i.e. Kurzen camp). I wish all you people the best and envy your patience.
---
Bfa babies call aoe this way because they saw some streamer or something. Annoying.
---
eight of your gay mileage.
---
I honestly feel like i'm going mad when i browse this subreddit. I've got 12 days played now, I've grouped with easily over 1k of every class for various shit @60 (outside of druids) and I've yet to find any one class is more retarded than the average player of another but this sub will beat the idea that one class is clearly the worst into you like it's just fact.
---
Like this argument here, that basically they don't know how do anything but use blizzard despite AoE farming relying on;
---
Polying archers / LoS them to avoid going OOM in 5 seconds and wiping.  
---
CSing caster / LoS them for the exact same reason.    
---
Novaing runners / fireblasting them because if they pull anymore mobs you'll wipe due to the fact you only have the mana to clear one wave.    
---
Decurse and threat i'll give you, but not removing dots/poisons or managing threat is a universal problem @60. Tons of classes have niche abilities that simply aren't used until 60, such as shackle undead. I've had to explain to priests what it does a few times, that doesn't make them retarded or bad; they've literally had no use for it until then and prior to BrD i legit don't think you'll use decurse outside of PvP.
---
I've seen 3 mages instagib themselves @60 with frost nova though, which is hilariously bad because you should learn that happens the first time you try nova a group solo.
---
No legit questions? Okay.
---
Well, I am 48, finished Tanaris, ZF, Feralas, and Mara quests. Where to next?

When you're doing confirmation or double check, you can't just... do nothing? You have to actually look at something very simple like "Has this guy ever even been in a rated battleground?" Otherwise you're doing nothing but saying "Yep, you were banned. That must have been justified because you were banned". It's asinine. Also, if you're overwhelmed with false positives, that's a pretty good indicator that... you're overwhelmed with false positives. If 37 times the number/percentage of people are appealing a ban wave compared to the last one, maybe you should just instantly assume you dun goofed.
---
Put it this way. I've submitted probably less than 10 tickets in 15 years of playing WoW on and off. For the money I've spent, you can afford to have a guy actually do his job once every 1.5 years when I submit a ticket. Who are these people spamming tickets?

Wow that's awesome. Surprised the ubrs packs before drakk aren't giving you threat issues between so many mobs. Well played, bud.
---
Thank you, mate!
---
Silver pine is way too low for you, you should be In Hillsbrad, ashenvale and stonetalon
---
Imagine being this unemployed lmfao
---
I am biassed, but i'd say abso-flipping-lutely.  As long as the genre is to your liking.    
---
I mean, they brought a 14 year old game back, because people wanted it back.  And many posts here are a testament to how good it is.    
---
When i started i knew nothing about WoW or MMO's.  And tbh that was only a pluss. Dive in and get immersed.
---
I would rather have a levelingguide that focusses on rep gain while leveling instead of speed
---
Im with you,  I've got some serious time spent on 4 expansions and had no idea what it meant to the point I was reading this post to work it out.
---
Just tried a duel against a guild mage friend and he destroyed me after I applied what you said, I just get CC'd to death, he iceblocks my blind but still destroys me
---
Spell worgen backwards?
---
Yes, phase two.
---
Uhh, yes? It‚Äôs not that difficult.
---
IIRC this is normal on these sorts of bans. Often people are taken all their items and instead get a set of greens.
---
Felwood, Hinterlands, Searing Gorge
---
Ahahhhhahahah now im reading your post history and youve been bitching at people over wow for days 
---
Lmaooooo

"so I just put on my ravager and tanked."*
---
FTFY.
---
of course its the mage
---
 A lot of people used vacation time to rush 60
---
Bots and multiboxers are miles apart different
---
ikr xD
---
nah its like buddle-la buddalum
---
Is there an addon for this? I have my little sheet next to my keyboard, but it is not really helpful...
---
Had a macro in the beginning with /tar and then the names...but it was full pretty fast.
---
lol...wait what?
---
Heh, yeah.... Well...
---
This time around I can just pay for the six months and save that money. It's so nice to not worry about paying for something that was purely for entertainment, not to mention not having to go Walmart every month and buy my time on a card.
---
*The whole thing?* All 2 sentences? 
---
I read it man. Get a job.
---
Cleaves aren't cone effects. Cleaves hit nearby targets. See the actual ability 'cleave,' sweeping strikes, blade flurry, etc. Cone effects i would bundle in aoe. The area of effect is just a cone.
---
Yup looks like it!
---
"plotte" is a french slang for pussy. This made me laugh.
---
Thank you, I need my daily dose of randomness
---
More rage per slower hit means when you miss or get dodge or parried it punishes you more. I believe dagger tanking is viable until higher gear levels then other weapons out pace them. Dagger tanking will probably be fine until BWL.
---
yea no need for prot until you start raiding really. you will be able to tank dungeons just fine as arms while leveling, and questing will be soo much easier
---
today i entered a group as a hunter with an enhancement shaman, a rogue, a priest, and a 'whirlwind tank"
---
It went about as well as you might think.
---
What happens is we wait for the mage to be at over 5k damage done before we start Hellfire and we still pull aggro of every mob in 1-2 ticks.
---
Nice pic
---
This is a superb idea. I found myself hobbling through NE start area as a human, flipping through pages online. Trying to figure out which quests gave what rep. When to do what quest. Worrying about avoiding mobs to prevent over leveling. It just got annoying so I stopped. I know it should be easy. Please post findings here.
---
I mean typical level if he's a level lower or 2 is fine.  Im not a stickler.  I never complain I may think he's shitty for it.  But i don't roll need on it if I'm more than one away because 2 levels takes me a few days past 30 and 40 to reach so i don't worry.  If he's the only need roll and it's his class i wouldn't care at all.  Im generally laid back.

How do you move character nameplate to be next to your character?

$563 of $1,200¬†per month
---
I will start working on the first issue of the¬†"A Classic Journey"¬†comic book.
---
Set within the World of Warcraft universe, we'll join two groups of characters as they embark in a journey filled with hardship, strife and unexpected lessons.
---
One group start their journey in the harsh, rugged land of Durotar, home to the newly settled orcs of Draenor and the native Darkspear trolls. However, the winds are changing, and they utter words of dark, wicked forces gathering within the great Horde's home, Orgrimmar.
---
The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king,¬†Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.
---
Though worlds apart, both of these parties will realize that old wounds never heal.
---
They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.
---
Cheers guys!
---
Lotta love and thank you for the crazy feedback!
---
Can confirm Atiesh is chill AF.

You pretend like layering is the only solution here. They completely messed up with the initial server amount, the issue would already only be half as big if they started with like 15 PvP Realms instead of 2. They could also have introduced server transfers much sooner and not when most people are already level 40. Hell, they could even have a hard population cap on a server, sounds harsh, but still better than layering.
---
Probably to cut down on trash talking and spying from the opposite faction. Still possible with multiple accounts, of course
---
Hehe xD
---
There are a handful of quests you can get done in the Hinterlands, if you haven‚Äôt done that already. Otherwise you‚Äôre ready for Searing Gorge at 48. Leave the elite quests there for a later run though or do it with a friend üëç
---
Some people play on PvP servers to shit on everyone, and others play to shit even harder on the people shitting on everyone.
---
Haha, thank you! xD
---
that person has buffs, HP, and mana; a ghost cannot have those last time i checked
---
1 guy out of 4 doing less damage but the healer not having to drink every second pull means a faster run.
---
Thank you, mate! Will do!
---
It really depends on what kind of site you buy on. On an actual legit site for my server it would be aprox. 108‚Ç¨ per 100 Gold.  (with Legit I mean that you can be sure they won't scam you and they know what they are doing). 
---
Ps.: I didn't buy Gold from them, but I buy a lot of other stuff from there and thus know they are legit.
---
The guards in gadgetzan have guns. I have been shot and knocked down myself several times when I accidentally attack people on the ground and aggro the guards.
---
The problem is that the guards patrol around, and aren't always near the person being attacked.
---
Because the meta is cancer but stupid people are also cancer. Only me who plays my own build is correct. 
---

You can!
---
Insane luck jarvis
---
Nah Spy is borderline cheating.
---
Spy is a great addon for this
---
But...when your corpse is on the boat, you get revived after the loading screen. It is pretty common to do this for shits and giggles. Just don't release spirit.
---
Nobody knows the price without knowing your realm economy.
---
Since it is the only one on the AH, you decide the price. How much gold do you think the average shaman healer has?
---
I mean, it sounds like combining the melee cleaving with spells, which is why arena compositions have used that name and other variations for many years. I get that if it's used to describe one part without the other it makes no sense but otherwise it's fine.
---
More hit is always king, majority of damage is white swings which have an absurd high hit cap. More white = more rage = more abilites etc.
---
Please just don't start with fashion of creating pub groups where leader try to "reserve" something.
---
damn bro nice!
---
Awesome. Headed there now. Ty.
---
Eh. There are to many people everywhere that aoe farming is hardly as easy as people say. Sure, it works if you can actually get a good pull.
---
Dunno. I've tried to do it as often as I can but most of the time I just focus one target down at a time because it takes so long to find good groups to pull. Though probably much easier after you get your mount.
---
Toxic horrors in felwood for essence of water.
---
&gt; why do we never see a post ‚Äúi got wronged by GM, I submitted report and got apology and GM fixed my issue!‚Äù Type of posts? This is fandom, those posts would get upvoted way up.
---
Because that's *incredibly* boring. Why on earth would anyone upvote something completely mundane? I've had a couple issues over the years with GMs that went fine. Don't remember exactly what they were, now, because they went fine--but they happened to *me* and my brain finds them too uninteresting to bother recalling.
---
A friend of mine bought Gold every now and then on retail. He just met some guy outside of SW and they traded it over.
---
You forgot Felwood, which you'll need to do at least a little of if you have plans to go to Winterspring. This guide sucks.
---
Hey, mate! Commissions are currently closed but I might reopen them soon. If you're interested and not in a hurry, feel free to drop an email at vladharabagiuart@gmail.com
---
Right? I just finished that at lvl 23 with a lot of help from guild and one pickup run through SFK. Such an insane damage boost with that 2h mace. Love it.
---
As someone who also had never played WoW prior to Classic I can definitely say that this has been one of the most unique and engaging MMO experience for me. Is it for everyone? Absolutely not because it's not for the faint of heart and those who enjoy a more "casual" experience.  
---
That being said, Classic is the true epitome of an MMORPG.  
---
M- The game is massive in the sense that everything feels grand from the moment you almost die to that level 1 boar in the starting zone to going on a pilgrimage to get the next flight-path for 30 minutes to raiding with your guild and slaying a dragon that can easily wipe your entire group in a single blow if someone doesn't pay attention.  
---
MO - Classic is the most social MMO i have ever played, period. People will randomly buff you as you pass down the street, people will be actively looking for people to group with because it's a lot easier to kill that level 1 boar with 2 players than with and there's faction loyalty with the Alliance vs Horde system where you can collectively spit on the opposing faction in chat because EVERYONE has died to the opposing faction at least once.  
---
RPG - Classic is an immersive experience where you are living in this world from the moment you load up the game and log in, you are your character. That person who killed you while you were questing? They didn't just kill your character, hell no, they just wasted at minimum 10+ minutes of YOUR time running back there so you throw his name up in zone chat or guild chat, whatever you have to do to get sweet vengeance. You feel a sense of victory when you overcome a tough situation where enemies are respawning all around you and you fight your way out of a cave with some complete randoms before adding them as a friend for later on down the track. It is moments like these that are why players who played WoW Vanilla are so peeved with the current state of the game because I also tried Retail before Classic launched and it feels like every other MMO where you just hop aboard the "progression train" and follow the pre-laid train tracks.  
---
TL:DR - Spend the subscription price to get that first month (it's only $15 USD) which gives you Classic for "free" and try the game out for yourself... Be warned though, it may consume you and you'll hate yet love all of us at the same time that are telling you to get it.
---
I started on HS as a fresh server. It was pretty fair until this last round of xfers. I've already rerolled servers.
---
Thank you, mate! Well, there are good days and bad days. xD
---
Most guides were thrashed out on private servers, and the rep gain on pservers vs Classic/vanilla is wrong. Classic/vanilla rep gain is about half. 
---
You can do the whole NE start area plus Ashenvale to around 22-24 if you want to max Nelf rep. There are plenty of guides around for the area. 
---
Don‚Äôt use a pserver rep guide as it will be wrong.
---
It is not that hard. Main reason I hadn't had it was because I skilled Alchemy to 300 in the meantime.
---
I dont remember these bindings dropping so often..
---
They thought we didn't, but we did.
---
Get an addon that tells you energy/mana ticks. Drink just before the tick and you will get a tick of mana regen from your conjured water without having to sit or stop. For myself, I use luna unit frames to show the mana/energy regen tick. You can see it over my mana bar. In this example video I miss a couple of times, on the 5th and 10th/last drink.
---
Thanks for the reminder, I just unsubbed liked planned. It was a very nice trip down nostalgia lane but I have to quit now before it consumes me
---
No, it isn't. You're just bad at reading graphs. All the information you need to understand this is right there. Anyone thinking this has to do with however many enemies you need to kill or whatever (I don't even know what people think this is, because the information presented is clear) is just not reading the information.
---
Come to the dark side
---
And I agreed with you? Except for the part where prices will ever go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? I don‚Äôt see anywhere in my comment where it says or even looks like I‚Äôm saying your wrong. Kook

---
that's the joke lol
---
Herbs after level 45 go for quite a lot.
---
&gt;also, it could be that the healer is not specced for healing. Most healing trees have % threat reduction from spells.
---
Even in full healing specs, most ppl wont take those talents anyways. Waste of talentpoints in almost all cases.
---
Amazing! I‚Äôve been a bit out of the loop! Is it working in classic?
---
As a frost mage, this is so fucking funny, thank you man
---
I mean I agree but like also there's plenty of other guilds and people with no lives who try to beat APES but weren't even close, which makes them the best in the world and therefore amazing.
---
I feel like this is an assumption of aoe mage clears. I have used shield my entire time leveling and really never have trouble holding aggro and generating threat. I don't get a fat pool of rage like I would with a 2H but I'm not really spamming offensive abilities anyways, just keeping up shouts and sundering and throwing in some other abilities here and there
---
yea it was
---
Name change merges?
---
We should add this is a stat.... Lmao. 
---
Armor pen too!!!
---
/who g-Illuminatus
---
Nope you're was right...
---
Nice dude
---
Which is probably intended. They also have nets btw.
---
its not a bug, this is a normal world drop
---
What addon is that for your character and enemy? Looks clena
---
They will get warned by a gm and will stop hopefully.
---
Griff?  That's def an eagle bro...but agreed he ain't got time fo dat...
---
Same, mind you I was on the brink of death the entire time
---
Are there instant raid groups in classic wow?
---
Ya i tank my groups. Never invite huntards.
---
Oh totally. I'm currently 40 and I have been switching between stv, badlands and arathi highlands constantly, throwing in maybe 1-2 armory meleecleave runs when I just want to watch streams
---
They take 50g for wasting their time on a run they get nothing else out of. You are trying to get gear, you just want charity? Get a guild and some friends if you want favors.
---
If memory serves it was because back in the day a 3.8 - 4.0 weapon was a tonne better than some upgrades, same applies to the other weapons and they were getting a little out of hand damage wise. 
---
Hunters used to be able to pick up a gun that was around 3.6 speed and cause chaos with aimed shot, into multishot.
---
Git gud.
---
In all seriousness though, I'm not 15 anymore and I don't have enough time to enjoy works PvP as well as level so I ended up moving server after getting to 38. I'm on a PvE realm now and can safely washer Hillsbrad and STV in peace :)
---
I think its US Stalagg Horde, pretty sure I played with SneakyTom yesterday
---
Amen
---
archetype is important
---
in retail when it was back in the day (vanilla) mages were not popular
---
they are only popular now because everyone knows how broken they are
---
warriors will be popular no matter how bad they are because the hero in plate armor w/ a big 2h is just an attractive archetype
---
just like in Destiny 2, on PC the hunter class struggles in PVP yet is somehow really popular... because a space ninja assassin is just a really cool archetype
---
Solar Hunters (golden gun class) in destiny 2 were the 2nd most popular class in PVP (just by play usage) but dead last or 2nd to dead last for K/D and win rate because the spec actually wasnt good despite looking/feeling cool
---
also throughout WoWs history druids have had times where they were really good but not popular
---
a game should be balanced for gameplay first and then class representation... a class shouldnt be artificially suppressed just because it looks or feels cool to play
---
I don't see where this would be useful, but it's good to know.
---
Most likely just a visual bug
---
Not a mage, but shouldn't Geddon be immune?
---
maybe world of warcraft is the wrong game for you? it was always like this to farm gear
---
Switched to a 6-month sub
---
Yeah, all healing gear. Too bad if you don't like healing. But that is classic, I suppose.
---
It's not because Warriors have taunt, they can use Shield Block which mitigates a LOT of damage making it easier for healers.  
---
That being said, each tank has their own perks, Paladin has a lot of useful utility in their kit , Warriors have superior mitigation and Bears have the highest threat generation in the game at the cost of being the squishiest tank of the three. This idea of Warrior being the only tank is being contested because once upon a time they were the only tank because "Shield Block" but now with the advent of dual wield tanking, it can be argued that as long as your healers can keep you alive then generating more threat through more DPS is more valuable than mitigating more damage because you can run things faster so the new tier list would be Fury Warrior Tank, Feral Tank Druid, Prot Warrior, Prot Pally.
---
At 50 I would recommend finishing up feralas and tanaris, then do searing gorge, burning steppes, azshara, felwood, blasted lands, un'goro crater, winterspring and the plaguelands.
---
I have a 60 and a 41 right now.  On a Horde dominated server, you're just fucked.  People are bored at 60 and enjoy killing lowbies.  I really don't know what to tell you.  30-45 has been absolutely brutal.  Levels that should take 2-3 hours are taking 4.
---
My tips:
---
-Play offpeak hours
---
-Go to less populated zones (ie:  desolace maybe instead of stv).  Anywhere in the 30s sucks though.
---
-Make friends and dungeon grind.
---
Lol I had a dps warrior do the same thing. Insta charge mob that I wasn't targeting. Caused us to full man wipe in Cath as he pulled a bunch of elites and boss. He then also needed on the shield that drops after he said he only needed quests no drops. And he was a dual wielding fury dps. So I garauntee he never used that shield
---
This is just a shitty way of gatekeeping players who don't have the best manners or believe in the same thing as you. Raging at other people or taking their nodes doesn't make the game single player, if anything it makes the game more multiplayer as you're always dealing with competition.
---
If someone can use something, someone can use something. I'm not a greedy guy. I know I will eventually get everything once I'm 60 and in a steady raiding guild. I'm always happy when ANYONE gets an upgrade! I just love raiding for the bosses, not the loot.
---
If its that awful you ought just start going dungeons.
---
Especially since you're close to soon being able to melee cleave sm library if u wish. Which is great xp/h
---
I wouldn't call pulling something out of thin air a fact, especially since neither he or his senior game developer friend even got the reason for the existence of layers right.
---
But hey, as long we can bash Blizzard for things some people don't even seem to remotely understand everything is alright, isn't it?
---
Can we agree that Tards are the new Tards.
---
T. Previously a huntard, now a warrtard.
---
Way to miss the point. Stats are important sure, and both the hunter and non hunter would benefit from it but while it is mostly just a stat stick for the hunter who'll barely use it for melee (except for the occasional wing clip) the melee class would benefit more from the raw damage output the weapon offers.
---
Likewise, a hunter would be in his right and should get priority to need on a ranged weapon even if said weapon had a useless stat for the hunter. In this case the hunter is mostly focused on the damage output and attack speed of the weapon. The added stats become just a bonus.
---
This is not gonna become the time line we live in. Someone tells chromie to hit that temporal discombulator again. We running this shit back a month.
---
TLDR: Paying for an advantage.
---
‚ÄúPay to win‚Äù essentially means that you can progress further, faster, through a game or win more often or more quickly by spending real-world money on various things relating to a game‚Äôs monetization system.
---
Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
I believe there are statistics about it though. Something like, I happy customer will on average tell two people about it. A very happy customer will tell 5-10 people about it. An unhappy customer will tell 5 people about it. And a very unhapy customer will tell 20-30 people about it.
---
Not directly the numbers but something around this. This is why preventing unhappy customers is always so important. It is not that one customer who is the problem, but that this customer will also cost you another 5-10 potential customers.
---
As someone who loves classic especially pvp and world pvp - layering should go as it completely contradicts the purpose of classics "world and community building" that everyone here enjoys so much.
---
If there is one single thing i would say thats ruined World of warcraft is the endless uses of bloody instances and how much we have been forced into them.
---
Truth is horde and alliance are mostly the same subset of people who have different aesthetic difference. The assholes subset is likely nearly identical on both sides, and we all follow our confirmation bias to assert the other is worse.
---
A lot of people I talked to basically quit soon after reaching 60 because there simply isn't much to do there. Except restarting a different character or farming BiS for no reason.
---
W O R G E N   B A C K W A R D S
---
What? I never reserved anything, I just think needing the Truefaith Vestments if you aren't both a tailor and a priest is a dick move. I wouldn't need the mage or warlock patterns if they dropped.
---
They edited it, genius.
---
but is only a 4 second dot
---
Going to call fake. Say what you want OP, but people make up dumb reasons for karma, and you didn't even put in a small amount of effort with this one.
---
Ain't a rant, it's a lie.
---
I feel like I was dragging through levels in my 30s in particular, but now in my 40s I've got a good pace going on. The chart is a cool XP indicator. I wonder if there's a way to see average time spent at each level range instead.
---
Idk about giving credit, how do you know they didn't only do it because your Reddit post got popular
---
Ancient weapon of the trolls that only a few selected high rank trolls are allowed and able to wield!
---
Vendor: I'll give you about 6g for it.
---
I can imagine. I find that many older players and vanilla-returnees are more likely to play and do dungeons normally, and generally have a more chill attitude. I am sure exceptions exist, but based on those I've encountered (and being one myself) I believe this to be the case. If there are some veteran guilds on your realm, maybe give those a shot!
---
I'd definitely take a composed mage-in-trsining capable of listening, sheeping, switching between single target and AoE as needed than an arrogant, childish jerk who watched some streamers and thinks he's all gold and anything that goes avry is the rest of the group's fault. 
---
Good luck there, hope your wife powers through, and maybe see if you can find some vet guild with (hopefully) some more relaxed people.
---
Fuck, I'm more impressed by having Edgemasters already.
---
Okay but why are you acting like he's bragging about it or acting like he's doing amazing? Warrior tanks at 30 are fucking trash at holding threat and you putting a stupid percentage is shitty gatekeeping.
---
Im telling you mages are the most hated class. Rogues can finally have some rest.
---
yeah heard that too already might give it a try soon :) - but atm I am back at the warri again after I saw some people tank WC on my wl - what is worse then the miss,dodge,parry streaks is wacthing people with absoluetly no clue play tank
---
a lil mage took advantage of me running from mobs last night, 5 deaths later I think he got the message that he was nothing in a 'fair' fight.
---
I mean being almost completely deleted by my savage and then dying immediately after to a moonfire gotta be a bit soul destroying, I mean we were same level too.
---
Here‚Äôs a rough guide for Nelf rep:
---
Do all the 1-6 start area quests
---
In Teldrassil do all the available quests and chains. You should finish there around level 12. Also make sure to pick up the Lady Shatrath quests from Darnassus and at level 10 the breadcrumb quest for sea creatures at the bag vendor at the entry to Darnassus. 
---
Follow any Darkshore guide for all available quests and chains. In particular get Althalaxx because it continues on in Ashenvale for additional rep. Also make sure you collect all sea creature bones on the shore after completing the two qualifying quests on the flight deck at Auberdjne. Also do the dryad escort at Master‚Äôs Glaive. 
---
At around level 19 go south and get the Druid escort that takes you into Ashenvale. At Mathystras Post continue Althalaxx, get Ashenvale quests, do Zoram‚Äôs Strand quests. When you ding 20 get Bathran‚Äôs Hair quest at Mathystra and start this chain also. Follow any Ashenvale guide. Also make sure to do the Vile Satyr and Howling Vale quest chains.
---
From here do the Ashenvale quests in Stonetalon, then return to Ashenvale and continue the chains in this area. 
---
Head to the other continent to level. Repwise there is a breadcrumb in SW at the Park for a turn in at Auberdine and a quest you can do as a follow up in Ashenvale for naga spines from memory. 
---
These are the main early level sections I know. Hope it helps.
---
They said the plan was to gradually remove the number of layers until phase 2, where they will apparently remove them entirely. 
---
Some servers, like Faerlina, will probably never be able to remove layering entirely until the streamers playing there move to a different game, and it‚Äôs not clear whether or not every other server will have to wait for the mega servers to lose population before phase 2 can come out.
---
I just roll on PvE servers. I cannot stand being repeatedly ganked. Sure, it happens. That‚Äôs just Warcraft, but being camped for hours at a time, it gets old and makes me give up. It‚Äôs no fun when you‚Äôre being 1 shotted by a ?? every time you rez.
---
Reaching lvl 60 by now is hardly rushing.
---
Horde: Meatheads, children and occasionally some normal people.
---
Alliance: Weaklinks with personality disorders and god complexes, children and occasionally some normal people.
---
People being so classist to mages. Im a good player - been playing for 13 years played evey class to max level. Im playing a mage in classic after leveling 3 other 60s on private servers. and I feel like I have to be guilty for picking the class because of all the hate from scrubs on this sub
---
r/classicwowscreenshots welcomes you
---
A great trip. Going to try this, currently questing in duskwood and not really enjoying that zone
---
I'm so tired of wiping in BRD because people wanna just pull massive packs and aoe. 
---
Let me as a tank pull those 3 mobs, we kill them fast and still have 80% mana left to continue clearing, instead of mass pulling, nearly wipe and spend 2 min between each pull where either the mage dies, or I have to aoe taunt and either die / shield wall.
---
It might seem slower the way I do it, but believe me it's not. I've done this instance probably 1000 times before.
---
Which early breadcrumb quest faction are you referring to?
---
Nice! I think this belongs to r/dataisbeautiful too
---
id say a healer because they are never particularly gear dependant. if u want to do damage then probably warlock, mage or hunter since they are also the least gear dependant in pvp. rogue is kinda good too, i remember doing alright with my rogue in vanilla that had 2 epics the whole way thru.
---
I got stuck at 38. Took 5 days off already of the grindiest grind.
---
After waiting for years to do meaningful Dungeons again I love that AoEing things away just like in the last 3 retail expansions seems to be the funny way for many.
---
The most fun thing is that this was introduced by the same streamers that whined about RDF dungeon AoE leveling for years.
---
Coherence at its finest.
---
Most companies are like that.
---
My first league account got banned for me playing over-seas (Traveled a lot between EU and US for work) and they didnt give a shit about me trying to reason with them and provide proof.
---
If I had gotten a reddit post to blow up however, they would quickly budge.
---
You have to get lucky on things like that sometimes.
---
I'd say it holds true for the majority of people as long as they are alone. The whole dynamic changes once they are in a group.
---
Alright, I go to sleep now. I just saw the 0/100 bar on him and assumed it must be an energy bar. Have a good night.
---
The mob health addon used to work fine when i was using tidyplates but it stopped working once i switched to neatplates. Anyone knows how to fix this ?
---
This is what i always wanted from blizzard. 
---
Instead they sent us into space to meet weird squid people.
---
!RemindMe 1 Day
---
Calculate the end time - you mana break for 15 seconds but clear 30-40 mobs at once.
---
Yes definitely, it is very good for damage and just an ok healing item. In my regular dungeon group I took the first one as a rogue and the healer took the second drop.
---
I think I gave up when I completed a quest from an npc that says DARNASSUS but when I turned it in I got NO rep. I GUESS I could have been over leveled but I doubt it. I play horde main so it was like the fuckit this isnt worth bothering with right now straw that broke the camel's back. I'm sure that tip works 99% of the time so when I get back at it I will just go through the areas and call it a day. I can always just buy rep at the end with cloth if needed yes?
---
Not taking the bait while you spam downvote me anymore.
---
Do /who. Those players are in your layer. Then remove -z
---
Those players are in different layers.
---
Thank you for explaining!
---
You are aware that people have different tastes, right? No everyone likes stuff like mindlessly grinding reputation ...
---
It's only damage done in the case of Frost shock.
---
What server?
---
No...3 differently colored beasts and a corpse...yeeha
---
I got this same message from the same dude the other night.
---
Im level 46 and im still using ravager. Whats the next upgrade for fury? I want to actually fight to do dps and not spin anymore lol
---
&gt;You guys say the word retard way too much
---
And
---
lololol
---
&gt;Alliance having a fucking spaceship with an orbital cannon but not using it for one.
---
It's an mmo dude, sacrifices have to be made for the sake of gameplay. Rule of cool applies here and I'm not claiming this shit is LOTR, but for the genre I think it's an excellent story.
---
&gt;There are tons and tons of inconsistencies and stupid decisions made by the characters that makes absolutely no sense.
---
Incredibly subjective, everyone handles situations differently. What may be obvious to you might not be obvious to others. Are you aware people make dumbass mistakes in real life?
---
&gt;Voljins death in Legion was a travesty and a real punch in the stomach for horde players.
---
This story arc hasn't even been fully resolved yet, so it's unfair to count this until we find out what is really going on re: death as a force in Azeroth and Sylvanas' role in combating the old gods threat. Also sometimes people fucking die too, I think it's perfectly acceptable to have a character die unexpectedly in a fiction to remind the reader/viewer that the characters are not invincible. Every characters death doesn't have to be a one man reenactment of the Alamo.
---
&gt;Illidan being powerful enough to destroy a naaru and now somehow being able to fight and hold back sargeras with the pantheon, who I remind you were supposed to be dead?
---
Illidan has always been a being of incredible power, he and his demon hunters destroyed many demon planets in the novels. I think that if a band of adventurers can defeat a corrupted naaru in BC Illidan being able to destroy one is perfectly plausible. Also I'd love to hear a source on the pantheon being dead, as prior to legion blizzard never really spoke much with regard to the fate of the pantheon, and there was certainly no definitive conclusion made in universe.
---
It's a video game dude, and an mmo at that. It's incredibly difficult to write a story with 10 million Mary Sue's in it, you have to suspend a certain level of disbelief to enjoy it. There will be inconsistencies, sure, when retconning stuff isn't really as much of an option as it is for other universes (cough 40k cough) shit is bound to get blurred here and there, but compared to other MMO's and even many RPGs wow is on par with if not head and shoulders above a good portion of them in terms of story.
---
You can turn in 60 of each cloth from wool to runecloth, with runecloth becoming repeatable, yes.
---
Christ, no it isn't. This is just stupid.
---
Sometimes guilds will host runs of instances and reserve a specific item because it's all they need from the place. The sole reason they have to run it - and arent willing to lose that to a pug. So if you need that item then dont join their hosted run with organised players.
---
not with mages in your group
---
Man I never see clams while fishing. What time of day do you fish in Tanaris?
---
I don‚Äôt downvote people fyi
---
As a healer I can tell you I use far, far more mana healing these 2h tanks. The extra DPS does not make up for it.
---
The fun part is when those people start the shitfest...but are not allowed to leave when the friends have arrived. :)
---
&gt;he was too busy managing the guild
---
That was my ex-GM's excuse too. He disbanded the guild last week, so I guess he wasted a lot of good leveling time during those 2-3 hours a week he was logged in.
---
Well played
---
I REMEMBER THAT BITCH ON NOSTALRIUS. WHAT SERVER THEY ON
---
I'm a rogue, when I say constant deaths, I'm not talking about myself.
---
Yikes. I‚Äôll just keep playing and not getting upset about how other people play. Quoting urban dictionary is some next level cuteness tho.
---
Yeah super easy.
---
Me too, fire mage bois/grils assemble!
---
The level 20 one isn't really worth it. Far too much traveling for a chest piece that's not super impressive.
---
Lol you completely dismissed my opinion, and when I ask what exactly you find wrong with the retail writing you again dismiss me because you don't have a fucking clue in the world what you're talking about and likely haven't kept up with the retail story whatsoever but just had to hop in on the anti retail circlejerk. Amazing.
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but.. I would just go back to all the 45+ zones and complete questions for gold reward instead of XP. Had a buddy do this and he can‚Äôt stop raving about how much he made effortlessly
---
I started off with a 3 month. I knew what I wanted this second time around having never played vanilla before.
---
Whats stopping anyone doing that anyway? Reservation is an honest act
---
Glad to hear that, man! :D
---
Force yourself to do other hobbies or you‚Äôll regret it later. I love WoW, but man it is SO important that you don‚Äôt slack off with things that really matter. Hope you can manage to do both!
---
I play on a server 3 hours ahead (so 11pm my time is 2am server time) and I thought that would help but early 30‚Äôs is a slog. I‚Äôm running into deathsquads. It‚Äôs fun but holy shit these people love killing lowbies.
---
50% gone? are u braindead?
---
my server STILL has a 100-150 min queue.
---
if you really think think classic only has 5% of its playerbase left after 2 months u should come back to reality 
---
EVERY german server is at HIGH or FULL
---
Just read the original post after seeing this.
---
Thanks for linking. I also found the defaults that the addon comes with amusing. Like it automatically on installation filters out all Thunderfury and [Anal] links. You can tell the things the addon creator didn‚Äôt like quite easily haha
---
Ah so it's getting the circlejerk ready for something 99% of us haven't even noticed negative effects from.
---
&gt; So now I have titan bar to monitor happiness
---
Could you share the link please ? I can't seem to find a pet happiness plugin for my titan bar.
---
I thought the exact same thing. This game never ceases to amaze me with it's secrets.
---
Congrats on 60! You made it üëç
---
15 weapon damage is nothing compared to 5% crit, especially as arms.
---
I have a 41 lock with enchanting and tailoring, but I don't know how experienced that makes me.
---
Personally I've DE'd all of the greens I have or made if they aren't an upgrade, I haven't had any money problems except for when I re-specced. Other classes need to save money for the mounts at LVL 40 but since warlocks get it for free, that's 100g that you "don't need" 
---
Obviously you still need to buy skills and pet skills, but you probably don't need or use all of them? So you can save money there, and if you don't have tailoring, you can make all that cloth that drops from humanoids into bandages, linen and wool make you lose a few copper per bandage when sold to a vendor, but once you get to silk, bandages sell for 2 silver, while regular cloth sells for 1.5 silver, it's not much, but you get a lot of cloth while questing.
---
Personally I wouldn't worry about selling the greens unless you really need the money, because if you don't disenchant them, Then on later lvls you need to grind greens to get the materials, or you have to buy them off the auction house, which can be really expensive or time consuming.
---
TLDR: Don't worry about it, warlocks have a free mount at 40, you don't need any money but for skills, you'll get that easy by questing.
---
I'm french and have never seen this word.
---
Back in legion I talked about coffee with a GM and how much we both drank at work, after my issue was fixed he actually gifted me the Digital Legion CE, was really surprised!
---
Light's hope chapel will be a complete mess.
---
I  oticed rhis around lvlv 15 for 42 gold. Couldn't sell it thou.
---
Thanks for the pointers!
---
Oh wow... I've seen so many people being excited when they dinged 30 "yey, half way through"... And then you see this and realize: nope, more like 13%
---
My original plan was to git gud but that failed lol. 
---
Honestly I would have went pve but my two brothers and I were all gonna play classic together and they chose a pvp realm. Now they both no-lifed it to 60 and I‚Äôm stuck crying in the strangelthorn mud with 72 hours on the character and no willingness to start over
---
During vanilla there were several exploits with people staying out of combat during boss fights in raids and ressing the dead. As a side effect of the fixes for this is that you will almost immediately be put into combat again after vanishing.
---
The only way to survive is to be the last player alive and then vanish.
---
Blizzard stated that /who doesn't work that way. You get a different result to your search query. But it still doesn't tell you anything about the layer.
---
bows are your bread and butter until crossbows
---
MOM BATHROOM!
---
And then spend 5 days downloading the video on your shitty dial-up internet.
---
Honor system and no BGs - the best pvp days if you ask me.
---
DTF the slave girl in the background (in game.. of course)
---
I'd rather they do TBC+. Then we'd have Horde Paladins/Alliance Shamans, Jewelcrafting, better class/spec viability, and the best feature of all, Karazahn.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read as well. Was talking with a buddy about this today and it‚Äôs pretty obvious that this is entirely too low of a decay rate. Something like 1g of decay per day would be a lot more reasonable but still probably accomplish the same goal of disencentivizing constant respeccing
---
If census wasnt killed off we could do a decent approximation
---
The level 10 breadcrumb quest is Night Elf only so a human can't pick it up.
---
I don't think so, whenever I've been in contact with a GM it's always been a really nice experience, except for one time where I later created a ticket regarding that I had been poorly treated and thus recieved an apology and a month of free game time. Blizzard just seems to be pretty cool about these things.
---
Needs more horde
---
Where did the gaming laptop touch you?
---
If you're looking for the basic Clam Meat, the best place horde side is the murlocs on the lake shore just south of UC.
---
You can buy membership on retail wow but not classic. The game can either be played solo or with friends, really preference but end game content and dungeons have to be played with others. Cannot be solo‚Äôd.
---
What are these "dots" you speak of ?
---
I only know Shadowbolt and Corruption
---
Ah i didnt know that. I just released after the boat arrived in ratchet since theres a gy there anyway
---
&gt; something was on a forum on the internet and some people saw it" doesn't cause multi billion dollar companies to jump to action.
---
Reddit is the 6th most popular website in the US, and 19th in the world. It‚Äôs not small. It‚Äôs literally just behind Facebook in the US rankings.
---
Says the guy bitching about water and how nobody loves him boo hoo
---
Health regenerates faster than mana, just explain to your healer that health and mana are the same for lock and there's no need healing you to full health.
---
Where are you moving to and from
---
Sylvanas uses valkyr to raise forsaken. Those we see and play are the remnants of lordaeron which broke free from arthas/the scourge control when he was weakened during the events of wc3 TFT or newly raised later from the population of those that died there. 
---
There were some quest that implied that sylvanas valkyr can only raise humans (and vrykul... In cata silverpines I think, where a outpost is attacked by only non-humans and some undead then makes fun of them being afraid to send humans because they'd be raised as forsaken).
---
Sylvanas herself is an exception as she is less the body we see but rather a banshee, so a tormented ghost that was raised by arthas himself just to spite her, as she was frankly annoying as ranger general when he tried to roll through silvermoon to get to the sunwell... Until she in a moment of tactical brilliance in her final battle decided to powerslide right into frostmourne and go the way of all melee hunters. As banshee after she broke free lateron she then "possessed" her own dead body and decided to stick with that.
---
In BfA they threw the whole human/vrykul only thing over board again with delaryn and sira, which are nightelves that were raised against their will but for some reason instantly do a full 180 and suddenly condemn the nightelves and elune and are like absolutely convinced of the idea of now being dead and slaughtering their former friends because "death changes you"... But they also aren't mind controlled. No idea where that plot went at this point. 
---
Reason why we don't see other undead races is probably less a lore thing. Blizz either didn't bother with creating models for all of them, or didn't want to open the discussion of people then wanting to play as them and either create a separate undead-subrace for each race or make the general undeads completely overplayed if they add pretty much all races as rotten version as customization option for them.
---
I could never get into it, felt like WoW to me just in a star wars costume. Heard great things about it tho.
---
Don't forget to check Darnassus periodically after level 30, there are the Moonkin investigation quests you get from the house in Ruttheran village.
---
And Feralas is also worth mentioning.
---
Appreciate the information but more interested in clams from fishing, looking for pearls mostly. Clams that can be acquired without having to fight would be amazing (:
---
I'm still waiting for the first warlock/mage tank. "I can hold aggro much easier then regular tanks". I just hope nobody finds the tanking/pvp cloth set that drops from the d 0,5 questline.
---
Double check your gpu drivers are updated. If they are, just monkey with the in-game setting to make sure everything is optimized for your system. Does this happen with any other game or just WoW classic?
---
Not to sure since I remember it happening to us too, but as a healer I would pop renews and eat on the safe spots.
---
I will Try this. Have completely Skipped feralas for eg
---
Shoutout to the level 52 that gave me a free 16 slot bag when I made my first character on Grob, you the real MVP
---
If you read it again you can see i didn't say you do this :)
---
In recent I have seen too many people start to demand something just because they didn't get it in first few runs so i just ask you to not fall to this toxic loop of reserving something in pub groups. Wish you good luck to get your pattern soon.
---
I see where you're coming from, but I disagree with you. A tank that isn't taking damage for the team is no tank at all.
---
When you say I shouldn't call out damage dealers based on DPS at low level, you're right, I shouldn't and I don't. But I DO call out DPS based on relative damage done. If one DPS is doing 5% of the party's damage... they're not pulling their weight, and they need to pull up their socks and do their job.
---
Lol I just now realized that was their intention with azerite.....What a horrible, horrible execution.
---
What addon did u use for the combo points? Or is it a WeakAura?
---
if you are talking about max level? demo/destruction is ds/ruin and you sacrifice your succubus to get 15% more shadow damage.
---
for leveling i'd recommend going drain tank with heav affliction dark pact. you use a succubus to deal autoattack damage and you steal its mana. imp is ok too but don't go dark pact since imps go oom so quick.
---
sm/ruin late game is the imp spec, you want at least 1 lock in the raid in the tank group with sm/ruin to give the tank blood pact.
---
I already strayed from this path, and specced for single target frost dps.  Shatter combos give sweeet damn crits!
---
Eh, sometimes people that shouldn't be competition end up being competition. Only way you can make sure no one rolls on weapons, or melee leather/mail dps stuff is to invite 4 casters which can be a bit of a chore.
---
Pools around the south end, below grom'gol. Both east and west sides, they spawn more often at night
---
That CC was most likely not owned by the thief (hence why he didn‚Äôt remove it), so chances are that some other victim payed for that account :(
---
Cheers I just checked üëç
---
My honest suggestion - instance grind. Avoid STV/Hillasbrad. 
---
This also may be nuts, but a /wave can‚Äôt hurt.. maybe they will leave you alone.
---
My buddy is in his 30s is experiencing the same thing, I no life‚Äôd it a bit and it seems the people in the 30-40 range now, would rather gank than level!
---
Thats nice, i've noticed several: 
---
1- Friend getting ganked on top of me but on another layer.
---
 2- Camping a quest mob deep in a dungeon when a group of 5 guys phased in from another layer cause it was too camped 
---
3- Alot of time trading in org/UC i have to inv them to party and wait rather than just finding them in the spot they say they are. 4- Theres no way it hasnt led to increased resources being farmed, how much is hard to say but definately some amount
---
The only one who got the reference.
---
dae mages bad
---
Ret does really rely on weapon top-end damage for command procs.
---
&gt; this is simply a funfact type of thing
---
So him saying its not useful seems quite accurate
---
Just started talking to my old buddies today I just started back playing yesterday. 
---
Oh yea... it's all coming together
---
Sounds stressful if you got a really rare pet lol. Emergency comes up mid fight you have to run, o shit.
---
Make an alt and wait for the casual player base to hit 60. (Not to sound rude or anything!)
---
Thanks for the reply, also how are the quests in this game? I know I know, asking about quests in an MMO, but I actually really enjoy funny dialogue or interesting story and every time I see a streamer do quests they usually just don't read it and accept it, is this just because they know the story so to speak or because they don't care about the story and want to grind or is the story just not as developed in classic?
---
You can‚Äôt find groups as a warrior tank? Now I really don‚Äôt believe you.
---
Yeah man I heard you get 2-4g as reward and add in a green item that vendors for 1-3g your making an easy 5-7g a quest!
---
Finally someone who isn't a whiny bitch.
---
I think if someone is not going to resub they might not been enjoying and have quit already. Huge majority is still on journey to 60. I bet a lot of those people will keep playing at least until they are 60. I don't think we are going to see any huge drop in active players (aka queue times) soon. Of course I might be wrong.
---
I did buy 6 month game time good while ago so I'm set until something like January or February.
---
Not only that, but if you quest in silverpines prior you really get "sense of world" you can feel this Arugal's presence all around, taking him down for the first time was an amazing experience!
---
I am tanking, primarily in defensive stance start in battle charge shout to burn charge rage (dont have anger management so dont retain rage when changing stances) switch to def then mostly just spam tab sunder and revenge whenever I can once I get 3 sunders on the mobs (however many there might be) I start incorporating bloodthirst rather than heroic strike so not too far different from standard tank rotation just I pump out more white damage therefore a shitload more threat
---
Still seems too endearing. Like you help them and they still get credit but you have to pretend you still hate them because that's what's expected of you. Instead you have to help til the very end of the quest then gank them right as they're about to complete it
---
Nice weapon bro !
---
What kind of pearls?
---
welcome to 2006
---
Westfall alliance has a non-shitty economy, people actually run dungeons in pugs and most are proficient, and it's always high but not full after 6pm.
---
i just think it's wild that you believe that since no one has been banned for griefing quest npcs, it's normal behavior. 
---
i could see why you'd thing killing it once or a few times would be funny, but you said you were there for *hours*.. in a low level zone.. getting a kick out of denying noobs the ability to progress in the game.
---
He had another account. This is why Angwe Spy and Angwe could be online at the same time.
---
One thing I did not consider in my original post is that drain life uses mana while soul link mitigation does not - so the difference is even greater. I'll change to soul link at level 45 and see how it goes. Thank you for the replies.
---
Stealth classes are the most fun in AV in my experience. Capable of all kinds of shenanigans if you're creative.
---
Dungeons or just grind. In my experience Desolace is where the people who don't want the PvP fuckfest of stranglethorn go so they are more passive, and the basilisks around the place are decent to grind on for money for mount. That or run dungeons, you're a warrior so you can get a group easily as a tank.
---
Alright thanks guys I'll try getting it for a month and seeing how it goes, as soon as I saw Troll as one of the playable races and their dance I felt like I cant not try it at least for a month
---
Could you post your talent spec? And is it just spam lightening bolts? I'm about this level and on the fence of going ele to level
---
Cleave addicts. Lets just call em what they are.
---
Blizzard needs to set up support groups - Cleavers Anonymous.
---
Not only that, but the pet's loyalty isnt going down if it is dead. You would have to kill the pet twice to reduce happiness, then somehow cc the hunter for 20 hours straight for the loyalty to go down and the pet to run away.
---
I have a friend who has issues and lots of bright stuff triggers her problems where she can‚Äôt talk or stutters,etc loses balance due to an injury. Is there a way to turn spell effects down? Wow is pretty calm and she is interested. Just wondered what you guys think
---
Are you a lvl 55 troll with edgemasters handguards?
---
This is a valid opinion but very specific to your expierence. 
---
I do agree to some extent, I have seen retail wow mentalities in classic. Mainly in dungeons with AOE pulls, no CC etc. However, I have had very few very few people just leave a dungeon or not go the extra mile to help.
---
I think it depends on your level range right now tbh. I think people 45+ are much more committed to the classic life style and people 35 and lower and still in a more casual mindset and still may play BFA. (Just a thought based on what I have heard from a few friends still in the late 20s and early 30s) 
---
However I can report nothing but good vibes from kirtonos horde over here!
---
Because he enjoyed himself ?
---
I expect that you are already lvl60 which used guides or autopilot addon and you have no idea how painful leveling now can be with dozens people occuping every spawn spot for quest mobs. In this light i can understand why he picked "slower" progress by running dungeons.
---
def a buyers market right now
---
Congratulations. 
---
You know watching the classic posts after launch there is a few places where we as a player have changed quite alot since vanilla. One of the areas is the persistence to grind after that one goal. I see posts like this, or where people have grinded for special mounts, low level gear sets etc. Its not that people didnt grind in vanilla, but in my opinion this clear focus was not as prevalent in Vanilla. 
---
In Retail this is common place, grinding for the special mounts, gear and other achivements.
---
You can only taunt them if the pet doesnt have it on passive. I love that private server warriors cant pull this shit on me, anymore.
---
He was for real. The PIN is 9133. Get that free money everyone.
---
To me it doesn't feel like it, I would definitely say that I was addicted to other games in the past. 
---
The difference to me is that I care for my career and family first and play in my free time. I spend a few hours each day on video games for pretty much as long as I can remember. but now I treat it differently  as described in the post. 
---
so as it doesn't make me turn my back on real life duties I at least would it classify it as a harmful addiction. 
---
thanks for your comment
---
To be fair, your number 2 would still be an issue without layering and number 4 is just a result of increased amount of players. Blizz made the timer on layer hopping to gather mats equal to/worse than just staying on your layer and farming so the increase in resources being farmed is just a result of more farmers.
---
It only works if the pet is on defensive or aggressive. A passive pet cant be taunted.
---
Your just a judgmental mother fucker aren't you.
---
Jealousy is unbecoming my friend
---
Just dinged 40. This was not what I wanted to see.
---
Well that's something to look forward to...although getting to 45 is going to take me aaaages XD
---
def. a slow leveller here
---
At first I thought I could escape but then the warrior charge hit me hard hahahaha
---
Next level rogue trolling. Bad person, yes. but in a funny way.
---
Whenever I see a lower level horde just going about their questing I leave them alone, only go after other devilsaur farmers.  Most of them are probably the same way.
---
&gt;Yup. You called BFAs story compelling. Your opinion is worthless. 
---
Lol alright man have a good night.
---
Only good hordie is a dead hoodie. Also I steal chests all the time, do it for the lulz.
---
Nice, 6g toward an epic mount
---
Should still use freeze trap, because you cant taunt passive pets in classic. This was something private servers got wrong. I would use immo trap on them when i was playwd on one as well, because the ticks woulf also trigger entapment (only initial tick does in classic, the only one that pulses is frost now)
---
Ah.. i see what you did there.=)
---
Use it if the mob will die before you can cast a frostbolt assuming that the mob isn't immune to fire.
---
Same on Mograine
---
The last farmstead the Defias hadn't taken yet
---
All I can say is read up on it **https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2375**
---
Its stupid is what it is, but alas I don't really care.
---
what do you hope to gain from typing this crap lmao, let people do what they enjoy
---
So I have a 60 shadow priest atm and am debating on making a warrior or rogue alt (possibly high level twink) Are these the only two viable options for a  melee class? If doing mostly PVP would a Druid be good at 39/49 BGS? 
---
My plans from day one are runecloth bags, enchants, and gear/high quality consumables for everything.
---
Razorgore here pretty much 80% of the people I meet are top notch gentlemen.
---
Dont be a bitch and play through it
---
Or be a bitch and run along the sides so they dont see u
---
I'm in blameaux because it sounds like blow me.  
---
Thanks for having me on.
---
That's from dungeon running with other mages. 100k is from LBRS but its good exp regardless of the dungeon, just round up as many as you can then burst them down while rotating frost novas to keep the pack snared. I haven't done any solo AOE due to the very reason you described.
---
Not a healthy idea. You want to encourage everyone to be 60 and have no one leveling or doing early game content anymore? Personally, one of the best parts of vanilla was that there are always people of all levels doing all sorts of content. If I had an alt theres still be plenty of others ready for deadmines. Obviously knowledge and mindset has changed but getting everyone to 60 right away isnt the goal. They arent planning on rushing everyone through the content
---
To be fair. The aquatic form quest sucks ass balls and most people wait to 60 to do it.
---
 !RemindMe 1 day
---
I've played both horde and alliance on both PvP and PvE servers through the years and I've noticed that it's really only the horde that gets all uptight about "loyalty." Alliance routinely has conversations about their horde toons, they're favorite horde starting zones, or what server they play horde on (in the case of PvP). Hell, I was even in an Alliance guild on a PvP server that had a clone Horde guild on another PvP server where everyone played their Horde toons. 
---
Meanwhile if you mention you have an alliance alt to the horde they're ready to flay you and start calling you slurs.
---
That 2004 community is gone. In the infamous words of Garrosh Hellscream: "Times change." Youll only be able to play Vanilla wow if you manage to invent a Time Machine. Vanilla is never coming back. But we do have Classic and once you can Seperate Vanilla from Classic can you enjoy it for what is it. and thats the unfortunate reality we live with but man I say the fact we have classic makes things okay.
---
You do have a bunch of High Elves forsaken but that's not shown in classic. 
---
There  wouldn't have any of the Horde races who all fled to Kalimdor before the whole Arthas debacle. Now I'll assume that it is possible that a handful of unlucky trolls living between Lordearon and Quelthalas found themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time and thus were assimilated in the army of the dead.
---
Yep. I saved a horde shaman who was low HP ONE time. Not even 10 minutes later 3 horde roll by ganking me and there he is. Never again.
---
I noticed this difference also. When i entered The Barrens, i was expecting a complete shitstorm in the general chat. Instead, we had "philosophical" conversations.
---
IT WAS SO STRANGE.

I never said i went into it with vanilla mentality from back in the day. I compared pserver communities with how it is now and I can only say how it is on the server i play on. Might be different on other servers. Also, you have no idea what effort i've put in on trying to find like-minded people like myself. I prefer pve servers so yeah i have not looked into the pvp servers that much, maybe it's better there.  
---
Also it still does not remove the fact of the power-levelling and gold buying that i have openely seen and Blizzard totally ignoring. I expected to not see that stuff on classic-wow tbh.
---
It is easy to tell who hasnt pvpd much in classic. Cant wait for some warrior to just run face first into my trap thinking he can taunt my passive pet to get out of it.
---
That's disgusting, people take this game far too extreme. Sorry that happened to you, guess we all have to start asking if things are reserved on advance now, it's not the way the game should be played.
---
thanks im gonna sleep well tonight.... maybe
---
nice video but I never played as a troll
---
Nice, horde as well. Been playing with my two buddies usually for a few hours a night from 7-10pm, sometimes earlier sometimes later. Only 38 right now, but getting there. Feel free to hit me up if you ever wanna do dungeons or quest, or just wanna cause a bit of ruckus haha. 
---
Character's name is Vertrik.
---
Keep health and mana high + cooldowns and consumables ready. When you first visit a contested zone with enemy presence I expect a stack of invis potions and grenades. Situational awareness, think about ganking enemies first before they do this to you. If they gang up on you gang back. Yes you get less exp in a group but more then while being dead. Also keep alternatives like dungeons or other zones/quests in mind.
---
The beginning still creeps me out, sheesh.
---
Doesn't just an auto swing cancel the cast of hearthstone. I didn't think it needed to be kicked.
---
I've personally encountered 5 ppl openly saying it to me in-game on my server. I guess they are not the only ones that have done it.
---
Eh.  It's more like 30-33%.  I tend to think of L30 as 1/3 of the way there and L40 as nearly half way.
---
Can I has link to your WA?
---
I hate all spiders. They sound annoying, they walk funny and they rarely drop anything of value.
---
Lol sounds like you're mad at others being able to play the game more... for whatever reason.
---
BoooOOooooOOoooo
---
&gt;  230 dmg over 30 seconds isn‚Äôt toogrea 
---
but the proc refresh your Rend time on target which i find quite useful tbh
---
^ what he said
---
Enjoy the server merges, stjohcaukb.
---
Me2 :(
---
Pretty much anything that runs away
---
I became lvl 60 1,5 weeks after launch. I was a head of the curve by miles on the server i played on.
---
tanking pugs without taunt? oh God the horror Oo
---
Careful, this is very unpopular opinion. Most people think that pserver community is toxic and ruins classic for BfA players. If should I objectively tell my experience tho, most people here are quite nice and its similar to pservers, however It came to my attention that the attitude running dungeons has changed a lot. Whenever I made a group for dungeon on pserver, people stick together until the shit was done. This is not the case here. People joins the group just to leave in 5minutes without saying anything. It sometimes takes me up to 7-9invites to make a 5man group. Leaving group also occurs more frequently after wipes. I guess some mentality made from BfA is hard to change. Im still talking about the minority here, even though my ignore list is getting fuller quite faster than ever
---
The spiderwing in naxxramas heard you and cried a Little!
---
Been playing with fury 2h and thinking of picking this up because of the speed
---
Whenever I swapped I had to call a number and listen to machine tell me a long stribg of numbers and letter or whatever.
---
I see many people that have buffs and rebuffs pop up over their head when it gets applied or is lost. Is this an add on or can I turn this on with regular setting? If it is an add on could I get the name please
---
It's been slow and tedious at times, but overall I've had a great experience. Just hit 60 after averaging maybe 5 hours of play per day, so for the upcoming month I'll probably chill my shit and only log on to raid and do a dungeon here and there.
---
Sounds like a you problem and not anybody elses lol.
---
I wonder what they were classes before the plague.
---
Turtles, absurd amount of armor and hp, really wears on you when a same level mob still yoinks 60% of ur hp.
---
Other than that any mobs with instant cast abilities that hit hard.
---
That‚Äôs interesting! That sucks you ran into a non helping community!
---
Yea because people with jobs and families can't ever have time for hobbies. 
---
Welcome o 2019 grandpa, it's a new world.
---
Damn if only I was on that realm. Thanks mate, very kind of you.
---
Buncha whiny bitches in the WoW community. Sitting at home in their mommys house and nothing ever goes right for tem dammit! Leveling is gonna be HELL
---
This makes me want to spit on any warrior i see in town, hoping one of them will taunt my pet, thinking ill get owned by the guards lol
---
Thinking some valid worries = being a whiny bitch. Itll be fun at first but be hell to do anything, especially level, once you've decided you want to do something other than pvp
---
Since when was pserver community 2004?
---
The trick is to not make everything irrelevant.
---
Instead of replacing literally all your gear every time by giving out a new tier every raid, let's make one new raid give you the best sword sword, and the next one gives you the best leggings.
---
its even good on warriors at the low levels
---
You got triggered because I pointed out someone calling other tanks bad while saying they can do the job with just mashing 1 button.
---
Then you either look at my post history and try to call me out for bitching about holding threat, saying I should use a skill I don't have before trying to backtrack it...  Or you just like to make shit up at random since I mentioned nothing about aggro.  
---
Not sure which is more pathetic to be honest.
---
They do hear it.
---
I use alts in classic to boost my main. Professions and bank space are a godsend.
---
Because we are under no obligation to give you shit for free. I'm not gonna take 2 minutes to conjure water and then drink to get my mana back for every random who asks me for water without some compensation. Dont like it? Find a mage who will do it for free or go pay full price at a vendor
---
Classic is also with the 1.12 talents which are much improved, plus the gear is better there was no +spell/healing for instance, and I am pretty sure MP5  gear was nonexistent aswell. 
---
So we basically have the game right before TBC, where both MC/ony have been nerfed + stronger gear/talents.
---
Back in vanilla if I remember correctly a shadow priest tanked and killed ony with just two other players with him druid healer and a holy priest when the game was around this stage.
---
I disagree. He didn't do you any harm and he was Grey to you. It was an honorless kill.
---
Lol you fool
---
Two days ago I got the message that my sub runs out in 30 minutes in the middle of SM graveyard. We finish the dungeon in like 5-10 minutes and I get kicked on the way out of the dungeon. So those 30 minutes were a lie...
---
Yes, but the chance of rolling 100 after you've rolled a 100 is still 1/100 because rolls are independent from each other and thus irrelevant.
---
Thats only in raids (and there might even be a few rare feral spots). During the leveling and non raids at 60, feral is great and tanks for dungeons are always wanted.
---
May not be enough for some, but a lot of more casual players will get a long time of fun out of that.
---
So basically you aren't whining you just want to level on a pve server and then pvp on a pvp server. I think retail might interest you...
---
Did scholo with a shaman tank the other day. Went surprisingly well.
---
Friend of mine was Herb/Skin.  He made quite a bit from gathering.  Though, our raiding guild was also a collection of a lot of people farming constantly to provide mats for guild progression, so most of us were gatherers, and we had a few people with production type stuff such as alch, BS, Enchant.  Benefit to this was, since we all gave in, most of the pots and enchants would end up being freely handed out.  It wasn't uncommon to be handed elixirs and other pots during the beginning of a raid, or if I got a piece of equipment, I'd get a whisper right away "What enchant you want?" and get it done while pulling trash.
---
Would you post your talent tree please?
---
Just today on my server I did Uldaman with a pally who only blessed himself with might and did not use an aura
---
Meanwhile rogue is kicking healing totems but not healing wave or shadow bolt volley.
---
When I have 9 interrupts on important abilities and I am the one knocking down totems with HoJ while healing and the rogue has 7 interrupts on dumb shit and never killed a totem but demands I give him might instead of salv and he doesn't watch aggro...
---
There are truly some idiotic motherfuckers out there
---
This just sounds like a jelly rogue who can't find a group because of spellcleave.
---
Weapon chain, yo.
---
Deleted doesn't mean what you think it does.
---
Lord know he'll need it
---
The Venture Company, they run fast and still have a decent amount of health when they do.
---
Well you are on a Wow Classic sub reddit so obviously most comments here will tell you to go for it. 
---
Word of caution though, this game is a huge time sink. The sense of progression you get what by levelling or by simply getting an upgrade is real making the game all the more addictive.
---
The axe is .2 faster than the scepter, has a worse proc, and is a level lower. I did not take axe spec because I didn't want to be pigeon-holed while leveling, although I realize now I probably should have if purely for Ravager.
---
It is a matter of perspective. Classes are not remotely balanced in terms of gold/hour metrics, they never have been. AoE grinding is king, pet classes are solo gods, stealth classes can get away with crazy runs, tanks and healers are screwed. You can call that asymmetric balance if you want.
---
depends on when you usually play. If you are like me and often play around 3am you are fucked. If you are a typical user and playing around 4pm-10pm you should be fine.
---
I don‚Äôt get the spellcleave hate on this sub. You had one bad group and you want three classes to stop doing something they like doing? I personally find it more fun than the regular frost bolt spam and I‚Äôm not always finding decent groups for it so I still do plenty of regular runs no problem. On Fairbanks at least there isn‚Äôt any problems with regular groups or the presence of spellcleave groups.
---
Having 10g in classic*
---
i agree, but don't get why they call it honor :P
---
Free game time! Wonder if I can report myself!
---
I flipped out on a dude when this happened to me. I felt like such a dummy when they explained that I needed to use the horn
---
Man I just sat there feeling like a dick
---
I was playing around with a Demon Hunter for a bit, not quite sold on it just yet. Oh well, I'll have to wait and re-evaluate in a few weeks before my sub re-ups.
---
this will be my frist month of wow sub ever when it is active and i do not log in to current retail  
---
i hope stats will show many people like me and ring a bell  
---
their writing has gone to shit, people still prefer the 15yo dated looks and clunky everything over their current timeline of "THIS ISNT THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF ME BISH" \*wooosh into the sky as black good\* villains
---
Zandalar Tribe represent
---
I have actually checked all EU pve servers and i decided to give one of them my full attention and i levelled up to 60 on one of them. I cba to do that on all 3 pve servers just to see how it is on lvl 60. I have however lvl 20 characters on the other pve servers and I've seen the LFG and general channels and can tell that the community is the same there as it is on the server i decided to focus on.
---
And about power-levelling and gold buying. yes it has always been there but Blizzard has stated that they have a very good system in place to stop this from happening. So far i have yet to see this "amazing" system. and yes it does affect me because these power-level companies roll on everything they can get a hold off to make that additional gold. So it does indeed inpact my gaming experience. I'm not forced to play with him as you say and i have put them on ignore when i notice it's a power-levelling character. But no-one can predict it's a power-levelling character until you're in a group with one.
---
Do you have a link to this build? Also ty for the help!
---
Shamans are good healers and their totems provide insane utility. Also the mana tide totem is very useful. It is like an group innervate.
---
you're
---
yes, me too
---
and this is forbidden?
---
2 mins into the dungeon
---
"Give me a couple mins guys, I need to pack a bowl"
---
If ur getting corpse camped, just log onto your alt for an hour :)
---
I think Orc wins in a DPS contest? Weapon +5 is useful vs bosses, and they have a decent active as well.
---
Amazing news flash, it is possible to set up macros to switch gear as you stance dance bringing the best of both worlds....lol
---
isnt all pallies do is auto attack?
---
I'm not offering a solution to every rogues problems with mages.  
---
Just stating what I usually do. It does not always work for me as well. There are too many variables to cover each situation.  
---
I'd suggest you reasearh mage talents/spells/skills. Maybe even play one.
---
Cool bro, have fun
---
Yes, anyone who wants to be taken seriously as a mage needs to work towards the archmage robe.
---
As mage u have plenty of other options for gold farming without a specific profession, so 2nd profession could be whatever you want.
---
got a question about the AH.. so when someone buysout my item i always get my extra gold for my deposit or whatever but this time how come they took a small cut?
---
I didn't specify which part of his statement was factual, but there are indeed many fact, wow related or not, in what he said.
---
Is he right? Did I say he was? No. Im just agreeing that his speculation is plausible because it based on factual and technical understanding. Not just some crying "you're wrong because stuff!"
---
Made me lol

/r/classicwowbestwow

get heart of the wild in feral and nature's swiftness in resto, the rest is pretty flexible
---
You are assuming that those that are rightfully banned wouldn‚Äôt also be appealing. When a big ban goes into effect CS will expect a certain amount of appeals. Plus it‚Äôs CS - they have a certain amount of time they should be dedicating per case, with more serious cases being okay to spend extra time on. However, in a case of a huge exploit-related ban CS won‚Äôt delve super deep into each and every account - they‚Äôre 100% expecting whining from those who were guilty, and have a checklist to follow to deal with those people. It‚Äôs reasonable to assume here that CS doesn‚Äôt have access to a spreadsheet of every single thing an account has done. They would see it as: an algorithm flagged them as guilty, they receive an appeal(s) as expected, follow their check list, move on if nothing jumps out as out of the ordinary off the bat.
---
Once there is a higher than expected number of appeals, a supervisor would alert the manager, who would then elevate the issues further up the chain on command where the issue will be dealt with, decisions made, etc. In cases where an issue is already known but the solution is either in the works or has not been implemented yet CS could also be advised to blanket-deny all appeals as it‚Äôll now be dealt with on a larger scale.
---
I hope you kid, but a company with millions upon millions of active monthly users won‚Äôt have a person sitting there just waiting for you specifically to submit a ticket, so they can now finally have something to do. It‚Äôs a standard CS system applied to a game company.
---
Let‚Äôs hope she does sth interesting instead of becoming a raid boss 
---
Comics Tell is the void hates her guts (which is a good thing obviously) 
---
Maybe she‚Äôll do sth about nzoth with that death guy she was talking about
---
I'd personally recommend mining. Not a lot of people are leveling mining very high since you have to manually grind it instead of passively leveling like herbalism and skinning.
---
There are no dailies to keep up with, so once you're happy with your gear on your main, alts can help with professions and such and won't have hundreds of dailies to catch up
---
so 46 or 47 is half?
---
Ah the men in the High tower living detached. I member this.
---
Why is that the alternative? Where was this stated? Or are you just assuming?
---
Ok, I didn't 100% remember how SoC worked in classic. I just remembered that you didn't have any instant weapon damage+X attacks.
---
There are 2 kinds of people playing wow...
---
warriors have mortal strike. you want high weapon damage so that your ms' hit hard. also makes your slams stronger. slow weapons have higher raw weapon damage than fast weapons.
---
True actually!
---
What you want to wear it made by someone else!?
---
And once the exodus eventually leads to a more reasonable population, why do you assume the server would continue to lose players till its dead... 5k people leave Herod then bam you have a sustainable high pop just like any other, without bullshit layers.  Besides, there's probably only a handful of servers with "days long queues" anyways. Think youre being a bit dramatic. You swear like there werent thriving private servers with crowded zones. People loved that shit.
---
/fart emote, everywhere
---
Yeah let's all be aware of the private chat channel full of meta aids that nobody used in classic days weeeee
---
Those people took vacation time. I dunno how it is for you, but I have 28 days of paid vacation per year. My sister gets about 50-90 days off per year.
---
Thats now how statistics works. rolling the same # twice is exponentially higher odds. As in getting heads once is 50%, heads twice is 25%. so 1/100, then 2nd 100 roll is 1/10,000.
---
Sie sind das Essen und Wir sind die Jaeger!
---
Dark pact doesn't scale with damage because it doesn't deal damage.  Life tap scales.
---
I have never heard of this. Do you have any source to back this up ? Pets die super easily in raids.
---
Not sure il resub. Ive been trying to like it, would have loved to play the original Naxx but the classes as so boring and slow. Doesnt help that the friends i was going to level with quit too.
---
The miss chance formula is:
---
* 5% + (def skill - weapon skill) * 0.2%, when the difference is bigger than 10.
---
* 5% + (def skill - weapon skill) * 0.1%, when the difference is 10 or less.
---
So, at 315 def (lvl 63 mob or boss) and 300 wepaon skill, you have an 8% chance to miss without any hit%. However when the difference is bigger than 10, the first hit% is also ignored, putting your hitcap at 9%.
---
When it's 315 def vs 305 weapon skill, you have 6% miss chance and the first hit% is not ignored, so your hitcap is 6%.
---
White hits while dual-wielding have an additional 15% miss chance.
---
The key breakpoints for weapon skill are 305 and 308. When reaching 305, you change to the more favorable formula, which is a massive bonus. 308 is the cap for glancing blow damage.
---
If it were me I would just get to 60 ignore best in slot and get an almost as good chest and then run mc etc. Then again 100 enchanting is pretty low and you haven't committed to much into it so a switch wouldn't be that costly. But the mats required to level tailoring is staggering. So basically it would be faster and cheaper to skip tailoring and dungeon grind and raid. But you might not have the absolute best chest haha.
---
Almost everything you wrote is my experience too. Except on the server i decied to focus on it's not a minority.
---
Tailoring and Engineering.
---
Go farm for gold, you're a mage.
---
Clearly you do not understand how layering works because it has no effect on log in times....
---
One month free goddamm
---
He said 4 of the top guilds. So he's implying the 4 guilds ranked 1-4.
---
Heya! I'v always been curious about multiboxing so I hope you don't mind me asking. Why do you multibox? I personally have never understood it but I'v seen many people doing it so there must be something in it.
---
Last boss in Uldaman has some sick weapons with slow attack speed. I'm using the Rockpounder which has 2% crit and its insane! I'm a paladin tho
---
Arugal Alliance because we are all alpha chads that fuck on the Horde even though we are completely out numbered
---
It does feel like it doesnt sell well at all. Currently i just do it f√∂r free to a friend saving up for lionheart. I think ive sold one since launch and i hit 60 on the sunday after launch week. 
---
When i did sell it, it was for like 7g.  The extreme overflow of materials due to layer abuse has hit all markets super super hard.  Once its gone (soon i hope) prices will rise and even out. 
---
So even if you arent selling the actual use of the transmute. Id still use it on CD and save the bar since the worth will go up once layering is gone.  It typically went for 70ish gold per bar on pservers and even they had apparently abit too much access to nodes. 
---
Currently the bar goes for like 33g on my server.  
---
The crystal for 30.  So you see how that effects the Price or the actual transmute.

Yeah, they definitely have something going on kicking people. This keeps happening to me. I leave my char logged in and remote in to jump every few minutes while making dinner etc and I finally get back to playing and I DC. It happens almost every night now. Whitemane queue is slowly declining though which is nice.
---
Nothing you do 1-59 really matters? Whaaaat?
---
So maxing your proffessions, getting pre raid bis does not matter at 60? Hmmmm... Pretty sure you are wrong there.
---
Plus I mean it really matters that you have fun. And well classic leveling is that.
---
Ahh i shoulda just read the title lmfao thanks bro
---
RIP for all the dominated faction wanting to go from Arathi to Hillsbrad
---
2hrs is a pretty big commitment tho, and you pretty much have to budget for three in case the lfg process is slow. There are few times I get that kinda time which is a shame because dungeons are fun
---
Found the undead rogue

Kek
---
Stay away from STV if you want to maintain that love.
---
Ohh and play at off peak times because everything is camped to the ground. I tried out some questing today in Tanaris. There were about 15 people on the quest spot. Constantly killing everything in existence. I then went ahead and got back into ZF again.
---
the good selling kind
---
Weapon Skill effects them, however.
---
Shout outs to the only Night Elf to ever show up in a WoW pre-rendered CGI cinematic. You go random Druid.
---
I use MS for leveling cause it's great but in dungeons, it's sunder, revenge, shield block, the odd t clap and demo shout. Plus topping up battle shout. On top of that I'm switching to get zerker rage to generate more rage/intercept sometimes then to battle stance for mocking blow sometimes. There's just a lot to do so MS and 30 rage too costly for 5 man's but with a nice slow 2h for PvE questing it's great
---
Healing can be done in feral spec. Just get int (cloth?) items and you'll be good all the way through 55.
---
Now this is a strategy
---
ud warrior meh.
---
" I've seen streamers tank with no shield".
---
This is a sign when to find an another group.
---
He was 3 lvls higher and the 2 warriors were my level. 3v1 and I got away, I think they were all bad. Its just the persistence of them chasing me for so long as 3v1. It was really satisfying to get away.
---
Shadowmeld FTW
---
What do you reckon for improved cleave with the current meta of melee cleave dungeons. I've been wondering about it whilst levelling
---
Agreed! But still probably the best class synergy you could get out of this weapon together with shamys
---
What is even more funny to me, is exactly what people gain from following this guy. Is he an arbiter of wisdom, joy and fun?
---
I don't want to come across like an asshole by saying this, but he just seems like a legitimately boring person. Seriously, I can't understand how people find him so entertaining. Look at his damn followers, it's insane. Same for all the Youtubers these days. What is it about them that makes them become worshipped by such a massive amount of people? 
---
I just don't understand. I think I'm getting old, tbh.
---
Made 100g off of farming shellfish in maybe 14 hours play time.
---
The only thing that I agree with in this is that the community is all about themselves and not group benefits. Otherwise the community has been fine.
---
The previous record was 4days 20hrs so still under a week and that is without layers if you want to talk pure optimisation.  
---
So a hunter and mage leveled at fastest speeds could be done with just over a week played.  A no lifer cld manage  the 2 60s and a 50 by now and still have time to sleep 8 hrs a day.  Given people have starved both themselves and their kids playing wow since vanilla I don't think it's that unlikely at all tbh.  I'd be shocked if there wernt players like this rn.
---
A little tip for all you aspiring anglers out there looking to hit it rich with Stonescales, their drop rate GREATLY varies depending on when you fish.
---
Rate greatly increases from 12AM to 12PM (approximately 15%-20% rate increase)
---
Rate greatly decreases from 12PM on, until midnight. (depending on the zone, it will be no more than a 1% to 2% drop rate)
---
In order, the best places to obtain Stonescales are:
---
1. Bay of Storms, Azshara
---
2. Steamwheedle Port, Tanaris
---
3. Revantusk Village, Hinterlands (Horde)
---
4. Feathermoon Outpost, Feralas (Alliance)
---
Remember the screenshots of literal lines of people waiting on quest objectives? Without layers, that line would be ten times longer. The only way to do kill quests would be to form a group and camp a single spawn point. And that would go on for the first two weeks as people slowly spread out in levels. It would be a miserable experience for everyone.
---
Is there anykind of ui software ? It is long, boring, and difficult to make it. While i'm pretty good at programing.
---
Orc, but very little. Pet damage is a bit more.
---
Uh, do you see frost bolt + fire blast + cone of cold doing most of anyone's health bar, or is your monitor not on? You strike me as someone who thinks it's difficult to play mage to feel better about having so many more tools than most other classes
---
Sigh...
---
Yes of course, if it isn't possible to get 2-3 hours of time for the game in one block, it definitely isn't the game for you. Most people I know get back from work, make themselves some food and then they can easily have an uninterrupted 4-8 hours.
---
The bad parts aren't as bad because you've grown to be a better player. So this time around you are more equipped to deal with them thus making even the bad parts a bit more enjoyable as you can feel your own sense of progression.
---
Between 2.8g for a fire to 1g for the cresting
---
We don‚Äôt know yet 
---
Blizzard Said they don‚Äôt know yet either 
---
They said however that if demand is high enough they might update to tbc at some point 
---
We have around a year until that question matters maybe more

Benediction is uh... a classic wow server.
---
Hello, friends. I'm a tank and have been since 2006. Let me pull ( which is btw why WARRIOR TANKS need the best ranged weapons, not hunters ... ) and pull safely, or choose death. You'll likely wear cloth if you do not like this concept so repairs will be light.  
---
GL and HF :)
---
Flat Azeroth Theory is an awesome guild name.
---
Cool, go for my pet, I'll just down you lol.
---
There always are SM and ZF parties. And BRD probably as well. But not 60 dungeons.
---
Literally caught a dude WTB just then, 4g but I'll take it
---
In Melee Cleave groups, a tank is pretty much just another dps that gets initial aggro and tanks bosses. They're still doing their job and are vital to the group, not to mention their most important job is setting the pace of the run. 
---
And yeah it's still fucked up imo to call out tanks in a vaccuum just as I think it's dumb to call out dps in a vaccuum who are pulling slightly below the tank.
---
Isn't there a client ID token for this exact purpose?
---
All in all I think aoe grinding as a mage is the most lucrative. Especially if you know what sells on the ah
---
Whoosh
---
We'd be playing on dead servers right now if it wasn't for layering.
---
Basically the story of their blood-curse.
---
This is correct, yes. I'm curious, what are the main Alliance quest hubs at those levels? I recall questing in Duskwood, running away from Stitches and Mor'Ladin (?) on the one character I tried leveling on that side! Also been jumped in Ashenvale by some Alliance players and there's the Ally base dead smack inbetween Zoram strand and the east side of the map that Horde needs to skirt around. Some unfortunate (or tactical) choice of base location.
---
yep it's pretty neat in pve too to skip patrols :D
---
Resolve what...?
---
10g is like 15 min of farming
---
I can absolutely relate to that. I am more likely to help a player of the opposing faction than to attack them. Except if they attacked me in the past (I add everyone who does that to my kill on sight list) or if they are competing for a valuable ressource.
---
:-D :-D :-D
---
Floating Combat text in interface options
---
I had some random mage in my grp yesterday in SM cathedral. Everything went absolutly fine. We pulled 2-4 mobs per pull and had a decent pace. Then miss titling mage decided to flame our healer for chatting to much, me pulling less than she wanted because her "AoE was going to waste with only 2 mobs" and our 2nd mage for not spamming blizzard like she did. (She did less damage lol) 
---
We kicked her after several times of "chill out" and "I'm doing this at a comfortable pace".   
---
Did a 4man run and we were almost as fast with packs as we were before her kick.
---
Moral of the story: Some mages are idiots.
---
Then cap the server population lower and do away with layers. If you pick a server with a population that high then you should know what pros and cons it comes with anyways.
---
Why does everyone hate achievments???? It's just fucking stat tracking! Sorry that I like stat tracking.

Nah nobody on HS ally is worried at all. You know you're extra salty about horde ganks when this is your response.

All that typing and so little reading.

Look at your own post history how many flame wars have you gotten in?

Ever stop to wonder if your the toxic one?

Warcraft Tavern has some leveling guides.  They are designed for efficiency but they are also very helpful for guiding you in the right direction.  They sometimes mention grinding out an extra level or doing dgs. 
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com
---
Everything you've said here is just interior to linking taladrils guide imo.  It's not that I disagree with what you've said it's just a less informative extremely watered down post compared to taladrils.
---
This is an interesting development. Looks like I‚Äôve found my alt race.
---
Show me where a blizzard employee has said that.
---
So your answer to someone who doesn't want to run dungeons to level is get to Level 29 ASAP and start running dungeons. Got it.

You'll run into 2 types of shadow priests.  One that doesn't leave shadowform ever, and the other which will.  The one that leaves form to use holy spells, is the one I'd be concerned with.  In both cases, you need to keep distance.  Mindflay has a short range, and their other defensive shadow tactic is fear which has a very short range.  keeping distance is key.  also having as many buffs as possible up at the beginning helps because it's a bunch of nonsense they have to dispel to get you down to nothing, and since dispel is % based, this eats up their mana quick.  Also, decurse vampiric embrace.  30% of their damage heals them with this on you.  don't let it stay up, and they'll be losing hp fast.  Last, dampen magic is a must, and shield is a must, but don't use the one which damage is absorbed by your mana, because if I see that mana shield up, I'm mana burning you to nothing in 3 seconds.  Save counters for when they're low Hp.  30-50% chances are they're going to try and pop off a flash heal which is 1.5seconds.  So when you get in that hp range, you want to really pay attention to them to see if they cast holy.  When it starts, counter, then burn them down with spells, and hopefully, you got them.  Most of the smarter ones will silence you if hey get countered, so you're both jumping around in your robes doing nothing looking silly for 4 seconds.  
---
Realistically, Mages have a hard time with shadow priests.  Priests are just very efficient in 1v1 dealing with mana based classes (except for warlocks).  Most of the times I got beat, it was realistically a gank from behind with POM/Pyro/Trinket combo, which usually was a 1 shot without a shield.  Other than that, due to the dispels and mana burn, it's a hard fight.
---
It says bind on use
---
I mean, its pretty ok for a paladin, I wouldn't use it on a warrior though. Still gratz, you are happy about it, which is nice :)
---
Grob seems to be down to just 2 or 3 layers.
---
Depends, I like to spam heal warlocks that hellfire AoE damage because this increases speed just so much. I also stop healing mages once they ran out of mana and instead heal the warlock.
---
I am interested in you detailing further this point about not actively switching to cheetah. I am trying to get good at switching to cheetah because it seems it's a key ability despite the inherent risks. So, when is it that you'd be better off with just speed enchant?
---
And what's the speed enchant value? 8% right?
---
You're essentially paying extra for a power boost.
---
It can also be lucrative if you use it in the correct way, funneling a lot of gold to your main character that you gear up the most
---
What is  **Spellcleave**  ?
---
Then you run into the issues of servers running out of people and people complaining about server merges.
---
Kind of a shame seeing warcraftmovies.com die.
---
It had so much excellent content. And most of it dead now.
---
Real MVP here. 
---
A cool solution for Blizzard could be to give the guards ranged attacks. They could switch to bows, charge or throw grappling hooks.
---
Why is Rexxar?
---
An undead warlock
---
15% I think
---
Nah there was plenty, 14 year old me can confirm that, haha.
---
&gt;Having such a ridiculous armor rating essentially serves as a Bears form of defense rating (defense cap is overrated to begin with) and the giant health pool helps buffer that. They mitigate less damage than a Warrior but are built to take it on the chin.
---
and they feel like shit to heal
---
if i can skip or whine to not have to heal a bear i will keep qqing
---
15 years. 15 years I've been reading that as Gad-get-zan, holy shit
---
Why is berserker stance a dwarf tho
---
Yep, easy, you wont get anxious by not playing or angry by being camped, and happily exp the other character with class you always liked but didnt have time to try
---
No
---
he has to be exalted with darnassus.
---
also random fact but mechanostriders are only usable by dwarf and gnome, and taurens can only ride kodos and wolves
---
Nahh man, ravager warriors are the best at holding threat.
---
Alright will do, thank you!
---
Maybe he is lvl 14?
---
They wanna pretend that not wanting slutmogs for female characters means you support sharia law
---
Well. No. You fooled an enemy.
---
He‚Äôs trying to be sneaky with that capture
---
Ya nobody from the private server world thinks that feral are meme specs. Most guilds bring them to alleviate having to gear our a third warrior tank right and away.  They were also used quite heavily in naxx, my guild is currently using a feral Druid.
---
Oh okay so he still needs to be exalted regardless if I buy the mount and trade it with him even though he can train for the mount?
---
But muh no changes
---
I go to SM and stay there for 14 levels.
---
I subbed for another month, i'm probably complete at 60 by then.
---
Sweet hit
---
Gnome has higher int though.
---
wait WHAT? 
---
i assumed mages can do it for free...am i begging ressources out of them when i ask for water?
---
mess around with an online talent calculator untill you find something you like would be my advice

welp

---
Not sure if fire resist gear helps, but I know it‚Äôs beneficial to jump up out of the lava as much as possible.
---
&gt; Most companies are like that.
---
Tier 1 support gets paid to close tickets.
---
Tier 2 support gets paid to fix problems with the software.
---
Tier 3 support gets paid to fix problems with the hardware.
---
Tier 4/"real customer service" gets paid to fix problems for the people.
---
It sucks, but that's how it is. The real MVP is the tier 1/tier 2 drone that works like he's Tier 4/CS.
---
There's a reason the hell-desk has so much turnover. All the good ones move up, or move out.
---
You didn't think critically about the point of an open world.
---
What's the point of tracking auto-attack swings on a shaman?
---
Maybe hold onto it and see if any other ones sell on the AH, and sell around that price? Or you could always sell in trade chat to see what kind of offers you get.
---
You argue like a woman
---
To reach cap against lvl 63 bosses you need something like +16% hit iirc.
---
The amount of stuff you need for the quest makes it so that only one guy per guild gets it and all others in the guild help him get the stuff 
---
And the first one to get there will prolly immediately hit the gong
---
Especially when there‚Äôs a mage who definitely handed out water.
---
I'm a healer so I never see other healers. What they do?
---
Spellcleave is a big part of the issue, though. I can count on maybe one or two hands the decent mages I've seen at max level so far of the hundreds I've been grouped with.
---
They turn off their brains completely and don't know how to play and utilize their class at all. Half of them don't even know how to polymorph. Less than half of those that do don't have understanding enough to know when they should without me having to hold their hand.
---
Maybe the server economy isnt at the point yet where they are in high demand. But when you have things like TF, lionheart helm, nightfall, annihilator etc that require quite a bit of these... the demand will ALWAYS be there.
---
Back in Vanilla, I would duel a lot outside iron forge on my warlock.  The only class I ever had trouble beating were rogues. I would eat mages for breakfast, even higher level mages. 
---
Now, could I still do it now? No because I‚Äôm old and I suck.
---
A split ony with 3 extra people? Nothing to see here....
---
You can say shit now.   It was removed from the banned word list in 2005.
---
I think he means queueue
---
Blizzard did specifically modify the classic bnet so you wouldn't be able to cross faction whisper and such.
---
Don't know why showing realm would be added to that exclusion list though.
---
I think his issue is with the ones who don‚Äôt attempt to replenish their health at all
---
Clam meat has no worth?
---
Shit man, you gone done poked a hornets nest!
---
Layering has no effect on any of the chat channels, so removing it won't help you there.
---
Well, you do get dishonorable kills for killing civilians in npcs so theres some kind of logic to it.
---
Beat me to it, I thought of Drax as well. Have my upvote
---
6 days but there's no telling how much of that was semiafk
---
ISN‚ÄôT IT NICE TO HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY?
---
No shit, Sherlock. Of course they won't care about me, but once the Honor system is implemented they'll farm all the Horde they can, don't you think? But yeah, misinterpreting a comment on purpose just to post a scathing reply is cool too.
---
I once saw a horde priest doing the feralas chicken escort. I was just running to the ship and saw him all alone starting it thinking that this guy will die and waste 10 minutes for no reason, I helped him escort the chicken all the way ^^
---
Agreed. Having the same problem. We chose a low pop server after started on high pop because of queues. Now I'm 60 on a server that is really starting to feel dead.
---
exactly my thought...this looks bad but it isn't THAT bad since XP-gains increase (but yeah they increase slower than the needed-curve does)
---
This is such a dumb post. What are you, 12?
---
I tried playing wow retail with dual monitors but as soon as i move mouse out of game screen it minimize wow screen, but problem mught be with kouse as same thing happend to me other time, where my cprd was demaged and if mouse isnt connected coursore wi disapper, but it could only connection where it is bugged little and then return to normal
---
Oh no, I said after they help you.  You obv kill them at a time so you can complete the quest first.  Red is dead yada yada yada.
---
On a side note the Feralas escort can be done with almost no fight after the yeti cave if you climb on your mount and aggro the mob and just leash them, by the time they go back the chicken is safely past their spawn.  
---
This works in Tanaris as well for the ransoms mobs but the spwans are around the chicken so you have no way to dodge them.
---
nice :)
---
Woah nonchalant and unnecessary sexism in the mix, noice!
---
Yeah except all the changes ruining wpvp
---
"herp derp imma reply to this guy multiple times that'll teach em"
---
That's sexy.
---
fake, also shield is worse then no shield until end game dungeons.
---
Just don't ress him. DPS need to know exactly how insignificant they are in the grand scheme of things.
---
what do you mean? then I can finally play the game.
---
I really don't know the problems people have, a friend reached level 120, 430+ and necklevel 63 in 3 weeks
---
A++++ explanation
---
Love your stuff. Great style and humor.
---
Shoulda stuck out the Herod struggle bus homie.
---
dunno haven't checked because I only want to see it at 60, I am 29 atm
---
Alchemist/Enchant is my go to for an alt. Enchanting can DE anything right from level 1 and alchemy can be used to support multiple different professions and supply plenty of useful consumables.
---
on the bottom of the circle....no math needed
---
and to calculate the actual level, no math will solve that for you with the information from this graphic
---
Shazzrah-EU. Full of Russians and Brazilian streamers, the community is so toxic you wouldn‚Äôt believe this is world of Warcraft... honestly it‚Äôs so sad, no buffs, even when asking. Only reason I joined is because my friend was on the server, now he‚Äôs quit WOW and I‚Äôve put in 5 days /played which is precious time for me now. Honestly feels like I‚Äôm playing a free for all game. :(
---
1) how does allowing more people to play on a server at the same time not affect queue times? That's retarded. 
---
2) there weren't 3 day queues in vanilla, but there are literally 10x the amount of people playing on high pop servers now than there were high pop servers in vanilla. Can you do math?
---
Its the streamers that makes people do whatever they do. I say, screw that shit man. I specced single target frosty mage now and now i can actually do damage!
---
Darnassus is a hat for Kalimdor.
---
I have to hear this story.
---
soon she'll be wearing full length pants. THE HORROR *hides in corner*
---
Same. Don't get this mentality of rolling PvP and getting annoyed when people PvP.
---
So I made about 50 gold within 8-12 hours of running ZF. A typical run nets you like 4-5 gold. You can also make about 10 Gold per hour with fishing.
---
Those fucking rock elementals...
---
Couldn't agree more, this is the only reason I have Twitter!
---
My server is medium pop, no queues, and there's always people around in every zone. Stop bitching about such a minimal thing you unemployed neckbeard.
---
Should be ally though. Because these phrases are only ally to horde.
---
Horde to ally has some cool stuff like Anal Kill as well
---
Earthshaker. Migrated from firemaw which was a clusterfuck. The server is growing, there is only 1 layer so i see the same people over and over again. I can actually farm herbs, nodes, satyrs. No 5 hour que.. Feels like classic in terms of populations. I have only nice things to say. I transfered 1. 5 week ago and only since then ive seen the server coming alive, there is so many new faces amd guilds coming daily. I would urge anyone if their unsure about transfering to give it it a go, for the first tile in a few weeks i am looking forward to logging on to play and have fun.. Not like a chore i felt it was on firemaw. Alot less elitist attitude and helpful People :)
---
good thing you don't HAVE to go with people who  do that. somebody else who doesn't see it as a problem will join them and everything is fine
---
ahh Symbiosis, yeah also, I do know that Class reworks are what's keeping the game alive, but the classes seem.... less fun to me, I like where they have gone with some classes like Hunters in BfA and hated where they gone with Warriors for example
---
Seriously... 10 minutes? Lol
---
Stupid idea. I was there once and it was camped by 5 people. There is a reason they are so expnesive.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
When the item sells you get the full deposit back, yeah. You also lose a small 5% cut of the sales price to the auction house, or 15% if you're selling in a neutral auction house. You probably just didn't notice it before whenever you were clearing out your mailbox :)
---
I've stayed online for 4 hours using Google Remote Desktop
---
What do you reccomend for the 30-40 grind. Ideally not just spamming SM. I play alliance priest and am always grouped with a rogue. We did duskwood, red ridge, wetlands, ashenvale. It always seems to drag for me at 30 (have a 40 and 35 as well) 
---
Cheers bud.
---
Lmaooo
---
Not losing your cool at all my dude
---
deactivated it.
---
With 1.4 speed it's super bad. Gutripper has a higher damage range and costs like 25-35g.
---
Private servers had massively amped up spawn rates to deal with population sizes which fucked up the economy massively. No thanks.
---
Hot take: Dishonorable kills suck and were the start of the downward spiral with PvP.
---
Must have full preraid Bis
---
Because that's the default? Are you saying there's another solution?
---
Honestly I think Blizz would love to know, layering causes issues that aren't ideal for them but not having layers causes issues too. If you've got an idea to fix both problems in one go and send feedback to them.
---
Level 41 mage - help me senpai - aoe farming or good questing zones?
---
What? They're literally so easy to heal. Get them to throw in a rejuv before big pull and u barely have to heal them at all
---
You might compare warriors and tanks to nails and screws:)
---
Yes they both do roughly the same job, but depending on the situation one will be slightly better, the other can still do it though it might be more work:)
---
There is the issue with layering though. With so many people still playing, it might be needed on some servers for a while more, and they've stated they wish to remove it before phase 2. So if they can't remove it, maybe they will postpone phase 2. But, we don't know.
---
GRATS! I gave up and used the mace from mograine instead.
---
Do you understand how multiplication works?
---
Squad up, then bitch.
---
I can't help explain it if you're being purposefully dense. How does a bigger bucket hold more water? Fucking magic, I guess.
---
Ahh, yes. It was something with 5 :)
---
Thanks, but gosh do I hate pir charts
---
That‚Äôs true, on closer inspection loonyluna is using a mace so can‚Äôt be her. She‚Äôs probably just investigating the crime.
---
Feelsbadman
---
So because a tank wants to dps as a tank everyone else has to watch what they do and work around them ok got it now I know so I just won‚Äôt use high damage attacks and wait even longer before starting to attack. That makes sense now
---
I just respecced at 49.
---
Suddenily hitting 1.3k crits is fucking glorious.

Syas the moron using old ass outdated data. We are on 1.12/1.13 NOT 1.2.

Projection.

I went 7 times and got shoulders 6 times, I just want the helmet aaaah
---
Wipe your tears with that devilsaur leather
---
Well it‚Äôs a good thing this was in response to someone else‚Äôs question, and not you who seems to know how to make gold easily.
---
What exactly is an Anal Kill
---
Tbf it‚Äôs the same with rogues if you can‚Äôt get the opener and sometimes they fuck you even if you can.
---
Why tf would a warrior want bryntroll, that was a unholy dk/retri weapon. Also dbw was trinket everybody melee+hunter wanted only exception being retri pal.
---
You are missing the point. It was expected that people will go away from classic, so blizzard solving the queue problem with tons of new servers was always temporary...
---
You‚Äôre the only one crying, i assume your unchecked aggression is your cry for help
---
And if they start spinning just stop healing and attack and wait for them to be done
---
I'm swapping on my alt Shaman at 40 though I know 44 is like a new rank in both LB and CL or something like that.
---
Good post. As you seem to know a lot about Bear Druid can I ask does bear tank gear fit for PvP? I imagine it‚Äôs reasonable for flag running, is it optimal for fighting in PvP or is the gear different.
---
You never cared in the first place.
---
Now I want to level a mage and prove everyone wrong :D
---
So you would rather have 3 layers worth of people farming on a single layer? Pretty sure it would cause more rage from people not being able to farm because there is too many people.
---
Way to miss the point, buddy. All I said was on pvp servers, you can't make both alliance and horde toons.
---
I hat3 tanking in classic as everyone just seems o instantly use any aoe they have as soon as I've pulled. Warriors in particular are terrible at charging in and WW before I've got the second hit off. I always tell people to give me a second rebuild threat because I'm allergic to the taunt button and after the first time they die the run becomes much smoother
---
As a mage, paladin tanks are God tier spell cleave tanks. Consecration + BOP + iron grenade are broken as all hell while leveling. But for end game content? No contest, see every other reply.
---
I would rather not have horde paladins/Ally shamans. or jewelcrafting. Gems are such a boring feature anyway.
---
There's plenty of leather items with int too.
---
Implying those Kobolds didn't get what was coming to them.
---
I can agree on the part with the bfa- mentality, but that's only a few players, at least on my server. 
---
Otherwise I have a lot of fun and a great guild.
---
But everyone can have their own opinion.
---
40 isn't even half way lol
---
The further from end game lvl 60 you are, the less traditional tanking in neccessary. As you get into lvl 60 dungeons and further into raiding, more classical warrior tanking will be needed strictly from a stat/mechanics point. Warriors will need the increased block and armor to avoid taking too much damage from bosses or healers might not be able to maintain enough healing.
---
How is Mankriks Wife?
---
You should come to RPPVP. The community here is GREAT
---
Ahh i dont play fury so i didnt realize
---
Same thing happened in booty bay for me: horde was shooting ppl from water and guards didn't swim to him. Alliance swam out and hit him and suddenly guards came swimming. I think it's a bug
---
That's a worse solution in my opinion.  More smaller servers means more division in population - more queue times due to smaller servers - smaller overall population than doing layering for a phase then dropping said layering.  You're talking about ruining the future health of the realms in favor of making the first phase 'better' for everyone.  
---
And when I say 'better' I mean very very marginal and probably actually much worse.  All of this to solve people doing city raids and counter raids during a time when you can't even earn honor?  Or is it for the instance layering issue which was already fixed and people banned for?
---
Not the OP, but I also main Shaman, and tank from time to time, though not to this level. During a SM Cath farm group, our tank dipped and while trying to find a new one, I took over. By the end of that run, I was our main tank and we were looking for a DPS. I tanked that farm group for about 4 hours, and the Priest at the end said I was the best tank he had run with all day.   
---
The best way I can put it, is a good Shaman tank will be on par to an average Warrior in terms of pretty much everything. An average or below warrior won't properly use CDs, and you'll also never see a shaman tank with anything but a shield, so they tend to be pretty middle of the road on tankiness. If the Shaman specs into tank talents, they'll be actually near par with warriors, especially once they get mail armor at 40, and their only real issue is large pack AoE threat. Honestly they're probably a better boss tank in some cases than a Paladin, because between Flurry ((Psuedo-Windfury)) Procs, and Max Rank ES Generating almost as much aggro as taunt, they can pull aggro on single mobs pretty easy.
---
If buying gold was something they wanted in Classic they would've added the WoW token rather than letting 3rd party websites deal with it
---
Are there any groups out there leveling that want to play the game right and enjoy the instances and actually have some fun ?
---
Buy them from mages. Not from vendors. I often give mages 50 silver and they, in turn, give me 120 water. A lot better than paying 40 silver for 5 water.
---
If a mob cant path to you they become invulnerablr, players have no such advantage to people exploiting the terrain.
---
*My candle.*
---
Yes but you'll see a bunch of "no"s on the next thread that someone rolls greed and loses an item to the one guy who rolled need. Comes up about 600 times a day.
---
Ya I lose my shit on people and have my posts deleted when im ‚Äúamused‚Äù too
---
Tiny plates
---
Which is a bullshit recipe though as you need goldthorn for it.
---
Just something funny and vulgar to enrage PvP opponents
---
Horde says 'f j f d 108 d', Alliance reads 'a n a l kil l'.
---
30-43 is where it gets most rough imo despite the numbers. Once you're out of the stranglethorn/arathi/Badlands bracket things really speed up.
---
So using a skill AS INTENDED you consider to be an exploit? Wtf?
---
Hydraxian Waterlords - because RP really adds flavour to the experience.
---
Started with 7 friends, 2 resubbed, 1 is starting school and will be playing barely half as much.
---
We all started knowing nothing about it, so I‚Äôd say go for it. Learning and discovering things is the best part of the game!
---
Because server merging isn't wow classic. Server transfers yes, but the day they start doing server merges is the day classic is no longer classic. Its all about your server is your community. That is lost when they do server merges.
---
I use shield only if it the first time for me to tank a particular dungeon. When I am more comfortable with a dungeon or heal I run around with 2 hander, but I use my shield against bosses anyways. Most of them even in low level dungeons hit pretty hard.
---
You're still messaging me on multiple threads at 3am it's pretty clear you're shook.
---
\&gt; Hope people learn a lesson from it! 
---
Narrator: they don't
---
That sounds like something that could become a tiny legend among the wow community.
---
I know it's pretty similar in other games, usually you have t buy "book of memory loss" or some item like that but in other games it's free.
---
Was the reason why respecing your talents costing money ever talked about? 
---
I would really like to test out different builds and specs without either having to accumulate insane amounts of gold or having to level multiple characters.
---
I'm no expert but so far I don't see how you could get any unfair advantage out of respecing for free. Aren't there even some classes, where when you want to min max, you pretty much have to decide whether you purely want to play PvE/PVP because different builds just aren't viable for that?
---
I would say yes, mainly for professions. You can get max professions at level 35. This means you can have an alchemist/goblin eng at level 35 that is fed mats from your main. That alt can also make money from arcanite transmutes and potentially from class abilities, like portals. 
---
This is all achievable without having to hit level 60 on the alt. And if you do, they make great gatherers or gold makers. Lots of options.
---
Yeah but not being able to use 5 points is pretty toxic design. Redirect ftw
---
Ehn. If you're not above cheating in a multiplayer game you're not above giving a shot at lying to the company that banned you for your cheating.
---
Any ban for cheating is going to get some percentage of bannees bring in appeals claiming they weren't cheating. When you do a massive banwave, even if every ban is perfectly justified, a lot of cheaters will claim they were unjustly banned.
---
So it can be hard to tell whether all those people making appeals are due to your algorithm malfunctioning, or whether they are liars making a hail mary to overturn your ban.
---
If it looks a lot more than expected it's a reason to look into it, sure; but the initial customer service grunts looking into the appeals? They have no choice but to trust the algorithm.
---
IME it feels more shit to heal warriors, because 50% of the time I have to heal the dps as well.
---
On a somewhat related note.
---
Me and a complete stranger spent over an hour completing a quest in silverpine forest as undead yesterday.
---
It was hell on earth we died about 10x each, trying to infiltrate this fortress attempting to reach our goal....in the end we spawned on the rooftop and like a pair of Spetsnaz and worked our way down.
---
Despite its endless flaws it was glorious and eventually we won, i only meant to log on for 20 minutes.
---
For the first time in forever i experienced a gaming memory that will stick with me for a long time and instilled into some screenshots.
---
Risk vs reward - THATS what gaming is all about, thats what it should always be about!
---
Achievements are over a decade old, you cant use that meme and act like youre right. Achievements  suck because people treat them as content when they really arent.
---
Are you not doing the identical thing?
---
10 points for the conkers bad fur day music
---
First time I did it the server crashed as I was finishing the final wave. Had to repeat the entire thing.
---
Yeah that's what I've been reading. It says you need to be exalted to even have the option to buy the mount from him. I was just wondering since the mount says bind on use of I could just read with him or if they limited you to the mount till your exalted. Ty for the information :)
---
It really is - because that's what's happening.  Layering is a perfectly good solution that will seemingly be good for the long term health of the servers but people are complaining because they can't do a proper city raid in the first month of classic (when honor still hasn't been introduced by the way).
---
With ranged threat as well, if its a caster, you can cast Rank 1 ES to inturrupt and pull them in that way. I've had greater success with that than most 'Meta' tanks have with trying to get aggro of them.
---
I don't think this is about winning the fight :)
---
Yes but that is the thing, I said this because your tip just isn't very good. When someone has trouble getting gold I wouldn't recommend something that has such a low return of gold.
---
This has largely been my experience as well. Threat has been fine with a shield and it‚Äôs a lot safer. That said, all these 2h posts are encouraging me to give it a shot.
---
Happens to the best of us! classicdb.ch is your friend. The comments help out a lot.
---
&gt; Blizzard inability to ban people that buy power-levelling services and gold. On the server i have played on i have personally encountered 10+ people that have bought power-levelling services, they have been reported by 5+ people and nothing happens. People talk openly about how they bought gold to buy epic mounts. No action taken by blizzard.. 
---
The game is running for a month now. And as the past has shown, Blizz mostly bans in waves for bigger TOS infractions.
---
It carried me all the way up until I got the axe from the quest reward from SM.

 [NeatPlates](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates) \- A Tidyplate-like nameplate addon with a variety of preset and customization options, including debuff tracking, color coding based on hostility or threat, and more. Ensure you download the [Classic version](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates/files) 
---
It changes the health bar above the target to show your debuff (CC, dot, ...) with duration.
---
You are not allowed to get tired of the mindless circlejerk
---
With the way the AH is atm, this is worth about 3g50s.
---
At some point, druids in WoW could use a spell called "Symbiosis" on a target. Their target got a druid spell, and the druid got one in return. 
---
10/10 cool ability, which Blizzard obviously removed because it was too fun.
---
If you're duo leveling you could very well go Feral and your buddy could collect cloth/leather/mail with int/spirit, then you could do dungeons and tank + healer and just fill in the DPS slots. You can of course also collect healing/caster gear to do the healing part, but a Druid is a much better tank than Shammy so from a que perspective tank + healer is far more optimal - plus it puts the two of you in charge, tank and healer set the pace of the dungeon. Well, at least unless you're all for the new spellcleave meta.
---
If you (any of you) want to do Resto, level \~52-55 somewhere is where it may be worth respeccing. Postponing it will maintain your solo capacity for questing etc longer, but will also make later dungeon bosses more difficult to heal.
---
I cant disagree with you more. I joined a guild prior to classic being released, was on discord with them for a few months before the game launched. They couldnt be nicer. Great players, happy to help and fun.  Lots of hardcore players were 60 in the 1st few weeks, and they all help lower levellers doing elite quests.  All are great at crafting things for guildmates. 
---
The server I joined, EU- Mirage Raceway - is great. I'm currently level 49, and have encountered only a handful of bad players as I levelled. Most are nice, polite, helpful and sociable.  I'm actually loving the courtesy shown on horde side, players queuing for mob spawns, grouping up and helping each other. Also, had several alliance help me with quests and I've done the same. 
---
All in all, classic has more than surpassed expectations for me. I am loving it, and couldnt be more happy about the guild and server I am playing in.
---
Again, you started talking to me, keep pretending.
---
Your backpack is one giant clusterfuck filled with random food and low level gems and maths. Tidy up dude!
---
Can confirm, in ZF I would always first fill in people from my guild or FL before I go about searching randoms.
---
whatever dude
---
That's true, but there will be dead servers regardless and the lesser evil is to merge them in my opinion.
---
 I don‚Äôt remember the details but back in vanilla I remember someone kiting Stitches I to a lowbie area like gold shire or west fall and waited for tons of people to start attacking it then feigned death. Fucking laid waste to everyone. It was awesome.
---
*Look at me.*
---
*I am the tank now.*
---
Woah its almost like statement can having meaning without being completely explicit in its wording!
---
You argue like an idiot.
---
&gt;Feral tanks are more than viable for almost all content.
---
Yeah. Everyone knows this. Feral tanks arent considered a meme spec in the same way balance druids are. Im sure 95% of the players now that feral tanks are good dungeon tanks and that they can tank raidbosses too. The problem is they cant tank ALL raidbosses so they will never be main tank. Feral tanks aren't a meme tank spec but they are a meme main tank spec.
---
Hell yeah bear-other!
---
I had 4 gold when I started farming and within one night I had already bought my mount. 
---
To me, this was worth the time investment. 
---
If it isn‚Äôt to you, that‚Äôs ok. 
---
But its up for the OP to decide if it benefits them or not.
---
This weapon is actually best used on a hunter because wingclip spam is the optimal way to get this badboy to proc haste for you and the boiz
---
I did, many many times. Some groups just don't listen.
---
Yes, from RFD/ZF and onward. Before that the cloth pieces are so much tastier for a healer, regardless of class.
---
well if you dont like it, then dont instance. Go about questing on your own, its simple!
---
Seems sensible.
---
#endlayering. What are they waiting for? They could have removed it week one and people would  have been fine.
---
Bring back shaman tanking! Was one of the things I looked forward to with Classic was Shaman tanking being brought back.
---
That and also Range tanking, Twin Emps in AQ40 will be so fun to watch!
---
how do keep threat against multiple mobs? shouts? cleave? thunderclap?
---
Great, so all you need to get a report sorted out properly, and not get punished is to make a thread blow up on reddit, and wait a week.
---
I don't why but the name broke my spine too. Comes from a guy who's name is a slang for genetalia.
---
Aaaand that's the rogue that's getting kicked from the group.
---
Now I'm jealous. That sounds like old WoW.
---
For PvP, the Catform talents are more useful. Feline swiftness for catching running targets (though I had a macro that would swap me from travel form to catform, but you lose the full energy bar).
---
You need the movement boost ench on boots. Keep swp on her and make sure you dont have nature dmg wand. Kite her around her room, trigger her aie, dodge stones and keep yourself fearwarded if ali. Gl hf
---
Excellent how the forsaken stance swap animation makes you look fearful and shocked here.
---
A solid minute of eye of kilrogg and thunderclapping, then 3 accounts aoeing spellcasting. What are you hoping to accomplish with this video?
---
There is always a drop-off, no matter the game. Thing is, Classic is not just like another game. The people who are most likely to drop-off, already did it.
---
The casuals set goals, and after reaching that goal, they decide to either stop, or continue to the next goal.
---
The chances are are most players will not quit in the first 6 months of Classic, simply because there is SO MUCH to do as a casual, it's frightening. Two-three months alone just to hit 60, for a casual. And what after lvl 60? Well, professions, 5 men, a raid now and then, alts, reputation...
---
The non-casuals will have their teeth deep inside Classic all the way to Naxx. They won't quit.
---
The first MAJOR drop will not be seen or felt until Phase 2. And I say major drop as in bigger than the tourist one, not major as in stupidly high. I don't see more than 20% quitting in P2. Can be 30%. Doesn't matter, MOST of them will be back for Phase 3 : BWL.
---
Classic will lose far less players than any other MMORPG in the first year.
---
From those the subbed or were subbed at launch, less than half will quit 1 year later.
---
I am really concerned that layering might be IMPOSSIBLE to be removed from a big number of realms. Every single realm that is HIGH atm (which is almost ALL realms) if it stays like this 2 months more from today...will either force Blizzard to remove layering and have massive pop realms with queues or keep layering and postpone Phase 2.
---
I think that they will choose to remove layering and have queues at leak hours, because it is the least hurting compared to the other option..
---
Well, the difference remains the same, right ? Or does it only affects greater healing ?
---
Could you tell me where or what wands to get after the greater magic wand? I'm level 20ish on both my mage and warlock and am still using the greater wand as I haven't found anything better in the world or in the auction house unless I want to pay insane amounts of gold for maybe +3 damage...
---
On the other hand, as a tank with a shield trying to clean dungeons properly, I constantly get groups spell cleaving and asking me why i'm not taking on10+ packs and telling me that I can't hold aggro when they constantly pull.
---
Retards are everywhere, trying to single out a class or two that all are retards IS retarded.
---
great kiting :D
---
Curious as to what talents you aim to get first while leveling? Kind of interested in trying this haha. Leveling as an ele shaman atm but might just roll a tank shaman alt
---
uhm, wont a feral hs tank die at 5% when the enrage hits?
---
I was under the impression that shieldwall is pretty mandatory there. 
---
Some other bosses that comes to mind as especially unsuited for druids would be nefarian and maexxna.
---
Warlocks, they only get better and better. Rogues will have kind of a hard time past 30 unless you're really good geared.
---
If you want an easy rule, sell weapon disenchant the rest. There are better ways in terms of benefit but with this you dont need any addon
---
Assert more assumptions at me bro.
---
Can't wait to see what your stupid mind spits out next.
---
its difficult until you unlock blueberry, then ezmode
---
It was a thing before Classic WoW was announced. From time to time, people would ask for legacy servers on those forums. 
---
It's an obnoxiously long and condescending copy pasta that "explains" why you are stupid for asking legacy servers.
---
If you can afford weapons, rogue is super fast. Lock is fast as far as minimal downtime and handling of adds.
---
But with nameplates there's often the issue that they are to far away or behind you. Do you know an AddOn where it just shows up on screen?
---
Wow forgive me for trying to play the game and enjoy the instances. Salty much I was just asking a simple question if there was a real reason for spinning around while mobs attack everyone else and a real reason other then being on top of a meter. But I guess your reply fits right with the dumbs ass warrior spinning around making train noises while the healer gets beat on makes perfect sense
---
I took all my monies from retail and subbed 14 months, so Thanks for that retail!
---
I have multiple alts between 20-35 and between 1-3 days played on each. Think it adds up to about 8 days or so. Which, considering I work full time and have a 1 year old son and a wife, goes to show just how much sleep I've sacrificed for this game lol
---
I feel absolutely attacked.
---
How do you feel shit about your self for not feeding some pixels other pixels lmao
---
Defensive stand and shield + 1-hand is sufficient for tanking up to early/mid 50's as long as you know how to handle your threat, don't overpull and keep an eye on healer's mana before pulls. Being Prot before that can make dungeons easier, but you will have a hard time outside of dungeons, i.e. soloing and questing. Hence the recommendations.
---
If you think you won't see full-blown fury tanks with no tank gear at all at level cap, I have to disappoint you.
---
It's not gonna be so good now, northdale did it on there private server and half the community quit because organised guilds were camping flight paths and killing anyone who landed.
---
I don't understand this mentality. Why are you playing on a PVP server of a game called "World of Warcraft"?
---
grow a pair
---
Warlock is really pleasant and smooth to level with. You just gotta learn the timings, when and which dots to which targets. Using VW you need to feel his aggro-capabilities etc. When done right you can keep rolling with very little to none downtime.

Poe's law. You put all that meaning yourself. Don't hurt yourself on that edge bro
---
Just got my first pet, yay~ But is it possible to turn off his name plate? I know his name and that he's my pet. I don't need to see that... 
---
I tried turning off friendly player pets, but that didn't work for mine... Any ideas?
---
Thanks, I'll have to look up on that!
---
You're not rolling for skinning, mining or herbalism either, right? You're welcome to bring the tools to open locked chests if you want a part of them.
---
Friend of mine made 11 million gold in vanilla from AH baroning all of our server's enchanting mats and is still coasting off it to this day in BfA. Not worth anywhere near as much anymore but it's still a fair amount.
---
I love this. Could easily imagine it on like the back of the game's box art, or in the inner flaps. Really gives a sense of mystery and adventure. I love the way the moon and the character's eyes really stand out in that darkness and seem to share the same beautiful colour. Perfect
---
Me too :S
---
Yeah but not every one knows about layering. It's not mentioned anywhere in game as far as I know
---
Read
---
Duh
---
Is there anyway to know if quests where you have to hunt drops will drop for everyone in the party or just the person who gets the drop?
---
I love the mage hate.
---
NERF THEM INTO THE ABYSS
---
What did you bring upon this cursed land!
---
I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.
---
3.
---
The people who could potentially use it are Paladins and Shamans, both of whom should be casting more or less constantly and (unless I'm mistaken about Paladins) should be stacking mp5.
---
You're right, that changes a few things then &amp; makes switching even more attractive
---
Warlock at 38 when you get better drain life, becomes so easy.
---
Then get dark pact at level 40ish and you basically can grind non stop for ever without stopping to drink or eat and always finish mobs with 90% health and mana
---
I would say yes because there are no things like in retail that you HAVE to do. Or rather you can do them at your own pace. You dont need to grind world quests every day to farm rep. Instead of farming rep 1h every day i could just farm 7h on my day off instead. This is true for all vanilla content. Except for raids i guess where you can miss out on loot from a week. I look forward to to play every class and im by no means an altoholic. I never play more thsn one character in retail. But leveling is fun in classic. Not the leveling per se but gearing your character while leveling gives you a taste of endgame IMO. For instance if you play a melee class you wanna farm an awrsome weapon from a dungeons and it feels great to have it and use it then for a while. The gearing process is completely absent from retail. I wont play all characters at 60 but i'll probably play 2 and the other ones i will level up. Not gonna rush like my first character but rather level them all up at the same time more or less. Doing more dungeons instead of questd, benefiting from rested XP and stuff like that.
---
They clearly was not cut out for WPVP then.
---
Wonder why they joined a PVP server for?
---
I can't imagine how a difference like that in healer will shave 5 minutes off a golem run
---
I woulda bought a nice car irl from that rort
---
Wait is 'high pop' now considered dead?
---
I never thunderclapped once, but thanks for not watching!
---
So, let's say you have a million players. And let's say you're perfectly typical. That's a million tickets every 1.5 years. That's around two thousand tickets per day.
---
Assuming the customer service grunts can handle on average 100 tickets per day (That's around one every 5 minutes) you're going to hire about twenty customer service grunts to handle things.
---
You know what happens when you issue a banwave? The amount of tickets spikes massively. You're going to get thousands of tickets on top of your regular tickets, and frankly people appealing bans are going to get lower priority than other kinds of tickets; just because the company is going to trust its algorithms or GMs unless it's given good reason to.
---
You can't just hire some extra customer service grunts to deal with it either, because you need to train them; and by the time you're done training them the need to have them on board no longer exists.
---
This 7 runs 4 shoulder 3 axes 0 helms.
---
Druids are the true tanks, warriors are just memeclasses by now.
---
Or the "dude, you were supposed to heal me", after the tank who rushed in dies to the boss because he did not care to pull out the random adds first.   
---
Sorry to dissappoint, but it's hard to cast when you are getting hit by 3 adds and the tnak is to busy DPSing to take aggro off you =)
---
Only for Horde though
---
At 41 if you haven‚Äôt done it yet, there are a few swamp of sorrows quests you can do. You‚Äôre also of a level to get through Badlands. If you do the Study of the elements chain, bring some bronze patterned bracers and get to level 42 to complete it to get a trinket. You can grind the elementals here for elemental earth as well. 
---
Normally at 42 you also do the higher level part of STV, but if this is too wild on a pvp server then you can try heading to Feralas early. Do the lower level quests and grind out 3-4 levels on the naga here. They are good xp and die easily.
---
You get him at level 10, until then it's not really diffucult either imo
---
Ah yes. That's totally the only complaint. Good job. You nailed it.
---
You don't raid cities for honor btw lmfao, terrible idea.
---
Gravestone scepter, blackfathom deeps quest
---
Yeah better off spending gold on.....?
---
how is using illegal labor instead of registered ones a problem, the only difference is that the state doesn't get its cut
---
how is buying stuff on illegal black markets a problem, the only difference is that the companies don't get their cut
---
The problem with goldbuying in videogames is that it facilitates botting, account stealing, credit card fraud etc.... and loads of measures to make it harder for these shady people which makes games less enjoyable for the playerbase through a multitude of regulations/changes to gamemechanics
---
Idk about you but I encountered that same situation in classic. Couldnt do that rock ele quest because they were all dead, constantly, then the alli would call some higher level dudes to hold the area and it would just cause a war. I ended up grinding a ton of levels to hit 60 and even doing that was difficult unless you chose really piss poor mobs to grind, like typically completely player void areas have people fighting for mobs. Deadwind pass for example is a good enough spot to grind cloth, its not *ideal* but its good enough and theres **still** someone there all day everyday. The world isnt meant to hold 10k people. We really needed it capped at 3k or whatever the original cap is. Whenever someone says theyd go dead after a while, thats still on blizzard because theyre choosing to intentionally hold back what people want. We want the hk system, we want to bg. Holding it back for months is absurd.
---
3 weeks of doing the same shit every day? Its not that it takes too long but the process is boring IMO. Log in every day to do the same world quests? I'll pass.
---
So you want a lower population and worse time finding dungeons and LFG because of it. A sparse auction house with a frail economy. You want to deal with being server merged after 3 months because your server is dead and half the people quit because it's so sparse.
---
All of this to avoid what?  Not being able to see the other faction raid your city and defend?  Or maybe the instance issue that some tryhards took advantage of and got banned in the first couple weeks.  
---
So - good job - you fixed a very minor problem that 2% of the games population cares about and ruined the experience for 98% of the population with your 'ez soloshun'.
---
Now do Azuregos to Ironforge
---
Some of us want the tourist to leave so we dont have to keep dealing with queue times
---
Quality over quantity my brother
---
47 is half way
---
Mograine too. Agree 100%
---
Hi thanks.
---
I think most replies are still very relevant because if you read them (and my comments), I have no intention of raiding on my bear at the moment. Only levelling dungeons, so the whole bear offtank benefit doesn't apply to me.
---
I'm just looking to see if bear is enjoyable as a tank in its own respect in dungeons and all the replies say that they are perfectly fine, just perhaps the healer might find more issues with their mana healing me compared to if I was a warrior.
---
So in a game with millions of players, you let 5-10 bad apples spoil your fun?
---
And you want BFA players banned from Classic?
---
I'm sorry, but your'e an absolute moron, and out of touch with reality.
---
What amount of gold should you be at during the levels heading into 40?
---
I‚Äôm 37 with ~70g and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm behind the curve
---
Well I play on EU servers and the only guy I had issue with was a vanilla player that /w me "BFA noob" Return to retail" and so on after I asked a question.
---
Didn't play retail since MoP and played on vanilla Pserver the last 2 years...
---
Someone people are just jerks and that has nothing to do with the fact that they come from BFA or not
---
Every retail player I have played with has been delightful.
---
Shit weapon though
---
Oh, my bad. DEMO SHOUT. Everything else is right.
---
Do you know what lvl of fishing do you need for Steamweedle Port for successful catches?
---
Nobody is forcing you to play this game. If you don't like it, don't play it.
---
I despise aoe farming groups, they are by far the worst runs I have done as a war(tank with an actual shield). Any normal run with a rogue as been smooth. A good example is the last boss of Uldaman where a rogue helps immensely with the adds.
---
Don't talk like that about the Lights champions!
---
People who actually have no shield are terrible.
---
There was never a serious proponent of 2H or DPS tanknig that wouldn't tell everyone to switch to their shields once in a while.
---
I said I made over 100g in 3 days, not that I made enough money for my mount in 3 days. I made the 72 gold for my mount in one night and went to farm for tailoring money the other 2 nights.
---
I was also on Faerlina, which is the highest or second highest pop realm in the US. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many people are there if you tag the mob when it respawns
---
It's fun because you can tell these folks came straight from retail and try to play classic like it's retail.
---
They don't know the dungeons, they don't know their rotation, they don't realize you need a sword and board because you have more armor and that shit matters etc.
---
Befriend the tanks that do work for you. Once you have a few, try and group with them.
---
Do the same with healers and dps you like. Its easier to form non frusty groups that way. :)
---
many illegal things could let you quit your job, under the assumption that you never get caught and noones scams you while you are doing business in the shady areas
---
Half of my guild (70+) I started at launch havent logged in for two weeks or theyre playing different chars
---
I‚Äôm going to need a little more background. 11 million? Or 1 million? Even 100,000g is an incredible amount. And how exactly did he achieve this, specifically? That type of hoarding of gold would do wonders to the economy if what you‚Äôre saying is true.
---
Ash, housewares.
---
Guess I shouldnt have wrote about the dark Tower if Im not finished with the series lol
---
100%, Alts are great in classic. While it takes a little time to get to 60, its not impossible. Also you can max out professions easily as you have a main to fund it, and can do runs to get items to help max out your profession on an alt. 
---
I was a total altaholic back in vanilla, and have my main hunter, and levelled a priest, shammy, warrior, rogue and druid all to 60. Some of them I didnt play much once 60, but loved playing them.  I loved the rested XP, and would play the alts till I used up the rested xp, or finished a zone, then move to another alt. 
---
My main is a herber and skinner, but will be going herbing/alch soon, when I get to level 60 in a few weeks.  I have an alt enchanter to DE stuff for me and to get mats. I might get another alt to be a skinner / LWer to make stuff to DE for mats.
---
Jesus, why does everyone in classic have this obsession over tanks needing to pull one mob at a time and having a shield? It's slow as hell and it's piss-boring. If your healer isnt braindamaged then theres no problem healing a full dps group with a 2 handed warrior tank, heck, you don't even need a tank. Dungeons in classic are truly a joke.
---
My mate has done 20+ runs and no shoulders. RNGesus is not with you peeps
---
&gt;Dishonorable kills are a part of the Honor System. You gain DKs by killing opposing-faction Civilians [NPC](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/NPC) during PvP combat. DKs can quickly lower your PVP Rank.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Dishonorable kills were added to the game in an effort to stop high level players camping quest NPCs or vendors without penalty, as this could become a major source of grief for lower level players on older servers.
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dishonorable\_Kill](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dishonorable_Kill) 
---
apparently it was only in the game for a very short amount of time and never included killing of grey level players
---
I play horde on Ashkandi and Alliance is actually the majority of the server. Ashkandi is busy as fuck on both sides.
---
BoE Epic = All Need      
---
basic rule of all pugs, unless agreed differently.. this druid is just salty af  
---
(advice for the druid: want a BoE epics to wear? run guild groups only)
---
Yeah I think in Vanilla when I got mine, my level 60 friend helped me with it, I used that thing until I got Mograine's Might at ~40
---
Speaking of nerf. 23 people shouldn't be able to do this.
---
I remember doing it in vanilla, but this was a time when UBRS was always 15 man, and School/Strath were 10
---
Go to Ashenvale and do the Warsong Supplies quest for a really nice blue quest reward, group up with some people to get the rope and oil if needed. Then you have the choice between Stonetalon Mountains (don't bother with the quests right at the border between Barrens/STM, those will be too low for your level) or Ashenvale - usually more PvP in Ashen. I'd recommend STM level-appropriate quests and then Ashenvale.
---
There's also the Blackfathom Deeps dungeon in the NW part of Ashenvale for your level - it rewards a very nice blue sword as a quest reward, might be worth doing even though you mention not wanting to dungeon all the way. RFK in Southern barrens is level 29+, can't quite recall what quest rewards there were for that one so probably nothing really excellent. Once you are 28/29 you can head on to Thousand Needles, follow with Shimmering Flats (ideally 30+, 31 is better) which is Skinner's paradise#1 if you happen to be one, and follow up with Stranglethorn Vale at around 32-33+, this is skinner's paradise #2 and you can basically live in this zone until level 43-44, if you run through the SM dungeons and RFD (you should, both have very nice weapon rewards from quests). 
---
That should keep you going for a while :) if you'd rather skip dungeons I'd say don't head to RFK, but the other ones give so good rewards that I would not recommend sitting out on them - those weapons will make your life, questing and grinding so much easier.
---
[No](https://www.google.com/search?q=inane&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS727US727&amp;oq=inane&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.1231j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)
---
I'll take a Paladin or Feral tank over warrior for nearly every single dungeon anyday, but most raids once a bit of gear flows through it's warrior almost every time if the option is there.
---
outside of warrior tank and priest heal, every other class is more or less needed on an equal part.
---
Druid bring innervation, battle rez and mark of the wild, warlock have his soulstone and summoning, paladins bring ton of blessings and really good mono heal, mages bring damages, water and such for everyone, shamans and their totems are loved, etc etc...
---
Im not gonna down play sul thraze, and thats a sweet ass enchant too. However im sorry to say the weapon is actually....pretty terrible for arms warriors. Its too fast to benefit from overpower or mortal strike. Im sure you'll be doing good dps still but....it's more of a paladin weapon since they can use their baseline seal that scales evenly with attack speed.
---
Congrats though I've always wanted one even on my warrior, its sexy as hell
---
This, if the people are smart they say "all need" so everybody has their chance to get the valueable item.
---
Some people are nice and say "oh I gonna write down your name and split the gold between everyone".
---
Well and some people are douchbags and say "THIS IS MY BIS ITEM YOU FCKS, WHY YOU ROLL ON MY ITEM".
---
I prefer the first 2 and accept if people got the item purely for getting gold.
---
And to you friend
---
I've experienced some behavior with layering when I've been questing, suddenly the weather changes, other nearby players disappear and several living mobs appear around me when seconds earlier there were none. Great way to die when you took a chance on an orange quest only because there were so many other players keeping the mob population under control...
---
As long as you don't raid with several toons, it's very alt friendly. Equipping multiple chars in raids at the same time lets you fall behind.
---
No dude, lifetap is important to do consistent damage. If you heal in classic you have to know that. I wont dumb down my own playstyle bc healers don't get that they don't need to heal me that often. It's not my fault that they dont understand an rage
---
that shit completely ruined any sense of belonging
---
well maybe you should re-roll a tank and level as a prot warrior if you want to play the game the way it should ;)
---
I get that there's a logical argument against it scaling, but is it 1.12 vanilla behavior? The linked comments indicate otherwise.
---
See also https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dark_Pact_(old): "The amount of mana transferred receives 96% of your +spellpower bonus", i.e. just like life tap. But I don't know if that was already the case in the patch we're playing, maybe someone here remembers.
---
I think it was around 20 minutes. I didn't time it. 
---
To be honest I think this is the longest route you can take. 
---
We were wondering with my friend, what was the longest possible flight path and everyone on forums said" Darnassus - Tanaris", but that's in case you have all flight masters explored. I wonder if there is one longer than this one I posted.
---
And his writeup is worse in every way to an already existing one.  Even just the pros and cons section is better than this whole write up.  If your goal is to convince people of something why wouldn't you use a superior resource?
---
I wouldn't say that everyone that hit 60 in close to 10 days /played by now has no job.
---
It is just that most people are simply casuals and true casuals play only a few hours per week. But this sub tends to think you are a casual if you "only" play 3 hours per day.
---
Well, deaths cost additional durability so if you don't want higher repair bills then you can wait until the healer isn't OOM. Win-win.
---
Hi, /u/ExplodingPigs

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9xa6s/do_you_think_a_developer_is_going_to_capitalize/). 
---
Isnt that actually bannable ? I Mean not the wording, but the translating stuff
---
HMm i never sit for more than 20 secs on our runs, 45 seems like you do something wrong.
---
Eastern Healthlands?
---
Well, there is only one solution: cry in chat louder that druid was ninjaing loot all the road and was unlucky to ninja this one. When you try to defend crowd would think your dude is guilty.
---
You can do loads of things:
---
- Do level 45+ quests as suggested.
---
- Fishing in Tanaris/Feralas/Aszhara for that squid and stonescale eels
---
- Mining thorium veins and arcane crystals in EPL/Winterspring/Silithus or mithril doing laps around entire Tanaris.
---
- Black lotus laps in EPL+chests
---
- Elemental Fire farming in Un'goro/Searing Gorge
---
- Crusader pattern farm, but usually contested and low drop chance...
---
- E'ko farm on the winterfall furbolgs near Everlook, this is usually the best with a nice raid group running in circles, it's what I did on pservers a lot, idk if people still do this
---
- If not with a group solo winterfall fire elixir farm
---
- Badlands with Elemental Earth and mining mithril there
---
And many more, one farm isn't as good as any other obviously, but killing bats in EPL for 50 straight hours isn't fun. Perhaps you want to chill in the forests of Feralas and cook up 5 stacks of Grilled Squid or you want to kill spiders in Searing Gorge in a big circle chasing your own respawns.
---
As a hunter i'll gladly take it. I have yet to meet a rogue or warrior willing to bow down a ranged weapon with stats.
---
You need to back your guildie unless evidence is provided. Druid needs to provide the information or its just a case of a player being butt hurt over not winning the loot. Screenshot the conversations with the Druid and if possible try get corroborating statements from the others in the group.
---
Some might not go here but since the Druid took matters to harass your guildie for following with what the majority of the group agreed to, I would try speak to the Druids GM about the actions of his guildie.
---
This is my first char ever on WOW, I just reached lvl 32. We were 3 friends of this level questing in stranglethorn, we never attacked anybody from the hord in the vicinity.  
---
Some people with "??" on their lvl and with mounts suddenly arrive, chase us for a good minute accross the forest to kill us and then camp the NPC where we had to deliver quests. Is it how PvP is supposed to be? I understand the concept, but I fail to see what they gain from killing people that don't even give them honor.
---
you can turn do special effects yes. Also i would add that wow is quite unimpressive in comparison to modern mmos such as FF XIV or GW2 who WILL completely wreck your friend. She should be fine even with "normal" wow outside of raids.
---
Yup. Super casual here. Only level 28. So I'll be resubbing. I only play in those rare instances when I'm not working and my wife isn't home.
---
I was still amazed by the fact that I was Max Level before the first raid Launch back then. So, could you give me a hint of how broken it was ? I used WA a lot in Legion (which was my first expac of commitment to the guild raids) and Im legit curious.
---
I don't support this kind of behavior. 
---
&gt; They are just too valuable to let someone have. 
---
Thats the way of a true ninja.
---
I'm fine if this is communicated before doing the dungeon but need is for equip and not for sell.
---
"pservers with classic-wow codes" bro gtfo you cannot fully recreate the experience you wish you had back then get the fuck over it jesus christ
---
&gt;A 44 warrior "arms tank". When two of us mentioned him having no shield
---
Allow me to point out that before 60, arms is actually the best tank spec for warriors, and it's very standard to use a 2h to speed things up until a shield becomes necessary for a large pull or a boss. It was done this way very often the first time through classic/BC/wrath too. I agree with your criticism of spellcleave (had a lock pull the entire pyramid event and expect us to somehow not wipe) but the thing the tank did wrong was watch too many streams, not build incorrectly.
---
Blew the horn and got echeyakee stolen by a party of two shaman as I approached them and asked them why
---
They said:
---
"We were here first!!!!"
---
It's from Avenue Q, so pretty much.
---
just merge servers when needed lol, its not that complicated
---
play as a hunter, all gear is hunter gear
---
Boutta clap some goblin cheeks ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
Tnak you, it's just Ansi UI Classic, though.
---
with close to no changes ;)
---
Pretty sure its been brought over from retail wow arena, many double caster dps/melee setups have been called X cleave since as long as I can remember. It's just now being used in dungeons too.
---
Is you succubus good right when you get it or only after you buy some talents? So far I found it rather underwhelming when I got it at level 20...
---
You want to sell on the AH items that have interesting stats like :
---
\- cloth with spirit/intel/stal
---
\- Leather with stam/agi/strenght or, to a lesser extend, intel
---
\- mail and plate with Stam/streng/agi
---
Those generally sell well at the AH
---
Item like Plate with +8stam and + 15 spirit is good to disenchant.
---
Mind that weapon sell for a good bunch of money but also have greater chance to give you shard and essence instead of dust when disenchanting.
---
My server is loaded with gankers on both sides.
---
I truly hope this is sarcasm ...
---
I don't remember any reservations in vanilla tbh...
---
Could you link your exact build please? I‚Äôm very interested.
---
I was accused of ninjaing green one handed axe yesterday :D from SM Armory :D and got kicked out of the group after saying "good job party leader".... He was toxic from the beggining, at the start he said that he is the master looter and reserves the Axe and Helmet, as he is party leader so he makes the rules. He also decided to tank (41lvl rogue) and after 3 pulls we wiped, our healer wrote "i dont like rogue tanking" and left, so i said good job party leader, he started accusing me of ninjaing in the previous run when in reality i asked if i can need as it is an upgrade for my tanking equip, nobody said anything so i needed. And he just kicked me :D
---
rogues and hunters dont counter mage. locks and spriests are
---
then again nothing can beat a geared lock and priests
---
They have completely different roles in competitive pvp.
---
I thought neutral was 30%
---
It was less common in vanilla. But for some items it was implied. (Mostly legendaries)
---
I killed her solo
---
Maybe it was a play on AWOL since they were on a roof/structure/wall? Still a stretch, and the completely wrong usage of AWOL. Just giving them the benefit of the doubt.
---
queues are down to just a few thousand with increased population caps AND layering! Obviously we would have dead servers /s
---
You just do the AFK stuff on OSRS on the side until you feel the classic burn out coming. Then you switch.
---
Tsm seems good!
---
I mean, its not literally making them bad. Its more that it offers a quick and easy alternative to actually playing the game, which would make people learn their class.
---
The Druid is in a guild that only consists of him, he also provided "witnesses". I asked my guildie immediately if he could recall any members in the group, he gave me some classes but couldn't remember names but would "Know if he saw them"
---
The player the accuser gave me as a witness was a Shaman, a class that the guildie didnt say was in the run and was also only level 48 (Still possible to go ST as 48, but unlikely)
---
Yes there is. What do you think happens when you aren't "legit"? No one buys your shit. Feedback and reputation is very important to the popular gold selling sites.
---
Nah, it's just the wannabe pros who have watched too many YouTube guides. You know, the type that thinks you have to be fully bis equipped to raid and that has to clear MC within 30 minutes within the next month. I don't think the reserving will last long.
---
Yeah it's pretty common and fucking hilarious.  I mean, look at my score on that comment fucking lol.
---
Many overemphasize the utility aspect (which is noteworthy on its own), but Shamans arguably provide the best raid healing through Chain Heal, which can be extremely efficient and fairly low on overhealing. The one drawback is that they need to stack a decent amount of mp5 to be able to throw out constant CHs, even when downranking.
---
The utility aspect is pretty insane, though. Mana Tide / Spring are very powerful, as is WF if you're put in the melee group.
---
Not any more than a spriest outside the spirit buff from discipline tree (which can be subsituted by a scroll). The only thing holy has over shadow is the 15% reduction for greater heal.
---
Haha jk guys
---
this is so fucking fake
---
Everyone in the group can benefit from selling the epic. You can sell the warden staff and buy a freezing band. It is common to roll need on all BoE epics and doesn't need to be communicated.
---
&gt;dishonorable kills suck
---
&gt;rogue
---
Mhmm, yes
---
That's the risk of human support. Humans make mistakes, it's whether they get remedied or not thats the important part.
---
Fair enough. I might not agree personally but I can respect those arguments!
---
Have you seen how yoked Torbjorn is?   Not in a million cycles.
---
You should visit the forums sometime. Or don't, you know, for your sanity.
---
Yep, welcome to PvP servers.
---
Tbh it‚Äôs a mixed bag as to what you‚Äôd expect in a contested zone. Sometimes the enemy faction will just mind their business and won‚Äôt bother you unless you bother them, other times you run into situations like the one you described.
---
The camping a quest npc thing is a little pathetic, especially for high level players, but it‚Äôs not unexpected.
---
Yes geddon and rag are fire immune. Fire elementals are immune, Garr and all golems have high fire resistance, golemagg, all giants and the snake bosses have low resistances while magmadar and all core hounds have 0.
---
Made one and got a 5g tip yesterday. Current AH prices on Mirage Raceway (EU) are like this:  
---
\- Thormium bar: 80s  
---
\- Arcanite Crystal: 39g  
---
\- Arcanite Bar: 41g  
---
So you barely make profit buying the mats and selling it in the auction house. Had luck someone tipped me 5g for the service.
---
Yeah, but what if they MC'd a paladin and brought with them ?
---
This is an ice cold take, I think u just frostbolt procced me
---
I don‚Äôt know. I do more damage tanking with my WW axe (32 warrior) but my healer ends up ooming waaay more. Sword and board (or axe and board) ends up with me doing less damage but the healer never has to drink. Threat isn‚Äôt too bad either with revenge procs happening more often.
---
Only because arms falls off, as does 2h fury once you douse yourself in hit gear.
---
At least you actually found a tank  :D
---
Never join a group that reserves items. I don't agree with reserving any items at all.
---
Classic is more alt friendly than main friendly, considering there isn't much endgame content
---
nah, it's really not.
---
it's not simple at all on the left, that's a clusterfuck of "what the fuck is going on" with the arrow (which starts at a place making it seem like you read from the start of the arrow then go around), the blobs of colour are too similar to distinguish at a glance (it would be better to just have labelled it with lines shooting out).
---
atleast he labelled the axis on the graph on the right though.
---
There was CCwatch back in the days, I have read somewhere that they will update it to classic but i haven't heard anymore since then :/
---
Third best tank, mostly due to tank itemization excluding axes for the most part.
---
Trolls are the best threat by a lot due to how helpful getting an early boost in haste is.
---
Tauren stamina is overrated but their big hitbox is also very useful.
---
If you want to be a true baller you roll undead for the most important racial: having animations I like.
---
fighting the good fight
---
Nonono Golden Pearls mate
---
a shaman could slap his totems on the ground then /dance during the entire fight and he would have done more than half of the entire raid.
---
No level 60 does, anyone can run there no problem.
---
He has an alliance main. The lvl 2 troll is his Neutral AH alt, and that is the one OP killed.
---
Do they even layer the cities? seems unnecessary
---
\#GoodGuyBlizzard
---
Yeah, blackcrow can sometimes be quite a bitch to farm, since not many people wanna run LBRS.
---
Get a warrior and a mage/lock then ask a healer friend if he'd be up for doing a couple Omogg / Shadow hunter runs. Can also do Vosh. Takes 20-25 min ish per run. Casters all need the Omokk legs, and you can give gems to those that want them as an incentive to join.
---
Lost Savage Gladiator Chain to a hunter yesterday. Tilted me quite a lot, considering he will probably just sell it after his first MC run, but I get why he needed on it.
---
I always take screenshots of the rolls, as well as group conversation during the time.  To defend myself when I win stuff.. has come.in handy twice now against false ninja claims.
---
&gt; Do you think it had anything to do with the fact your other post blew up and made them look really bad? Lol
---
Nah mate ofcourse not. (Ofcourse the only good thing about social media is being able to use it to smackdown bad service from companies)
---
You and your guildie don't seem toxic or ninjas. However I have noticed the game is very greed orientated. A Warden staff is a druids bis I believe. I would never dream of wanting it to sell on cause I'm not thick. If no druid in group then sure that's completely fair. Currently everyone is encouraging everyone to roll need on all BOE... this totally shafts me as a tailorer looking for the archmage recipe and has once. Truefaith recipe dropped last night and whole group passed and priest was ecstatic and grateful. Seeing people happy is nice, but unfortunately becoming less of a sight these days.
---
I took the staff...
---
Got to level 39 as a Holy Paladin. Killing shit is horribly slow because I'm spec'd into Holy. Can't switch to Ret only because never get dungeon invites, can't stay only Holy because killing things too slowly. Oh the humanity.
---
I feel so bad when i win all the rolls, so i end up passing on some items later in the run so the others also get something from the run.
---
I also pass if its a minor update for me but major for someone else unless its a BiS piece.
---
Chronometer. Not sure there is a 1.13 version yet.
---
`Great job !!`
---
&gt;In Vanilla, communicating with the other faction was actually against TOS and was bannable. 
---
That is the first time I heard of this.
---
The puns are unbearable
---
Dude, I like your wording.
---
I love my lock. It's one of those easy to learn difficult to master classes.
---
Well the funny part about it was most of the wipes were on the banshee boss.  One due to not prepopping my aoe fear which feared everyone into mobs.  Another we were melee heavy and my group couldnt kill me and shaman while kiting me ran into mobs (again tired issue).  Last wipe was on Baron since we didnt have aoe and forgot about holy waters.
---
Even better is when I make the group, and people pm me with their ~~retarded questions~~ demands. My reply in this case is usually asking them to join, and let everyone know what they want because I'm not reserving anything for anyone, and I'm also not anyone's messenger.
---
Wall jumping isn‚Äôt even in the game.
---
We're still rare on retail but it got around that troll is the woke pve tank race on horde so I see a *lot* of troll warriors on classic
---
was questing with a friend besides 2 allys. after we were done and wanted to leave the asshole mage from some time ago came back. ofc we wanted to kill him, but that coward fled to the other 2 allys. we looked at each other, pally healed the mage and then they wanted to 3v2 us. smoked them all and camped the shit out of them. you had your chance allys, we were friendly, but you thought you could kill us with a numbers advantage
---
honestly i like to level in peace and wpvp after im max level, but i couldnt even reach lvl 40 without being tilted to the max, now every single one needs to die. your 20 levels below me? die. your 20 levels above me? die. there is no honor in this, only death
---
Once she catches up to you just shield up and hope her aoe triggers before her windfury hits also make sure to run alongside the walls of the cave and have minor speed enchant on boots
---
Gz on the kill and thank you for helping me with the warlock quest at Tabetha on the way to Ony ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
haha xD cheers!
---
I mean, they don't really compare in pvp because they have completely different roles. 
---
In terms of simply killing other players rogue will scale better with gear than a druid will but druids can obviously do a lot more than that.
---
A group of 5 did it back in the day.
---
What's the point of this? Boring af
---
Think I'll be giving it a break until BGs. Feels kind of like being drip fed right now and really only logging for 1 or 2 set pieces from mc,ony.
---
that is not entirely true, there is no case you can kill a mob with %90ish hp-mana left if you are not wand spamming, which is something you shall not do after 38+
---
60 warlock here
---
Sounds more like the boring leveling experience isn't for everyone.
---
warlocks can talk cross faction if they curse eachother with curse of tongues
---
Haha, animated maybe not. But a Comic Book is more possible.
---
I guess, if you really want to play on a pvp server, try to find some areas that are less populated. At your level, you can grind in desolace, arathi, 1k needles (shimmering flats).
---
You can also try hitting up scarlet monastery, staying there until you hit like 40-42.
---
I'd steer clear of stv, like, forever..
---
I rolled a pve server this time, still feeling leveling is slow, since the quest mobs are not available at times.
---
Do you know 2 accounts
---
Berserker rage
---
Auto running will be interrupted by Distract spell.  You get distracted , your movement will stop.
---
So I think the Undead might be using a keyboard script or just keep his keyboard pressed with weight.
---
Because your other stupid post blew up and probably caused a lot of grief towards that GM that was just trying to do his job that should probably done by several other people as well, but since Blizz fired most of their GM's that isn't possible. The crusade that ensued after that post got you a free month of game time, so congrats!
---
Spellcleave players are the worst. This sub likes to pretend that spellcleavers r being told how to play and make all these posts saying "don't tell me how to play!!!" (no one was... We just think ur dumb af)
---
But in reality, it's the spellcleave players who force their shitty gameplay on others. The amount of times I've been in dungeon pugs and the mage just randomly decides it's gonna be an aoe spam run even though no one signed duo for that is way too much! Spellcleave players will literally berate u and insult unless you play their way and I'm really sick of it.
---
This sub needs to get its shit together and stop pretending like spellcleavers r some "uwu poor me I'm misunderstood" types: they're the "I think I'm better than everyone and if u don't adhere to how I want to play fuck u!" types
---
Thank Sn1p-Sn4p for this
---
Unlikely.
---
Twelve year olds know better than this.

What  great world first.

You can a make a world first post about every trivial lucky achievement.

Hi, /u/Rhystic99

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9xg85/is_the_success_of_classic_classic_being_good_or/). 
---
Face the might of Mograine!
---
It's not, you can't have any meaningful discussion with it.
---
Did you mean 44.01? Because I'm pretty sure that's halfway.
---
Mostly yes. I really do like to talk with people. World feels big and living. I also really love all RPG elements like class quests etc. Only negative is that I hate how so many people just want to kinda "abuse" things that didn't exists in Vanilla times. There is tons of groups who are just doing cleave (spellcleave, meleecleave). Sure it would've been possible back in days but it wasn't such big thing as it is now. This makes it harder to find groups for dungeons for classes that do not support this cleave meta. Also I really hate how people yell layer invites all the time. Being in big guild it means that every 5 minutes someone wants to get layer invite.
---
But mostly I have been happy and satisfied. Game is actually really relaxing to play because it is so slow paced. Playing in retail feels sometimes like playing piano with all those procs and short cool downs. I really like that my rotation is more simple and pace of game is slowed down.
---
Yeah, orc warrior with axes (so I head) is the best dps combo of any class/race in the game in classic
---
I would have just ignored that guy. Random accusations without proof should never be something one should concern themselves with.
---
If he keeps harassing people just report him. End of story.
---
Tho, one thing:
---
&gt;Group was running Sunken Temple with a Druid Tank and the Warden Staff dropped. 4 of the people in the group decided EVERYONE should need the item, the druid tank did not like this and wanted the item as it's his BiS. The group decided everyone needed the gold and everyone would Need roll.
---
This is why the group leader should ALWAYS clarify the loot rules BEFORE the run.
---
I played with a guy who was a bear tank in vanilla, he was the first person I knew to get 10k hp, was tanking in naxx40 when it was new content. I don't think it's new, they just aren't as good but that doesn't matter.
---
Try CCP. They [made a video](https://youtu.be/S5xvkAPXB9c) telling someone to HTFU.
---
I have it installed and follow it about 20% of the time. I‚Äôve noticed people literally auto-pilot and will sit on the arrow waiting for spawn only killing in a 30y radius while the mobs they need spawn all over the zone.
---
I find this hilarious, really optimizing the time there.
---
Have you always been a cunt? Or was it a fairly recent transition?
---
Dps warrior on horde side are always orc. Tanks are trolls.
---
black mageweave
---
Only if you're not using the Ravager in your bags.
---
I did this yesterday lol. I stood there for far too long considering I've done that quest several times before
---
No queues anymore on EU servers, and even on most populated there are times when only one layer is present
---
Will Druid have a viable role. Even FCing all the way into late xpac?
---
I rolled a Druid
---
Sounds like you made the call when you chose 3 months.
---
As a Dom, this triggers me slightly üòÄ
---
I can relate to that. 100 things to do but none of them feel meaningful. Meanwhile in classic its grinding xp, farming gold or leveling professions. All of which feel desirable.
---
With the current cleave meta, I'd pick a druid tank over a 2h-warrior tank any day !
---
At least the bear has the armor and HP to compensate for not using a freaking shield.
---
Yeah it's pretty brutal. Almost not worth listing anything!
---
Go check bowhead for other transmuted that might be useful
---
It‚Äôs really not that big of a deal.  You can simply walk away from the roof.
---
Worst case scenario:  You die a single time and then res out of range of the roof.  The graveyard in Gadgetzan is about 10 seconds away.  Booty Bay, maybe 20 seconds.
---
This is about the most mild case of ‚Äúgriefing‚Äù I can possibly imagine.
---
STV is basically the main warzone of the whole game. In there, anything goes. I usually avoid questing there and just go back at end game to fight other 60's who are hunting lowbies.
---
A group of only priests did it
---
see to be honest, nobody is really gonna care about an item dropping in a lower level instances. The other guys is pissed cos he didnt win it.
---
Looks correct to me. I play mage XD.
---
I like to imagine how these people live their lives IRL. Suddenly their flaming does not face me. Being good at wow is the highlight in their life. Let them have that.
---
Lol! &lt;3
---
How long are the queues on the full servers?
---
Youre playing with bad warriors. Theyre objectivly the fastest and best tanks at 60
---
The slow weapons thing is for arms. Fury 2h doesn't rely on the damage range nearly as much since their core ability (bloodthirst) is based on attack power. Mortal strike is based off the weapon's damage.
---
Because in Vanilla gold buying was the reason it took me 5 times longer to get materials for anything end game. Although it was good to get in before the gold farmer and then have them kill my tagged mob.
---
I think most people that subbed early to reserve names knew what they would get
---
Ah, Thanks! I wasn‚Äôt sure of the group comp, just knew it happened! Haha.
---
It‚Äôs currently not possible via addons because the command is protected. This addon is what you are looking for though as soon as they lift the block:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/letmecast
---
You're fine. I was around the same and ended up with 120 come mount time. Herb/skinning so results may vary.
---
That‚Äôs a good watch. Thank you!!
---
Arcane crystals on my server are like 22 gold :|
---
Warriors can't afford frequent use of shield block until they're at least dying a little bit.
---
I judge by how fast their hp falls.. and paladins are the worst.. THAT is a fact because I can see the fucking HP myself.
---
Druids seem to be the best, with warriors close second.
---
I still think it is cute how many people have a hard on for "pre raid bis". You don't fucking need to be BiS to raid.
---
I haven't tested it on classic, but TSM does in retail so I'm assuming it does in classic as well.
---
Quest run best run. I prefer quest runs even in BRD, even if it takes 6 hours.
---
I bought 45 days of game time for gold with this idea in mind, just before classic release. I only touched osrs to deposit all my items just in case it gets compromised. I'll be back though.
---
More servers might have helped a bit, but players will also gravitate toward high pop servers. Unlike when wow released there were 60 thousand people etc and it climbed over the months and they gradually added servers. Now you've millions wanting to play straight away.
---
Killing someone from a roof doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin‚Äù anyone‚Äôs gameplay, lol.  The absolute state of carebears.
---
And you need to learn how to read. I said i agreed to some extent. Before resorting to name-calling at least learn how to read.
---
Read the last part of my comment. Also what the hell is a "fast" tank?
---
Bullshit lol, there are still 2k-5k queues on Gehennas, Firemaw, Golemagg and Shazzrah @ primetime. Ive never seen firemaw down to one layer.
---
It‚Äôs was either that song or the great mighty poo.
---
Swipe damage is low. And good gear with +STR is hard to get (because classic is like that). So you do generate treat, and probably will be able to "swipe" multiply enemies so they won't aggro on a healer, but you can't keep aggro if someone start to aoe. You must support swipe with mauls and this is doable, but not much easier than for warriors. IMO.
---
Smoother rage gen for warriors too. Having to wait almost 4 secs only to have a miss/parry/dodge sucks ass
---
People like mages for dps, they take a bunch to raids and they're the only class I see people asking for specifically in dungeons. Possibly due to the spell cleave meta, but they're still the biggest dps
---
Should have named yourself Skinja if you're going for pro moves like that.
---
If you are 60 and farm princess maybe. I guess mages can farm more than that
---
Wait good idea. As a healer I should set Details to show damage taken. Thanks!
---
I recently burned out on my current character and so I've decided to move on to a new class. One thing I heard is that in contrast to retail you are playing a class, not a spec, so you are not a Holy Paladin or a Feral Druid, you are a Paladin or Druid with everything that entails. This removed some options for me like the druid, rogue, warlock, hunter, and priest. I'm hoping that from the remaining options I can find something that fits my goals - so I was hoping for some advice. 
---
Firstly, I don't mind what role I play. Whilst I generally prefer to play solo in solo content I love playing group content and I'm happy to play at range or in melee, as a tank, healer, or dps, it doesn't matter so long as what I am doing doesn't clash with the fantasy I try and form for myself - i.e I don't want to be a holy priest and suddenly start blasting people with shadow magic. The second thing worth mentioning is that I love PvP, it's my favourite thing in any MMO and raiding is always second to it. I love raiding too though, I want to raid, but whatever decision I make ultimately puts PvP as the priority. 
---
With this all in mind, can anyone recommend me a class?
---
started this toon 1 day after release so took me exactly 1 month to hit 60
---
that sounds usefull :D  time to make some alliance friends
---
afk magic trees while i spam BRD for that fucking god forsaken trinket
---
General rule with a few exceptions:
---
* If you need 1 drop of a named NPC it drops for everyone
---
* If you need multiple drops of "regular" npcs they're not shared
---
* If you need 1 drop of "regular" npcs it can go either way.
---
It's so good, most priests in my guild have taken tailoring exclusively for this, and then they all change profession once they craft it.
---
It's not. High weapon damage is the most important factor for arms warriors and slow weapons have higher damage ranges than faster weapons with the same weapon dps. If you're making a large jump in weapon quality, like to sul'thraze when a lot of warriors are still using the ww axe in the mid 40s, sometimes a fast weapon still has a better damage range than your old weapon.
---
Nugrunning
---
For me it was the valor shoulders and the drac deflector.
---
Damn i did so many runs its not even fun.
---
I suspect it‚Äôs because of automation gone wrong.  In vanilla you couldn‚Äôt even report someone on the opposite faction, to prevent people from abusing the report system against people who killed them in PvP (ie, what people do in classic).
---
Damn, I rolled a Tauren for the hp
---
That very well might be the case.
---
I've found that some quests have a low rate, single quest item drop that's lootable by the whole party. I think the distinction is whether you need one of something or many, usually
---
yOu'Re
---
My server somehow has nothing of the bad behavior that gets constantly complained about here. Like cleave groups or Layering abuse spam.
---
seriously this post is so petty you get classic and youre already asking for a way out, sit down and shut up! "- wished that bfa players would be banned from playing classic-wow" &lt; **hard to read after this**, how fucking entitled must you be. also your mom doesnt count as one of the "**other people**" who've agreed with you, stfu and get 60 sheesh not even p2 yet.
---
Yes, you'll need to drink inbetween pulls, but that doesn't mean your entire group have to afk. If you're a healer you simply walk forward to the next pack while your group is fighting the current pack and then u sit down to drink as soon as you leave combat, by the time the rest of your group reach the other mobs you're already at half mana and can continue to drink till your tank is at 30-40% hp.
---
The level of filth, anger issues, drinking problem... you're one big fucking mess. How can you even post this without feeling embarressed about the fungus living on your walls and carpet? Some people are truly fucked up
---
Buddy... You misspelled your name.. :/
---
There is a way in the options, can't remember where it was though.
---
Can you imagine having to go back to the place where it died every time or face never having that pet again?
---
That's been my idea for a guild lately, first and foremost a guild that makes a point to take specs that wouldn't normally be taken on raids, and secondarily sets up shit like all priest or all druid raids, and super weird premades for bgs
---
5-10 bad apples? Those were the goldbuying / powerlvling people. I mentioned the community as well. it's more than 5-10 people.. Thank you for name-calling me when you've clearly not read my entire post.
---
Exactly. People complaining about PvP after not choosing the option to avoid the very thing they are complaining about in rolling on a PvE realm baffles me. A choice directly left up to the player and people still find a way to complain.
---
Did you kill him in the first place? Haha
---
I don't agree with layering as a solution, but I don't know what is a solution. More servers wouldn't solve it I don't think. I imagine Blizz are sitting in their office thinking "fuck". There's no way they can do p2 without layering
---
Exactly. Literally all of my normal runs go super well and all of the fast aoe spam ones are terrible. Call it anecdotal, but when there's a pattern there's a pattern.
---
every piece of +heal, talent, BoL and if mage available Amplify Magic.
---
&gt;Too much BfA mentality has come and too many players only play for them-selves and not for their guild or the community.
---
This isn't "BfA mentality". It was always like that on official realms.
---
You need to understand that the community on pservers was different than from the actual vanilla servers.
---
&gt;  It is common to roll need on all BoE epics 
---
Judging from all those people the last few weeks throwing the term ninja looter arround i would say its not common. 
---
&gt; Everyone in the group can benefit from selling the epic. 
---
I can benefit from selling every item even BoP to vendors. If BoE or BoP both times I roll need to sell, if for 100 gold or only for 5 gold at a vendor.
---
Im on the same boat when it comes to items worth much gold but many many players don't accept this so pressing 1 button that says BoE = All need at the beginning through macro isn't that hard to prevent ninja callouts like this
---
Fury doesn't have much value on weapon damage range which is why they can dual wield. It is good for 2h fury.
---
True. And funny. Loved reading this
---
I totally agree with you. I was recently asked when I joined a ZF group, if I wanted the staff. I said yeah if it drops and they kicked me before we even started saying "sorry two folk already reserved that".  I just laughed and said no worries. 
---
I can understand folk wanting BiS stuff, but you shouldnt be able to reserve anything in a pug! if you cant get guildies or mates to help you, then you take your chances. 
---
Either that, or set up your own group where you are the only 1 competing for said item. But you cant tell folk they cant roll on something.
---
Show us on the doll where the Alienware touched you
---
He sells the accounts probably. Or just for fun ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I would love to see a druid tank emperor. I bet their health doesn't drop from full to 10% in 3 seconds like for warriors, there.
---
Only if you are holy, if you go prot or ret you have Reckoning (spell batching sit ftw) or SoC which both scale much better with slower attack speeds
---
soulbound or not all items can be sold at vendors for a small amount of gold.
---
I'm happy for you, i wish i had the same experience on Mirage.
---

---
Orc Warlock. That increased pet damage is actually very nice.
---
With the amount of images competing for an entry, let alone loot, that beat you to 60
---
...that's just mean
---
Well.. you removed 5 classes from your options so that leaves you with paladin, shaman, warrior and mage.
---
All are fine in PvP in their own regard, Mage ultimately being the best out of all of them, so i'd say that.
---
This is how most sane people interpret the situation.  They walk away from the roof and move on with their day, or they find a way up to the roof and fight back.
---
There is a small contingent of vocal whiners who die repeatedly, report the ‚Äúgriefers‚Äù, and complain on various forums.
---
One that doesnt need to drink the shitty lvl 45 mage water for 2 minutes every pull
---
When done right, achievements are a way to encourage people to do content that they otherwise might not. Of course, a lot of games just include achievements to fill a checklist of things a game has to have nowadays; and those kind of suck.
---
Ah, a retail tank, no longer in their natural habitat, struggles to survive.
---
I sold all my excess Green Hills of Stranglethorn and Tanaris Map Fragments on there while leveing, gave me some decent pocket money, if nothing else.
---
No need to apologize - I did not mean to correct you, only further elaborate on how easy Ony is
---
It's really not that big of a difference.  1% and what 0.2% dodge?
---
That warrior arms tank is definitely not the problem in your group. Ita not that a streamer did it...literally everyone has to do it to keep aggro and to be able to do quests outside of a group. Your arms warrior was 44, which means he barely did any damage due to bad hit chance. Combine that with the insane amount of damage mages rogues and warlocks deal and the fact that you probably didnt even let him build aggro to begin with and its your fault he couldnt keep it. Hr mightve also under utilized Whirlwind, which is amazing to use in ZF but ultimately that very same warrior wouldve been just fine if he wasnt lower level than every mob in the dungeon.
---
2h tanking is not what streamers do, it is what every sane warrior does.
---
Speccing prot on lvl 44 forces you to do nothing but run dungeons all day every day for 15 levels.
---
He sap'd the Hunter then used blind on the pet.
---
6 month, and they didn't even have to bribe me with a flying ship or a free version of Diablo.
---
r/nothingeverhappens
---
All really sound advice. I would add that people are eager to share their insight if you do group with people. Don‚Äôt be shy to ask questions.
---
If your goal is to reach 60 as fast as possible, you won't level professions until 60 anyway.
---
Sure, you can start grinding pre bis at ~58, some earlier than that but most efficient is still to just grind to 60 first.
---
So no, 1-59 doesn't really matter much at all in the end.
---
"Plus I mean it really matters that you have fun. And well classic leveling is that."
---
That's a subjective opinion, you might think it's fun while some hate it and think the fun starts at level 60.
---
hey i was also top dps on the boss for mage and there where 60s
---
Nice copy from wowhead lol.
---
Are you alliance or horde?
---
6.5% for raid boss
---
Well shit.  Wonder how much Reddit helped :P
---
seen people afk running against torches, I think that works. Might be wrong though.
---
I've only ever played retail during tbc and leveled a toon to 70 and did some Kara, some pvp, but not much more.
---
I've played for.. over 5k hours on private servers, mostly blizzlike.
---
I was expecting this experience to be quite the same some of the blizzlike servers, but I think it's better.
---
Got to level 38.5, farmed the mount gold by skinning and fishing, did some dungeoning, found a nice guild, played around 5 days or so, only because I coincidentally had a 3 week vacation. 
---
Got skinning to 225, dropped for alch now. 
---
Got herbalism to \~215.
---
Got fishing to \~210. 
---
Got first aid to 235 or so. 
---
Got cooking to around 240 too. 
---
The last few days have been a grind for the mount. Not that I have 93 gold to my name and honored to my faction, gonna restart the leveling process.
---
Hope to get to 50+ by the end of next month, get all my professions to 300 or close and keep having a blast.
---
I got my mount at like lvl 47 or something although that was with some wasted gold from enchanting and respecs
---
Orbs reserved/Dark Runes reserved was frequent same as Epic drops. 
---
But stuff like "all tank gear reserved - need tank"  or "We farm boss that only drops melee loot - looking for healer and casters" was rare I believe.
---
Youre mad because some people bought mounts, and blizzard aint banning them fast enough. I dont see how that is gonna ruin your fun. 
---
The game and community aint the same, because you grew up. 
---
If you aint having fun, dont play the game. 
---
Dont start blaming the smallest wierdest things you can come up with.
---
my guild of mommys and dudes who had jobs did it with 32 in 2005. we sucked, but were also awesome. basically 10 manned it tbh
---
You had me in the first half, bit gonna lie
---
Horde
---
At least he tells you, i‚Äôd just do it between pulls and blame a pet if anything went wrong.
---
It's one day, you'll live.
---
Tier 4 sounds like an assassin.
---
This man. He is a problem for the people. He is your target. Go quickly komrade
---
Could you elaborate?
---
Bear witness to the puns
---
Sure it does, but to a lesser extent than retail's inflation.  Largely because of there being significant gold sinks in classic (like respec costs, epic mount, boe epics, raiding consumables, alts etc).
---
call the wartard out, post screenshots
---
&gt; It is not a violation of ToS to cross faction collude on classic wow. 
---
Huh, I guess it's been changed with the introduction of the "new" Classic WoW, because it definitely *was* against the ToS back when vanilla was active. Source: https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8
---
Guess it was changed when they added the possibility to have characters of both factions on the same account and server years ago.
---
it is 1 day but im saying this system is flawed for classic
---
LMFAO YOU PUT CRUSADER ON THAT POS. HAHAHAHA
---
Pretty sure it's a carry over from wow arena composition names, most of those are named X Cleave.
---
Some people did use Shadowblade in the 49 bracket, it was far more common to see the 48 scout blade, 40 Gutripper or 47 Widowmaker though due to their 1.7, 1.8 + 1.9 AS respectively, thus higher DMG ranges for backstabs / ambush.
---
Wouldn't hurt to look into BiS lists for 49 rogues, as enough people will follow them that if it's in there you'd be better of holding on till phase 2+.
---
Ah so manly gear, makes sense. Man thats awesome, my holy light crit for 2.8k at most, so still a long way to go :)
---
I will kill as many flight masters and escort npc as I want. Idc about some shitty rank.
---
Thank you :)
---
Can I ask what the addon is to display the party like that?
---
no, thank you!
---
Yup. There's always one fucking mage who just decides how the run is gonna go. Literally had a mage try to do an aoe spam run when it was a pally, 2 rogues and a warrior
---
Roll an alt lol
---
cheers!
---
&gt;My main is 39 and I don't think its worth it to reroll
---
Oh sonny boy youre maybe a third of the way to 60 lol
---
How the fuck are they criticial to the games health? You can't just pad out that little content without people giving up in between. If you aren't a hardcore open world PvP fan you have NOTHING to do in p2. And p3 will also be cleared in under a week for most "serious" PvE players.
---
You can't drag this shit out for two years without people quitting left and right.
---
I don't see a test. I see people who never played classic quitting. The same type of people who think what's happening in retail is okay. Everyone else who has played classic before is still logging on in my personal experience
---
Less than 1% of players are on realm discord. Blacklist is a joke of a concept in a post-forum age.
---
Would wear cadaverous. Better than shadowcraft and the other belt (if youve enough crit for soft cap)
---
Water lasts 20 seconds but ok
---
Yes but It usually benefits more from slow weapons.
---
I‚Äôm a noob to classic (44 rogue atm) but I‚Äôm confused because in certain runs with tanks that seem to know what they‚Äôre doing I can absolutely unload on the mobs and never have more than one hitting me back, which isn‚Äôt a problem of course. But in runs with less proficient tanks (most of them unfortunately) the tanks can‚Äôt seem to keep aggro off the healers and the healers usually die first.
---
taunt is melee range in classic though so I feel like the pet has to already be attacking you anyway for this to work
---
Then [this addon Leatrix Maps](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-maps-classic) might be for you.
---
In its description is says, among others:
---
&gt; zoom in and out of the map, prevent the zoom level resetting when opening the map and **enlarge the player arrow**.  All settings are optional.
---
This is just an excerpt but I think that's what you want, no?
---
Ok, so the hardcore players that knows how to play the game most efficiently farmed pre bis in instances up to level 60. Good to know.
---
Personally I would probably go Cadaverous, but I would be looking to try and get a Cloudrunners belt, it'll give slightly less AP than Cadaverous but it gives the 0.75% crit (or something like that) too
---
Sure, I will just let my boss know that a game I play is dead during nights so I can't work my normal hours anymore.
---
Grats bud. I'm working on the breastplate of bloodthirst myself but it's looking like I'll have to find some alternative. Managed to get the skinning dagger for the beast but who knows what the drop rate is for the pristine hide because all I've seen is thick leather for 10+ runs. Since I've just pugged it I've been lucky to even skin the thing but as time goes on more people get the dagger which means more people rolling for the hide. 
---
Probably going to have to settle for the warbear harness I have at the moment.
---
Invest in bags, dont get all the skills if you dont need em for now. Gold management very important in the beginning. :) also sometimes cheaper for buying mats and let someone craft bags
---
Aye, but I don't want to be a priest.
---
no monk class in classic
---
?? You got nipple wrong, need to do that for all mobs man.
---
You can get weapon skill from items, Berserking not so much
---
I mean, what is a mage without crits that make him cum all over his desk, right?
---
Grind reps (you'll need exalted Argent Dawn for naxx), raise secondary professions, start an alt, gather mats for end game consumables,.....there is plenty to do
---
Classic got walls though
---
!remindme 1 day
---
Pfft, not even close to 99 /Runescape
---
I did the quest with a friend of mine so i had a spare horn.
---
let some ally hunters get their beloved pet. 
---
i know i'm gonna pay for this one day. 
---
Anyway,  your bf is a lucky one! i tried to let my wife play but she didnt get hooked up. 
---
keep on playing and don't worry about anything, u are just making him happy.
---
I dont think there was enough time for anyone to make that much money until tbc.
---
Current content is very undertuned. The fact you can't mitigate crushing blows and you don't have scaling gear the way warriors do will make each tier harder to clear than the last. Bot saying its impossible, because it isn't, just know it will get difficult.
---
Druids and hunters are very similiar in that they don't scale well into later content but they are monsters early on.
---
Yetis are skinnable humanoids
---
I've seem pretty consistent drop rates for this loot table.  Some get unlucky.
---
Would like to know aswell
---
You can‚Äôt skin moonkin in PvE it PvP (sadly)
---
Bud...admit your mistake and move on. The system is designed to do exactly what it did.
---
1.) You spammed (unintentionally or not)
---
2.) You were Reported
---
3.) You were Chat Banned
---
Not being able to Chat for ONE day over an error on your own part and then complaining that you‚Äôre the victim of your own making....move on.
---
Congratz
---
I'm guessing that he didn't die instantly upon entering combat. If so then he should probably reevaluate his life (or lack thereof) as a tank. He died 9 seconds after acknowledging that the healer needed mana so who knows how long he actually waited for the healer to drink before pulling. My guess, based on the tank's reaction, is not long enough.
---
Obvious thing is to add a bunch of guards to flight paths, especially neutral ones.
---
Got you bro I'm subbing my first month tomorrow together with 2 friends.
---
Yes you are.
---
But you're also on a PvP server, so it's fair game.
---
Because that's what actually happened during OG Vanilla? I started playing a month after launch - on Illidan - and i will take layering any day over the clusterfuck that was those server caps. Early on there were 3-4 hour waits for popular servers over a month after launch... and then later i moved to Kirin Tor with a much smaller population and, uh, ever waited in a nine hour BG queue? I have. Not that BG queues are an issue in 1.12 but i bring that up as an example of numerous problems that happened on too-small servers. 
---
Vanilla was not designed for the population it -originally had-. Blizz had 0 clue the level of success it would have. The game took until Wrath to feel scalable. There were always going to be problems with Vanilla's design and the player base size using it - whether in Classic or the OG. Layers are a band-aid and they are going to go away... but what you're seeing isn't a result of modern Blizz bad decisions: it is the result of over-conservative player estimates baked into the fabric of Vanilla. 
---
BC helped some with better questing distribution and concious efforts to shape player traffic.
---
 Wrath is where the game felt like it could handle its player size - and as much as people will shout me down on this the much-loathed phasing was a part of that. It let the game much more granularly control player flow through zones and quests and keep mob competition contained to players at the same quest part as you. Now, of course it brought other drawbacks - but we can't ignore the benefits added. One of which is that the game became significantly more adaptable to the number of players out in the world.
---
The truth is it is a balancing act. No one wants immersion breaking where you don't see the people you 'should', but no one wants 45 people all camping the same vulture for a kill quest either. I'm guessing as Blizz iterates and AI gets better we'll eventually end up with a system that -feels- like a cohesive world without actually lumping millions of people into one (relatively tiny) world and still allowing people to play with their friends without rerolling... on retail in expansion 14.0 or whatever. As much as every new system in the game is 'booed' by the 'i'm going to parrot my favorite streamer' crowd Blizz is an innovative company and new technology they've developed has really gotten a chance to shine in x-pacs like Wrath and Legion... and to a lesser extent BFA and MoP (example: whatever you think of BFA's individual parts the allied race system is an elegant solution to long-standing issues, and whatever you think of the rest of MoP the timeless isle is still super-fondly remembered.)
---
TBH i think they could take some lessons from augmented reality games and find ways to move players around the space in a way that feels organic without requiring players to be separated in a way that feels visible. Real life can't be layered after all so games like pokemon go had to figure out clever ways to handle actual traffic. Invasions/incursions do some of this - but it would be nice to find a way to double down on it so that players would have incentive to be constantly on the move instead of clustering in one place where everyone is trying to get 20 bear spleens to drop.
---
I have the opposite experience, even staying in group for another round or questing in the same zone, lvl 37 so far met only one toxic rogue wannabe tank who was reserving gear drops for his friend warrior... Other than that i got a lot of help from random players. Ashbringer - eu
---
Yeah I think the current "Nihilum" is just a fan guild plus a few original members.
---
Human interactions in an online game are a real thing though
---
apparently you are unable to distinguish between real people in an online world and NPC of a videogame
---
noone complains about an NPC being a dick in the storyline of a quest
---
I can see you going like "/s MESSAGE Hey there, need an inv?"
---
Idk if you have tried playing on other servers, but it's possible that may be the problem. Always gonna have the problem servers, sadly =/
---
Reason I say that is because the three servers I play on people were, for the most part, very respectful and nice. Obviously there's a troll here and there, but from the servers i myself have tried, I haven't had much trouble, save for the non-rp names on RP servers, but that's a pretty small issue.
---
Sorry you didn't have a good experience =/
---
Vanas KoS does exactly this. Don't know if Spy is better or not.
---
Reserving has always been rampant, it just was never as direct or out in the open as it is today.
---
Back when the game first launched, all the endgame dungeons were 10(+) man and everyone were farming their t0 gear it used to be incredibly common to do "class runs" for the dungeons, essentially bring 1 of each class and that class has prio on their t0. That's a pseudo-reservation on the t0 gear
---
Then later it became "LF2M DPS for scholo NO CASTERS", i.e. "I need something from scholo and I'm not bringing anyone who will roll against me", again, that's a pseudo-reservation.
---
By reserving an item at least you let people who don't need that item into your group if they need something else.
---
When I play my druid (cat druid, considered healing but I like cat so much) I make a note of keeping an eye on the healers mana as best I can just because even though im on an RP server where most people are chill, it still happens that tanks sometimes just dont pay attention to the healer. Or in some cases like yesterday I get a dps warrior that thinks he can rush ahead of the tank and start pulling stuff because he's a warrior.
---
So I make an effort to watch the situation so I can pop out of cat form to throw some heal over time on people, even if it isnt quite as strong without Int gear
---
The level 2 is probably a scout for his main account. For places like gurubashi arena and the neutral AH. Deserves death for that.
---

good job ally brother. cant let them dirty horde players get any devilsaur items
---
Ah its so fucked. Got exited about 10stscks of heavy leather. Best is to Vendor. :(
---
what ? people triod onyxia in private servers 
---
so why it shouldnt be done with 20 more players than that
---
This is awesome, where is this and did you edit the pic?
---
Now imagine layering gone WITH constant wpvp ganking.    
---
    
---
You basically gotta make your gold now, cause in 2 months that gold per hour is gonna tank, HARD.
---
Uhh yeah, the feels.
---
Leveling as a rogue I had to create "reject" groups on my way to 60. Usually if you just type "quest run" or "full run" people understand it's not gonna be a turbo run.
---
And that is fine. I think reservations are good. Because they clearly communicate what the group is in for and allow better loot distribution. Still in the end people should be aware that reserving too much can result in issues with getting people.
---
A few examples:
---
1. Strat UD Healer robe locked - lf healer
---
This robe is BIS slot for all healing classes except priests and even there its affordable BIS. Why this strange group? Because the healing druid is tanking but will still need that robe. It's easier to find a healer that needs other stuff from Strat UD (quests, loot etc...) then to find a tank.
---
2. Tanks for hire. Need a Strat Living or Scholo run and a tank for it? Reserve the orbs or the Dark Runes for the tank and you'll have plenty of overgeared experienced tanks to choose that will do their utmost to prevent whipes from stupid shit leaving you free to pick up items/quests etc. You can also pay them if you don't like that.  You can also pawn of green drops and unneeded blues. 
---
3. Ironfoe reserved for tank. What reason has a fully geared tank to run BRD? Well Ironfoe could be one.
---
Tranquilo guey lol
---
thats why I stopped playing my shammy at lvl 37 - worst feeling of all as enhancement - have the dodge prarry miss streaks BUT ALSO have to drink after 2 to 3 mobs and windfurry only procs to overkill stuff .. really feels bad to lvl with tbh .. even worse with this axe when you are forced into the spin animation without getting wf procs ...
---
respec to ele at 40 and you will have a blast .. at least thats what I am doing when i play my shammy again
---
its fine if i cant chat but i cant even play the game cus i cant find a group cus i cant chat / whisper... that is not acceptable for the punishment.
---
Mail any items you don‚Äôt need to an alt. Whenever you need them, logon to your alt and have them ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the mail. It‚Äôll go into your mains inbox immediately.
---
Use this for arrows as a hunter is a lifesaver! 
---
Turns your mailbox into a bank!
---
Note: costs 30c per item.
---
Remember mobs/quests give more XP as you go to higher level content as well.
---
Really? Nothing?
---
You've already farmed hundreds of thousands of gold to buy consumables for phase 2?

who said anything about dieing in wow? 
---
being an ass to a player in wow is just like being an ass over the phone to someone or being an ass in a bar
---
"It's just a game" is the same lame excuse assholes used for decades akin to "it's just words" when people got upset being treated like shit by assholes
---
I heard something about warriors tanking with a 2-hander. What's the idea/build? I just rerolled to Warrior and if I can tank dungeons with my 2-hander, that would be awesome.
---
This calls for a mario meme.
---
He tried to do it to you first!
---
Nah I had same thing yesterday lol was helping a lower level buddy do his mage quest and he needed to go in Arathi where the thundering charms drop circle of binding or something like that. I killed a horde 20 something levels lower than me for to immediately message me ‚Äúsuck my d*** nword‚Äù (censored the curse words)
---
I just reported him and moved on, I didn‚Äôt even know you could message other faction until then lol. It must be part of an add on or something
---
This looks like about 30g on my server
---
alexa pls don,'t

instead , alexa play ‚ôÇÔ∏è AssClap ‚ôÇÔ∏è (Right version) REUPLOAD

Now playing: [‚ôÇÔ∏è AssClap ‚ôÇÔ∏è (Right version) REUPLOAD](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdqbI0_0GsM).

Only other thing I can think of is you sold your skinning knife on accident. Sorry I'm not much help.
---
Desolace horde chat be like:

"@#$! Where is Rexxar?"  
---
"Stupid Rexxar can't find this guy"

"Rexxar anyone?"

"LF Rexxar /w me"

"REXXXAAAAAAAARR??????????????????"

"Who is Rexxar?"

"What does this Rexxar guy drop?"

And what's about Misha? :-(

i have the feeling he DOES CARE about other people enjoyment, and it is important for him that they don't get it. And that he is taking part in the reason of them losing enjoyment

This is greatwizard mage who uses archangelsk font. It's not nicedamage add-on.
---
It's a full font change
---
it's not about the challenge sometimes, it's about doing your best to stop the opposing faction from having success, or slowing them down however you can. Now, i'm not saying you should kill low lvl players, but you COULD if you wanted to, call it a dick move but really what you'd be doing is slowing the opposing faction.
---
Horde vs Alliance is the single best thing about this game and it's sad that some people don't see that and prefer casting a rotation on A.I.
---
Will be used until you get T2 which is 4/6 months away. Gold well spent.
---
Durr
---
This is actually a good thing means the money from dungeons, raids, quests, and enemies is worth more.
---
nah, still have it.
---
The overwhelming vast majority of warriors who can't and don't want to tank I think take the cake over mages. Similarly with a ton of locks who only know how to use agony. Lots of retail and adhd kids everywhere.
---
Just curious:
---
What means of investigating stuff like this does Blizzard have? Do their server record player movement and actions, like a replay system? If not, how do they look into the past and know whether or not a player did something at a certain place and time?
---
What level can you go onxyia and mc? Thanks.
---
It's BRD, you knew what you signed up for, lol.
---
You can always create your own group then. Person goes through the effort of getting 4 other people so he gets to make rules for joining it.  If you dont want to make your own group for some reason then you just have to accept that annoyance.
---
Maybe his hand is broken and she wanted some kind of distraction for him...
---
You should upload gameplay! That would be sweet to see
---
Craft a bunch of really slow items on WoW and fletch 10's of thousands of a stackable in RS. Now you have free time to browse reddit while both games are busy. Hell could even play some mine sweeper where you are stuck on the 50/50 random guess for your last block on expert.
---
Return immediately? +1 for that tip :D
---
Warrior all the way
---
The worst part was letting you live when I saw you run by earlier.  It's okay though, we controlled the other 5 spawns at the time.
---
I had a group like this the other day as well. Graveyard, library then armory. All of us were around level 33, so most of my spells were resisting in armory. But we had no deaths, and a smooth run where we all had fun. It was great.
---
WoW is his pussy now
---
thats the point though, I was referring to leveling instances, not end game raiding. Warriors are tanking in DPS spec, just as healers are healing in DPS spec, cos they all still need to solo quest in between instances. 
---
So its harder on both.  Healers need to spam bigger heals on the tank as they are not prot, as they take more damage, and can gain aggro if the heals crit.  its a vicious cycle :D 
---
I even use Bandages on myself rather than through bigger heals my way (also saves mana for the tank and other party). 
---
If properly specced, should have an issue with aggro (healer gaining it or tank losing it).
---
The main difference is how the gold people are buying is obtained.
---
With WOW tokens, the gold you buy comes from other players, buying game time, for the most part.
---
With buying Gold from Gold sellers, it's often from bots, hacked accounts, etc.
---
DISADVANTaGES: Cannot utilize engineering items, certain enchants or item procs.
---
Good / Bad: Lackluster item progression. Weapon damage doesnt improve their threat, then again they start out at quite high level compared to shitty geared warriors. When warriors get BIG improvements, bear increase in effectiveness is somewhat stagnant. Good druid items come mostly from AQ-patch, aka \~1 year after release.
---
Isn't eye of divinity / leaf guaranteed anyhow
---
I think you should equip your shield first.
---
They presumably mean they bought 1 month of non-recurring time, like the old gametime cards
---
Had a friend swing by my house at 11AM yesterday and we finished playing at 3AM.. 
---
Definitely casual friendly :P
---
Ok so I run on top of a pebble and get one shot. Sounds good
---
Only edgemasters, and even with them Orc racial still has value. Not to mention that they're rare, expensive, and you're still sacrificing other stats to wear them.
---
I thought it was pretty common knowledge. Tank Troll makes sense because Berserkering helps to ramp up and keep aggro. Especially considering your HP will drop from the boss damage and allow you to get more value from your racial. Whereas Orc Warrior is better for damage and PvP.
---
But then again I'm a gnome mage player(OP race for mages btw, that I can personally confirm), so don't consider me a warrior expert or anything.
---
Economy will grow slowly but it will
---
Currently a level 34 Priest. Sitting on 20g - need to farm the remaining 70/80g for my mount over the next 6 levels. Any recommendations?
---
Honestly the only bad healers ive been grouped with were 2, both in deadmines.
---
One was boosting his warrior tank friend in level so we let them both in despite the low lvl'ed tank, because the healer was massively overleveled. But he kept either going idle for a few seconds or getting distracted by loot or mining even during pulls. So the tank died again and again.
---
The other one wasnt neccesarily -bad- but not as mature as I might've liked. Went into deadmines with us just for the 6 int 2 agi ring- although didnt mention thats what he was after. Ofc the 2 other randoms who used Agi rolled need on it despite it being much more useful to the healer and he admitted he was just here for that and didnt plan to do the rest of the dungeon. So even though it sucks that it was ninja'ed from him his attitude to just leave after that boss wasnt great either, fortunately we talked him into staying for the rest.
---
Yes, but you could make it so that needing a BOE item made it vendor for 0 ontop of making it become soulbound. That would remove all selfishness possible
---
Mass AOE is not perfection, nor is it efficient for 90% of pugs
---
Because theyre scared no alliance to pvp will be around  once phase 2 hits. 
---
Ive read about skeram alliance transferring by the guild because of hardcore pvp guilds ganking the shit out of them.
---
that looks like cooking 300
---
The only thing I can't understand with this post is "I've come to the conclusion that mages and warriors are the new huntards."
---
Sure, I hate mages as well (self hate, since I'm a mage) - but coming to the conclusion that mages suck after a warrior being braindead is new...
---
its cold and it has springs. whats not to get?
---
Why would they have diffrent teams? More overhead for little or no benefit. Unless I'm missing something, whuc is quite possible.
---
That didn't answer their question though.
---
Ohhhhh my man, I levelled as a hpally in Vanilla! I feel your pain! üò¨
---
Do a ret spec with some points in holy. Get to Arathi to get the non elite quests done, get Faldir‚Äôs cove done. That should get you to 40. 
---
Get your mount and head to Badlands. If you still can‚Äôt get STV done solo or with a couple people you might need to do some Uldaman runs maybe. 
---
Feralas and naga grind there in the caves for a few levels of blissfully horde free xp. At that stage getting towards mid 40‚Äôs or more, you‚Äôve got higher level Feralas quests and Tanaris.

Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

Make sure you do /who g-[guild name] doing so restricts the search to guilds.
---
Stop being so salty for no reason. I don't like them either, but they don't affect you. At. All.
---
I usually kill alliance on sight. But one time for some reason I saw 2 alliance doing an escort quest and decided to help them all the way through. I have no idea why.
---
Rogue is one of the slowest classes to level bro don‚Äôt listen to these people once you get to Around 35 with good gear rogue isn‚Äôt bad but warlock is way faster have leveled a warlock and rogue to 60 vanilla.
---
The other day people were claiming org was under attack and the flight master was being perma killed on my server. 
---
I checked my gen chat tab and didn't see anything warning me it was under attack. Then I remembered layering os a thing right now. So turned out all was well and it was another dimensions problem.
---
seems to be working perfectly, spamming should get you out of being able to do group content for the duration of the silence.

You werf flamens?

Yay i'm halfway

You fucked up. Stop whining.

Sort of did this.

Leveled a mage at launch kinda quick (12days, 6days played)

Mages are floded because of the ‚Äùmeta‚Äù, instantly regretted rolling a mage but the grind is brutal on a warrior, my vanilla class.

Hi, I use my brains to remind myself in one day

nice

We have 2 unbreakable CCs :p

How so? I'm on stalag. Want to know what I'm missing out on

BOE item made it vendor for 0 ontop of making it become soulbound. That would remove all selfishness possible.
---
Honestly I would be all in on such a change.
---
And post to reddit, aswell.
---
I just get a sense that the game is cluttered with irrelevant junk and every expansion that feeling gets worse. 
---
There are all these cool dungeons and raids in the game that I never really experienced but if I want to progress my character - I have to run a specific few over and over, spam mythic + (running them even more) and then do the exact same raid 3 times over each week for gear. 
---
BFA sucks ass imo
---
This is correct, this is probably the issues you're having.
---
This is how my macro looks and it works:
---
/cast defensive stance
---
/equip shield
---
/equip one-hander
---
/cast shield bash
---
Try it. It's definitely worth it!
---
Omg. That shouldn‚Äôt be there. Someone should report this as a bug. I know it‚Äôs not supposed to work. Weird.
---
Then the hunter FD or the mage IB and the mob will beeline to the heal : /
---
Apparently they do if you are able to be standing before the end of the 200ms batching upon which the crit was being applied
---
Sylvanas is a special case. She was killed by Arthas and raised as a banshee, and when she "broke free" she started possessing her own dead body (that Arthas was preserving cause he a creep).
---
I  paid for 1 month, my sub ended yesterday? Currently iam far away from home on vacasion and i wont resub. Lvl 60 and 1 raid  was fine.

I love how you're literally the only snowflake around lol.
---
Wow... I really underestimated how lucky I was with SM Arm. I got all 4 warrior drops (Axe, Pants, Helm, Shoulders) from Herod in about 7 runs. Not trying to be a dick, just gaining a newer appreciation for my recently obtained gear!
---
Rerolled a third time to a tank warrior. Now I want to reroll again to tank druid!
---
Line of sight, running out of range, wotf, silence, interrupt,fear, any cc.
---
Just run to the back room and if they try and mc you run around the corner. It's a 3 second cast. You can los very easily.
---
As a warrior I am insulted at being likened to a huntard.
---
I mean, my mage friend gives me intellect buffs sometimes!
---
You forgot arcane explosion while jumping like a frog in a sock.
---
Not world first, and stop saying world first for everything that happens. World first stonescale eel fished up btw
---
Always gotta have shield first in the macro in classic or it bugs out sometimes
---
You don't have a "Shop" tab in your character selection screen ? If yes there should be a "free server transfer" button
---
What times are you playing at? Because I'm on flamelash and i'd say it's a medium-high populated server late afternoon and evening.
---
Also use LFG chat, it's easier for finding groups! Most people are higher level these days but their alts will come
---
its as alt unfriendly as it gets.  
---
gearing up 1 character is already hard. gearing up several takes a lot of time.
---
not to mention that the pre quests are fun once and attrocious the next couple times.
---
oh, and theres the fact that leveling up an alt takes several days. yeah, that ain't helping either.
---
I did my first gnomeregan run yesterday with a friend of mine and a group of randoms we gathered over the course of maybe an hour or so because it was in the early hours so most people were working or at school or the like. All of them were pretty cool to just hang out with even if my friend and I was just on the edge of being too low lvl for the dungeons suggested lvl. Took it slow and easy and all our fights went really well (aside from the dwarfs placing mines. We died so much there) and throughout the entire thing we just had relaxed banter and joking going back and forth. And so many movie references to amusing moments that we had.
---
As a feral druid I can understand his frustration, but the need/greed rules go out the window with items that expensive,  it's just reality. You cant expect 4 randoms to just give you a 500g BOE epic because it's good for you. 
---
I generally would hope theyd offer to sell to you at a reasonable price but even that isnt required or even expected
---
Perfectly captured
---
Why salvation?
---
Would you please share it if you don't mind?
---
Everyone realises. Nobody thinks this thread is representative of the millions of people that play. Ironically, you're the one that hasn't realised people are simply posting their own point of view.

It's up to the player, but most people choose the sever their friends play on. For me that happen to be a pvp sever. I enjoy pvp but it's incredibly frustrating when you are literally unable to level because you are getting camped. Some of my friends that started after me have asked many times for us to switch server to a low pop pve server, but I can't see that being good for anything besides leveling.
---
The part where you get chain dazed is just so true.
---
Every day I am getting dazed, fml
---
i know i fucked up but thats not my point
---
*And doing so until he killed himself*
---
I was 8 when I played Vanilla, 22 now and actually rocking it. Took me 2 years to hit 47 pre-TBC - I lvled as a Melee, no-pet hunter.
---
This time I am about to hit 40!
---
Am hunter, can confirm
---
Starting with lvl 36 you get whirlwind, that helps with getting initial aggro with slow weapons. Before that you can still use 2 handers because it really doesn't matter
---
I'm ashamed to admit I have more of these types of clips if the community wants them.
---
The whole world is layered, not just the cities themselves.
---
QQ
---
Drain tanking is becoming more popular now and it works well. You can handle elites with fear. Leveling with imp till 20 and succ all the way to 60 is recommended.
---
Listen man, blizzard silently flags accounts and delays bans for a giant wave. I'm sure they're just letting people think they got away with it before they thanos *snap* all the cheaters. Don't worry about things you can't control.
---
Yes, yes. Go and buy those Ghost dyes. Just started crafting them today :D atm 1.4g profit per one, i hope they will be selling well.
---
No bear should need water unless they just rebuffed. If they are trying to power shift for rage that means they don't have bear talents. And  don't know how to manage their pull
---
why is a copied answer which is 100% accurate in any way a bad thing - should he rephrase it to not be accounted for plagiarism or what? just wtf!
---
Yeah, got the same when I did my benediction
---
I initially subbed for 6 months with my primary interest being pvp stuff, not realizing that the stuff I wanted to do wouldn‚Äôt be in the game for at least 6 months.
---
I totally forgot it 5 minutes afterwards, and didn't remember until a friend linked me this.  Not the first time its happened in un goro, won't be the last.
---
The dungeons are easy, especially before the 52+ bracket and getting the aggro isn't only the tank's fault
---
300-500g is bis for every class üòâ it would have been lovely if they had let him have it, but completely fair to all need
---
Warlocks are great for farming with no downtime once geared a bit I've heard.
---
Mages are good too but they need to drink a lot. 
---
Also you shouldn't get kited as a shaman
---
What does brd and zf have to do with it? Legit curious. Just dinged 50 and interested in anything to get 60 faster. I grinded on mobs from 46-50. Tbh questing is a nightmare in classic
---
accountant_classic
---
You should probably have played the game before you comment
---
Haven't played in over 5 years. Best decision to do so.
---
Where are you getting 40 rage before a pull to immediately swipe 2x? Even if you could it wouldnt hold agro vs a mage or hunter multishot.
---
Challenging roar is on a 10min cd.
---
Swipe costs 20 rage and hits 3 targets for a very small amount of threat. It wasn't changed to hit all targets until a later expansion. Thrash wasn't added until later either.
---
Maul is 15 rage and causes massive threat. It is the only way to keep agro. It replaces auto attack so you have to queue it up and wait.
---
Sunder also costs 15 rage but its an instant skill. Its faster and easier for a warrior to tab + sunder.
---
Not saying bears are bad, but they clearly arent as good as warriors. Hybrid tax is real. (I play one now, and in vanilla-bc-wrath)
---
Interesting theory, here why it wont work:
---
- Pets don't lose happiness while dead/despawned, they need to be active/alive
---
- Simply killing the pet a few times wont cause it to run away UNLESS its freshly tamed and thus loyalty level 1, any loyalty lvl 6 pet (max) will require a ton of effort before it leaves the hunter you actually have to down-rank its loyalty level from 6 to 0.
---
- Hunters can spend their training points to give their pets a shit ton of armour/resistance, good luck trying to frost nova/bolt the thing with hundreds of frost resist (pvp hunters will be giving their pet tons of frost/shadow/arcane resist).
---
Go right ahead and try to kill the thing, it will give me time to setup for some big Aimed Shots.
---
I have to disagree. Quests in classic in general but especially compared to Runescape are veeery repetitive, boring and quite bland. Occasionally there are some quests that are fun but most are just go and kill these people or kill and collect something from them.
---
I'm sure if you looked up on wowhead you could find a tank build for leveling.
---
not with that attitude.
---
you have to become the monk. Equip a robe and a staff.
---
It wasn't to me, but when speaking to the guildie he said he didnt offer to sell it as he thought that would be a bit disrespectful considering the tone of the druid (Insulting him the entire time for not giving the item).
---
The player in question basically gave me the ultimatum
---
Get the player to give him the staff or gkick him. If neither of those things happen he will spam that our guild is full of toxic ninja looters all day every day.
---
The guild member offered to leave off his own back and said that he doesnt want this to be the downfall of our guild. But I reassured him that people will see this guys true colours.
---
GG ! Dinged 60 in WPL/EPL and haven't found a single BoHeroes :(
---
They're not reflected.
---

---
Been following the classicwow.live guide which has been great for someone like me who often forget to bring quests cross zones and then have to backtrack a lot. Since I‚Äôve done quite a few more dungeons than the guide suggests, I‚Äôve been a few levels ahead for awhile (since 38ish, I‚Äôm now 52), which means the guide thinks I just hit 50, but I‚Äôm close to 53. My question is, should I just continue the guide from level 50, or skip to 53?
---
Mages are not op, sure they are a great pvp class but it‚Äôs heavily circumstantial. You just need to know how to counter. Also consider the players different skill lvl in pvp.
---
I'm not worried about leveling. I'll find away to do that regardless of what I choose. I just want to be the best tank I can.
---
I'm surprised, i tried to see if i could add horde by right clicking their portrait and was't able to (it was like 2 weeks ago)
---
Real Ni\*\*a
---
&gt;4 of the top horde guilds! You're toast.
---
He has top men working on it right now. Top. Men.
---
I only played PvE previously, rolled pvp this time for some world action but a bit let down so far. I guess phase 2 won't disappoint
---
Ridiculously so. Especially at Ungoro. Felt like 50-54 were my quickest levels yet
---
&gt;Swipe damage is low
---
Higher than sunder, that\`s for sure. Swipe also has 175% threat modifier (on top of 130% for being a bear), so it scales with crits.  
---
&gt; good gear with +STR is hard to get 
---
You don't need it.  +Agi is superior. Stack Agi, crit swipes all the time, never run out of rage.
---
&gt; While Maitoz does a great job leading, more needs to be said of the players being able to calmly follow instructions and keep comms relatively clear 
---
Why people praise the organisation so much here?
---
Every Guild Wars 2 World vs World group is way more disciplined and organised than that. When they were told to charge in they scatered and only half hearted followed through...
---
can be too
---
Hit 60 last night at 7d1h. I'm happy with that as a paladin with no dungeon grinding. Done maybe 5 dungeons in total, so mostly solo.
---
I believe you do get wf procs while spinning, it just shows up after the animation is over.
---
First things first.. I am a recovering altaholic.. I have, in one month, made easily 10+ characters that are 15 or under and deleted them as I CANNOT bear to have more than one toon... that is my goal at least.. to just give all my time to one! In my trials I have narrowed it down to two classes.. Duid or Rogue. I LOVE them both but can't focus on one as I am a filthy casual for the time being and just don't have the time to nurture both classes. I love ROgues because they can pick their fights and that is big for me as I do know gotta have WPvP. I also dig being able to vanish for and the fact that you can do some trolling with Distract and Saps. So to me they are great PvPers with some novelty. Druids on the other hand makes sense to me because they CAN do it all AND have Rogue like qualities with Cat Form. They obviously get into groups because of their versatility but it may also help when I just get tired of one spec or role, just bam and Im swapped into something fresh and new. The final bit is just my love for the overall class fantasy of the nature bits as well as being able to transform into animals... its just rad to me... but as far as  PvP I just don't think they'll deliver what a Rogue can.
---
So.. this is where I stand. I am hoping you good folks can help me pick between the two! Any insights and tidbits are greatly appreciated. Thanks a ton in advance!
---
(Apologies for the garbanzo format.. just rambling from the heart here!)
---
It's like a rogue getting mad when everyone needs shadowfang because it's his best in slot weapon for 19 twinking. Nobody cares, that is worth half a mount lol. Always need anything extremely valuable.
---
they still got ur devilsaur

I think your thinking of the old republic because SWG is one of the few unique and different MMOs that ever existed. Everything was player created. Weapons. Armor. City's. Story's. No npcs telling you to go here and kill this. Your just dropped into a world and figure out what you want to do for yourself
---

My tactic is to path as though I am passing them, then rend+sunder the mob they are killing. Obviously this doesn't help with ganks, but so far that basically guarantees that the Allies know I'm just here to quest and I'm not gonna fuck them as soon as their back is turned.
---
I have several stacks of oily blackmouth and firefins, they are worth shit right now. Literally 15-20 silver per stack.
---
get to 200, get the +20 pole (+25 if you're horde) and the +75 lure and you'll be good to go.
---
Haven't fished there myself yet but my friend was there at 200 fishing with +75 lure and was still getting a few misses, the better pole will fix that issue.
---
I had a video banging around of a 3-man Naxx-geared team doing it. Prot warrior, holy paladin, some sort of hunter.
---
Needless to say the video was sped up a *lot*.
---
If everything you google tells you that it's over level 60 don't you think that kinda answers your question?
---
15% is correct. I recently transfered 50g via the neutral ah and lost 7,5g in the process.
---
There you go. So what do you want the Mage to do with all the mobs? Bring them over to you? What for?
---
theres one thig you should consider tho (and give you hope) from like 52 you can farm Brd, then 54 lbrs. a lot of your preraid (or even for raids) bis comes from these places. so you will be leveling, but already do ‚Äúend game‚Äù. from 57 you can continue into ubrs strat scholo.
---
Till ZF ive played with another warrior in dungeons and we both used 2handers.  
---
Works great...  
---
Then in BRD it wont work anymore.  
---
You'll get stomped and giving the healer a very hard time
---
Thank you, friend. It is indeed very sexy
---
If you're that new, if you go to interface&gt;camera, you can change the camera range to zoom out a lot more than what it's set to automatically. 
---
I know it's pretty random but I discovered that *very* late when I started playing and it can make such a difference.
---
Genius, now i cant unsee it either haha
---
stack of stonescale on ashbringer goes for close to 5 g, stacks of mageweave bolts are going for like 4-6g at time, im guessing runecloth is going to be like 8g
---
What happens if everyone is invited to the same layer I wonder

I picked up engineering on my hunter and ive been loving the strong guns and ammo so much. But my god I almost need to afk dungeons to not pull except the times I get godlike tanks. Because being boosted by all this strong engineering gear just lifts my damage up so far. Currently I just do exclusively autoshots after waiting a couple of seconds after the tank pulls.
---
17 days, 11 hourls  
---
Lvl 55. with a lot of afk time on the first week :D
---
I‚Äôm a Frost Mage and I don‚Äôt like to AoE grind. I much prefer a slow and steady approach. Then again I play this game to relax.
---
I do agree with everyone rolling need on BOEs in pugs, especially epics. There is no guarantee someone would use a boe and could end up seeling it on the ah. Even if they could use it, it would be pretty insignificant while leveling because you get better gear quickly. But in this case it was bis which hurts the druid but still, he could sell it.
---
So what I would do when leading a group and it's full is making sure I tell everyone they should roll on boes, chests, nodes and herbs. Trying to avoid drama.
---
As a person who is usually VERY unlucky with drops and then rolling I usually reserve. Especially when I only need 1 item from the entire dungeon. I hate wasting an hour on a dungeon only to get nothing out of it, as I find them boring and want the gear for PVP mainly. And yes it is much harder to find parties like this so I have come up/rediscovered a new method, where if one or more people want the same item, they can opt to pay for you to pass, so atleast you get to gain something from the dungeon. Like we both roll on the wand from scholo and whoever wins gives the loser 20-30g.
---
I use willitclassic.com

If you're having to repair you are in the wrong group.
---
LE UPBOATS HAHA NARWHAL BACONS!!! 
---
I LOVE OUR INSIDE JOKES
---
1. melee cleave is a thing
---
2. you don't have to join those groups, I can very well understand reserving a drop you where farming for months, it's a concious decision to take longer to form the group in exchange for no competition on the item
---
I still agree with your original statement
---
elitism and meta people ruin this game
---
If feral tanks could hold threat better then they would be taken over warriors in speedrun guilds, but they simply don't.
---
And farming 10 pummelers before every raid is easy, but definitely not fast.
---
so what you're saying is to camp the badlands for brokentooth, allow hunters to tame it, and then immediately kill their pet?
---
Oooh, so both the different formula and the penalty kick in when great than 10 weapon skill difference.
---
Everyone let's keep "no log in" day tomorrow and demand them to change it!
---
'Moo'
---
People are dumb. They don't understand that layering was the only solution to not making this game unplayable
---
This is why my bank is pretty much full with Eels, oils, pots, &amp; elixirs.
---
I don't see the point in selling them cheap just for the sake of selling them.
---
While leveling, I'd get the 31 point talent in the feral tree as well. Sure, you won't be able to get NS and be one talent point behind, but you won't get that before lvl 60 anyways and in the meantime, you both will get the crit aura.
---
We you're bad and you're not gonna have a mount till you're level 50
---
What about i haven't had sex since WoW vanilla came out
---
That looks like good pace.
---
Berserker rage CC that you have literally no possible way of knowing is heading your way. 
---
Yeah ok.

Swap Hunter with Mage for the 2019 version
---
Jagex have no customer support.
---
Like, its so bad they have none. They have an official 'CS Twitter' which gives out wrong answers, is mostly automated and is a clusterfuck of bad spelling mistakes.
---
Its become sort of a meme/sort of true that the only way whatsoever to get any replies to issues around bans/something in the game is to post it on reddit and hope that your post is one that will get highly upvoted.
---
Its the only way to get an answer from Jagex at this point.
---
I'm the GM of my guild, and I had the same thing happen yesterday over a Dwarven Handcannon. I explained the frustrated hunter that I (as a mage) wouldnt expect a PuG to pass on freezing band for me if it dropped.
---
If its a BoE blue and its BiS, I would pass it. If its an epic, and your in a pug group lets be honest everyone needs gold.
---
I'm sure healing won't be that bad at sixty even if he his shadow as long as he has some good healing gear.
---
You might be right
---
I don't remember exactly because I stopped caring about that shit years ago, but isn't the biggest problem of bear tanks in raids that they get huge amounts of damage because they can't push crush/crits off the hit table?
---
I mean on my server, guys farming devilsaur already made upwards of 20K gold. 11 million seems extremely far fetched but with dedication or playing the AH with huge amounts of money you can get disgustingly rich.
---
&gt;If there are 3 layers worth of people farming mats on one server then there are more resources being put into the economy than if they were all on one layer competing with each other.
---
Yes, but there are only 3 layers because there are more players than what would ba allowed online at one time. This means that there are also 3 times the resources and 3 times the buyers. This basically evens itself out.
---
I use Accountant Classic. Tracks profit and spending across your characters and can be set up with n various ways.

Not even close, dude
---
ah ok well atleast this - was not to sure because it says "causing weapon damage" and I thought wf can only proc of weapon swings
---
Here's my story about how a tauren warrior and human paladin helped eachother with a quest killing a queen insect deep inside a hell hole in ungoro crater last week (Ahn'Qiraj foreshadowing).
---
I am the paladin and thought of course i could solo this easily like most other quests (this wasnt even elite), fought my way deep inside that wretched hole infested with space bugs and started fighting the waves of annoying bugs that spawned when i tried to summon the queen. After two back-to-back waves of multiple bugs the queen arrives with even more bugs and ive already used one bubble and am suffering from forbearance. I have no choice but to pop a pot and try my best cause i sure as hell cant run away in this tiny hell hole and the loot-less bugs i slayed are gonna respawn any minute. In comes a tauren warrior followed by a bug of his own. After grasping the situation (and probably noticing i hadnt tagged the queen yet) he charged the queen and pulled her and one the guards away so that i could barely survive. After a /ty and /salute i realize that i actually didnt get the kill, briefly considered killing the warrior out of good justice and wrath, then just /cry really. He then spawns the waves again and we double team the bugs this time. Things go smoothly until the fkn hellspawn bugs start respawning AGAIN as we're fighting the queen and her guards. I try to save him from death but to no avail. On the brink of death myself i manage to execute the queen, loot, and bubble run away whilst thinking maybe i should've just died down there with him instead - it would've been more noble. Bubble didnt last long enough and surely i died too trying to get out of that god-forsaken hell hole.
---
I dont remember his name, but i will remember to never attempt to solo that quest again. And the moral of the story is somewhere along the line of "bring a friend and/or some protection if youre going deep into a bug-infested hell hole for a queen" and "hordes and allies have a common enemy in the fkn space bugs so quell the bloodthirst and cooperate if you wanna raid bugs".
---
Any chance you could pm me your add-on list please? :)
---
This reminds me of that video with that irish fellow holding a pre-drinking speech..
---
"There was only one bar!"
---
"Awwww"
---
"A MILE LONG!"
---
"YAAAAAY"
---
"They didn't serve pints!"
---
"ONLY BUCKETS!"
---
I should go watch that video now. Thanks for reminding me! :D
---
Maul is tanking druids main tool, you've got it backwards. Swipe is for rage dumping. Maul generates multiplicative threat and is the best ST threat move in the game.
---
Everyone benefits equally from skinning - none of it is soulband.
---
But then it wouldn‚Äôt be vanilla experience. ü§™
---
Hey cool, I'm on Benediction as well :D then I have a couple horde on Anathema... Because reasons ;)
---
An additional tip regarding this:  Sort your mail as you are sending it.  I'm an herbalist and alchemist, so when I mail herbs to my bank alt, I send them in batches of the same herb only (2 stacks of dreamfoil in one send, 3 stacks of plaguebloom in the next).  That way, when I need specific herbs, I can just return the stacks of what I need without sending back my entire collection just to return it all again and waste the postage.
---
That‚Äôs why I said they aren‚Äôt fussed with it because it isn‚Äôt boring in response to someone who said they aren‚Äôt fussed with it because they pay a sub...
---
Wasn't it TBC? Or at least TBC-pre-patch?
---
And the other half are 4 warriors and a "healer" trying to get either Ravager or Sul'thraze
---
Meh not hard just different. Easily 1v1 most things. Can get away from most gankers. It‚Äôs very fun tbh. Getting into a group might be hard but that goes for most dps
---
Druids use rage but ok
---
Probably just a bunch of salty kids. Ignore them
---
It's not flawed, you did something wrong and are being punished. 
---
If for instance, you truly accidentally clicked need instead of pass or greed on someone else's BiS, you'd probably be kicked and badmouthed as a ninja, even if you knew it was a mistake. 
---
Ignorance is not innocence
---
ee mages bad
---
yeah.
---
i just hit 60 on sunday and am already at the point where i just need to get on once a week to do ony/mc.  i'm not even sure if hitting 60 in that many calendar days is even rushed. by the time i hit 60 there were already ~700 60s on my server/faction(census addon was broken about that time)
---
whenever BWL comes out that will mean there is a weekly ony, mc, bwl, and BGs to do. that will be enjoyable to me.
---
I don't get commenters defending layers here. Sure it makes the game playable on a overpopulated servers, but the problem here is that the servers are overpopulated beyond any reasonable limit in the first place and Blizzard are the ones who allowed that to happen. 
---
They failed at planning the initial launch and opened up with too few servers, and then increased the capacity each server can hold by  splitting it into N layers, introducing a weird-ass problems ruining the immersion. This was just a dirty quickfix to a bigger problem. 
---
There must've been a way to be smarter about opening up servers to public and not allow populations grow too much. They have control over every mechanism: queues, server count, character transfers. I'm sure they knew the demand was high, too -- there was a reason why they let "reserve" a character name a few weeks before launching.
---
Every realm must be a single "layer". It's a single world, where everyone and everything exists. If you have capacity problems in that world, i.e. it's too populated, you add a queue to block off other players wanting to join and open other worlds. It's an easy logic. Instead they added more complexity by adding "layers", making the same sort of decision which later ruined WoW in the first place - creating systems which makes QoL better for players, but ruin the immersion.
---
You can't even fight back. To do so the guards kill you.
---
Happened to me as well. Been playing wow for 10 years. There is always something new to learn.
---
I got a hold of a translated message that i spammed as horde a bit bit over 10-12 years ago in Dalaran, don't think I knew what it said or didn't care,  just thought it was funny. Got 3 day ban for racial slurs.
---
I thought only one person gets the mount. Or is there a time frame from when the gate opens?
---
Rogue isn't the fastest levelling but it is fun, and its pretty easy as you always dictate how and when to fight.
---
Go combat spec for levelling, the others are more fun but combat is way more efficient.
---
That's him!
---
He was  on ED and later on K1
---
Stop looting everything, it's unnecessary, especially at your level.
---
Never EVER go back to a town just to sell, if your inventory is full, trash something.
---
Had a really bad chain pull last night in brd.  I think we got 3 mobs packs in total for one of those 'welp, I guess this is a wipe' moments.
---
But I realised I still had last stand and shield wall and berserker rage, and the group didn't panic like most do when shit hits the fan.
---
So without communicating, aoe stuns were rotated, lock started life tapping down to 'just about alive with no aggro' health, the healer didn't waste mana during my shield wall and waited to pop his pot and spam to oom until after my hs and hp pot.  Just about survived with me on 5% health.
---
After we recovered, I put a 'crisp heals btw' in chat.  Know it made the healer's night :)
---
Are sword spec humans not pro?
---
Zaldalar tribe is love
---
Step up above warriors, but they aren't particularly strong for leveling imo. They depend on their weapons for damage so you need to keep them updated and are weak at taking on multiple mobs. They get some cooldowns later that will help this a little. On the positive side, they don't need water, they have stealth which is massive for world PvP, pickpocket macros help save for mount gold, and if you know what you're doing and are prepared to take advantage of a rogue's kit and cooldowns you can handle quite a lot.
---
Shaman don't because they used their earthshock on cooldown for max dps as well as max blaming the tank for not holding aggro.
---
Dubyah dubyah dubyah dot wowhead classic dot com
---
LFG or LFGF?
---
Damn that‚Äôs insane! Thanks for sharing!
---
I mean, It'd be kinda nice to have 1.12 talents and +spell damage compensated for.
---
Well everytime i ask or search lol.
---
But mainly because i see if i push some shocks and stormstrike i really get fucked with mana. Its like dropping 2 totems a shock and stormstrik there you go 1k mana..lol
---
So you really think going ele is the best leveling route? I think indont have a single mail piece..
---
You've already been told what you can do - form your own groups. If I can do it, playing with my gf on 2 dps classes - as a tank this would be a piece of cake. 
---
You can't help people who won't help themselves.
---
Not really, id say average only because you facetank damage because you are melee, but combat is fairly easy and does a lot of damage.As long as you get decent gear will be easy, Im a dagger rogue and I lv up with a warrior I usually twoshot mobs from behind, ambush and backstab crit (50% crit almost)
---
Judgement is so fucked I urge everyone to stay away unless they are alliance.
---
Just roast them in the LFG channels when they do this, no one wants to go for dungeon runs where they cant get any loot.
---
If people want to reserve loot they should run with their guild.
---
Also dont forget food and badages we have no sustain.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
Related: Has anyone analyzed Jokerd /played info in this similar fashion? Would be interesting too, I guess.
---
Let thou whom hath not been a giventh a warning, be granted the first game time
---
Because of the +5 axe it puts them at 305 which is within the 10 point threshold of level 63 bosses (which raid bosses are). Effectively it gives them 3% towards their hit cap so they can put more percentages to crit chance and other stats
---
They drop cloth which means bandages which means infinite grinding for non-mana classes. And they can be pickpocketed. And some mobs don't wear armor so you can melt them.
---
[T
---
Everyone provides a utility in dungeons. Some people can summon, others make water and food, some rez etc. Unlocking is what rogue brings to the table. The ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt do it without me‚Äù mindset doesn‚Äôt make sense when other classes are using their roles for your advantage too. You just don‚Äôt realize it because you‚Äôre selfish.
---
Lol you are bad. The break even point for downranking is between 200 and 400 bonus healing dependig on class. You can't get even close to that with SM level gear, or anything up until pre-raid BiS and raid gear.
---
And you expect to take someone‚Äôs time and bother them in return for nothing? Do you think only one person asks them per day? Mages are CONSTANTLY flooded with people asking for water. Sure they‚Äôre just gonna whip up stacks upon stacks of water for free or a pitiful 20 silver. 50 silver is nothing bro, and a hell of a lot cheaper than buying real water.
---
People take turns on nodes what are you talking about?
---
Mages are alcoholics, they will take any excuse to dump their mana so they can get an MB
---
Up to around 24 it really lacks tools to be efficient. Gets better after that. As a class a rogue is more about knowing what CD's you have available and planning your next attack based on that. It's not harder than any other class in PvE. In PvP you need to know when and how to shut down opponent with stuns, you can't just burst your way to victory like warrior or mage can. So I'd say that while it's strong for pvp, it takes bit more effort to play well as you really need to know opponents toolkit too.
---
Desolace. I can't say enough good things about that zone. Perfect mob density for a solo warrior. You can easily pull just one or two at time, and the areas where the levels graduate are clearly divided by a big bluff, so it's not as easy to mistake the identical but higher level mobs as in the Barrens.
---
If you get low on bandages there are centaurs everywhere, also conveniently provided in a variety of levels so that your never sacrificing XP efficiency for first aid supplies.
---
A lot of the quests overlap so you get double credit for killing the same stuff, so be sure to scope out the whole place on first arrival or you may have to do some extra running.
---
If you are careful and use hamstring to run away you can do all of the Kodo Graveyard quests at level 32-33 within an hour, even the one labeled 38. Just be aware that when you pick up the bones a 38 ghost will appear so be ready to run. The leashes are short though and they are melee units. Nbd.
---
Once you are 34 centaurs are a great grind, as are the demons in the north. Those guys are so swishy and they don't even run away like humanoids.
---
Once you hit 35/36 NAGAS. Holy hell, they have great loot tables, low weapon skill for their level, and 4 quests in their area. Pretty much just kill anything that moves in the water and you will be making progress on something.
---
Was there for about two days and I didn't get ganked once. Hell I only saw 5 enemy faction the whole time I was there and they were mostly sad warriors clearly in the same situation as me. I felt more comrade with those poor bastards than anyone in my own faction lol
---
Pocket mage inc.
---
what in the fuck happened to this thread
---
Well you kind of gotta be higher level since a few Nova resists will fuck up the pulls if going big
---
&gt; it's incredibly frustrating when you are literally unable to level because you are getting camped.
---
This is "literally" never the case. If a faction has control of a particular zone and you can't get any help, go somewhere else and quest there. You aren't "literally" unable to level. There is a way to escape every situation. If they actually are being twats that won't even let you res, just take the res sickness and dip to another level appropriate zone for a bit. 
---
Letting instances like this frustrate you to the point of actually getting angry just doesn't make sense to me. You can take control of your experience and leave or fight back at any time.
---
That is what I‚Äôm doing. But I would like an addon if possible.
---
i play WoW or nba 2k for ~2-3 hrs every second and my GF thinks im addicted and bitches about being neglected.
---
females bro...
---
Why, ally dominated?
---
I don't know how reddit spacing works, they were all on new lines in this little box
---
Bears get 10 rage from shifting with furor
---
10 rage from popping enrage, and 20 over 10 seconds from the ability.
---
Bears can start literally every pull 40 rage in
---
Swipe is 15 you always get the reduction talent
---
Maul is great this is true.
---
Bears arent as good as warriors overall sure, but they are viable for nearly all content minus a few bosses as main tanks. 
---
They are easier to gear than warriors, simpler to play while being more flexible (ie you can heal/decurse fights where you dont need to tank). They are the preferred tank for any fight in which threat gen is more important than mitigation
---
hes always in the same patrol path
---
That‚Äôs just being a dick lmao. 5-10 silver is the equivalent of like 5 cents IRL. You don‚Äôt just give someone a nickel.
---
Im playing with 2 friends, a rogue and a priest. I'm playing warrior and I'm wondering what we can do to win wpvp fights, when I engage, our priest is exposed and gets killed easily but if I defend him I'll get kited and killed I think.. Especially in scenarios where they have more players it's hard, what can we do to protect our priest more or win the fights?
---
As with alcohol, some people can play WoW in moderation without neglecting work/school/relationships and other people can't. And if you can't do it moderately you should probably abstain
---
Anything that will give you an additional attack will reset your swing timer. Stuff like sword spec, hand of justice trinket, probably windfury.
---
Someone has problems with authority. It‚Äôs not that deep.
---
Best , simplest explanation right here boys
---
Depends what you are used to.
---
Remember all those Mages, Locks, Hunters and even stuff like Shadowpriests fighting higher level elites, even multiple at once? Better forget that quickly...
---
Rogue leveling is OKish if you go full combat swords, otherwise it's a PITA. As a combat rogue I always felt underpowered compared to other classes. My single target damage might have been top notch, but the amount of damage you receive when you don't have your CDs rdy is enormous.
---
Once every 5 min, you can go ham and even "AoE" 2-4 mobs.   
---
Dots are your bane, you will have to wait additional time for dots to end before engaging the next mob effectively with stealth.
---
On the bright side, you can stealth past annoying enemies and go directly where you want to/leave the place. 
---
It's also pretty satisfying when you get jumped (no stealth, huge disadvantage) by multiple players, but all those 5 min CDs give you the tools you need to kill a few of them, CC the rest and occasionally even make it out alive!
---
Your leveling rotation will look more or less like this:
---
Sinister Strike/Cheap Shot --&gt; Slice and Dice then spam SS and more SnD or Eviscerate (how many CP you depends and if you renew SnD or finish off with Eviscerate depends on how long it takes to kill that enemy). Riposte when ready.
---
Your "AoE" looks like this:
---
Open up with Cheap Shot and Sinister Strike for CP, then sprint and pull a total 2-4 enemies (don't change targets). Kite them a bit so they bunch up, then SnD -&gt; Blade Flurry -&gt; Evasion -&gt; Adrenaline Rush -&gt; Racials/Trinkets -&gt; SS spam and eviscerate before Blade Flurry ends.
---
iirc 300 effective skill guarantees success. Try to get as close to that with baubles/rod/gear/enchant then don't worry about that once you get 300.
---
Jesus... from reading your previous comments I can already tell you‚Äôre a hard headed idiot that doesn‚Äôt know shit about this game or the stats needed for your class. That armor set is shit
---
The only downfall of mage is you're going to have people trying to constantly suck your dick because of how op you are. And as a registered nurse, your intense work schedule might get interrupted quite a bit by all that head
---
Majority or people buying wow tokens are probably the least lazy people who works full time jobs and have about 2 hours to play wow per day and rather do something they want in the game rather than farming gold. At least from what I've seen xd
---
He/she could at least have provided a link and given the credit to the person who provided this information back in 2005? Am I an ass for pointing that out?
---
In raids though?  I thought the majority of tank spots were generally spoken for by the core of any guild you might join and they were a much smaller proportion of numbers than the 1/5 spots whilst dungeoneering.
---
mine ended yesterday not resubscribing cuz i cant find teams during morning times  for dungeons and i dont feel like outside dungeons theres much progression left i might wait a month or so until more people hit 60's including some of my friends and then come back 
---
this game is very much no friendly for introverted solo players
---
If you think TBC classic isn't coming, you're kidding yourself.
---
Doesn't mean there can't be classic+ too.
---
Ah you got me shit good job
---
Then don't spam global channels? The point of banning you is to punish you for breaking a rule. You wouldn't even notice a 30 min silence. A day is impactful enough to make you be more careful. And does your guild not have a discord? You can totally still organize a group with your guild.
---
I hope you're not Alliance on Mograine. As a mage I spent a long time do this the other day to some poor hunters just trying to quest.
---
Gold being limited early on is something we've all come across, for sure.
---
However, investing in larger bags is something that'll pay off after a few levels; with full bags you'd have to refrain from picking up certain vendortrash items, if you had more bag slots you could vendor more stuff and also have an easier life overall. So even if it stings, I'd recommend getting (at least) 12 slots ASAP and possibly 14 slots pre-40, if it's not very overpriced. I think I bought 3x for \~2.5g apiece, and kept a 10 or 12-slotter around until I completed Uldaman and got my 4th 14-slotter from there. 
---
Things to save gold on is not to upgrade Kick, Gouge or get the Wounding poison or Disarm Traps. Might pick up traps later on perhaps. And get that bank alt you can mail over stuff to.
---
mate, the 2 lvl 44 Uld weapons is better than this, seeing he is 55, he can run BRD for a bunch of really great upgrades.
---
Or hell, the lvl 52 blues that sell for &lt; 50g (mostly, at least on my server they are around 30g) that is better like https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16039/takierthan-songblade or the lvl 55 blue https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13053/doombringer
---
don't worry, im not gonna argue with someone that stupid
---
936+base armor of weapon so it's close to 1100 for warden staff. So juicy.
---
One nice thing about the amount of ganking in stv is that it forced me into zones i wouldnt normally quest in. Desolace, duskwallow marsh, feralas,. Weirdly enough hilsbrad wasnt anywhere near as bad as stv
---
And you‚Äôre just an asshole calling this guy an idiot for being courteous. 5-10 silver is nothing and quite frankly an insult.
---
There were people on rooftops doing this stuff all of the time everywhere.
---
Only when you have confirmed a MC raid spot. And I mean CONFIRMED. Even in UBRS, keep BM.
---
Reason being that you actually want your pet to hold aggro to efficiently quest and grind. Going MM makes that less viable and gives you two fewer big CDs to blow (Intimidation/BW).
---
BM also does better for a lot of PvP encounters as you can BW your pet out of fears or sheeps/novas.
---
Drain life is the best spell in the game, fight me.
---
Theirs a comment I posted listing my exact stats needed fuck head read better
---
Blame the streamers. They crashed a toxic meta that the rest of us have to endure now.
---
Streamers are the worst thing to happen to classic.
---
Congrats on 60!
---
This. Put up a 8 hr auction on a Blue BoE at midnight yesterday...
---
Literally get tunic of west fall from killing vancleef and you break the only decent set bonus which is the 10ap.
---
How do you know it's that different from real classic?
---
Worgen should be horde
---
Why do you have to open wounds like that?
---
See that‚Äôs an answer thank you
---
Wait until diremaul comes out and hunters and mages start farming 100g/hour vendoring dungeon drops. There's not enough gold sinks in vanilla either.
---
Make one
---
Leave fishermen alone. Got ganked by a skull horde once while fishing in hillsbrad. I dont even bother to draw a real weapon and just /pity
---
yeah this was brought up last time
---
probably would put a horde hub in the verdant breach, completely redo wildhammer highlands to be more balanced
---
I think what hes saying is weapon dps never makes druids better (compare to say when warriors get Thunderfury or some other insane weapon for threat gen). Only way to up dps is more agi/crit/hit and MCP
---
Boe epics are just gold at the end of the day. He would be stupid to not roll for both.
---
No, community is fine, it's this military organisation/full time job stuff I don't like. I thought the difference was obvious
---
Plus the mutha-stuffin'-barbarshop!
---
I once got a gift (forgot what it was though) for reporting a bug and helping the GM go through solving it (he did the quest with me and did some magic when the quest bugged out to make it work). He logged into my char at some points (making me log on a twink so he could keep whispering me) and it was quite a unique experience (that I totally forgot about).
---
And I never posted about this, there was 0 publicity and they just thanked me thoroughly and gave me a present. Honestly Blizzard CS is pretty awesome unless you get a shitty rep. It happens. But as far as I am concerned Blizzard makes an effort to keep the experience great and it shows (at least here in europe).
---
Like what could they possibly do to appease the people who go "they just do that because PR"?
---
&gt;Either that, or set up your own group where you are the only 1 competing for said item
---
That's what they were doing in your example though.
---
You know this is fake, because in the said article, Blizzard offered a free month pay time! Hell doesn't seem to have frozen over yet. Hahaha
---
So far ive been lucky and noone has bitched about me not being able to hold aggro but as long as dps are fine getting hit a few times its no skin off my teeth
---
Free game time. Nice
---
Good on blizzard
---
I need to put a couple more points into affli for SM. The only okay choices seem to be imp drain life (0/5) or suppression (currently 2/5). I'm draintanking right now,already have grim reach, nightfall, S. Life, amplify curse etc. 
---
Which one should I do?
---
Which dungeons are a must for Warlock?
---
Will the 40lvl mount require any gold?
---
PvP is too random to tell you how to do it. You have to think on the fly of what is best to do. With intimidating shout and psychic scream you could isolate one target and kill him quick then figure out which target is next.
---
I bought a mount at 40 without help! Just double gathered, sold a bit on the AH, and didn't train a bunch of spells.
---
Not as fast as hunter or mage with aoe grind but close, very close. My plan:
---
11-38 improved voidwalker and rest of the points to affliction
---
38..45 drain life with succubus (dark pact)
---
45..60 going to change to soul link since it seems faster than drain life (kill 4-5 same level mobs with succubus out, bandage to full - repeat).
---
Ah shit wow I‚Äôm leaning so much I totally didn‚Äôt know anything about anything and didn‚Äôt know what BoE or BoP was or damn I didn‚Äôt even know what BiS meant till you came along and spares me kind sir. Thank you
---
Outside of the GDPR cases nothing is really deleted these days.
---
With skins I can craft gear I can equip. Mages can't.
---
at lvl 50, it gets far more use, esp vs things like wolves and what nots with much faster attack speed.
---
Imo harder than warriors to level.
---
That GM is a fuckin baller. Huge kudos!
---
2 hand weapon normalization would upscale this to 3.3 speed. Most 2handers are 3.5 speed. You're literally not losing out on much. People overstate the importance of weapon speed.
---
Yikes... You really went through the effort to respond to every one of my comments...
---
Of course it will last. There is nothing at all wrong with reserving, if you don‚Äôt like it you are under no obligation to go.
---
Its not flawed. Just solo grind for a day. The punishment for abusing chat is loss of chat privilege. This is an mmorpg where you really don't need chat to be able to do most things, not a teambased arena game in which the vast majority of gameplay requires some facet of communication.
---
and thats why blizzard remade the loot system later on and gave everyone their own personal loots from drops.
---
because that need or greed system is flawed
---
Sorry if you find my question disturbing. I‚Äôm only asking if that addon exists.
---
I do you one better, when is rexxar?
---
Ignore the idiot, report for harassment, and go about your day. Tell the server he has no proof and he's lying, and it'll be fine. People whining about ninjas without concrete proof get ignored real fast in global channels.
---
I guess one could say you were Sore Out of Luck?
---
Wait...people still play retail? Lol
---
Apparently not if you complain about a lack of content
---
Gratz! Turns out your friend is a trash mage...
---
I'm tired of greedy skinners in dungeons. When were more than 1 Skinner, please leave some for others. I hate the kind of player who just rushes over and skins everything as fast as possible. God forbid someone else gets to skin.
---
I feel like Warlocks are too often glossed over because Mage is the casting hotness and all this newfangled aoe nonsense.
---
Fast levelling, Great PvP, Great utility, Tanky for a Clothie, Soul and healthstones, the succubus noises, scale well into phases, FEAR. Juggling resources and being almost entirely self sufficient is very appealing.
---
What's not to like? I feel like especially in the Class discussion Wednesday threads Warlock is way too overlooked.
---
You realize this is some grade A circular logic though? The reason they released so few servers is BECAUSE layering exists, so they can get away with it.
---
Using that as an argument for layering is just really really dumb.
---
Like what if they just released a single server with 100 layers. Then you'd think that was needed too because imagine our single server with no layers. You see how silly this is?
---
Are you actually that entitled woah
---
More mats availaible = easier/cheaper to level professions = more profession cooldowns. And the servers doesn't house more players because of layering, it just splits them in different instances to avoid bottlenecks.
---
Shout out to Gloom (warlock/gnome) on Whitemane.  Hit me up with some curse of recklessness as a horde hunter making my bow quest a walk in the park after a few attempts
---
People are already getting bored at max level?
---
I'm generally not a fan of improved cleave. The % increase to damage only applies to the bonus damage of cleave. I also use it rarely since it hurts rage generation so much.
---
95 hours on main, \~15 hours on bank/craft alts.
---
This goes so far I'm gonna say no pics no proof.
---
I just refuse to believe someone would be that dumb, feels like some anti-mage propaganda.
---
"Hmm, why can't we have free game time for reporting players too?"
---
Uhhh...
---
So it was because of nickers?
---
Siphon life is all of the fun and none of the commitment
---
Soul Fire for big crit memes though
---
You know that you have to skip "leader of the pack"?
---
Well you have your answer , back to retail you go
---
If you don‚Äôt want to go you don‚Äôt fucking have to. Christ you people are ridiculous. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with reserving items.
---
I for one am surprised by the amount of warlocks in the game, even as Alli. Makes me feel less special
---
Holy fuck you're such a brat LMAO
---
Oh, I got a video for this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPVrWzINvGM  
---
TLDW; it turns into a turn based RPG
---
I haven't had sex since WoW came out.
---
While probably frustrating, you probably spammed LFG quite excessively (at least from my own experience I click my /target macro as much as I can, I can only imagine..) so if you think of it from that perspective it's pretty evidently a spam offense - even if it was a mistake, and an honest one at that. Blizzard does not usually deal with appeals following bans, I assume it's the same for Mutes, and a 24 mute is almost certainly going to be super low priority. 
---
I'd just accept this for what it is and move on, this is one day. 24 hours (-9 now). Grind some mats, do some fishing, farm some rep, or do solo quests around the world or farm some Rugged Leathers. Surely you can't have done all the worthwhile quests already? 
---
Alternatively, you can go on about it in here. I know which option I'd pick.
---
Save the oily blackmouth. FAP usage will go through the roof in p2
---
I like the Diablo style health and mana bars.
---
hmmm like 5 days or so. lvl 41. or was it 3?
---
why am i even writing this post...
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how often this happens, can a conversation with a Hunter in the quest spawn area that went something like this:
---
Hunter: Don‚Äôt kill, don‚Äôt kill... I am trying to tame it!!!!
---
Me: What? 
---
Hunter: The white lion, I‚Äôve been waiting here for hours for it to spawn and people keep coming and killing it!!!
---
Me: Have you got the quest??
---
Hunter: yeah off
---
Me: Have a look in your bag for a horn
---
Hunter: oh shit.... really... erm lol
---
Click....!
---
Guy's on DND tho so can't even whisper him for a good time
---
Yes it was a thing back in vanilla too. No it's not beyond insane. Other people do not owe you to risk a roll, they're free to reserve provided they do so clearly from the get go (none of that right before the boss crap) and you're free to not go with them. It's not that hard to make your own group, you could even advertise "no reservations" to get other like-minded people on your run.
---
If you want the benefit of someone else forming the group and looking for members then you got no claim on what rules they put in place.
---
Need for items you actually gonna use
---
Dont be greedy and ruin others experience just cause you want gold
---
Easy as that
---
If they put a goddamn mailbox next to the AH instead of across the fucking River it may see more use.
---
Start STV at 30??? Do you have a deathwish or something?
---
Uuugh arrrgh
---
Nice hiss.
---
Fury prot tanks with TF can reach druid threat levels, but druids have the best threat gen in the game.
---
 Fury prot is preferred because 
---
1. They can MT all content, there are a few bosses druids shouldn't tank, and a few they cant
---
2. Their threat gen is usually good enough, it's not druid level without TF/Naxx weapons (at which point you're speed running and all content is trivial)
---
3. They can use shields/CDs, consumables, and engineering items. Pretty relevant stuff admittedly
---
Nobody's denying that warriors are the best tanks, few would deny how good fury prot is once geared. Theres no need to go full hyperbole and suggest things that arent true (ie that an average fury tank is going to out threat a druid)
---
How do I deal with rogues when leveling üòí
---
This. See a lot of mages that don't think of this. Ret pally popped freedom? poly him. Someone faps? Poly them. A mage can for the most part just reset the fight whenever they wish.
---
Did I say mages were unbeatable? Nope. Learn to read. Their skill floor is just so low it's a basement
---
This is why BoE Epic is always everyone need unless you're in full guild group or with friends. There's no way to know if the druid was going to use or sell it despite being BIS.
---
Make sure to use a grey fast attack speed weapon so you have more hits on the same mob for a longer time and your pet won't have to growl as often.
---
&gt;I did just fine
---
Per my last email. Stop acting like this game is hard, you're making a fool of yourself.
---
Sure, and I enjoy most PvP interactions I have, just not being autistically chased through 3 zones for 20 minutes of my day because I'm the only honorable kill wanting to do something outside of an instance.
---
Your only protecting this because you've not experienced it, after the first few times its fucking boring. Thank fuck for layering currently.
---
I certainly agree. However, that principle seems to change whenever a highly sought BoE drops.
---
There's supposed to be a difficult curve in these raids. Should they adjust AQ and Naxx as well?
---
I love running through low level zones and just putting Siphon life on players. It's not gonna kill them, but its gonna give you a steady health stream for the next 30s.
---
This is true.
---
I've literally seen people ask for a layer to get away from horde so they can quest in peace. I think if you did that a GM should literally take your character and move you to a PvE realm. Never have a seen a more pussy move.
---
My comment was how easy it is to play a mage, not that they were the #1 best pvp class in every situation
---
Holy fuck I bought a subscription 3 hours ago thinking ill play for maybe 30 minutes max, its 6 am now. Yeah so far I havent had many fun quests but playing as a hunter is kinda fun was told I get pets at level 10 which sounds awesome. One last question, what is the update plan for this game? In osrs its polled and entirely voted by the community, how does blizzard plan on updating this version of the game if ever?
---
17
---
Bullshit, had a lot of fun rooftop camping people back in the day
---
Very well said.
---
Too bad this is so far down in this thread,  more people should read this.
---
 I have only ever played on PvP servers and I have never once found the game unplayable, even on incredibly imbalanced faction servers.
---
I didn‚Äôt take the time to see I was replying to the same person twice I‚Äôm so sorry? I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised that the guy with power issues thinks someone cares about him that much. (No one does)
---
Buy 14 slot bags
---
Can we kill players on the ground and hide on the roof after?
---
In terms of all-around OPness, mage is up there. They can AoE farm for stupid gold and are very powerful in PvP. Locks are also good b/c they can solo-farm mara and are arguably the best 1v1 class in a duel. So you can't go wrong with either of them. Hunters get honorable mention b/c they can solo Mara even easier than locks I think, and are pretty good in PvP. But you won't be AoEing with one, and in late late gear they get outscaled by locks and mages. Plus side is, there are barely any hunters so no gear competition.
---
Congrats to 60 and your Acranist gloves!
---
So, bad tanks are bad. Nothing new. Doesnt matter what gear or spec you give them.
---
wrong weong wrong
---
Its nice to see that you got it overturned dude but I wonder if anyone else got one of these and if it was more to do with your last post that got a lot of attention. The fix is easy, give guards a ranged attack with a BIG knock-back that activates when they can't path to you instead they penalize players for doing something that not really even an exploit.
---
How
---
This is some Picasso shit, right there.
---
lol theres tons of people who farm maraudon solo generating 10-15 gold every run  for hours everyday  , tons of aoe cleave groups who generate tons of resources on gold
---
i alone already farmed over 4k  and i wasnt even trying that hard
---
Get it. Bunch of people commenting, who I assume are healers, don‚Äôt realize how good that is for a rogue. Check out shadowpanther they list it as one of the best mail hands for rogues until thrashblade. I had it until I upgraded to thrashblade. Way more dps than sword of Omen and still more than vanquishers.
---
yes in retail - this chat restriction works fine since there are alternatives to finding a group aka dungeon finder.
---
this doesnt work in classic since theres no dungeon finder and no way to talk to anyone to find a group
---
Lol wut? Gaming is all about wasting time doing something you enjoy. 
---
Fuck risk, fuck reward when all you achieve can be achieved in mere minutes by a game master. If i wanted to suffer i would go out and try to achieve something meaningful.
---
the servers host an equal amount of players relative to available material compared to vanilla wow  
---
if you compare with with private servers with a massivly increased capacity, indeed materials appear more abundant
---
&gt; Paladins just auto attack 
---
HEARD YOU TALKING SHIT ABOUT OUR SEAL TWISTING RECKBOMBING AOE-FARMING MASTERCLASS!
---
Need if you plan to equip for main spec. Otherwise greed you filthy ninja
---
Thanks for the reply. I think I‚Äôll just continue with the guide then, at least killing things is easy as I‚Äôm often killing stuff 2-4 levels below me.
---
You can go and do something else elsewhere yes, but some times you are doing a chain that sends you to the other side of the world and you find yourself camped by enemy players. Yes I can go back and do something else but I've already wasted 15min getting there and I have to do the quest at one point if I want to continue my chain.
---
You missed my point though, I myself haven't had too much issues with this. If it happens to me I just take my revenge whenever I can. But there are times you simply want to do a specific quest or farm some stuff and you just can't. I'm just venting I know what I would get into on a pvp server
---
solo grind what? im lv60. the only thing to grind is BiS which is all in dungeons / raids
---
As long as your wow is updated it really does not take much data, like 50mb or so per hour to play it.
---
He could ha provided a link to the original comment from 2005 or given credit to the author.
---
I remember seeing somewhere here a link to a site that showed BiS during levelling.... but I can‚Äôt remember what it was. Any ideas?
---
Preach. I fully agree with this statement based on my experiences thus far
---
irl friend guild. not many ppl 60s
---
And a free month, what a nice way to fix the situation
---
Right now
---
Not impressive, mages are so free to play
---
There's literally zero incentive outside of achievements to raid a capital though so that's a rather bad example.
---
I know right. It's like everyone in world has access to a highly skilled, Architect, Designer, Tailor and Craftsman. I mean the Scarlett Monastery is looked in one of the most deprived zones with little access to resources. Yes they don't seem to struggle in Tirisfall Glades.
---
Where do the cultists of the Damned get those cloths.
---
Where do the Defias get those bandanas
---
Sometimes everyone seems full of resources and knowledge.
---
Now all the people in the first post accusing OP and others defending OP of ‚Äútrying to get that GM in trouble because you want to exploit‚Äù look like idiots :D
---
Right.....now....
---
Then dont fucking soam the dungeon. Join a discord chanel or something and get a group that way. Jeesus crist man . You spammed, got reported and banned from chat. Dont spam and you will be able to join. You can also quest for that day, go fishing, grind sime mibs and professions. Stop crying that you got what you deserved
---
Why not just sell them on the regular AH?
---
You should use a Zoidberg noises macro when you run away.
---
I wouldn't be able to resist the urge to stream snipe.
---
My experience of playing wow on phone internet is about 10 mb/hour. But count on 50 to play it safe.
---
I was playing mage for years and this "spellcleave" is the biggest cancer imaginable. It's not that I can't run this setup, I just don't want to. You still need to drink after each group and you run the dungeon only marginally faster than if you were just killing it the normal way, but now you also have an added benefit of single mistake wiping your group and having you corpse run. 
---
Can't imagine anyone farming dungeons for xp this way either. Or I can, I just can't imagine anyone wanting to play that game afterwards ever again.
---
Second this, fed up with only spellcleave groups for dungeons
---
I‚Äôm only at level 31, is it feasible to not use a shield for trash pulls and pull out the shield for bosses? Rage generation is so much better with higher damage..
---
pug run = all need on expensive/purple items to avoid ninja issues
---
guild run = discuss beforehand, but if you are actually going to equip and item and they try to take it from you go get a new guild.
---
Also always discuss before the run starts for a pug. Always.
---
If you're drain tanking I'd say go for the imp drain life.
---
As you approach 40, dungeons will have spell power more regularly, that's what you want. If you find any world drops with "shadow wrath" in the title even better. Stack that damage as much as possible.
---
Lvl40 mount costs 0 gold, just gotta speak to someone at  Ratchet.
---
Rather than being silenced completely the moves that warriors/rogues/mages are using lock out a particular school of magic for a duration. For example, if you are using drain life and a mage counter spells you, you won't be able to use your affliction spells for a time but you will still have access to your destruction ones.
---
I'm no expert but I hope this was helpful!
---
Get an addon that lists vendor prices.  this way when you do need to trash some trash to make room, you can be sure that you trash the least valuable items.   Especially with grey animal parts it's often quite random , one part may be 80c and another part of the same beast may be 5s each.
---
Eh..i played hunter in vanilla. I was a young kid but still..deadzone is a pain lol
---
Is this legal? Is using chrome remote desktop to play from my phone ok too??
---
What‚Äôs more effective is jumping and switching directions. It makes you run just as fast as if you were running in a straight line backwards but you don‚Äôt show them your back
---
We would exploit that also haha
---
Best talent build for dungeons at lower levels? Like 30-45? Should I go straight for SM or is there any point in putting points in destruction? 
---
Also, can someone explain the thing about suppression not being worth putting more than 3 points to? Or is that just when leveling and fighting mobs at your level or under.
---
Fair dude. I like SS and cleave for dungeon clears (horde+windfury), tyvm
---
Except hunters maybe. Until 10 they have a stupidly hard time without the pet imo
---
For the rest of the group
---
can u do the maths and calculate this in spellcleave runs ?
---
if thats what you think a ninja is you're gonna be quitting this game by this time next week
---
I'm 35 atm and leveling feels like hell. In terms of questing there doesn't seem to be anywhere that's consistent enough to stay in an area too long and there's always raiding parties killing everyone which slows it down so much.
---
Originally it was useable in the 2.0 prepatch of tbc but then blizzard made it into a lvl 66 ability so no it's not obtainable
---
i think its called luna unit frames.
---
&gt;Fear mechanics
---
Polymorph mechanics. Disarm mechanics. Alliance has it easier, of course (fear ward&gt;&gt;&gt;tremor totem).   
---
&gt;  Weapon damage doesnt improve their threat 
---
But it still scales much better than warrior\`s.  Warrior\`s threat from Sunder armor is white damage\*1,17 (90% damage but 130% threat from defensive stance)+261. and that '+261" part doesn't scale, no matter what you do and how your damage changes. Druid deals white damage\*2,275 with swipe and all of his TPS scales with crit chance from buffs/enchants/etc. Maul threat also scales with attack power.  
---
&gt;  When warriors get BIG improvements 
---
Their damage still sucks with just a 1-hander and 0 damage talents. Their mitigations go through the roof, however. That's why tanks often choose to respec to fury when they get enough t3 gear. Unless we\`re talking Thunderfury vs Atiesh (which 99% of tanks won't have anyways) - weapon is not a factor
---
Actually I'd argue it's the hardest class to level in classic because you can't just tank a dungeon cleave group.   
---
As a rogue you can join some melee cleave groups but those are very rare and warriors would rather join spell cleave.   
---
So you're forced to regular dungeon groups and otherwise questing. I've leveled on a server where my faction was outnumbered quite heavily so that's obviously made it even worse. But I'd say even without that element, rogue is probably the hardest/slowest class to level in on 1.13.   
---
It's easier with an alt because you can constantly feed it gear, but as a first char it's pretty terrible.
---
Lmao you literally just stole this from OSRS Sub
---
#NotMyClassic
---
Sometimes I understand that people want to play most OP Meta evaluated on pservers/beta no matter the class. I wanted to start a mage, because I love that role in Heroes of the Storm, but desided to go along with my vanilla main - feral druid for now.
---
Edgemaster's as well as Aged Core Leather Gloves (gives Dagger skill, tanks often use daggers endgame).
---
Even when focusing on drain tanking, imp drain life offers very minimal returns for such a huge point investment.
---
Suppression will make you much, much stronger than most other classes against red mobs. I leveled alongside some melee friends and they would barely be able to do anything against such enemies while I would melt them pretty easily. Supposedly it also decreases the chance of fear breaking early but I can't confirm that.
---
SM library is good for the spell damage dagger, which pairs excellently with the warlock quest +shadow damage offhand you get at around level 30. Nothing else really stands out, since very little dungeon gear gives spellpower. The +crit sword from maraudon is great but while leveling, most of your damage comes from sources that cannot crit.
---
As mentioned, that offhand you can get at around level 30 is great, though you can substitute it with the one from SM graveyard.
---
It's free.
---
If they interrupt a shadow spell, all of your shadow spells will be unavailable. If they interrupt a fire spell, all of your fire spells will be unavailable. Most of your spells are shadow. The only ones that aren't are hellfire, rain of fire, searing pain, soulfire, conflag, and immolate. Maybe something like summon infernal or create firestone count but that's not really relevant.
---
&gt;I see this spellcleave as and attempt to treat classic like retail and I suspect it won't work.
---
I totally agree. I can't remember most of the dungeons and am just enjoying running them at a normal pace.
---
Healer in DPS spec doesnt make any more threat than in heal spec. They just go oom faster. :P If a heal crits, any part thats overhealing will cause 0 threat.
---
I can download but downloading doesn't save the animation as a gif, and the other two don't save properly to use as a live wallpaper :(
---
Seduce them and go max range. Shadowbolt, immolate, amp curse of agony, corruption, siphon life, coil, fear.
---
&gt;But who is the one to decide what amount of gold is enough to allow this?
---
It wouldn't be an issue at all if literally everyone rolled need on all boes.  Why does it matter if its worth 50s or 500g?  If some green boe worth 50s is an upgrade for someone in the group they can buy it off the winner.
---
This is fair and makes ninjaing a boe not possible.
---
Lol as much as i love Classic and world pvp the "hardcore" community is toxic as fuck. I feel like you guys are trying to relieve your teens because everything was downhill from then on.

---
I had about 70-75g at level 37, I'm very close to level 40 now with 95g and ready to get that mount. Getting gold really speeds up close to 40 as quest rewards regularly vendor for 1g or more and you're mostly mining iron and mithril, which is a lot more valuable than that tin/copper shit you were getting in the 20s.
---
Honestly I disagree, mi first char is a rogue and getting bis weapons in a few lv brackets makes leveling easy even with trash armor due to my lack of luck.
---
But everything is cheap now, so gold is worth more now than later when you plan to sell your eels, oils, etc.

Succubus is more ezmode in my experience, because she deals more damage and provides a handy cc ability.

Did a rogue hurt you?

Wouldn't your guildie remember if they had a 48 shaman with them in there? I most certainly would have reacted, since you have no business there at that level, except maybe if you're a healer. Shamans, unless Resto specced, well geared and chugging potions, would have a very hard time keeping people alive in there at level 48 unless the rest of the group were all quite a few levels higher. 
---
Overall it sounds very shady. If someone indeed did ninja something in one of my runs I'd have screenshots of the whole damned ordeal for sure, no matter how upset I was during that time. If you trust your guild member I don't see why you should try to do anything except defend him, as there seems to be no other evidence than the word of this frustrated druid who behaves quite immaturely and tries to call a level 48 "witness".
---
Lol good luck hitting someone 15 levels higher let alone being able to do any significant damage before they burst your shit out of your ass.
---
While he wasn't exactly being nice, the irony is that you're really the dick here for telling people go back to retail.

And as other people have pointed out, what he did is more classic than this high horse you're riding.

The optimised raid composition have a bit of everything. Also, currently druid tanks &gt; warriors tanks, thanks to being in 1.12 (with TRIPLE the armor bonus they add in vanilla at this time) and stupid gear scaling (some lvl 58 green items are better for feral tank than AQ40's loots). 
---
And anyway, you don't need an optimised roster to clean raids as for now. Pugs groups faceroll on onyxia and ragnaros while being 23/24. They sometime kill them so fast that the boss don't even have the time to reach one of its phase.
---
As long as you have 40 peoples (and having the 40 players IS the biggest difficulty of a raid) with a few tank and healers, you won't have any problem to down any current raids. People wanting optimized spec and nothing else are idiots.
---
If the constant gank fest at the entry to brd is something to go by... yep
---
Warden staff is quite imba stats for a bear druid, no question about it. But there is also AQ40's Blessed Qiraji War Hammer - https://classicdb.ch/?item=21268
---
Its mainhand too, so you can use some offhand to get even more stats.
---
No matter the spec, all priests can heal. Healing as shadow just means you have to play smarter. :) Back in Vanilla, healers were rare and  weren't all reading guides about optimizing. Groups were just happy to find a priest (aka a healer).. not the case today! :( 
---
Regardless, shadow priests have all the same tools to heal, just 0.5 sec longer heals, and the heals are slightly weaker that deep holy. basically the same strength as a deep disc priest.
---
14 pts in disc gives you inner focus and meditaion. And you'll have at least 13 disc for meditation as an spriest eventually. and the same healing toolbox as holy or disc priest.
---
Yeah, good for you. You got lucky and transferred to a server that is heavily populated with your faction. I came here as a horde and I hate it. I wish I had never transferred there.
---
To all the Layer Haters.

The game is not designet for such a big servers. We need Layers, or else there will be 50 players for 1 plant, for 1 mob etc.

If you do not understand the technical necessity for something, it does not means, that it is bad.
---
WoW zones were not designed for that amount of players, the servers are having right now !
---
I recommend Lord Alexander's Battle Axe if you can get it cheap. I went from WW to this and its been doing well for me, though I'm only 53. I picked mine up for around 30g.
---
Looks more like a misinformation post to rile up the vocal, stupid minority of this sub
---
Teldrasil looks like a anus aswell.
---
If they dont want players on the roof, patch it out of the game. They already stated they would not reimplement bugs back into the game, and if they dont want players doing this they need to patch it out, not hand out warnings/suspensions.
---
And they can sell them and buy gear they can equip. Same fucking result.
---
got any source for that number?
---
I'm not sure if I will resub. The biggest issue is actually the amount of people on the server and that I feel im forced into dungeons since every damn quest is camped by 10 people.
---
(got stuck on Gehennas since my friends didnt wanna switch)
---
If it's an upgrade for a certain class it shouldn't matter if it's BoE or BoP. Same goes for the recipes - if you can learn it right there and then - Need. Otherwise it's always a Greed roll.
---
Playing with PUGs can cause confusion and disagreement, so best if you are the party leader to enable Master Looter.
---
Back 13 years ago, when it was still fresh and new, we would offer the party compensation for any BoE item they could've rolled Need. But that was for guild-only groups.
---
Can you explain why succ over voidwalker? I am 58 lock and have been using void all the way. I quite like having one mob on my void with dots and doing a 2nd mob myself with fear/just facetank
---
As an alliance warlock I beat a lot of rogues when they jump me, granted a lot of them are bad. 
---
When they cs you, seduce them and soulfire/shadow bolt, if they wotf out of seduce, then deathcoil them, and fear them right after. Dot em up asap after seduce to prevent vanish and then spam drain life (try and bait kick too). Drain tank spec is pretty nuts in PvP.

If the rogue is really good though it's generally gonna be a GG for them.

The original poster must be seething at the amount of juicy credit they are missing out on
---
I have a group consisting of a feral druid tank, holy paladin and me warlock. How would I best spec to complement the group while leveling? Drain tanking is king for solo, but in a group I feel stuff dies so fast that my dots don't have time to tick through, same goes for dungeons, my dps feels really low due to lack of burst.
---
You could pick up fishing and fish for Loot Trunks (mostly fished at Floating Wreckages). Among silver, greens and potions these Trunks often contain Bolts of Cloth and Leather. With these you can ask a Tailor to craft you bags. 
---
I'm not sure if this is suitable for your level though. I think 4x 10 slot bag at level 16 is quite advanced already. 
---
I am level 38 and just got 3x 14 slot bags this way (one of my Trunks even contained a 14 slot bag, the other two a Tailor crafted for me). My fourth bag slot is my quiver.
---
Reserve is big gay

not what i Remember, also from the countless of movies, clearly shows how blizzard works and how close you could be to the mobs before getting hit, not classic like sadly.

Dude I have played both pve and pvp servers you don't have to keep stating the obvious. I'm saying I'm just venting here...
---
who is the most fuckable warlock in lore?
---
We had a warlock tank it for shits n giggles
---
Try to think of tanking as something different. Tanking is asymptotic, you can get very close to perfect, but you should never reach it.
---
If you are tanking every single mob, and never losing aggro, then that means the DPS is not doing as much damage as they could be, and therefore you are clearing the dungeon slower than you could.
---
Therefore DPS will be constantly testing their DPS vs your aggro, and they should be pulling sometimes when they get a few crits or when they can handle it.
---
To be philosophical for a moment, I think people who play games often get obsessed with playing optimally, in the context of tanking, they consider it a serious blow to that illusion that everything is going smoothly if a mob is attacking someone else.
---
I don't know if for you it's an ego thing, or feeling like your failing your group, or just upsetting the "correctness" of how the tank should be the one getting hit, but it really is fine if you don't hold aggro on every mob, it can be more efficient for the group if, say, two phys DPS burn down a caster mob quickly and you just don't bother tanking it.
---
It's OK to not be the only one being hit, other classes can handle themselves, and if they can't, that's also not your fault.
---
One thing to do, is just mark a skull that you know might go down fast (casters are great for this) and doesn't have any ability that might make life hard for a DPS being hit by it, and just let all 3 of the DPS zerg it, while you focus on the rest of a pack.
---
i meant second day* haha. just got off 12hr shift... or in my brain a ~6 second shift
---
agreed. too many shitheads who can't play, decline party invites ("hurr durr it's gonna take more time to gather those bear asses!" so what? are you in a fucking hurry?), leave parties over minor inconveniences/conflicts, don't help in world pvp... it's quite bad.

Decided to make a warlock alt on alliance. I am die hard fan of Ironforge/Dwarven master race. As a warlock on alliance my options are limited to humans and gnomes. 
---
* On one hand, we have mini-dwarves, on the other hand they are gnomes.... and nobody wants to play a gnome
---
* Humans were never really on my fantasy radar but they are not gnomes.
---
From wpvp perspective, escape artist will certainly be an asset. Looks like gnomes are better on paper and they kind of fit into my Ironforge fan club. However, who is better suited to a warlock class lore wise? and is there an undeniable benefit of one race over the other.
---
I'm a druid, and I approve of this message.
---
We always need more druids.

What is Rexxar?

The other disadvantages of bear are that you can't break fear which is important on many fights, they require more healing, and they can't use items in form.
---
However, we have a really good bear Druid who also heals when it makes sense and he is definitely a valued member of the raid.

no you're not an ass for saying that, the other is for what he said though

A dwarf priest was trying to escort that goblin chick out of the centaur camp in desolance. So I moved in to help him as an orc warlock. We finished the escort. He thanked me. I welcomed him, wave bye then used fear on him to watch him run around on his little dwarf legs abit and walked away.

I accidently hit a horde in Booty Bay, which obviously got me killed by the guards around me. After that NPC‚Äôs have had their info stripped.

This happend days ago and the problem still active, any help?

That is how some hardcore guilds did it back in the day as well. Well, I've only heard it from a couple people who played back then.

There are tailoring stuff that require leather.

Mana burn is even better but you need to reroll for that.

It feels very disingenuous to refer to armour as druids' "defense skill" substitute without even mentioning crushing blows or how they work.
---
Hell at the one point you mention it you're lumping in crushings and crits as being mitigated by armour, when crushing blows ignore armour entirely and is the bane of feral druids. 
---
Don't misunderstand, I agree with bears being viable and in some cases perferable tanks, but your reasoning is wrong. 
---
Druids thing is spell/special attack damage, spell because they sacrifice a lot less than warriors substituting gear for resistance pieces in most cases, and special attacks like brood lords mortal strike as they cannot crit or crush, and are as such always mitigated by the high armour and hp pool of the druid. There's also the threat point in which you're right barring a dw fury tank or thunderfury.
---
 But no reliable way of getting +defense skill means that what you think druids are great for intuitively, high physical damage attacking bosses, is in fact their greatest weak point. As opposed to shield block making defense more or less redundant for the warrior in regards to hard hitting bosses because it removes your chance to be crit and crushed
---
I am pretty sure even the alliance doesn't have "dps" pallies :D
---
Everyone deserves a fair chance at getting the fat gold payout when your group runs into a jackpot.
---
That druid is a dick. If he really wanted the staff, he should've asked for a trade. Or maybe ask your guildie to keep it until he gets enough to pay for it, if he lacks the gold.
---
Haha, the EXACT same thing happened to my gf. She got so mad she was about to stop playing. So i asked which quest she was doing... ‚ÄûEcheyakee‚Äú
---
I laughed and told her to use the horn.
---
Still mad, she told me that she had no horn and she knew what she was doing.
---
After a while, she came to me ‚ÄûSorry, you were right. But how the fuck do you know every quest by heart ?‚Äú
---
Cause I‚Äòm a hunter and everybody loves a white lion. Also, read the quest, girl.
---
She is lvl20 now and is doing better :)
---
Every guild should just look for any level 55+ who says they're ready to have fun in raids I guess

This sounds more like BC advice for Bear tanks, it's all about Maul in classic.
---
Thats an awesome UI!
---
&gt; Warrior`s threat from Sunder armor is..
---
Well, warriors tanks threat is NOT coming from sunders. If we are talking raiding, its the DPS warriors job to stack sunders, anyways.
---
Lets see how the meta goes, in private servers all tanks went fury in BWL the latest, pulled bosses with death wish, didnt take armor talents for more rage etcetc.
---
You are surely going to see a LOT more TF's, since it drops way earlier than in vanilla. There are way more PUG runs where its reserved. People do multiple runs to have chance to get it for all of their tanks. Atiesh is still going to be as rare as ever. Maybe more ppl run naxx, but gathering the splinters will take quite a while still.
---
Did you say nvm and hold your consumables for another raid, because screw that
---
on the other hand wouldn't that be the same as rolling need on every BoP because you can sell it for 50s too ?
---
thanks for the PTSD attack
---
BoE = need
---
BoP = greed
---
As a tank my experience is exactly the same. Alot of people doesn't seem to realise that for cleave group to actually be effective you have to actually know what you are doing but people still just keep talking about the supposed xp/h. But a smooth normal group will beat a  mediocre cleave group everytime.
---
If I made a top 5 list of the smoothest and fastest runs I've done you would not find a cleave group on that list.
---
I'd also like WoW Classic to have its own launch code so you can make a steam shortcut for it that goes through battlenet (so you don't have to login.)

On whitemane good luck getting 2g for a stack our markets terrible.

The Warlock quest orb from lvl 35 iirc + hypnotic blade from SM is a great combo. I‚Äôm still using it at lvl 53.
---
Besides that shadoweave set is great and later from lvl 50+ you can start getting the Felcloth set.
---
Since you don‚Äôt have to use any money for your 40 Mount you can spend some on items like shadoweave.
---
Don‚Äôt bother getting the lvl 30 Warlock chest, you will replace it with the shadoweave chest anyway.
---
And yes! Your 40 mount is free and super easy to get. Click-go to Ratchet-click-mount!
---
They are interrupting you so you can‚Äôt use the school of magic you were using when the interrupt happened, in your case most of your spells is shadow. If you‚Äôre foreseeing an interrupt try and channel immolate so you get looked out from fire instead of shadow. Otherwise you can use instant casts if you know their interrupts is off cooldown.
---
If you‚Äôre super leet you can do a hearthstone juke and hope they fall for it, you start channel HS and hope they will waste their interrupt on that.

Greetings from &lt;Undertuned&gt; good job guys :D

Sorry I misunderstood . Good Friday!

You could always chat using emote if someone is in close proximity
---
&gt;!RemindMe 1 day
---
How did this happend?
---
Agree, I remember I helped out a guild (that had declined a previous app from my and said I was blacklisted, but their MT liked me..) on ToGC, my BiS trinket dropped, I rolled and they actually gave it to me, but said "normally we wouldn't do this" yes but you're having to pug for dps slots so...
---
Half of 99 is 92
---
They're bad at leveling, if you have a higher lvl main with some gold however then its a completely different ballgame as you can max first aid which helps a lot and kinda make them great.
---
HAHAHA
---
Is Blizzard considering making a balance pass if people would ask for it loudly enough, or is that completely out of question?
---
If there was a feral druid tanking the run, I‚Äôd be happy to pass it to him, but people are jerks, so I‚Äôd still roll need on it and give it to the feral on the condition that he equips it.
---
In PuGs the greed is real and someone will definitely ninja a BoE if given the chance.
---
Golemagg is around 30 mins q starting from 18:00 PM cet down from 4 hours is quite good

Game is already starting to die imo. The hype is gone.

When is Rexxar? (Dark? Anyone?)
---
Why should you be punished for soamming? Jesus crist karen grow up

Atleast in Gehennas EU Horde I have managed to sell each one of my cooldowns for tips between 6-8 golds. There‚Äôs alot of people in trade channels just spamming to buy it
---
Or 1 arrow, so frustrating to shoot your bow and in comes all the aoe, its usually fresh 60's or close to 60. I love doing dungeons even with pugs but these people are going to force me to run guild/friendslist only groups.
---
And they never listen, also holy paladins doing dmg in strat/scholo and drinking after every pull get in my nerf real quick, i need the dps to drink not my healer  need those 3 seconds alone with my mobs.
---
They're still there, we just.. skin them.

MC has no cooldown. WOTF does. Get off the boat.
---
shitty meme saying layering is bad. To the front page!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Any class is "easy" if you completely ignore the element of speed which you seem to do.   
---
If you look at the class without factoring in all the others then sure, rogue is easy and fast enough.  
---
If you then look at the other classes you realize it's slower than all of them. The old S tier was Hunter and Warlock. On classic that includes Mages. But dungeon cleaving also boosted priests and warriors speed. Druids and shamans get ghost wolf and cat speed respectively around 20 taking a fair chunk off of their leveling speed.   
---
Post 40 Rogues and shamans are probably around the same speed but 20-40 shaman is a lot faster.
---
So what are we left with? Paladins and Rogues. In terms of speed they're probably pretty close, even though there are some great guides for pallies out there. But in terms of difficulty it doesn't get easier than a paladin.  
---
So the way I look at it, rogues are the "worst" class to level. I never said it was difficult, no class is. It's just the worst of the bunch. But please do argue why I'm wrong.
---
The run between two mobs without agro them is too real... and you always do..
---
gnome is the right answer unfortunately. sorry.
---
I can only play three days a week 2-3 hours a day max between my engineering studies, theater classes and gym. Its sad i have to alt-f4 only fifteen minutes in because someone who has nothing better to do decides to camp leveling areas.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Wait did you actually just comment this right after acknowledging that you have rep to grind
---
Hi :)
---
That‚Äôs beyond idiotic, I don‚Äôt remember that at all in Vanilla but I tended to avoid those type of players as much as I could.
---
I 100% condone this.
---
I play on Skeram and try to go a non-aggressive route.  I'll bail Alliance players out of trouble, help them kill quest mobs ... but turn on me and I'll fucking cut you ^(or at least I'll try)
---
Always mailed a warlock, mostly because a friend recommended I try one back when I only played on his account. They're fairly powerful in a wide number of ways and get a lot of decent perks. Free health potions for eternity, free first mount...I can even be one as a gnome, the only race worth playing.

Unless I see a blue post on forums saying it‚Äôs ok to wall hack onto that roof I call bullshit.
---
So what is the halfway point then to 60?
---
And my retail toon has 500,000 gold lol.
---
No, class quests pre-20 are restricted by race for the most part.
---
disease spec mages i tend to call them.
---
Yeah, I remember class runs from back then... 7-8 people of different class doing a dungeon; T0 sets were implied to be reserved for your class
---
You may now be marked as "at war" with Goblins at Booty Bay. Go to the reputation tab on the character screen.  You can decide to be at war with a number of factions, although I'm not sure if it automatically ticks if you get in a fight with the guards.
---
Hi there
---
Just a heads up
---
CVAR useUIscale also needs to be set to 1
---
Come on man üôÑstupidly hard? I feel like "you might die a couple times" is more on point
---
Our AoE is about as horrendous as a warrior's, yeah.
---
I think his point is that damage taken is not always a good indicator of tank performance. Putting an arbitrary number on damage taken doesn't exactly tell the whole story.
---
Can you imagine how many reports Blizzard gets daily of people 'ninja looting' epic boe drops?  It's people who want their fantasy gear but aren't prepared to work for it.
---
It's also the issue with the fact its 1.12 blizzard decided to release, and they didnt roll back the nerfs on raids they made in that patch originally. Therefore they made lvl60 dungeons irrelevant.
---
That‚Äôs a totally different argument though. That‚Äôs simply not trusting who you are with. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt change the definitions of the words. If you are needing all BOE items because you don‚Äôt trust who you are with it shouldn‚Äôt matter what the item is worth to ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô a need roll.
---
If a main tank got arrested, a guild would chip in for a lawyer so the tank could get internet access during raid hours in his jail cell.
---
Main tanks are truly the privileged class.
---
There are a few addons, and this isn‚Äôt what he‚Äôs using, bust ansi ui has that hotbar as one of its features. You can search on willitclassic, wowinterface, curse, lots of places
---
pvp isn't particularly rewarding even with honor unless you completely no-life it to get the epic gear, which will be even harder this time around.
---
If you really feel like dying on a hill this morning you do you.  Some servers are 70.30. You are wrong. Get over it.
---
I've had several arguments in lower level dungeons on this, rolling need on spirit.   
---
People take it far too seriously and I had just as much case to roll need
---
&gt;Technically best for threat
---
no way, mon
---
3 points (6%) takes you to the hit cap for mobs +2 levels above you. +3 levels requires 16% so you won't reach that anyway so why bother. 
---
Obviously it does help being at 10% so it is whether you feel it is worth those extra 2 points for +3 level mobs.
---
I'll leave this here for anyone interested. You can read all about it here:

That discord is also nice if you have more questions.

i loved all the cools and situationnal and sometime useless abilities of every class.
---
You can try. Most pets have 3000+ hp with 50% physical damage reduction from armor. It isnt dying in an MC.
---
It‚Äôs kind of funny how thought classic would erase the lfr mentality

Are druids back to: "eating all the bosses attacks? Cos I might reroll now

Wholesome

The Scarlet Crusade used to be a completely legitimate organization, the Cult of the Damned had many ex-Kirin Tor members, and the Defias was full of skilled tradesmen. As for how the Scarlet Crusade has managed to keep themselves afloat for so long, that's where it really gets weird. The Scarlet Crusade's power level has greatly fluctuated throughout WoW and it's evident even in Classic. They're powerful enough to control Hearthglen and the Scarlet Monastery in a land full of aggressive Horde and the Scourge, but a random questgiver in Southshore tells a random adventurer offhand to go in and wipe them all of their leaders out in the Monastery? What?
---
Different sets of armor sounds great on paper, not so much in reality. Hunter is the only class with ranged, but also melee and some minor magic.
---
I am not sure if Rexxar is allowed name for player.
---
Its because everyone is leveling and farming gear etc. Phase 2 will be a shitshow
---
As a druid, if an enemy druid ever attacks me I start casting Moonglade Portal to show them we're both friends of nature.
---
Nooooo
---
Pallies do.
---
Yep, I've got a macro that runs explaining loot rules and target marks.
---
Sounds like complete cancer to do amongst 40 people.
---
That's just rude. The unwritten rule for non-sociopaths is: if you're first to mine it or you're fighting a mob next to it, it's yours.
---
Unless of course it's the opposite faction. Then you just murder them and steal it.
---
During WotLK I had a druid decked out in raid-viable gear for: Feral DPS, Feral Tanking, Boomkin and Healing - I'd just fill whatever role was needed, was great fun :)
---
The unwritten rule is you don't touch tagged veins, since it's unwritten people don't have to follow it.
---
You're telling everyone to roll last?
---
I need multiple sources from different guilds.
---
bUT i wAnT tO pLaY lIkE a StrEEmer!!!!
---
Still not sure what the big deal was over the warning. If it was a ban, for any length of time, then I get it. But... a warning doesn‚Äôt really affect you in any way?
---
Since u can login on your char, use spells, eat, drink, mount u literally can play but not chat..
---
Working as intended i guess..
---
Is it really that hard to understand?
---
It's too fast for pala
---
People are really desperate for healers these days
---
It's, in fact, the main crux of the argument of rolling need. If I'm with my guild I have no problem passing if someone needs. If it's random pugs I don't trust them further than I can throw them.
---
I can't talk for the other guy, but I never log in if I already know that I only have 30 minutes. Why would I? If I need to take a flight to get where I actually was questing, half of my time is already up without doing anything.
---
What is a balance pass?
---
You don't lose reputation for killing players or being killed by guards, most likely a bug.
---
So much so that I actually did the Succubus quest twice on Org and UC trainers.
---
That makes a lot of sense
---
I wish I was at war with them because then atleast I could fix it myself, but other NPC‚Äôs are also affected like Stormwind, ironforge etc(also edited my post)
---
Vol-chan lmao, i wonder if vanilla creators were bunch of weebs.
---
So you‚Äôd say a hunter gives the best main feeling? That‚Äôs interesting! I thought paladin/druid would have the upper hand, but it seems you‚Äôve made a good point mate
---
The only dying happening apparently was you at the spirit healer.
---
Nerf frost mages, leave everything as is.
---
Ive seen some Rexxarr or Rexxxar but you are right, Rexxar is not allowed.
---
Onyxia is like a 30min affair. From raid invites go out in Org to distributing loot. MC needs a couple of hours. 
---
But it's fair to remember that the people who are raiding now have already hit 60. Even someone who put in 4 hours a day will still need 6-8 weeks to hit 60.
---
The absolute number 1 priority is to sure you always keeping track of where your next weapon is coming from and stay on top of it, seriously. Even waiting two levels after you're due an upgrade can be a slog.
---
As soon as you're min level for a dungeon quest that offers a nice sword (pretty much every dungeon from 25-50 has one or a nice drop from a boss), get in there and do it asap.
---
It helps if you've got a friend higher level who can quickly run you through it.
---
What are the flaws?
---
Ok.kiddo
---
Lol buddy, a fury warrior can't even keep up with a bears auto attacks ur high friend
---
Rectal Nibbler
---
Ah yes, being one-shot by a lvl 60 every time you land on a flight path as a lvl 45 because he just wants to farm his honor is definitely what being on a pvp server is about.
---
Check your reputation tab to see if your reputation with Booty Bay has changed.
---
No, pet points go up with each trust level. He'll gain all of the points he would've gained per level as it rises.
---
Started the fight as a dps, but after our tank lost aggro and couldn't get it back #ProtPaladinLife, the boss killed the healer so I had to start healing instead. Unfortunately, I ran out of mana, so everyone else started dying one by one until I was the only one left alive. In the end, I used Divine Shield at 10% hp and managed to deliver the killing blow.
---
Doesn't bother me too much as long as they don't go out of control with it. Balance changes were classic. The vast majority of vanilla was not 1.12 anyways, it's not like this specific patch is the word of god.
---
Warriors frequently don't get ret aura because they tank without a shield/half leathers. But yes, salvation is always useful.
---
That lw turtles scale stuff is sweet. 10 int spirt and stam
---
&gt;wasted 15min getting there
---
I know this feeling, best solution is to just log onto your Alt for an hour or so :)
---
I was running SFK and we had a pat come up on us on the stairs, so as the tank I grab aggro so my team can focus them down. I didn't realize mages abilites were tied to how many enemies were there, because the mage said something along the lines of "I'm not wasting mana on two mobs, pull more"... ok? I'll just run these two up to the top of the staircase, grab the boss and his mobs, and bring them back down for you so you can spell cleave.
---
They always complain about the pull size. If the healer isn't finishing with 0 mana and the rest of the party is over 50% hp, we obviously didn't pull enough. If you wipe though, it's also your fault for pulling to many. I'm a 35 resto druid subbing to tank, a role I haven't played in 10 years. For the love of god please let me set a pace I'm comfortable with.
---
Think I have enough for about 3 epic mounts. Although being level 120 would mean I could farm raids and gear up people I like with no effort. Already got all factions and enchants/tailoring recipes I'll undercut everyone!
---
The rogue can protect the priest. But you're not supposed to win against overwhelming numbers.
---
Level a warrior as arms, once you enter a dungeon equip a shield. No you needn't spec prot while leveling.
---
Exact same, I got to around lvl 30 on PVP, hated it. Never any fair fights or mass battles...just ganking
---
The druid is salty literally because winning would have saved him spending the gold for his BiS which is by defintion greed.
---
Ah yes! The speedy druid! Can cast from afar, can melee up close... really good in wpvp, slippery in BGs, relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to gear... multiple sets, too! Hmm... interesting.
---
Spec balance is garbage in vanilla but that's just how it is. It could be mitigated by set bonuses in Classic+ content , or by just releasing Classic Burning Crusade.
---
r u srsly minmaxing lvl 20 paladin?
---
I think is a great idea if they are able to listen to the players complaints about the effects on the Nerfs/Buffs on different aspects of the game and change them if needed.
---
I believe that if want longevity in this game we should not have specs that are obsolete or not useable. Everything should have a degree of viability, p.e fire mages, balance druids or even tank paladins.
---
The item upgrade suggestions are sometimes wrong at 60
---
Between intimidating shout, psychic scream and blind, you should be able to coordinate some element of control and just burst somebody down before their party can react.
---
Any idea why the servers economy is in a terrible state?
---
Gnomes.
---
Escape artist, bonus to engi skill and bonus to int.
---
Other than that alliance warlocks and shadowpriests are subpar, because Will of the Forsaken and like 40% of horde players play Undead.
---
Personally, I'm building rest EXP and do some quests to burn it down 3-5 days later.  It's what's made it easier for me to level.  Busy personal life between full time job that sends me all over the globe, 4 kids (one a new born) wife, etc.  
---
I do, however, find if I want to have some quick fun without the grind feeling, Retail is really fun.  It just gets boring after a bit because you can mow down things so quickly.
---
Stop trolling you trolly troll!
---
See classic WoW sometimes you need to read the quest text. The number of times I've just assumed I know what I'm doing, then realised I'm the wrong side of a zone for a quest is embarrassing!
---
That is quite funny though. Can only imagine those players being like "the heck? Try steal my mob then invite to group???"
---
Which is pocket change on retail.
---
It's Diamond the cheeky bastard
---
Yes. Of course you'll have to deal with training pets, feeding them and stocking up on arrows. But that sounds pretty Runescape-y to me. Also get a shot timer addon, if you go for hunter.
---
They have logs and systems to free move around the world (in real time). I‚Äôm pretty sure they don‚Äôt have a record system more than just data and logs.
---
I'm lucky and managed to get a few nice recipes from random drops in the world. Deviate Delight being a fun one that always makes money, Swiftness Potions usually bring in a decent amount too.   
---
Be sure to always fish for more oily blackmouths
---
Wrong
---
Yay I can lose my name and join loads of random new players I've never seen. That sounds great!
---
Found 1 on the auction house: Willow Bracers of Holy Wrath -  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Willow\_Bracers](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Willow_Bracers)
---
It's troubling as it won't be rare in p2 when Kazzak and Azuregos arrives as well as it's likely that huge battles might take place just to farm honor.
---
The only thing getting crushed is me, between those thighs
---
Whats the addon you're using for the timers? Like the Sap/Blind/Sprint?
---
Didnt even know those existed... That's awesome!
---
They aren't top tier, but worse than Paladins? Come on.
---
They are just entirely dependent on their weapons, that's all. A Rogue with sword of omen at level 33 (earliest you can pick up the SM quest) is like a mini-whirlwind axe.
---
I'd say Rogues are comfortably in the middle, better than Warriors, Shamans or Paladins, but not as good as Hunters, Warlocks or Druids.
---
You've got to get the good weapons from the dungeons, if being fast is your priority, you can't skip them. Fortunately most of the best ones are from quests.
---
I've levelled Rogue, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, Druid, Warrior, Shaman all in Vanilla or TBC and I'd say the Priest was probably the closest it was in terms of speed (although I'd give Priests a tiny edge, but they had slack levels too when you're waiting on a new rank of Mind Blast), provided that I kept on top of my weapons as discussed.
---
Pretty sure it was Diamond, She seems dead on the scene.
---
Yea I get that and it‚Äôs why so many are rolling need on all boe items. There are still some holdouts who try to use the system as intended
---
Discussion is key (as you say )
---
Damn right mograine delivers!
---
Nice meme
---
Most GM‚Äôs today is just standard customer support sadly. Back in the days they were ingame but that‚Äôs very rare today.
---
This so much this
---
How's that relevant though?
---
Roko's basilisk of WoW. I'm in hell!
---
so i got to level 23 as a warrior, and i have mining/blacksmithing. my question is: which blacksmithing specialization should i go for? 
---
i was thinking swordsmith because enchanted 2H swords are my favorite looks wise but i think axesmithing or armorsmithing would make me some gold if i can get the plans. so i‚Äôm struggling to make a choice considering the choice cannot be reversed
---
This side menu wasn't in vanilla was it? i don't recall ever seeing it before (quit retail at Cata, but basically stopped regularly playing when BC released)
---
I mostly OT Ubrs, but after Rend i usually do the initial pull as chain lightning gets a hell of a lot more initial threat, and with a few seconds for them to hit me with lightning shield, i have plenty of initial threat on all the others not hit by chain and usually 2 max earth shocks off on 2 of them and plenty of melee rockbiter hits on a 3rd. 
---
My warrior MT still likes to taunt them off me though, think he's jealous.
---
Leveling doenst necesarely mean he will be doing dungeons all time, rogues have really single target dps and decent cleave once you get far enough in combat , plus no need to worry about mana, also blind, sap,vanish etc and stealth to get through packs of mobs.Paladins are really much slower killing mobs and priest arent not that fast unless they are shadow, and warrior is by far the slowest least forgiving class to level from my point of view plus no hard cc and escapetools.
---
I'm a little curious too. I mean, obviously level 60 requires more XP then level 2. You also get WAY more experience from mobs and quests. I thought 40 was a good halfway point, time played wise.
---
&gt; No idea how people are confusing this.
---
Then why act like you don't fucking understand?
---
Zero chance that was as any server's mafia. This is the most common rat move possible and people are ready to counter it.
---
The exact reason you stated, cloth and sometimes leather is better itemized
---
Transfers completely ruined a good server. RIP
---
Yeah the phrasing in the quote is not made up at all!
---
Did you play at launch? Even with dynamic spawns and layers it was taking half an hour to tag a single named mob and many areas were so contested as to be near unplayable
---
the problem is not sPeLlClEaVe  
---
the problem is the average wow player is just as bad and dumb as it was in '05
---
Why is this tagged as Humor? It's so wholesome.
---
Good to know! Thanks. I think the active skills are eating into my points as I basically want max + stamina and + armour skills so my pet is as tanky as possible (physical attacks)
---
What is the add on your using to see crit chance?
---
Swipe is pretty darn good for AOE threat gen.  The rule for me as a mage is to wait....  Give the tank time to build threat, then blow them all up.
---
Regardless good write up, I came back during BC and was a bear tank.  I know they made a number of changes, but in later content not being pigeon holed behind 2 prot warrs allowed me to Offtank very effectively.
---
Yea, when I played I was 21, full time job, no girlfriend at the time, and could play for hours without worrying about anything.
---
15 years later, my current job is real demanding, I've got 4 kids, married, house to run and other side things I do.  Love the nostalgia, but I think even if I can't do much in classic, I still like to log in to play how the game was when I didn't have a care in the world.  Was some great years during that point in my life, in and out of the game.
---
I'll still stick around and play retail though, since it's casual friendly.  I've found leveling characters in retail to be really fun.  Endgame, wasn't too impressed with, but the leveling between all the areas was a blast since I quit when TBC came out, came back for a few months, then quit for good.  Got to see WOTLK, Cata, MoP, WoD, Legion then BFA when I leveled up from 70 through all that.  
---
Still have my Benediction in my inventory.  Not sure if any other priests that were from Vanilla still have that item, but I might be one of the few who still has the item.
---
Not saying rogue is easy to level nor hard, just average, you have to understand the class.
---
GOD CROOK WHY U MAKIN US LOOK BAD SMH.
---
On more than one occasion I've had the DPS just run ahead and pull while I (tank) waited for the priest to get his mana back.  It boggles the mind why they think that's a good idea.  But it's their repair bill I suppose.
---
I think these kind of players will get bored and move on when Classic stops being FotM so hopefully by the time I get to the higher level instances they'll be a much smaller proportion of the player base.
---
This... isn't a bad solution at all. I would definitely approve of this change, although in the opposite way.
---
Guard checks if target is within melee, if it's not, he uses a grapple/hook to bring the guy down and smash him to bits.
---
ah cuts
---
Well im reserving because i dont want a random troll to need on my bis items. Like farming ubrs daily 20 Times to get the main hand that has a 3%drop but a random hunter needs it because he can equip it and losing it to him makes me think about my life.Reserving so i dont have to farm 4 more days 024 just to get it dropped again so the same wont happen
---
We need cryptocurrency in wow world!
---
Unless they get lucky on plate modifiers in Sunken Temple, most will be rolling cloth for healing since it's easier to get +healing on.
---
Yes, I feel poor with my 150k that carried over from pandaria
---
incendius bros unite!
---
Can't speak expressly for plate, but at least with Mail the number of items with int/mp5 are not super many, and the itemization is often wonky with some weird Strength thrown onto pieces, you can imagine how attractive that is compared to some Int/mp5/SpP cloth gear with spell crit thrown in here and there. Many pre-raid BiS items for any healer are still cloth.
---
Paladin healers mostly want intellect and +healing. So if a cloth item provides more of those stats than a plate/mail/leather item it will be better.
---
that looks like a poor epic to me, my SM dagger does better xD
---
Extended Character Stats
---
Alot more cloth peices gives +spellpower/healing. Just easier for the pala bealers to stack up really high +healing wearing the cloth cos of it.
---
That's correct. It's even possible to have negative points after taming if the pet comes with special abilities.
---
An adjustment to classes so they are more balanced.
---
Currently a good half of the speccs is useless, and on a long term certain DPS classes like shadow priest, feral druid or retribution paladin will be completely out of the question, because their damage does not scale well with gear.
---
I think any of the hybrids really.  I'm personally biased towards shaman, since it's been my main even since vanilla.  You could kind of take it to a whole new level with shaman though, because some people have even went as far as tanking raid bosses on it, which requires an obscene amount of gear, talent, and knowledge.
---
Of course, you could pull off any of the 3 roles on druid as well, arguably easier with the exception of heals (dps might be a wash).  I honestly can't speak as well on paladin; I eventually did roll one, but only used it as a healer.
---
"United States". Poor Canadiens, are they supposed to play on EU realms? :
---
Ag ee oo p.
---
Doesn't that translate into something?
---
It just sounds weird, there are paladins, so why no healing plates then? Doesnt make sense lol
---
Actually a pretty sick item for PVP.
---
Enjoying classic but I done bc in top 150 guild and remember it well, not sure I want to do it again
---
Thank you! I uploaded a screen shot:

---
you can 30-40 in SM easily so there is that too
---
I heal a horrible group last night lol 
---
War tank with no shield was probably really a dps ,   Did large pulled , couldn‚Äôt hold Threat so I had to heal him , the rogue and the hunter and the mage. 
---
We still manage the finish the dungeon twice but it was just because 1) I was on point with the healing 2) we were over lvl 
---
 
---
I honestly believe the tank make the difference if the group is good or horrible.
---
I had 40g when I hit 40. By the time I was 42.5 I had enough. Quest rewards and grey/green drops sell for way more in the 40s. I didn‚Äôt mind waiting a day and a half.
---
When does phase 2 come out? I wanna be 60, and I‚Äôm 52, will I be 60 before p2?
---
Since it's on a PvP server it's to be expected really.  
---
The hunter could've also played around it by trapping and looting inside the devilsaur before trying to loot &amp; skin.
---
with sp gear that proc would do a looot of dmg, probably like 5-600 total
---
You can fix some classes with minor adjustments. Take the tank Paladin for example: his tank abilities procc of receiving critical hits, which is the last thing you want to happen as a tank. So the simple change would be to have them procc of normal hits with a reduced chance.
---
Switch? How?
---
no but playing a human male, backpedalling and using default MSBT font does.
---
1,000 gold?
---
Everytime I have **1** gold my trainer gets all of it... I must be in some sort of mafia or something...
---
Also you should take the group benefit talents like health stone and imp. And yeah, destro is probably best if you're ALWAYS grouped.
---
Atleast you can trust a Tauren. Not like those disgusting Hums
---
I uploaded a screen shot:
---
There are plate gear that have int and + healing but why stop plate when we can wear any armor?  The armor value only matters if you are tanking. If a cloth item has int, its better healer gear than a plate item with less int + str.  Wearing cloth doesnt matter for us if we are the healers.
---
Another disappointed vending machine, love it
---
Shadowmeld is one of the most underrated racials on a PVP server, IMO.
---
Also don't forget you can start eating/drinking and then shadowmeld.
---
Did you panic while dying and press a hotkey to turn off some sort of nameplates? I'd check your ui settings
---
There are plate healing items, but if they're not better than a cloth (or mail/leather) armor piece there is no reason for a paladin to wear them. Healers shouldnt be getting hit, so armor is usually irrelevant.
---
Were going to havt to grow a thick hide and accept that some things are better left alone
---
Do people really care what other people spec into while levelling?
---
Fucking hell that makes me so angry
---
What robe is it?
---
Ngl that is pretty creative
---
Mate, at least the ‚Äûquotes‚Äú are entirely made up. Nobody talks like that. Nobody even types long sentences like that.
---
yeah 5% chance for double hit vs 5% extra crit makes human better i believe
---
Good idea but Bad example bro, nails and screws are extremely different , not slightly. 
---
Nails provide flexibility to structures, meaning under pressure things made with nails can bend, while things made with screws dont bend, they break. 
---
Not a slight change like warr/druid tanking :P
---
Blizzard was bad at itemization.
---
I‚Äôll check it when I get home!
---
Is there actually a reason to find Rexxar for the horde or is he just there to scare the shit out of Alliance?
---
So blizz just didnt feel the need to include plates with those stats? Poor pallies :/
---
Because blizzard had no idea how to do items back then. Why do you think spirit is so common on nearly all the gear.
---
Most plate items are tank/dps. It wasn‚Äôt until AQ and Naxx they had some idea of how to do gear.
---
Wait, we get warnings for ganking? Really? (I am out of contexts)
---
7 days with full time job and i'm running 1 hour every day
---
You need 3 more horde high fiving on slamming natty lights complementing each other on their skills. 
---
Is joke. Sweet job
---
They had plans for everything
---
What is the minimum level someone who is not lvl 60 can be without suffering XP penalty for being in a party with someone who is lvl 60? Trying to help guildies level.
---
Yeah its lame as hell.
---
The second I see anyone doing this I know I don't want to group with them ever.
---
Join a guild and do guild runs if you are like this.
---
I resubbed for another month. It took all of 15 minutes hesitation thinking "I'll play Celeste and Smashbros instead". I do think I'll take a break after this month though. See if I can get 60, return when my buddy is 60 and PvP is out.
---
I agree with everything that you said but ‚Äûbest single target threat by a big margin‚Äú is misleading at best and contradicts many of the cons you give.
---
They are very viable but I really would not try to make that point with warriors being able to use very offensive gear and cooldowns to outscale druid dps beyonf their bis choices.
---
Yes, the warrior takes more damage. But I would not expect a druid to out-tps a warrior that goes full ape. But we are finding these things out as we speak and crowd pummelers are certainly interesting and none of that contradicts your main points.
---
Your name archonn?
---
According to the post you're replying to the hunter never died.  Although that's a bit confusing, because if the mage could solo the pet, they'd easily be able to finish the hunter afterwards.
---
Literally worth 5silvrr per stack on netherwind
---
Idk, for me a holy knight should have heavy shiney armour, maybe an AoE heal and a battle res. A sort of Frontline heavy support if you will
---
Maybe he is a support.
---
Cadaverous.
---
Is anyone else having issues with Battle.net and the client? I have been unable to connect to any Blizzard services on the Americas servers for about 15 hours now. I've tweeted at BlizzardCS and they have yet to reply to me but their replies to everyone else are the typical "We are working on it thank you for being patient."
---
Can a GM or Customer service rep shed some light on what's going on?
---
Someone find this man the video of the sulfuras moonkin
---
People will be rerolling Paladin in p2 you say?
---
We are identical and also a rogue
---
You can check Atlas Loot (addon) for what you can craft with the specializations. But the bad news is: both are equally useless if you plan to raid, because then you get much better gear for free.
---
What server and can you pm me the harrassers name for my blacklist?
---
Disc over shadow?
---
Thanks for the numbers. Not bad. Makes it more tricky for sure to decide.
---
Just make gnome with angry face and those evil mustaches and you are good to go with all of the worlds anger
---
Skullfuckable
---
Yes extremely underrated. I had my doubts at first but glad I gave it a chance because now I couldn't really see myself existing without it as a warrior on a pvp server lol.
---
Another thing I observed is that for example, when you clear out mobs and one just happens to respawn next to you, if you Shadowmeld right away you won't draw aggro. Very nice to avoid death in situations when you just finished  fight on low hp and need to eat/drink.
---
Makes me feel good having just bought my 40 mount and I have almost 50G to spare!
---
Beastial Wrath, Intimidation when you're casting a pesky spell, and drain your mana with my sting. If done right they'll get 3-4 spells off but nothing too bad, especially if you can out range them for a second. Hunters can keep up the rotation after running away then back into range.
---
Meanwhile there's me waiting for the PC release :(
---
Preach Brother!  It took me a little while when I started playing to realise what the LFG Spellcleave spam was about.  Then it dawned that they mean AOE farming.
---
Although I just sniggered at the crazy kids and their new words for old things. Then went about my day making a mental note to never join one of those groups as they sound dull as fuck.  It does piss me off when people try to treat normal instance runs that way though.  But at least as the tank I can just let them repeatedly die until they either learn to control themselves or leave in a strop.  Oh no, however will we replace a DPS class.....
---
People thought BFA rotations were bad but then went to classic üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's an easy way to describe group composition/tactic you are going for (same way people describe arena comps with names like beastcleave, shadowplay, etc).
---
Look at common multi-target melee abilities - blade flurry, whirlwind, cleave, swipe, sweeping strikes = all of these have limited number of additional targets being hit, hence, the name "cleave". Casters just have less restrictions on additional targets, but even if you had 3 shadowpriests dotting everything - people would call this spell-cleave.
---
I usually just mark skull and completely ignore it, let dps handle it while u build threat on the rest. But that requires them to focus skull though
---
Since everyone just keeps attacking you for making a mistake I would suggest trying to speak to a GM and explain your situation and if they are understanding they will likely unban you once they see it was an accident since the ban would have been an automatic response to the spam, I did something similar on retail and I got unbanned.
---
off hand is for buff items like +50 armor
---
You smell like one of us, thats why we help. Come to our side!
---
Grats you now have a nice upgrade for healing :)
---
Thank you! This seems to be exactly what I was looking for, and even more, since I am able to save my current progress. Cheers!
---
And then if the hunter is smart they fear beast you, assuming cat or bear.  Not sure how many hunters realize that though.
---
I'm going to paste another reply that I already did to the whole 'release more servers that are smaller' argument
---
That's a worse solution in my opinion.  More smaller servers means more division in population - more queue times due to smaller servers - smaller overall population than doing layering for a phase then dropping said layering.  You're talking about ruining the future health of the realms in addition to ruining current health of LFG channel and auction house economy in favor of making the first phase 'better' for everyone.

---
Definitely Feral Druid. Paladins are hybrids on paper, but they lack the DPS and tanking abilities and especially have to respec every time they want to change, while Feral Druids perform well in all 3 parts without respeccing.
---
True, i think the way pallies heal are like a variation of a priest healer, just not as good.
---
 Indeed they should have been built to be more involved in the batte.
---
a ranged tank, yeah got ya.
---
I wouldn't have kicked you, but you sir are 100% ass backwards about moonkin. It's not a good range dps in PvE for the same reason enhance shamans aren't. It's not that you put up bad DMG; it's that you have literally 0 sustain. Meaning you go OOM very quickly. This is why moonkin aka boomkin is so good in PvP. You try to entangle enemies so you can blow your mana load with about 10 seconds of stupid DMG. Balance druids are not melee DPS, your a caster hence why you have a talent that procs entangling roots when you get melee hit....so you can run away and begin more casts.
---
Pretty much everything is viable in this game until Naxx comes around.
---
Looked it up out of curiosity. Learned something new today. Corpse camping and ganking players well below your level is harassment:
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184
---
Except for Tauren Shamans
---
Nah, it's his own fault for rolling Horde :D
---
He punished him for his foolish treachery. A bit soft for a punishment if you ask me.
---
This is how I imagined my server to look like but it's actually just 10 people in IF because of layering so its depressing af.
---
You'd have to confirm this on your own realm though, your situation might be different. Economy is wonky.
---
If the leather price stays high, you could potentially be cracking open a brew, putting on your favorite playlist or audiobook and grinding beasts for 1-2 hours a night when you're burned out from questing or doing the same dungeon over and over. Can be pretty therapeutic, at least if you find a place not too crowded (or with one non-skinner running around killing stuff)!
---
I mean, you gotta do what you gotta do as a warrior, because you're gonna lose any normal 1 v 1.
---
what a nice friend you are
---
I believe it stems from Arena team compositions but I may be wrong.
---
Keep in mind phase 2 does not contain a raid so MC would still be relevant. I think the bigger concern is letting people get to 60 before the honor system intensifies world-pvp.
---
Little story: 1 or 2 weeks ago I was in a pug where I'm tanking with a realy nice rogue (we chated and all that nice stuff), suddenly a good 1h sword (which would be realy good for me) droped and he needed on it, so I passed cause hell I could tank this with my pickaxe.
---
So, next you‚Äôll argue that priests should also melee because they have a 1400 armor bonus when using rank 6 inner fire right?
---
i was 2nd place under a rogue. they party leader was dps role and under the healer tho.
---
You don't have an aura on?
---
I mean even if someone got everything attainable in P1 and got bored, why the hell would he go back to a hamster wheel?
---
This weapon is absolute pish, I'm mage.
---
Wondering same...
---
This is NOT a vanilla thing and ruins the spirit of the game. There are so many unfortunate dramas involving reserved gear it gets old quickly.
---
If everyone would just refuse to group with players that reserve gear this would go away. Sadly, the community is not of that mindset.
---
Well just look at the DPS charts of Naxx: Mages 1200 dps, Warrior/Rogue 1100 dps, Hunter 800 dps, Retribution/Feral 600 dps, Shadow 500 dps.
---
If I compare that to the amount of shadow priests, feral druids and retribution paladins we have right now a lot of people will be disappointed by their class soon.
---
You have to kill 30 skeletons in Desolace then the next step takes you to Southdhorr
---
The thots are going to make it annoying, just like they did to twitch.
---
You need to do the quest 'Down the Scarlet Path' in Desolace first. The quest giver is in the inn at Nijel's Point.
---
I ran with a dick spec mage the other night. Dude was OP as hell.
---
found payo
---
wrath
---
So next you‚Äôll argue that priests should melee also due to Rank 6 Inner Fire granting 1400 armor right?
---
That email is so badly written.
---
https://youtu.be/esSX8zPhXSY
---
Mostly relevant.
---
Some players use it for world pvp or like to gold farm.
---
The way he switches from raging demon to a nice well mannered person and then goes back to demon again is so funny omg.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs simply not trusting who you are with
---
Which is why, in pugs boe = need. Avoid the issues before they happen. If you win it and someone else can equip it, you can still give it to them out of goodness of your heart.

Yeah I mean, the whole point of the pet is that the hunter wants you to attack it.  They're emulating threat with stupidity.
---
I don‚Äôt know the answer to this question, BUT I know that what i used to do with with kill/gather quests is I would tag em with some kind of damage and then my high lvl friend would drop em. This was 14 years ago though and I can‚Äôt remember if there is an XP penalty
---
\+20 int to all party members.
---
Sure may be a lot of other better staves, but just having one of those in a raid can be useful at the best of times.

One never go Desolace!

Alliance scum have to learn their place in the food chain...below the murlocs.

He/she enjoys doing it and the point of playing games is to enjoy yourself.

You could probably accomplish that with just a macro and message() function but if you wanted to get fancier for sure, make an addon!

Sure thing man whatever you say
---
I am a lvl51 human priest, as I am in the final stage of leveling, where I can now actually acquire some pre-raid bis items, as well as finishing skilling my profs, maybe get some reputations, I would like to ask, where should I go, what should I grind (for healer pre-raid bis items mainly), what quest chains should I do? I'm not in a hurry to get to level60 btw.
---
They tried other weirder shit trust me.
---
Can you explain me when to use/spam demo shout and when you should do something else (tab sunder)? I hear conflicting things everywhere. Right now I use demo shout a lot when there are 5/6+ mobs.
---
LBRS - Blackcrow
---
BRD - Savage glad

Live strat - Orbs

Warriors are putting res on these items and doing modified runs (i.e. arena -&gt;angerforge -&gt;golem)

I encourage jolly cooperation where I'm able.  
---
Was questing peacefully with someone and an opposing Horde mage. Some druid and rogue come in to gank him, and eventually a level 60 warrior gets called in who craps on us repeatedly. I beg and plead as a level 30 to be left alone, and eventually it happens. The rogue gets chased down by the warrior, which I watch because I wasn't going to make a dent, and then the rogue/druid start calling me a pussy in general.  
---
It's like shooting a hole in the bottom of your own boat and then yelling at others for letting you live with your stupid decisions.
---
Yes there is. You need to complete [this questline in Desolace first](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6141/brother-anton).
---
Starts in Stormwind from Brother Crowley in the Cathedral.
---
You have no problem with low population servers but you do have a problem with layering?   The issues that layering bring are INCREDIBLY small compared to the issues of having a low pop server.  
---
Layering solves those issues you're talking about and its TEMPORARY  and we don't have to go through losing our character names due to merging.  You really can't make everyone happy - some people just want to throw a fit over anything.
---
Yes, I've counted them, there are exactly 1000 needles in Thousand Needles.

Love the Carbot vision of rexxar

What, why not? I am a cow of peace, an elemental bovine of compassion

The true holy paladin is rocking a dress with banana shoulders, it is what it is.

Bruh you run a Arena - Anger - Golem run in BRD for at most one hour and you got yourself a decent enough axe to last you till you down Emperor

Yeah, true but why not mages then? They are AOE kings right now

Yeah you make 20g every minute by crafting... tf you talking bout?

Ok thanks. I'll check it and see how much it consumes for me!

Reroll mage. Classic is made for frost mages anyway.
---
Easily but i do it only a few minutes every day
---
Very nice! How did you make the effect for the flames/body?
---
What's the 'we' that is much stupider?
---
Inb4 all the comments about taking a picture instead of a screenshot. It's too late now.
---
This isn't entirely feasible for veterans of vanilla WoW, of which the demographic back then was largely college students and is now in their late 20s/early 30s and likely to have young children. When forced to choose between spending time with your kids and playing a game, I can see how many wouldn't have that 3 hour block of time threshold.
---
Yeah, this boy did have negative points at first when he was still rebellious etc but its into the positives now
---
That's the one, thank you!
---
a few minutes at AH
---
Yes they can, tailoring requires cloth and leather...
---
Sorry, for some reason I read "auro addon". I must've forgotten to put it on, because we wiped before this.
---
Where are you getting 200 ronecloth at lvl 39 hmmmmm?
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Rogues have higher single target dmg I think.
---
Your excuses are a bigger copout: people don't have to cram onto the same damn servers. Spread out. Blizzard can open new, discrete servers. The issue is not too many players, it's not enough servers. Only morons will keep trying to log into consistently full realms: move on. If raiding with your friends is so important, then they can start fresh on a new, low pop server. People get too hung up on particular realms...one aspect of WoW that has never changed.
---
Maybe hes grinding gold in BFA and trading that gold to tokens.
---
Dont skull up more than lvl 1 intercept and mocking blow etc. A lot of skills costing &gt;1g that just gives shit stats and are not worth
---
‚ÄúYes fren I am gnom wizrad.‚Äù 
---
Doggo confirmed?
---
Druid AoE threat is way better than warrior\`s. Still much worse than pala tank, though.
---
I think you will find at one point they could turn into demons.
---
brb, gotta go gesture to the alliance that you're uncontested territory
---
Sure buddy
---
Ice and Brimnstone, was it not?
---
I‚Äôd be fearful that putting them on separate tabs would probably give some executive the ammunition they need to lobby for separating the sub fee for each version of wow.
---
They gotta get with the times man the hunter hate train has left ever since Classic launched, we hate mages now.
---
I‚Äôm level 51 and got like a full level of rested for this weekend. Rested xp feels so damn good.
---
[this is what I Imagine lmao](https://youtu.be/2GF3rWj0A_Y/)
---
The consistent group is key here, you could easily end up looking for people half the time and then it isn't actually all that fast (and people will hate the spam as you look for new party members).
---
I‚Äôm looking for an addon that let me know when can I go to the profession trainer to learn new skills/recipes.
---
Bonus: if the same addon also tells me what will I learn for my class in sucessive levels.
---
Excuse my English.
---
Oh damn, have they? Can you link me please?
---
I have a feeling the warrior was just trolling with regards to the "why don't you have mage abilities stuff". My guess is people probably were happy he wasn't using a shield so he was giving it back.
---
THAT SAID. For 5man, yea no problem with an arms tank. I tanked ZF at around 44 as a holy pally. Our Ret pally tanked it with a 2h. I was in a ZF group yesterday with 3 plate DPS a mage and a stoned priest and we didn't have any problems. YES the warrior can last a bit longer if they're prot and have shield etc. However it's not necessarily necessary. Even in raids on P-servers the tank meta was fury in the top end of guilds because you can generate more threat. 
---
https://youtu.be/u_azvBdVgz0
---
So it can **potentially** be better. This isn't retail where you're kinda locked into the "correct" way of playing. Have fun with wacky shit.
---
being able to reset your threat is pretty neat in most bossfights.
---
but yes you can skip rogues just take 1-3 for quote
---
Most people realise that PvPing for resources isn't worth it on the long run but it only takes one idiot for the area to escalate into a full blown battleground. 
---
I'll be honest though, these can be unexpectedly fun at times and is one of the reasons I opted for a pvp server.
---
SKRRT SKRRT
---
I don't have any priest specific ones, but a lot of people are recommending Weakauras.
---
If it takes 4 wipes and uncoordinated killing it isn't any faster that regular run.
---
This happened to me last night, grouped with a 53 warrior who wanted to dual wield the entire dungeon, couldnt hold threat off anyone, essentially ran most of the dungeon without a tank, and then had the audacity to blame me, a 59 paladin in almost all of my pre bis that it was my fault he died and kicked me from the group. Next time I see a warrior without a shield on when I entire dungeon, I'm leaving immediately
---
I'm talking about people who purely play the game to farm gold, so they wouldn't go and buy something like, say, Aqual Quintessence.
---
It‚Äôs almost impossible to to make a pet run away unless it was newly caught and you kill it. At the max rank happiness it‚Äôd need to downrank so many times before it actually ran.
---
It‚Äôs SUPER annoying for hunters if it‚Äôs wolf though. Meat food is expensive compared to fish and bread.
---
Fake, this is prolly RFC shm my head
---
or don't be a poor and put it up for 24 hours because its a blue and if it sells who cares what the deposit was.
---
Demo shout was bugged and gave A LOT more threat than it was supposed to. Now it\`s fixed and not really a thing anymore.
---
OK ! I am sure there is some communication that could be done. Being on a EU server myself I hav never encountered this problem
---
Swipe hits three targets only and costs a lot of rage. 
---
&gt; you just wont be able to be a main tank in raids
---
Of course you will be able to. It's not optimal for some bosses but can be done.
---
Are you playing on a nintendo64 or something?
---
You know nothing about it? No offense but I hate you.
---
I'm really enjoying the game in and of itself. And there are a lot of things I am forgetting, and a lot of things were changed 6 years after release.
---
but I think everyone here wishes they could start the game without knowing anything about it.
---
Seeing as Runecloth Bags vendor 50s, you've got a great money-making opportunity if they're 15s on your AH
---
Could just wait a few months, work on retail toons in the mean time? Its people's impatience that creates situations like this. People want a classic experience and you're getting it: respawning times for mobs was much closer back then, just like most of the WoW experience in vanilla. It took years (and Cataclysm) to get that balance right.
---
Isn't the bis druid tanl that 2h mass from Gnomeregan ?
---
Hey guys, I¬¥ve got some questions.
---
I¬¥m lock 46 and I really enjoy this class. Want to ask if item¬¥s with + spell power is same as item with + shadow power (for shadow spells ofc)
---
And second thing. I was planing to do mostly quests during my leveling but instead I found myself mostly grouping and doing dungeons. I went deep in afli and took Dark Pact. But it seems that Im lacking in dungeons. Mobs dyeing much faster than my dot¬¥s need to build their damage so I mostly Corruption, Shadowbolt. Do you think that when I respec to this ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35002005002--54500051000001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35002005002--54500051000001) ) that it will be more viable in group and occasional questing?
---
&gt;But if it destroys the fun of other players it should not be allowed.
---
How does that affect you and your enjoyment of the game ? I multibox too, i do my questing, this weekend try to clear WC for the first time. Its literally no different (other than that im maybe less effective) than you seeing 5 other players playing the game.
---
Do you go complaining that doing 5man party is cheating, every time you see ppl playing together ?
---
I was super worried that modern techniques and the BFA mentality would ruin the entire world, but i am positively surprised. It is different feel to real vanilla, but i think it's very good, i've talked to a lot of random people and made tons of random friends in dungeons.

I've taken the competitive road, and rushed 60 and are in full prebis, and above from MC tanking, and so far it feels great.
---
You miss spelled people and put shaman, what are they rolling on that they can't use?
---
I just want the macro lmao.
---
Definitely worth it!
---
DL is out dps‚Äôing wanding fairly early. You get a lot more nightfall procs with DL and corruption up all the time, which increases your dps aswell, but most importantly, if you play it right you won‚Äôt have any downtime drinking and eating.
---
Too poor to buy Windows legit  
---
Spends hundreds on WoW subscriptions
---
What shitty server do you play on? Greed is normal on any boe
---
Rogues can out DPS a fury warrior on a single target. The only thing that gives warriors an edge is things like Cleave and WW which add extra damage onto extra targets. 
---
Warrior's absolutely can kick out sick DPS and most likely will be at the top of the DPS meter. However a lot of these warriors don't care that they are gimping themselves by wearing leather instead of plate. Warriors also don't have anything to mitigate threat, and raid fury DPSers will find themselves pulling aggro unless they have a threat meter. If you wanna top DPS over a rogue you will need to risk pulling aggro which we all know is a bad idea in a raid, as it can wipe your entire raid sometimes. 
---
if you rule rogues out over warriors that just pretty silly imo.
---
Yeah, the queues on whitemane first week were 15 hours, dropped to 4 after they opened new servers, then dropped to about 1-1.5 after they offered server transfers, now they are +/- 30 mins, at least by the time I get home. I used to log in after 8pm and not be able to play because the queue was too damn long and I have to sleep by 11 or I won't get up at 5am for work ;\_;.
---
Armorsmith have one BiS if i remember correctly.
---
I am forsaken!
---
There aren't really enough flairs to fit all topics.
---
I solo'd it yesterday as soon as I got the quest. Maybe it is overtuned on private servers but you can easily  solo it on Classic.
---
Grats on pre Bis boomkin belt!
---
It does not destroy my fun. Not sure if it is allowed to use 3rd party software for that though.

I'm so hype for it.

Buying all skills and leveling professions. Those trainers easily drain all your gold.

Wait there's a discord server for razorgore?
---
Nice, i could afford TWO EPIC MOUNTS!
---
Bears also get more armor and HP, so crushes are only a problem with Enrage bosses.
---
&gt;Druids and hunters are very similiar in that they don't scale well into later content but they are monsters early on.
---
That's bullshit. It's in the late game a druid actually becomes preferable to a warrior whenever it's possible for them to tank due to the immense threat generation.
---
have you been to ony yet? xD
---
Yeah nothing screams fun like trying to finish a quest and getting one shot by 10 fireballs from the same guy.
---
I'd spent 90% of my game time exploiting it for exploration purposes. With some effort you could "aim" it to get where you want. Getting where I'm not  supposed to be is one of my favourite parts of WoW anyway.
---
And layering is absolutely not classic either, and its definitely tainting the experience. Realm merges are just a matter of logistics behind the scenes: layering actually fucks up the experience in-game. Pick your poison.
---
But how bad can you be to let your pet die twice. By the time some1 kills my pet they‚Äôre dead. 
---
If they‚Äôre 20 lvls higher you just run away anyway and resummon somewhere safe
---
EU servers really are hit or miss. 
---
I have alot of eastern europeans on mine. I think they dub their tv-shows in those countries so they never really learn english outside school.
---
This is why you always put things up for 24hrs. There no reason not to. Even though the deposit is bigger you get it all back when it sells, and it doesn't matter what time you post it. The product will almost certainly sell  in that time frame unless its for something very specific or you're charging too much.
---
It‚Äôs a very mediocre way of living.. giving you a couple extra gold you can vendor after every trip. 
---
I still have LW right now as a 60 priest with 300 gold.
---
Doing a trip of devilsaur (I got 7) was actually the best gp/hr I‚Äôve made so far, there are fire elementals there too witch are a good change of pace rather then running around on your mount the whole time. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm on one of the lowest pop servers in the US AND I play in the middle of the night till morning so no one is on. 
---
Once I get a good stack of cash I‚Äôll waste it on engineerings and the rest of Mars for tailoring.
---
You fight the good fight my friend.
---
You must use new line twice
---
there's no 24h in classic
---
I beg to differ
---
Would love to have that macro
---
I'm not entirely sure if you're being serious or not. This is a scene from an episode of its always sunny in philadelphia lol.
---
All of these spellcleave posts have made me not really want to level my mage. I'm a bit of an altaholic anyway, and have been leveling 3 other toons as well, but my mage is my highest at 31 and who I had originally intended to get to 60 first. 
---
Call me crazy but I'm a mage who doesn't particularly like AoEing. Sure, if we pull a big group go for it, but I'd rather mind my sheep and single target. So far I've not encountered any AoE happy groups, likely because of the low level, but all of these stories make me anxious to level for fear of the expectation of AoEing everything because I'm a mage, especially as I get close to SM level.
---
So this is my first time playing WoW. Picked a warlock and absolutely loved it up to level 43... when I found out a solid group of coworkers were playing on another server. After some back and forth, they convinced me to reroll.
---
Tried Druid, shaman, warrior.... it all paled in comparison. Way too much drinking/eating, not as self-sufficient, not as many ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù buttons (warlocks have like 4 or 5 depending on spec).
---
So here I am playing yet another warlock. I **highly** recommend it if you‚Äôre the type of player who hates downtime. Warlocks who use their health as a resource effectively can go almost nonstop. Once you can start tapping into your pet‚Äôs mana pool, it‚Äôs almost too easy!
---
Oh, and a free mount!
---
"I'm going to reach lvl 60 wether i enjoy it or not"
---
Hahahaha wtf mate
---
And allow all the glitches and exploits that come with layering? You're  being ridiculous: merging low pop realms is far more logical and rational.
---
Bro wtf. Looking at your photo is like looking back at my troll warrior back in vanilla wow. I was farming sulthraze too and coincidentally got it at lv55. And my guild name was Carnage too. Heck.
---
Let people discuss what they want, please.
---
Perhaps try finding groups or ask in guild to spam dungeon runs until you get past some really bad questing areas.
---
Otherwise, try going to bed at 8pm and wake up 2-3am and there should be a lot less people online.
---
Something else? People seeem to forget plenty of MMOs thrived without layers. Layers and instancing suck tbh
---
You will melt faces as shadow priest in pvp
---
It's cool, it's an easy assumption tbf! I'd recommend using an... Aura... To remind yourself to... Use an aura? Heh.
---
Had the same thing happen to me, but the other way around. Blew horn, mob came, started killing him, then a guy came and started repeatedly inviting me. I declined each time because he can summon his own mob and I don't need to cut my xp in half.
---
I killed the mob and started to /w him how to do it. He then /spit on me and left so I immediately deleted the text log.
---
Westfall gets a bad rep for 2 main reasons:
---
1. You get into the zone way too early. If you clear all of Elwynn Forest you are maybe level 11 when you enter Westfall. That is, in my opinion, too low for some of the quests.
---
2. All of the early quests rely on low droprates from very spread-out mobs, which not only takes a lot of walking but also makes your bags fill up quickly even if you have 4 extra 6-slot bags.
---
Maybe , but the scenery looked a bit the same, maybe I will find and send it to you.
---
As a druid (granted im a cat druid but I switch forms to help heal or tank if needed) this message is a nice motivator. I try to work hard at pulling my weight and often worry that I'll just be an unpopular pick for content because im a druid- so not the "best" at anything.

https://youtu.be/IDaCrTHClEs
---
Here you go
---
No thanks.  Layering is way better than starting my character over.  That's like chopping my foot off because I stubbed my toe.
---
I've bumped into a few assholes but I've met way more helpful, friendly players than bad ones. 
---
Maybe you've just been unlucky? The time of day that you play significantly affects the type of people you play with too.
---
Yeah bigger health pool, and more damage incoming than a prot warrior. The thing is, healing in vanilla isn‚Äôt a problem of quantity as much as it is a problem of speed. The larger health pool acts as a bigger capacitor, allowing healers largest and most efficient heals time to pop off.

Heya, hunter here  
---
My fd+trap macro doesn't work: I only feign death, and don't trap when i'm in combat. Trap works out of combat though.  
---
here's the macro (trap names are not exact in here because i play in another language, but they aren't the problem,):
---
\\#showtooltip  
---
/petpassive  
---
/petfollow  
---
/cast \[combat\] Feign Death  
---
/cast \[nomod\] Ice trap; \[mod:shift\] Frost trap
---
A must have.
---
No. You probably still want it for improved stealth in catform, though.
---
I was honestly confused when I read it as someone who played hunter in vanilla.  They're suggesting that the pet will run and attack them to break the trap?  Those are actions you use more than anything really, and almost everyone will have them keybound.  Don't even need to make the pet stop, just reinitiate on the target you want.  Although I'll admit I'm a bit rusty on hunter, since I'm only now starting to level it.
---
You doing pvp and killing others is enjoyment for you, is it enjoyment for others for be ganked... Should it be banned?
---
Just because you don't enjoy doesn't mean it should be banned, it all depends on blizzard, and they already deem it not a violation of ToS.
---
Anecdotal: Since hitting level 60 I have barely used skinning. I will drop it for Engineering (already took Skinning + mining) as soon as I have my epic mount. 
---
The problem with skinning is if you wanna make money you need to go grind. You could grind beasts which will give you thick + rugged leather which will net you a pretty penny, but you'll need to commit at least 3+ hours to make any serious gold. 
---
You can also farm Devilsaur but this is hugely competitive and also a lot tougher alone. Even if you can solo the Saur's, chances are a horde / alliance (whatever your opposite faction is) of 2-3 guys farming will just come kill you and camp you to stop you competing with their leather farms.
---
Basically, since hitting 60, I've been running dungeons mainly, and yea there are a few mobs you can skin in dungeons but the majority are always humanoids or undead. This means that I am not getting much use out of skinning at all. If I went to go and grind beasts, this is time I'm not doing dungeons, and not getting any gear upgrades. 
---
So yeah, I would say that Skinning from 1-60 is really good as you will kill loads of beasts on the grind. But unless you are prepared to go out of your way to kill and skin beasts at 60, it isn't very useful.
---
Worth noting that there are A LOT of other skinners too, so AH is quite competitive. I usually have to undercut quite agressively just to make sure the stuff sells, and its not really much better than vendor price, maybe 30% extra after AH cuts.

I ran a mage in classic, not my normal class. I'm sad we seem to be the wanker class. I do my best to stop this trend
---
I did mention GitHub in the article but you are correct I didn't really push for it. That's probably because almost every addon I've seen on the Twitch client links to GitHub sources already. I guess I assumed new devs would just do it too as that is expected these days - maybe not, I think I'll add a sentence to the article.
---
None really. I got all this gold from just doing quests and instances to 60. At the moment in grinding beasts and yetis for skins.

I vendored the one I won after 2 SM Arm runs because I had Bonebiter and thought I wouldn't need Rav

Whoops.

Warrior aoe isn't bad. Sweeping strikes + whirlwind.

And the croc maybe, do people still kill the rock elemental?
---
They need to simply turn it off.
---
It‚Äôs going to make the queues on some servers unbearable, but that‚Äôs exactly what Blizzard said would happen. Let ‚Äònatural selection‚Äô fix the problem. It would be nice if they could queue you based on faction, but that conditional logic doesn‚Äôt always apply, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to half-ass it.
---
This would be a benefit to the low/medium pop realms as people would transfer to them and fill them up.
---
Cliff racers?
---
ferrals and boomies useless in vanilla, i lvled a shadow priest to 60 and got alot of bis gear but its pretty useless in pve content üò© atleast in early stages
---
When everybody plays with 5 accounts they could destroy in-game economy and some people want to be immersed wich doesn't work with 10 taurens in a row. Personally I have no problem with you or any Multiboxer. But I get that some people have a problem with this. But maybe you can enlighten me and OP why multiboxing is fun.
---
Why doesn't everyone go mages? Hot boxing is still playing the game. It takes a lot of time and effort to setup properly.
---
How to know my reputration with Syndicate?
---
I know it's pointless and so on, but nevertheless? Killing them does not show the tab.
---
By your logic lets just throw logic out the window. This is the dumbest thing I've ever read.
---
Just roll on a PvE server. I loved my PvP server back in the day but I don't have time for that shit anymore. PvE servers just fine.
---
On the subject of cool downs. Do salt shakers have a shared cool down? If so should I just have my alts using one too?
---
"Leveling doesn't mean he will be doing dungeons all the time".
---
Have you played classic? People who can dungeon cleave spend 50% of their time in dungeons at least. 
---
You're talking about priests and warriors solo leveling, as if they are forced to do that. The reality is they can spend 28-50 and 53-60 in dungeons if they want to, and it will be faster than they could ever level alone doing quests. Rogues dont have that possibility. 
---
In vanilla and on private servers where dungeons were way harder and gave less xp, warriors were the toughest class to level. But they aren't in classic, and the way I see it you're incapable of presenting an argument that refutes that.
---
You're also talking about priests "unless they are shadow" like wtf is that even supposed to mean? Of course they are shadow. If they're not then they're dungeon cleaving which again means they're going faster than the rogue.
---
\#justroguethings
---
Very nice man. I'm thinking about using that new RAF and getting some going.
---
Imma bout to end this healers whole career
---
I feel like that people listing it on the AH at that price != rugged leather selling for that price
---
People on my server put it on AH at that price too but it doesnt sell. I usually put Rugged leather up for 1g60s per stack and it sells within seconds, probably to the people who list it for 3g and can't sell it.
---
I do understand the class.
---
Yo this is great
---
The item in slot 1 might provide the answer. Those are all bolts of cloth, which you can get from fishing up boxes.
---
and then came the dwarfrogue and beat the troll to death midpull and proceeded to corpse camp him for the next 30 minutes
---
I do 5-man multiboxing. After doing countless L60 in vanilla, multiple private servers etc the leveling isnt the experience im looking for. But im a alt-a-holic. This way i can play in a interesting way (to me), while slowly leveling multiple classes at the same time. Its tinkering with the addons, macros etc that is part of it.
---
Thanks, and that's where I'm headed next, going to take some more learning on my part first.
---
1- sap hunter, blind pet.  
---
2- yes at 60, seen plenty doing just that. dno how well geared they were tho but def not t1.
---
I can't give you what I don't have.
---
and gotta be an orc for that :P
---
Yeah if you don't play the game exactly how they think it should be played they get upset.
---
i am seeing all replies saying its fair, you are right, this is pvp server, etc.
---
Unless i am misreading, but the question asked was "does that make me a bad person?" and not is this allowed? or am i breaking any community rules? or anything like that.
---
and the answer to you question is... yes you are a bad person, a dick and a scumbag at the game. and that is why you are a rogue.
---
I am pretty sure you were not looking for validation from all the people saying no its okay you can do that, but more of you enjoy doing this and wanted to shove it in harder and trigger people :P
---
nothing wrong with being a dick, pretty sure you take pride in your work here :P
---
still kinda feel horrible for the poor hunter but it is how it is. But karma can be a bitch man :D
---
As an MS warrior that tanks quite a bit, it's very group dependent. If you get a mage that instantly starts spaming AE or Nova+CoC for shatter procs, it's going to be damn near impossible to hold aggro on everything. Even if you SS+WW with a 2h.
---
My approach is usually whisper the healer and ask if it's ok to 2h tank. If they'd rather me tank with 1h/shield, I leave it up to them to tell mages not to instantly pull threat. If I'm 2h tanking with an aoe comp, I'm still swapping to defensive stance to taunt so mobs stay grouped together.
---
Granted I'm 60 now, so I really only get to 2h tank BRD runs and parts of strat, but people still seem to have no idea how delicate threat is in classic.
---
Whitemane got some torpedo tits.
---
The second one
---
Just los range them? Simple
---
People have different goals while multiboxing. Some just play casually, leveling, questing, running dungeons, etc. Some focus raiding alone, some PVP, some spend most of their time just fiddling with their setups, some gold farm.
---
The main draw for myself was being self-reliant. I just get to log in and play when ever it works for me. This is beyond great with limited and irregular game time. I'm never waiting for friends or guildies to come online to go do stuff, there are no rage quitters, no loot drama, I don't inconvenience others if I need to go AFK if my kid wakes up,  and so on and so on. I'm sure you can see the appeal.
---
Running a team of characters changes the game greatly as well. You need to console date things to be able to control them semi-efficiently while still maintaining a level of individual control in order to deal with things the game thrown at you. Tanking while making sure your DPS are not standing in a fire and your healer is healing the right character, all the while handling dispells, positioning, individual defensives, etc etc... It's great fun. Additionally just fine tuning and reworking your setup is sort of it's own meta-game that I and many others find tremendously fun. Figuring out how you can best handle different aspects of playing a group of characters is an interesting challenge and there are a vast amount of ways you could choose to do even the seemingly simplest things.
---
For the main part, multiboxers just play like this because we find it fun. The price isn't too bad at all either if you compare it to just about anything else people choose to spend their money on.
---
Don't buy all your abilities. Only buy the ones you will use frequently. Otherwise you will n out have enough money for first mount.
---
Level 40 spells costs around 1.5g each.
---
I didn‚Äôt invent anything, i didn‚Äôt spin some story about your abusive step-daddy.
---
I see a kid who has anger issues and needs help. 
---
I guess im assuming your a not a grown man given your behavior. The rest is readily apparent  and not an assumption.
---
As do I.
---
And you would consider that better for leveling that doing twice the damage?
---
It's a really controversial topic tbh, yes i want to see areas full of ppl it gives me the feel of a true mmo
---
But on the other hand i don't want servers to explode and waiting hours just to login, or to wait 20 mins just to kill a mob.
---
Do i know if i want layering or not? No i do not know.
---
Because every person who says layering is needed because of the population being so high on servers responds with 'Hurdurr just make more servers with low population'.  Which is just a worse solution than layering all together.
---
Focus my pet, you‚Äôre dead before she is. Warriors standing on top of me are the bane of my existence tho lol.
---
Do you guys remember that Classic vs Warlords Video where there was 200 people fighting and then Switch scenes to Garrison facebook? That will happen way less with layering since the purpose of it is to separate people at the same area.
---
Sick üí™
---
Yeah this although unlikely (I hope) is the reason I‚Äôm staying on a one month sub. Although the classic team have done a brilliant job so far I can‚Äôt help but feel the Activision microtransaction beast is looming.
---
They see how successful classic has been... I would be damn surprised if Activision didn‚Äôt find a way to ruin it.
---
Seems to work like a charm! Will certainly share it with the guildies. Thanks!
---
no this is what pvp is all about
---
that battlegrounds bullshit i'd rather call dueling than pvp
---
You are right the shaman will def be dead because of how slow enh is to kill at later levels.
---
Ahh tyvm
---
1) That is simply not true when you factor in clearcasting being more reliable with spammable spells, crits and their spellpower scaling. If you care about mana efficiency you would spam low rank AE into clearcasting proc blizzards.
---
2) A spell dealing 16% more threat is certainly not marginal. That is 16% more damage you can do before pulling aggro.
---
3) I really dont see the problem here. You dont like drinking? And even if you dont, the only reason you have to drink more is because you dealt more damage. It doesnt matter at all if the mage is late to a pull since that just means you can start spamming instantly without worrying about threat. 
---
4) Well, that is only true if you are not using a tank. It doesnt matter how many mobs you pull if you are using a tank.
---
Im trying so hard to save up for my mount at 40, I don‚Äôt even buy all my skills and struggling to get by, azeroths  taxes are too damn high
---
 [What‚Äôs Training](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/whats-training)
---
I think phase 2 gets rid of layering? Make sure you hit 60 before then lol
---
I'm in PVP SUX WHEN IS NAXARAMAS, they are pretty lively and fairly helpfull. (Probebly miswrote the guildname, just look for pvpsux :p)
---
yeah retards will always exist in MMOs, but you really dont need a shield and sword to tank a dungeon while leveling. Considering a warriors cleave can a lot of the times out dps everyone else in a dungeon even as a tank with a 2h, i feel it makes np sense to use a shield unless the healer is really struggling, then i would swap to a shield.
---
&gt;  destroy in-game economy
---
Dude, its not efficient way to play, in any regard. A single AOE mage can grind as efficiently as i can with 5 chars. So if theres 5 different mages, they do a LOT more "destroying economy" than me.
---
I find it fucking funny, when people talk about multiboxing destrying the econony, after layers were abused to hell and back, due blizzards incompetence.
---
Holy shit your Troll looks awesome. I‚Äôve really wanted to make a Troll Warrior, but everyone keeps telling me I should go Orc or nothing
---
&gt; You deal more damage, and by that generate more threat and rage when you DW or 2H tank.
---
Everyone keeps saying this, but isnt there an ability or talent which makes you generate more threat in defensive stance with a shield? 
---
In my experience the 2 hander tanks never hold agro but any tank with a shield can normally hold it no problem.
---

---
That‚Äôs not how I works but you do you. Probably why this question comes up so much.
---
Hey, you didn't came back!
---
70g is fine. Spend an hour or two farming anything (go for beasts if you have Skinning) and you'll have your mount money :)
---
It isn't the ONLY leveling method, but on overcrowded servers like we have now, it is the FASTEST method. How is that so hard to understand?
---
Do you disagree?
---
But hey if you can show me consistent numbers that are just within 10k xp/h of those who are cleaving Cath and ZF while questing on a rogue, I'll gladly admit I was wrong.
---
I dont think thats true for moonkin form because unlike other forms they still use the weapon to attack
---
You can't lose them when trying to fight back. You'd have to do walljumps while the people on the roof are killing you freely.
---
Oh really? that would be really nice i don't mind if they tone it down quite abit im fine with it existing but right now it feels like the server is dead
---
This is what I do if I see everyone need rolling.
---
&gt;Have not seen many allies in Shimmering either - do you have to run there through Barrens/1k?
---
Shimmering flats? Yeah, nearest flight points are gadgetzan and thalanaar. The only alliance who have the thalanaar flight path are the few who do the quest at the bottom of the great lift for RFK- aka very few.
---
&gt;The product will almost certainly sell in that time frame. 
---
That's not true at all... you could put something up and then an hour later have 10 people undercut you. Honestly, if it doesn't sell in 8 hours at peak then it probably wouldn't sell in 24, and you get a chance to reassess the market.
---
Now we see why customer service times are so long

Either I made a post on westfall discord and subreddit but those are both dead. I think he might have to transfer.
---
If your tag is correct and you are a warrior then that's the life you've chosen. You should look forward to repair costs @ 60 after a few wipes in dungeons/raids.
---
If you're fully decked out in epics your repair costs are:
---
Durability points to be repaired * (ilevel - 32.5) * 0.05 silver
---
So if you have the full wrath set which has an item level of 76 and a combined durability of 725 the equation becomes
---
725 * (76 - 32.5) * 0,05 = 1576. That's 15.76G just for your armor. Then you have weapons/shields as well.
---
Yeah im talking about the ones who write ‚Äùno english‚Äù as soon as you say hey guys.

Hotw spec is awesome for PvP.  It‚Äôs geared really weird though.  The majority of your points go into feral, but you spec for int and stamina.
---
Most of your PvP is going to come from shifting forms and doing what is needed for the situation.  About 50% of your damage comes from moonfire and insect swarm.  The fights are slow, but druids can widdle down any class with confidence except shadow priests and warlocks.
---
You fight according to the situation.  Rogues are Druid‚Äôs easiest targets.  Druids want to stay out of cat form pretty much the entire fight.  There‚Äôs nothing in cat form that will give you an edge over a real rogue.  He can do everything you can do and do it better.  Bear form is how you fight rogues for the most part.  Top priority is fairie fire to prevent him from vanishing.  Also rogues don‚Äôt have a ton of armor to begin with and this negates a healthy chunk of what they do have.  The bear‚Äôs armor bonus soaks up most of the rogue‚Äôs tickle damage.  And the Druid has the ability to heal to prolong the fight.
---
Against warriors the Druid should play like a mage.  Kiting the warrior with roots and travel form while keeping dots on.  When the warrior‚Äôs charge is up the Druid needs to pop bear form.  This will negate a good chuck of the warrior‚Äôs attack, but he can do everything a bear can do and do it better.  So, get distance ASAP.  He will likely wreck you if you try to stay and fight in bear form.  Root, kite, dot, heal until dead.
---
With mages I fight in cat form.  Bear form doesn‚Äôt help much because spell damage ignores armor.  But the charge is useful.  Trading spellls at a distance is a guaranteed loss, but you‚Äôll still want to keep your dots up.  What I find that works is going cat form and stacking up bleeds.  Popping out to heal when necessary.  I try to stay in some form as much as possible to prevent poly.  Also swapping forms when ice nova‚Äôd.
---
There is no one rotation fits all.  You have to adapt depending on what you‚Äôre fighting.  If it‚Äôs shadow priest or warlock I just try to avoid them.
---
Yes and that‚Äôs the ethical problem
---
Ah I just misread is all, thought he said classic team &gt; vanilla customer support team lol. But yeah, likely the customer service guys are the same team.
---
Yeah, personally if it was me in the run, I'd try convince everyone to give the item to the druid since it's his BiS and it dropped in the dungeon where everyone is going for gear, so like, makes sense if he needs it to take it, right?
---
Well apparently EVERYONE in the group besides the Tank agreed to all need. Only the tank was crying about it and ofc when he lost got super mad.
---
On pservers it was the normal for everyone to Need on world drops, so I guess that carried over to the classic community
---
&gt; Like even if Blizz just bent to every whim that this playerbase wants, people would still find something to be mad about.
---
Retail basically
---
Any furries out there wanna confirm?
---
If you enable master loot and act as loot master without a prior agreement in place, only takes 1 person to report you and Blizzard will smack you with their ban hammer.
---
The only reason that people allow this in raids is because they agree to it. If you recruit a group under the pretence of it being Group Loot, then switch to Master Loot at the last boss and give your friend the item they want without even considering another, say a random, player, Blizzard are gonna tell you to take a chill break for a few days depending on the severity / egregiousness of it.
---
This happened to me with the warrior quest and Big Will. I had to abandon it and restart the entire sequence because some asshole came strolling in after the crowd does their thing and just takes him from me, gets credit for his warrior quest, and leaves.
---
Yeah tbh it feels dead compared to the 10k+ on pservers. I understand and respect the need for it for now (I think my server has about 50k online at peak times) but I can‚Äôt wait for it to be gone.
---
I've got 26 gold at level 26 just from grinding, you easily get money for mount from grinding if you take mining and skinning while you level
---
On retail I can hop on and be productive, on Classic a lot of times I spend upwards of 20-25 minutes just getting to a destination. It definitely isn't casual friendly.
---
That being said, I was a vanilla player starting mid 2005, back in those days it was casual, at least compared to games like FFXI. 
---
For example in FFXI, you can actually die, lost exp and delevel, 90% of the content takes a group to do, grinding mobs was the only realistic way to level as quests didn't give much exp, and etc.
---
But these days though Classic can't be considered a casual game anymore. On retail I can hop on, quest and knock out a large chunk of a level near 120 in no time and it feels like I did something with my time. Can't do that with Classic when it takes so long.
---
I'm 43 and playing casually compared to a lot of players, only reason I want a level 60 is to experience BC/WotLK again someday, or face the challenges of Classic+ if they go that route.
---
LOL,  Jesus Christ
---
How did retailer economy get so inflated? I stopped playing in Cata and it wasn‚Äôt that bad, on my server at least.
---
I feel bad for you. Make sure to let the realm know..
---
Weird profession gate keeping...
---
Yes, its by far faster than enhance after lyoh get into the 40s. 
---
The rotation for elemental grinding mobs is just lightning bolt. No totems, no shocks (unless you get a clear castcast). Just spam lightning bolt at the mob from range, and then keep spamming lightning bolt as it gets into attack range with you. With your shield and high armor it should do basically no damage by the time you kill it.
---
If you have are killing 3 or more mobs at the same time, then chain lightning and fire nova become worth the mana. Be sure to take imp fire totems and reduced cost of totems in the Resto tree so fire nova becomes essentially another instant aoe shock, of sorts.
---
Most blacksmiths won't craft it for free though. You can ask a lot of money to craft it for others, even with their mats.
---
Same situation but flipped factions on Zandalar Tribe. Alliance only attacks you when you're fighting a mob or they're grouped. When they're alone it's just a /wave
---
Most likely you turned off the nameplate, try ‚Äúctrl‚Äù + ‚Äúv‚Äù
---
I don't know one for professions (I'd love that too!) But for class skills there's What's Training that adds a tab in your skills book showing what you can train now and in the future.
---
It helps when you have  multiple mages AoE farming all of the mobs you need. Also the sheer amount of players in these areas could easily cause lag. Asmon's guildie creating Sulfuron was an extreme example of that. The server started lagging before half of those people showed up. 
---
I don't think removing layering totally is the right move. They should make it so there are only a few layers to help with leveling and stop situations like OP in capital cities.
---
Seems like a pretty bad staff tho?
---
Because level cap raised, cant be making same gold at level 120 as u can at level 60
---
Then what are you talking about exactly? My argument was, rogues are the worst leveling class in classic because of X Y and Z. Speed, options/convenience and difficulty of class mixed together if you will. You disagree.  
---
So what is your counter argument? You say it's not as bad as im suggesting. So who has it worse than rogues in the grand scheme of things?  
---
Name one class.
---
I don't invite people when I am already in a full group waiting to do I out.
---
Really living up to your username here.
---
I would not recommend tanking UBRS or Strat UD until you are at least 59.
---
It's true.
---
A class with a more interactive rotation would be nice
---
I'm a 60 mage btw
---
I have been choosing which class to play, both in my group of friends and as a solo leveller for when they aren't online. Rogue is the class I chose to go solo. I have not got to level 60 yet so I want to make the disclaimer that I can't comment on how rogues are between 50-60 or at end game raid content.  
---
But here's my comments so far and I hope they help. I've broken it down into a few categories like speed/damage/utility as well as a summary of positives and negatives for the TLDR.  
---
**Speed:**  
---
Overall the speed of levelling as a rogue is probably on the slower end of the spectrum. This is largely due to the fact that rogues cannot often comfortably fight large groups of mobs at one time due to lack of aoe, low armor rating and limited defensives. It can also be slower as the main fighting technique of a rogue is to go stealth and fight your enemies by surprise. Using stealth for 1 v1 burst they probably do the most damage in the game along with mages due to their openers like Ambush. You kill 1 enemy fast but have limited opportunity to kill big groups without risking death and the painful run back.
---
One thing I would say is that people really compliment the rogue in that (other than druids) it is the only class that can quest more efficiently by skipping enemies and getting to the elite mob/quest mob/quest item. However, although sometimes it means you can complete "collect item" quests higher level than you anyone that knows Wow Classic knows that a BIG part of the levelling experience is actually grinding/killing mobs for extra experience so to be honest, being a rogue and stealthing past everything can often mean you find yourself under-levelled for the next zone and having to then grind loads of mobs. This feels way more frustrating than if you kill mobs on the way to a quest. 
---
Rogues use Energy and Energy naturally replenishes to full, like mana. Except Energy is also built up while fighting like rage. Because of this, Energy is actually kind of the best of both. You often open up most fights with full or close to full energy, compared to a Warrior that loses rage if they don't fight and often starts encounters with 0 rage.  
---
Compared to mana uses, you never have to drink for mana between fights, which can slow the fluidity of the game quite a lot and unless you are a mage, it can be frustrating if you eventually run out of drink. To avoid running out can take up quite a bit of bag space which is particularly a negative at low levels when you are unlikely to have 5 bags or big bags.  
---
**Damage:**  
---
When playing rogue compared to my other classes, I would say that at early levels (up to 20) I noticed they probably have one of the highest burst/overall damage classes in the game. After this their damage is still very comfortable when fighting mobs at the same level as you (and even 1-2 levels above).
---
Again, having Energy means you are often going into each fight encounter with the energy you need to do good damage with your openers. 
---
Stealthing (if you enjoy it this playstyle) is a really cool aspect of fighting, and can allow you to do alot of damage through your openers like Ambush or backstab.
---
I'm not 100% sure but when it comes to melee classes I know they are up there as one of the best alongside the warrior. This means if you have to pug dungeons or raids, its not unlikely that a group leader would reject you if he is the type of person who cares about picking good classes
---
In PVP, they are probably the strongest 1v1 classes and are notorious for being the probably the most hated class by other players when you kill them before they can even hit you back. If you're into PVP, the rogue is a good choice.
---
**Utility**  
---
Rogue utility/cc is not as strong as in BFA but of course rogues have pretty good utility and cc. Sprint is nice for getting around or escaping from an encounter you don't want to be in.  
---
As mentioned, stealth is great to have.  
---
Things like Sap and Gouge is useful while levelling and in dungeons.  
---
Poisons good for damage but also other poisons for increases casters cast time etc 
---
TLDR;
---
Pros
---
* Good damage at all levels
---
* Not likely to be turned away from group content (dungeons and raids) due to damage and cc
---
* Fairly decent surviability (using cc, escapes, Gouge + bandage, stealth around mobs or the other PVP faction)
---
* Great in PVP 
---
* Quite a high skill-cap which feels enjoyable when you play the class right
---
Cons
---
* Doesn't have any heals in or out of combat (out of combat heals can be kind of redeemed by bandages but also being the undead race which can cannibalise dead bodies to regen health)
---
* Over-stealthing while questing can have its downside as grinding mobs is a big part of getting the exp you need to level up and proceed to the next zone
---
* With limited defensive cooldowns, Rogues are not the best class for fighting multiple enemies at once which can slow down levelling or lead to deaths if you aggro in tight areas
---
* Quite a high skill-cap which feels frustrating when you don't play the class right
---
Lucky man!
---
Every alt will eventually reach the point where OP is at now, a wall of PvP and corpse camping. So then he starts a new one? And the cycle repeats. Logging in to an alt does not help him scale that wall since he gives up after 15 minutes of being camped.
---
Because no rule is being broken.
---
Which part
---
How much is thid at auctions?
---
You are incorrect
---
"Paladin Classic"   
---
uhm... you sure thats the right link?
---
To sell the skins...
---
I do the same in such situation
---
1.12 talents and spell damage affect all raids equally. If you adjust just MC boss values, the difficulty curve would change.
---
You probably mean revenge - it can trigger off block, dodge and parry. You can use it with any weapon, it just activates more often.
---
i have a plain text that says "HUNTER DISABLE THE FUCKING TAUNT ON YOUR PET"
---
mostly because hunters apperently needs to be told several times.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/titan-panel-stancesets/
---
That might work.
---
If not you can just make macros that will do it for you.
---
/cast Battle Stance  
---
/equip 2 Hander
---
Yeah. This didn't happen.
---
So swipe when there's two or more mobs?
---
We think we do but we don't*
---
That was kinda low..
---
If you can build up discipline and use it on other parts in your life it‚Äôs awesome! If you can only build up discipline for wow it‚Äôs maybe not as good! Nvm I‚Äôm rooting for you :)
---
Did you bring a mage, rogue or warrior or so?
---
&gt;5x server population to classic
---
Not sure if it\`s good or bad. There are only so many thorium nodes (at least until Dire Maul thorium runs) 
---
and demand for Arcanite Reapers is much higher.
---
I guess the point is to use this staff to buff your party and then switch to your normal weapon.
---
We're not all like that :/
---
So true, sad, but so true....
---
I thought they where common drops too, I did SM exactly once got the Axe, Pants and Helmet and in Cath I got the Shild. Im a Tank Warrior the Quest in UC gave me a 1H Sword aswell so I was well equipped after just one run!
---
Definitely. Agreed.
---
/y LOUD NOISES!!
---
Sarcasm...
---
Well if he decides to make a new guy on another server look up the guild Synergy on Azuresong, they are a great bunch of people. 
---
They do guildchat quite a bit but use Discord as well. Mainly though they are all mature enough not to give someone with a disability grief.
---
Yeah but I think people who buy into that shite are borderline retarded so.
---
Corpse camping is fun only for so long, thats why i wrote to log on to your Alt for an hour, then when you come back the corpse camper wont be there anymore...
---
Arms tanking is perfectly fine. In fact it's the only way I can generate enough rage and threat to hold aggro against aoe which seems to be the meta. No one has patience for a warrior to sword and board tank. As long as the warrior is only zerking just long enough to ww then it's fine. Also having a macro to throw on your sword and board for heavy hitting pulls is needed. You will also need a competent healer with competent dps to properly do aoe farming in dungeons.
---
the name plate whenever you mouse over any unit, circled in red.
---
People are horrible at time managament, and US (since we're on reddit) work culture promotes long commutes and unpaid overtime consistently.
---
I couldnt live like that, personally, it sounds horrendous. I'm on the same kinda schedule as you but no kid. I've been dealing with some serious personal life shit and tasks that needed doing but even then I have tons of free time. Uni was just sleep -&gt; uni -&gt; work or stress about not working -&gt; sleep. Endless.
---
Is that what you kids call it these days?
---
You mean right above the prerequisite for omen which also clears your rage and energy costs? It‚Äôs meant to be used in conjunction with your feral forms. It‚Äôs literally called NATURAL weapons lol. 
---
Talents aren‚Äôt what they were in retail nor are druids. Droids are meant to utilize a ton of their forms during fights and place talents in all three trees. First tier of resto, up to omen in balance and the rest in feral is a common feral FPS spec.
---
Pre tbc had the tbc talents no? 2.0 that is... 1.12 has most of the classes in working properly and the entry raids had been nerfed, which is the patch I am thinking of.
---
Nonetheless the content is not as hard as people remember, hardware, latency,  general knowledge,  overall player skill , addons... discord is a huge factor not everyone had a microphone back in the day. I could go on forever 
---
Bottomline the game is balanced for a different timeline. But it does not change the fact that I am enjoying the shit out of classic :)
---
Lolcats*
---
Oh great, that's my server too haha. I'll remember his name. 
---
What's your guild name?
---
No, most players choose their servers based on pvp or normal.
---
This picture reminds me of –¥—Ä—É–≥
---
Because when you spec your character for builds you aren't putting 100% of your points into 1 tree. Do you honestly believe that everyone else has been, for the past 15 years, and is currently; wrong about what a balance druid is? Do you honestly believe you, one single person is correct, and every single other person; including the millions who have spent years perfecting wow builds, is correct and we are all wrong. Think about that.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
It is not useless, you can still cast it once or twice while looting and sending your pet towards the next mob. Also nice in dungeons if you don‚Äôt want to stress your healer too much. It would absolutely be better if it did scale though.
---
Probably more productive.
---
Ive never even had 100g and im level56. Thanks god for wlfelsteed.
---
What‚Äôs MHW?

Some classic in classic.
---
I played a Resto Shaman for 6 years. Part of the incentive of playing Mage, aside from the awesome toolkit, is the ability to shut my brain off during raids. Healing became a slog and I hated the DPS Shaman specs, so this is my chance to be that guy and coast through the first two raid tiers as a 1-button dps machine. It's a feature.
---
Always click these posts expecting to agree with OP but it‚Äôs a special treat when OP patently FUBAR.
---
That belt is not for healing in any way shape or form, you definitely fucked up by rolling on it, at least without consulting your group first.
---
There are MANY MANY MANY more viable healing belt alternatives, but there are 0 better belts for caster DPS.
---
You rolling on that is like a dps rolling on a +healing stat piece because it has int and spirit on it.
---
You were super duper omega gigs hyper in the wrong here.
---
I have been playing this game since 2005 on some incredibly imbalanced pvp servers and I have only ever heard of anybody being corpse camped by a single person/group for (literally) hours, completely unable to respawn or spirit rez, in a tiny handful of very specific cases. Usually where the person being camped did something to provoke a guild or someone on an alt.
---
This isn't something that happens even semi regularly. You might get killed by one guy 2-3 times as he's in an area questing, or bored. You walk away for 15 minutes to go to the bathroom, get something to eat, or just browse the web. When you get back, they're gone and you can continue whatever you were doing. Some times are worse than others, sure, but that's why there's multiple zones to level in at every level bracket. Nothing is forcing you to stay in that one place to progress your character.
---
If pvp servers were actually this wasteland where nobody was able to level because they're being "camped for hours" everywhere they went, like people keep implying, the servers would be dead. Stop overreacting.
---
You are only eligible for loot from the bosses you haven‚Äôt killed because those are the only ones you kill. You are unable to join a different raid ID and just kill all the bosses again. The only raid you can enter is the specific raid ID you‚Äôre already saved to.
---
Oh I love guessing games!
---
You're going to need about 30-40 of your closest friends to help you complete the quest chain to get the mount. Only a couple of players per realm will get it.

Is Tal**a**dril but he doesn't have a youtube. You can find one of his guides [here](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/). He also appeared in a couple shows of Countdown to Classic. If you wanna youtube content, check SkarmTank, he's also a huge defender of feral tanks.
---
But BoE also have value beyond AH? 
---
If a person needs this item, but at the same time have 1k gold, he wouldn‚Äôt mind the selling price at all, he‚Äôs just focusing on the upgrade. People have different values, so a market value means nothing in this situation. Only the shared values in the given group are to be considered.
---
I loved my warlock for solo farming until i hit 60.
---
Then I respecced away from dark pact to an SM/Ruin After reading all the guides and being recommended
---
Now it feels so slow for solo farm. I kill 1 or 2 mobs and then have no mana and half health left. I have to eat and drink constantly, losing dark pact is massive, life tapping destroys my health.
---
If i agrro 2 mobs i almost am dying, if a third comes it is pretty much game over. At level 59 this would just make me laugh as i would come out of it easily.
---
Anyone else felt the same? Any tips. I respecced again to get full fel concentrate but it is still not great as all my spells use so much mana.
---
No suggestion :)
---
Except they can be crushed and crit and warriors can't.
---
I mean, the bear *is* thicc
---
Any idea what theyre like in pvp? I do like big casts big numbers. Like in my post played destro lock abd in retail i play destro aswell but i hate the alliance races for lock üòÇ
---
Why am I being downvoted? https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-had-us-in-the-first-half
---
Someone actually good at mage in classic? Surprised
---
Shadow damage is additive with spell power.
---
Deep affliction (dark pact and succy/life drain) is great for chainpulling for quests and leveling...but SM/Ruin is where it's at for 5mans, and demonic sac/ruin is arguably the best raid spec.  You're not going to push those kinds of numbers with a deep affliction spec.
---
I'm leveling with ruin/rest in affliction, and you have to life tap/drink a lot more, but the damage is great in 5mans and on elites.
---
The guy follows me around to be a dick, just ignore them.
---
bear has an attack speed of 2.5. Mauling one target after the next means the 3rd target will get hit with a 5 second delay, even longer if you are low level and don't have immediate rage talents yet. Tab target maul is a guarantee to lose threat on most targets at pull.
---
Not ninja'ing, 4/5 agreed on all need rolling, I sympathize with the druid but the group decides and he lost. How he acted after the fact, however, is shameful. Perhaps it happened as he said, but there's no screenshot and no other party members came in defense of the druid. Druids just mad cus he lost and now is acting like an angry toddler, grats to your guildie! Good find! I know a mage that won his Freezing Band in a dungeon, the whole group decided he should have it cus BiS, so not all of em go to free roll.
---
Are we talking dual wielding against a level 63 raid boss here?
---
Come hordeside, where they also ragequit if you're 0,03 seconds too slow with putting Windfury down.
---
Technically they're all honorless for now, so it's OK!

I'm going to equip the Valor set on my rogue. Just give it to me.

you can't?

How can i counter warriors, usually cant catch them in battle stance since they change after charging then they immune to fears. Btw idk shit about warriors.
---
Female druids are 90% of the time irl mothers
---
Anecdotal, but as a 56 bear tank I didnt buy my mount so that I could afford a warden staff. I think the trade off was worth it because either way, groups are always waiting on the slowest person and travel form is close enough.
---
yes
---
And then the pet dies, and leaves the hunter.

By that logic you should also skip on gear so you don't pull aggro. Don't blame the most op buff in the game for your friends lack of ability to wait a second before going all in.

&gt;when crushing blows ignore armour entirely
---
Could you source that? I've never heard that crushing blows ignore armor, nor can I find evidence to support what you're saying when checking it up right now.
---
I was under the impression that it's simply a 50% damage increase, so a hit that would be 3k is 4.5k.
---
I'm on the fence because of this as well.. this seems like a mistake on their part
---
Nah, sPriests are at least somewhat useful since they can heal :p

Yes, it is.

You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù anyone.

On incendius we regularly have problems with guilds camping EVERY zone of a given level range, so no open world leveling isn't at all a complete choice like you somehow think it is.

My point was if you are against merging, then simply keep playing on a dead server or one with queues, problem solved?

One day you'll be older, and you'll realize people don't do things the way you used to.  Takes a while for it to really sink in, but it happens.
---
&gt;when crushing blows ignore armour entirely and is the bane of feral druids.
---
Where do people come up with this crap? Crushing blows are just a 50% increase in physical damage done by the mob. It's absolutely mitigated by armor, and considering druids hit armor cap of 75% physical damage reduction, the crushing blows are not a big deal.
---
Oof, I better go to the bank then

They can pop enrage though :)

Nope. Both rolled. Same happened in a Pug on my Realm. You'll get the Loot &amp; Ninja will get a Time Ban. Report it!

Not really true all. If you have competent and good players they will go for bis simply because it makes their character better. The only resistance you need in the entire phase 1 &amp; 2 is some fire res on your main tank for rag. No other class needs any resistance gear.
---
Please explain how you are absolutely certain of these numbers you are claiming.
---
Very hard to find the runs at those levels tho make it 54,56,59 and I'm more inclined to agree.

---
wow did you just assume their genders?
---
Worked great for me the last two onee
---
I caught someone driving to work today. Then I caught a cold.
---
What's your Server?
---
What are those action bar addons please?
---
i am assuming that you went SM ruin for raid dps?  Because Dark pact is actually ‚Äúfaster‚Äù in dungeons with low gear exactly because it gives you so much free mana.
---
If you still want raid dps, but don‚Äôt want to feel like a turd solo, you could always try out demo sac/ ruin.  You sac for shadow damage in raid situations, but can always sac for mana or hp regen while solo
---
Not having bg/honor in phase 1 is going to hurt retention of your pvp centric players.
---
Raxxar is still alive and well in Retail. I'm sure he's fine.
---
Yeah to be honest, I lean towards the method that happened to your mage. People go for loot, loot drops an they need it, they should get it. But like you said, the majority decide and I dont expect a guildie to greed roll when 4/5 will be needing the item. That would be stupid on his behalf. If all agreed to Greed and just him and the druid needed it would be a different story.
---
It's not that i think no one is playing its the feeling that no one is playing its obvious that there is more people playing then even original classic from numbers and server capacity but when it comes to the world it FEELS like no one is playing.
---
Maybe you're lucky then lol, I had 2.5k queue on golemagg two days ago. Its not a big issue or anything, but queues are still a thing.
---
Honestly Blizzard has decent customer support. I've contacted them about five times over the years and they're fast and efficient.
---
They frequently dont get ret aura because they dont want to group with paladins because that's gear competition ;)
---
While I personally have always tanked with 1h and shield I'm not surprised why someone would just whip out two-hander and basically be just a another dps when I've been in groups where priests multidot enemies and mages precast frostbolts before I can get even one sunder in. Coupled with a fact that in lower level dungeons it doesn't really matter anyway, yeah dungeon will take few minutes more because healer might have to drink but if you're not leveling by dungeon spamming it's not a big deal.
---
Yeah warlocks don‚Äôt really compete well with mages, rogues and warriors in dungeons unless they yolo and pull threat
---
I got improved voidwalker and sacrifice it when they attack. I have yet to die to a rogue.
---
I knew a guy in vanilla that scored this staff and he got poached from his guild into the top progression guild purely for that int buff.
---
That's what I say every time I steal aggro off the tank
---
I doubt it's allowed. Third party software influencing the game.
---
Look, you guys made a mistake. A pretty big one. Alliance players are way nicer and fun AND we have the pally class. The horde live in mud guys and have shamans.
---
No he‚Äôs wrong i was there, everyone was waiting for ally.
---
Ah thanks! I am starting a mage for farming. It's need driving me nuts seeing them run around killing 5x to 10x   more guys than me at a time. I've not idea how things like cloth and leather have any sort of market at all given how these guys should be able to flood the market all the time.
---
If that would bei the case, i would actually like the Horde. Most of the cancerous players and gankers are UD.
---
True, until the Warrior hit the point where they have engineering shield, rag trinket and other thorns effect they can stack together with oil of immolation and Sappers. At which point they surpass the threat generation of even a Paladin. But that costs a lot of gold to pull off though.
---
Well I‚Äôve found my new favourite ganking location...
---
It is. It's against ToS to communicate with the enemy faction with anything beyond emotes and interpretive dance.
---
Get off my lawn... ummm, subreddit... you filthy little whippersnapper!
---
Because autoattacking to glory is too boring to make up for any amount of cool factor
---
Did you just assume pronoun address preference?
---
Yes + shadow and +spell damage does the exact same thing for shadow spells
---
I‚Äôd normally say yes, but you‚Äôve gotta respect the savagery
---
As a hunter that farms devilsaur....ALWAYS flare and ice trap on top of your kill.
---
I have saved so many skins by doing that.
---
While it's against the spirit of the game, it's allowed.  Boo multi-boxers
---
People wanted WoW Classic for a reason.
---
This being one of them.
---
The relevant damage is the psychological damage dealt to the player.
---
I mainly hate that they wont shut the fuck up in LFG.
---
No ones crying cos they are leveling slower, any one can roll a mage if they want, I just want these people to chill out in  /LFG
---
Ah dang, no joke this EXACT thing happened to me.
---
All right
---
Yes.
---
I think most people don't care what they do but there are 2 issues that affect other people who aren't in their spellcleave groups:
---
1) They spam trade chat for their cleave groups
---
2) They go to regular 5-mans and try to AoE and cause wipes
---
There's a lot more players that know how to farm and how to use resources efficiently these days. Farming materials on PvP servers will slow down a bit once the system PvP is introduced in phase 2.
---
Very cool of you
---
I watched a 57 mage today out dps a 60 rogue consistently in a few back to back lbrs.  That's honestly pretty typical too.  Not sure where this rogues are best dps sentiment is coming from, but it's simply not true.  At the gear levels of the average group right now, it really comes down to which dps knows how to properly play their class, except for mages who are always going to be on top.  
---
Don't get me wrong, there's lots of good reasons to take a rogue.  But they're not top dps by a long shot.
---
Phase 2 is supposed to take layering out and when it comes to high pop servers it will be literal hell considering high pop back in the day is our current medium pop servers.
---
Agreed.  I prefer it over LFG any day.  It rewards being calm and having people skills.
---
1.12 talents and all other subtle changes have made pugging MC more accessible. MC has always been pugged to be clear, and things have been reserved, but now we're just seeing more of it.
---
I was in a pug MC where a group of 5 "started it", reserved many things, and weren't even running it... Some other warrior not affiliated with them was running it.
---
Its never been easier to establish a pug and with no real work.
---
If you don't like it just make your own groups.
---
Is that shaman-specific? Judgement/Seal definitely don't delay paladin swings.
---
5 one month subs for me :( I couldn't find it in my heart to drop 400ish
---
i cant heal myself in cat form, so high damage with the ability to use HOTS makes me a lot stronger.
---
In a case of lock vs lock, naturally. But any other class this should work. Now I'm not saying WotF is weak, but it's not as broken and automatic win-button people make it to be, even if you do play alliance warlock.
---
This was happening last night on my server... I needed to go to Org for engineering training and during that time the city was being attacked. When I got to the AH though it was all clear and I was very confused. Around my second on third trip down the layers must have synced because there were a lot of alliance corpses in Org.
---
Very well could be true, honestly have never tested because I‚Äôve never rolled moonkin..... for good reason.
---
The idea of multiboxing fascinates me. The reality and difficulty of setting this up scares me
---
wow dude
---
You also do not need to be fully MC geared to progress in BWL.
---
Re-Roll
---
A little under 3 hours, no real breaks, 1 death - rogue wandered into a group solo.
---
Yup it's kind of a gap thingy. Most people are all about meta strategy. Welp I am just here to enjoy my game at my own pace and learn from the mistakes I make. Most complaining is more about these strategies being forced on people in dungeons, atleast that is the part I am kind of disgruntled about sometimes. 
---
Also this is the internet, there is always gone something that people are complaining about, that is timeless
---
I love memories like this! I remember in Cata when Firelands was out our raiding guild was very... Well, we were casual in the sense that we were WAY late in the xpac to be raiding, but we all took raiding very seriously (we were just way behind everyone else). The whole instance was cake to us, except friggin Ragnaros, who we'd wipe on every week. I remember we legitimately had 5 weeks of 1-shotting every other boss in the raid, then spending the remaining hour of raid day 1 and 2-3 hours on raid day 2 just repeatedly wiping to Rag. We were SO BURNT OUT. On the week we finally downed him, phases 1 and 2 were a cakewalk, but in phase 3 where the boulders start chasing people and you still have to line up correctly for the ads and hammer waves our people just started wiping. It got down to me (mage), an enh shammy and a paladin tank while Rag still had 3% left and we SOMEHOW were able to burn through it. When he died there were literal CHEERS of joy on our Vent server, it was insane. 
---
The next week, over half of our raid team had decided they no longer wanted to raid and I took my first 'break' from WoW hahaha. But the sense of accomplishment after something like that is a high I seriously will never forget.
---
My experience has been that we say the raid will be 3 hours, but spills into 4 and comes close to going over.  That will drop substantially in the very near future, but there still is a progression element, as about half the raid didn't go through the progression the first time around.
---
That's not the problem though.  We spent many many hours getting people through attunements, especially ony being a horde guild.  So before that 4 hour raid today for example, I probably spent another 3 to 4 in and out of ubrs and world spawn dragons waiting for people to travel.
---
Maybe you can play this game casual; that's not for me to say.  You certainly can't be raid ready at this point if you're playing it casually though.  Unless you're in a full guild that already did it on private servers or something.
---
Warlocks don't have a wand specialization talent, and wand DPS drops off harshly in the higher levels without one.
---
It's kinda rare to see "need DPS" for me. But that may be due to perspective(I'm a lock). I mostly see "Need tank." Many times I've seen multiple groups needing a tank at the same time.
---
Something I'm wondering : When you write a ticket, do you have to write it in your server's language (eg English if it's an English server, German if it's german one) or in your client's language ?
---
Every time I see this I send them a stern warning that they're embarrassing the Cenarion Circle and need to reconsider their life choices.
---
Yeah! Don't have a cow, man!
---
Because the community is of the mindset that we can make our own decisions and group with whoever we want however we want.
---
In my experience the etiquette has always been if you need roll a BoE you are expected to equip it to prevent it from being sold.  But I feel like the WoW community has changed significantly since I played.
---
But if that group was a pure pug out of trade chat than your foolish to believe those players have anything but a me first every man for themselves mentality.  
---
The real asshole here is whoever mashed the need button forcing the issue, not the person who won the roll.    Though given how the druid reacted he seems like a piece of shit, so fuck him.
---
And wrong you are. Grinding is all you did in Vanilla/ do in Classic. One big difference is all of the sources of ‚Äúhow to‚Äù videos, guides, website data, and player knowledge that it‚Äôs far easier to lay out a path for that grind in Classic than it was in Vanilla.
---
Whats even the part in arguing if you're going to back your own statement up with a random number from your own leveling experience to 30, christ.
---
Good tanks do
---
It doesnt influence the game in the way you think. The setup isnt run in the game client. Which is why Blizzard isnt going to do anything about it. At least not unless the community demands action.
---
Multiboxing is a way to play the game. I don't agree with it. But, it isnt against the ToS.
---
Is this an RP server?
---
it's not even relevant since apparently he is having language barrier problems
---
11.11.11
---
I mean, I haven't encountered anything in life that counteracts this depiction.
---
Yea it is!
---
Different argument, irrelevant comment.
---
Whats your RAM situation? How much and what type i mean.
---
After I get BiS - I still need that pirate admiral hat, and a frostsaber and ten million other things.
---
Yea i was going to mention that part but I didn't want to point everything out myself haha.
---
4 of the top 10000 guilds...
---
I don't recall any other class being able to pull these spells in the order you described them.
---
How did you die early on then...? There's no mechanics that you can die to in P1 unless you either get tailswiped into whelps or stand with the tanks, and P2 there's nothing but fireballs which you should never die to especially as a healer lmao
---
good shit
---
So that‚Äôs why all of the end game balance druid builds (both PvE and PvP) take ZERO points from the feral tree? But I don‚Äôt understand? Makes sense.
---
Google dive‚Äòs drain tanking guide! It has everything you need.  Once you respec into that build you are going to absolutely shred mobs with almost no downtime... my lock is 55 now and  I fully dot and fear joggle 3-4 at a time.
---
Join gandling I'll help him out on ally
---
Only leaves out 16 lvls
---
For my level 33 priest it's recommending cookie's stirring stick as my wand, when there are multiple easily obtainable wands which are better than it for me right now.
---
There is a problem clogging up LFG chat crying every time someone reserves an item.
---
Our OT bear is already wearing full BIS until p2. Our 2 druid heals are pretty close to full BIS as well. 
---
Now look at our dps warriors and mages... Having 1 epic from MC is a success.
---
We have same amount of taunts and same cd as you, we keep aggro with skills which said "high threat" for example sunder. Literally every sane warrior who is tanking is skilled into dps like you.
---
This is nothing to do with Faction it is simply player mentality. I live in the UK and call it the 'school bus' approach. Some idiot on the bus themselves will sit there with their head down but put them in the place surrounded by piers and they suddenly become 'the big man' trying to impress/show off/feel good.
---
What's the addon for the UI? I want to try it, looks really great.
---
Could be a quest drought in the mid to high 30s
---
apparently im the only one smart enough to figure out how to do high dps as a balance druid because everyone else is just spamming wrath from 30 yards.
---
*cata
---
Vendor low level skins and herbs, don't waste money posting them in the ah.
---
holy shit that staff is RARE AS FUCK
---
That's also how I've been doing it
---
Because it's one of the only medium/low pop servers meaning I don't have to fight over quest mons or resources too often.     I was actually able to quest in STV without getting ganked by 2000 horde every 5 seconds and it's just been a much better expirience overall.  Thank fucking God my guildmates talked me into tansfering.
---
If you want buffs, cleanses, spot heals, and extra Lay on Hands and some well timed BoPs then the answer should be yes.
---
16gb I forgot the exact name but they are ideal , my pc is a beast. Running 2080ti I9 etc..  so shouldn‚Äôt be having a problem.
---
From the understanding I got from my guild mate, the item dropped and the group all agreed to all need, but the Bear Tank protested, obviously.
---
The druid, though, claimed the item dropped and everyone greed rolled and the Warlock (Guildie) needed and took the item. From everything I've seen of this player he doesnt seem like the type to pull that bullshit and was very upset with the accusation
---
What server are you on? I‚Äôm a 300 tailor and probably have some free bag upgrades for you.
---
For a levelling guild just look to your server and the people you play with. Chat to others questing and people in dungeons and ask to join if they seem like good folk. 
---
Searching on Reddit isn't ideal for a low level experience.
---
Well, you can of course keep suggesting that Classic has a lot of endgame content, but that won't make it true.
---
Warrior, but you don't need to be prot for ony/core. In fact the damage reduction actively hamper rage generation. Now I'm not saying don't have any prot talents, just get the main boys and get some good stuff from the rest.
---
Then I do the same thing for my alt!
---
I found it useful. And it seems other people are interested in seeing this info.  It‚Äôs nice to see how much xp is required every 10 levels.
---
If you are on a PvE server you can right click on your name (top left corner of the screen) and flag for PvP. You will be able to attack anyone flagued for PvP but every one (even unflagued) will be able to attack you.
---
If you attack someone flagued but you are not flagued, this will flag you for 5 min. 
---
If you decide to unflag yourself, you will still be flagued for 5 min.
---
If you are on a PvP server then you are always flagued for PvP
---
Now remake this for Mankirk's wife. She is not doing well...
---
Can't you actually get enough dagger skill from items to hit the next breakpoint?
---
I don't think you'd want to but there's an absolute ton of dagger skill availiable from items.
---
That wasn't my whole point, tho.
---
Found sunde.
---
Spell cleave isn't the problem. It's fine. The problem is that people are retarded. You will always deal with retarded people regardless of spell cleave existing. 
---
These posts are ridiculous. If you seriously think spell cleave is the reason people are bad at the game then you aren't using your brain.
---
Darkshore is a shore that is always dark.

The darkest timeline
---
Salty ninja looter spotted.
---
Works like intended is what Blizzard is saying.  
---
they have a reference client, where they compare.  
---
Also P-servers where wrong in that way.  
---
he only way to get this to Blizz attention is to actually make a comparison video with a oldskool video from 15 years ago and a video from now ( so no pserver footage ofc)
---
Why even bother with Classic, if you just wanna get to 60 instantly?
---
nah man, stealing shit from reds is 100% fair game.
---
For pve servers it allows people of the opposite faction to fight, on pvp servers it‚Äôs always on I believe.
---
Classic is back baby!
---
Haven't played in over the decade and bought a 6 month sub the day after it came out.

Lol ok dude.

Takes less than half a second to lift a finger to press shift and press the bind. Get out of here.

i FAP plenty right now tyvm

Well that changes everything, nice!

How do you manage multi target? If i get swarmed my fear gets interupted. Whats the best way if you make a mistake and pull 3-5 mobs to handle it? Only level 10 right now
---
&gt;triple digit IQ
---
&gt;alliance
---
pick one
---
Haha I'm with you on that one
---
Created an alliance character during prime time yesterday. /who class 60 on all the classes and none were at 50. We added up the numbers to around 320 lvl 60s on alliance. Horde side impossible to tell as every class is capped at 50 players. With this queue based system and a 80/20 or 90/10 split queue times would be hours for horde.
---
He truly is Mok Na‚ÄôThal
---
So that‚Äôs why all of the end game balance druid builds (both PvE and PvP) take ZERO points from the feral tree nor take the Natural Weapons talent you‚Äôre referring to? But I don‚Äôt understand? Makes sense.
---
I thought it was a disability that prevents him from typing out his thoughts on chat. I dont know why OP included the disabled part if its irrelevant to the problem.

Very nice. Reminds me of [this shot](https://i1.wp.com/psychodrivein.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Ethan-Turning-Away-from-Society.jpg) from "The Searchers."
---
&gt;Some servers, like Faerlina, will probably never be able to remove layering entirely...
---
I don't feel like this is somethone Blizzard needs to fix. It's a player issue created by players choosing to want to play on the streamer's server.
---
Layering isn't needed. Disable it and Faerlina will have 5 hours queue's if the realm cap is 3k or something.
---
Allow free transfers to a different realm.
---
Then:
---
If you want to play on Faerlina?
---
Wait 5 hours.
---
Don't want to wait 5 hours?
---
Transfer to a server where you don't have to wait 5 hours.
---
This\^
---
As a healer, I'd rather have 4 dps than a tank. You can easily keep people up if you know what you're doing and it's faster. I usually fall asleep if we have a tank.
---
You are 100% right on this.
---
I work around 10 to 12 hours a day and have a 1 hour drive to my office (one way). So I am already between 12 and 14 hours a day occupied just with work. Not including calls with customers in other timezones that can happen very early in the morning or late at night my time. I also go 3 times a week to personal training and 2 days kickboxing. On the weekends I meet friends or spend the night out. And I am very proud of my 6 to 7 hours sleeping cycle, even on the weekends. Means, I don't tend to stay in bed all day even tho I was partying the night before. And that's not even including the time for food prep what is really necessary because of my workout. I just don't have the time to prepare everything I need for food as the day comes up. So I spend 2 hours every 3 days extra on prepping food. (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks in between) I have also a household. I am alone what results in less things to do, but it also mean that I am the one who needs to do all of it. And in between I also want to have some time to relax and doing nothing because that's also important once in a while.
---
So in order to play more games I would either need to get a new 8 to 4 job, spend less time with friends or sacrifice another hobby (sports) to have more time for this hobby. That's a decision everyone needs to make for themselves. I enjoy my time away from PC, that's why I value sports currently more than gaming. This would probably be different if I would not spend over half a day in front of a PC for work already. 
---
I also can't really complain about the stuff I do for fun. My working hours are constraining my time more than all the other things. And only reason why my life works like this in general is because, I have flexible working hours. The guy replying to your post also said "poor time management" what might apply to younger folks in general. At least for some. It certainly did apply on me when I was younger. But what most people are missing is, that someone can be very busy even without family and kids at home. Again, my own decision because I can look for a new job where I work less. Or skip 2 days of workout every week to make room for gaming. But I won't spend less time with friends. There is a 0.00% chance that this will EVER happen.
---
That's pretty much it. I decide what life I am living and gaming has very little room in it right now. I also didn't say "Man I would love to play that game but I can't" because that's not true. I can't play it most of the time because other things are more important for me.
---
At first I thought she meant something entire else with her pointing, smiling, and these motions "down the path to the south".
---
If you are spending a large amount of time open world farming feel free to respec twice a week.
---
I personally do this for farming mara...though when doing ow farming i never felt terrible drinking after 3-4 kills it was annoying but better than 100g in respecs a week if you use mage food
---
He's trained in the arts of cock magic.
---
This is just someone using sprint
---
Eh, there are times where you really are just better off logging off and taking a 20 minute break rather than doing the graveyard run 5 times or getting off a lucky hearth and then traveling for 20 minutes to a new leveling zone.

r/woooosh
---
For multi group pulls on my druid I got like this
---
Start in caster form,
---
Starfire one, 
---
moonfire another the instant starfire finishes, 
---
rejuv self, 
---
go bear, 
---
faerie fire the next target,
---
demo roar once all adds are in range, 
---
bash one if there‚Äôs yet another, 
---
try to swipe as much as I can, (if taking heavy damage opt for frenzied rejuv instead)
---
get faerie fire on everything.
---
Be ready to taunt whatever one gets feisty
---
Additional things; there‚Äôs aoe trinks that can help too, like eraknis gas and fras abis smoker thing. Also Crystal Charge from Un‚ÄôGoro, (you can shape out of bear and throw it down, and get back into bear in an instant).
---
I haven't experienced anyone leaving anything if they are successful in it.
---
ElvUI doesn't (unless it's been updated) show pet happiness. I had to add it to my unitframes manually.
---
Why do you keep making this post?
---
That's fair enough man, this is my first mmo excluding a bit of maplestory. Hit 40 yesterday, having a blast! But each to their own. What server are you on?

Spam lightning bolts, use Ele Mastery and Clearcasting procs on Chain Lightning, shock as needed for effect (shocks are not mana efficient for damage). Keep Flametongue and Lightning shield up and melee down mobs when they have less than a Lightning Bolt's worth of health left. That gives you a few mana ticks and lets you delay drinking by an extra mob or two.
---
Fucking kek
---
Are you me? My main is a feral druid but I love my mage alt.
---
My main is an alliance warlock on Westfall. I'm leveled a good bit past him but I'd be happy to help out sometimes. My play times are irregular and I'm unguilded myself, though, so I can't offer much. Good luck!
---
Holy shit you‚Äôre right, thank you sooo much!
---
Too bad he can‚Äôt hear your train since he‚Äôs not in your party ;)
---
Imagine ruining the reputation of your guild over t2 priest helm LOL
---
Multiboxing has never been a bannable offense by blizzard. I guess it's because of the money they put into the accounts. Although they can be seen as a major advantage over others.
---
Are you implying that she wants to do it like a Druid on the Discovery Channel?
---
Wow, ok. And here I thought a legit reason to hate the Horde is because they're bad guys.  
---
Hating Alliance is one sad thing for you to say, and number 2 is calling players of Alliance's   
---
mothers whores is taking it too far.
---
Westfall is definitely very boring to look at. I generally prefer dark forests like Feralas and Darkshore for aesthetics. Hell even Loch Modan is more interesting to look at than Westfall.
---
What a life ü§§
---
Yup it's starting to happen to me and it kinda sucks. You have to constantly heck yourself.
---
The group just needs to be formed correctly and everyone needs to understand the objective of the run.
---
Ive been doing melee cleave since armory at 36-40 then cath 40-44 now were almost 50 and clearing zf with cleave groups veyy fast.
---
I play warrior and my bro is enh shaman with ravager so I usually look for 2 warriors, hopefully they have rav but I don't mind ultimately and usually a rogue as well and hope he has thrash blade. Priest is best healer but any will do really.
---
I can't speak for spellcleave, I've never played casters but I imagine it can be quite stressful.
---
Can you elaborate? I looked up a quest but it said it was nerfed on wow head
---
Oh it totally could! Every fight is different and DS are no slouches. I was only counterpointing the implication that without light of elune APES has no chance.
---
no this makes u a normal rogue
---
Maraudon offers vastly superior weapons to this one, as does uldaman
---
i would go to the necrosis thread on this I have heard there is a lot of trouble with it and I personally dont use it
---
60. Got a month left. Probably won't resub. Got a good chunk of the "experience" I wanted (waiting for guildies to catch up to raid). Tbh, the actual MMO from a play style standpoint is pretty archaic / low skilled.
---
The best thing about it is that the game doesn't feel like the retail MMO's that this game turned into later, or something like SWTOR did... where just bashing through the game and hitting progression (or PVP) is all you do... with homogenized gearing. 
---
The real MMO needing to be made is a mix of the two that adds more mystique and broader choices. Classic Plus could do something like this and then I'd probably find some interest in the game. Otherwise my journey here was well spent but not worth "living in" for ages and ages as these phases are released artificially to bait sub time.
---
Tbc came out in January 07 right?
---
It's not that they're bad at the game. It's that they're ruining groups for other people and not trying to learn any better. They're copying one fast-leveling trick, trying to take it everywhere, and being mule-headed about it when that trick doesn't work.
---
Anyone spamming these runs is the sort who who'd pay for a L60 boost. Basically, they're skipping half the game.
---
Bro what is the name of this quest log add-on?
---
Sure, but remember alot of pre raid bis is still bis through BWL.. like HoJ.  You're basically saying "why are people so angsty to farm gear they're going to use for a year at least?!?"
---
because he does
---
You mean Thrall or Saurfang? I‚Äôm not really that good at lore
---
do you have to set that up on every startup or is it enough doing it once?
---
This sub's hate for spellcleaves even more ridiculous than hate for streamers prior to the release. 
---
It's not a problem of meta that you meet assholes down the path. 
---
Difference in exp is not that big in a group with any composition compared to 3 mages. Dungeon spam is just good for exp, doesn't matter what class you play.
---
Seriously, why do people roll on PvP servers with this attitude. Did they think you needed to be on a pvp server to join BGs?
---
So far as a true undead rogue i only open on mages that haven‚Äôt spotted me and don‚Äôt have a shield on. If ambush doesn‚Äôt take ~50% of their health i get the fugg outta there as a true slimebag and try later, lvling is fun.
---
They're for folks who actually don't want to play the game.
---
Took me 3 days to kill Bhag'thera. There were groups waiting to spawn tag it everytime I was on
---
Can someone explain how raids work, and at what level I am likely to start being able to do them?  I never stuck with WoW long enough to end up in a Raid.
---
Stuffed crust king kai!
---
I don't think it applies so much to warriors. The only ones I don't like are the arms specs who think they can just toss on a shield and go under geared into dungeons that are too high level for them and everything will be fine.
---
The mage or any aoe group might be fun and all but it puts a lot of extra pressure on tanks and healers. Eventually the mana runs out then they lose control or the mobs and are running around getting pounded and the healer is oom because you got 4 people playing tank in their cloth armor. Most tanks and healers are going to prefer a meticulous approach which emphasizes control instead of the pew pew zerg and gambling with a wipe on every pull.
---
Also, there are idiots in every generation without exception.
---
Warriors are cool. Mages are sissies who attack you from range and blink away if shit hits the fan, so they attract a specific breed of trash players, the ‚Äútryhard pussy‚Äù.
---
But some of them are okay, especially the minority who have enough IQ to buff AI without asking and give out water.
---
I love being a mage. So beautiful.
---
This is why 40 mans were reduced to 25s - one of the reasons anyways 
---
Giving loot to pugs when you are in progression is shitty but you almost always need pugs because 40 people is almost impossible to reliably organize on a regular basis
---
sure thing! even pvp and whatnot is mostly made complex by things like engineering not by the actual class or map design. stuff like seal of command or shatter are the most complicated effects that come into play mechanically, really. sure rogues can do some fancy stuff but the balance is exceptionally poor so anything that would be skillful is outweighed completely by imbalance
---
For those of us who have done MC 4 times already, we're fine with doing it quickly.
---
It's quite viable and you will see a lot of people using it. Full feral or full resto is better at their thing. Hotw spec does both thing quite good.
---
I play on Mirage Raceway.
---
Last time I did my census, Mirage had \~38% horde, while Pyrewood had 35% or less.
---
It isn't so relevant, since we're talking about thousand of players anyway.
---
Cheers,

I think this is a case of not knowing what we don't know.  For example, there's a lot of people speculating that world pvp with no bgs will be really offputting, because people will feel greifed over what used to be called pvp.  Maybe they are correct, and maybe people will be driven to quit.  Or maybe people will realize that that kind of world pvp is really fun.
---
That's just one example.  Another is when layering is gone.  All of a sudden that thing that you wanted to do won't be on demand anymore.  You'll have to wait your turn.  Maybe even get ganked in the process.  So will that frustrate people, or increase the satisfaction when you actually accomplish it?
---
What things am I not thinking about?  I think something we're not thinking about now will pop up to either drastically increase or decrease player interest.  I just don't know what that thing is.
---
Are you saying it's a violation of the rules to PvP on a PvE server? Perhaps we need a read of the ToS, it's something people often ignore when their argument fails.
---
Because the ToS and Blizzard have made it clear, Multibox isn't a violation of the rules.
---
Should they have a Multibox realm? Sure thing but like you can't prevent PvE on a PvP realm and you could limit PvP on a PvE realm, you'll still have multiboxing on both, because the rules would still allow it.
---
I want to make it clear, I don't use multibox, I do however operate a second account of the opposite faction, and no, they will never be interaction between the two.
---
Second time, in chat I heared someone say they do howl and here you guys say they don't. Confused.
---
Jonas?
---
We also value + spell damage or + shadow damage way more though. Witch blade and drakken sphere, both blue items are substantially better warlocks than that staff is. OP just doesnt understand his class‚Äô stat priorities.
---
I just love these threads...both people intentionally misreading each other in the worst possible way and getting in an argument. A mild annoyance transfers into one guy not liking the game and another guy enjoying pain.
---
QuestGuru

Been thru about 4 times, and still haven't completed that many.  Job well done!
---
voidwalker sac, dots, curse of exhaustion, consumes...rogues are ez as hell if you dont get 1 shot
---
But the exact names of every offending member, make sure they can never raid again
---
Brother if you out dpsed people in the group by being a stabby owl they did a favor by kicking you LOL
---
Ur right, I guess. But man, I am a very kind soul. I hook up with sum dirtbag a couple of levels lower than me, we do a quest together, then I help him do some quests that I already did and then they just drop the "thx for group gl m8" bomb right on my oversensitive face. The decent ones move forward real fast while I'm at work and express no interest in backtracking just for the sake of it.
---
Exactly. People in this sub try to police the way other people play the game. Imagine avoiding spell cleave groups yet still finding a way to blame them.
---
Ty my life is complete
---
You run if you pull that amount of mobs at level 10.
---
I actually went with 30 day playtime rather than a sub because I wasn¬¥t sure.
---
I didn¬¥t even manage to play much but I¬¥m considering to get a sub this time or at least like 3 months playtime to get a better deal, since I¬¥m sure I¬¥ll want to keep playing.
---
As a fellow lock... this is priest gear lol
---
I'm rocking a druid, level 48 currently.
---
When I hit 40 I did not have enough gold for my mount (I'm also leveling up enchanting, so it's sucking all my gold). 
---
But I did take a brief break from leveling to grind out some gold for my mount. Why? You ask/ You have travel form, there's really no need for a mount with it.
---
Well, that is kind of true. That extra 20% speed from the mount is definitely noticable across long distances. And that is the true crux of the matter. Long distances.
---
The 40-60 range of level is notorious for needing to hop around to different zones, almost constantly. Doing some of those long runs will add up a lot of time. Are you horde? Travelling to Hinterlands? That is a long run from Tarren Mill. Even with travel form.
---
Add on needing to go to Feralas, Un'goro Crater, Felwood, EPL/WPL, all these places you will have to go to to level at some point in your 40-60 journey. Taking an extra 2-4 hours just grinding out gold to save you that travel time down the road is 100% worth it to me.
---
But you are correct in your judgment of not needing to mount up to travel from mob to mob, that is a time waste when you can just instant travelform or catform (with feline swiftness) to get to that mob.
---
Now this is the wow customer service I know.
---
I am also delaying my mount as a druid and investing all my gold
---
Agreed... They fixed the wrong problem honestly. I think a lot of people still think lowbie ganking gives dishonorable kills... It doesn't
---
Wide Quest Log
---
Yeah now that YOU have your epic mount and 900g.  Oh please fix this so no one can benefit
---
Just needs to be put out before the raid, usually should be said as all BOEs are free roll, some say they are need before greed. If it's not then you need to ask before it happens.
---
As a bear tank, I feel the pain of watching a warden staff drift away when it's that close.
---
&gt; like 3k gold
---
&gt;literaly free
---
I have a hard time thinking of an item that would be more expensive.. Prizes for Elementium Ore might also be high for some time, as servers might have quite a few Thunderfurys ready to go when BWL finally releases. It's somewhere between 0 and 5 ores per reset IIRC. 
---
Not to mention the whole "just wait till it drops" part.
---
I've just accepted I'm not that young anymore.  Lol.  I have some early 20s co-workers.  I'm thirty-three and I barely understand what they're on about.
---
Your point #2 supports layering. You were upset about one group on your layer killing that mob. Imagine if it were ten or fifteen groups
---
as currently we only have MC and onyxia out druid tanks are by far the best tanks. this is as a warrior tank. warriors scale better with gear than druids but we don't have the gear to out scale a druid atm.
---
come T2 we will be equal but in T3 warriors tanks can ether be the better damage reduction tank or the better threat making tank with the fury warrior tank build. druids are the best of both at the same time with the the issue or the crushing critical blow.
---
i don't know what fights in classic that has physical special abilities but those that do are the fights were druids can get randomly one-shot no matter the gear. (i know for a fact this was an issue TBC with certain bosses where there was around 1-0.5% chans every fight the druid might just get one-shot due to this)
---
@NotAllWarriors
---
I'm just gonna chime in because I hate this recommendation and I see it a lot.
---
Don't macro weapon sets to your goddamn stances. It's dumb.
---
What you want to do is macro each stance to cast a stance exclusive ability once you're in that stance.
---
I put shield block on Def stance, Charge on Battle stance and Berseker Rage on Berserker stance.
---
Two clicks to charge, two clicks to block, two clicks to stance dance fear.
---
Wow did that know that, everyday certainly is a school day!!
---
Um, 60. However groups that aren't falling a part retarded have done them with 55-59s sprinkled in them
---
Rob streams nowadays and has a neat custom roleplaying system for twitch that utilizes virtual puppets for all the players and NPCs and has been going for several years at this point. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he was still making content when I looked him up a while back!
---
&gt;Pretty much yeah.
---
Go play retail.
---
Thrall. He was raised as a commander who can unite orcs under Blackmoore's banner. Then he gone unite the orcs anyway after murdering the Blackmoore .
---
Bro I'm lev 45 and broke as hell. Imo travel form is even better cause it's instant
---
Dynamic guard spawning is the real "city raid" killer.
---
So much for the "Vanilla Experience"
---
You mean purely for ww axe? Unless you got it super late you should have it for like 10 levels.
---
RP servers. Everyone is so much more relaxed. It reminds me of the good old days when everyone was terrified of dungeon mobs.
---
There's an obscene amount of things to do, but what you mean is that they're not things you personally want to do.
---
Yes I agree with everything you said. The people who are playing Classic know what they are getting into. If they are still with it, they are unlikely to leave in the first year.
---
I wish someone would create a database where people can report names of ninja's but have to include screenshots as proof
---
I play a resto shaman (one 2min cd insta heal) and after stepping into BRD i learned to hate running dungeons with WLs. I dont have information about your cds, if youre aware that the mobs are doing aoe etc. I have to trust you that its fine if you sit there with 10-30% hp all the time and more often than not I was let down by WL's. The average skill level of players (including healers) doesn't justify this meta of high risk gameplay. But maybe Im just to old and unskilled who knows..
---
Sure, but I'm not sure why people who don't like the content in classic wow would want to jump onboard classic wow.  For me personally I thought I was only going for the sense of nostalgia, but then I realized I actually really like this version of the game more than I've liked anything after wrath.
---
Are you talking about recent developments in retail or am I forgetting details about vanilla Saurfang?
---
I lost the roll for a Warden Staff even thought I was a feral druid tanking the dungeon. Kinda B.S that people think it's okay to roll on my BIS item for the entirety of vanilla lmao
---
3 people in his chat typed LOL simultaneously so he decided this move would be a blast for the entire internet.
---
If you do a cast spell to swp you can get that cast off and instantly dot the target in the process so unless you are hurting for mana it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to do that.
---
What does it matter? Apparently they had not stated any loot rules regarding the run, then decided to roll for the loot, when he won the roll they just looked for excuse to ninja the item. Pretty typical ninja looters.
---
They obviously tried to "play it fair" by allowing him to roll for the item hoping their priest wins the roll, but had to resort into ninja looting.
---
That's incredible for a 'lock (high stam)
---
Similar for cat feral dps. They need very few items and do competitive dps when played properly. They almost always want items no one else cares about outside of trinkets and rings.
---
I'm one of the lucky ones, an actual tank main :)
---
Tank queue never ceases to amaze me
---
This tickled me
---
Yeah, it's kind of mind-blowing honestly. Before launch, post after post would be "play what and how you want, don't let elitists tell you how to play!". The worst though is a thread I saw complaining that a specific gold farming method should be nerfed because it favored mages. What happened to the love for the diversity and non homogenization of classes?
---
That‚Äôs what you pick up a holy for ?
---
&gt; Classic just inspires kindness.
---
That's a great way to put it.  Retail doesn't, and has removed any consequence for rudeness.
---
Go to the realm forums and blast it in chat.
---
For threat yes, for mitigation it's warden staff. So it depends :)
---
your leather stacks are vendor because theres 20k skinners of that level on your realm. try higher level leathers
---
Im at 12-15 runs and its been vice grips..every..fucking..run without exception

Its really not surprising that guild pugs prio their own guildies over giving tier pieces to randoms.

Not saying its not scumbaggy but its really not surprising.

That's the one
---
ya,  some nights of PvP pre-60 would be nice. Doubt that will happen tho. Already level 43
---
spawn camp bt.
---
wait until a hunter starts taming it.
---
pull BT off the hunter (this will break tame) and/or kill it.
---
If the hunter is the opposing faction, kill the hunter too.
---
Congrats, you've learned how to PVP both factions.
---
Had the same feeling when playing Classic. Never played Vanilla and I though Rexxar was introduced to WoW with BC. Was really surprised as Alliance to stumble upon a "skull" level Rexxar in the middle of nowhere :D
---
&gt;How much is thid at auctions?
---
It'd mad by combining two BoP blue swords.  It can't be AH'd.
---
Normal ragnaros ends at 10% and heroic raggy has 4 phases...
---
It requres quite a few of mooncloth. If you make it yourself you need at least 40 days to get the necessary amount plus there are also some rare reagents (I look at you, golden pearl) and ghost dye that must be crafted by another player. This damn piece of chest is expensive.
---
^^ Do this if you want everyone to consider you a total wanker
---
Exploiting what exactly?
---
That hasn't been my experience at all.  I've been 60 for about a week now, and there's more to do now than there was at any point before.
---
Herod NA east peak times around 2 hours
---
Not me. I‚Äôm the one getting jumped most the time. Level 36 undead shadow priest
---
Man, this community is a fucking joke sometimes.
---
"Hey guys, I actually don't consider being ganked repeatedly while leveling to be a fun experience. Just saying."  
---
"Look at this whiny little bitch lmao! You rolled on a PvP server, deal with it! Why don't you go back to *retail* if you can't handle classic, bitch? Lol got'em!"
---
For pure damage output, sure. But with Witchblade and Drakestone that's only +21 spell damage. Pretty marginal when you consider that this staff gives you your own intellect buff and 300 more HP. It depends what you want. I would take headmaster's charge especially in PvP and switch to your Witchblade and Drakestone during a raid.
---
sounds like you want to play retail m+ and not classic
---
Classic really has a shitty loot system. 
---
Classic + is what we need.
---
What's the best PvP realm in terms of community, pvp, and stable population? I was thinking about herod or faerlina
---
There is definitely a connection between undead and gnome players, and people who gank for no reason. This is not just confirmation bias, I think they pick these races because their mission is specifically to piss people off.
---
You are going to protest climate? What did the climate ever do to you?
---
Haha I joined a Scholo group as a rogue the other day and once I got to the dungeon and picked the door for the group the tank kicked me because Mr. Warrior didn't want competition on "his" Cadaverous Chest.
---
Yeah... I had a warr tank leave a BRD arena farm last night when we got a shaman. He didn't even want to compete against him for the chest. 
---
Its toxic, but I get it. I ran BRD all yesterday for that stupid belt, only to finally get a drop and lose the roll to another mage.
---
Huh? Is this for real? I could have sworn I've heard other people /train before..
---
Mages and Warriors that only leveled in dungeons, using only a few abilities? Damn, why am I on a PvE-Server? This must be like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Pretty sure there is a ret pala currently running around with hand of ragnaros... how does that make you feel?
---
Have you ever been in a spell cleave group? You absolutely need to know your class to succeed in them. Mages need to time and rotate novas properly, iceblock at the right time, coordinate who blizzards and who AEs, use polymorph on mobs that just don't want to get grouped up. The priest has to preshield, use fear when necessary, re-shield the mages that AE, time prayer of healing properly if needed. You know what I do as a healer in a regular group? Spam one Heal and fall asleep. You know what mages do? Spam Frostbolt, use polymorph sometimes and blizzard when there's 5+ mobs.
---
If you honestly think that you don't need to know your class to do spell cleave then you're just a part of the mindless spell cleave hate circlejerk.
---
well u have few safe nets ... mainly death coil as it is short fear with nice chunk of heal/dmg. also you can pre cast howl of terror and then keep fearing with corr/sl/coa on mobs
---
Good guy blizz :)
---
You're invoking a previously casted seal, right? Shamans have to focus their energy on the cast.
---
Thank you for your detailed insight! I definitely understand you, Long distances is a pain in the cheetah a** but yea... I thought mostly you will have that 21 secs travel thats not really that much of a difference either side.. so I could buy my abilities as normal
---
it forces you to speak demonic
---
Knew it was Echeyakee by the second paragraph.
---
There's always people there trying to ninja your quest mob. I thought they were just a random assortment of bored Barrens assholes. Perhaps they're just turbo noobs.
---
Oh ok
---
56 warr. 
---
2 taunts, 10 sec and 2m cd. i keep the 2m reserved to pull something off the healer if taunt is resisted.
---
demo spam on 6+ targets. rotate sunders on 3-4.
---
i think dps should wait for sunders. if they get aggro right away it's their fault. i will taunt one and try to build rage to taunt the next one off the healer.
---
faves are mara and brd.
---
Yeah from a toy.    But you can only hear laugh and cry emotes when not grouped
---
Nah...was just talking about retail :D
---
Well i did not manage to sell the cd yet, but i do manage to sell the bars on the AH, mostly about 5-7g profit. Although once i bought the crystal at a wrong time and the market shifted and i lose 1g :D
---
If you're a hc druid tank fear is not a problem. You go blacksmithing and pick up the immunity trinket.

To be fair to everyone, I think retail has spoiled us all a wee bit.
---
I thought ninja looting was needing when you should be greeding (because of class/spec/whatever). But this Ultix guy actually gets the loot while rolling lower than Ricky. How is that possible? Have i been misunderstanding ninja looting?
---
Nothing beats my first time playing WoW in vanilla. I was in Durotar on the quest to get the amulet from the named Orc in the caves. Sounds easy right? Turns out I thought the named Orc was a player that was corpse camping me. I was trying to send it tells and all. 
---
This was my 2nd MMO. I came from Everquest and was used to same races attacking each other on pvp servers.
---
GOD DAMNIT SHIT
---
I expected a story or at *least* a chat screenshot about 'why the mage was a dick', but yeah, it really feels like you're shitting on the mage just to shit on him with this post.
---
If you're having downtime as a druid, then you're doing it wrong :P
---
Ah yes the dick mage, master of cock magic and general phallacy.
---
Should be "no cataclysm for our azeroth" in my opinion.
---
Bipedal worgens exist in classic
---
&gt; rip my karma btw
---
Well that‚Äôs what happens when you shitpost.
---
I think that misconception was smashed very quickly after release tbh. I usually get a bunch of kind words about people loving druids when I join groups. I haven't really seen many discouraging memes about any spec anymore. I think people are starting to realize how viable most things are in some capacity.
---
I love it, its double sided so i custom ordered a double glass frame with ability to hang from hooks in the middle of a room... Now i just need a spare room...

So thats what people mean when they say they have big dick DPS...
---
Constant danger to get 1 shot by 3 skull level folk =\= constant danger to run into opponents roughly my equal. 
---
But I agree it's part of a PvP server. No idea what people get out of it tho :p
---
I don't say it's a violation and don't come at me with ToS. I know it's allowed. This is more about if it's good that it is allowed.
---
This discussion here has more heart in it than I thought it would. Maybe I hit a weak spot for some players. I think I derailed the discussion and will shut up now. But thanks for the insight of all of you. I think I'm smarter now :P
---
Im not sure, there may not be as many hunters now but pretty much every time if grouped with a male NE hunter they have fucked up in some pure head tilt WTF HOW? Kinda way. Mages just fuck up in a I have no idea what im doing kinda way for hunters its an art form. 
---
Tbf though you have to have something not wired up right to think male night elves are a correct choice in any scenario.
---
Can confirm this is 100% accurate
---
In my experience it takes anywhere from 20-40 minutes to get the group to BRD after the group has been formed. Every. Single. Time.
---
we have DOTs. we can DOT every mob and then melee the party target. we do damage.
---
If you bring PuGs then you gotta give them equal chance at the loot. May not be surprising but they should be called out so people don't group with them. Recruit and run a full guild raid if you want to prio your own guild.
---
i'm waiting for someone to make one for pallys that's just a single consecrate
---
Yeah, you want to quest through STV, but it's STV so it's a clusterfuck
---
To make you feel better. You cant tag their mob. When they summon it its their tag and no matter who hits it first.
---
Source: Me couple of days ago summoning this mob and there was a group that killed it before i got reach it and only i got to loot it. They were confused as hell. Thanks for kiling my mob lads.
---
I found the album after your comment, I never felt so bad for Mankrik before.
---
Im glad I slaughter those quillboars for him
---
I ended up leaving Skeram with my guild the other day. We noticed that no alliance were around anymore really. Last night we logged on alliance and did /who class 60 and were able to count about 320 level 60s online as none of the classes were capped at 50 during prime time. Over half our guild left and the new server. So far it has been fun every zone has both horde and alliance running around but you can tell there is more alliance. We were actually able to get devilsaur leather as Onslaught cartel wasn't around. We even world PvPd which we were not use to and it was fun.
---
We would kill any alliance we saw as it was a rare sight to see one. Sitting outside instances waiting for our group or resetting the dungeon killing more.
---
fat dog!
---
Level 60, after you have good gear.

Raids are 20-40 player ‚Äúdungeons that can take 1-6 hours to do depending on skill level. Takes coordination and can be difficult for pugs for obvious reasons. Good guilds have them on farm

Don‚Äôt worry. You will see it drop and then have the entire party roll against you for it so they can sell it on the auction house.
---
I can tell you for sure that the reverse works (undead running to Valley of Trials) so it‚Äôs probably fine.
---
I read the "generated high threat" and asked myself why would I ever use it? I've never trained it.
---
It's not in a terrible state, you just don't like the market price because you want to sell goods to make gold. People that want to buy things are happy because their gold gets them more of what they need.

Definitely wasn't Heroic, we were all baddies. So must have been 13% instead of 3.

Woah, so you are clearly one of those people: "Everyoneelse is wrong but me and if you do not agree fk u".Was a noob back in bc and never played vanilla, whats so bad about asking lmao, your last sentence just exposed what kind of reprobate you are, im just exposing my opinion not shoving it down others throat, go crawl beneath the rock you came for.
---
Faerlina is primarily the streamer server so just be aware of that
---
What do you mean, eating ? If you're a tank, bandaging is enough. I've never bought food for my warr from lvl 1-60.
---
I'm OOTL, whats "cleave"?
---
60? It's 2 raids, so 80 at least if not more
---
Al‚Äôakir has been around since vanilla
---
I'm not shitting on them for optimizing the game. But I think this is what I'll dislike the most while playing Classic. People follow a meta more strictly now and everyone can read a guide about how to play the game etc, which means things like world bosses and some materials will be tagged by a select few guilds per server and there'll be no room for anyone else to get it.
---
Back in Vanilla this wasn't the case until way later in the expansion and even then it wasn't uncommon for regular MC and BWL Guilds to tag and kill a few nightmare dragons every now and then or Kazzak. 
---
Also with phase 2 people will game the system that very few even knew all the details about back when Vanilla introduced the PvP system. So now we will have a bunch of guilds gaming it hard by camping hot spots like EPL flight paths or Kargath etc. Something that people really never did back then for any other reason than to get laughs out of it for an hour or so. This time people will make it a farm fest and sit there for days probably just to get their pvp gear. 
---
We may have the game back to its roots but the experience will never match the experience we had then.
---
So I can safely tank with my Dodge rogue?
---
Use discord voice chat. You're welcome. If you are relying on pugs at 60, you have bigger problems than a chat ban. Find a guild with a discord and you'll rarely use chat again.

Currently saving fir a mount as well. I decided to start saving early, got about 25gold coins at lvl 31. A good way I had to make gold is to buy cheap leather and skins at AH, craft leather shoulders and  then directly selling it to a merchant (not at AH). I manage to find crafting materials that actually are cheap enough to make a profit 
---
Like I pay about 7-8silvers of materials for something I sell 12silver coins at a merchant. I just buy a shit ton of materials, I‚Äôve been able to make about 10g in a week this way, and it‚Äôs quite easy. You just have to look at the AH.
---
tortured people in the cathedral ? meh
---
That's mildly unsettling.
---
Found a "Grizzly Buckler of Holy Wrath" in the AH a lvl 8 shield with +3 holy spellpower.
---
This is being asked everyday. I think I have commented on 5 different warriors to give them advice about macros. Also bind icons to F1-F7. 
---
Please search the forum first.
---
It's true but I think it wasn't strictly enforced unless you used insults.
---
I protest the panda all filth that plans to ruin out world
---
Was going to post something but this guy knows it. Used your HoTs to help generate threat. Your initial enrage and shapeshift rage should allow for 2 or 3 swipes then mail with the best of them. I should also mention that in aoe comps with three or 4 mages your job isn't actually to hold threat, but rather to efficiently pull and gather up the mobs.
---
I'm sorry for my ignorance, but what does that mean? What's wrong with the streamers?
---
Exactly.
---
Wow easy there tough guy. 
---
My """"""anecdotal""""" evidence such as Warriors being able to tank dungeons, or shamans getting ghost wolf?
---
Such a paladins being the easiest class when blizzard quite literally stated that it was a class meant for beginners? 
---
I can log on right now and take a screen shot of the LFG chat on my server if you want, but we both know it'll be 80% "AOE". Oh wait, actually, I don't even need to do that since you conceded that fact in another thread literally less than an hour ago.
---
&gt;I mainly hate that they wont shut the fuck up in LFG.
---
No ones crying cos they are leveling slower, any one can roll a mage if they want, I just want these people to chill out in /LFG
---
Woops.
---
What other anecdotal evidence do I need to prove to you? lmao
---
Ashenvale should be fine for you.
---
This is no excuse to ninja but if you did so little healing that it was as if you weren't even there then I could at least understand the desire to just give it to a guild member.
---
Lvl 34 pally on a PvP server, looking at the best ways of being effective against opposition (and also getting good at duelling).
---
I have a basic strategy: from my understanding I have 4 spells available to me to prevent me being attacked : Blessing of Freedom, Divine Protection, Blessing of Protection and Divine Shield. BoF has a 20s cooldown as opposed to the others' 5min so something that can be re-used in one fight. 
---
During this rotation of defensive spells, attack with Seal of Command/Righteousness and Judge whenever possible. Obviously Hammer of Justice whenever possible, probably right at the start of the fight.
---
Any other ideas/tips to be effective in this situation for a pally?
---
&gt; Strat UD Healer robe locked - lf healer This robe is BIS slot for all healing classes except priests and even there its affordable BIS. Why this strange group? Because the healing druid is tanking but will still need that robe. It's easier to find a healer that needs other stuff from Strat UD (quests, loot etc...) then to find a tank.
---
Also, why isn't the healer that needs the robe healing?  I mean, it's straight +heal not damage and heal.  Honestly, if I was a healer I wouldn't take the run even if I have the robe, because now I know someone else in the group is interested in any other potential healing gear I want.
---
I'm suggesting that the pet crits more and sometimes mobs dodge is a dumb argument.
---
so paladins are an actual useful class afterall =/
---
Personally I want to start playing less. Doing the occasional dungeon and raiding will slow down my play time a bit.
---
When I play in a 20 man raid am I trying to heal all 20 people or are we in 4 groups of 5 or some other method? How is loot handed out? 
---
Thank you for your first response!
---
&gt; iF yOu wAnT suBPar DpS
---
Ony was downed within a week by lvl 55s and by groups of 20 since. Let's stop pretending you need top DPS to achieve anything in Classic.
---
lashing out at loved ones
---
I think I have 2 more months in me. Oddly i feel like playing retail now even though i know id quit that after a month.
---
As a mage I am typically right there beside you, drinking like a maniac. How do they stay on top of their mana? A shit load of spirit?
---
Close to even alliance:horde ratio, waayyyy less ganking, waaaayyyyhyh fewer wannabe edgelords, waaaaayyyyyyyy better wpvp. If horse starts ganking the alliance will form a 10-20 man raid in a few minutes to drive them off. I was able to quest in STV for hours without being ganked once because an alliance rp guild posted up to kill gankers during an event. 
---
I felt like I was competing with other alliance on stalagg. Everyone was so sick of the ganks so they‚Äôd rush through questing. Even if that means avoiding pvp while people are getting ganked around them or stealing an escort quest. On Grobb it feels like we‚Äôre all in the same team and working together.
---
I'm so happy to see you state this. I posted in the Daily Question thread and asked why everyone kept saying "just go with the slow weapon" instead of "just go with the highest damage weapon" and every idiot in town came out to explain to me why I wanted a slow weapon. They didn't want to hear that I understood that slow usually means higher damage range to make up for the dps, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should be telling noobs to "just go with the slowest weapon". It was/is maddening.
---
Honestly idk I‚Äôve never asked.
---
Everyone on this subreddit complaining about ninja looters are justifying Blizzard's reasoning for personal loot in BFA.
---
Typical macho man rogue.
---
Sylvanas imo is a pretty good villain with an interesting personal motivation to 'justify' her actions. But the writers are incapable of fleshing this out in a non-anime way.
---
I get a lot of whispers to join spellcleave groups even though I'mon Grob, but I'm always playing with my Priest friend.
---
Aren't we talking alliance warlock against any forsaken here? Against them you use fear &gt; stun &gt; fear.
---
He could make a macro explaining his situation.
---
Anyone who reacts negatively to that isn¬¥t a person he would wanna be friends with anyway.
---
Everyone who remains is likely a nice person to be around.
---
They have guns though.
---
Wow. Great joke from 2006, buddy.
---
For my runs blue is the axe, red is the armor... still trying to get the cloth belt from Arena as mage... Seen one HoJ drop during early full run.
---
No, you wanted Classic, and it's exactly what you're getting.  Bgs and hks didn't exist a month into vanilla...
---
The satisfaction!
---
Ricky rolled?
---
He'll never give up that loot
---
Personally I felt fixed-cost dkp was best loot system I've ever worked with. The caveat to it was that players wearing shit gear had to take big upgrades and pay for them rather than getting carried in greens and blues and then using their points for one of the major weapons or cross-class loot.  
---
Overall it worked out really well, and also took the pressure off of officers.  Either you had the highest available dkp or you didn't.  No class cartels that often form with closed bid dkp systems.  I suppose an open bid dkp system could work, but if two players don't like each other and one knows the other really wants something, they might bid up the price just so the other person has to pay a ransom, and that creates drama.  
---
Fixed cost no-bid dkp systems are a great solution for any raid.
---
I'm also on this server and very much recognise your description of how people interact.
---
This thread is the first time I've even heard of the word spellcleave. I don't play retail at all, so maybe that helps?
---
Not as good as TBC because the leveling is slower and harder, but definitely better than retail
---
I was lucky, got help from a couple of guildies for most of it, managed to buy the burning charms off ah for 90silver an absolute steal.
---
He‚Äôs WoW version of Garruk
---
Sure separate the sub fee make classic cost only 3$/month I don't need to pay 18$ for retail anyway
---
I agree if OP died on pull and was dead the entire fight meanwhile the other healer lived and pulled a some clutch shit to get the boss down in addition to being their guildie then im not surprised or upset at this.
---
Anything you die from on ony is your fault. Plain and simple. You aren't entitled to loot by virtue of being present. How is it fair to give someone who didnt contribute to the fight loot? This is a common practice in PUGs not to reward the worst players. Also when loot is on masterloot the distribution of loot is left to the discretion of the masterlooter.
---
If you want gear in a pug dont be bad plain. I don't know what "lowish" means, you said early on so I'm guessing you were last. Prolly tail whipped into whelps. There is literally no other way to die unless you were standing on the tanks. 
---
People like you are the reason personal loot exists on retail. Blizzard got sick of people crying about loot after 13 years. If you want a fair shot at loot on every boss, regardless of your contributions to the group, maybe classic isn't for you.
---
Not really.  
---
Stamina is really far down stat priority list:
---
`Spell Power (or +Shadow Damage);`
---
1. `Spell Crit Chance;`
---
2. `Hit Chance until 16%;`
---
3. `Spell Penetration`
---
4. `Intellect;`
---
5. `Stamina;`
---
6. `Spirit.`

Are you being purposely obtuse? That's obviously not what i'm talking about here.

Remove Layering and reduce Max Active Player Cap. This would bring the experience in line with Vanilla.
---
I just got wand from the Noxxion the other day. and at the same time hit 48. how does DPS of that wand compares to draining life ?
---
actualy scarlet monastary was planed to be a raid.
---
It should get overwritten. Not sure if it benefits com the bonus heal tho.
---
I mean, onyx is scale cloak is necessary...
---
Dwarf will also help against clean vanish from warriors. I've never played melee which is why I don't know how much being stuck in place will bother me lol. On my current mage, rogues can't touch me and if they had escape artist, I'm sure it would be a closer fight. Maybe not though since my first reaction is to slow them again with a rank 1 frostbolt, COC, or Nova.

Was on Stalagg. Had 15k+ queues too. Then, no queues. 
---
Heartseeker was dead af and has now so many players it‚Äôs pretty crazy. On census, went from 300 chars to over 40k. 
---
That‚Äôs where your queues went buddy, along with other realms.
---
It's when you post in public pug lfg or general channels for reserved items, that makes the "issue" more visible than it is. 
---
You can do what you want, but there will always be people like that disagree with it. And there's nothing we can do to filter it out. You think it's this gigantic hassle to get a group together and are providing a service, but are still somehow in lfg looking for members all day like the rest of us.
---
Is it allowed? Yes! Is it obnoxious in a public setting? yes!
---
nah youll be fine ally on pagle not participating in pvp suck ass at pvp im guessing. more hks for the horde!
---
Yeah, the music is the best, is the same that sounds in Warcraft 3 intro, so it really takes the player back!
---
Yea but his senior game dev friend said so, so it has to be the truth right? This guy wouldn't dare lie on the internet right?
---
yep my friend who's played vanilla since about 1.2 doesn't know how to wait before dps'ing that's definitely it
---
You literally said "You need to understand the class" as if you knew what the fuck you're talking about, which evidently you dont. 
---
Now if you wanna say something else try communicating like an actual human being.
---
The macro I posted does everything on a single key press for one global cooldown.  That is because stance changes don't trigger globals, the weapon swaps do.
---
If you were to pair the equip changes with say Bash you would have to press the button twice and would have two globals.  I would also put the skill last as you would want to equip the shield prior to using it.
---
Yep! I came as a pug to an Ony kill in vanilla, and when the Helm I‚Äôd Wrath dropped, they wanted to DE it for the shard instead of giving it to me since none of them needed it. Only got it because my ex was in the guild and argued and promised to pay them a shard value for it. Ridiculous.
---
I want to know this as well as this build is the reason I rerolled Druid.
---
Well nothing is really wrong with them but it does shift the dynamic of the server a bit. Large groups of people could form around a single player, or the streamer could hold organized events that would effect your ability to do something.  For example you‚Äôre trying to farm but so is the streamer along with the 10+ other people in his entourage. Suddenly those mobs are harder and harder to farm versus on a non-streamer server where you‚Äôd just be competing against that single player. 
---
Know what I mean? Someone whose actually on Faerlina might wanna chime in here as it might not be as bad as I‚Äôm making it seem.
---
If you want trade chat to look like twitch chat, roll faerlina
---
An Orc by any other name would be just as sweet.
---
Mirage Raceway Horde. Often there is hardly any node left in entire zone (i have both herbs &amp; mining). And stuff certainly sells on AH. First 2 weeks after release nothing of high-level stuff was selling but after that things changed a lot.
---
I'm confused, can you ELI5 why you're manually rolling for loot vs need/greed?  Are raids run differently than the dungeons I've been running?
---
That's a lot of stoney boiz!
---
They should just add an op mob up there that oneshots you or something like that. Like a shark with laser shooting eyes
---
FeelsBadMan
---
It'll probably get worse honestly, as people get the bulk of the items they want, and start targeting specifics.
---
It's worth it, the riding for lvl 40 and lvl 60 is only 20g, it's the mount that's expensive
---
I meant in general, far too many believes it should be banned, I don't blame em, when AV first came out there was always a Multiboxing shamen in them, hell I likely made posts on the wow forums demanding it banned at one point when I first found em.
---
Regardless it should be allowed, it's about player freedom at the end of the day.
---
Apologies for the if I offended you, never my intent when it comes down to wow, unless you're the opposite faction...
---
Yeah, we had a long list of ninja names in our guild with screenshots to back them up with. Even had to demote and then kick out an officer that vouched for one such individual.
---
People tend to forget how serious it was back in the day
---
Only possible on Brasilian servers
---
Well I know now you‚Äôre not an idiot but just over thinking it. 
---
This has nothing to do with the economy but about gearing up your character. If the item dropped is an upgrade for you, meaning you are going to equip it, you roll need. 
---
If it‚Äôs a nice boost to your wallet you roll greed. 
---
That‚Äôs it. The end. That‚Äôs how it was meant to work. Everything else is just players twisting it for their own selfish reasons and then the rest following so not to get screwed.
---
That's honestly not too different from my server with hopefully more casuals than hardcore players (Gandling).
---
Trying to prove what buddy?
---
I agreed with you that of course AOE grinding is faster?
---
What do you want out of this interaction?
---
OP : How hard/slow is rogue leveling?
---
Me : Its not great, but its not that bad
---
You : AOE GRIND IS FAR SUPERIOR! PROVE ME WRONG!!!! 
---
Okay dude, you win! +1 to your sense of self worth for epic win in reddit discussion!
---
Or we could follow the subreddits rules.
---
Al'akir is a server name on eu. It wasn't just one raid, guy was at it all through tier 7
---
He's quoting the sub's rules word for word.
---
No one beyond Arugal players cares about this.
---
Blizzard owning up to a mistake. Good.
---
Personally, I would level Combat swords until lvl 30. Then switch to Subtlety to get Hemorrhage. 
---
Here is the build I used: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/--500250030230001
---
Keep in mind, if you don't have a dagger main hand, then I would probably put three points into initiative rather than improved ambush.
---
Yeah, I used to be that helpful Ally. Not killing Hordies way lower level than me, leaving them alone if they have mobs on them etc. But higher level Horde come through and kill and camp me and spam "go back to retail". So, since I can't do anything to the higher levels my only course of action is to slaughter everyone lower level than me. Bonus points if they are pulling mobs or doing a quest because thats what they do to me.
---
I think most of the clams showed up around 5pm server time
---
The pearl drop rate is shit though
---
Do you have any screenshots of an agreement prior to entering the raid of what the conditions were for looting?
---
So you are telling me that 20 int is irrelevant, so lets see you unequip your chest piece since it don't matter either. Im not saying its large, but given all 4 party members(in a caster/healer group in a raid) can utilize it, that staff has 100 int.
---
*hug*. TBC for me.
---
It‚Äôs a clear exploit that you can survive there without dying to the guards, and only works for ranged classes. It‚Äôs not PvP at that point so much as shooting fish in a barrel when a level 60 lock or spriest throws DoTs on a level 40-45 player. Blizzard has a pretty clear stance on this and for good reason.
---
It was on asmongold (or whatever his name is) twitch I believe.
---
Was the paladin ret, or healing as a favor?
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool that the guild would do that for him. Press F.
---
I'm more of a low hanging fruit kind of person.  Sometimes there's a piece of gear that's pre-raid bis that's a significant advantage, that may be more valuable than many gear upgrades combined.  You'd better believe I'm going to target that item.  I'm not all that concerned about making it to 100% pre-raid bis, but I'd like get to a point where I have about 80% of the stats of pre-raid bis.  Sure you don't need it for entry tier raids, but it's going to make everything easier.  A couple very strong players can go a long way in carrying a raid at this point.  Be it tank, dps, or heals.  And when that's in place, other people can shift focus to, I dunno, maybe raiding in a pvp hybrid spec if they want to.  At the end of the day it's about group cohesion, and establishing that now will set you up for all of classic.
---
If you have an Nvidia graphics card try moonlight instead
---
Considering there are [much worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d9fuk1/a_warrior_in_my_guild_just_got_the_sluttiest/) things that not only aren't changed in classic but are also still the same in retail, I really doubt this is the case.
---
Priest here...I get to join both LOL.
---
Doesn't matter if OP is dead.
---
Then how could he perform better compared to people who get loot if he doesn't get loot? Not to mention poor performance goes both ways, the guild was organized and managed poorly enough thst they had to rely on pugs to get the kill. So maybe the guild shouldnt get any loot at all. When you take in pugs as a guild and don't state specific loot rules you have to take the risk of them winning loot over your guild membersx and that's all because your guild wasn't able to organize and manage a full raid group. They should just learn be better so they don't have to ninja from pugs. But hey why would they ever want to admit that they are bad too?
---
you can do not bad AoE thrat with druid, you just need to cast regrowth on yourself, run in, rejuv and switch to bear before first hit. The heal ticks add fairly decent amount of threat to mobs in the fray. Still no where near the warrior, but enough to allow Mages to AoE earlier without peeling everything instantly.
---
I saw this recently too and once you see it you can‚Äôt unsee it... I was dying laughing.  Is the ones in winterspring only?  Or other yetis also?
---
Also you misunderstood that, when I said you need to understand the class im refering to averyone who plans to level a rogue, tools like stealth, distract and cc broken on damage are tools easy to use but hard to master and are essential for a optimal playthrough.
---
U wot m8
---
Link please?
---
It‚Äôs true though, on wowhead hoj is 1.5% Tbh don‚Äôt even bother if you can‚Äôt handle minimum 100 runs
---
Wow you're kinda an asshole aren't you?
---
What you say is only fair if before the raid it was explained that if you fuck up then you dont get loot
---
Think whatever you want, it‚Äôs been allowed throughout the lifetime of WoW.
---
Fuck that guild.
---
I see you already got pet bis from DM.
---
Yeah that's the one I was thinking of. Massive waste of an item but oh well.
---
Paladin was DPSing warrior was taking. Druid was healing as a favor but is speccd to tank
---
Just raid without ruin. 
---
Ruin increases the damage of your crits by 33% which at 10%crit Chance is a measly 3,3% more dps.
---
MC and ony can be 20 Manned easily so who cares about ~3-5% more dps
---
We aren‚Äôt all bad, but I agree some warriors and mages this play through my god, make me want to tear my hair out some conversations lol.
---
The ol /roll in case you win and don‚Äôt have to ninja. 50% of the time it works every time
---
Looks like a solid build. Some priests (like Hydra) are good deep into Disc, because it's not that hard to heal atm.
---
Dungeon finder now!
---
A lot of people auto walk on that final path to the boat, if you‚Äôre not paying attention distract will make them run towards the direction of the rogues choosing causing a lot of people to run off the ledge
---
Best for mitigation, yes. Best for threat is Manual Crowd Pummeller. Not even Atiesh gives you more threat.
---
Dark Souls should always be expected. It's the Spanish Inquisition you need to worry about.
---
I swear Blizzard released Classic to make us appreciate 14 years of patches to remove bullshit like this.
---
Im failing to see a ninja. The dude wanted a mace and rolled on the mace.
---
Ninja != winning roll on item you wanted/needed
---
The rule is there for a good reason...
---
ppl have been saying.... which means you werent there at retail vanilla. So why even reply here, rlly nothing to do in life than to reply on 500 topics a day?
---
Spitting at your screen? Damn you got passion.
---
I like to just MC them, run towards the edge and then stop. Let them sweat it out for the rest of the boat ride.
---
Everything will be worth more when more people are 60 and trying to sugar daddy their alts
---
So if I say I really really really want an item I get loot priority?
---
Nothing is being forced on anybody.
---
When you want to do spellcleave you join a spellcleave group.
---
And yes, I do have more fun spellcleaving. It feels epic to kill 25 epic mobs.
---
Well yeah they can reserve, but then you should be able to as well.
---
&gt;  You aren't entitled to loot by virtue of being present
---
You absolutely are entitled to rewards for your time commitment. By simply being present you contributed to the fight.
---
I could have sworn that there was a blue post stating exactly the opposite. If there was a "deal" made in chat prior the raid, it would hold weight. Ninja-ing is against the rules.
---
Pretty sure the names originally derive from Arena on retail. In the arena meta, certain comps would be called "melee cleaves" or "spell cleaves" which are traditionally just as they sound, a melee/melee/healer or caster/caster/healer setup, both of which with several different variations. I'm assuming this was then extrapolated by high level players to classic, and in classic context it means a group composition consisting of primarily all casters or melee dps.
---
What did he do in retail ... other than have his son get scourged.
---
Witch hunting is allowed now?
---
Bears can tank if they make the proper preparations, just like warriors or even pallys in my opinion.
---
Just gotta put the effort in, my warrior friend mocked me when I tried to tank a regular 5 man but little does he know that a lot of my gear lacked stamina nor was I specced into any of the "tanking" talents in feral. I have nothing to prove so I dont really let it bother me. Ive raided with bear tanks and have seen firsthand they are capable.
---
This. Blizzard likes money.
---
I'm having so much fun on my druid I am baffled you find it boring. If I want I can cast spells and attack with my weapon or go cat or if I get bored of cat I go bear. It's madness you find it boring.
---
The one in my comment would do both commands with one click.
---
A macro only needs to be pressed multiple times if there are multiple lines in the macro which triggers the global cooldown (GCD - the 1sec cooldown that applies after casting abilities etc).
---
Changing stances doesn't trigger the GCD so the macro will move onto the next step, equipping the weapon.
---
But if we added 'Charge' to the macro like so:
---
/equip 2hander  
---
/cast Charge  
---
Now the first click would switch you to Battle Stance and change your weapon. Changing your weapons triggers the GCD, so the macro would stop there. The second click would cast Charge. 
---
Note: The macro would ignore the first 2 lines on second click. Because you are already in Battle Stance and have the weapon equipped, the first 2 lines won't do anything.
---
Yes, of course.
---
Dude, it's so unnerving haha! I saw it on the ones in feralas. I tried doing it with my own toes and failed, cant imagine doing it on both feet at the same time while also getting beat to death!
---
Oh ok I completely agree with you there.
---
It's horrible as a shadow priest, not only can I not drink hot I have to offheal because the healer can't keep up. Which then means my only damage is wanding.
---
I'm actually leveling a druid now just so I don't have to worry about Mana so much
---
What's a good website that keeps track of server stats, like population, class, etc?
---
Yes I got a NE rogue, so no sword bonus.
---
Is that you Tseric?
---
Pretty much. It sells to hunters as cheap pet food though.
---
I think it's neat how each race (atleast on alliance idk about horde) has their own language, so you could smack talk your friends right in front of their face and they wouldn't know lol

Which bad place were you touched? Loot has never been performance based in PUGs. I have played wow since late vanilla, through tbc, wotlk and parts of cata. I have done many PUGs and never ever has loot been performance based.
---
The only reason someone is allowed to take loot for themselves is if they explicitly state that the items are reserved when they find people for the raid. 
---
Who decides who has performed well enough to get loot? Where is the line drawn? What if i am a healer and get killed early on because i tried to heal someone who pulled whelps and got aggro on myself? What if someone else pulls aggro from tank and her tail whips me onto the whelps, or if the fire breath catches me? It is basically impossible to always know who has performed well enough and who hasnt. And the bar for performing well enough is subjective for each raid leader.
---
People like you look for any excuse to ninja loot.
---
Hey, sorting doesnt work with any bag addon in classic.
---
I guess none of us should follow rules anymore. We are all free to ninja anything we want now. Rules don't apply.
---
&gt; Are raids run differently than the dungeons I've been running?
---
Generally, some groups like to use Master Looter on raids, to ensure that certain pieces of loot go to people who will actually use them, as opposed to letting say, a priest roll Need on a warrior piece just so they can DE for a shard later.
---
It also has been clouding people‚Äôs judgement. For whatever reason, some people don‚Äôt have a dps chart addon, so they have no idea who‚Äôs doing well and who sucks. 
---
We were doing a cleave style group at ST. It was me (ret paladin), a mage, warlock, warrior, and priest healer. Me and the warrior were kicking ass, doing 300-350 dps per pull. The mage was incredibly inconsistent, but averaging about 300 dps a pull. And the warlock sucked and was doing 70-100 dps a pull. 
---
At the end of the dungeon the priest says, ‚ÄúWow spell cleave goes so smooth! Thanks for the carry mage and warlock!‚Äù
---
It turns out it was just data collected by an addon so it's extremely incomplete but still a bit better than the reddit surveys since it's much wider than just reddit. 
---
Here it is, though I'm much less interested now that I realize it's still not a complete dataset (why wont they give us this??????)
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Just an inventory full of Manual Crowd Pummeler right?
---
Disagree. Not only was it a fun adventure but I didn't replace the chest until a plate piece at lvl 40. That's 20 levels of use. Not bad at all.
---
I've had ww axe since 30 and at level 45 I still don't see much I'd rather have.
---
They haven't really announced any plans for the future.
---
Haha this guy gets it.
---
I killed several more I didn‚Äôt need for the quest just because it made me laugh they like do a twinkle toe thing it‚Äôs so hard to explain
---
I like playing both.
---
We don't know what the loot rules were or weren't, nothing was posted except a /roll and someone receiving loot... Regardless, in your example, if you mind blast and pull before tanks have done anything you may as well be an AFK. Would you award people loot if they AFK'd the boss from the start???
---
Of course not. This is an exploit, after all.
---
They clearly value their seconds since they are using "u".
---
Most people will pug if only a specific item or two is on reserve for the guild but if guild gets full priority on \*all\* loot then, yeah, there's no point.
---
How is demo/sac in PvP? I really enjoy affliction's SL and Exhaustion. Currently running SL/ruin, works pretty well but I could probably use another build for more efficient solo play.
---
But those groups wouldn't exist in the first place if cleave groups didn't offer great XP/hour. The people joining them are trying to level quickly, so if cleave groups weren't a thing, they'd just be out solo questing.
---
&gt;!He died (pretty recently)!&lt;
---
So, essentially, each 10-level bracket requires twice as much XP as the last
---
I'm pretty sure there is no way to do this, but I figured I'd ask anyway. I picked up my sister's old Macbook Pro from late 2011 and I get the dreaded "your graphics card is not compatible with World of Warcraft" message when trying to launch Classic. Does anyone know of any workarounds?
---
That explains a lot, thank you lol. The other day I was in Org and a guy was asking for a portal to Org, and I thought he was joking so I told him I‚Äôd do it for 50g and he got mad
---
There should be a subreddit for posts like this! So it would be easier to see and not get buried in all the other posts...
---
Which you can get a few buffs in the early clears that drastically reduce that challenge.  I think our guild is taking a rational approach.  The hard suggestion is everyone needs at least 100 fr, but melee needs to shoot for higher.  You can knock out a good chunk of that just by trying to farm the rest of your gear, and required quests anyway.  But we have a try hard main tank who's convinced he's going to shoot for 300.
---
That just sounds like being a ninja but with extra steps.
---
That lighting engine though.
---
Definitely Mulgore
---
Did you just assume their assumption?
---
This dwarf paladin charges in after all of you... tauren shaman are KOS. Every single one I've ever encountered always attacks first or does the lovely gank so I return the favor as much as possible with gnomish net o matic followed by the gnomish death ray, a stun and judgement, a grenade and judgement, and then repentance and another judgement. You aint getting any heals off
---
You can change the loot options  - basically the leader can give out gear - avoids situations where a hunter needs + wins cloth gear that's BiS for the priests, or someone 'accidentally' needs and ruins the run for someone who actually needs the gear. Some guilds also have a priority system - for example the maintank gets priority on a certain piece of gear.
---
You are about right. You only need 90g btw if honored.
---
dude you got a free entire month? damn i need to jump on that roof haha 
---
obv /s
---
Literally unplayable.
---
*Laughs in Herodian* There are other servers?
---
I had pulled about 8 mobs in wpl when a priest invites me to group. I figure okay for now because I was low health thought he needed something. Then a glowing brightwood staff epic drops we both need and he wins and leaves. Fucking sucks dick man. Never accepting invites ever again
---
&gt;Just don't run with these kinds of people, ideally you wanna run  dungeons with your guild to avoid shit like that...if it's happening in  your guild as well then you should probably look for a different guild. 
---
You tell people who want to reserve items to make guild runs, and then that you would not be part of a guild that does that. Why?
---
&gt; Then how could he perform better compared to people who get loot if he doesn't get loot? 
---
...by not standing in the fire, lol. That doesn‚Äôt require gear.
---
Is this being sold to the public: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5jiXmWAMs ?
---
You‚Äôre supposed to get a Drakestone of Shadow Wrath that adds another 20-21 damage.
---
It‚Äôs 2019.  Just need 3 lines of chat and a story.
---
I was never able to hack RP back in the day. I've never tried since, I suppose I could give it a go. Depends how seriously folks take it.
---
Pathetic.
---
Are there any others like this? This looks fantastic but I'd love to shake it up every now and then.
---
So you think people would leap at the chance to get them? That is the desired result I was hoping for!
---
Please voice all your dislikes online so the rest of us can know them.
---
Yes this is exactly what im talking about. The rain adds another layer of immersion for me.
---
Yeah, it dropped for me in BRD and I won the need roll out of 5 people :D
---
It's a free market. Tanking takes skill and is work. DPS is much more casual and fun. When I'm tired, I dont want to tank, I want to DPS.
---
So if someone is doing the work and wants something for it, I can either agree to it or wait until I find a tank that's happy to do it without.
---
Also you're talking about people who have reached 60 within a month, that's fairly hardcore. I imagine this will stop happening over time
---
I know, but one would understand that PUG raids include a LOT of people, some of which will need the same gear. It's a bit ridiculous to organise a group and go on a power trip about it.
---
I‚Äôve come across such elitist dickhead warriors. Druids are so chill
---
Mmo mouse and a foot pad if he has dexterity in his feet.  There are forums and I'd assume reddits dedicated to disabled gaming I've definitely seen one before but can't recall off the top of my head
---
bro are you threatening me with a popsicke
---
Ahh memories. I abandoned my very first toon back in 2005 at lvl 22. He was a bald human mage and I couldn't get over my regret of making him bald.
---
Just announce in general and trade that the guild favors loot to guildies on pug runs. They won‚Äôt be able to fill their 40 man because no one will run with them.
---
I hope you called the police immediately
---
I sell Robes of Winter night on my server and I see a variation of this all the time.
---
The buyer doesn't have a lot of money so they go out and farm the essences themselves.  Same for the felcloth, but both of these farm spots are camped to all hell at most reasonable hours.  Felwood in particular has a handful of cross-teaming professional farmers locking down spawns, so you spend most of your farming time being ganked.
---
If that same shadow priest had found a cash camp elsewhere and just grinded it out, they'd have had the money for the robe in a lot less time.
---
Your princess is in another castle.
---
They both rolled need on the item. How is that not equal chance at loot.
---
No, it just turns into a potential cost of being a ninja looter, not a penalty.
---
Thanks! For some reason I always missed this part of the website\^\^
---
60 bear tank representing! Rawr!
---
We can, involves more tab swiping.
---
I'm on Herod, I've made a decent chunk of gold making finished products.
---
Can someone explain DKP and Loot Council to me? Seeing it brought up a lot but no explanations.
---
Lmfao you're absolutely fuming
---
Is there a subreddit or discord server for the Bigglesworth Server?
---
Must be. My priest is still fairly low level, so mana goes so bloody quickly when every fucker needs healing!
---
Doesn't work like that. The game has always set you to AFK status if another key press isn't detected within a 5 minute span. Which will eventually lead to a DC.
---
You don't need permission to type the command /roll 100 and press enter. The raid leader doesn't have a choice in that.  How do you know they "allowed him to roll" with that very small snippet of chat? 
---
Your edit: Having gear doesn't make you good. He most likely would have died regardless of his gear.
---
How this affects community?
---
Yes, If you made people literally invincible for playing alliance some would switch. That does not make it a good idea.
---
Nice we 25'd it last night.
---
That is CHEAP on the scale of pay to win micro-transactions though. The current cost of changing your name in retail is $10 - and in Hearthstone alone, $10 is a pittance for even a small chance at decent cards. Can you imagine how many ninja looters would pop up just to capitalize? maybe $50 to ninja your way to a good set is super cheap for some people.
---
&gt; You must be triggered.
---
This was already played out in 2017 dude, at this point it just makes you sound like a grandma.
---
Hmmm wow! This is awesome
---
But I guess  i wont have the patience to do that.... And now i slowed down with leatherworking right now on 150 with lvl 32..
---
Well.. but I am high on skinning, but everything is green to skin in my questing zones
---
And him being in front of the boss was his choice and not being feared into it or someone pulling aggro and her turning briefly or the tank getting feared and turning her with it? All of those are valid reasons someone could die. Not saying they're the best, but things do happen. Regardless, if they didn't have specific loot rules that would eliminate them based on that (and 8 minutes in on p3 means they likely contributed a decent amount), they are 100% in the wrong to ignore the roll.
---
For leveling speed: voidwalker multi-dotting vs drain tanking with succubus? I'm using voidwalker at 27 right now and honestly not having many issues, but after 3-4 mobs I'll have to rest up or start draining life, which costs a lot of mana... then drain soul to proc the mana regen talent, so it takes ~3-4 more mobs to equalize again, which slows me down a bit. Plus, if I pull aggro from my voidwalker (pretty much guaranteed if I'm wanding), it puts me behind even further.
---
[This is my spec right now.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/35022030012) I wasn't planning on going into Fel Concentration (was going to go SM then into demonology), but I feel like I'll be running into more problems the higher level I get. VW's taunt is only decent for a couple levels after training the newest rank of it, plus I'll be doing more damage soon with Siphon Life and SM, making it harder for the VW to get aggro.
---
I've seen a ton of different guides and videos on the best talent path while leveling, but I'm hoping I can find some sort of consensus here. Should I respec, grab Fel Concentration and go for Dark Pact instead? I'm playing solo on a pvp server if that matters.
---
Had my brother make me some devilsaur leggings. With the cast bar add on, this is the ability shown.... didn‚Äôt show face on his screen and showed a regular icon
---
I prefer dkp and bonus rolls for a little fun, but eh, i'm used to full guild runs.
---
\&gt; Also, you can write /chatlog so your chat gets saved automatically to the disk, which can help find older whispers and stuff. 
---
What the fuck, I've literally spent way more time on WoW than I'd dare admit since 2004 WoW and didn't know this...
---
Spellstones remove all magical effects from you. Even buffs. Garbage IMO. Maybe in wPvP as a panic button in a desperate attempt to escape but most of the time they're just gonna mount up and catch you anyway. In TBC they're better because they're equipped in the wand slot. But the fact that they remove ALL magical effects really ruins spellstones for me. 
---
They also have no stats except for a 1% chance to crit.
---
Stance Dancing is what will seperate the A-tier tanks from the D-tier fools.
---
The main difference between something like retail and vanilla are how you do "rotations". In retail, you generally have two set rotations. One is for ST, one is for AoE. There are more buttons you have to hit in order, but you know what you have to do and it's hard as hell for the tank to actually lose threat. So you are free to do your rotations without thinking. 
---
Classic is more about only having 1-2 buttons in a dps rotations, BUT a ton of utility, and the ability to easily pull threat off the tank any time you want. That's how the game is designed on purpose, and if you come in with a mindset of pushing your rotation as hard as possible, it won't go well.
---
The best that can be done is trying to explain that to the people that will listen, and removing the people that won't. If everyone refuses to play with the people who won't do right, then they will have no choice but to either start listening and playing right, or quit. 
---
We just have to be careful about how we approach this, because I see a TON of Mage hate and Spellcleave hate in general. People literally want to remove Spellcleave from the game and never interact with Mages anyway. The problem is the players and they need to be dealt with individually. Spellcleaves are fine on their own, and if you don't want to deal with Mages under any circumstances anyway, why would you want to destroy their Spellcleaves to begin with? Some of the people complaining lack any common sense either.
---
/cries in poor
---
How was it back then? Did noone realize the mage aoe power?
---
I do 3month sub but I'll stay until TBC is released again, hated it way back when, don't want to be replacing my epics with greens again
---
The emerald whelp let me skip most of stv by leveling on them until I got it. That's the reason I wanted to hit these early, so I could level up while farming them.
---
Congrats on being the 1000th person to post this!
---
Is this a real weapon. Because it look cool. I wanna beat my pal in a duel with it whatever it is
---
Low level dungeons were fine, but now I keep coming across selfish and petty people... Did mara where we had 2 "dps" warriors. High level one refused to tank, so the low level one left because "he should tank he is higher level". Than other guy left because we were taking to long doing quests outside the dungeon...
---
You should play with her!!!! or just stick to questing and joining non aoe groups, which is what my plan is for the rest of the way to 60
---
Yeah but if this man died early and literally just laid dead all fight then don‚Äôt send loot to carries. Not saying did OP, but if you did, do you really think you deserve trophies for not placing? Classic is all about politics. It‚Äôs not a ninja. It‚Äôs just you not being in the guild. If your guild isn‚Äôt clearing content time to look for one that is.
---
Which one did I suggest do you think is to powerful? How could we weaken it slightly to still encourage players to choose the outnumbered faction without making it OP in your mind?
---
If you use that buff, how long does it last?
---
and if you swap weapons, does the staff stay? (if it does you should use it for the buff but find something other than stam lol)
---
Gamestop Orgrimmar Manager speaking here, huh?
---
One of the designers, his face also shows up as one of the macro icons!
---
&gt; By simply being present you contributed to the fight.
---
That is not true at all, not even close. OP died by standing in the fire during Ony.
---
&gt; my ex
---
A minute of silence for you.
---
Until Predatory strikes is fixed during quick shifting, Feral will suffer. The hidden buff only applying once every 2nd shift has a -90atk pwr effect
---
Thats why its the dps job to slow down
---
Checkout the Addon atlasloot classic, gives you a rough idea of level ranges

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da0cp8/since_we_gain_gold_exponentially_while_leveling/). 
---
Pointing out stuff like this is good. It will make people less likely to pug with them. Which in teen may cause them to be more fair if they don‚Äôt have a full raid team.
---
Bald is beautiful.
---
My keyboard doesn‚Äôt have a print screen key, but I just use windows snipping tool.
---
Its not worth it on my server atm.
---
I mean, I'm not there for charity. I'm there for a chance at loot. And raiding experience of course.
---
I would think a DPS warrior has one one of the hardest times finding a group. Warriors willing to tank are in high demand and don't want to share loot with you. 
---
All classes have their perks.  Just remember that if you can tank you will be asked to tank, and if you can heal, you will be asked to heal. 
---
Mages have the best quality of life, but I would be reluctant to roll one myself because of how populated they are.
---
OH the vanquishers sword for the attack power.  Also assuming you are or are going sword spec.  
---
I‚Äôm still using that stupid thing in my OH at 60 üòÇüò≠
---
Yep.  I'd be curious to know what was communicated prior to.  What was the loot rules...
---
No approval needed to /roll. Whats stopping Ricky or Ninjutix /rolling 5x NOTHING
---
This is the reason I've mained a druid for 14 years.  The best part is that so many people still don't know what's coming.  I like to imagine the look on their faces.
---
I honestly can't tell if you're joking or if you didn't actually look at the image
---
Yeah definitely a pass/greed roll item for mages
---
Apparently we only have to follow the rules in game. Following rules on the subreddit is discouraged.
---
yea some of those people are so impatient its ridiculous like chill man, its going to take about 8 days play time to hit 60 anyway.
---
I havent had headgear drop for me, I'm lvl 20 right now and I know me, I'd have to reroll. It would bug me, and I'm on an rp server, so various events would have me taking my head piece off, and then there we are, an exposed Frankenstein! Lol. I hope you can find an awesome head piece and that you dont have to reroll!!
---
Try NugRunning, it will show a bar for each dot/hot/cc that you cast and count it down. You can't click it, and not entirely sure about cc breaking but it allows me to see when I may need to redo cc.
---
Im also a Lock on Westfall. Hope you can find a solution but i agree a macro explanation seems like a good idea.
---
You don‚Äôt. The people complaining on Reddit are just really loud. But they‚Äôre not good. 
---
I know it‚Äôs not the exact same comparison, but I just finished healing UBRS as a ret paladin with ‚Äúokay‚Äù healing gear (still about 4 green level 30-40 items). I was still healing on par with our level 60, full pre-raid bis healer. 
---
The spec you‚Äôre using, and the items you‚Äôre using are still much **much** less important relative to playing correctly.
---
Even with investing gold into professions and slowly enjoying yourself leveling there is really no excuse not to have the needed gold at 40. They make it so easy.
---
This. Personal loot is for retail. In classic we pay for carries!
---
Obviously you are guilty of these shameful practices, with how apologetic you are to ninja looters and fiends. Very "by the books" he? We were just following orders?
---
Can we get a sticky explaining this icon?
---
He will make his own group, get something he wants taken by someone who doesn't need it, and start doing his own reserves.
---
Its a never ending cycle.
---
Just hit 30 as Alliance. I want to get to 40 as soon as possible. Since I play on a PvP server, where would you recommend? I don't mind the occasional gank but don't want to waste too much time.
---
&gt;Just don't be a dick
---
"Im not following you"
---
-Hunters
---
Yup and "you must be triggered" is incredibly forced not to mention beyond overused. Not sure why they can't both be true.
---
You can't see enemy buffs in classic.   Addons can only track buffs they saw applies via the combat log
---
As a warlock player, and in think other warlocks may agree, we never blame the healer. We know what we are getting into when we life tap. 
---
Always blame the tank though. Why cant he get agro from my 6 dot targets though?
---
Bad tank
---
That's a false narrative. It happens far more often than not.
---
Yeah got frustrated tonight and bought a Combatant's Sword on AH for far too much. Should carry me through to whirlwind axe, though.
---
LC is great on paper, but it's usually just another term for "GM and officers take whatever they want and give the remains to others"... personally, never again.
---
Thats my boi sammy... every good adventure has a sam sidekick... thus wow has one 2
---
It's as boring or even more so in my opinion.  
---
What you do is immolate + coa -&gt; corruption -&gt; wand until 30, at which point you do immolate + coa -&gt; corruption -&gt; drain life.  
---
That's your rotation. Forever and ever. If you pull an extra mob you can do the same on him or fear him away.  
---
As a mage, you have the option to aoe grind with blizzard or arcane explosion from time to time or you can switch between fire and frost.  
---
At the end of the day, all classes just press the same sequence of buttons, it's the same in retail, too.
---
Is 50% off to powerful, what about 25%, what about 10%.
---
Get a new pet.
---
I subbed the day after lunch and posting in Reddit so you're wrong.
---
Just dodge more!
---
Correct for the reason you stated
---
Generally speaking, on my server it‚Äôs custom to all need on BoE epics due to the inherent value of them. That said, the Krol blade is BiS and I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if someone who actually needed took it and equipped it.
---
It‚Äôs only ninja looting in my perspective if the rogue needed it, didn‚Äôt equip it, proceeded to sell it on auction.
---
The one thing I still have a problem with is that you even explained this to the GM and they completely ignored it.
---
He can work a foot pedal. I floated that idea his way and we're looking in to that. Maybe bind shift to his foot pedal essentially doubling the buttons on his mouse.
---
90 gold at 40 is a big deal. 25 percent seems reasonable though
---
feels bad! Lets take this to the top to make them regret the ninja!
---
I see Kromcrush listed as "Full" but I haven't waited in a queue in a few weeks. I get on around 1900 ST every night so you'd think I would get stuck in one, but nope.
---
You must be playing some awful hunters....
---
We bring PuGs to MC and we absolutely give them equal chance at loot because reputation matters and we appreciate them filling the empty slot. We also recruit. We reserve some things up front like bindings, but everything else is on the level. My hope is that this guild gets shitlisted and I‚Äôm glad that OP is throwing out a PSA with proof. This is not how people should operate.
---
Every few hours I see someone mention Asmon or something, otherwise it's been identical to my experience in Herod and Whitemane. The few times I've had a group camp me or something I'm trying to do has been from guilds on Herod.
---
Check out a website called [allyroute](https://allyroute.com/index.php?page=01-06d). It's been helping me out a lot, it gives you a list of quest and what order to do them in.
---
It's not an addon or anything just a website. Its vague enough where it doesn't like pinpoint/railroad you.
---
Try reloading your ui through the addons menu
---
Ill check that out. Thanks.
---
Is a dick mage a mage with a dickish personality or one who has spent a lifetime studying the arcane knowledge of dicks?
---
That's probably so fun to run around with basically god mode on.
---
In PuGs I don't recall seeing hardly any gear on reserve in Vanilla, gear on reserve was always a guild premade thing or a group of friends thing.
---
Classic does seem extremely bad for in my experience, ended up in a group where the leader kept kicking people or not taking certain classes because they wanted to reserve the 2 swords from ZF. Made finding members take forever.
---
I was ruined on dkp as a whole with a guild I was part of during WotLK. It was a closed bid system. Everything was initially on the up and up, dkp was kept on the guild‚Äôs website and updated per raid. But then it was taken off the website and only certain officers had access to to the numbers. 
---
So inevitably the group in charge of dkp seemed to have unlimited amounts of dkp. They‚Äôd constantly get gear and anyone who questioned was told it was because they never missed a raid. But no one ever really missed a raid. Guild eventually split over it. 
---
Loot council was probably the best system I used, but I think it was because the leadership in that guild was better. I think good, fair leadership is the most important parts of the loot systems though.
---
I killed SOOOOOOO many alliance in front of ZF last night.  I just LOVE world PVP.
---
Might even be worth just friending a few DPS wars who are good and bring them along to every dungeon. At least once they take a piece of gear they won‚Äôt be rolling against you for it ever again.
---
On Alliance, no other good class to give it to buddy. 
---
Arms warrior is meme spec, so is 2h fury. Both majorly outclassed by 1h fury.
---
It depends on a lot of factors. What was originally posted or said. OP said their healing was low cuz they died early. It then comes down to how many pulls did they do. If they did 5 pulls and 1 healer died every pull and did little healing, I also wouldn't allow him to get loot, over a guildie or other pug who actually performed their duties. We are basing this off 1 screen shot. Did the Raid leader whisper op and ask to pick up performance in a wipe. There's so much missing information.
---
Why are you telling everyone?
---
That is disgusting.
---
Are you skinning? Or what profession are you trying to sell mats for? Typically most low-mid level mats are going to go for vendor value as the market is super flooded.

Tell us the truth OP!
---
About the same in pve. Minor differences.

PVP though i think it's where the difference lies.

Warlocks have a much higher skill ceiling.

Mages have a lot more movement and escape options though. Not even close. 
---
But with locks my fight style in PVP changes a lot by what class im fighting. Different curses. When i fear. Should i start with seduction? Syphon and out last or nuke to stomp fast?
---
[This is not a guide.just what i do.]
---
Rogues i seduce and get room then dot. Then go for kill and fear. 
---
Mages curse of tongues. fear then shadow bolt until dead. 
---
Wars seduction. Run away. Curse of exhaustion.  Unload everything using fear as necessary.
---
Pally no one has done for that. 
---
Then you still have your heavy hitters.  Death coils etc.
---
Mage was just pretty much the same every fight except druids and hunters. 
---
WPVP is what i am referring to. 
---
Overall PVE wise mage is stronger. 
---
But WPVP wise lock is just funner for me.
---
Yes it does
---
Nothing matters and we're all gonna die.

Typically when an epic drops , there‚Äôs sort of an unwritten rule that everyone needs on it. Usually a group can be nice and actually talk it out, but I doubt it. Not many people are aware of this, so they press greed thinking everyone else will follow suit. The reason everyone hits need is because usually people will ninja epics regardless and with everyone in partying hitting need it pretty much turns it into a greed roll. If this makes sense.
---
fits my opinion
---
I said free/discounted. At what point is it not too powerful but would still help with imbalance?
---
&gt; CC, disrupt or dispell are not needed
---
That's how I know you have no clue of what you're talking about. I guess I should just let people sit in polymorph? Don't dispel the renew on the healer mob? Don't interrupt heals? Don't CC the mobs that aren't grouped?
---
Yeah you're clueless and talking out of your ass.
---
So basicly you are bad at timemanagement. Weird flex but Oke
---
Correct. Warrior tanks need to be hit to generate rage needed to generate threat.
---
weird flex but ok
---
I get paid on the 30th and not got any spare money untill then so... My weekend is going to be a quiet one... Booo
---
It‚Äôs not a false narrative, it‚Äôs a rare one.
---
There's several addons that will do this for you automatically. LetMeCast is one, DismountMe is another.
---
Dude farming stuff like the demonic runes on my server is already a pain, without layering it would be hell on earth on Whitemane
---
You're just barely below what I had at that level. You're gonna make it just fine. Since you're likely already honored with your home faction it's only 90g. You start getting crazy amounts of money at 38+. STV, Badlands, Arathi, all give a lot of gold. I made most of my cash by selling silk stacks.
---
get tailoring to 300 and craft robe of the void then drop it and get engineering
---
&gt; How could we weaken it slightly to still encourage players to choose the outnumbered faction without making it OP in your mind?
---
delet this
---
Modern dmg meters don't include overhealing. There is a specific tab for it, but it's not included in the general healing done.
---
How do you figure out which addon is causing issues? I have some error text come up every time I log in and I‚Äôve tried disabling and reenabling addons but can‚Äôt seem to find the culprit.
---
First off, Bear Down baby. Go Bears! Kings of the north!
---
Second, bear tanks are great but they don't have many gear options and suffer from a gap in gear between MC and AQ.
---
on warriors, use it if they would die if you didn't use it, or use it if it's a scenario where they are so far ahead on threat that they won't need the rage they aren't getting to keep threat. which is hard to judge. 
---
But as a rule of thumb, just never use it on the pull. Thats when they need the rage the most
---
I feel like Paladins and Wars use different items, do they not?
---
the post got removed :(
---
It‚Äôs an mmo. It isnt supposed to be a game for solo players
---
Do you have sword talents? If so just use swords and always put faster one in offhand.
---
Nice, I had that staff in vanilla on my priest.
---
Good luck spellstoning with that. :D
---
You can use it if they are low health and you need it to buy time to get a heal off. However at the start of a fight they need to get hit so they can generate rage and be able to hold threat.
---
that's why twinks exist, easier to cap on gear.
---
Layering isn't as big of a deal as people are making it out to be, change my mind.
---
I think divine spirit is a must have for priests, if you play on ally side priests might need to AOE heal a bit more (since the lack of shamys / the badass single target heals of pallys) so holy reach might be a consideration
---
Go arms warrior and respec to protection at 57
---
&gt;These ‚Äòreserves‚Äô I am seeing for SM &amp; any 5 man really are just laughable.
---
Esp since they will usually replaced in a few levels anyways.
---
Skill for Ret lul 
---
Seal
---
Judge
---
White hits while you watch your Netflix series
---
&gt; If you bring PuGs then you gotta give them equal chance at the loot.
---
Or at the very least, make it loud and clear that certain items are on reserve, and make efforts to be sure everyone knows it BEFORE the raid starts, preferably when you're building the PUG.
---
Well, more often than not when I start owning the rog/war that decided to try gank me they inevitably run away. CoEx helped secure so many kills. I put 2 points in the improved
---
You also realize that Method was trying to recruit some of these guilds that got the Classic firsts? They just wanted the extra publicity for themselves. But I didn't realize you were on their level. 
---
Not arguing that 15 year old content is necessarily difficult, but most regular guilds still fuck up a good amount in MC/Ony.
---
Hard disagree. Giving loot to someone who kept dying and wasn't very good may suck, but if it's an open roll system and they roll high that's just how it goes. No such thing as performance based loot systems in PuG's. I used to run ICC25 PuGs in WOTLK with my 10 man guild and if a shitty PuG won the roll then we dealt with it and moved on.
---
yes, its shit.
---
So the mount could cost 100 g, and the xp bonus reduced to 0%
---
It's easy enough to check for yourself in the wild, just cast drain life and the amount you heal each tick is the DPS. The wands is just on the tooltip.
---
I'm currently 55 and used drain tank method with succubus.  I rarely have to drink and eat and only do that when I'm fighting higher level mobs in quick succession.  You will be tanking anyway, why not do more damage and gain life in the process.  With the VW you will be killing slower and have to throttle your damage so you don't steal agro. 
---
At your level I was still using imp.  Drain tanking really started to shine in the late 30s if I remember.  Just search for Dive's guide on it.  Really all you need to know.
---
That is correct, PW:S is a desperate solution so the tank doesn't die.
---
Your best candidates are casters that pull aggro, so with the AoE MageMania, you know what to do.
---
You skip the last two talents in holy. 
---
No lightwell or Angel form when you die. This is so you can get divine spirit in disc witch scales with your healing (5/5 in that holy talent) the rest is common sense and sort of optional if you ask me.
---
I tried not to rank up renew even though it‚Äôs probably your best bet when it comes to keeping your tank alive In crazy situations. 
---
BUT, I‚Äôm experienced and am healing quick BRD runs with shadow atm. SOO when I respec (since I don‚Äôt want to try and heal anything harder with shadow spec) I‚Äôm actually going to get the Angel form and lightwell that it leads too. 
---
I speced into holy once and got divine spirit accompanied by good healing gear and I couldn‚Äôt even down rank enough to not over heal! Witch made me think... when dose the party wipe because of my own errors?
---
30% of me just looking away and getting distracted for 5 sec. witch leads to a wipe. 
---
69% is tank being an idiot and not letting anyone including casters regen mana/ me not wanting to pop mana pots for a normal mob pull...
---
1% of the time we wipe is cause I‚Äôm not good enough/ heals not healing enough. (Usually BRS)
---
That music is dogshit
---
report them, people are getting banned for abusing masterlooter since wotlk
---
Maybe that‚Äôs the surprise.
---
Sorry man, that really sucks. I hope it drops for you again soon. You have to put them on blast because of they do this to you, they‚Äôll do it to others.
---
&gt; I suppose an open bid dkp system could work, but if two players don't like each other and one knows the other really wants something, they might bid up the price just so the other person has to pay a ransom, and that creates drama.
---
In every case someone's brought that up in my experiance, it's an excuse for being bad at rationing your DKP and spending it all on one item.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8lh1c/is_it_acceptable_to_roll_on_an_epic_boe_drop_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Large discussion on the topic a few days ago. Opinions were certainly controversial, but it seems the most support went to all rolling need. Top few comments in that thread explain the logic behind it.
---
Except as ele shaman you're going to want to use tranquil air totem to make the mobs not try to eat your face, which excludes windfury totem.
---
Only reason as to why warriors are so good is because of block and parry. Parry negates a hit of damage entirely, in addition to dodge (and yes, ferals usually have higher amounts of dodge to counter this), but with Shield Block blocking two attacks, you can keep it up almost all the time, as long as the boss doesn't enrage or go into a frenzy. Block is so strong because you effectively cancel critical hits, which hurt a whole lot and applies pressure to your healers and perhaps even death for yourself.
---
oh so itsn ot just thousands of solo players playing the same game together ?
---
Typically a raid leader will tell PuGs that they can't roll on tier pieces, but they usually tell you so beforehand.
---
You seem like you know your stuff. So i ended up making a combat rouge and i keep him in pretty relevent gear, weps are at most 2-3 lvls out and armor is usually some of the best that can be crafted or bought for the lvl (19 atm). And he just flat SUCKS. I can hardly 1v1 mobs my level and often lose. Any idea what im doing wrong? I generall sinister strike 3X, get the att speed buff, then stack sinister again and if i happen to crit often/on the execute move i win. If i dont i lose. All gear is either crafted by main or bought on AH with +armor improvement.
---
Maybe, if the mods want me to remove it I'll understand, but given similar info and threads existing without being removed I'll let it stand for the sheer fact that he's still spamming his macro about my guild
---
Ok then. Did you sell all your TVs and cancel cable as well?
---
Warcraft is entertainment, don‚Äôt get stuff all twisted.
---
You can open a ticket for this, as long as he said loot rolls are /roll and you did /roll this is an obvious case of ninjaloot and blizzard will remove it from then and give it to you as well as give them a warning. This is against ToS you can actually make it a thing.
---
No Im not
---
Yeah, and when only 2 people on the server have it, they kind of have the ability to charge what they want, Retard.
---
You're going to need to bounce back and forth between both, maybe even some redridge mountains.
---
inb4 downvotes, but
---
sadly the concensus here seems to be "all need on any valuable BoE drop". They never actually say what the value should be for it to qualify for an "all need" drop. So imho it's very stupid as "needing" something to sell it is the literal definition of "greed".
---
So imo:
---
1) the 2 needers are ninjas, the other 3 got rekt and will from now on probably also Need on any BoE
---
2) this is as it should be, but they should demand the rogue to equip it in front of them, else he's a ninja
---
3) the 2 mages should press need, the rest greed. demand  the winner to equip it, else he's a ninja.
---
Just loot it, then log with ninja speed
---
Add-ons can do all sorts of thing. Primarily though, think of them as ways to either augment your gameplay, by adding a feature that WoW or Classic WoW doesn't support, or QoL upgrades. 
---
I use RealMobHealth, Questie, Spy, Auctionator, Bagnon, Atlas loot, just for a few examples. As you can see, most of those are simply QoL and don't change the actual game, but some add-ons like Spy and Questie add a functionality to the game that doesn't normally exist, so they can be classified differently.
---
Lol I did the same when I replaced my loyal raptor for [this bad boy.](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=3619/ghost-saber)
---
On cell phone, so a build is difficult to show, but my build is very close.  I opted for improved imp and destructive reach over cataclysm, and instead of fel concentration I got amplify curse, maxed out the %hit for affliction spells, and have the points in improved soul drain (I'm doing a good job in groups of sniping last hits with shadowbolts--you can soul drain while the shadowbolt is in flight and you'll get a shard and the spirit proc!)
---
I recognize this isn't the most efficient spec in terms of Mana use or for raiding, but for questing and instances it serves me well, and I have a regular dungeon healer who doesn't mind giving me renews (while I bandage.)
---
At 46 I was averaging around 200dps in dungeons, but that's with ~160 +shadow damage.  I'm 53 now with ~195 +shadow damage and am pulling between 260-340 (aggro permitting).
---
Isn't that Klinda's guild? Was their tabard pink? I'm surprised (no puns intended) they'd do this. They seem like a good bunch of chaps.
---
Your journey ended when the Scourge came then it began again at level 1 as a forsaken.
---
Then it ended when you died but then it started again when you hit 60!!
---
I can't wait to see how many times you can live and die and live again!!!
---
You suck, period.
---
Oh, no, I'm not saying what the guild did was right. He should have gotten that loot. I'm just saying, according to guild members, that's what happened.  
---
(If he did die seconds into the fight for mind blasting and pulling aggro, however, I would agree to not getting loot. As a priest, you know mind blast pulls a ridiculous amount of threat.)
---
thats where the 5 point is switched. from 15% fero bite to 15% threat.
---
Deadwind Pass Ogres is the best farm for priests afaik
---
Exactly!
---
lmfao, reddit and their delusions
---
I played both warlock and mage back then, now I'm leveling a warlock. While mage felt dynamic, always on the move, warlock feels just so powerful... So the fun in mage came from always having terrain in mind (or PoM cool down, depending on spec). In warlock it was the sheer availability of tools.
---
Almost done with 41-50, 51-60 is looking real intimidating, but running BRD until I'm blue in the face, as well as Sunken Temple, Strath, and Scholo is going to make it no so cancer.
---
Hopefully my dungeon group can hold it together long enough!
---
Look at the screen shot...
---
They took our jeeeeeeebs!
---
I heard they recently reworked the worsen model.  Updated its appearance and movement animation.
---
I haven‚Äôt touched retail since Classic launched, so I can‚Äôt attest to it though.  And it‚Äôs unlikely that I will until the next expansion hits.
---
I'm alliance on the same server and it feels pretty balanced to me, sure there are more hordes but it isn't that bad. The 60's guardian lower levels is an issue though, just yesterday a 60 orc rogue was ganking me for over an hour because I killed someone.
---
Or grabbing the egg I guess anyone can do that in a raid or solo
---
Wow, i did ! :o
---
Wow...
---
I hope you charge interest on those loans!
---
Paladins level as ret, so same gear as warr.  They heal as ret too, unless theyre funded or exclusively in parties.
---
RotV is total shit compared to the priest robe and mage robe. It‚Äôs not really worth going out of your way for it.
---
 its 360% in game right now. when it was originally added doesn't really matter in this case.
---
13 days, hit 60 a week sgo.
---
Go into your server discord or, if there are subreddits, that too and blast these ninja organizations until they dissolve. Call out the leaders in particular.
---
Im confused on this Ninja looting thing. (New player lvl 35). Shouldnt it just be if you can equip it RIGHT NOW* on your current character you need it, and if not you greed it? Thats how i have been doing it anyway...
---
*Added in later: Or if its part of a set bonus you will use when you get the other piece(s).
---
I started as a druid back in the TBC days. It's a class that's easy to pick up but hard to master. A great choice.
---
I.... I... didn't know it was possible to hate gnomes anymore than I did as Horde.
---
The green drop example is not valid in my point of view, we're talking about 400G vs a 10S drop
---
They offer some QoL improvements over the default UI. I use quite a few. I really like Bagnon and Bankstack. Bagnon combines all of your bag space into one big bag. Bankstack will sort your bags and put vendor junk at the back. Wide Quest Log is also nice. Bartender is a must for me as well. It lets you customize where your action bars go. 
---
The Twitch app has a section for "mods" as they call them. You can browse and install them.
---
10/10 gifted from a Troll man
---
Aight.
---
Yes. Undead is fine. 
---
You shouldn't go to tauren area for leveling. No trainer.
---
My sex life is the same but I‚Äôve saved a nice little chunk of money since classic came out because I don‚Äôt want to go out for drinks as often.
---
I wanna slap people like you with a mousepad
---
Why stop doing something you enjoy?
---
Sounds like you got a shit ton of Leather drops?
---
You forgot to mention step 5 where your guild then ninja loots priest gear away from pug healers.
---
This right here is a big factor as well.
---
where did y find all those sir
---
go check the definition of mature please, cause you're just throwing up random words atm. The biggest upgrade anyone can get atm is the 100% mount, and few have it. So its totally unrealistic to expect people just passing you 20%+ of that sum just to be kind. 
---
Also you're the one calling people kids cause you disagree with their pov, nice grown up man rofl. And lastly reality will support my view, there will be other similar thread with people losing their bis boe to people needing the item.
---
Your secret is safe with me and anyone else who bothers to scroll this far down into the comments.
---
Both, but mostly QoL.
---
Some examples of functions from addons I use:  
---
Show all of my bags as one big bag  
---
Tell me what vendors will pay for items  
---
Make it easier to buy/sell stuff on AH  
---
Show me enemy cast bars  
---

---
That truly blows. That's a nice item, too. Sorry :(
---
I think it's because he's exalted with Gadgetzan.
---
What level are you? Have you tried running dungeons? If you're starved for cash I'd grab skinning and just vendor the leather you skin. It's a really easy way to make money.
---
Add-ons can track where mining nodes are on the map, how your chatbox looks and behaves, keep track of your ability cooldowns, show you what loot is in a specific dungeon before you even go there, change your ui look, etc. Can it detract from your experience? Yes. But you choose what you want or don't want. Many of them are very integral to people. 
---
You can use the twitch app [here](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads) to download addons and they will automatically be put in the correct folder of your wow installation. (Make sure you're searching by WoW Classic, not any other version). Other wise you download an add-on that will come in a zip file that you place in C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns typically. I'm sure others can explain it better, but I can help out more if you need it.
---
I've seen so few druids, yesterday was the first time my priest received an innervate. Did MC pug last weekend that had 1 druid (tank).
---
People worry far too much about optimal, come on, the hard core guys cleared MC with half the raid not even 60, does anyone really think you need super optimal stuff to clear content? 
---
Just do your best and have fun regardless what you play, there's people out there who understand you don't have to spellcleave everything
---
Ok I respec an give similar build a try! What's your rotation?
---
If they didn't want anyone rolling why even post it in chat instead of straight giving it to their own guy. If they're at all organized even a little bit they should know what guildies need what going into the raid. 
---
As for not contributing, we don't know why they died, just that they died.  "Git gud" mentality doesn't always work for telling someone to not die when other players can get you killed in boss fights.
---
It's main hand only though. :D
---
That's why /roll is better. No problem, no human decision, no injustice, no ninja nothing.
---
Seriously? Phase 2 is going to introduce ranking and PvP rewards, but not battlegrounds. You can't come up with any reason that having people multibotting characters is going to negatively impact other players? I have to give you specific examples of people getting owned 1v5 because somebody paid more money than them? That's not a problem? 
---
Then there's the whole RP side. Seeing somebody walk around with programs controling their additional account for them, doesn't exactly scream world immersion.
---
They freaking should be. Every warrior thinks 2h/dual wield tanking is the new meta.
---
Maybe it is if you're good, or you're a streamer with a cavalcade of ~~brainless fuckups~~ fans propping you up. But pro tip: Most of you suck. You don't know how to pull, you don't know how to rotate on packs, you don't use your CD's properly, and then when you try to chase the mobs around you end up getting stunned and crit because you honestly have no idea how the game works. 
---
You want to try DPS tanking warriors? Fine, but bring a god damn shield for when it doesn't work out.
---
I who'd both characters and both are priest. So OP is very likely in the right here.
---
That's short sighted, you're playing a DPS class and you want to switch to tanking / healing just so you can get gear easier?  That's an entire gameplay switch
---
the only place there is a base for argument is when master looter is abused  
---
everywhere else, it's the wild west as usual
---
I once had the perfect group in that Caverns of Time dungeon where you go into Stormwind(?) to fight off undead and your character is disguised as Alliance unless they're shape-shifted. We had 4 druids and a hunter.
---
I was the tank as a bear, but we also had an owl, a tree, and a cat as well. The hunter also had their pet, so we come waltzing into this human town like some ridiculous plague fighting squad of 5 animals and a "human."
---
It wasn't the most "efficient" for gear diversity, but it was a pretty good time anyways and we managed to wipe out the scourge without too much trouble. üß°üñ§üíö
---
any decent mage will know to only use instants if there is a fel hunter in play lol, ice block removes all dots and can be used twice if all CDs are up when the fight starts... mage gots tools bruh lol
---
It's super easy finding raiding guilds today. If you join a guild lead by assholes for assholes, just leave. There are SO MANY guilds made by and for NORMAL people. Just join one of them, it has never been easier to avoid fucktards like those in the screenshot.
---
All of the taunt cooldown timings are wrong.
---
Should be using more abilities than spam sunder.
---
Sometimes it's just poor tanking and not always DPS.
---
Bwahahaha!
---
Why are you training every skill? I'm only taking the necessities. Was easy rich enough for mount at 40.
---
"Oh btw, that gold was on a 10% interest. Daily"
---
Tribal seems to have some good healing gear. I don't know for sure about shamans or their pre bis. I went tribal for the devilsaur stuff. It seems like that is really good for almost all dps. I imagine though that most LW will go Tribal so there is more competition.
---
It's measuring proportions. But it doesn't matter anyway because it's a fucking cartoon and isn't required to be realistic.
---
Never understand how people think they can get away with this kind of crap.  If you have a good thing going, clearing content, good group of players, is it really worth it to throw it away because you want more gear for yourself?
---
I purchased Iceborne, but haven't even reached the Tigrex fight yet because Classic has its claws in me so deeply. And Tigrex was one of my favourite fights in older games.
---
I have not had any issues. Maybe uninstall and re install.
---
I am getting it off the wow classic section in twitch.
---
I bring this up because some sites have old versions. Happened to me with auctioneer.
---
Surprise
---
Can confirm am oom kitten
---
God I hate HS Rexxar skin. Hopefully his 1000 win portrait will not have this stupid ass bow.
---
Mark skulls, keep shouts up, sunder or revenge anything that starts running away.
---
Make sure if mages are pulling threat that they run TO you and not away from you.
---
Not saying you don't know what you're doing or anything, I'm still pretty new to warrior tanking, but I have been successful by doing these things.
---
I would prefer to learn tanking with the disadvantage of using a 1h for threat so it will help me build good habits.
---
Git Gud
---
How are crushing blows procd as the boss? Is  similar to crits?
---
[The faction wars explained.](https://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/)
---
Hell yeah, haven't had a bad group yet here.
---
In the dungeons it feels absolutely dogshit though, I did a mara run yesterday and I felt like I oom before I can even blink, and a lot of shit immune to nature :( Grinding mobs/ questing is a blast however. I do have that 4k mana pool at 48 as well.
---
Why do I read this with trolls accent, man?
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to WoW in general, I hear about ‚Äúninja looting‚Äù all the time, can someone explain what it is, and why it‚Äôs frowned upon please
---
Our kill of Mythic Archimonde in Warlords ended in a similar way. He died with only our bear tank standing for the last few seconds hoping the dots would finish him.
---
Tauren are the only Horde race I like and respect. The only race I play if I ever roll Horde.
---
First time I hear of a system like that. Only major flaw is that if you‚Äôre unlucky for the drops of certain items, then they will be sold at a huge price price, compared to other. It also strongly encourages people to hoard dkp for special items and forego other actual upgrades. 
---
Example. You have 6 dps‚Äôs whom all want ‚Äúx insane weapon‚Äù. One realist that he is behind everyone else and will never get enough to claim it. The others might. So now you have one person whom just grabs everything as almost no cost, while the 5 others passes on upgrade because they don‚Äôt want to loose their claim (or chance for claim) or the ‚Äúx insane weapon‚Äù. 
---
What if there now drops items there are legit upgrades for the other 5, but no one wants to buy it because they then looses out to the next 4 to get the insane items. 
---
This was what there happen with war glaives from illadan...
---
Respecing to get shadow form will net you more DPS than keeping the 5/5 for wand, which should be your next 5 points anyhow. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt look at your build right now because I‚Äôm at work, but I‚Äôll try to remember once I get off to look. Regarding Shadow Focus, absolutely max it out‚Ä¶having your big fatty MB resist sucks.
---
Yeah it absolutely does. It does it slowly, one spot at a time, but bagnon sort works.
---
Yes. The AH is extremely volatile right now, and you're a low enough level that anything you can obtain would have been present on the AH three weeks ago. You'll make more money from doing quests/dungeons and selling the greens/blues than you would playing the AH.
---
Herbalism and alchemy
---
I ended up not playing classic wow or following the scene very much (except to lightly troll here and there) so you'll have to let me know if I was or wasn't right since google has been useless about the topic.
---
I do! I'll check that out
---
Terrible policy.  If someone isn‚Äôt contributing, warn them and kick them.  It they‚Äôre present for the boss kill, they deserve a shot at loot.
---
Plus some deaths aren‚Äôt their fault.
---
Im a Tauren Druid on Skeram and I main feral.  I have tanked all of MC and MT Ony already.  I did OT Rag because I was having a hard time hitting Rag in my FR gear, but I tanked everything besides that.  There was a lot of DISCUSSION before classic launched about what druids would be able to do, etc.
---
But that doesnt matter anymore because I literally tanked MC and Rag so I know it works.  Druids are doing fine.
---
Yes I can imagine this. But do you think it is possible that having 2 points in the increased affliction range would have similar results and behing more versatile ? Because here it's 3 points to sometimes secure kills.
---
&gt; fixed-cost dkp was best loot system I've ever worked with.
---
keeping up with DKP is cancer for those doing it tho.
---
I think they all started in: BS, SG, .Org, Badlands
---
That's reddit in a nutshell
---
Yep. Don't use it, except if it's the only way to save his life.
---
run the program using wine lol it can work
---
You're more than welcome to use Shield on a tank. Just wait til aggro is established, and never do it on the initial pull.  
---
Just makes everyone's life harder, especially the tank.
---
I just got my Feline Mantle about and hour ago. Happy days!
---
Why is more layers more drops? 
---
If there was no layering people would go to instances wich are kind of "layered" for every group that enters them. In fact I think that would cause even more drops as if people are farming solo.
---
In my opinion the only effect of layering is that the method how items and gold are generated is shifted a from instances to open world farming, at least a little bit.
---
There are a few things that don't pay of in instances: fishing and herbalism. Every other profession is done better running instances (farming them)
---
Genuinely asking, in what way is that better? BGs can't get here soon enough, imo. 
---
I love world pvp and all, but 99/100 it's a ?? raising their professions that they neglected while leveling ganking people trying to complete quests.
---
Slam also isn't normised.
---
They do. The agreement of loot rules in chat kinda acts as enough of a social contract that GMs will step in during disputes. Or at least they did in vanilla
---
Questing, even in this bracket, is always the fastest way to level.
---
However if you are getting ganked at all the math immediately switches to dungeons being favorable due to the consistency.
---
God I wish that were me.
---
There‚Äôs guilds raiding at all hours of the day.
---
TL;DR 
---
Changed layer
---
But did he say what loot rules were
---
Lmao. For real this addon made me eyeroll super hard.
---
Basically when you win an item you're not allowed to roll against people who havent won an item yet.
---
Sounds like he really, really wants Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker, and he‚Äôs willing to put in the work required to get it!
---
Our server had something like 16 guilds doing MC/ony in vanilla and we were a medium pop server.
---
BuT ThAt Is ThE ClAsSiC ExPeRiEnCe
---
Ah makes sense I guess.
---
Very. Had 125g at 40, bought mount. I'm now 44, have 178g. All fishing all the time. Best profession hands down.
---
type /reload to skip all the menus.
---
Thank you for the input. That's exactly how I attempt to use it. Especially for WPVP when you get surprised by a melee while your busy killing some pigs. In these situation I could not tell CoE was making a big difference. My problem is that if the guy is on your face bashing you, if I slow him 24% or so and just walk away his attacks will still hit me. trying to place a weakness curse and fear seemed more helpful. My concern is that it feels not enough/ to situational for the amont of invested points.
---
Weird jump from "my" to "one", definitely unnecessary, but, you go grrl
---
As Kalakau mentioned earlier within this thread, agility is a central source of crit. The more critical chance, the more often flurry is activated. Faster attack speed can allow wind fury to proc faster, as more attacks are happening at a faster rate. To answer as to why agility is preferred over strength, well strength just effects raw melee weapon damage. Generally speaking a crit/wind fury proc/wind fury proc crit, while happening in an infrequent manor, will still greatly overcompensate for the extra weapon damage even if strength is your top priority.
---
My Tauren warrior begs to differ.
---
laughs in sacrifice
---
Yeah I have a 38 Shaman with 8 days played and a 20 Mage with 1 day played. Loving both of them and having a blast questing, helping others, fishing, wpvp, leveling professions. 
---
I think we are just seeing different chunks of the mmo community. The guys who got to 60 already had a plan and executed it, it's incredible to even get to 60 in under 10 days played (too many people listen to hardcore Pserver players who would laugh at you for saying 10 days is a good time to get to 60).
---
The vast majority of players are not hardcore Pserver guys, I think the curve has to be around 35-45 for casual players right now.
---
Maybe they think of cases like this as similar to scam which im sure is not allowed
---
Is there any add-on out there that gives you a dungeon map when you open your map inside a dungeon? As a new tank it would really be helpful to know where I'm going.
---
I hope she didn't pay the shard
---
Some add-ons can be a massive advantage compared to those who don't use them. 
---
Questie for example will increase your leveling speed significantly.
---
Spy will alert you when enemy players load in your area. 
---
If you want to play casually and take it easy, add-ons are optional. If you want to be competitive and have every advantage possible, add-ons are necessary.
---
I made it my own personal challenge to tank every 5 man in classic, but I know there's almost no way I could go up to raid content. But if we could get Classic+ that expands on shamtanking, I'd be in heaven
---
You‚Äôre number 1 Q.Q
---
You can still bring a warrior who does all these things and have a druid.
---
Tanks and healers served last? I'm not even sure how they're getting support classes to apply in the first place.
---
I think along the same lines. The 3) is important one that often isn't talked about. If you have to be reluctant about equipping an item, it's not something you should've needed on over others.
---
They seem Almighty butthurt about this despite it having ZERO affect on them in any meaningful way
---
Yup, Sir_jey is at the top of the list. A real scumbag. Trust me.
---
It has been one month. The guy has been assuming every role so far, because he doesn't have anyone he trusts to handle them. It's rather common for MTs to be RLs and for GMs to be ROs, he's merely doing all 4.
---
In any case, if you're feeling uncomfortable or worried with that (which is understandable), find a new guild, from what I've heard, people are looking for MTs everywhere...
---
This happens to my group all the time. We have the luxury of being a Paladin, Priest, Rogue, and Druid. We just dont grab another and 4 man the dungeon. It adds a nice layer of difficulty but it does slow it down alot. It is definately more enjoyable though because we can go at our pace and everyone gets to shine in their respective roles.
---
Interesting, didn't know that. Thanks for the info!
---
Honestly, my guild will start raiding in about 9 days. Seeing how we at most will manage to get 20 people to level 60 in that time, I'm inclined to believe we will have to fill up with pugs. If my guild pulled this and took legitimate loot away from one of the pugs, I'd leave them.
---
Best loot system ever. 
---
Your raid leader is honest, and master loots. and everyone who can use the loot as an upgrade can roll on it, pug or guildie and the winner gets it. One loot per person per raid, unless no one else needs the piece, or the only people who need it already had gotten loot.
---
Priority to main usage classes (hunters get priority on ranges weapons over rogues/warriors, rogues/warriors get priority over melee weapons over Hunters, etc.)
---
Hell if your raid leader is super cool, and he or she needs a piece and wins it, but realizes the person who also needs it would get a bigger upgrade, they might even give it to them!
---
*Source: i used to lead raids thru WotLK and I feel like I geared up about half my server. (Probably an exaggeration but although my guild got plenty of loot, I had regulars who would help fill it out that ended up in high end raiding guilds)
---
&gt;didn't contribute 
---
Dying early doesn't mean you didn't contribute. We also don't know what "early" even means. If we wanna take the guy who's clearly a guild member responding to the cross post on the servers sub, he's claiming the guy died at around 8 minutes into the fight. 
---
They clearly couldn't kill Ony on their own since they had to pug healers, and for all we know the dudes early fight healing could've been keeping their tank alive since their own healers couldn't.
---
If you bring someone to a raid as a pug because you need them, and don't explicitly before hand spell out an out of the ordinary loot rule set, they're on the same even playing field for loot as everyone else.
---
How was the GM supposed to know only one member needed the item?
---
Well said, it‚Äôs stuff like this that actually enhances the RPG aspect of the game and since  there‚Äôs no cross realm in Classic you even encounter the same people from time to time.
---
I don't think his point was prioritize loot to people who need it must. It was more using poor performance as a reason to not get loot is unintuitive since performance is heavily tied to how good your gear is.
---
Also what's the point of your second paragraph? These assholes don't deserve empathy and even if you put yourselves in their shoes they're still huge assholes.
---
If he has so much time on his hands then it might work.
---
I can understand being a raid leader/gm and mt. That doesnt seem too far fetched, but doing all the recruitment as one person if you are really pushing for it.
---
Making money off what exactly?  I leveled fishing up to 250ish but havent continued because most of what I caught was worthless besides some stonescales.
---
so \~1.8MIL xp to go!   --- thanks for the misery
---
honestly though good work.
---
This is just evil. Its goes past the whole "pvp server so its all fair". You're just ruining  someone's day if you do this.
---
Yeah, fair point.
---
Loot council is tremendously unnecessary unless you are a hardcore progression guild.    DKP is a much better system and less open to cliques assigning loot to their friends.
---
No store mount is going to compete with the good ol' (insert standard mount for class here)
---
You are correct that on retail addons can tell. I had two WAs for spell cast bars. One smaller one for uninterruptible spells (b/c I still want to know they are casting), and one large one mid screen if it's interruptable. 
---
Warning to all rogues on stuns. As a tank I appreciate stuns on those hard hitters (though most hard hitters are immune) but not on regular trash. Me want get hit so me get mad (rage) so me can hit harder, so they stay mad at only me. This goes to DPS warriors as well, don't charge a mob that I've range pulled before it got to me.
---
LOL, Holy crap.  That's what I was thinking as soon as I seen that.  Yes, I am a Holy Paladin and this is what I want to look like also....   &lt;cries in holy paladin&gt;
---
Are you dumb? Do you think the GM does no follow up on the matter or doesn't have access to all the chat logs?
---
Get the Add-On "Spy" and add him to your Kill-On-Sight list. It will give you a pop-up message when he is nearby again.
---
Because some guilds are shitty like that.
---
I've wondered this for a while, the 'chance on hit' abilities... what chance is that? Are they always a set % or does it vary by weapon? Is there a way to improve the chance? I've always stayed clear of equipment like this because i hate equipping something that i dont have enough info or understanding of to compare to my current gear.
---
Thank you, so it would have to be maxed out to be really efficient.
---
*grunts meaningfully*
---
Lol no it's not. Fucking vile my ass.
---
Open your social window (the one that shows you friends/guild/raid/who)
---
Go to the 'Groups' tab
---
Go to the group that you want to leave, right click the name (on the left side) and click on 'Leave Group' (last option)
---
In our guild it actually achieved the opposite of hoarding. People would 'buy low' so to speak. If you just want upgrades you will pay less but you can't be too picky. If you are dead set on a specific item you will get it too at a higher cost. 
---
The main advantage though is that it rotates who gets loot quicker. The second advantage is that we don't have to assign arbitrary dkp cost tp items.
---
lol @ thinking one hamster wheel is better than the other hamster wheel. You're just on a different wheel, it's all the same.
---
yeah the best way to measure this I think would be how many even-levels mobs would you need to kill in order to level up.
---
It's the only thing that worked for me on my Chromebook and I know they have an Android app. Just not sure what the controls are like on mobile
---
And screams, ‚ÄúGET OVER HERE!!‚Äù
---
Ok dude.
---
&gt;I see the whiteknights are out in force
---
You don't know what that term is. Stop using it. 
---
&gt;Its a MMO, get 5 other friends and kill them
---
I'm fine with 5v5. I'm not fine with needing 4 friends to fight somebody, simply because he paid more money. I'm against any form of pay to win, in any game. This is clearly pay to win. 
---
&gt;blizzard doesnt mind them because it gives NO benefit in the grand scheme of things at all
---
Ya I know blizzard doesn't care, but it does give an advantage. It gives advantages for gathering, questing, doing dungeons. It's banned in other games because it gives people a huge advantage.
---
It really is surprising though. My guild has run with pugs in the past and I've joined other guild's pugs as well and I have never seen a guild just break the loot rules to favor guildies. It obviously happens but it's far from being the standard.
---
Many ways for it to happen but, it essentially boils down to, stealing or taking  loot in a manner that was not agreed upon on how the loot would be distributed.
---
Can‚Äôt vendor enchanting mats
---
Threatplates does this
---
happy kek day
---
Thats quite decent for a fresh toon! More importantly, I hope you're enjoying classic &lt;3
---
Naxx mechanics are easy af, it's just gear.  40 good raiders in retail can clear naxx with gear.
---
Isn‚Äôt this behavior bannable now?
---
&gt; lack of good pop-up blockers and anti-virus to keep up with the all the garbage that came with it. 
---
What? The internet was much cleaner back then, AND there was good free antivirus and anti-malware that wasn't garbage bloatware like it is today...
---
Would argue the improved gouge is better than the 3% dodge chance while leveling/wpvp
---
Deviate stacks, oilies I turn into oil and make faps from, firefin stacks, eel stacks, and if course mithril trunks. Rumsey Black label is a gold a stack. It's all money all the time.
---
It also depends on how many people are trying to level up cooking
---
You seem to be assuming a certain group composition for those 4 without saying what it actually is, and a lot of your logic is weird.
---
&gt;Hunter DPS is good, but they want all the gear and can come with pet issues.
---
Hunters definitely do not want all the gear. Most gear that drops is terrible for us. We literally only want gear that has agility, crit, or hit on it. Having intellect would be a bonus but we don't want an item with only intellect under any circumstances, and we don't care about strength or spell damage at all. Any worthwhile hunter is also going to have tight control over their pet, there won't be any issues from that. Besides, what about warlock pets? You're not worried about them?
---
I got ganked in stone talon mts by a ?? Alliance.  He camped me.  I just took rez sickness.  Apparently that pissed him off.  So, this guy came to the camp and then fucking murdered all the guards and everyone there.  Including me that was just sitting in the Inn trying to wait out my rez sickness.
---
And if that rage is the rage t hey need at the very beginning of the fight to hold aggro, then that becomes a problem.
---
Since the day BC launched. So 12.5 years.
---
As a level 54 shaman specced as 31/0/14, how far through BRD can I heal? I cannot recall what level the instance demands, or what 'parts' can be cleared by my level. I've avoided forming a group as I do not know what levels I should be recruiting
---
They are saying you get a free warlock mount so the 30-40g for the cloth is okay to spend
---
This kind of shit ALWAYS starts with someone saying "Person_03 is underperforming, we'd clear faster if we gave the loot to Person_07 instead."  Sometimes they're even right.  But it doesn't take long at all for that to turn into "Y'know what, we're just going to give loot to the people we think deserve it" and that's how guilds break up.
---
Fair loot systems mean that sometimes you give the best loot to the worst person because that's what's fair.
---
Idk what your gettimg at. But if are the last person to join the group then for you it was instant
---
&gt;6.1 Do you usually change targets?
---
&gt;Your opinion on what a DPS should do
---
For the love of god, wait at least one global before attacking. Two is optimal. And dont all of you choose different targets.
---
&gt;What is your reaction when you see mobs attacking a DPS or the Healer?
---
Dps: Retard
---
Healer: I fucked up better get aggro or we wipe
---
Lmao at this hunter COINTELPRO
---
Yeah so they can all wear their Star of David proudly...
---
Seriously, just play the game.
---
He logs on for a few hours, sometimes goes mia for 3 days. That's why I'm concerned.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äústealing‚Äù gear. So in OP‚Äôs case, it looks like they were told to roll for the gear and even though OP won the roll, they gave the loot to somebody else. In most cases though it‚Äôs when a rare item drops and everybody rolls greed, either because they are naive or have too much trust in their group, and somebody intentionally rolls Need so that they can take it
---
Before or after Four Horseman were overturned AF?  :p
---
yeah the cleave is going to make some pretty horrendous lvl 60 players, which is so very classic anyway.
---
I've been playing since vanilla, and that's exactly how I'm behaving.   
---
If epics BOE drops, IMO everyone should roll greed (however if everyone rolls need it doesn't change much) EXCEPT if someone really needs it right away and in this case they should equip it on the spot.
---
This looks like alliance was up to no good.
---
&gt; The caveat to it was that players wearing shit gear had to take big upgrades and pay for them rather than getting carried in greens and blues and then using their points for one of the major weapons or cross-class loot.
---
For some classes like hunter a weapon is 3-4x as important as any other piece. And if you force them to take the lets say wrists and waste dkp now they dont have a weapon, good job genius you improved their dps by 1% instead of 20.
---
DKP is the stupidest system ever it is basically rich get richer.    And dont get me started on the tier gear/tokens good luck getting anything as a new recruit, maybe after 10+ clears your turn will come.   
---
Dkp is the most retarded system  for loot, and promotes collusion and corruption.
---
Why would you want that? Im sure that at least 50% of the people on the list would be there because the assholes that should be on the list reported them.
---
Who is going to determine who deserves to be on the list? And who can prove anything?
---
Anything you can think of as a reason can be missused.
---
Ninja loot?
---
- if it was ML it might have been a case that the master looter told it is reserved before the run
---
- if it was a GL then it might have been a missclick
---
Gank?
---
- you might have ganked his friend before
---
Fucked you in a trade?
---
- i think blizz will handle that
---
I like druid tanks but they do not have the best single target threat. Warriors are able to hold threat on 2000 DPS if they‚Äôre good enough.
---
I've seen those kind of videos
---
I don't understand why it is still not down.
---
* Thorium is now rather easy to get to honored (likely you have cheap kingsblood on AH and alike + you can get/buy dark iron residue) - some tailoring patterns. If you have access to MC mats then you can aim at revered to get pants pattern in P3
---
* You can look for Timbermaw rep farm groups - meh tailoring patterns, but self-heal offhand for the fun of it or trinket at exalted if you are a psychic ;)
---
* Hydraxian for MC douses
---
* Argent Dawn - run Strat/Scholo, start turning in scourgestones at revered until you get exalted -&gt; enchant tokens, future tailoring patterns, gear turn in quests etc. Best water available now.
---
That seems pretty simple to keep track of, which is also a bonus.
---
I assumed they may have been together at that point, and are now referring to them as their ex as they broke up since.
---
Cool.
---
Calling out OP saying it was possibly only 30 sec.... like find something better to do with your time? 
---
That‚Äôs what I was getting at sorry üòê
---
Server merges when needed, instead of a negative solution used proactively, like layering. 
---
The thing is, server merges are absolutely in Classics future. Maybe not in the next few months, but perhaps 2 years, 4 years, or 10 years obviously. They‚Äôre trying to balance the hype with a really awkward tool, that Blizz admits themselves is ‚Äúantithetical‚Äù, when merges are a simple solution. They aren‚Äôt a perfect solution, but it‚Äôs miles better than layering.
---
Throw a renew on him as the fight commences, then lesser heals as the fight goes on. Shield is your oh shit button when he‚Äôs about to die to buy you a second of casting time for a heal. 
---
And yes, with Druid tanks and Warrior tanks, they generate rage by giving and receiving damage. Most of which comes from receiving since they pull multiple mobs at once.
---
Same, straight into 6 was no doubt I'll stick around. Having so much fun, 270ish hours in so far while working full time.
---
I may need a life. Help.
---
Sweet summer child
---
*laughs in chain lightning*
---
I think seeing enemy buffs is a mage spell.
---
Yeah I get it, will give it a shot again.   
---
Do you have it maxed out or would you say it can be already efficient with less points in it ?
---
My 41 warrior buddy owes me after I threw on my pally dress nd kept him alive while he killed that elite cyclone for his WW axe, thx for the suggestion! I took a look at some end game maces...there are some rly nice ones. I much prefer 2H tho but am always on the lookout for a good 1H too
---
I have 3 kids, my wife‚Äôs mother and 2 sick dogs because my wife is a vet. My money isn‚Äôt for me. I work those hours so they can have everything they want. WoW is my only thing really.
---
This is how I look at it as well.
---
It's not 2006 anymore, hunters are no longer the class attracting bad players.
---
I can't get Auctioneer to load properly...downloaded and extracted to the correct folder. It's not showing up at login, and not showing up for 'load out of date addons.' What are my next steps? I haven't been able to successfully install addons through the Twitch app either so I'm doing it manually. Thanks!
---
As a tank (with preraid and plenty MC items at this point), the "tank for hire" thing is taking more time than I like to catch on. I keep telling people "sure I'll join for your strat/scholo/lbrs if \[payment in some fashion\] is met. Often this just falls on deaf ears and they keep looking for another 30 minutes until they disband or get a warrior 3 levels too low to tank and probably have an awful run. People simply don't realize that if I have no use for the dungeon then I'm not interested in joining without some incentive.
---
But I think it's simply a matter of time once people realize that it's actually nice to do scholo within 40 minutes instead of 3 hours with wipes. At least I hope so, because I need more gold.
---
Preach my dude....preach.
---
I kind of agree. My current guild is a loot council guild and it's the first time where I feel officers aren't biased towards themselves, the other 2 experiences I had were like you described.
---
Congrats. Hope that shadow priest didn't body you. Thery are one of the strongest 1v1. How much did you get for it?
---
The only way you aren‚Äôt replacing that item is if you are a twink, or it is a BiS endgame item.  In both cases, you already have the ability to purchase said item and so you are literally being greedy by needing that item.
---
Look at that green cloud around him, get you a contact high!
---
What about a hybrid class being forced to heal but outside of that raid dps is their main spec.
---
In a group with 2 warrior last night doing ST. The only reason we didn‚Äôt wipe a bunch was out bad ass healer. Group didn‚Äôt have much CC as it was but what we did have you can guarantee the warriors would charge it and break cc.
---
I think he doesn't realize shamans can't dual wield
---
They just want to be technically correct. The best kind of correct.
---
I hate you so much.
---
R u being serious? Its Joji dawg
---
Same here! Never knew this.
---
It was a major pain, but it was transparent and no one argued against it at the time.  You could look at the site and know exactly how much dkp you or other people had.
---
So, after 24 hours you‚Äôre good to play with that name or do you have to change it ?
---
Am I the only one who is kind of okay with this? Part of the fun of guilds and 60 is politics and networking. I think the guild *should* get priority on drops over a handful of pick-up players. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay if no one needs it to not allow pick-up payers to get it, but if it comes down to a guildie who needs it and a pick-up who needs it, then the guildie should get it. They put in time and effort in the guild and the reason there‚Äôs even a raid group is because the guild organized it. That being said, it should be clearly communicated before hand if that‚Äôs the case. And if people don‚Äôt like it they should be actively trying to get into a guild for the privileges of their work and community. It feels a little freeloader-ish.
---
Thanks for the info, just curious. How does XP and looting mobs work in groups of people? Does it get shared?
---
Although I've never experienced Vanilla endgame, I've been tanking in dungeons for aslong as I can remember on my Tauren Druid and nobody ever complained about my tanking. People who think feral is bad just need to play a Druid to see for themselves
---
The person who received the loot rolled lower than the other guy, what are you on about?
---
I MC, run them to the edge, then throw up my superior fort buff so they have to remember me for 30mins.
---
I play on a high pop server and the other day I went to SM to continue leveling there and there were only like 8 people there. Got into a group and suddenly 30+ people appeared. Annoying.
---
Remulos- Oceana
---
Never had to queue to play. 
---
Barrens chat full of keanu reeves puns
---
Not a PvP server
---
With loot council guilds it's so much of a stereotype that it's assumed they do it.
---
I recently broke my hand so I'm stuck playing one-handed for a while and I've been wanting to finally start Classic.  What class would be best to play one-handed?
---
I got it on my second run! Combat swords rogue :) the warrior tank in the group choose not to roll since he had just gotten the cloak off the beast master!
---
That‚Äôs not how things work
---
Nobody looks good in this scenario.  The staff obviously should've gone to the druid and everyone else who rolled need was being rude and greedy.
---
That said, the druid's behavior is petulant, harassing, *and* probably rule breaking and you should help your guildie by contacting a GM about it.
---
I saw a guild do it the absolute worst way. 
---
Guild lead rolled for his guild's loot council, and all pugs who needed rolled too. So it was 3 pugs vs guild lead. Needless to say they lost quite a lot of shig. That's a solid 1/4 for your guild instead of having everyone roll and if a guildie wins it gets LCd. It was their first guild raid and the guild insider I had was saying people were losing it because "we have a better chance getting loot as a pug?"
---
This is an excellent story
---
Im thinking that will be its replacement as well. I dont have the heart to sell it so itll go in my bank next to my starting hammer lol
---
Bezerk is tied to your health. Less health = more attached speed.
---
Especially the paintball episodes
---
This mindset is too commonplace and also ignores the fact that part of the reason someone could be underperforming is their gear
---
You're right: having layering exploits that can potentially destroy the economy of the game is a better idea than free transfers (from high pop to low pop realms) and the ability to exit chronically low realms. This is why cross realms was invented, even though classic players whine about retail, because then the concept of "dead realms" ceases to exist.
---
You guys want your cake and to eat it too...classic wow means uneven realms. Don't like it? Come hack to retail, and see what 14 years of iteration looks like. A much more polished game imo....I came back for classic, but I'm staying for retail. Why? Because it's more engaging and alive. A quest taking 20 minutes for mobs to respawn doesn't interest me.
---
Wish I could say the same but I tried so many god damn times to get the BRD quests done but my groups kept ignoring most of the quest objectives despite me asking if we could do them and everyone agreeing.
---
Never underestimate how often people will be dicks if they have the opportunity to.
---
This seems wrong, I remember tons of blue posts about rooftop camping in Gadgetzan when I was a kid...
---
Yeah but it's like a 50 percent drop rate and you stealth run it. It's not bad at all. But yeah I can see it getting annoying.
---
Isn't witchblade + ST OH / Linken's OH pretty standard pre-bis for all caster dps?
---
Can't imagine SoJ being better, pre-raid
---
Congrats. Hope that shadow priest didn't body you. They are one of the strongest 1v1. How much did you get for it?
---
&gt;Oh yes im sure that cloned keystrokes will help me target and heal /s
---
It does. You can assist your target with macros. Do you can cast spells on your tanks target, and heals on the tank. Without targeting. I get the feeling you have never set up multiboxing accounts. 
---
&gt;It gives no advantage in pvp at all, the honour is still split 5 ways
---
It does give an advantage because you can kill people you wouldn't have been able to alone. 
---
&gt;ALL higher end content is instanced, and 5+ man all the battlegrounds and all the raids
---
So what?
---
Didn‚Äôt know this
---
Warlocks are very solid to level.  Probably in the top bracket with Druids, Mages and Hunters.
---
In he time it takes you to manually post stuff like that I already posted 50 stacks 1 copper lower
---
Fairest form for anyone too loot is to check who needs it, then letting those people roll followed by giving to the winner. Ninjas, Loot Councils, etc it just complicates it too much imo.
---
No warlock :(
---
I live in the Midwest. Take a deep breath. You'll be ok.
---
Different guilds raid at different times, find one that fits your schedule, profit.
---
It's amazing that someone would report that, and even more amazing that blizzard cares
---
wtf
---
Jesus, what is this a payday loan?
---
Had a bad experience so far in Classic with Female Tauren druid.  My group was patiently waiting for a quest mob to respawn, she and her rogue buddy come running up moonfire'ing every mob in sight, tag the quest mob and proceed to stay in the area camping the body.  I told them they were griefing and she called me a lil bitch! How rude!
---
I had a guild that used to use loot council in one of the most fair ways I've seen. First there was an addon to show who wanted each item. Everyone could see who their competition was.  
---
Then, each week 2 random people from the raid were "promoted" to a loot council rank. They could see /o chat in guild and were involved in all choices for loot drops. So those 2 + the 3 static officers decided who got what.  
---
The next week, those 2 would be "demoted" back to their previous rank and 2 other's would fill the role. It kept it very transparent and got rid of any "inner circle" drama that I've seen in so many other groups.
---
This is standard economic science. As Milton Friedman said "Inflation is always and everywhere a **monetary phenomenon** in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output".  
---
The overall price level is much lower than on retail because the quantity of money (gold) is much lower compared with the quantity of goods on offer.  
---
As the quantity of gold held by the player population increases, so will the overall price level, because the overall quantity of goods will not increase as much - the total quantity of goods produced should, in fact, go down as players are farming less and skinning less after they are done leveling.
---
And all of that was okay, cause it was in a three way!
---
If you are on Blaumeux do not group with anyone from &lt;Rick and Morty&gt; they may seem like intellectuals from an outside perspective but the GM Smashingkeys has ninja looted from multiple groups and is very toxic. Proof can be found in the Blaumeux server discord if you search his name.
---
? That doesn't make any sense.
---
He just kind of kept on rolling by there were several other hories around so thank god for that. Havent sold yet a quick look at ah had the listed at 850+ on my sever so I should be able to get a good amount.
---
Private bidding can lead to the formation of class cartels, where the warriors for example all agree on what the winning bid will be and the other warriors throw in a range of bids lower than that to make it seem like it's a real competition.  This allows the cartel members to save up dkp for cross-class items since they're not spending a lot on warrior items.
---
Interesting way to challenge yourselves
---
Druids actually aren‚Äôt that great since you can‚Äôt front-shred anymore. I leveled one on a private server and it was much faster than leveling on classic. 
---
Most guilds already have their tanks in place though, that‚Äôs the issue. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre raiding or not. You only need 2-3 tanks for 40 people, which leaves very little room to find an actual roll tanking.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/
---
I was gutted when they took this out of retail, so much fun
---
Had one guild like that. My favorite loot system ever. Never saw any loot drama there. Though it probably helped it was a bit of an old fart guild.
---
I thought curse of tongues just made spell casting longer.
---
I think you're reading too much into that "automatically" and they actually mean they have a fair loot system
---
That might of happened at times and I'm sure it did, but most to almost all of the time the guild as a whole would decide that on their own.
---
It was usually a discussion within the raid on loot and not just one all powerful gm handing it out as they saw fit. 
---
It wasn't until the the folks who wanted a crack at "top raiding" started to really want to maximize who got what based off of raid participation that things started getting toxic. 
---
"We can't give this new shiny shield to " 4th" tank when our main tank needs it. 
---
Well it turns out you can haha
---
They backtracked on the name change.. somwehat. They changed it to Blizzard App which is a terrible name of course. Now its Blizzard Battle.net
---
The problem is, in a PUG, there's no way to verify if the person will use it later or sell. So it's better if everyone just needs on good BOE's
---
I find it funny...  It's classic, it's all been done before.  People treating it all serious like and ninja looting stuff and saying "top guild" and saying people suck etc...
---
It's like working at McDonalds and bragging cuz you got a .10 cent raise.
---
We've all been there before, we moved on to new things, were just having fun doing something nostalgic.
---
God bless layering.../s
---
Dark Pact
---
No.
---
What I mean by "hidden away" is not that it's hidden where someone can't access it, but no one can collaborate on it.
---
I mean, if someone fixes someone's bad addon code, great. Now how do they share it with others? Post a new "version" of it on Twitch? That's always a bad idea. Much better to collaborate on the original code repo, create pull requests, create issues for discussion with code reviews, etc. Proper collaboration.
---
just ignore them lol it's really not worth your time 
---
get used to shit like this as a raiding guild master, youve got a lot of bullshit drama ahead of you to manage, both internal and external
---
if theres no proof then ignore and move on
---
Also, warrior rage generation sucks while leveling. I cannot cast shieldblock on cooldown because that starves my rage and dps will pull threat.
---
At ~60 and with gear it becomes less of an issue because you can keep ~100% shield block uptime and use abilities for threat.
---
I checked last night, there were like 5 copies, all for 1g20s bid and 2g buyout.
---
I was thinking just picking up a couple of copies, and undercutting by like half.
---
Then make it clear before raiding what you're after, but you don't get to roll for two roles.
---
Only if the loot rules are announced at the start, otherwise you're straight up scamming.
---
"Alright give it to me so i can shard it and give it back.*equips helm*" people be dumb enough to do it.
---
It's going onto a place you're not supposed to be. Read the rules.
---
You will get a good amount and a mount...thehehe
---
That's super good that you would be able to get an epic mount when you're 60. Makes you more efficient.
---
I'm level 55 Paladin and still using Kang the Decapitator. Do you think that's good enough to last me until the level 60 dungeons open up more options?
---
My original name was BigJohnson. The kicker was, I got forced rename but I saw similar names like BigDJohnson that skated by.
---
Hey guys i cant play classic anymore because im a very cool person irl and have lots of jobs.
---
btw here u guys get flexd on
---
So i am only a 15 mage right now so havent done much group content and forget how it works but why do people leave it on free for all again? Is there no trading of items within groups like in retail i assume?
---
Outrage for the sake of outrage tbh.
---
The only class I hate is hunter, like ffs, get your shit together hunters. But ye, ima warrior. Not gonna inv a hunter ever again, unless i am forced to.
---
Yesterday in zf this 1 hunter started fights multishotting before my charge finished. I told him 3 times that I cannot hold aggro that way. After those 3 times I did not give a fuck anymore. I think he died 7 times after that (blaming me for not trying to get them back, ofc). Was funny watching him run around me tho. On the stairs his pet randomly started sprinting down, pulling everything and wiping us. 
---
Whenever hunter are in the group shit like this happens. Luckily as a tank I can lf groups easily so I do not have to deal with this anymore...
---
Yeah honestly mages are ridiculous in PvP. If they cant fight you, they just polymorph you. If they can fight you, they polymorph you, get max range and then just start chipping away at your dreams one frostbolt at a time.
---
You can tank anything outside of raids with any spec you want, it's up to you.
---
I mean so far talking to people on reddit it seems like my best option is to either play with a team of 5 ALWAYS where we have set rules, or a team of 3/4 with the goal of intentionally fucking our two randoms.
---
Meanwhile there's a guy on my server that's name is literally hate speech and nothing happens to him
---
Seriously. Forsaken vs everyone!!
---
Hey man, what UI is this?
---
Exploiting to evade guards.
---
What I did to find a balance between leveling and playing the AH is to just grind out the levels and mail all sellable loot to an AH alt. I focus on humanoids to get that sweet sweet cloth to sell
---
I never raided in Vanilla, so I'm sorry I don't know. I raided in later expacs.
---
Also, I think Argent Dawn has the only shoulder enchants, IIRC, you could go for that.
---
Sometimes equal isn't fair, sometimes fair isn't equal.
---
If you're not showing up to most raids, why shouldn't loot be more likely to go to someone who shows up to all raids?
---
So reading through that quickly, they are ninjas and its bs. This extra info (could be fakes but I give benefit of the doubt, since people went out of their way to screen shot etc) F those guy
---
OP needs to learn more about the fight as well though, seems like they had some issues, but thats fixable.
---
hot
---
I think OP is saying that *people* think AH is saturated due to layering (people farming tons of mats and stuffing the AH)
---
Go hangout in ZF for a bit. You can get some solid drops and really solid exp.
---
I legit didn‚Äôt think that was a thing
---
like I spent weeks at the start of Cata tanking from the roofs in Ramkahen
---
But bruh, did you know that all you bring to a group is your lockpicking skill? And you BETTER let everyone roll on that locked chest! /s
---
I had a similar experience as well. 
---
On my blue +healing stacked paladin I joined a guild that was already clearing MC and pretty much decked out in epics. After 3 raids pretty much topping all the relevant healing meters (their holy paladins were running around in a lot of t1), the Salamander scale pants dropped.
---
Noone wanted them so I was happy until the raid leader said I couldn't get them because they weren't plate. (I was using Padres trousers) 
---
A 15 minute discussion sparked where I got backed up by the priests and druids. Somehow the paladins were the least supportive, especially the full t1 guy who on some fights got outhealed by warlocks.
---
In the end the raid leader still wanted to shard them but was under so much pressure of his healers that he had to give them to me. I used them til the very end of the guild and even on the r14 grind I never swapped them for plate.
---
Sometimes people insult the minmaxers of Classic and say this isn't Vanilla but they forgot shit like this happened as well.
---
If he stated /roll for loot than it is.   Blizzard ToS enforces it and they will remove the item and give it to the winner.  Also give a warning to the ML and can get banned if it happens to often.  Only way around this is if it's made clear at the beginning of the raid that the are loot conditions.
---
Good, you have more time to play WoW!
---
Yeah unfortunately because Blizzard is strict with names on RP realms breaking the TOS they have to be consistent and be strict with name TOS on all realms, it would be ‚Äòunfair‚Äô otherwise.
---
Tallywacker is a great name too, especially for a Warrior that just wacks shit with a hammer. What class did you role?
---
HoJ is one of the few items that would work in forms since it‚Äôs ¬´on melee hit¬ª and not a weapon proc or enchant. But hoj isn‚Äôt all that good considering the shitty cat white damage
---
You have to. The post says there‚Äôs no emergency button for druids, but mcp is kinda it. Conversely, it‚Äôs also used to get ahead - as it‚Äôs the primary vehicle for insane threat-per-second that allows your raid‚Äôs dps to go all out. 
---
The good part though, is that it‚Äôs super easy. You need maybe 5-8 per week which is about 2 hours of farming. 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs more of a pain as horde bc it takes longer to get to Gnomer, but once you‚Äôre there you just grind it out like any other raid consumable.
---
I don't advocate fucking over randoms, but sure, in a multiplayer game it's always good to have friends.
---
I‚Äôm 37.5 with 25, you‚Äôre totally ahead by a mile dude. Don‚Äôt sweat at all. I‚Äôve got 5 BOe blues in the bank but otherwise I‚Äôve been scrimping like crazy. You‚Äôre totally fine dude.
---

They even clearly state the reason this is enforced is the same reason how if you trade someone mats for something and they do not provide it they can get involved. 
---
It's considered being scammed out of something agreed on.
---
&gt;Nevertheless, if you do get into a situation where the Master Looter disregards the previous agreements that have been made between them and the group, you can report it to us by submitting an in-game ticket. We will be able to investigate the issue and take appropriate action should a scam have occurred;
---
That's fair. I definitely see how it could save your life in some situations. It's all up to what gear you're using and if you see some use for it. It's why classic is so good.
---
You can solo mara at 60 for the sword, go for that +aquementas
---
Also that warriors hitting things gives rage. It's the best tank weapon til thunderfury or QS, both equally rare items to ironfoe.
---
Lol versatility in the game? I don‚Äôt think that got added until MoP or Cata. I believe the first extra PvP stat they add is resilience in TBC.
---
"SHE COST A FIVER"

"Awwwwwww...."

"I HAD A TENNER!!!!!"

"YAAAAAAAAAY!!!!"

Was leather ever really worth anything? It has always been the most worthless commodity because a mage with skinning can supply half the server with all the leather they need lol. It's the most abundant resource because all you need to do is kill beasts.
---
They ain't no guildies of mine rest assured.
---
This is exactly it.
---
you are taking your experiences and assuming thats the norm when inreality stealing from pugs happens far more often than people realize and most people dont take to reddit or the forums to complain they either file a report or just let it go and blacklist the players and move on.
---
I only did ZF runs as ele then went back to questing, but the aoe you do easily beats melee and locks on most pulls (never  had a mage in a dozen runs, wiindfury OP). Chain and  Fire Nova on CD, magma  totem right after Nova goes off, and just melee in between. You can squeeze in mana ticks between fire  novas if  you skip chain.
---
I think I was averaging 4-500 dps on zombie pulls and in the 300s on regular 3-4 mobs pulls.
---
Feralas is a good place. Good kill quests.
---
FFS I chose a hunter in retail played up to wotlk huntard being something I hated so I improved to the point people actually liked taking me to shit. Now I choose mage because I thought it would be a fun change ONLY TO BE CALLED THE NEW HUNTARD, please end me.
---
I subbed 3 month back when I reserved my name. I don't think it was a bad decision. That said, changing guilds 3 weeks in wasn't the plan either. I hope the new one is one that will keep me invested for months on end
---
Thats called a free name vhange in my book.
---
So you wanted to leech gear from this guild? You died. You get no loot.
---
I vaguely recall seeing a few GMs running around and checking up on us when the game was first released. Doubt that's still happening though.
---
Hunter &gt; Warlock &gt; Mage &gt; Feral IMO
---
mage armor instead of frost armor???
---
nice picture, hate gnomes &lt;:)
---
It's not that they don't know *how* to press Frostbolt. It's that they don't know *when*.
---
From my experience - and the experience of many others - the norm is for level 60 Mages to indiscriminately AE in situations where it's not appropriate, draw aggro and either drain the healer's mana or die.
---
Mage is one of the easier setups for a warlock, but it often comes down to skill and what pet you got out, since the skill ceiling for both classes is rather high.   
---
Magewill usually open up with a sheep, if you have the hound, dispell it. If you dont and he starts casting pyro and sh\*t, either pop your VW shield or spell stone or health stone once it lands. If the mage blows all his instant casts and you are alive, you have basically won.  
---
If you have the succubus out, guess what you will do... Only Imp leaves you at an disadvantage.
---
Since most mages will be frost at the moment a quick work about their best spell, Ice Block. Assuming CDs are ready he can use the block 2 times. If he is smart he will block your death coil, so you might want to try to fake the coil with a nightfall proc, but that's pretty RNG dependant. The block lasts up to 10 seconds and removes any dot, fear and everything else you have, so it kinda resets the fight. Getting the mage to use an early block is a massiv advantage!  
---
Also use your engineering grenades, they help a lot.
---
Now I prepare for the downvotes from all the mages for saying they are an easy matchup... :p
---
That was awesome. Glad i did not roll on that server, but that was super cool that the entire server was helping out.
---
You can do Uldaman runs over and over, or go to Tanaris and grind scorpions, and basilisks for a few levels.  They are a cake walk to kill and drop grey items that sell for a surprising amount of silver. It adds up.
---
Not entirely as Life Tap doesn't trigger the 5 second rule.
---
All of those examples have prioritized gold over said item.  It is exactly the same.  You want the gold, they want the gold.
---
These people are exaggerating.. It's not worth your time.
---
Feralas if you havent been yet.
---
Badlands
---
Maybe Hinterlands
---
ZF and ULDA also. Or just straight grinding.
---
Because of how shit most plate helms look on trolls.
---
And conversely, a bear levelling tank spec will also do just fine as a solo cat; and you can even level with a hybrid spec that picks up almost exclusively talents that work in either form.
---
The only cat-specific talent you'll miss while levelling as feral is feline swiftness; but it's such a good talent that you should take it anyway.
---
TLDR:
---
1. Bears are fine tanks and presently optimal given the relatively low gear levels. This won't change until BWL/AQ40, and will even out by Naxx.
---
2. Warriors will always be necessary for a few bosses due to mechanics.
---
3. Lots of Warriors are hopelessly insecure.
---
4. Lots of Healers in this thread whining about how bears are "hard to heal" and prefer spiky incoming damage to consistent need to reroll.
---
And then you get ninja looted and back to reddit to complain. Or the person that Needed just sells the item. All need solves all the problem and needs no cooperation and leaves no place to errors/whining/different mentality. It's the only way it can work.
---
Indeed, I only level with a partner so I have free time others would spend leveling. That being said, I never made this much money in vanilla or TBC when leveling, not even close, and I was a fairly efficient leveler back then.
---
I‚Äôm not sure honestly. In my head, you get out your large DPS and throw up the DoT before you wand them down. I‚Äôd have to test and see what difference there is
---
Dude just talk to your party it's a social game
---
Crying on Reddit isn't gonna accomplish anything

https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023

It has always been a thing.
---
It's heavy enough to do some serious damage if you throw it at your ennemy !!
---
You're only stopping yourself from making money. I spend about 70+gold each log in on low priced cloth and make bags for my first 30 minutes logged in. After putting them in the AH (50silver to 1.75g more than the mats) I wait a day and collect. I don't know how the other professions are doing but tailoring is free bank in a new game. Got a bunch of pre raid BIS BOEs and now saving up for a loose eye of shadow in the AH
---
That is not how layers work. All layering does is stop the overcrowding of the zones. The server can handle the people already.
---
To be fair, you had a lot of people (me included) who subbed for the name reservation period, so it's probably split on when the resub wave actually hit.
---
I don't remember "BiS" being a widely-known concept back then.
---
Sad
---
Came naturally to me by just grinding lv60 dungeons, which was what I wanted to do anyway. Sell runecloth, vendor trash, made maybe 25g/run on average but ofc got all the rep/item drops too. Finding groups was ofc easier as I tanked.
---
Worth noting that you can pick up Druid tier pieces easily (and other leather healing) easily in MC and Ony, for the fights when you‚Äôre healing/decursing.
---
I just want the healing pants :(
---
Oily blackmouths put my kids through mount college.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. It is a very cool weapon, but this is definitely a huge waste of money.
---
1hd + offhand is always better. If you are 60 you can solo the Maraudon boss for the sword, offhand take the one from Un'Goro. Once AV lands get the Book at exalted rep.
---
**'YOU'VE JUST MADE AN ENEMY FOR LIFE!"**
---
I love the video so much!
---
The part with the glasses always gets me!
---
Im simply analyzing the advice given to me by the community to "succeed" and its basically like playing a bard in dnd. Fuck anyone, everyone, and anything not nailed down... however bonus points if its tied down.
---
You're mismanaging your mana. Priests dont need 50% of the mana let alone all of it.
---
They can pull while you're drinking.
---
I was a Human Mage. On retail a Human Paladin, I was happy with my name too :(
---
You can heal in any spec for a while. But take 5 ranks in ancenstral knowledge from enhance tree.
---
&gt;Youve been downvoted to oblivion each and every time you try to bash this home
---
So what? That has no bearing on multiboxing being an advantage or not.
---
Thank you. I'm a warrior and been looking for something like that in classic myself. I was hoping to find something like the old outfitter addon and this here looks similar.
---
Will try it out after work.
---
The 5th person is there to get a majority vote and if they change it up everytime, everybody will be part of the council at some point. I think the system is pretty good but depends a lot on the officers who make up the council.
---
A little, the alchemy doubles the oilies value at the current prices. It's not much but it's more than nothing until the economies stabilize.
---
What makes you think OP Needs friends or guildies? I leveled 30-60 just fine "LFM ZF AoE Group Need 3 mages 1 priest fast runs 70-100k xp per hour"
---
And they lack the real cooldowns to save themselves when shit goes bad.
---
During a bad pull with a warrior when he hits 10% and I'm oom I know he's got a few more seconds alive to pop CDs and whatnot and keep himself up, whereas it's.basicslly a death sentence on a druid.
---
I'll still always take the first tank that offers when I'm LFG, but if I've got a choice I'll take a warrior
---
It wasn't as bad. Primarily because everybodies level of awareness about what constituted BIS, and even what loot dropped where, was far lower.
---
Was pretty much always fair game with the people I ran with.
---
Once you hit 60 you can farm dungeons. Just farm SM over and over. Or depending on class you can do Mara princess runs or something.
---
To be fair tanking with a 2h is infinitely better than using a shield
---
Thanks mate
---
&gt; If it's automatic, it'll just cut to 12s35c.
---
Wrong. Auctionator can be set to undercut by a certain percentage, 5% by default. It does not undercut by 1 copper.
---
Feral druid tank staff for magic damage fights.
---
Loot council is pretty much mandatory for the top guilds. Anyone else shouldnt bother with it unless they have an amazing atmosphere in the guild.
---
Or just keep layering so the problems are solved. A few months of layering in a game that could last a decade are laughably irrelevant.
---
Once you get higher level I recommend Hurricane for aoe packs. Pulling the AoE packs in Stratholme is so easy for bear druids if you pop barkskin and channel hurricane on them for a couple of ticks, then go into bear and start swiping. 
---
For 4-5 targets, swap targets and spam swipe. Also marking some squishy caster mob as skull and completely ignoring it while getting aggro on the other mobs is a very good strategy
---
90% of my guild chat involves punting or killing gnomes. 
---
So I think gnomes are the most hated/puntable race by both Horde and Alliance
---
It matters not who started it, i tried to be friendly but now you will feel my DoTs you mongrels.
---
But i also hate gnomes can't lie about that.
---
I don't think lowering the chance to have loot for someone who don‚Äôt raid a lot the best idea to motivate him to come.
---
Carrot work better than the stick.
---
Someone who show up at all raids is already more likely to have loot than someone who don't always show up. Adding human influence to skew the chances even more doesn't help at all.
---
I will /who the corpse before trying to res to see if 1) they are ally or horde and 2) if they are logged in. Dont like using half my mana to res someone if they arent logged in bc then the tauren shaman comes from left field and attacks me while im down
---
So, you should always be at 0 gold got it. So have 0 gold and need of every drop, but do it last just incase they greed it so you can garentee the loot. I learn alot on reddit.
---
Let the hunt...begin!
---
In vanilla some people sold their body for the epic mount
---
Thats been the majority experience for me, currently at 56. I had one bad ZF group and one bad SM GY group the rest have been pretty good. After ZF its mostly traditinal runs even if it spamming a certain thing like BRD Arenas
---
I use bartender, weakaura, and shadow unit frames
---
I disagree; the greed roll is for vendoring and disenchanting and auctioning.
---
Need is for "I am going to equip this item".

---
Hey. It sounds to me like you need to take some time at the start of the dungeon to establish roles and talk about threat management.
---
Like others have said; this is a social game.
---
Talking about it and getting everyone straight will for sure allow you to focus your healing on only the tank with an occasional tickle to a DPS class that accidentally took aggro.
---
This way you'll be above 75% mana for sure in most cases and drinking becomes a routine only post buffing or bosses.
---
Moral: Make a habbit out of talking before kicking off the fun! :-)
---
I wasn‚Äôt mad.  I thought it was kinda badass that he killed off the entire town because he wanted me.
---
So pretty much I can't go wrong from just doing what I'd normally run (I am a tank) in hopes of getting some of the good drops?
---
Instead of 1 server with 3 layers you have 3 servers with no layers. So if layers were never a thing servers populations would spread out. Its not like you have 5k friends you need to play on the same server with.
---
Well, there are some I skipped for sure, but yea I need skills from all 3 trees.  I guess that is really up to you and what you think.  I don't quite recall all the druid skills.
---
This happened too me back then. I was in full t0.5 but was passed on loot because I didn't do the damage of those  who were 5+/8 on their MC / BWL gear
---
Just its interesting to learn how the game and demeanor of its players changes so much in 25 lvls.
---
Yes, at least it does on retail as far as i know
---
I feel you OP. You‚Äôre right so I don‚Äôt know why everyone is criticizing you (probably the same people that complain about heals when they‚Äôre pulling the next mob while you‚Äôre drinking and need the mana).
---
Even if you post ‚Äúneed mana,‚Äù ‚Äúoom,‚Äù ‚Äú/oom‚Äù over and over again in the chat you‚Äôll still get groups that pull before the healer is ready. And like you said, so many people are so impatient that they won‚Äôt wait for the tank to get proper aggro, so suddenly your tank and DPS are all at 50-60% health and dropping. Not a whole lot you can do to save that without full mana. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Ask the mods. It doesn't seem to difficult to add a flair before hitting submit tbh
---
I've got some good news and some bad news.
---
Yup. If you're not willing to give someone loot, you shouldn't invite them.
---
Hi, /u/v33n33m

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da1dp8/looking_for_active_casual_leveling_guild_with/). 
---
Everyone who said "classic will be sO eAsY because gamers were bad back then" has clearly not been in any of my groups.
---
I don‚Äôt want this to turn into mod bashing, I just think our community should get a say in how the subreddit is run.
---
Ouch.. why was there even a roll to begin with lol. Shame on you Ultix
---
back then we used unstoppable force, hammer of bestial fury, end of dreams and all that. are those not viable anymore ?
---
Hmmm it‚Äôs almost like the radiant glow of the early weeks of classic are ending and it is just becoming another toxic video game that people will blind grind without concern for the community.
---
More importantly, PWS is very mana inefficient compared to your heals.  Focus on getting max value for your heal and roll a renew on the tank or any who has taken chip damage.  PWS on the AoE player is clutch as it allows them to channel more effectively.
---
As a warlock main, if I die it‚Äôs normally my own fault lol
---
That's called "Padding the Meter" in circles of people who care about DPS, and will generally get you mocked a little.
---
Your system ignores the inherent flaws of /roll 100. It does not perfectly distribute loot so someone who shows up to a raid more could win every time verse someone who shows up once in a while without ever rolling above 100. There needs to be a system to make sure the person who has won 3 pieces of loot doesnt get more loot until others get some outside of aim for set bonuses. However, person aiming for a set bonus would lose priority on non set bonus items.
---
Big tru
---
You're describing game theory and the ultimate reason that the system actually works, not describing a flaw.
---
Most people who ever played WoW didn't even reach level 10, much less level 60.
---
How is taking the boat to booty and using the teleporter more of a pain for horde? :)
---
Are we supposed to go Shield when we are "tanking" or just keep the 2H all the time?
---
The gold difference between 24 and 35 is night and day. After donating 26 gold for someone elses mount, getting nearly all my spells, doing professions the expensive way (buying cloth for tailoring, and DE'n everything I touched), even I had 20 gold at 40. But I knew I didn't need the gold for a mount because I'm a lock.
---
Someone that venders gear and skinned leather would have plenty of cash by the time they are 40.
---
i'd say not a lot. Twink is usually about having the bigger and baddest two-handed weapons, except for rogues... who don't use axes in the first place.
---
unsure I am not OP, I asked the same question he asked me in the post.
---
I Never thought of that.
---
A higher supply while the server is so fresh with gold sinks (mounts, skills, etc.) so not enough demand. Once players have more gold, then we will see an increase in material pricing as the cheap materials get bought out/used/hoarded by an AH flipper.
---
Thats some popculture reference I‚Äòm honestly not aware of :/
---
farming mara as a hunter isn't worth it on classic. Croc boss is impossible because he deals way more damage than on private servers, and princess takes forever to kill because she runs faster and deals way more damage too so your pet gets instakilled
---
Personally I‚Äôm sticking with this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVGxduio0zVZxbus while I farm my Pre-BiS prot gear. Reason being, sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind at the start of each pull deals mad AoE threat. 
---
If the mobs hit too hard for that, sweeping strikes -&gt; tab cleave works really well, then go into sunder/revenge spam.
---
I been asking my clinic if they can get some doom weed. They still wont let me back in the store.
---
&gt; People still won't see Naxx
---
Lets and wait see. I expect most somewhat serious raiding guilds to enter naxx relatively fast and down at least some bosses
---
Pos aye
---
Yeah maybe but if you have full shadow weave you're probably hardcore raiding and you need to go the ruin/demonic sacrifice setup anyways
---
I am specced shadow with points in spirit tap and sw:pain currently. And I am healing dungeons just fine also! But currently I am speccing in disc to get the mana regen and spirit buff. After that I plan to go back to shadow!
---
&gt;Using a staff gimps you no more than using a mace and there are plenty of good maces. Also polearm spec being a 25 tier talent means you can't take it and imp hamstring (that's before acknowledging that there aren't any good Warrior polearms pre AV patch)
---
There are plenty of good polearms for warriors pre IBS there's the Bonechewer and the Stoneraven to name a couple off the top of my head.
---
&gt;Using a better weapon makes a bigger difference than 3 talent points in sword/axe spec
---
Sword spec isn't worth much but 5% crit is huge and it would have to be an extremely significant damage increase to warrant taking a weapon you can't talent in to as arms.
---
Not once i was downed by his sons lollygaging around.
---
Seeing that skull was one of the trills questing in silverpines.
---
Damn it felt good to kill Arugal and take his robe.
---
Huh, wierd. I've made about a dozen groups by now that had a paid tank. At least here on Gehennas it's working well. I flist every tank advertising his services with a note on what he usually takes, create the group and look for 3dps once done and no "free" tank is available i whisper through my list and usually find one. Quick discussion with my group and then its a go if they agree. Sometimes I even pay it out of my own pocket. I rather have a tank who knows what he's doing and finishes it quickly instead of a smart-ass that insists on tanking Kirtonos or Emps in leather and deathwish. 
---
I absolutely hate standing around half an hour looking for a tank just for about 20g worth of drops. Could be farming or doing other stuff. That would easily recompense me for that.
---
Umm.. horde just teleport from Booty Bay can't they?
---
Oh it's not an advantage at all? Oh jeez nevermind then. People are just paying 5 times the sub for NO REASON. Makes sense to me. Thanks for explaining what a complete and utter waste of money it is. I can tell all the boxers to not bother.
---
Another fun one: distract makes people stand up. If you can‚Äôt kill em you can at least make em waste their water.
---
This 100%. I mentioned how absurd it was to start with so few realms, but I got downvoted to shit
---
"This is the plan, they are using name reserves to gauge interest"
---
Yeah, great plan when entire communities have to coordinate after some have already put time in the game. So many people thought this would utterly fail, including some people I had planned to play with who refused to keave herod because "hurr, every other server will be dead".
---
Yeah, I've completely given up healing in runs after SM after 4/5 of the duns have been pretty much as you described, esp if it's an melee/physical dps group with less downtime - they don't need to drink and rarely eat since they are probably expecting you to top them off - esp bad with LOLWF CRIT Shammies ripping aggro every other pull.
---
Pvp weapon
---
Despicable, wouldn't expect anything less from an Alliance rogue.
---
I am still wearing slime encrusted pads from WV. I got the staff last night from bfd! Now I need the feline pads!
---
nah i have a hunter and you cant use Intimidation while poly
---
You joke but that sub is freaking scary. I will never look at healers the same way.
---
They perform extremely well during the entire leveling. They can also tank the majority of the game in raid, and are usually the "main offtank" if it make sense for you.
---
if they can't afford it that sucks for them but the item has the same worth regardless and they weren't lucky enough to win it.  Shifting the luck from EVERYONE ROLLING WITH AN EQUAL CHANCE to x boes go to this class and y boes go to this class just created inequality.   Them not being able to afford an item doesn't make it have more value to them it still has the same value they just can't afford it and weren't lucky enough to win it.
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs too much effort, it‚Äôs that the newer folks don‚Äôt even understand flair.  They post, have their post deleted, and move on.
---
go to goldshire and start selling those cheeks
---
Because they are rare drops from elementals where spawns are often contested by people farming for the essences. You can either buy them for 10g or try to farm them yourself but it probably doesn't make much of a difference in time spent whether you farm them directly or farm gold to buy them due to the way that markets work.
---
Cooking. I think leveling from about 50 to 90. During early WOTLK when achievements first came out, there was something during Winter's Veil that required cooking and everyone was trying to level their cooking quickly. My buddies and I used to run the market for clam meat back then. We even named our guild the Clam Meat Syndicate.
---
Maxing out my professions, but mostly I'm a junkie when it comes to trying new characters and have funneled a fair amount of gold to them to get their professions started off hot. Plus I'm a hunter and I know a mount will be game changing but cheetah is nice
---
Tier 1 and a few craftable items, I presume. Google it.
---
Never pre cast a hot
---
Never pre cast pws on a war/dru tank
---
Try using greater heal pre cast and move if it‚Äôs not needed to drop heal bomb.  (Tap forward)
---
Use hot on locks when they start to tap
---
Use pws /fh on mages etc none tanks.  
---
Renew is great for  small group damage.
---
I see your point, but if they were that useless/the guild was capable without them, why bring them? Bringing them implies some value and essentially an agreement, especially as a pug, that you‚Äôll get a fair crack at the loot. Unless some other terms are met before the raid, of course.
---
Depends on the pull, and your healer.
---
If you can, using the 2h in defensive stance will be better rage/threat generation.
---
some pulls and bosses however, thing that enrage particularly, its best to have a sword and board so you can keep SB up.
---
I'd love if you gave you the option to buy tokens with Classic gold but the seller gets the gold (at a converted rate) in Retail gold.  That way you can't P2W in Classic but you also have a nice gold sink option once your epic mount is out of the way.  There's very few gold sinks in Classic aside from small minor ones like consumables and respeccing
---
So lower the price on the items ppl don't want?
---
I have used Weapon Swing Timer and it is good.
---
I use Quartz as a full cast bar replacement addon and it has a built in swing timer and that is the one I am currently using.
---
Are you talking about the axe that drops from general? That shit is garbage for warriors, it's fast as fuck and it's max weapon damage is barely more than the WW axe lmao.
---
Except it can lead to lopsided division of items which could hurt progression. If one tank gets lucky and picks up all the good items and the others run around in dungeon blues, it can hurt the group.
---
&gt;druids tend to be friendly
---
This kind of generalization is complete bullshit, btw.
---
pug,
---
Dies early contributing next to nothing,
---
Expects loot for being carried, 
---
?????
---
yea I dunno. I am same as you. Pretty much just work -&gt; dinner -&gt; wow -&gt; bed with a little bit of chores in there between wow and cooking and errands I'll during my lunch break or right after work. On the weekends, we tend to wake up early and get whatever done quickly so then we easily have a 10+ hour stretch for fun stuff, which is wow at the moment of course. One of our guildies is in uni and the dude is online all the time, lol.
---
I enjoy standing around in town, browsing my quest log and the map to play logocal ways to go about my business, planning a dungeon run in between somewhere while making sure I have al the quests and organizing my proffesions to make sure I stay up to date.
---
On top of all; I enjoy most the social aspects. Being kind to people and hoping for kindness back in the shape of new friends made each day :-)
---
If you know about it.  A lot of people have no clue what it is.  Not every subreddit uses it.
---
A bunch of servers have discord servers for all the guild leaders on the server. It's not quite everyone, but it's easy to announce to the larger guilds if someone ninjas or something.
---
Guilds won't want to have shitty people showing their tag because then it makes the whole guild look bad.
---
Are you underlevelled? 2 consc usually was enough to start hellfiring and that shit generated threat like crazy
---
Lol, you guys got pwnt
---
Clearly , but you could say this about a lot of items in the game. They will drop in price eventually
---
Redridge really does seem to enjoy its "And then go here. And then go here. And then go here" quests.
---
I like to run up to an almost dead ally just to make them fear of being ganked and then wave at them.
---
renewal cost 2g, learn it as early as possible cause the battle chicken is amazing
---
They dont have an alt, they're rolling on the BoE to sell. This is different from BoP.
---
The proud warrior of the horde I am only smashes. No talk. Only smash
---
This is a great comment and illustrates the fun in playing a druid for pvp--you need to find the form that fits the situation!
---
If you can sell the warden staff and pick up a freezing band what difference does it make WHICH BoE dropped.
---
They are interchangeable.
---
That makes no sense. There are so many reasons OP could be in the wrong, the classes are irrelevant to all of them
---
But the armorsmith quest costs a lot of resources. Even if they won't craft it for free, it's probably less than the hundreds of bars + other reagents.
---
Some priest I've played with can end a pull with more Mana than they started with last hits, good Mana management, etc. Personally I usually only chain pull if I'm only doing a few mobs at a time and can probably sustain while the priest fully drinks anyway. 
---
If a tank dies in the time you are drinking they probably suck and pulled too much anyway. Because if you are doing massive pulls the entire group should be drinking everytime anyways. 
---
But if you are needing to drink after pulls of 2-4 mobs. That definitely could be a you problem.
---
Didn‚Äôt expect to play classic. About 2 weeks out I got the itch to try it and spent a bunch of time reading up on classes and deciding what I‚Äôd like to play. Got 60 in about 2.5 weeks, been non stop grinding dungeons, clearing mc/ony, working on professions, and helping guildies with attunement and bis farming. 
---
I went from literally having zero interest to feeling like I‚Äôm 15 again. Most fun I‚Äôve had gaming in years. Now I‚Äôm just praying the ah prices will spike soon :)
---
&gt; A raid being able to kill a boss with a spec in the raid, is not what makes it viable.
---
**vi¬∑a¬∑ble** */Ààvƒ´…ôb(…ô)l/* - adj. - capable of working successfully; feasible.
---
I agree it isn't optimal to have 30 moonkins as your sole DPS source, but it's probably viable.
---
Did I say anything to the contrary?
---
How would I go about funding my servers discord? I'm horde on Skeram
---
as far as i remember the buff doesnt stack with arcane intellect anyway, so its total garbage
---
Do I need a specific Atlas part for that? I downloaded Atlasloot but can't see any maps.
---
Your post was deleted after you got that friendly PM lol.
---
this was the way I started raiding and there was zero drama with it. I ended up in a deep DKP hole because I started raiding way after everyone else. so I didn't get to roll on the stuff people who had been there for awhile wanted, and I thought that was fair. 
---
I still got the upgrades I needed to perform and stuck around to get my dkp balance back up.
---
We had a guild event this week where we were forced to organize in a raid, just so we could all be on the same layer. It is really annoying. If we had 4 more players show up, we would have had to just hope that they were lucky enough to be on the same layer as the raid lead. It‚Äôs time to peel it back.
---
It's one of the weapons used for extra armor reduction in raids, not everyone does that though, the other is Annihilator. Be careful on using weapons with debuffs because there are only 16 debuffs slots that can be used at any given time, this one has a good use but it's the raidleaders call on if you're allowed to use it

Casual, I haven‚Äôt had sex ever!
---
I don't ranged dps beyond maybe a renew after a pull.  I certainly never heal pets. I like the quickness and as long as I get full mana before a boss I'm okay with it. I think it forces you to get better at conserving mana and prioritizing when and who to heal.
---
Give me one example

But if they didn't, you would roll need?

Besides the dumbass writing of the ‚ÄúOld God‚Äù storyline, Garrosh was the best the True Horde had in Azeroth. Notice I said True Horde. As in the time of Gul‚Äôdan and Blackhand. Thrall was undoubtedly the best leader of the New Horde (post-WC2), but without Garrosh the Horde would‚Äôve fallen into shambles once Thrall decided to fuck off and do nothing for 5 x-pacs now.

tuck. It's almost 2020. They don't *make* pants that can fit junk without tucking *for years*...
---
The trick is, when you run into good people, friend them and keep running with them. I have a huge list of non guildie friends that I message when looking for a group, and I always start there first before asking in general chat.
---
"My guild ran DKP system in a dumb fucking way so its a bad system"
---
Oh cool, I didn't know you could summon Lovecraftian Old Gods in Classic.
---
Thank you. I was afraid that would be the answer. Guess I better get that knocked out now while the mats are still somewhat cheap
---
Dude there is no cross server stuff in classic except for BGs, basicly everyone who has friends playing this game choose their server based on where there are.
---
But you pretty much clear all the doable quests in STV by 34-35.  From 35-39 all the southern quests are way to hard to solo.  So, there is a huge dead zone in there.  You have to run a bunch of SM or bounce to desolace or somewhere to round out hte curve from STV.
---
What? Warrior Fury duel-wielding is not as good right now with the lack of hit% gear. 2H Fury DPS &gt; 1h fury until BWL gear.
---
Have to unsubscribe because of work/school, but I want to come back in December and keep playing.
---
Does anyone know the number of subscribers for WoW Classic?
---
Communicated beforehand is the important part. I always played solo, and when I was picked up I was always told explicitly ‚Äúguildies get the loot they need first.‚Äù 
---
But I was normally there just to experience the raids, so I was ok with that. I think I only ever got one piece of gear lol and that was because the guildie who was supposed to get it was like ‚Äúthis is an alt I don‚Äôt play much. That dude can have it.‚Äù
---
It has always been a thing, Blizzard even had to make a post about it since it was unclear in 2010 and Pugging became so mainstream. 
---
It has always been their stance, similar to how if you give someone mats for a enchant and they run off with the mats.
---
It's considered scamming as you aren't complying with the original agreed on manners. They even go in detail if master looter was given, if loot type is changed etc.
---
They have always had this as a thing and as a issue, they only recently did away with this system in BFA so they didn't have to dump resources into it.
---
Shit happened in Albion. The cockroach spy guilds all try to find parties all day every day and no one gives them the time of day because they're cockroaches.
---
LOLZOMG DAE hate [insert faction]? They ONLY kill me when there's a 5v1. Lool such pussies amirite???!!!
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs worth the same amount of gold to everyone. Which is also the case with e.g BiS BoP. It might have additional value to the player whom needs the upgrade. But it still has the same vendor price, just like the BoE free market price. 
---
The BoE will also have additional value than just the free market value. But only because 150g is more tasty than 5g the etiquette is no longer the same.
---
doesn't have to be corpse camping.  I manually estimate this stuff when I kill someone while questing and don't immediately leave the area so I can be more cautious and ready to fight around the time they're ressing.
---
Just because you THINK someone is botting doesnt make it so
---
If you knew anything about botting youd know they took a HUGE crash when BFA came out
---
Had a ninja named Heltake on Warsong during WotLK as well. Guy got such a bad name that almost the entire server /spit on him everytime he showed up. That was beautiful.
---
I have always thought there should be a "Raid Leader Loot" option to where only the Raid Leader may loot anything and then trade with whomever won the roll.
---
Shut up and take my upvote
---
What does a warrior have in that situation that makes them better aoe tanks?
---
Is it possible to get the highest level of reputation just by giving in runecloth ?
---
Same. I bought Iceborn a week before Classic. I told myself that I wouldn't buy classic, that I wouldn't succumb to the desire. 
---
To make it short, went to my brother, he let me do STV Quests with his WL, got home and resubcribed.
---
I'm weak.
---
Details! is a damage meter that also has a built in threat meter. 
---
I highly recommend it to everyone.
---
I'd say play what you enjoy or think you'll like.  Most rotations are like 3-5 buttons which is pretty simple.  It's all the fringe and situational abilities that make classes more complex, but it takes a significant amount time to level to 60 which gives you time to learn.
---
Got cha. I played like a 30 levels of vanilla as a kid and came back to playing around WOTLK so makes sense why i didnt remember that lol.
---
TY I'll try that speech tonight
---
Druid literally cannot become uncrushable since you can't block or parry.
---
Paladin technically can, but you would need to eat a crit first which would negate the entire thing.
---
Where's your unarmed weapon skill at ? It must be crazy high!
---
quest rep rewards are based on your level tho. if you're too high lvl for the quest you're gonna be getting like 2 rep per quest
---
This is how some people want to play. You want to take it slow and steady, others want to min max. I don‚Äôt judge you for that, so don‚Äôt judge me for wanting to min max :P
---
If you look closely to the sky, you can see Naxxramas floating above Stratholme
---
Distract is a little more complex than that.
---
You have to choose an area much like you would a mage's blizzard. It will cause anyone in the circle who does not resist the effect to face toward the center of the circle. The way you use it for this purpose is to stick the center of the circle in the spot you want your opponent to walk towards.
---
It has a pretty good range and does not break stealth so it's very easy to do this without being noticed.
---
Then either convince your friends to go PvE, or else make a choice. You weighed playing solo vs taking on what a PvP server means. Don't then complain that they should change what a PvP server is to cater to you because you decided to roll there.
---
Certainly not! After adding flair I receive a second PM thanking me and confirming that the post is now visible to everyone.
---
Yeah, but then the druid tank that has no intention of weilding Wardens' Staff because they'll settle for 2nd BiS is going to Need roll and then sell it.
---
I agree with you in theory, but people are dishonest af. This post being a prime example of why you *should* need roll BoE purples.
---
idk if you're trolling or what but I guess agree to disagree.  bye
---
In my case, I definitely am a speed runner. But if my priest and/or healer is &lt;25% mana I‚Äôm not pulling another group until they are &gt;75%. Generally means I can pull, and not need a heal until they hit 100% or close to it. 
---
More of a group problem imo. Speed running without waiting for mana just leads to wipes. Which leads to more downtime than just waiting for the damn regen time.
---
It sounds like you don't smash
---
U get a teleport to gadgetzan or everlook and get the jumper cables to rez. All the other items are kinda pvp items but frost reflector and so on is nice to have too. Enchanting makes u some money but only if u got good recipes and there's not too much competition
---
You know what's ironic ? I pay her sub
---
DKP with a forced minimal buy-in. If its an upgrade and no one else can use it you have to take it, not for full price but for some %. If no one can use it, then sure DE it for the guild bank. DKP isnt about just hording for one item. If you want to raid you have to get better, and a part of that is getting geared. 
---
If you refuse to improve because you want to hoard your points for that one mythical item, you're not really helping the guild you're just using it for your own gain.
---
Yep. With everyone working towards mounts at the same time, the supply is waaaaaay bigger than demand right now. Hopefully it changes once most people reach level cap on their mains.
---
Thogg not too bright but Thogg like Thogg for who Thogg is. I like him too.
---
Great point.
---
Exactly, BoE's are just a big pile of gold.
---
You can exchange them for any other BoE that your class can use.
---
When a BoE like that drops it's BiS for everyone.
---
Everyone still hates layering, and it's causing a lot of problems and exploits. People can still layer hop to evade players in PvP or any other stuff you can imagine.
---
If 10g is a huge deal for you, roll on it.
---
Can I have a drawing or something of the setup required ? 
---
Asking out of curiosity of course
---
I didn't say anybody was or was not Botting. That wasn't the point of my comment. I never posted anything saying "hey this guys Botting". 
---
&gt;If you knew anything about botting youd know they took a HUGE crash when BFA came out
---
Ok? Why does that matter?
---
The best tanks I‚Äôve run with have been breaking, telling me to drink, not me asking.  The tank should be watching the healers mana bar just as much as the healer watches their health bar.

Don't bother with slice and dice until you get garrote. Use the slowest hardest hitting main hand weapon you can find, just sinister strike and eviscerate. Gouge and bandage if you get low. And don't fight mobs above your level.

Some people are trash.

go ahead, and make those videos ! :)

Yea I don't understand why people get so upset about it. Isn't composing groups to minimize drop competition beneficial for everyone overall? If someone wants to sit there spamming channels for hours LFG how does that negatively impact you?

Yes, I have done gnomer multiple times, and with under leveled people. 
---
Having spatial awareness and erring on the side of caution when it comes to pulling is a good lesson to learn early, unless you want to wipe 5-6 times and brick all your gear.
---
Lots of 40-50 quest zones open up and now, well hopefully, that you have a mount traveling between them isn't nearly as bad.
---
With 1H you can generate rage every 1.5 sec, with 2H every 3.3 sec. + rage from dmg taken.
---
You get the same amount of rage per hit.
---
A crit gives more rage than a normal hit.
---
You are into something when you mention the dagger creating more rage than a slow 1H. Because a slow 1H SUCKS FOR TANKING. 
---
While daggers ARE USED ALOT FOR TANKING.
---
Scum
---
Sorry but that cannot work on the long run.
---
First, that would requires people to be reasonable and not rand for "upgrade" when someone would benefit more from it.
---
Second, what about that one guy that is here every three weeks, that win the nefarian sword and will actually help the guild/raid dps less than someone that is playing every single raid night of the week?
---
Any tips on button mapping?
---
Of all the loot systems that people use and have used, DKP is by far the worst of them. Rewarding attendance over skill or need is dumb as hell.
---
We... don't do it on purpose... sometimes... maybe. yes.

If you mark a skull and somebody attacks a non-skull target and pulls, just let the mob kill them. If they give you shit, just don't invite them back to a group.

it is all about know what to save and what to sell truesilver is going for 30s on shazz hell no i am AH that shit it will be way more little bit down the line and it stacks to 20. then there are things that are selling way higher than they will do mithril is super high just sell sell!

got a twink dagger that will go for 100s of gold? save that shit got the edgemasters handguards unless it means getting your epic mount save that shit.

there are items that are going to grow more than the infaltion and those items should be kept in the bank until they reach there typical level.

All of the guides recommend against Destiny because it's fast.
---
The key target weapon speed for Paladin is 3.6-3.8 sec because of some math BS that I don't quite understand. Basically, Seal of Command can only proc a maximum of 7 times so it works out that any faster than 3.6 sec won't actually get you more Seal of Command procs, and Seal of Command's base damage is 70% of your weapon damage, so the slower/stronger weapons are better -- just like the way you describe Mortal Strike.
---
Thanks for your input. I spent 50g on Kang the Retaliator so I'm glad to know that it is still a usable choice on the way to 60. I was worried that I should spend another 30-50g on something like the Twig of the World Tree.
---
Your probably dragging in the Auctioneer master folder instead of dragging in the few folders underneath the master folder
---
The way you wrote this makes it seem like you think spell power scales with int like it does in retail. Int in Classic gives you more mana and a small amount of crit, but blizzard cannot crit. 
---
Increasing your pool mana *is* more important for AOE farming than increasing health pool to a certain point, but your health does matter. When making big pulls, you take a lot of auto attacks due to melee leeway. Stam is very valuable for surviving these pulls.
---
I won‚Äôt touch retail with a 10ft pole, but the cinematics are always really good, especially this last one.
---
Druids have incredible single target threat.
---
Mages are the new huntards. Been saying it for weeks.
---
defensive stance multiplies all threat generated by 1.5x, battle/berserker stance multiplies all threat generated by .8x
---
I too go 3/5 with it.  Nice for stealth too, and I rarely have problems with agro unless I'm tanking a dungeon where I'm under lvled and miss to much.  (Lvl 47)
---
This is a thing in retail too. I'm Almost certain that your issue is 75% your own positioning. As a pack nears completion, run forwards. Get as far forwards as you can THEN start drinking, right as combat ends. Often this means you can literally stay drinking right up until the tank needs a heal, without worrying about run time because you did that during combat.
---
More important question is: Why are you ogling yeti toes?
---
It's not actually prebis for hunters btw, there's better prebis weapon options for hunters
---
There just aren't enough guilds doing MC on most servers to need to be buying/crafting alchemy pots and flasks. When more people start hitting 60 and doing MC the prices of herbs will go up because people will actually be raiding. Sure there are some anomalies right now because of server first guilds but when its spread out across more casual players, herbs and other crafting items will be way more valuable.
---
Oddly enough I‚Äôve been having way more sex since classic release
---
You just need to learn how to make friends, start conversations , join a guild . Do dungeons till you can find a good group of people to play with
---
As a Tauren, I love me some gnomes.
---
Loot council done correctly is just DKP with a bias towards guild progression - which is to say, outside of items awarded for progression (e.g. 4pc T3 for Warriors), the loot council's decision should generally be based on contribution/attendance which is exactly what DKP is designed to do.
---
There is a quest for gnomer you can get around lvl 28. It‚Äôs in the engineering hut in Org. As soon as you accept that quest another opens up from another goblin it the room. He the the one who gives the quest to go to booty bay and talk to the guy by the teleporter. Do that and you get an item where you keep in your bags and can just hop on the teleporter and you load screen in right at gnomer.
---
Not rly worth it cause baron drops one thats just a little bit less good.
---
Hell, I left my old guild for that exact reason. Random people were calling me and my friend out because our GM (warrior tank) gained the reputation of a ninja looter because he would need on every item that weren't ''needed'' because he wanted to be the first enchanter to get minor speed boots enchants to sell them at Org.
---
Came across another dude that left the guild yesterday in UBRS and apparently he was being salty as fuck because he didn't even have his 60% mount when he hit 60 lol...
---
Ashenvale is good, hillsbrad is a bunch of back and forth and can be inefficient but does have good chain quests, I'd recommend hillsbrad around 24
---
I was thinking the exact same thing!
---
Tekashi?

If ethics comes before equality then your ethics might be broken.  You want to pretend that because we don't have the ability to convert a bops value into free market gold value that we should apply the same logic we use on bops to boes.  It's asinine.  I truly believe you should think about why you have the opinions you have and what is fair versus what is just an archaic "tradition" that is unevenly applied, unfair, and creates an environment where ninjas can exist.
---
Master loot and/or social pressure.
---
That's actually a good example.

---
If I remember playing league... this was likely a ranked match in Silver AND was definitely the last win someone needed to get into Gold.
---
Any of the high level dungeons.  Strip down naked and go for a walk pickpocketing every single mob.
---
If you were properly AOE farming wouldn't you not take much damage at all? I've never mained a mage. 
---
The way I see it, a good mage has the best CC in the game, in PvP and PvE. They have so many spells which they can use to create distance between them and their target(s). Warlocks lack all of that except for fear and seduce. But warlocks also have to deal with WotF or Fear ward. And when people can get the PvP trinket it'll be even harder to create distance as a warlock. 
---
And I never said mages don't ever need stam. My argument was that stam is better for warlocks than it is for mages.
---
Yeah. I get his point but it doesn't invalidate this post as bad or unmeaningful in any way. Personally I haven't even heard of this Taladril. Ive seen people such as powerfulnoun, Ebbnflow and Skarmtank play and talk about Druid tanking. I think this is a good post and not even that over the top praising Druid tanks.
---
When he answered there wasn't an indication.

Hunter or druid on Ali works, not a significant difference between ne and dwarf for gathering.

Ah. They must‚Äôve come from greens because I done DE blues. If they don‚Äôt sell, I‚Äôm just going to use them for enchanting.

By far the most  threat  an alliance town will get on this server. Horde side is... dead...

---
The amount of pugs that have shit on reserve is astounding. I sort of understand if you have 2/3 gems from LBRS and reserve the 3rd, but to put random trinkets on reserve? Nah, you should get some friends if you want it. I also get that they are just trying to get classes that don't need it, but they could just say what they are looking for instead. 
---
People kind of suck.
---
It honestly doesn't.
---
In Vanilla, people greeded BoEs and were shamed when they did anything otherwise.  Anyone who is saying to 'need everything' is attempting to paid their wallet for their mounts.  People who 'greed all but upgrades' are focused on ensuring the run goes smoothly.
---
A lot of the redditors here are paper tigers.  I've had plenty of BoEs drop and any need rolls that are not upgrades are very rare.  Most will follow the protocol the first person who clicks.  And even then, most will greed.  It's just the courteous thing to do.  Needing everything to avoid getting screwed is saying, "I trust you to finish this dungeon with me but I can't trust you to roll properly."
---
they did back it Cata as well, happened to me. Ended up getting two of the item that was ninja'd because another guy in the party also opened a ticket on my behalf
---
Same with the stock nameplates, so far nothing seems ti fix it. Really annoying specially if you're a hunter.
---
i took my rogue into SFK at 22, gotta be a bit careful not to facepull some mobs in specific spots but you should do fine otherwise.
---
Never got around to playing WoW as a kid, and I can get the basic jist of a ninja looter, but what is happening here
---
"This class is missing utility which results in needing another dps warrior to help with sunders which means that its higher TPS AND higher damage plus additional utility to a prot warrior still makes it a meme spec"
---
God damn I played in top guilds on private servers and this thinking was poisonous as all hell. Never again. 
---
It's not a meme spec because it has a specialized defined purpose that it fits well 
---
"BUT ITS 5% LESS OPTIMAL THEN THIS PERFECT COMP I MADE UP IN MY WOW WET DREAMS!" 
---
that's not what a meme spec is.
---
Fuck off
---
if the group could finish several time the raids when everyone was in blues in the first place, then i don't see how one of the guy being ultra-stuffed will hurt the progression.
---
Heck, it make one less competitor for rolling on stuff for the others.
---
Man multiboxing is an advantage. It clearly is. Nobody would spend hundreds of dollars a month just to "play a different way"
---
I'm done here. This shouldn't even need to be argued. It's quite visibly an advantage in game, and anybody can just look at monthly sub costs and deduct that they are doing it for advantages. 
---
Goodbye.
---
Layering has tons of issues. I know plenty of people that have yet to start playing because they are waiting for layering to be removed.
---
unless you always have a leveling partner (and probably even if you do) level as ret.
---
here are your immediate goals: spec into Seal of Command, and complete the lvl 20 quest chain from your trainer that leads to the very nice two hand hammer Verigans Fist.
---
if you want to heal in dungeons you can still do that as ret. start working on an alternative set of gear with int on it, even if its cloth. only use that gear when healing for a group.
---
Strength and agility both give you attack power, and as a warrior 1 strength is effectively the same thing as 2 ap
---
FA?
---
If you don't want to train it, you can still sell the meat in the AH. It usually sells for about 200 times the vendor price: 32 silver instead of 16 copper!
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay if no one needs it to not allow pick-up payers to get it‚Äù
---
Four way**
---
How being wrecked 1v5 against multiboxer is different from 1v5 against 5 people in party?
---
Everyone is leveling / layering supply is very high for anything around level 1-40. It doesn't matter which profession you go all the lower level stuff is not worth much. a lot of stuff is actually cheaper than the material cost lol.
---
keep mining, for blacksmithing you could switch to skinning for a little bit more $ but not a ton as everyone is skinning now lol.
---
you are much better off farming gold directly by vendoring gray drops from killing mobs. young panther drops ~5s per mob, really adds up. basilisks can drop ~10s per mob.
---
Do it man. A different play style and is nice some times. You can go back and forth. No need to rush things.
---
&gt;If i raid time to time and will ALWAYS be at disadvantage against peoples who'se merit is just joining the guild before me or having more free time, why the hell would i bother raiding ?
---
Uh, because you're not contributing to the guild's success as much as people who are there for every raid? Why should you ever have an equal chance to win an item against someone who's there twice as often?
---
The whole point of DKP and similar systems is to develop an association between participation and reward; the more you contribute, over time, the more (or better) loot you receive.
---
I bought 6 months are well...... on two accounts. lol
---
Yup. I found that it¬¥s more profitable to grind humanoids that drop vendor green than farming felcloth. You get 1 gold from green armor and 3 or 4 gold for a green weapon and you can get 1g from stack of runecloth. Felcloth sells for 3g with a very low drop rate.
---
The amount of people playing the game.
---
Have the folks over at WoW HQ come up with a better loot system in retail? I haven't played in a long time. Curious if the same problem  happens over there.
---
Also saying 'ALL Greed' is the same as 'ALL Need' without the risk of a ninja. I personally hate the 'All Greed' unless you really Need standard on my server's pug runs - will eventually lead to Needing to sell instead of using.
---
But server etiquette varies, and really it should be just mentioned how to handle before the run starts.
---
Thanks
---
Dungeons with guldies and doing the quests related to them. Doing the quests in winterspring wpl+epl. By only doing this i bought devil saur mats from the ah and got my epic mount 4 days ago+ all my gear is enchanted.
---
You never need to worry about playing druid.
---
You can heal or tank all instances with almost any spec  up to 60, just with skill. The only downside is the rezz. 
---
You are rare, as druids are underplayed. I like that. Most people are surprised by what a druid can do.
---
You can be healer or tank....which helps immensely with building groups.
---
Heck, cat DPS is even acceptable when you take into account the fact that you have an emergency off tank/healer for those double pull situations.
---
I play druid and warlock and when I build groups for my warlock. I always look for at least one druid.
---
Thanks guys!  My issue was I didn't realize that I could talk to Awbee before he offered the quest.  Spoke to him, got it dialed in, and now just need to do a million rend runs to try and get the carapace :P
---
Glad to see they corrected it. This is the level of support I've usually received from blizzard so I'm glad they stepped up.
---
When you're a low to the ground dwarf, they're kinda in your face haha
---
Baron would like to have a word with you
---
I don't believe so.
---
We do know from the "Not a bug" list blizzard provided the haste bonus is actually 43% (spell cast and attack) instead of the tool tip listed 30%, scalling linearly (10% at 100% life) by 1.8% per 1% life lost until 40% where it reaches max bonus. The bonus of which remains at the value when casted, and does not dynamically change during its duration (i.e. if you cast it and then heal yourself, it remains at the value when casted).
---
One thing I've not heard word for is if it affects the "cast" time of aimed shot or slam.
---
Shaman don't have any passive mana regen while in combat, thus MP5 is very important.  Also, unless your guild is decked out many fights are longer than 1 minute and 3 minutes is probably closer to accurate.
---
I've seen Force of Will drop 3 times, HoJ, none at all.
---
obviously they're doing lowest roll wins /s
---
LOL but truth! The only time I die is from either my own User Error or the tank pulls way too much, gets steamrolled and then they roll over the rest of us lol
---
Right, but I feel like I should get used to the different utility that a more focused tank spec would offer?   
---
I mained a mage in the past and went warrior this time around for a different experience. So I have no experience end game tanking yet.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt of died in the first place?
---
Attendance is actually very important.   In most cases the skill required is a pretty low bar so attendance and practice is going to be more important for a vanilla 40 man raid.
---
So nope.  Also rolling would not lead to a more evenly geared raid.  That's asinine to suggest.
---
DKP
---
But a small price to pay for gear.
---
It's the Great Depression all over again!!!
---
Same. Grouped up for 2 mobs and the item dropped off the first. Even killed the mob myself while he was off killing another. It is what it is though.
---
Yes, paladins are at their maximum potential as a healer. Can they still do enough relevant dps? Yes, with the benefit of having buffs &amp; cleanses &amp; CDS all while having a another member's healing class with all their pros as well.
---
I did not state otherwise.
---
When applicable, I always politely ask that need rollers equip the contested loot.  Let's see how that new gear looks on you!
---
Maybe thats the intention, but I dont think the math behind it adds up. Devilsaur would be another example. While the market doesnt geht flooded with it like leather and low level minerals, its waaay cheaper than it should ever be.
---
There are too many people creating layers on low levels which in some cases increases the amount of high level materials while they dont increase the demand due to their low level.
---
&gt; is better fishing now, than it'd be by farming whatever at 60
---
spoiler, it is not
---
This person got invited to do group content with a guild (a bunch of players that play together regularly) in this group content, pieces of gear can be looted from bosses (to make your character better) but there isn‚Äôt enough for everyone. Those who can use the loot roll for it. OP got the higher roll and assumed they would get the loot. However, the guild gave it to the other person (who I assume is in their guild). Op claims this is because they died early in the fight (These group encounters usually last several minutes). 
---
So that leaves two perspectives:
---
OP: Feels they should get the loot because they went and even though they died, they still went to the group event.
---
Guild: Feels that OP went but wasn‚Äôt a meaningful contributor the the group. Dying early essentially meant that they did it all without him. This lack of participation due to dying should, in their eyes, forfeit any opportunity at the loot from the event.
---
Hope this explains it.
---
Ive mastered making people miss getting off the boat if they hesistate
---
meta on Kurinaxx? Sup guildie
---
Mages a weird lot.  I've encountered many asshole mages and at the same time I have guildy mages that are asshole because of how they're treated and they got fed up.  I've had more than a few mage guildies, more than a few times, saying some random stranger just /whispered them asking for a port to a town or food/drink.  And the person isn't actually in a town, they're in a zone 2 FPs and a boat ride away and expect the guildy to go to them and when they don't they rip into them about being selfish.  
---
I wonder how many mages started the game as asshole or became assholes because of the game.
---
alternatively:  virgin brother and sister suicide pact
---
Or just make it known what loot is reserved for guildies when you're advertising for pugs, that way people can decide if they want to join the pug or not.
---
I try to do that! But they outlevel me so damn fast, they must be playing for 8 hours straight everyday. I ran RFC with an amazing tank from the first guild I was in, now I'm 38 and he's 58. That level gap just causes you to stop being friends after a while
---
yo tell me all you know about it. Even if you write a 2 pages long essay ill read it all lol. PVE and PVP. How does it compare with Shamans (resto/ele)/druids (resto/balance)?

No, it would make more sense to have a 2h arms tank who can actually hold aggro with a SS WW and still top the meter
---
It‚Äôs not a delusion, it‚Äôs how it is in classic servers. Everyone knows everyone.
---
I liked the system we used. You could shroud, standard or save bid. If people shroud however had the highest points paid half their points or 10 points whichever was higher. You had to have at least 10 points to shroud. If no one bid shroud than it went to a /roll between the people who bid standard and whoever won the roll got the loot and paid either 10 points, or all their points (if they were less than 10.  If no one standard bid than it was a roll off between the people who bid save with the item costing the winner 10/all their points. You could never go negative.
---
I liked this system as it made it so you could save for the pieces of loot you really wanted but no one could ever get so far ahead in points that they won everything. Likewise you could never so far behind in points that you couldn't win anything. It also made a great system for allowing people who were new to the guild to still get gear even if they couldn't get the most desirable pieces right off the bat as all as a good system for people who wanted offspec gear. It also rewarded people spending points so you didn't okay gear that people might have been able to use sitting to rot so people could save for BiS.
---
False.
---
Never knew about this, thanks man.
---
You can also try chatting up support ‚Äì I know they helped my friend after a ‚Äì quite big - jump from X58 to Z390 platform. They just remoted in, went through the exact troubleshooting wizard and just generated a new key for him. ;)
---
&gt;unless you are a pala/feral tank. Or a shaman dps..or...
---
All of those things are perfectly viable in 5mans and PvP. It's raids where they're bad.
---
Again, if you want every single spec to be 100% viable at everything, go play retail and enjoy the homogenization. When everyone is super, nobody is.
---
&gt;Blizzard learned and saw the errors - and fixed some of this in tbc.
---
Exactly, you don't want "classic+", you want TBC.
---
This is good advice. Arms is better while leveling and tanking dungeons. Tactical mastery is so important
---
so much of this is just wrong
---
the only reason youre ever a centerpiece is because you might be tanking the flag
---
if youre arms, your group is better off without you generally, or youre there **STRICTLY** for the mortal strike debuff on kill targets. Youre the centerpiece because without multiple people supporting you then you literally cannot even move and you have nothing else of use so they support you to debuff the kill target. Nothing more. 
---
DPS is on par with other pure dps classes. Perhaps late end game they pull ahead a bit, but like rogues, theyre limited by many fight mechanics. 
---
&gt;But in a group setting with proper gear you become an unstoppable force in PvE as well as in PvP
---
just false. A mage can do more. More burst dmg. More survivability. And infinity more utility. 
---
APEs uses warriors because of main tank and fury dmg. That's it. If blizzard didnt make block so critical to fighting end-game bosses, Paladins and Druids would be the superior tanks. The reason warriors are the only end-game tank is that shield block is an on-demand spell for warriors and for paladins its a proc. It's tough to tank large bosses doing crushing blows at critical moments when youre hoping for a proc. In every other way through paladins and druids are better ranks because in every other situations they have way better AOE threat which matters a lot. If the boss isnt gonna crush you, the mitigation difference between the classes is negligible. 
---
Shield block and fury 1h dps is all that's keeping warriors relevant in PVE (because deathwish is a really good spell), and mortal strike is the only reason groups bring a warrior to pvp. In every other way they're trash. 
---
Mages are also more popular that warriors right now as a pure dps class... because theyre **TOO GOOD**. Mages need hard nerfs and they'd still be the best. Theyre a massive outlier.
---
Open a ticket, attach screenshot and tell them to check their logs. If they have not locked the item you should get it via gm
---
That's why I played so many alts on retail. I can never figure out exactly what I'm supposed to be doing once I hit max. I'm stuck in the old mindset of "run dungeons to get gear to run harder dungeons to get gear to run raids" but I don't think that's the efficient path anymore. It seems like it's now "do this solo content in hopes the rewards lolotteries into BiS raid gear". In Classic, the path seems so much more defined. That appeals to me.
---
Agreed entirely.
---
This is exactly what happened in retail and battlegrounds killed WPVP forever, and look what happened to that.
---
The game has the word WAR in it with 2 opposing factions for god sake lol.
---
Nah, they're angry children whose parents didn't want a cat do they decided to become one instead.
---
The lvl 60 5 man dungeons are some of the most fun in the game. And there are a lot of them. I don't get this.
---
Most somewhat serious raiding guilds will be farming BWL since phase 3 week 1 and ad40 since phase 5 week 1
---
APES killed almost every boss in sub 1 minute in full greens and tons of sub-60s. I guess we will see.
---
Thanks gonna check it out.
---
Ok and are you trying to say that‚Äôs even close to arcane explosion spam LOL
---
&gt;And we gave our free water and food and buffs with no request for a tip.

That's a quick trip to a party kick and ignore list.
---
Maybe he likes to look pretty while ganking!
---
Yeah every time I decide to go play I just get camped by 10 horde chillin inside stormwind and when I ask for help everyone just tells you to turn war mode off.
---
Absolutely. I'm trying to say that need&gt;greed convention, perfect for BoPs, breaks down when dealing with BoEs.
---
The RL linked loot and people rolled on it. Even the guy who got the loot. The intention is clear because even the involved parties acted in the exact way you‚Äôd expect in normal rolling.  
---
If it‚Äôs reserved, why link it? If it‚Äôs reserved why is the person it‚Äôs reserved for rolling?  
---
You don‚Äôt need crystal clear breakdown of rules, because it‚Äôs clear what happened here. And if there is a crystal clear reservation in place, it should be said somewhere in raid prior to the misleading loot rolls.
---
new canon, Windfury is an Old God

After 12 years of playing, if there's one thing I've learned it's how to make friends. But people don't seem to care either way. They just seem to take everything for granted as if I didn't just go out of my way and spend 10 minutes helping them with something. If I see people that I've run across before, or guildies out in the world, always /wave or say "hey :D". Nobody ever responds. They're too caught up in their leveling and focused on the next thing to do to give a shit
---
eh, i like to give the benefit of doubt. I (enh sham) got ravager on my second SM Arms run at lvl 35 in a group with 2 warriors and another shammy. Everyone else greeded it so I got it ezpz. Very possible for a hunter to acquire it the same way.

What tank can cast arcane explosion retard?

&gt; here is no other **tanking ability**

With spotty evidence and no context.

Assuming your going ‚Äúdungeon prot spec‚Äù. It‚Äôs litterly the exact same rotation but you throw in shield slam on CD, will have last stand to use when needed and a stun when needed.
---
Do you understand the concept of expected value?
---
Leader deserves a fucking perma-ban.
---
Honestly I can't tell if Mages are Warriors are the more idiotic of the classes in Classic.
---
You hold out, and if other people are holding out then you say ‚Äòall need roll.‚Äô
---
The guy won‚Äôt get the item, but they may strip it from the guy who didn‚Äôt win the roll.  
---
Nothing to lose by opening a ticket for a legit concern.

Wrong. Only hunters, rogues and cat form druids gain melee AP from agility.

Back in vanilla all rogues were the fuckwits (not all you lovable sneaky stabby maniacs)
---
Now i see way more mage/warrior idiots then ever before
---
green means the mobs you have to kill are below your level, yellow means around your level, orange means above your level and red mean way above your level.
---
Killing green mobs is the most efficient means of questing. you miss green mobs less and they miss you more.
---
I‚Äôm just raising a thought. You have absolute no idea about my ethics, opinions nor way of following old traditions. I haven‚Äôt stated anything about my personal standpoint.
---
A lot of people might argue that BoE or BoP doesn‚Äôt matter, upgrades will always counter sell value. You seem to disagree, which is fine. But I think you are missing the point. 
---
 Anyways, you as a person easily falls into the idea of a single-player, narrow minded person. You will have more success if you try to understand different perspectives in life. 
---
Good luck with everything.
---
You still can make a decent profit as alliance. Just sell them for 35s per 5 on the neutral AH. Horde will buy them and flip them.
---
his social life is vibrant
---
Agility doesn't give warriors AP.
---
I'm snickering because of the warlock comment!! Heck, I must be warlocking wrong because I havent ever life tapped past 70% health in a dungeon! Priest and warlock, I see trying to drink, mage not so much. Mage seems unwilling to give out water too, and the only warlock I've encountered in a dungeon to hand out healthstones is ME! XD Shaman healer always needs to drink but I hardly ever see them drink! And we die lol.
---
I do agree with you; with the pug groups I've been in, everyone DOES go ham, and I'm on an rp server! They have the retail mentality where they think they can run and kill, run and kill. It's sad because it is a different game with a different mindset. I utterly dont understand the people saying this isnt happening; y'all been lucky with your pug groups ü§£
---
I've been wearing a stupid (just kidding, AWESOME) cloth wizard hat since level 32. I've upgraded every other slot at least twice since I got it.
---
I'm a level 52 hunter.
---
I say a prayer every time I hit character select for a mail helm with more agility to drop
---
Hear hear!
---
Tries to take item (and succeeds) out of spite for the other player, when he shouldnt.
---
I'm pretty sure the GMs will always act to rectify issues caused by people going back on promises made or deals struck.
---
&gt; hunters should be soloing Mara
---
How I do dis?
---
If someone jumped into guild chat yelling "Dont group with 'X', they're an &lt;asshole/ ninja looter/ bad player&gt;" my internal response would be:
---
"Bummer".
---
I would then proceed to completely forget the players name, crime, and very existence.
---
I doubt other people are a whole lot different.
---
Good God how young are you?
---
I know exactly how Int works in Classic. You do recall having shatter as well as casting cone of cold (which can crit), yes?
---
as long as you don't steal skins from your own faction you're fine
---
Not really, trolls also like the alliance races. Especially barbecued with some herbs.
---
His fault for not dropping a trap, seriously. My buddy is level 52, a hunter with much experience in this. God damn near every mob he drops a trap behind him, if he even gets a whiff of ally in the area.
---
Skinning without dropping a trap? Noob hunter. I aint even mad lmao.
---
It's not available yet.  Phase 2 I believe.
---
So, in theory, you could technically replace all the sounds in the game with that sultry seductress snapping her whip and moaning?
---
Yeah, I know. But there are options for hunters that actually provides very similar dps stats. Warriors only got this and Ironfoe :S And ironfoe is not realistic. 
---
And tbh, its such a huge difference for warriors and rogues compared to hunters.
---
I just blame myself for not informing him about this. No hate towards hunters, just a joke. :)
---
Shrug, to me it's not as important (or important enough to be dicks to other people about it) when we literally knowing what's coming after this - especially since there's a real chance future raids come at an accelerated rate.  I raided up until Naxx back in vanilla and loot was a much bigger deal to me back then because we were doing progression raiding and loot came much more slowly (full 40 mans)
---
Doing fine! Are you already attuned to onyxia and MC? Doing those require you to run a couple instances anyways, and you might get even more upgrades.
---
What class/spec are you?
---
Seems about right. I am 4/17 at 58 and most of my bis are in ubrs. Haven't even ran scholo, strath or lbrs yet
---
Really well done!  This was awesome.
---
You get it. We didn't have disputes often but it was nice for people to have somewhere to go, besides reddit.
---
Probably my favorite raid ever honestly, it was just really cool aesthetically. Loved the open layout and as someone who didn't raid during Vanilla getting to take down Raggy was awesome.
---
I'll never be unsubbed. I have too much fun even hopping on random lowbie alts and playing for a bit. Plus I want blizzard to know I love this direction of bringing back older versions of the game so I'm voting with my wallet.
---
I'm glad you got that dealt with, but I'm mystified as to why they don't just stick some invisible walls around the roof if they don't want people there.
---
Hey I‚Äôve been searching for a good energy ticker addon, which one is this?
---
And they tossed in a free month? Kudos very nice.
---
Corpse Camp timer eeh?  
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt be too hard since you could easily acquire the point of death and point of respawn and just figure out the movement speed. The hard part id imagine is terrain would be hard to calculate. The best thing you could do is figure out the fastest respawn time because after that it‚Äôs all up to chance. Like player instantly running to his grave, instantly respawning, always running in optimal path. It‚Äôs not even worth calculating terrain but just giving fastest time someone run in straight path.
---
I really hate brd. so much so that I'm still not onyxia attuned but i really need to do it in the next few days rip
---
Well Blizzard kept rolling out a high ILVL BoE gun every expansion with tank stats from the high end raids....
---
They DEFINITELY did it for the meme. Those goddamn things were better than the pre-raid and low tier raid BiS with the sheer damage on them...
---
It's 2019, it's a lot harder to have a consistent 40 man group
---
I think you should raid MC with 40 warriors if they're so strong mate. Can't even have a discussion with you, it's just "rogues suck"
---
You can‚Äôt.  Blizzard has locked the function.
---
What mod is it that is notifying you that Stealth is ready?
---
Also when you have a chain run group like this - take take roll once and 'turns' on who gets rings drop instead of having 1 person get screwed by RNG.
---
What I mean by turns is people will eventually leave esp if they got their Ring, so any new person that joins moves to the bottom of the list of who gets the Ring next. But yours sounds like they stuck with it for 5 runs after they got ring, so good on them for that.
---
Sorry my bad, agility gives them crit chance and ranged ap. Not melee AP, I misread
---
ItS gOoD bEcAuSe ItS pUrPle ThO
---
Damn thats fucked up, I remember stuff like this back in the day. I don't play wow anymore. This kind of stuff would have stressed me out so much cause I would feel like I wasted my time.
---
MC attuned, on test of skulls for Ony.
---
Frost/mage
---
That's pretty much what the potion is. You both need it to talk.
---
Prob be there until Tuesday
---
fyi rivenspike doesnt stack with faerie fire. the only weapon that does is annihilator
---
&gt;By raiding more often than someone, you already have more chance to win the items you want already.
---
Yeah? What about the person who skips progression and shows up for the kill? Should that person have an equal chance at the best loot from the tier despite not putting in anything close to the same time as people who've been there throughout?
---
Absurd. What a ridiculous sense of entitlement you have.
---
Oh I know that one - me, my friends and goblins.  Just another form of economic PvP :D
---
I think we lucked out pretty good. Reasonable horde/alliance ratio compared to a lot of servers and lively even with the layering without having to waste all night in queue.
---
Are you perhaps illiterate? Where did I state that I joined any of those groups? The only thing I expressed is my annoyance.
---
I did have someone who tried to steal my Echeyakee... got a ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù which was a little obnoxious. Luckily I was playing with my brother and he had a spare horn.
---
&gt;You're basically like the women who cry rape when they were the ones who got drunk and made a bad decision. SMH.
---
That's a big yikes from me dawg
---
Make sure that combat abilities are put on a keybind. You can and should reconfigure the default bindings and set keybinds to the additional actionbars as well.
---
I especially like the buttons near WASD and also use the Shift and Alt modifier.
---
We are waiting for two related events -&gt; people leaving low-level zones (decreasing supply of low level materials), and people with money starting to level professions and alts.
---
I expect the first to start happening within the next month or so, while alts/twinks/professions will take a while longer.
---
Ah. Makes sense.
---
use the highest dps weapon when leveling. train several weapon types and level them up with random drops you get so that when you get a new weapon you dont spend a long time having to level that skill from 1.
---
the racial weapon skill issue is fairly minor while leveling and can be ignored.
---
Remove curse has no cd.
---
One of my most prominent memories from vanilla leveling was running around in Felwood as my hunter, a higher level druid comes by and roots me, stands in my dead zone, and kills my pet. Nothing I could do about it but sit and watch. After my pet died I just stood there not really knowing what to do next. Druid mounted up and left....
---
Exactly... it‚Äôs not complex just a massive gear check.
---
You're doing fine and better than average. BIS is sort of subjective and depends on class/spec, since some gear is has no substitutions, and others BiS can be subbed out with green BoE's.
---
I think is either being 6 or 7 levels higher than the mobs, they will turn grey to you and I will not award xp. Its the same with quests, once they turn grey you will get a tiny fraction of the xp/reputation they award. 
---
So when you see a green quest in your log book, just know that in few or less levels it will turn grey.
---
At 60 (or once you start brd really) you tank as prot. Fury is a spa spec. 
---
Leveling as arms is the way to go. You miss too much if you dual wield.
---
&gt; If you were properly AOE farming wouldn't you not take much damage at all? I've never mained a mage.
---
No. Even playing very well, you can take a decent chunk of damage every time you re-nova. This is mainly because of melee leeway.
---
In addition, things can go wrong in pulls. A couple mobs might resist a nova (1% chance no matter how much hit you have) or seemingly heartbeat out of one early. Having a greater health pool in these situations can allow you to tank more damage while cone of cold kiting before you can re-nova and keep the pull going. 
---
&gt;My argument was that stam is better for warlocks than it is for mages.
---
My argument is that it's actually not at this stage of gearing.
---
You can‚Äôt ever fully avoid shitty people, but if you give up looking for good people because of shitty people, you‚Äôll never find them.
---
I don't know, I see a ton of "Go back to Retail" /yell spam and that's just with the translation add-on. I'd hate to see what they say if there was an actual common language. Of course it would still probably be better than Barrens political chat.
---
Imo the only profession you need based on professions is argent dawn for access to naxx. As an enchanter I‚Äôm pre grinding it to revered before phase 3 and timbermae to honored but that‚Äôs because I want the enchants early.
---
What server are you on? 
---
I find this a challenge too. What few WOW friends I made in Vanilla I've lost touch with. None of my real life "friends" play video games.
---
I played on a PServer January through July this year with a great group of people. I connected with two players, and very intentionally spent multiple sessions helping them level, quest, or catch up. But if I didn't reach out, I would almost never hear from them (either on Discord or in-game).
---
Just my story. My situation is different from most. Just thought I would share it with you.
---
What a miserable group of people you must play with.
---
I farmed for ashes of al'ar in WOTLK with some people and invited a random level 70 to tag along so he could get some epics, I told him very clearly that he wouldn't be allowed to roll on the mount, Of course it just had to drop that run and when it dropped he still did a /roll, I took it and he opened a ticket and was given the mount while it was taken from me
---
Had to open like 3 tickets to finaly get a GM with a brain to get it back even though i clearly stated he would not be allowed to roll.
---
So it's not really flawless even if you do type in the rules.
---
My feelings exactly
---
Swamp of Sorrows isn‚Äôt even that sad.
---
Yes, warriors need on everything that they MIGHT use. Did a full brd and I think the warrior needed on 3-4 weapon drops, for OS or some shit. Might full the other 3 in group but I know you vendering for that juicey gold.
---
I did the whole thing with the succubus in OG vanilla, and frankly it sucked. It was the part of the leveling experience I hated most.
---
If you're rolling with your VW, you should easily be able to handle 3 mobs at once with VW, fear, and your face + Drain Life. I still recommend getting Fel Concentration and going down the Affliction Tree to SM. Siphon Life is good, but I don't think it should fundamentally change everything you do the way others seem to think so.
---
If you don't respec, you can get 4/5 Fel Concentration, which is still nice. You really don't need to take Dark Pact unless you're dead set on doing the succubus game plan. You can still do perfectly fine without it as long as you're good about Life Tap and Drain Life. Once you have Shadow Mastery, Drain Life heals more health than its mana cost, meaning you come out a net positive on resources.
---
[This is my "core" talents through level 39 for warlock leveling.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5502203500201005) I generally think the range increase is lower in my priority than everything else.
---
From here, you can either go into Destruction and essentially set up the SM/Ruin spec if you want to run a lot of dungeons, [like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5502203500201005--54500051000001).  Similar to affliction, I think the increased range talent is quite overrated. Improved Firebolt is a major trap. Your Imp is going to run itself out of mana no matter what. All this will do is make that happen sooner. You'll get the same amount of damage done, because it'll end up waiting for mana regen ticks earlier than without the talent.
---
You'll still want to minimize how much you Shadowbolt in the world leveling, but using your Nightfall procs is more than fine and you can still afford to actually cast one as your resources allow. Again, remember that we can transfer HP to Mana 1:1 but eventually can transfer mana back to HP at a more favorable ratio through Drain Life.
---
Alternatively, you can go into Demonology just to focus on the grind, [like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5502203500201005-20503001505). Your VW will be a bet better at everything a VW does, and you'll be focused more on the solo leveling gameplay. Fel Domination I think is very worth it, as sometimes it adds efficiency in cases where your pet dies. Sometimes it even becomes more efficient to just resummon your pet after combat anyway with this spec.
---
Lmao your guild can't even find 40 people to fill a raid and decided to ninja from someone you invited to the raid. If your gonna be scummy at least own it.
---
Yup I‚Äôll be going deep prot for MTing raids. 
---
(11/5/35) https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LV0xzZVZeizse0zVo
---
All else being equal, Salvation would be the tie breaker for pve raid effectiveness.
---
Dude...that's fucking APES.  Most guilds still haven't even downed Rag.
---
Agreed lol. And I was on surprises side in the original thread lol.
---
It makes me think that this was mostly a guild run and that there were alternative loot rules set up prior to the formation of the raid. But OP provides little in the way of information so who knows.
---
It might be, since apparently they aren't reddit nerds because they're too busy with their real life girlfriend jobs
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Don't both of those fights have add phases? WW+Cleave as already stated
---
or DID they?
---
Are warriors not affected by the speed normalization brought about in patch 1.10?
---
It seems like most pickpocket guides from classic are no good. Pickpokceted BRD like on youtube, most gold I got off a single mob was like 6 silver. Most about 2 silver. So for every 10 mobs I made 20 silver... not worth it imo. I also didnt experience any of these BoEs dropping from pickpocket.
---
I want Classic+. I do not want flying either.
---
TBC wasn't homogenized. Wotlk had good class difference as well and addes signature spells we all know today.
---
Anyway: we assume people have one main. They 'are' a paladin. Them not being viable in a raid isn't related to pvp at all. They are very different from warriors as is so even changing NOT BEING RAPED by bosses won't change that.
---
Tailoring allows you to craft and wear the Robe of the Void, although it is very expensive and not a large upgrade over the Robe of Winter Night which is BOE and can be worn by anybody. When Zul‚ÄôGurub comes out, the Bloodvine set will be available which is BIS for a decent length of time. Bloodvine is also BOE and can be worn by anyone, but it has a 2% crit set bonus that you need tailoring to receive. Right now the biggest ‚Äútryhard‚Äù play would be to level tailoring, make a Robe of the Void, and then drop it for something else until ZG comes out and leveling it again, but I don‚Äôt think most people need to go to that extreme.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16l2kJPM0D0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16l2kJPM0D0)  1:10 too close to crocos on classic you would get hit from all. when you hit them with slow.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unusjpGt8bY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unusjpGt8bY)  at 0:40 when he iceblock, they are so close to him, without any hitting him, and when he goes out only 25% hits him, here they would reset their swing timer, and all hit you if you dont blink out.
---
If anyone is interested I have more content like this on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgdyswgFk7pcF6SFcNaWthA
---
It‚Äôs old Joji. He used to go by the name filthy frank. He was a funny and edgy youtuber who would dress up in a pink morph suit and call himself ‚Äúpink guy‚Äù. He made a whole album as pink guy but it was satirical. Now he‚Äôs Joji and he only makes music and it‚Äôs serious music
---
It's the tragedy of the commons in action.
---
Most people would justify their need roll on something they don't need as a defensive tactic, one where they would get screwed by a ninja who did the same thing.
---
The trick is, what if everyone in the group thinks that way? Also, seeing as BoE's can be traded, in your own head "whats the harm if I roll need, I know that if I get it, and someone who really needs it in the group makes the case that they would equip it, I might give it to them."
---
At the high level, the amount of gold this represents means the stakes are higher, so people quite often just roll need on all BoEs in PUGs and that's just how it goes.
---
Lots of guild + pug groups are stand-up, though.  I've been in two already and nothing bad went on.
---
Good luck setting up a rend run as a dps without people that can use swords though. Finding a Druid tank and all cloth and shaman dps and healer group that doesn't mind insane loot competition doesn't sound easy.
---
If that works for you, sure. Me, I still prefer the better performance in a group setting and fighting mobs over getting there a little faster for a few levels. Its not as if half your spellbook is totally useless, so its a compromise either way.
---
Hey everyone, OP is a big phony!
---
Nah just kidding, good job on the quests üôÇ
---
You know what?  My experience has been the complete opposite.  As far as community is concerned, you do get out what you put in, so the first question would be how seriously have you really tried to interact with other players?  If they are all quiet and you are quiet too, then you can't really complain too much if all you see is "ty" etc.
---
I'll say things like " I only need x mobs for my quest, how many do you need?"  I'll even say that I'll stick around to help after.  Usually that emboldens people to speak up.
---
He'll just the other day I said to someone to add me as a friend and if we're still in level range we can join up and quest.  You know what?  He was really appreciative of even such a gesture.  
---
I guess the point is that people will communicate if you give them the chance.
---
100% of the time
---
Probably to make us feel less bad when we see $15 a month transactions going back over a decade. 
---
Wow, XBL, Spotify at this point are included as ‚Äúbills‚Äù haha
---
It works for progression guilds because they are there for the purpose of progression. They want to be the world first or whatever, loot is secondary. For the other 99% of players loot is the primary goal of playing.
---
if it was then it's fantastic. still a great pasta.
---
Just focus on stat sticks.  Honestly some green 2 handers/staves of the monkey/bear/tiger are decent enough for leveling.
---
One of our tanks does runs in exchange for the run-ees passing the greens and blues that anyone doesn't need as an upgrade. He makes absolute bank and people don't even feel like they're missing out on the 1-3 greens they may have gotten in a run just so they don't have to look for a tank all day.
---
I suspect it's a typo from OP.
---
I agree that the obsession with getting pre raid BIS is ridiculous (especially with how many items are out there that are good substitutes and much easier to get). But if you're not tanking, you really don't need to think about resist gear in MC. What you get from class buffs is plenty. If you've got a group of 40 people playing semi optimally, you'll absolutely melt MC.
---
Sure, shatter can be useful when AoE farming. Int gives a very small amount of crit comparatively. Most AoE farms also rely on blizzard but some mages prefer to farm with FS, CoC, and AE. Those mages still prefer to reach a certain threshold of HP.
---
Where are you going with this?
---
So if a healer dont heal a dps lets Say a rogue who then dies instantly on ragna fight that means even if he win rolled the dagger he cant get it because he got carried?
---
 Even when he cleared  the whole raid with them?
---
This is just bullshit
---
That's what you read?      
---
Then you need to grow up.      
---
I'm saying the DATA doesn't support your alternative reality.        
---
Warriors can do just as much damage as a rogue,  can wear plate, can use axes..     
---
I'm saying that Blizzard is allowing Warriors to marginalize rogues, and that's a problem.       
---
When your raiding guild has 1/5 Rogue to Warrior ratio; you would think GOOD,  I can get gear easily.   Wrong.   Fury Warriors take the same BIS items as Rogues.
---
I was able to tank every dungeon with a standard 31/20/0 spec and then respec'd deep prot the day of my first MC raid. I will say though, it is a whole lot easier to hold aggro as prot so if you are you just going to tank dungeons all the way to 60 then I would respec. I only stayed arms so I could do quests and farm leather via skinning (which I also dropped now for Engineering).
---
Right around where op is
---
Every MMO allows multiboxing. You don't know what you are talking about.
---
Time to come back ashore Capt. Ahab...
---
They should make dedicated multibox servers and ban it on the rest of the realms. I'm fairly confident very few would play on them. The whole point is to get an advantage over regular players.
---
They are paying to get things done faster, or easier than others. It's pay to win. They pay more, for an advantage.
---
Swamp of sorrows isn‚Äôt even that sad.
---
Yes. 
---
I made a character with my husband in Grobbulus. He didn‚Äôt want to play as often as me, so I made a hunter alt to play. 
---
That hunter joined an awesome guild, and now he‚Äôs my sort of main. Then I made a rogue on Deviate Delight, to see if that community was better/worse. Joined an awesome guild. 
---
Now I have a Warlock(22), a Hunter (30), and a Rogue (24).
---
Ok retard. You lose aggro to mages. MAYBE you hold it on like some pussy 5 pull.
---
Tailoring is the best by far for your bis robe and later on bloodvine will be bis. Otherwise I would go engineering or mining, it's probably too late to make money off enchanting I would just make a disenchanting alt.
---
As for spec, affliction makes life way easier leveling and is fine in dungeons. Destruction might get slightly higher dps in 5 man's in 30s/40s but leveling will be much harder.
---
"better for the economy" 
---
Lol what?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/da1vzz/official_response_from_surprise/?
---
A stack of thick sells for 1g35s+ and a stack of rugged is 1g50s on my server. It's just a little bit of passive gold while leveling that I won't turn down and when I drop it for alchemy at 60, I'll just powerlevel it with all the herbs I've been banking because they sell awful right now.
---
Youknowme, Heltake, how do you guys remember the name tags of shitty gamers you met 10-15 years ago?  Do you guys have a Book of Grudges or something?
---
Those groups sound pretty cancerous tbh
---
Greed is for everyone, if you need it for your main spex, then roll need, simple as that.
---
Yes, there are and most of them involve having a certain select number of items rewarded via loot council.
---
Anyone else had their addons deleted with this update? Wtf..
---
imagine thinking this will affect them at all
---
Ok I have my lock at 60 and when farming, I have tried this rotation many times, send the void or succ in, wait for taunt or lash to go off, then do the above rotation, drain life always results in me pulling aggro.  Drain soul does not.  Wand results in aggro too.  It seems in order not to pull aggro with drain life I have to wait for 2 taunts or cut one of the spells from the rotation.  Any advice?
---
You must be popular with the Lews Therin bot on /r/wetlander humor, Mierin Eronaile
---
Id rather they just made important npcs unkillable than make the dks. Dks mean anyone who wants to rank wont go near a city. Once you go in as a raid, a billion guards spawn. Now you have to aoe them down which is almost guaranteed to have civilian npcs caught up in it.
---
Went they all Hunter weapons?
---
&gt; real life girlfriend jobs
---
Genuine lol at this.
---
This bright white block on the bottom of your post speaks to me. It says "u/zappyspocket doesn't know how to resize/crop his memes when he ctrl-vs them into paint so as to avoid including the bright white background paint has there by default."
---
Runecloth is just for major cities right? Is there any benefit of getting those reps to exalted if you don‚Äôt want the mounts?
---
Sorry for the semi off topic question, I‚Äôm just sitting in stacks and not sure what to do!
---
The totem slot is so underutilized in classic.  Maybe classic+ could add a low-ish level class quest reward totem that boosts armor by a % and redirects fire totem threat to the shaman?  Max rank ES is pretty much a taunt already...
---
Well, we do have a full 40 man raid roster..
---
But it has happened to me before, and as I said ofc it sucks, but I did understand them.
---
The mace from princess and the axe off croc in maraudon are both slight upgrades. At 60 you should be gunning for pre-bis imo, which is dalrends for DW or some 2h off last boss in UBRS for 2H.
---
Very nice
---
MC is an easy raid. It becomes an issue when the ret pally that took gear from others reaches AQ40. At that point they are beyond deadweight but still have gear that other classes could be using
---
Unfortunately yes. 
---
22 Priest

16 Warrior

14 Druid

12 Paladin

In general, I am quite interested in guild management and in governance in general - and I make a note of stuff like this when i encounter it, and i sadly dont find this to be all that uncommon.
---
Uncommon is sadly not all that positive either, because guilds, for a number of reasons, thrive with having a broad and representative management core (much like we do in other communities), and solidifying too much power into a single position, is often not good.   
---
To be fair, this can all work out just fine,  its just not ideal - having a specific head of recruitment, that is aware of the guild needs, is passionate about "guild HR" and who is focused on one key task, would be much better. So would it be, to have one or two dedicated raid leaders, or a single overall leader to break ties and maintain strategic decision making.   
---
For guilds, i tend to favour having 5-7 officers besides the GM, who are all focused on specific tasks within the guild and who are broadly representative of the member-base, especially in Loot Council based guilds. More often than not, this is sadly not the case, so you have to be prepared to compromise.
---
Phase 2 as it requires Dire Maul
---
I feel it too, it's taken me until level 30 to finally start and get used to where the ranges are for nameplates showing up vs where I can shoot at things. It's not ideal, though it is nice knowing that I can stand outside the range others can see nameplates at and unload! :)
---
So that's why Teldrassil was so flammable
---
Here he had whoppin' 74% chance to succeed though. Ninja rarely gets this good odds to look legitimate!
---
With Dwarves it really depends on the choice of character face for me. If it's one of those crazy eyed dwarf it's 100% some kid who will corpsecamp you for hours while jacking it to animal cruelty.
---
You can't just "create layers". That's not how this works at all.
---
I take immense pride in being a Druid, but I'll be damned if I haven't had a single fucking Druid, horde or alliance, return my salute since day one.
---
Thogg no healer, Thogg no kill

Did you try your server subreddit or discord?  I think the coolest person I‚Äôve found so far was a fellow Blacksmith that was selling items at the IF AH same time as me.  We just stood there for about 20 mins spamming chat, then just started a convo and went from there.  Now we‚Äôre waving and chatting every time we pass each other.  If they weren‚Äôt 6 levels above me, we‚Äôd probably be grouping too.
---
Well they will also be 60 then and if they were higher lvl than u when u were ganked, chances are they play more and u won't be able to kill them. But yea I have also Spy add-on. It is fun recognize some of the gankers
---
Currently levelling a mage alt and thinking of farming lower dungeons for cloth/boe/gold at some point. At what levels would it be possible to start doing big pulls in dungeons like WC/SFK/BFD?
---
I got told to go back to retail by a 3-boxing guy that bugged out on me for tagging a mob he was *running towards.*
---
This was in a fairly populated STV, and I was *not* paying that much attention.
---
Some people are ridiculous.
---
Tailoring feeds enchanting, so unless you have an alt to feed your enchanting or you solicit other people for mats via trading for free enchants it'll be slow going or pricey. Tailoring also gives you access to certain tailoring-only gear that you can make/wear. Bags never go out of style. Mooncloth CD never goes out of style. 
---
Affliction does excellent DPS in 5 man dungeons. It's not great for raiding only because of the debuff limit. There are, of course, optimal openers etc, but each player has a different potential re: tracking dots and timing etc. In general, I open with Immolate into Corruption and then Agony. Shadow bolt spam, and keep your dots up without clipping (don't have new dot land before old dot finishes). There are exception to the rule. I'd rather clip a dot than say, have it be off for more than 2 seconds. Life tap before  you go oom. When the boss is below 20% health, I generally stop dots and just shadow bolt spam, since the damage per cast time of dots is lower than shadow bolt when the dots won't run their full duration.
---
But "spell cleave"
---
Love the editing in your videos dude, looking forward to the next!
---
I hope &lt;surprise&gt; will burn like the pile of shit they are.
---
There isn‚Äôt much more added, better off sticking to current setup and maybe even farming couple of your prot BiS before making the switch.
---
REEEEE how could you not know something NOOB
---
That allows them to feel morally Superior to you in the end. "Oh, they left anyway, they ninjad, they broke their promise." 
---
Take the lot. Pay them their shard. Then gquit. It'll be much harder to rationalize themselves as the victims in that scenario.
---
This is how I became the best geared feral on the server in vanilla. Shhh lol
---
Ummmm you only need enchanting level 1 to disenchant any item in the game. Don't feel obligated to power-level enchanting.
---
So if a healer dont heal a dps lets Say a rogue who then dies instantly on ragna fight because of not getting healed that means even if he win rolls the anything he cant get it because he got carried?
---
I have a useful /oom macro that I spam when were wrapping up a pull if we've had three pulls in a row and I need to drink. I hit it like 3 or 4 times and jump around the tank, but make sure to hit him with whatever I got heal-wise. A renew or a flash heal, whatever to show him I care. This usually commands enough respect for him to stop so I can get mana and we can keep running again.
---

Damn you seriously keep uploading these right after I get through with the corresponding quest/dungeon. Ran this shit for the first time last night

Completed the northern stv quests then brutally murdered every horde on my walk to desolace.

Halfway across a BG and at range for range DPS is a bit different üòÇ

A ring

If you're bringing pugs they should be allowed to roll on items. That's it.
---
Nooooo ü§£üòÇ
---
&gt;You've already been proven wrong countless times in this thread.
---
How? By somebody saying "it doesn't give Me advantage" over and over again, when it clearly does. When clearly people are paying more for a reason.
---
If layers disappear, there's also fewer players let online. This reduces buyers and farmers at an equal rate. Same way as layers add farmers and buyers at an equal rate.
---
thanks everyone, i guess it's a waste of time to farm for it now then. :)
---
Idk who would downvote you. Warlock just counters mage unless theres a huge skill/item/level discrepancy. Theyre the easiest matchup aside from priest.
---
Its shit like this that fucked retail up years ago
---
Most classes need some kind of BoE epic or blue for BiS which is not at all worth the current price and will drastically lower soon enough, but the prices for those are through the roof atm.
---
The fact is only more hardcore "gotta-raid-now" type players are reaching 60, some more casual but experienced as well. Those players are the only ones feeding supplies into the market, so there is a huge shortage of a lot of materials for BiS items.
---
All of that said, if Warden's Staff drops, that's basically equivalent to me looting *my* BiS by nature of looting Warden's Staff. I can sell it and then buy my own. In other words, Warden's Staff *is* BiS for all, because it sells for as much as your actual BiS.
---
It's worth a lot if you process it and vendor it. There's certain leatherworking patterns that are high value to a vendor with low material requirements.
---
1 medium hide + 4 medium leather = 12s Hillman's shoulders
---
1 heavy hide + 8 heavy leather = 26s barbaric shoulders
---
5 thick leather + 9s thread = 45s nightscape headband
---
This has been my main source of income from level 27 to 40. I skin and process my own leather, and each time I go back to a city I also buy all of the leather that gives a good margin on these recipes and do it all in batches.
---
Leatherworking is insanely profitable but it's not very intuitive that the way to make it profitable is to craft armor to be vendored.
---
Do you have the addon called rangedisplay? 
---
It puts up a little display box that goes like 0-5, 5-20, 20-30, 30-35, out of range. Even can play little sounds for when you get in/out of range of stuff. 
---
For my mage it plays a sound when I cross the 30 yard threshold and a warning sounds when any targeted mob gets within 5 years of me.
---
That being said, they are fun quests and good XP(as the other posts mentioned)
---
Well me and you baby and nothing but mammals
---
Last night I get into a Arena-Anger-Golem farm group.  Very first run, TRINKET, my heart was pounding out of my chest because I honestly didnt expect it to drop.  Only two people who need in the group, myself and a rogue so we got a good 'ol fashion roll off.  I roll a 90, he rolls an 82... OMG I GOT WON!!  I tell the rogue in chat "Dont worry man, we will reset and get you one".  He laughs, complains about his RNG and says he doesnt think it's going to happen....
---
Very next run, Trinket again! No roll off this time, Mr Rogue gets his trinket :)
---
My prayers to RNGesus must have been answered, I dont even have words for the incredible luck of getting back-to-back trinkets.
---
Look at your wand's DPS. Cast Drain Life once. Look at the number that ticks. If the wand's number is higher (it usually isn't), then it's higher DPS.
---
This. Precisely.
---
Relationships are temporary, internet dragons are eternal
---
I stopped reading when you called having an epic mount a weird flex.
---
Why do ppl even started using "spellcleave" term now with Classic, all of a sudden? It was always AOE all these yrars since 2004. I don't get it.
---
It's rough with succ because if he gets a poly off, he can kill your pet incredibly easily.
---
You would definitely die with a dps set equipped doing optimally sized pulls. Not sure how what class I play changes the tooltip for warrior abilities if I play one or not ü§î
---
Surprise, we steal your shit
---
&gt;Also Bonechewer has a 2.8 AS, Ravager, which you can get 6 levels earlier, has a top end 16 points higher. Your Mortal Strikes and Whirlwinds will hit about 10% harder with Ravager or Whirlwind Axe.
---
Where are you getting this 10% number from? Are you aware weapon damage is normalized regardless of AS? I took the liberty of calculating the max possible non crit damage of each weapon.
---
 The formula for weapon damage is: base weapon damage + (X x AP/14)
---
Where X is : 
---
1.7¬†for daggers
---
2.4¬†for other one-handed weapons
---
3.3¬†for two-handed weapons
---
2.8¬†for ranged weapons
---
So for simplicities sake I took the max possible base dmg for each weapon and plugged it into the formula using my level 57 warrior's Attack Power of 731.
---
Ravager: 157 + (3.3 x 731/14) = 329
---
Bonechewer: 141 + (3.3 x 731/14) = 313
---
Now remember the 157 and the 141 are the max damage each weapon can do before any modifiers, I chose to use max damage for simplicities sake. Since they are both two handed weapons their normalized AS is defaulted to 3.3 in calculating damage. As you can see, ravager only out does Bonechewer by 16 damage, and even this is likely incorrect as I did not account for the additional 46 AP you would get from equipping Bonechewer (+23 STR). 
---
If I'm wrong please correct me, I pulled all these numbers and equations from the wiki/in game, and I'd like to know if there's something I'm missing here.
---
Woke up and decided to hoof it to Badlands before work. Figured I'd just stop and check Broken Tooth's spawn, not even remotely thinking there was a possibility he'd be up.
---
Sure enough, no Broken Tooth. Killed a few coyotes and needed to log off and get ready for work. I see a Night Elf Hunter book it towards his north spawn. I activate Aspect of the Cheetah and RUN after him.
---
I see Broken Tooth and the NE Hunter sees me. I start attacking him and kill him. He's level 37, I just hit 40. I start trying to tame and I see a friendly priest wander over to see what all the action is - enter Dais.
---
The NE Hunter respawns, the graveyard is only a short run away. He interrupts me. I run from BT and FD. Dais starts healing me and helping me take down the NE again.
---
I start taming a second time. Now a 38 gnome mage wanders over. She seems peaceful and interrupts me right at the last second (side note, never trust a gnome). NE Hunter respawns. Dais and myself take down the mage, switch to the NE Hunter.
---
My heart is pounding...
---
Third attempt at taming.....and the NE doesn't respawn. He let's me have it (TY sir and I hope you eventually get him as well.) Proud owner of Broken Tooth. Now known as Goremaw.
---
I go to trade the priest all the gold I had on my character - a measly 3 gold - all I had after purchasing my mount the same morning. He turns it down and says, "don't worry about it!" I thank him profusely to which he just responds - "Pass it on."
---
I will Dais. I will pass it on. I can't thank you enough for your help today my friend. You made my day.
---
Moments like these are why I treasure this gem of a game.
---
Nice I'll check it out. Thanks!

---
If you spec deep prot you'll use a shield because Shield Slam becomes your best threat ability and your best damage source as well. If you are tanking as Arms or Fury then it's more situational. You can simply use a shield at all times and be fine. You can weapon swap in combat so you can use a 2H when it's appropriate - typically better suited for fighting caster groups but it's really just dependent on the healer situation.
---
In the earlier dungeons it's usually easy to charge in and activate sweeping strikes, swap to berserker stance and WW, then move back to defensive stance. Sometimes I would initiate pulls like this with a 2h if I felt it wasn't that threatening. On more threatening packs I would stick with a shield and charge + thunder clap then immediately go defensive and apply demo shout. Once the packs are thinned out you can swap back to the 2H if you want as well.
---
Are you suggesting that the few private servers prior to classic were more popular than any single 1 official server? Aren't there something like 60k people in the most popular ones?
---
No, you totally didn't just imagine I was some druid, and that I said stuff about holding aggro.  Or any of the other dumb shit you've said.
---
I see a dumbass on the internet who won't let it drop and has a hard on for me.
---
is this a way to hide your melee weapon so pvp enemies dont know what you have until ravager pops?
---
Me too--just the other night I was wandering around Stonetalon. I'm a backpacker, so traipsing around the mountain was super relaxing, even though I was alone for that.
---
If people tank the prices of mats that's their fault and it's just more money in my pocket at the end of the week but the BoE market is less driven by reselling, having that sweet purple drop and going to find out it's worth only 5g is a heartbreaker.
---
True, horde scum!
---
I would make a macro specifically for them to post every time they search for PUG raid members.
---
What do you think of having Robe of Winter instead like the guy above says? I'm pretty casual so I don't want to spend a week farming for a 2% edge
---
I have a lot of fun playing the game.
---
Versus having to deal with fuck wit #874 who has decided that I should not play the game for the next hour.
---
I cut my teeth playing on a PvP server when classic was the only WoW.
---
I cannot describe how much more fun I have like this.
---
guys guys guys.... the best way to go about this. is to make \[Halo of Transcendence\] a meme.
---
I'm 53 and only have 1 BiS so far, so I'd say you are fine. Most people seem to still be between level 30-50 from what I noticed. You are definitely not behind, at least not in comparison to most players.
---
But you need him to write that on game chat
---
Just do whatever is most comfortable.  A lot of people do what Syndic does.  W - forward, S  - back, A - strafe left, D - strafe right and most commonly used buttons 1-4, Q, E, R, T, F, G, Z, X, C, V and other binds as ALT+ and SHIFT+ the commonly used buttons.
---
I'm a bit more unconventional in I use ESDF for movement as normal hand placement on home keys feels natural and you have more buttons available because the pinky finger has access to more buttons.  Took awhile to rewire brain from muscle memory of WASD because I used initially also, but I was reading about hotkeys and someone mentioned they did ESDF.
---
If mages used arcane explosion we could bring back the DAoC/EQ term PBAoE
---
Also I don‚Äôt think you can comprehend very well because I only said you could go prot if you wanted, not that it is better. I was only talking shit on the WW axe comment üôÇ
---
Yeah I‚Äôll admit for me it‚Äôs very clear the difference between some players who have only played retail and are used to the ‚Äúgo go go‚Äù attitude.
---
Doing a zf run yesterday on heartseeker with a paladin tanking, we all zone in and start buffing up with the mage passing out water. He pulls the first group and we manage to scramble while trading water to kill the mobs.
---
He then goes and pulls another group with heals at 10% mana and the mage oom. The paladin then uses all his cds to survive since we don‚Äôt have the dmg/cc with the mage oom. 
---
He complains to the group ‚Äúwtf I nearly died‚Äù I respond ‚Äúwe need mana, you have to wait for us to drink‚Äù he then pulls another group while the healer is drinking 20% mana, which we barely survive again‚Äù
---
He then responds ‚Äúwtf are you guys doing I had to use my cd‚Äôs‚Äù to which I say ‚Äúman calm down, you have to wait for us to drink, and if not I‚Äôll find another tank‚Äù 
---
He then proceeds to start swearing at us, I kick him and find a warrior in a min summon him and clear Zf with 0 wipes
---
TLDR: tanks please wait for mana, and don‚Äôt be a dick
---
I usually sit and watch ally near horde and only swoop in if the hordie gets attacked
---
From what I understand, faction rep in Classic can only really be gained with cloth turn ins and quests so you better start farming up some cloth.
---
I think thats the exact build im using.
---
Right now im seriously considering dropping improved PW:S, the one point in threat reduction, and maybe one of the points in the stun/interrupt resist in the Disc tree to get the improved wand damage back.
---
For raiding and once i get alts to 50+ and can farm on them i'd go back to this probably, but trying to even farm felcloth right now sucks.  
---
I cant use PW:S too awful much in groups anyways because of rage starving tanks (on dps sometimes its useful, but often times the tank manages to be able to pull threat back, or the dps is good and can kite/mitigate/drop threat, etc so its a waste), and im really thinking its not worth the 3 talent points.
---
Threat honestly hasnt been much of an issue, though ive had good tanks.  Things seem to be nice in that regard at 60.
---
Stun/interrupt resist is nice...and maybe i'd opt to keep one point there and go 4/5 on wand, but im not 100% sure that last 3% is necessary for 5 mans.
---
Multidotting is slower, generally.
---
See there we go again.
---
I never said I was great, i said try my best which is to you not enough
---
U seem to confiat what I said with what u heard 
---
Classic tanking isnt  simple .. And requires teamwork but if u only have descending voice and over righteous attitude. Which can only be described as being a dick on the issue.
---
All of your stated solutions are basic  but to no impact on the stated problem
---
Your views are in short simplistic. Which reflects either an incapability  or refusal to approach the issue from any other view than yours. .
---
Therefore I said to you good luck in life for you well need it
---
Language does this awesome thing called implying, where stating the old (relatively-speaking) age of the gear implies its lesser significance/importance.
---
To parrot your opening: imagine not understanding that implication.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection
---
Really shit culture.
---
Last time I checked, both factions have past through multiple great wars so this war isn't fresh. With perhaps more than 20 years fighting, you're going to tell me within that time span, neither sides have settled? This isn't even about a settlement between both factions like retail, perhaps you should think before you post.
---
Nice, however I don‚Äôt see a blizzard anywhere.
---
What a load of crap. If you want to take the moral high ground: Dont undercut at all.
---
Voidwalker will hold threat if you let him get a few hits in first. I like to start with Immolate (as a habit) because if I'm pulling the mob, I can have 2 dots up before it starts heading towards me, instead of it coming my way already while I'm starting to cast my second spell. I also like the refresh sequence when you cast Immolate first. On a boss I'd cast Immolate into Agony.
---
What did your talent tree look like if you don't mind me asking?
---
They have this mode called PVE it's were all the complainers and bitchers should play
---
Gz on 60! So far I've gone from 310 to 260 gold after a few weeks of 60 so I will refrain from giving advice.
---
Get to 60 and farm the shit out of SM cath usually works for me. There are more efficient ways but they involve luck and there being no competition from other players, things you can‚Äôt really rely on.
---
Yup, this.  
---
I charge, bloodrage, shout, and the mage has already cast cone of cold on the mobs before GCD is up for my first sunder.  
---
Me: Can you not aoe? Or wait a few seconds.  
---
Him: Why don't you just sunder all of the mobs. It's not that hard.
---
hahaha. People kept talking about him and his "deeds" for such a long time that it got fixed on my mind. Also, there was a joke that his name would mean "He'll take". :D
---
At level 10, there's not much you can do against 5. Against three, you have to really make sure your VW gets two of them off you (Ctrl+1 is the default pet attack keybind, use it manually)  while you Fear the third. Put your DoTs on everything. You're going to intentionally pull aggro off the one attacking your VW that it isn't actively attacking, and finish that one (use your wand to save mana). Then, you re-Fear the one you already feared while you kill the one your VW has been keeping busy. Your DoTs by this point will probably be pulling aggro already. Then, you finish the fear one.
---
Probably a bug
---
i feel this way at times as a warrior while leveling
---
That's what Master Loot is, and how this happened.
---
Two days ago I found Tin Ore on the AH there for 85s a piece. Thing is there were only two listings in total. This is from hoarders and people trying to control the market. Tin Ore vendors for something like 1.5s. AH prices of other raw materials in that level range (wool cloth, copper ore, whatever applicable herbs) have recently been just a few copper above their vendor price.
---
Easily a 30% DPS increase, fast or not. If you think staying in ZF to farm Sulthraze is in any way faster than rushing to BRD you sir are the garbage.
---
Based on the "grow up" comment in reply to what was a pretty non aggressive comment here, you may in fact be a "dick"
---
doing quests at 60 gets you gold, too.
---
Are you popping it as a tank right before aoe pulling? Cause that was my experience when grouping with a healer friend, he wanted to yell at the tank.
---
I mean that sucks sure, but any BoE that's on the AH for 5g isn't priced like that because it's market has tanked it's because it's probably just fuckin shit. It's why I'm keeping all my low level twink items in the bank for now.
---
Yes! That's probly where all the confusion comes! Thanks mate!!
---
Makes sense, thanks for your detailed responses.
---
Yes. She sounds more ghastly.
---
I should say I've played vanilla on private servers for a fair few years probably since cata and so the amount of time I've spent running MC/Ony/Zg/AQ and what not is quite a lot so i've met my fair share of ninja looters/guilds but I still choose to join pugs because you cant assume every guildrun is gonna screw you over like this person.
---
Druid BIS gear is almost entirely outside of raids. Warden staff, trinkets, armor, neck, helmet etc. There are like max 3 upgrades in MC for them, whereas warriors have tons of shit they need to get from raids
---
Okay, so then I can avoid it if I don't intend to ever use a 2h white hit.
---
The premise isn't that 2H don't generate rage, it's that DW in optimal settings do more damage, but from what I understand their rage isn't used as effectively, so jumping between loadouts to burn through it seems like it might be doable.
---
Yeah idk why this is downvoted I straight up bought one for 35g.
---
You mean this one?

I don‚Äôt know if your serious or trolling right now. Killing a pet first is actually a legit strat sometimes depending on what class you are and what spec the hunter is.
---
I don't remember people reserving items until WotLK (i.e. reserving DBW in ICC). Reserving is really dumb and kinda defeats the purpose of a MMO.

Then that makes you ((((part of the problem))))

Whirlwind is a warrior ability not a weapon.
---
A DKP auction would work well here?
---
Sounds like you picked the right server.
---
I've also been playing since vanilla, but on an RP PVP server. Probably the community is different from a normal PvP server, but I appreciate not having important parts of the game literally unavailable to me.
---
If everyone stockpiles materials now, then it will take even longer for those prices to stabilize. Telling everyone to stockpile just hurts everyone that is stockpiling.
---
Yeah 20 can feel short for a caster/range DPS but for the most part you'll be targeting that player/npc anyways so you can see their healthbar anyways.

When you respec do you have to pay for the upgrade levels of talented moves again?

Guy has been in Sun Rock Retreat for 3 days now using the "rooftop exploit" to kill people without getting attacked by guards. Hopefully a screencap as proof is more than enough to actually force hands on it.

Yea, my level 5 bank alt shards all my mains BOEs.
---
It's ok man - let them rush and get bored so they all go somewhere else or back to retail.
---
Heavy Silk Bandages, mmmmm making monies
---
I am not sure being in berserker stance + taking 30% more damage is any better to be honest.
---
That's the way it is in all mythic progressing guilds in retail. You don't really fail bosses because of not enough heal or your tanks can't keep aggro, but because you don't meet certain dps requirements.
---
&gt; 9. What is your reaction when you see mobs attacking a DPS or the Healer? 
---
* I do everything to stop the mobs from attacking the healer.
---
* If dps get aggro form any secondary target then I usualy dont give a shit.

Yikes

Hi everyone. I see a lot of negativity towards mages on this sub. I personally only had great encounters with mages. I level an enhancement shaman and need water all the time...
---
I just wanted to say thanks to all the mages that are not fed up with people asking them for food and water. Not once I had someone who said no or nothing, or asked for something back. And trust me...I asked for so much fucking water!!
---
And an extra thank you to the mages that give you that nice arcane intellect on top of the water :).
---
You sound really mad still
---
Love playing WoW when it is cold and snowy outside so I don't feel bad that I don't leave the house. Plus I can bundle up for max comfy.

An experienced healer will let him die instead of blowing their mana on an idiot.
---
Not for that sm spell cleave! Eye of Kilrog mvp
---
no one with a brain will ever group with this guild again if thats their "defense" lol
---
Ohhhhhhhhmyyyyyyygoooooooood I could‚Äôve had my mount lmao
---
LOL, I guess people should know this so they won't help these assclowns
---
/roll 100-100 
---
Works every time
---
Wasn't it because it allowed the war to build extra threat on pull to avoid losing aggro to the yolodps crew?
---
Had someone steal mine when I first started leveling. 
---
I was so upset, but about a minute later a shaman popped up and invited me. It was a roller coaster of emotions.
---
Nefarian druid calls lmao
---
Woahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahwoahx100, what's that dungeon minimap add on called and can I get it on twitch?
---
Yikes, imagine being in a guild full of people like that
---
Fight in bear form, then pop out to heal when you get low.
---
Same thing applies when you get cat form 
---
You Regen Mana in bear/cat form
---
It‚Äôs always the gnomes lmao
---
Or did when the average population was around 3k for a realm. Now it's 5 times more + raids are a lot easier now and people don't exactly need the same amount of help they needed back in the day.
---
level 39 warlock here, have every skill, 4 bank bags all 14 slots, 295 tailoring, 300 fishing, 260 engineering and I logged off with 93g after sending a friend 13g to finish paying for their mount. Engineering is the only profession that sucked a lot of gold out of me, roughly 80g spent to power level to 260 in one night. I've done everything people say not to do while leveling to afford your mount, including multiple respeccs. Granted I get my mount for free from a quest so I haven't been concerned with saving the money. Fishing in Tanaris during my down time has kept me well stocked on gold.
---
You won‚Äôt win a ticket on loot that is ninja‚Äôd. You can report them. You can complain to Blizzard. But no actual rule was broken. No glitch/bug happened. An unwritten rule amongst the players was broken. It‚Äôs fucking bullshit, slimey, and ridiculous. But not ‚Äúticket worthy‚Äù.
---
That's obviously not the case here, so it doesn't apply.
---
Also, if a player dies instantly, the healers can't help them. Don't stand in fire. The healer's job may be to keep people alive, but it's also each individual player's job to avoid taking damage as much as possible. There are always going to be some instances where that's not possible, but if you stand in the fire and die because you didn't want to interrupt a cast, that's on you.
---
Nope, and one of the reasons I've given up on the loot grind.
---
People are scum.
---
That would actually be pretty badass. Let all druids get a 3rd language, Druidic, that they can speak across faction. They already share Moonglade so why not a language to complete the synergy.
---
Or let casual players enjoy things, like having fun with a pick up group clearing a dungeon. You can share tips without being dismissive of his enjoyment.
---
Ive been playing on different vanilla private servers the kast 4 years or so and have leveled to 60 a bunch of different times always with a group and my guildies but this time I'm solo and I gotta say, I kinda like it. Its a nice break for me to go at my pace and not worry about falling behind. Obviously i group with randoms now and then for quests but for the most part I'm on my own.
---
I 100% agree. It is terrible. I am a lvl 52 Druid tank and this whole spellcleave meta that has came about is the absolute worst.
---
It is armegedon. No one has noticed the zombie horde outside and the mods have all been over in for days. We are on our own. Good luck to you all.
---
I haven‚Äôt had sex since wow vanilla came out...
---
Well then someones ass up there to camp him
---
healer was needing runes that give mana in exchange for health. mage started needing them too stating he needs the runes as much as the healer does. starts whining when I need essences of undead for my robe of the void.
---
accountant_classic might be able to do that.
---
When did I say anything about sulthraze? Executioner's cleaver is going to hit significantly harder as it has +30 dmg over the angerforge axe. It has what? A 2.6 AS? That's not an arms weapon, period. This is not even accounting for the +chance to hit on cleaver. Really the only direct upgrade in that level range pre AV is the Dreadforge Retaliator.
---
Can someone explain what happened? I‚Äôm am super new to wow and I don‚Äôt understand how group looting works but I don‚Äôt want this to happen to me and I don‚Äôt want to accidentally do it either
---
Gender/class/race
---
You'll be lucky to find one boe epic outside of raids. I had over 3 months /played in vanilla and only ever got the Glowing Brightwood Staff that I had to sell to vendor because it dropped for me 2 months before TBC came out and it was completely worthless by then. Couldn't sell it at any price on AH.
---
I think within reason. If you‚Äôre bottom of list but not too far, then sure. If you enter and you‚Äôre bottom on list and the next worst person did 29.5x more Dmg or healing than you then yeah you probably played like shit
---
Because you can change which seal you use. SoC for 3.5 or more, SoR for anything faster than that
---
Most of the realm forums seem surprisingly dead. I guess that's what happens when you let trolls run rampant for 14 years.
---
Yeah it usually misses a lot on mobs about 3 levels+higher then me I noticed it a lot but it‚Äôs not too bad on others. I‚Äôve gotten pretty use to it, and really like the speed of dual wield. I rolled troll for the berserking ability so it really goes in hand I use a sword and dagger like a rogue so it‚Äôs pretty lit. I know I can probably do better with a 2h but would like to keep dual wield.
---
I‚Äôve never done it but herbalism is king from what I hear. Early game and late game.
---
 On my server devilsaur leather is actually farmable and not contested that bad so it def pays off if that‚Äôs how you want to make money. 
---
Rugged sells good and chimera barley ever drops for me and dose not sell for much more then rugged, so if your not doing devilsaur‚Äôs it‚Äôs probably better to switch it out with herbalism or engineering, since apparently that‚Äôs the best profession in the game for PvP and PVE
---
That or let them know right off the bat that you aren't going to prioritize them. Be open about it and if they want to come just to see content, so be it.
---
As another feral druid, I would probably cry in dire bear form.
---
Are you raiding and in a guild with main or designated people for profession? I'll assume you are since the advice is decent either way. I would take Tailoring and Herbalism. Get Tailoring to 300, make Robes of the Void, and drop it for another gathering profession.  
---
Herbalism - Will save you tons of money on consumables if you can get your own reagents. Plus, you can sell the excess for a decent amount since raiding is THE end game. 
---
I personally took mining since the farming I usually do puts me around valuable nodes. It's just some extra pocket money.  
---
In Phase 4, pick Tailoring back up to get the Bloodvine set. It's so far away, there is no reason to keep it 300 from now until then. The money you will make off a second gathering profession will more than make up for releveling it later.
---
Action is what bar? 
---
Would be cool
---
&gt;This game is starting to become boring for me, because every interaction I have with people now (above level 35) is always one-word messages, "hey", "ty", "thx", or no words whatsoever, and the occasional toxicity.
---
Probably because they are trying to level.
---
Talk to people more, some will be receptive, some won't. 
---
&gt;Anyway, just thought I'd give my 2 cents because I haven't played WoW now in 2 days because I just don't have anything to look forward to in the game. Level 40 and mount feels like it's atleast a week away even if I played everyday because of the cruelty of Azeroth and PvP servers.
---
Gotta find a guild and interact with them.
---
Pvp servers aren't fun for me, if you enjoy it then great! 
---
Game isn't supposed to be finished in a weekend
---
And anyone that tries to play solo will leave the game.
---
Interact, or don't and just solo farm.
---
If classic isn't interesting to you or you dont want to interact at all, the same sub gets you access to BFA - you can play that solo 100%
---
Man that's an amazing idea. How about we also add a chance that items can randomly be better versions of themselves? So that you don't need a guild but only a bit of luck to get super amazing items?
---
Thanks so much! Always eager to bring in more people with an eye for these things. Hope you have more to share.
---
Spellcleaving instances wasn‚Äôt a mainstream thing. But it did exist. I know. I did it myself.
---
Helped my buddy get Cruel Barb on his lowbie rogue alt.
---
I agree with rule three for everything whether it is true or not. But I want to make it clear that even his own guild members didn't like him ninjaing it and someone screenshotted those conversations.
---
I believe it was added during the BC launch. IIRC, you could DE anything with a skill of 1 all the way up to and including patch 2.0. I can personally confirm that I was able to DE mid 40's greens with an enchanting level below 100 in Classic.
---
My bank alt is just stashing mats. One day itll pay off
---
Is his guild, Bad Juice, condoning this I wonder.
---
Was not me. I just moved on and didnt really do anything about it. I think that if an item drops that's an improvement for someone it doesn't matter if its boe, they should get it.
---
I've passed on two Krol blades and a freezing band because someone actually needed them and would use them. I've rolled need and won a helmet of narv because no one in the group needed it.
---
If you're leveling as a trio, you have to kill 3 times as many things as solo. Pull 3 mobs at a time, even if you don't need the specific mob. Druid keeps aggro on them, you dot the hell out of all 3, and the healer keeps druid alive. You should be doing the most damage by a large margin. Pulling fewer than 3 and you're going to be bored regardless of spec.
---
Non WoW payer here. Why is this possible? It seems like the benefits are few and the negatives are many. It just seems like a "feature" that only exists to grief players to me.
---
Tons of fury warriors are willing to tank dungeons because finding a group as dps takes forever.
---
Press tab
---
To do: Make a female druid and turn her into a mass murdering killing machine.
---
Shaman never got their class patch did they?
---
I ran ZF countless times levelling through the 40s and never even saw half of Sul'Thraze  drop.
---
Grays man!
---
Needs a red defias mask and a harvest watcher in the background
---
Right. While ninja looting is obviously lame, you've clearly only posted half of the story. What the hell even happened? Am I supposed to make a snap judgement on this guy with not all of the facts?
---
That'll be 20 silver per stack.
---
I had 3/3 Improved Renew and other priests were overwriting my Renew. Does it take into account +healing to determine who overwrites the others?
---
Lmao I‚Äôm crying right now. So glad I posted this to get corrected- going to bust ass to get my mount now lol. Thank you
---
The Robe of Void is better for raw damage, strictly speaking, and provides the damage bonus to all your spells instead of just shadow. That all being said though, the difference isn‚Äôt too much, and the Robe of Winter Night actually has int on it. Better yet, you can just buy the latter since the former is a Bind-on-pickup craftable.
---
If i'm not mistaking the loot being change applies to the 5man dungeon groups not toward raid loot. Raid loot they are not specific with yet as they are aware they can be abused but it's p straight forward with loot rules.
---
isnt it much more convenient to press print screen than getting your phone ou to take a picture?
---
i agree, but many people won't - i would equip the boe in front of them too and would expect others to
---
yeah they're weird, 1c undercut is exactly what you want in the market you're selling in.
---
Should of responded "good luck finding my layer!"
---
Arcane crystals are between 25-30g on my server?  Is that dirt cheap?  I'm honestly asking because the vanilla wow economy is new to me.
---
Awesome, thanks for the tips. Much appreciated
---
Oh i don't disagree, I just think people are making a mountain out of a molehill sometimes when it comes to undercutting, especially when the server is new and people value less gold now than more gold later.
---
In the TBC days rogues would try to shadowstep the warrior intercept. You had to wait for him to start the intercept and not anticipate it, you got lucky :)
---
Everytime i see anyone writing in a trade chat or general chat about someone ninja looting, the one informing gets a lot of shit. I wish ppl would drop this attitude, they  are only helping ninja looters
---
Warlocks and Paladins get free mounts at 40! :)
---
It's because the question is easily answerable via a quick google search and most people down voting probably assume it's common knowledge anyways.
---
Top ten most deadliest places
---
Eh, more realistically (unless you get carried) at 38 or 39 since you have to run Cath.
---
These guys are even worse than you think. Look at their members' responses on the Arugal subreddit. This guild is scum:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Arugal/comments/d9zfga/surprise_on_arugal_are_ninja_looters_my_healing/f1mih3s?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Back in vanilla my best friend who was our main tank took plate healing gear no one needed from our raids just so he could sit in IF on the bridge and piss people off because he was better geared in his "healing set" than healers from every other guild but one across the server.
---
Well it was turned into a farming account. By the time my brother got the account back it's mining and herbalism were damn near maxed for the level and its bags were full of ore/plants.
---
Lots of people will agree, that the mage has as much need on healer items as the warrior and would call him a ninja looter for rolling on a healer item. There is also the meme of the hunter rolling on stuff for his "pet heal equipment". You can literally roll need on stuff, that you can not even use in classic. One might even roll need just to piss someone off.
---
Clear and enforced loot rules are used to prevent drama. And as I said, they usually work. Especially since blizzard will enforce them, if they were stated in chat.
---
I did it in a really quick and dirty way, and normalized by "number of mobs needed to kill of equal level to player"
---
10-20 is 1.57 times 0-10, 
---
20-30 is 1.52 times 10-20, 
---
30-40 is 1.62 times 20-30
---
40-50 is  1.41 times 30-40 and 
---
50-60 is 1.13 times 40-50.
---
People only like this weapon because its unique to obtain and purple.
---
The dps, speed, onhit being bad AND lack of stats make it garbage and not used by anybody. 
---
Its stylish, but shit. The weapons from Uld and any 55+ instance are better.
---
Not on a PvP server, no.  An extra subscription/account would be required.  These big streamers have nothing but money to do that with.
---
I like Leatrix Plus the best because I can simply click and drag the tooltip wherever I want to.
---
Paladin had absolutely no right to roll need. Mage would, if he wasn't getting carried by us as a courtesy. We would've probably allowed him to roll had he asked. 
---
Need is for when you can actually use it on that character(aka can equip and it's an upgrade), no matter if it's bop or boe. Needing to "give it to your main" or "to make some money" is considered stealing(ninja) by most.
---
Peacemaker is strictly better than dals. The 15agi enchant is needed to make dals better and it isn't in the game.
---
I know he'd never run around and hurt them
---
Well said, this comment is great
---
I'm going through the trees as I level focusing on crit and combo point generation. I plan on going all the way to Premed for those 2 extra CP before hitting Ambush. I'm skipping Hemmorage (in favor of Ghostly Strike for dodge=CP). and only taking Lightning Reflexes in the combat tree (for CP generation from Setup). 
---
I'll use the extra talent points for Deadliness.

Can u explain what pug means ?

Who's the 2nd person on ignore?

They still did this in warlords so I imagine they will
---
Im a reddit nerd and I have a girlfriend....what's wrong with me OP.. plz help..
---
yea sometimes im like "ok ill turn in this quest, buy new spells, and walk to the next zone i need to be"
---
still fun
---
People even talked about Demonology specced tanks.  I think it would be really cool to have Demo swapping back and forth between tanking and his pet tanking.
---
Make smart decisions and experiment. I'm not sure how powerful destro is in classic, but it's the glass cannon spec for warlock.
---
Check you out with your fancy word-talking
---
It definitely happened in Vanilla with semi-pugs, usually a smaller group of 2-3 people forming a run they only need 1-2 items from, especially if they have either a Healer or Tank. Prob more prevalent now in Classic since you can be out qusting/farming and trying to form groups in LFG instead of spamming in Trade/General chat only in Town.
---
I do like how there's some who spend I swear 3+ hours trying to find a tank to his 'reserved Ravager run' lmao.
---
The funny thing is if this is really a guy from their guild, then a better defense would be to ignore it and say nothing. At least then it would be a he-said she-said scenario.
---
Hard earned epics! Not like retail!
---
I'm 41 with 55g. But also levelled all profs to 255. Holding off on levelling to 300 until I have the mount
---
Need that shadow weaving
---
I was at lvl 40 with 5 gold. Spent the day grinding out the deviate fish recipe and a bunch of fish and got all the gold i needed for my mount. Sold the fish for 75s/5stack
---
What a stupid fucking thing to say.
---
What are you sitting at now? Money from drops and quests picks up substantially after 40. As long you're relatively frugal, it shouldn't be hard to start getting 10+g/level in the 40's.
---
I'm aware. I edited for clarification
---
They don't ban you for simply being in a chat channel. They look for things like equipment and/or gold transfers, and even then they'll only ban if you were trading with the known gold seller or whatever.
---
Counterpoint: Tanking is easy.
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä JAGEX IS POWERLESS AGAINST AN EXPONENTIAL XP CURVE ü¶Äü¶Ä

I think many people would argue that wPVP is a huge part of the game.
---
For me and my friends/guild it's like 75% of what we look forward to doing once we're all 60 and geared.
---
Just a thought.
---
Here I am settting up look priority for my team and put myself last wise mehhh
---
Agreed on all counts.
---
Nah. Garruk came out in 2008 bud. Garruk is the MTG version of Rexxar
---
People post and complaing about ninjas from time to time. This thread managed to take of, now this sub pretend to be outraged for a day and tomorrow it's back to normal.
---
Warlock has the advantage of sustain (draining life with spell and converting health into mana to keep on truckin) and pets to take the beating for you for further sustain. Drain tanking is a think if you're into it, but not necessary. Rogue definitely hits like a truck at lower levels, but eventually you have to slow down and be more surgical in pulling mobs and trying to get to quest objectives etc. Rogue can level just fine, but it has far fewer tools to handle multiple mobs, elites, and you can't send you pet into hold aggro while you loot a quest item that nearly every other class has to clear mobs to get to.
---
Just need to farm like 20 a week ;-)
---
Whenever I think about cat form dps it just makes me sad how much work you have to do to be so mediocre :-(
---
There are plenty of people without the slightest bit of dignity whom are hard to understand by normal people. 
---
You usually only know who they are once you've had the displeasure of dealing with them.
---
Better just not give a single of your precious fucks for dudes like that.
---
Classes weren‚Äôt nearly this powerful when classic first came out. If you think people are 22 manning onyxia because of new generation gamer skill- you‚Äôre feeling unearned pride.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a look!
---
Was he still in the guild when he found out? Did anything happen?
---
It's literally a novelty weapon, so makes me feel pretty neutral
---
Server economy will of course make a difference but how much should I typically charge for a transmute arcanite cooldown?
---
Thats the easy part.
---
layering is so annoying... people flee from battles by asking for invites in guild...
---
I personally don't think so.
---
&gt;auto-undercuts
---
Why the fuck is this shit even allowed??
---
So basically ban literally everything that is from the game and become another /r/wow with 98% of art, cooking and tattoos.
---
Kang is an extremely poor choice financially as it's only marginally better than the cleaver. Also dungeon grinding to 60 is incredibly tedious.
---
Cleave and AoE are two different things....If you are hitting one mob and your attack bounces/reaches another, that's cleaving. AoE (area of effect) is spells like blizzard, cone of cold, hellfire etc.
---
I started early TBC and this is how it has always been from my experience. Maybe standards were different per server? I was a tank in TBC doing heroics and the last dark moon card I needed for the tank trinket dropped. I mentioned it was the last one I needed and offered to buy it from the winner. Everyone kindly rolled greed, but by no means did I expect them to.
---
What is a pug?
---
Never said locked, I said exclusive, and by exclusive, I meant not conveniently accessible by the opposing faction. Dungeons like like Ragefire Chasm and Stockade. This doesn't exclude the possibility of future dungeons, if the game does acquire it's own identity, being added to the game.
---
As far as the faction war goes, yes, but that's like saying everyone before the civil rights movement was racist. Your opinion of the faction may be to obliterate them, mine is not care for the war. With how it works in the game, you never had a choice.
---
they have roar that decreases enemy attack power, fairy fire, heals over time, change form for CC cancel, tanking, single dps... the only bad thing of druid is that you can do just something at once, like most other classes. Druids biggest power is their adoptability
---
Tbh there is little to no gear competition between fury and prot warriors - even good tanking 1hs look pretty meh to fury, with a handful of exceptions.
---
I don't believe the GM (or whoever posted in that thread) at all, he is using multiple excuses for why he gave it to the other healer.  He conveniently doesnt post any screenshots of loot rules (Likely because there werent any), but posts death logs to indicate that the healer died early and try to shift blame.  He also claims that the healer was "standing infront of Onyxia" which is just another lie to try to bolster his argument.
---
The original OP should open a ticket, Blizzard has always taken action against ninjas.  They can go back in chat logs and prove/disprove whatever "loot rules" were outlined at the start and adjust loot accordingly.
---
Yea that just doesn't hold true at the highest levels of progression.  We don't really have any bosses in Classic that require true min-maxing, but you opinion was proved false time and again in retail.
---
Nothing felt more spot on than that forum post. Seems to be most the people in WoW subreddits
---
Taurens are also the reason the untrustworthy Forsaken were allowed into the Horde, that backfired.
---
Pick up group
---
Yes, the higher roll should have. The loot system is "master looter", where the raid leader chooses who loot goes to. Typically, players who need it will roll for it, and whoever gets the highest role is chosen by the master looter. The master looter in the picture was corrupt and gave it to his guildmate instead of the one who won the roll
---
Is there a stickied post with confirmed ninjas per realm (with screenshot proof)
---
A lot of players are coming from a time where server community was non existent so it's up to us to self police the issue
---
No you right. A warrior ninjad staff or dagger from lib and i wrote to a gm. He said next time write loot rules in chat before but he punished the guy anyway since they can see the chat history. The guy also wrote in chat he needed for gold to mount so that might have helped.
---
So next time in raid be sure that leader writes loot rules. I dont get why people dont ask for it since almost every pug raid i was in people asked for it. In my opinion its mandatory.
---
I would bet he was refering to spell cleave dungeons. Anyway you can do it solo if you got right spot for it. I have aoe farmed my way from 22 to 34 then did SM runs. Around 42 i did few quests and got in to ZF as a blizzard mage to control the mobs (hard to get in). At 46 i went for maraudon aoe farming, It's 3rd part (stone snakes?) at 52 i switched to BRD arena with aoe group. There is list on the internet where the good spot are, if it's occupied just switch layer.
---
Are the elemental earth farmers why the elementals in Badlands are so camped?
---
I was out there last night just trying to do a quest and I wanted to kill myself.
---
Add-ons generally show data missing or make QOL fixes
---
Easy examples are showing vendor prices, selling junk items (no use aside from vendoring) in masse, colouring bag items by type, etc.
---
Here's an excellent list someone put together here the other day:
---

---
Lol, this is a terrible reply.
---
Not in classic
---
You're forgetting that you have to kill a raid boss once you get everything together.  That will be a hard boss to get a pug for.
---
&gt;that's not what a meme spec is.
---
Feral druid is exactly what a memespec is, it cannot perform the same roll as the 'proper' class for the role and has no benefits to offset it. It's not quite as bad as ret paladin or balance druid but it's far from normal.
---
If feral druids were changed to be able to equip axes, have a good threat ability to use alongside autoattacks, use potions and sappers in form, have a shield wall like ability then they would be fine.
---
I played a druid and a warrior from day 1.
---
For a LONG time, Druids were terrible. HoT-based, but only 1 HoT of each type at a time. Bad talents, bad forms.
---
Once everyone got their talents fixed, Druids were viable. I was MTing up to AQ with no issues. I also healed many times with the 0/30/21 spec, it was the best.
---
Warriors were only better in that they have MUCH better "oh shit" buttons, but if you're playing well, you never need them.
---
Which is garbage. Masterloot is fine. Loot rules are binding. If the masterlooter doesn't post the rules, you are at your own fault.
---
From my experience, everyone should need when you're in a pug of any kind. If a guild mate wants you to get it, then they can pass it along if they win. As you said, everyone could use the gold and there's no way the randoms are going to know that a class who could use it isn't going to just sell it themself. 
---
The most common scenario I've seen is what happened to you. Someone wins, sells it to a class that wants to equip it for a, usually, discounted price.
---
BUTTLICKER, OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER!
---
I remember people thinking that was good just because it was purple.
---
Ah, very nice.  That's making a lot more sense.
---
BoE blue or purple, everyone need.  If you actually needed the item, you would buy it.  If you haven‚Äôt already bought it, you‚Äôve made the conscious decision that the gold is worth more than the item.   At that point, it would be unfair of you to expect the group to give it to you, allowing you to have your cake (item) and eat it too (gold).
---
An item isn't "valued" at anything other than what people are paying for it. Just because people are selling an item for 40g doesn't make it inherently worth 40g.
---
Public group
---
You can shift click a name, and it will tell you level, class, race, and zone.
---
Dark is so fucking good
---
Dude, murlocs are top of the food chain, those bastards take no prisoners.

Garruk is the MTG version of Rexxar and Rexxar is the WoW version of Garruk.

Meh people like instant money in WoW, I doubt this post will affect anything on the grand scale, markets should be healthy by then anyways.

You're either a troll or you don't have much going on in your life if you're taking time out of your day to disagree with someone on how they took a screenshot...Bye now.
---
You're right I didn't think about accounting for AP contribution at all which is a huge oversight on my part. 
---
And after accounting for the strength bonus (46 AP is 3.3 DPS which is basically 11 damage on a 3.3 coefficient). Your Ravager is only hitting for 5 more than Bonechewer which is like 2.5%. You definitely would rather be using Bonechewer over Ravager (excluding consideration of the proc when appropriate)
---
AS normalization is a thing, but slow weapons do still hit a lot harder. Comparing Bonechewer to Executioner's Cleaver or either of the Ulda weapons would have better illustrated my point.
---
Thanks for pointing out the fact that I was totally ignoring AP contribution, that's half your damage at most levels.
---
In older expansions, and classic, the raid leader generally had control of the loot. When an item dropped, and it was a PUG run (pick up group of random players), players would roll for the item (/roll 100). The highest roller would win the item. Generally speaking, once you won an item, you went to the back of the line. Anyone who had not won an item had priority over previous loot winners of a specific raid run. It was based around fairness and chance. Lot rules were dependent upon the specific raid group, but the vast majority of PUG raids I ran used this method. 
---
Guilds often had their own method called DKP (Dungeon/Dragon Kill Points) which was based on a mix of total contribution. If you had the most DKP and wanted the item, it was yours, but you would lose the DKP offered up. This generally allowed guilds to cycle loot drops through the guild, with the highest contributors receiving loot more often (usually because they build up more DKP through raids and dungeons).
---
A loot ninja is someone who chooses to keep the loot themselves, or break the generally agreed upon lot rules to pass the loot to someone who should not have won. This could be a guild mate who chooses to give a highly sought after weapon to another guildie even though they lost the roll, bans specific players from rolling on items without telling them before the run, etc. Essentially, someone who is incredibly greedy, who chooses to break socially created rules that are intended to keep things fair.
---
If playing classic, I would recommend avoiding guild runs, if you aren‚Äôt in the guild, unless you know the guild and raid leaders are chill. Some players are loot crazed, and will do what they think they can get away with to get loot.
---
I get 2 ores from the rich ones and 1 from the small ones. Nothing else, no exceptions.
---
welcome to r/classicwow
---
Can ylu  ot usr the system berd before greed looting option
---
Yeah this is nothing like that, basically this was your groups fault for releasing, not someone saying " highest roller wins" and then giving it to someone else. Your situation is just people messing up, not someone breaking a social contract

---
nah he's right, once layering is removed it will be way more fun.
---
Do the classic threat meters require everyone to have that addon to be able to see them? I tried downloading a threat meter early on in classic for tanking dungeons but my name was the only one that showed up - none of my groupmate's
---
So looking for randoms in a raid and not guildies or ?
---
Respect the druid code man üòÅ
---
Pug means Pick up group. Haven‚Äôt seen anyone answer you yet, so I figured I‚Äôd answer your question.
---
Herb/Enc until 265 and make the HOTM then drop Enc for Alch.
---
Or just have herb/enc for all time and just feed an alchemist.
---
I only played feral druid in wotlk, and liked it. So I rolled one again. I can agree with the tank being viable, but it does annoy me how needed few changes between vanilla and tbc were.
---
Tanking a boss is BORING. In 5mans you don't get enough rage to even spam swipe, it's just maul, maul, maul and keep ff/shout on. It's not much, but caring about lacerate stacks was at least something.
---
Also lack of cat swipe pretty much ruins cat dungeon running. While I've understood cat can do fine in raid bosses, it doesn't make me sense to sell myself as kitty for dungeons when I do terrible dmg during all packs and bring no cc. So if I tank the dung, people don't like me rolling on the dps gear that rogues want. This was so much simpler in wotlk when good geared druid was able to top dmg when they weren't useless in trash.
---
Double hitting with bash was another nice addition, but I suppose that was just a buff that isn't needed as we do have bear swipe.

---
They worked depending on your clout and guild relations, we had someone ninja loot our like 4th C'Thun kill, he had to server transfer because nobody on the server would touch him.
---
This is back when there was maybe 50 guilds with kills of Cthun total in Vanilla, so it wasn't hard to figure out he was a ninja even if he transferred, he was wearing like mediocre blues/purples and a Cthun Axe/ring.
---
why would anyone want to be in this guild lol
---
Well unfortunately the whiny children who haunt this sub and wow forums cried about timed loot trading with their silly ass #nochanges bullshit. Blizzard tried to use logic but it wasn't very effective. This is exactly what the classic community asked for. It fucking sucks but I don't blame blizzard for not doing anything.
---
It's looking healthy but this by no means people resubbed. If there's (for example) 10 layers of all zones on average and servers are full, if the population drops then bliz just has to reduce the number of layers to make the appearance of similar population. Until layers are gone, the server capacities mean very little. I for one hope (if they do this already) that they make layers a dynamic system that adjusts no of layers depending on current online players.
---
All they really gotta do to combat layering issues is make a layer switch only occur when in a major city or within xp range of the individual you are grouping with and even then, to take about 2 minutes out if combat to switch (removes spawn by layering abuse). I'm sure it's already in place or in the works
---
Yeah but clothies cant wear anything but cloth, so when all other classes go for it, it's not fair
---
Something you can start doing, is looking at the heal/mitigation per mana. You'll find that your lesser heals and heal spells have the best heal/mana spent. Instant cast spells like Renew or PW:Shield tend to have lower heal/mitigation per mana spent BUT they don't have the long cast time. Renew is nice after a pull to top off dps that took light damage, and then you can get to drinking faster. PW:Shield is clutch for when someone is near death, and you need more time to cast a longer more efficient spell, where the player would have died while casting otherwise. I'd never cast PW:Shield or Renew on a tank prior to a pull starting. PW:Shield, as you've read, causes threat issues which area already hard enough for tanks. Renew will cause heal threat (mobs will want to kill you) faster than the tank can spread threat around to multiple mobs. If you have a lesser heal or heal spell that does for example 130-190 healing, wait until the tank needs 190 or more, and then cast it. They will be at nearly full health, and you are being as efficient as you can be. If you find that after the cast finishes, they're at -190 ish again, then you start to spam the spell until that's not the case. If you find they're at -190+ then you're starting to fall behind and that's where a PW:Shield or Renew starts to help make up for the extra damage coming in.
---
I couldn‚Äôt care less about the number of runs you have done previously.  If I‚Äôm running a dungeon I want loot.  If I can‚Äôt roll on said loot because some jerk tries to reserve gear in a PUG I just won‚Äôt go.  Gear reservations are a guild activity not something to bring to LFG.
---
That's a lot less move speed. 
---
You're travelling a third slower than someone with a mount. Every 100 minutes you'd save an extra 20  minutes of travel time. That adds up.
---
To be fair, it's not just a healing trinket, it's straight BiS for all casters.
---
But since that's basically the only item a healer would want out of UBRS it's pretty scummy to prevent them from rolling.
---
Last Stand, Shield Wall, Shield Block. Though my first alt will be a prot Paladin.
---
Its a setting under the raid frames options
---
You think this is pain? To try to start our lockouts early, my guild leader asked me to respec to holy... at 56.  
---
"Dont worry, bro. I'll chain you through dungeons if you do this for us, and you'll mostly level at the same pace"  
---
That was 9 days ago. I'm lvl 59 now.  
---
I've had zero guild warriors agree to tank for me since, including said MT  
---
Questing as Holy is in fact the seventh circle of hell.
---
LOL as a tank, I will occasionally ask ench shams if they need a mana break (even if the healer is fine on mana) and they are are always like, "nah, I am good" and I always read it the way an out of shape person would say it mid-marathon, out of breath, panting hard between words.
---
I'm 27
---
The fuck kind of ass backwards logic is this
---
"If they don't explicitly tell you that they're going to ninja you and you get ninjad then it's your fault" no???
---
Yah rage generation is a extremely important, tanks in the beginning of a fight will always need more rage. Even with charge into defensive stances into berserker rage doesn't seem to be enough
---
There were less guilds clearing MC, and even less of them talking about it on widely traveled public forums.
---
Probably Arms/Fury into Prot I guess.
---
Definitely some neckbeard here. Especially at the mention that they have girlfriends like that has to do with anything
---
Here is a copy pasta from one of the members of the raid, thought it was funny, here it goes. 
---
First of all this is nothing short of exortion. You're only getting ONE side of the story and even then it's just a snippet. I can confirm. I was there and have the chatlogs to prove it. You're basically like the women who cry rape when they were the ones who got drunk and made a bad decision. SMH.
---
He was absolutely undeserving of it and I have the logs and meters to prove . When you join as a PUG, you work under the assumption that you are helping the guild progress. Guilds &gt; Pugs. Everyone knows that. If you have an issue join PUG raids. You are benefitting from our expertise and organizational skills. Not the other way around. Don't make me post the meters.
---
Also, lol @ the idiots who are giving us grief for finding pugs to fill the slot. We didn't need them, they needed us. Unlike APES or any of the idiotic poopsocking no life guilds who spend all day glued to their chair we have lives and girlfriends and jobs. We are a semi hard-core raiding guild. In time we will have enough members where we don't need to pick up scrubs but we were happy to give this guy am audition. Guess what. He failed.
---
You want purples? Impressive us. Do üëèyourüëè jobüëè. If you act like dead weight we will reward you accordingly. If you do your job you can roll. If you really impress us you might even get recruited. In this case the opposite happened. This guy was a scrub, and the officers decided we couldn't reward mediocrity. Of course being the girl he is, he decided to QQ to reddit instead of manning up and taking responsibility.
---
Also, the idea that a bunch of nerds on Reddit will get us blacklisted is completely laughable. Most of you don't even play on our server. Most of people on our server aren't on Reddit.
---
Your SJW attitude is hilarious at best and pathetic at its worst.
---
Thanks for the laughs- we are having a ball laughing at all you on Discord over all you Reddit nerds. Yeah ok have fun blacklisting us, idiots we're soooooo scared. My fave is the moron going on about some scrub rogue who dueled people. Really? You think that's gon scare us? You for real? üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
---
In short, this wasn't ninja, it was karma. Dont you reddit nerds know about that? QQ all you want but we're here to stay. Im sure Reddit being what it is you will downvote and hide my post but as an officer I felt obligated to give my 2 cents.
---
Desolace without a mount is brutal.  I had to do it since I ran out of quests but holy shit that is a ton of walking.
---
Surprise! 
---
For real though, sorry to hear.
---
I‚Äôm going to catch me that undead horse
---
tIps aPpreCiAted!!
---
Is this is telling me I need to kill 59x1.13 = 67 mobs to level from 59 to 60? That doesn't sound right.
---
I handle it as if I NEED an item I roll need and equip it as soon as I get it, anything else I roll greed or pass on. It's that simple, unless a premade group specifically makes it clear at the begining that someone has reserved X item and you ALL agree it is NOT ninja looting, if you need on gear you actually need regardless or value of the item, if it's a BOE or whatever.
---
This comment is extremely passive aggressive and I see no reason for it. You're not saying a single thing that isn't obvious or self-explanatory. Please don't comment further
---
well, sometimes a death in the transition from p2 to p3 is not your fault.
---
Just needs time.
---
No one cares about their choice to do that, don't be stupid. What we care about is how the mentality has creeped into the minds of people who lack dungeon fundamentals and they end up fucking their groups over.
---
Depends if you plan to Feral Tank! If not, Herb/Alch is a great combo to be honest. It helps you solo, it helps you in pve and pvp, and it‚Äôs good for making $$
---
Destro and drain tank go together nicely.  Getting shadow burn early will allow you to do tons of damage.  Then the affliction tree helps a lot with the final talent giving you a flat 10% shadow damage bonus.  Other early talents help a lot like instant corruption, amplify curse, siphon life, fel concentration and curse of exhaustion.  Just really good quality of life improvements.
---
Damn man :-( my map will never be the same
---
Surprise Mechanics.
---
So sore! Waiting for your push on stormwind, we won‚Äôt be making excuses
---
Search for "broker" style addons. TitanBar is a display addon for broker plugins. It comes with a few stock ones, but there are broker plugins made by others that will integrate into TitanBar.
---
Drama's going to happen, but there's multiple submissions about this one incident. It's overkill.
---
Yeah, but when it's a situation like OP's where he wants to see the difference in his threat generation then it'll work fine with just him. I imagine lots of guilds will probably pick a threat meter for everyone to use so everybody is on the same page, though.
---
What a beauty, Congratulations.
---
Feel your pain OP. Started on launch day and quit sometime in 2009 due to ninja guild looter. Had top dps too. 
---
The experience was great but that reason is not worth my time coming back. Hope things get better and you run with some nice and honest players from here on out. Best of luck! 
---
Blizzard should implement a sort of PUG mode. Before entering the raid a prompt comes up to vote for PUG mode (or something of that nature) and no loot master. So whoever wins the roll outright, wins the loot. That way there won't be ninja looters because everyone agreed beforehand. To deter people who try to get carried or barely does anything, there is some implementation of minimum dps or healing in order to roll. I'm sure they can figure something out if this becomes the trend again. Just my two cents.
---
You reslly think 99% of players go to the blacklist every day and everytime they want to group up? Not q chance.
---
People were really no lifing for the first couple weeks, possible people are just playing a more healthy number of hours per week.
---
Lol. Thought the same thing...the whole priest thing in the title didn't register for me either
---
Death to all allianc.... er I mean congratulations!
---
Pixelated?
---
Truth
---
Except that druid would have most likely leaned the other way if a freezing band dropped and a mage wanted to get it or if stockade pauldrons dropped and a war wanted to get it. Going against the accepted convention without discussing the loot rules at the start of the group is nothing but being a self serving prick.
---
I have evidence of u/bookofshadowslock begging me to delete a screenshot of his post he deleted. Why would an innocent guild need that to be deleted? Because it calls them out to be ninja's posted by their very own guildie u/bookofshadowslock.
---
So, the way those things work is that you have to hit with that weapon. When you're shifted into Bear Form or Cat Form, you're not actually attacking with your weapon. You're attacking with your paws and claws. Therefor, the weapon procs do nothing.
---
Whatever helps your fragile in check mate.
---
Hope to fuck you're wrong.
---
I agree on the policy that you should only roll need on a BoE if you're going to use it. Usually there aren't ninjas, and if it's an upgrade it doesn't matter if it's BoP or BoE, person who needs it should have it.
---
Are you me?
---
Play music when you run dungeons then so you‚Äôre not sitting in total silence. If people try to talk, I‚Äôll respond. But sometimes I just don‚Äôt feel up to making conversation. It just depends. This happens with retail and classic. Join a guild - and I mean an actual guild. Not one where they just invite randos who never talk. Join the discord and party with them. Much more fun that way
---
I undercut more so my stuff actually sells.
---
If I undercut 1 copper then someone inevitably undercuts me a few minutes later.
---
Well, depends on what you want to spend your money on. Thrash blade will probably last you until UBRS.
---
This was absolutely satisfying to watch
---
My tauren who wants a wolf thanks you
---
... and I hope alliance is there to defend so we can have a huge fight otherwise it's not fun and wont feel accomplished. Sorry I like to actually work for my achievements
---
4 10 man onys is better than 2 20 mans
---
It's not about gold at all, man. Don't be greedy.
---
It‚Äôs how it was in Classic, so...
---
This shit destroyed guilds.
---
Get off a pvp server if you're helping the other faction. I keep seeing posts like, "I was so nice, then they attacked". Uhh that's the game bros.
---
If that shaman had even half a brain he would earth shock the succubus or tremor totem and it would have been gg
---
Yeah definitely, just haven't found any better weapon yet.
---
Yeah, just make it a priority to get a wand ASAP and a damaging gear set so you can swap out any exclusively bonus-to-healing pieces.
---
Bro what im telling you is theres no point. Mages have an arsenal of spells that can be used close to a Hunter where i cant kill you. You might be able to kill me, you might be better than me, but i cant tell you how many mages ive killed over stupid decisions they‚Äôve made. 
---
If you‚Äôre doing it for fun thats one thing and I respect that because its funny, but killing the pet first is definitely never going to be meta
---
Ih for tanking and 2h with frostbrand for solo content. Keeping both weapon skills relevant is something you have to keep an eye out for though. For that reason I will often 1h+shield while doing solo content too.
---
For the 1h I would recommend going with a faster weapon when possible.
---
Why would a mage want that staff? No spell dmg, no int, only stamina and spirit with a second arcane intellect buff? Hard pass
---
Early raid tier for casters is really bad unfortunately.
---
I love that it's not actually a meme that there's way more actual retards on horde for some reason
---
I really want to know what the explanation is for that
---
Nothing wrong with the feral spec, its just much harder to get geared up.

even if I downloaded them manually the first around?

No changes

You‚Äôre not wrong mate. Currently brainstorming for any other names that were offensive maybe around 150 years ago

When should I start looking for a guild? I am a lvl 30 druid who intends to spend a lot of time doing PVP at max as the feral HotW NS spec. In raids and dungeons I prefer the tanking or off tanking role. With that role being a bit limited I want to secure a spot early, but I also recognize that it will be a while before I hit lvl 60 and guilds that already have people at max are likely not going to save a spot for me. Should I just wait to find a guild?
---
I'm going to stay 31 shadow as long as I can and still keep healing dungeons too.  See how long it lasts...
---
I am currently 51 so I have 11/0/31 and I'm putting the rest of the points into disc.  Inner Focus is a great 'oh shit' button and I have points into Imp For and stronger shields.  I've had no problems healing Princess runs and other boss fights.  I'm also Alchemist so I have plenty of pots available when I need them.
---
I'll be healing ST soon and on into Blackrock...  I'll see if I can make this work or not.  
---
For raiding, yeah sure I'll go 31/20/0 for PI and some holy stuff.  But shadow is awesome for leveling/grinding.
---
My apologies that you decided to play an mMorpg and decided to not socialize.
---
Enjoy swtors new dlc, or maybe Guild Wars 2... nah you'll go back to fortnite season 83!

You seem either angry from previous experience or just very very dense. I can't decide which one though.
---
Is there a rule of thumb for how much higher level you need to be than a dungeon‚Äôs average level to solo it? If it helps, I‚Äôm a feral druid.
---
Is there any reason to solo a dungeon besides helping lower level get through it? Is it efficient gold/mats?
---
Eat also gets you Stan and spirit buffs vs drink

You must never go there. That's where the tryhard noobs live.

This is why i see a lot of people stop playing from 30-50. It's a grind. But in my opinion, this is where the magic of wow is.
---
I only have one beef with spell cleaves... The fucking name. It's AOE. They took a 3 letter acronym and made it 2 words, one of which barely manages to define it!
---
i did download most of them from curseforge, but manually. Will twitch app automatically update them?
---
It did happen in vanilla, but it wasn't common. That said, I havent encountered anyone reserving items in Classic yet on my server (not level 60 yet tho).
---
You say that, but I have seen people turn their noses up at weapons with higher damage ranges simply because of the weapon speed. It boggles the mind.
---
Nah, game genie
---
Rude
---
&gt;Sure, but I'm not sure why people who don't like the content in classic wow would want to jump onboard classic wow. 
---
I for one would have liked to raid and maybe finish what I never managed in vanilla (Naxx) and to play a bit PvP in Battlegrounds with a different class. Both aren't possible right now and I will certainly not be around when they are.
---
Can you explain what you mean by "can't translate what he wants to say to text"? If he doesn't speak english, can he at least read it? If not, I'm willing to try to help. I'm alliance on ashkandi server.
---
I went through the same thing. I play on Whitemane and people are always camping it. Decided to buy the pattern on the AH and made about 35g yesterday just selling bags.
---
Why is everyone calling your server Whipemane then? P sure you guys all suck and cant down any raids
---
Lol
---
Is there any tips for killing 2-3 mobs at a time? I feel like I struggle at it sometimes. Currently level 24. What level should these mobs be when I wanna juggle them around. I have been starting to drain tank as of late with an imp for more damage which has been better.
---
Enh sham can go beyond meme status if you're geared right and understand the mechanics, but it takes a lot more effort/consumes to do so. They won't be at the top, but they won't be near the bottom either.
---
Should have just told them you respecced and just healed as shadow
---
I‚Äôm currently lvl 32 with enchanting on 110 and tailoring 180. Do you think it‚Äôs worth it to drop ench and go herbalism? Or will I waste too much time farming low lvl herbs?
---
The worst feeling in the world is mounting up and getting perma-stunned to death by a rogue.
---
But you are missing a key part of this.  They don‚Äôt need it.  If they did, they would have bought it already.  The only reason they are needing is to save their gold.  What is the difference then if it‚Äôs your gold or theirs?
---
Is there a good way to find out which weapons I should be grabbing for my current level?
---
Reason I'm asking is I'm trying to switch from a dagger spec to a sword spec on my lvl 23 rogue. I sold the Wingblade a while back, which is the one I see most suggested. I'm going to try to grab Outlaw Sabre soon, but that still leaves me without a second sword and I'm not sure what exactly I should be doing...sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm fairly new.
---
I knew people did this on purpose lol. Intentionally all mass huddle next to the flight path and sit with their animals just to troll
---
Horde does this all the time in duskwood
---
What? I was just repeating what you said...
---
Classic is back but since server populations are limited to the one server you are on, stuff like this means you can know not to group with them
---
Gotcha.
---
Ah I see. Yea the guild is very cult-y it seems.
---
When you join as a PUG in a guild run you are definitely not there to help the guild gather loot/progress for free.
---
A pug should always be part of a /roll for their MS regardless of their performance unless you get told in advance you get no gear.
---
The only case guildies get priority is if you tell people who join as pugs in advance that it's guild prio. You seem to have fucked up badly and are basically mad at people for calling you out.
---
I really feel like the stigma is pretty much gone. I have a bit of a reputation for being a Feral tank, but I get invites all the time for tanking.
---
And as far as raiding, I lead a raid group with 2 Feral tanks (I'm one). We haven't had a lot of Might drop, but the MT has gotten all of what has and is still gearing very fast. I just now had to select a 4th tank (Warrior) for backup when someone is out.
---
We're 1 Phasing Rag and dropping Domo with 0 deaths.
---
Feral Tanks are great (I just wish I could farm mara as well as Balance/Heals...)
---
Yes/no. A fair bit of this grumping is due to private server economies being quite different. They were actually more robust, it was generally easier to make money.
---
They do already lol
---
I had a guildy literally do this to me during a mostly pug UBRS. Rend down? No sword? Insta hearth
---
He got reamed in chat and kept trying to rationalize it before he gquit
---
It gets better in the 30s when you get Sweeping Strikes, Whirlwind, and Windfury. You can legit pull 200+ DPS at 36 topping the charts with lots of numbers on the screen.
---
According to the 95% logs, playing Seal Fate right now puts you around where feral druids are, so maybe 50%-60% effectiveness compared to Combat?
---
In the 2years (!) played I had in vanilla, back then, I hadn‚Äôt had a single BoE Epic drop on me outside any dungeon. So yeah, confirmation bias coupled with a way bigger Server population than then I‚Äôd say
---
You will get a better upgrade really soon.
---
I re-read what I wrote and noticed for friendly, I put friendly instead of neutral which made no sense because this would remove the PvP aspect of the game. So that was my bad. Now I'm curious if you see it differently?

It's definitely a bit of a slog for a while, I think it really picked up for me when I got Sweeping Strikes (21pt arms talent) and was able to tactically fight two mobs at a time. Then it picked up even more when I got Whirlwind (level 36), and I am having a ton of fun now that I have my mount and Mortal Strike (level 40).
---
A tip that worked for me is try only doing quests 3-4 levels lower than you. This allows you to still get a good amount of experience from the mobs, but your hit chance is way higher while theirs is way lower.
---
Rig Wars is the quest in Org.
---
^ that. 
---
It‚Äôs already in the game.
---
If you close/resolve/delete a service desk ticket, there's no reason for a CS rep to waste time on it. 
---
Especially when the context is about a "warning".
---
Is it rare? I got it on my first run
---
It's certainly very good for orc.
---
Feral tank here. Tanked through every 5 man as well as all of MC and Onyxia in Classic without breaking a sweat. Warriors excel on some fights, druids on others, but they're all doable as both. 
---
Warriors when you need mitigation, druids when you need threat. I'd generally recommend guilds get 2-3 prot warriors, 1 fury tank and 1-2 feral tanks.
---
There's a few fights in Naxx that I wouldn't recommend doing as a bear and Nefarian in BWL that I definitely wouldn't recommend.
---
Awesome info - thanks!
---
Well.. Yeah you do need those as a mage. It's one of the required items if your going into serious raiding.
---
I‚Äôm here for the Mario Paint music

Oh, right, ofc

"I made this!!! Well not that part. Or the other part. BUT I SMOOSHED THEM TOGETHER!"

Do you have to do it every time you log in?
---
Why don't we have a Druid tank Rag? *Hacks!*    
---
I got 13,000 AC! *Nerf!*    
---
Shadow Form okay? *No!*    
---
Hehe I'm gonna do it anyway. *Hell no!*
---
I'm actually interested in the cockney version, because I find cockney stuff hilarious
---
Perfect answer thank you!
---
Wait until they pull a mob or 2
---
I dont know in what universe you raid 5 times a week. MC and Ony is easily done in one night.
---
That being said, the guy that only come once everything three week (read once every three MC clean) gets item but comes after the guy that actually put more of his personal time into the guild. If we follow your logic, the casual has even more chance of getting loots because probably guildmate with same class already looted tier gear. So he should get the already owned gear plus same chance as other to get bis weapons?
---
I've seen people suggest going back and completing every quest lvl 45 and up.
---
Good gold rewards with occasional equipment you can sell.
---
I'm not 60 yet so have not tried this myself.
---
You should make that your background on your pc
---
*shudders in prot warrior*
---
Boom roasted
---
Tailoring you ONLY level up for the Robe craft it and dump tailor for something more useful - so is it worth it for you to drop one of your prof, spend some gold and/or maybe half a day to level up Tailor (also have to buy of farm up the Robe pattern)?
---
Meme specs are fine as long as you don't expect me to carry you through a dungeon.
---
If you're playing balance druid, please for the love of god try to out dps the tank, please. If you cannot then you're a hindrance to the group.
---
I had a rogue in Eastern Plaguelands try to gank me and took too long circling around to the back of my felsteed so when they did open a single hit went off and my felsteed raced off into the sunset xD
---
No, but playing alliances might. ;)
---
It's not like you can't do it yourself.  But the default for auctionator is dumb and does stuff like 5s undercuts when you literally only need to undercut 1c.  So stuff really ramps down in price, so often you see people blindly listing items for less than vendor value.
---
Umm.  You are the brain dead one here.  If they needed that item, they would have bought it already.  They wouldn‚Äôt be hoping for a super rare world drop.  At that point, we aren‚Äôt talking about an item at all, we are talking one persons pocketbook against another persons pocketbook.
---
It‚Äôs even better than tier 2 unless you have the full tier 2 8/8 set
---
Oh right, restorative removes every single type of debuff that can be applied in game by players.
---
Shitty then too, report it, take screenshots for proof.  I'd say name and shame them but apparently I had the wrong idea then.
---
Has no benefit for a lock either, it's a trash epic beyond some use in pvp.
---
Why do you have to explain anything? "It's in WoW," explanation over..
---
How do you defeat an OP class that can spam one button furiously while you have to devise and execute a complex strategy based on the situation?
---
I consider myself lucky if I can ever touch a lock once with my weapon. At that point I'm usually dealing with health issues or have lost interest because I haven't had control over my toon for so long. 
---
Save your dignity and avoid them. People that play locks have no interest in a fair fight. Just make it boring for them.
---
Its like a false rape accusation. Even if you defend yourself with hard evidence your name will still get smeared and everyone will hate you.
---
I wanted to downvote this until I remembered you just copy pasta'd.
---
Joining a pug with group loot would be AIDS. Wrath I only did pugs and maybe joined a few guild runs, not once did I see group loot unless someone accidentally forgot to put it on ML. Priority is always MS&gt;OS&gt;DE with MS being the spec you went into the group as.
---
Took less than 10 for my hunter to get it. BIS and triggering people everywhere.
---
Thrash blade can be used in MC if you been unlucky with other drops. I'd say go for it. Keep in mind enemies in MC will be resistant to fire damage.
---
That ninja defenitly came by &lt;surprise&gt;
---
Counterargument: I don't trust that random people in my group will actually make good use of an item, whereas if somebody buys it on AH you're sure.
---
 For example, I've run into a lot of druids who heal, but also need on various gear that is good for ferals because they want to at least have the option of tanking... however, the truth is that for many of them that won't happen often if at all, because there's generally only 1 feral tank spot in a 40 man raid, and for dungeons a lot of people are distrustful of anything but a warrior tank and/or the druid player may come to find that healing is a more laidback job than leading the group while tanking. If such a person expected people to pass on Warden Staff to him because he's a 'hybrid' or 'feral mainspec', a lot of groups probably would (or they would be mad at whoever needed against him to sell the item), but the truth is the person would probably not use the item much or to its full potential, and the supply of Warden Staffs on the AH would diminish, driving prices up, and making it harder for the dedicated, serious feral tank players to get the important bis staff.
---
I see the same thing happening with the tailoring bop recipes all the time - some caster, like 50% of caster players, happen to be a tailor, and expects the group to pass on boe patterns... well, maybe he will craft the bop pattern, but chances are he'll wait until he has his epic mount first once he realizes how expensive the mats are (and he may not even be 300 tailoring yet in the first place), and perhaps even decide that the incremental upgrade the expensive craft represents over an easier to get item is not worth the money. In the worst case he may have needed the pattern, learned it, and ended up not using it at all, making it a terrible waste, whereas someone willing to drop 100-200 gold for it on the AH is certain to actually craft it.
---
Honestly don't see why people don't realize that expensive BoEs should be needed by all unless the group has agreed to reserve the item from someone who is actively out trying to get it. It is equally greedy to expect people to pass on something worth a lot of money to them, just so you can save the same amount of money, as it is to want the money in the first place.
---
Tough question and im too low at lvl 27 to answer. Some zones like silverpine are chock full of herbs yet right now in Hillsbrad it is really barren. Farming anything without a mount in classic is a pain. It would take a day or two of farming to catch up but alch is more desirable in guilds than tailor and herb is way cheaper/easier to level than ench. Being able to always have potions on deck is a big benefit when leveling.
---
Because with a combination of DKP and loot council, people can still roll on other loot besides a short list of uber important items. If someone doesn't want to attend a raid unless they can get bindings, I don't really want them in my raid anyway.
---
Any advice for me (60 warrior) and my friend (50 druid)  trying to duo Princess in Maraudon?  We get her down to 30% when things start to fall apart.  Thanks.
---
u/sundebtw thanks for the pasta lmao
---
He was absolutely undeserving of it and I have the logs and meters to prove . When you join as a PUG, you work under the assumption that you are helping the guild progress. Guilds &amp;gt; Pugs. Everyone knows that. If you have an issue join PUG raids. You are benefitting from our expertise and organizational skills. Not the other way around. Don't make me post the meters.
---
A dps warrior blowing rage on thunderclap swaps and generating threat with sunder is very, very non-ideal - the latter in particular is extremely likely to pull threat. Fury warriors generate massive threat through damage and have no way to dump it - using extra threat abilities is a huge no-no.
---
Bro you can farm Mara same way as Hunter/Warlocks. 50g/h is doable :)
---
To be fair though, you did walk into that with both eyes open.
---
Didn't say that it wasn't, but I undercut by 1c manually, and auctionator is a % based by default on tiers.  Therefore, a lot of gathering materials (cloth/leather/herbs) all get big 1-5s cuts everytime someone lists a stack of them, do that for a bunch of auctions and you can drop the prices real fast.
---
The stam has a lot more benefit for a lock then it does for a mage.
---
Yes actually. The 2 warriors who rage-quit after I told them to go google it post run to educate themselves before raging.
---
It's not a reservation. It's just about not being a selfish dick. Nobody would be complaining if your friend played a hunter and rolled need, that'd be fine. But agility is a tertiary stats for warriors.
---
Pretty scummy. I see OPs frustration. Thanks everyone!
---
Rouge is for your cheeks, not swords!
---
Short? Toilet.
---
The reason it takes two presses to equip the dagger and cast backstab is becaouse  swapping weapons infight forces a gcd (global cooldown). So what the macro does is trigger the first action, in this cast the equip command and when it tries to cast Backstab it cant because there is a cooldown. You can try it out of combat and you'll see there wont be a cooldown.
---
 And no, there is no way to make a macro that you dont have to press twice for this action because of gcd.
---
It can't just be me that thinks that classic is full of weak cry babies, can it? This sub is full of people that seem like they can't handle the slightest adversity
---
If it is a BoE, you roll need unless stated otherwise before the run. Doesn't matter if it's a Warden Staff and you have a feral druid/Krol Blade and a rogue/Freezing Band and a mage/Flask Recipe and an Alchemist. This is the best way to go about it so that nobody feels like they didn't get a chance at an item. You are not entitled to BoE drops ever.
---
Super late but they were originally intended to be capable of melee and the official guidebook at launch described priests as having "weak melee capacity" (Which is notable as warlocks and mages didn't have that note)
---
A lot of people speculate that the Discipline tree was originally intended be a monk of sorts, similar to the ones found in Scarlet Monastery
---
*Come, Barnaby. We have WORK to do*
---
How did you get to this from a pic of roof exploiting?
---
Why do you think this? I used to multivox 5 chars for a few months. It was mostly because retail had nothing interesting left for me to do. There was no challenge - so my new challenge became making a self reliant multiboxing setup. It was a lot of fun and never did I care about some advantage, as you put it. I didn't wpvp or gold farm, I just had some fun in a unique way.
---
You're depending too much on good will. All it takes is one ninja to need and drop party for you to feel burned and wonder how that could have been prevented. Just needing on them all prevents that. After everyone needs, the winner is free to ask around if anyone really needs it and will equip it right now.
---
Dominos actionbars can set to only show mouse over
---
Does this count as ninja? In ZF a BoE epic dagger dropped. I‚Äôm a rogue and specialize in daggers. It was a huge upgrade. I Needed immediately. I mentioned how I‚Äôll definitely use this. The tank needed on it a minute later so my buddy also needed it. My buddy won and gave it to me. I‚Äôm now using it.
---
This is precisely why I am leveling a warrior as my main. I am arms for leveling but throw on a sword n board for tanking a dungeon. I can build my group the way i see fit and not have to get stuck with "spellcleavezerglawls" people.
---
Is there any source you could cite to confirm this?
---
Warlocks have zero defense versus a rogue.   Just kick their fear and you win.  If you don't have kick KS.  If you don't have KS gogue.  If you don't have gogue blind.  If you don't have blind vanish.  If you don't have any of those then I can't help you..
---
i love desolace, it is...desolate.
---
&gt; IIRC you get regular silk bandages from the trainer, and you need a book for the heavy kind, though I may be wrong
---
That's correct, though the Silk Bandages can only be bought when you're 150/150, so you're technically "wasting" skill-ups if you make any bandages before buying the book.
---
What Ui is that? I really like it.
---
&gt; 1 month of free game time
---
That's the Blizzard of old.
---
That‚Äôs not good enough.
---
&gt;Any 5 people coordinated could kill a 5 man multi boxer easily
---
Absolutely. You are correct. 
---
&gt;The only thing this helps is 1 guy get a bunch of chars to level 60 at the same time
---
Yes. It helps against people who are walking around solo or paired. They have a very low chance of winning. But that's just talking pvp. It helps a ton for rep farming and gold farming.
---
Question about professions while leveling.
---
I'm level 39. I've been leveling skinning and herbalism, both of which are at 225. Since I made this character, I've saved every herb, skin, and cloth. My plan was to keep herb/skinning until I have my mount (or epic mount), then drop both and power level alchemy and tailoring.
---
But is there even a point in leveling alchemy if I drop herbalism?
---
That's how you leveled so quickly... you hacked time itself.
---
ü¶Ä it‚Äôs 50/50 ü¶Ä

She's probably as woefully sad as I am. Sometimes you do everything to raise the kids right and they still disappoint. Just ask my parents.
---
they are explicitly against the rules and for good reason. i already reported this post.
---
I'd happily take tank needing more healing if it means not having to heal the entire group
---
Didn't keep a count of my runs, but I got so tired of losing the roll for Hypnotic Blade at the end of SM Lib that I offered my PUG a gold apiece if they'd pass on it.  4G was expensive, but a small price to move on with my life.
---
Thank you. I probably should of mentioned I'm from the UK so I imagine shipping would be the same price haha, thanks anyway (I'll look for same chair in a UK retailer)
---
Above comments already excluded this as a progression guild mindset. Progression guilds are where people find it actually acceptable to do that sort of weighted loot table. Outside of a progression guild loot should be free to roll if you need it. I didnt come on a pug run of MC to donate the loot i want to others out of the kindness of my heart. I came to have a chance to roll on that loot
---
i tested it out and was able to switch to 3 different layers all within 3 minutes....
---
You sound like a good raider that wasn't close friends with the guild leadership. That's why you got treated like that; those players were twats.
---
General rule of thumb:
---
\-DE all green armor pieces
---
\-Vendor all 'weapons'
---
\-Vendor all Blues until 30's, afterwards compare prices of shards vs the vendor value of the item.
---
If you want to be more efficient (and really just nerdy) - can do something like I did plug in and update the prices for Enchanting mats into a spreadsheet and the factor the DE chances into each tier of item for a estimated average DE value.
---
Level 36 here. What weapons should I be prioritizing?
---
I‚Äôm hearing 1H + offhand is best for warlock? I‚Äôve been using the same staff since Deadmines :)
---
Blizzard deems a lot of questionable behavior appropriate.
---
It doesn't make any sense actually and isn't a justification.
---
If you vendor 95% of your things, don't buy ALL your Class Skills and have the Vendor Price Addon. You'll have it around lvl 44-45 :D
---
Imagine seething, luhmao
---
One night my buddy and I got bored of our mid-level 40 shaman and rogue characters on our PVE server and decided to venture into the uncharted PVP territory. 
---
Instead of going head first, we treaded lightly into an RPPVP for the luls, and ended up picking tauren druid and shaman. He chose the name, "Plsmilkme" while I went with "Dontmilkhim"
---
As soon as we entered the realm, the duel began, and at least 4 or 5 other taurens that were just starting in the area got to witness the epic battle that lasted until the duel force ended (bc of time) with me being victorious. All that remains unfortunately is this picture commemorating the battle of the milk. 
---
Dont milk him. https://imgur.com/gallery/srdJ8lt

I would like to see balance, but with most raiding guilds there are 3-5x more warriors.  It's Mostly Mages, but Warriors are a close second to a lot of raiding guilds.    The reason that happens is Warriors are just as good as rogues, at DPS,  they can wear more gear, and for horde being able to use axes is HUGE (Orcs get +5 to axes).
---
No taunts. Once the aggro leaves, it doesn't come back.
---
Details! shows specs.
---
Reads like a copypasta.
---
Or I'm gonna step on it?
---
The fact of the matter is the guy joined a raid where master looter was the loot rules, doesn‚Äôt matter what is or isn‚Äôt said loot master decides.
---
We have all been on the end of getting shit ninjad it sucks but move on
---
This sub feels like it's one half memes and art about Horde killing Alliance and one half clips of Horde players tripping over their own dicks in pvp.
---
I just started fishing recs and made about 20g in an hour. The auction house is fucked but if your patient you can make some good money. Wish I knew this when I was grinding  for my mount before.
---
This. So much this. 
---
From what I have read you did nothing wrong. If they have a /roll system that's how it works. My guild used DKP - you earned points for being in a raid and for killing bosses - then you used those points for bidding on items. 
---
It was funny the paladins were brutal. They would but against each other and drive up the price of each piece of armor. My fellow druids would inspect each other's armor and always agree to give it to the person for whom it was the best upgrade - they would get it for the minimum amount of points. XD fun times
---
your word play made you seem extremely cocky which people dont react to nicely. This guy said it but didnt say "as a professional myself let me take the wind out of your sails" 
---
bet youre fun at parties
---
That's what I did. There was still plenty of PvP it just wasn't 100% of the time. I could actually go at least 5 minutes without fighting someone lol
---
Another chance to get your house hit my lightning and fry your hard drive?
---
I will post my kill times on Monday.
---
I‚Äôm leveling a Druid, was planning to go resto at 60. I am currently 57 and still get random invites to come tank by default, never to heal.
---
Sometimes while I‚Äôm inside a dungeon I‚Äôll get an invite to tank.
---
Gotcha, good to know, Warrior will be the next toon I level after my two mains are at 60, so good to get this info now :)
---
GM's don't need screenshots
---
They can offer to buy it from the person who wins....  I don‚Äôt see why you should get your cake (item) and eat it too (gold) just because you can equip.  Everyone rolls on saving a gold grinding session, you so you don‚Äôt have to buy it, and they can sell it.  Once this is established, there isn‚Äôt an argument you can make for need over greed because even need is greed.
---
I mean mostly warriors and mages *is* the meta raid comp.
---
I can see how that could be misconstrued as being elitist. Wasn't my intention.  The people who are saying I am a douche are likely the same people who would kick someone who is underperforming  out of party without a word of warning or explanation. 
---
I saw a teaching opportunity, I guess I failed.  At the end of the day I am glad OP is enjoying classic.
---
The amount of people here who haven't seen "world of roguecraft" is depressing. Goes into great detail about that staff.
---
Get improved Imp in Demonology and Instant corruption in affliction then go heavy in destruction. Your burst damage potential is quite insane with immolation &gt; conflag &gt; shadow burn &gt; searing pain
---
Min/Maxers will say this isn‚Äôt efficient, which is true, but it‚Äôs really fun and exciting to burst mobs/opposite faction down with 4 spells, sometimes less with lucky crits
---
Yeah I think offspec stuff and recipes are different. I don't trust people at all either because it only takes 1 dickhead to ruin a group's thing. I'm talking about stuff the player can equip right that moment that's going to make his or her day. 
---
I suppose everybody has their preferences. I appreciate the social aspect of WoW more than any other, and I'd be quite happy to pass in this situation, it's nice to see people happy after a low chance drop they've been waiting for. That's kinda part of the fun to me. Bit mushy I know but oh well.
---
Anyway, obviously most people seem to disagree with me, so surely best thing is just to make this clear from the start if someone's BiS drops from the dungeon you're about to clear so that this situation doesn't arise?
---
Cute squished faced dog

It's been a long time but I think demo shout only gives reasonable agro the first application, no?

You learn silk bandages from the first aid trainer. Heavy silk bandages and first aid past 225 come from books in Dustwallow Marsh.

His current youtube channel is BruceWillakers but he also uses Rawb.tv and UnforgottenRealms
---
There's an option called master looter that gives all gear to the raid leader. Everyone else uses /roll and the raid leader gives them the gear. It's supposed to stop people rolling on gear they can't use or someone else needs more. Also some guilds use a point system to add to rolls (show up to the most raids get x points each time, so if a piece of gear you've wanted for a month drops and you've been there every week you can get it...it's more complex but that's the gist). This time it backfired because the guild sucks.
---
Take their hp to 0 before yours goes to 0
---
Why would there be 60000 people next to you if they increased the amount of servers?
---
Crushing blows being on a boss's hit table means you can just wipe and not be able to do anything about it.
---
My old raiding guild didn't even let warriors MT unless they were uncrushable.
---
Not to mention when u pull Ony aggro u want to run to run to where main tank normally stands.

Get illusionary rod fro SM.  Will hold you over until you can get the 1H from Mara

Check out Secretlab. I had a problem with the opposite of being a big Neanderthal, but their titan model is best chair I‚Äôve owned. A little pricey, but worth every penny. They have a sizing chart to recommend a chair to your specs. Super easy assembly as well! Make the investment in yourself if you are gaming to comfort is definitely worth it.
---
I swear I‚Äôm not sponsored... I‚Äôm just really happy with my purchase :)

I tend to avoid the Blizzard forums like Mexican water and GM vehicles.
---
Doubt it'll become standard. Many feels their time and effort is worth more than someone else's. Had this rogue who needed on everything because he was *carrying us through BRD* when we were all 58+. Needless to say the group didnt last long. Ego trips and greed are the standard in 2019.
---
He‚Äôs native English speaker idk what it‚Äôs called he can think and say just fine he just can‚Äôt write or type what he‚Äôs thinking also he can‚Äôt read off a page and say it aloud but he can ran read something then tell you what it said right after he reads it.
---
Esfand would like to have a word with you
---
This is broken for Classic when I used it earlier this month, might have been updated since.
---
Deal.
---
As others have said, it's about leather vs plate.
---
But also, bears aren't as gear reliant as prot warriors. Practically speaking, that is. In reality bears are totally dependant on a single piece of gear: Manual Crowd Pummelers. But since the bear can grind them themselves from Gnomergan it's really more of a consumable. Each has 3 charges.
---
When you use up a charge it gives the bear so much threat that even DPS that outgear them don't have to gimp their damage output.
---
20 minutes while in the waiting room is hardly the whole day. I play on mankrik as horde. I just hate witch hunting

Cloth turn ins?

If you roll need on all BoP, that's a quick way to get yourself kicked from the group and blacklisted.
---
Name and shame! Wooo!
---
Always know there's going to be some great, intelligent insight when OP starts out with an analogy shaming rape victims.
---
Discussion doesn‚Äôt always have to be an argument, he‚Äôs asking a question, no need to get hostile 
---
I hate the ‚Äústop crying‚Äù posts, yes people complain when they feel an injustice, why is it so wrong that they look to the community to share ideas on how to better the situation? 
---
Isn‚Äôt that the whole point of forums to discuss aspects of the game and offer possible solutions to problems?
---
And yes pve servers are great for people who like to pve, but a lot of people enjoy pvp, and though highly unlikely to ever have a balanced pvp server. What do we lose by discussing possible balance options?
---
If it makes you feel any better I accidentally greeded and lost this item without know it's importance on my warrior.
---
I suppose it could be better to open the ticket as it means you understand that there is a chance and they‚Äôll maybe more likely offer a name change. I‚Äôve only received 24 hours which implies I‚Äôll get a name change after that time.
---
I actually don't have a problem with that if it's understood up front.  The guild I raided MC with reserved Bindings for a couple key raiders who we all depended on (and liked) so there wasn't drama when they dropped.
---
It's when Bindings drop and THEN the GM informs the raid that they're master-looting it... that's when the problems start.
---
Hydraxian and Argent Dawn if you raid.
---
Hands are sweaty mom's spaghetti,  learn 2 prntscrn noob
---
That doesn't really fix it. Only the good people would actually do that.
---
It's not like I've never had an item ninjaed. I just prefer to approch the world as being a good place, and sometimes being disappointed, rather than assume people are untrustworthy and take precautions.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that I feel diffrently than you do.
---
I think hypnotic blade + the offhand from the level 35 quest is better. Same boss.
---
What is this Epic Axe you people are drooling over?
---
&gt; I mean it is in the like top six belts or something for you. 
---
yeah, not even close
---
It was on master loot I guess and the guidleader can assign it later on to who he thinks should have or normally who rolls highest using /roll.
---
I think?
---
Nano boost?
---
Rivenspike is pre-raid BiS MH for Orc Fury warriors per the Fight Club discord.
---
Many people tell me loot council is great and I agree
---
Until it isn't

Then it's a hilarious dumpster fire of drama and nerd rage

I resubbed for a year and i have ganked like In every zone  Even Azshara! This is true pvp TRUE WORLD PVP!
---
Life lesson right there.
---
Dick warlock is canon
---
Hopefully an ex for trying to control you due to a sound file in a game.
---
What? There's plenty of advantages depending on the class. The offhand is considered very valuable in PvP. Not only that, they could help other guildies farm rep faster as well.
---
They are getting rep FASTER. They get the rep times before other people that are doing it solo, and they can farm without worrying about 1-2 other people killing them. It's quite clearly an advantage.
---
About to start tanking early dungeons and I can't imagine going in there with a 2H as a lot of people recommend. Yeah I get that it's more threat generation, but damage mitigation should be top priority. The dungeons shouldn't be THAT easy.
---
But when will then be? If no one hoarded, then it would be within days/weeks of most players reaching 60 . Because so many are hoarding, that could be months after that mark.
---
Until guild officers mysteriously have a slower decay rate, get random point awards just for logging in, and the guild leader decides (the day of the raid where his trinket drops) to re-calculate the way points for depositing mats/food/flasks are distributed.
---
Also fun - "mandatory" alt raids where some characters gain points for their mains, others *lose* points by looting anything on their alts and certain items are still "reserved" outside of EP/GP at all.
---
EP/GP sounded like such an awesome system, but I've never actually been a part of a guild where it wasn't horribly abused so I'm a bit bitter. :)
---
So extra virgin olive oil is extra m magic?
---
But also kinda ugly
---
It was in Cata, you're both wrong (:
---
Same here, people are paying 50s-2g for green and blue BOEs in the 10-20lvl range.
---
This is even better than I remember it being during vanilla so Im not complaining.
---
Could try Blackrock mobs in Burning Steppes.  High level, lots of them, some chests nearby, and I'm pretty sure they drop the mighty rage potion recipe.  Though I don't really go to that area so it may also be heavily farmed.
---
This post again?
---
If you read their responses, they dont sound like adults.
---
That is completely different. It's fine for the holy pladin to need on healer items when he's acting as the healer. Int is a high priority stat for holy paladins. And if it's stated at the outset, even better.
---
But agility is **the best stat** for hunters and rogues (ignoring weapon DPS). And for warriors, it's fine. It's a nice to have.
---
If the drop had been a one handed strengh and stamina sword, then most warriors would have expected to get it and been  annoyed if the rogue rolled need. It's about being considerate of the other people around you.
---
mapster can do what you are looking for
---
Well yeah anything goes for that because it is subjective, but I‚Äôm giving benefit of the doubt, saying this guy probably was horrible for someone to warrant a response like that from a guild.  I feel guild members don‚Äôt go out the way to say you were bad for doing too much healing.... That‚Äôs reaching and why I said within reason. Just like the law is beyond a reasonable doubt. Reasonable can be measured if you take a large enough sample size and average their thoughts.. of course maybe a drug addict thinks it‚Äôs reasonable to do 2k worth of drugs daily. But on average people would say that is not within ‚Äúreason‚Äù
---
Makes an analogy of women crying rape and uses the word "SJW" in one post. I can already tell what kind of person that poster is and just kinda cements the fact that this is not the kind of guild anyone should want to be part of.
---
When theres 20 dead beast but none have been looted....
---
Because we want to reward people who show up every time versus the ones who dont? Everyone has a chance still. Its not dkp where you have very little chance, you still have a decent chance.
---
Druids have the best ST threat in the game, and it's not particularly close
---
Had the same question
---
Except it actually does?
---
Is there a mod with dungeon maps?  I understand the client may not support showing your position but it would be nice to have a map in game.
---
No the quest reward comes with 150 riding. Also you cant get it till phase 2
---
My guy, I‚Äôve seen locks refusing to drink when we have a mage in the group giving free water. and if they‚Äôre eating that‚Äôs great. You have no idea how man just stand there and life tap themselves to near death and then just stand there before the next pull.
---
Yep, Whipemane is pathetic, cant even raid stormwind
---
Youd be surprised, I still remember the guy's name who ninja tagged a kill when my group had been waiting for 10 minutes for the quest mob spawn. I will not be groping with him at 60 due to his poor behavior. That shit does follow you around again.
---
I maintain threat by singling out a target and by pulling properly and generating threat by sundering/revenge on other mobs when its up. Taunt any targets that lose aggro
---
Do you think they fare any better in pvp? That's really the reason for me to gear up.
---
Especially with the BIS agi cape that dropped of hard mode of the airship fight (iirc it was the airship fight)
---
we all know its a high chair he needs
---
I literally don‚Äôt know how you manage that; every attempt I‚Äôve had to sell BOEs (even blues!) on the AH has been met with a wasted deposit.
---
They left it so that they didn't have to spend any of their incredible wealth on some minimum wage customer service people.
---
It was originally going to be for all lot, until people complained enough until they decided to only leave it on raid loot.
---
You don‚Äôt even have to undercut the buyout price! Match the buyout, undercut the bid, and yours shows up first.
---
I'm surprised by you choosing dodge instead of increased gouge. Isn't the increased gouge time hugely useful since it allows you to re-stealth?
---
The most valuable thing is heavy cooldown stuff, and there are plenty of people gearing up for raids, so the crafting stuff is actually at a pretty high demand rate right now. I am at 39 and had 30G saved up for my mount. I did some calculations and dumped the 30G into cloth and mats to get my tailoring to 250, and now every 4 days I have a nice free 20G (plus whatever low price I get for DE mats), well before I can actually use the mooncloth.
---
Haha that literally happened to me yesterday, I was so fuming. Try not be like those fucks, you sound decent. But if you have to, good luck with your rolls.
---
id say the porky font on MSBT is worse lol :P
---
I have the same desk mat.
---
Wouldn't have it any other way. The game would not be nearly as interesting if these players didn't exist.
---
So far it's having a positive influence on my life, thank you :)
---
I'll check it out, sounds perfect with the sizing chart, should at least give me some idea of the chair I'm looking for!
---
I'll take your word for it! (it was only missing a "buy now" link or wouldn't have believed you haha)
---
Thank you.
---
Ya just referring to my race mount, I know I cant get the dreadsteed till p2
---
When you killed them did you gt a line about reputation change? Is Syndicate the rogue rep that is opposite of Ravenholdt? Been a long time since I leveled a Rogue and I'm too lazy to go look up the details myself.
---
Herod has a Hunter shortage.
---
Many people rolled Hunters, got a few levels, then heard they were shit in Naxx and went Mage or Warlock.
---
They aren't bad, just that the gear in Naxx is better for Warlocks and Mages get to be Fire, which means rolling Ignites.
---
"But shaman's can't tank" they cried... as I am not apparently going to be tanking Princess today. 
---
There's a joke among my guildies that at this rate somehow I am going to be offtanking molten core as a shaman and 1: that is impossible and 2: I wish I rolled druid/warrior help.
---
As if the random pug hasn‚Äôt done it a thousand times too in their life. Or some other dungeon. Everyone thinks they put in more work and deserves it more than the next person. They are rarely right. Just grow up and roll on it. Pugs aren‚Äôt second class citizens and you shouldn‚Äôt treat them with less respect than guiltiest.
---
Use hots before you go bear. Go bear and then engage. When theres 3 seconds left on it faerie fireand charge in.
---
Tab swipe on mobs.
---
Be the best aoE tank your healers and spell cleave group ever had.
---
Seriously. I have way more issue holding threat even on multiple mobs on my warrior than on my druid.
---
Tab swipe when you have a healthy amount of rage is amazing.
---
It fixes the issue with maul; which is that it's a very slow attack based on autos like heroic strike.
---
Maul the skull then start tab swiping!
---
You could keep an alt that does herbalism , but alchemy is going to be too expensive without a cheap source of herbs.
---
So is this zoomer humor
---
They "hate" you in the same way they "hate" huntards. They might not actually hate you, but they're going to pick on you because the dumbest among you can be really obnoxious in dungeons. I don't think anyone actually hates ALL mages.
---
Get the druid 10 more levels
---
Love the comparison to a woman who gets raped but it‚Äôs her fault. This dude is poison.
---
I sure can, just stop being a whiny little baby
---
Have you tried restarting...?
---
Yaaaaaaawn. And yet, you make *another* fuckin post about it.
---
You should collect enhance gear and then gear with int/spirit/+healing power. You can have 2 sets of gear, even if it‚Äôs all cloth.
---
You don‚Äôt REALLY need to go into the resto tree honestly
---
Tough question, ask your class officer what the plan is, they may assign you something.
---
If you can remain out of combat while they pull you can cast a big heal and as it goes off smash your water to drink. You‚Äôll drink before being put in combat from the heal. Used that on occasion on my pally.

No, google it
---
A huge amount of Druid's BiS also doesn't come from raids so it's much easier to farm.
---
Additionally, you can obtain your forever-BiS (as in through Naxx) weapons and trinkets before ever stepping foot into a raid. And I believe the Ony neck is BiS for quite a while as well.
---
&gt; And if they're not using crowd pummelers their threat is crap.
---
Everything else you said is funny, but man that line just shows your absolute ignorance of the subject.
---
I'm glad you said that. I was like.. your trying to defend yourself.. starting with a rape analogy?
---
And they threw in SJWs? Like, were talking about loot here what on earth is this dude talking about.
---
Uh, 99% of groups with a reserve will post it in their LFM message ahead of time. You said nothing like
---
&gt;I never have understood the ‚Äúreserved‚Äù line of thinking over the years where specifically I am talking about groups that don't mention it.
---
Even this group, he told them before they went in the dungeon, the OP is just pissed because he didn't say it before filling out the raid.
---
Not inviting certain classes because you want an item screws over people who just need quests and people who already have that item and are targeting something else. Reserving an item screws over nobody. In reserved groups, people decide if it's worth it for themselves to go along with the condition. In your groups, you decide for them based on nothing except their class.
---
10x more douchy.
---
Your passive gold income increases quite a bit as you level, so you should be fine.  Be stingy about what skills you train, the worst that can happen is you have leftover gold at 40 to catch up on training.
---
If you have too many options, you should see a warlock's spell book.
---
For the most part, you dont need things like sunder armor in battle stance, even tho you can use it. Some abilities that aren't tied to a stance are tied to a type of play.
---
Set up your defensive stance for tanking, etc..
---
Yep.
---
Only small-brainers undercut by 1 copper.
---
I did read your post in its entirety, and with all the people quitting, vitriol, and impatience that is unfortunately commonplace in pugs, I couldn't agree more that the best thing about the run was that people were level headed and enjoyed themselves. Stuff like that makes MMOs great.  I apparently offended a bunch of people due to my choice of words, and I can own that.
---
Good luck on your adventures, continue to have fun.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people are so obsessed with preraid bis. It‚Äôs not like MC or Onixya‚Äôs lair is unclearable without it. Hell, I guarantee that if you‚Äôre ‚Äúsomewhat‚Äù decent at the game, you can complete both raids with fresh 60s with half there gear being quest greens.
---
I have also heard it was patched but can't verify
---
Interesting take.  Keep doing you.
---
Fishing on Herod is great, only at lvl25 and I‚Äôm halfway to my mount lol
---
Yeah I'm sick of seeing all the post about how "spell cleave ruined classic wow".
---
Its the stupidest shit ever.
---
.... yes bro. lol
---
Thats true for a bit. What it means later is that there's TONS of money to buy low level stuff.
---
Good idea. I‚Äôm sure this post getting traction will help this situation and further potential ones.  Sad that public humiliation is what it takes.  Even sadder that it doesn‚Äôt do a thing to others.
---
Litterally havent rolled need in a single item yet, but if im gunna have the rep may aswell play the part.
---
Hey, you're not the only one.. literally 0 of my irl friends know about or play.. yet i'm hooked. Have some acquaintances i play with from past guilds but def feel solo in the world. This game is about creating those connections though, take a chance join a guild, be outgoing it will likely pay out for you.
---
Lol what a loser
---
When is the census from? The addon hasn‚Äôt worked since they reopened transfers like 10 days ago
---
Just go to the makeover mage duh.
---
Does Leatrix maps work with Questie? Thanks!
---
Crafted items are going to be really dumb because literally everyone will be able to join a pug bwl and get better stuff.
---
All warlocks are destro in classic
---
On my server it‚Äôs starting to get busy. Most people are hitting 40 and finishing up stv and desolace and moving on.
---
Searing gorge has been the new pvp hotspot with all the lvl 55+ ganking questers.
---
My opinion on the whole BOE drop is that any player can exchange that piece of gear for an equivalent piece that they will benefit from. So everyone should need on the roll.
---
That's about where I was at at that level on my Warrior. Got his mount around 43. But I didn't have the advantage of pick pocketing. I just had the disadvantage of higher repair costs.
---
I've played retail wow pretty much every expansion and never paid any attention to the enter world button... when I turned on classic I felt like it was a new(old) button and i got super nostalgic. Saw later that the retail button is the same, it however doesn't even come close the feels I get when I press "enter world" on classic. The retail one should say "enter slot machine lounge" lol.
---
SUPRISE! YOU GET NO LOOT FOR YOUR EFFORTS. KTHNXBAI
---
Should be 60 by Monday mate. Don't think I will need dungeons to level. If every quest mob your after is dead, you should find some new quests. There's a lot that aren't as contested, and if they are just grind mobs and go back later.... The quests are basically just thinly veiled grinds that reward a little bit of XP anyway. I ran around killing raptors and shit in arathi for 2 levels in the mid 30s.
---
Its easy to regain threat and control with taunts, sunder, and revenge. If I have an aoe group I just let them cc and blizz, and war stomp and then pull back any targets with taunt or sunders.
---
In the pr-bc phase I remember a lot of joint naxx raids of two or more S tier guilds that were filled with known people from A and B tier guilds. So especially the first easier bosses can be done with a few undergeared people.
---
No, I think it‚Äôs a guild devoted to legal Statutes of Limitations.
---
This thread is the exact reason the rule exists. Canker offers almost no evidence or context. This isn't proof of anything. But people aren't going to actually pay attention or investigate, just make snap judgements.
---
She can torture me with her toots
---
by messaging your friends to come help lol.  Warlocks are just the scissors to our paper. very very hard to beat on an equal playing field.
---
my strat when a warlock comes after me is to run away and hide.
---
Yup! My priest
---
Find a BRD group and farm it. Either clearing the entrance + arena + jailer.. or a torch run (great xp but 0 gold/items, so that sucks).
---
If you're against dungeon grinding for &lt;reasons&gt; then respec back to shadow, it's not that expensive if you only do it 2-3 times.
---
Staying holy and not dungeon grinding feels like the strangest possible decision. Either dungeon grind, or respec back to Shadow 
---

Also thankful for your reply. I was wondering the same thing about a shield bash macro I'm using. I didn't notice that a weapon swap forces a gcd.

Yikes.
---
I'm guessing talking to a mage about polymorph?
---
The person you're arguing with is the one using the word legit. The other party only used the word "reputable."
---
That was likely to be in part because the private servers made errors in drop rates of vendor greys. We know they made a lot of guesses, they had to; unlike blizzard they didn't have access to an old legitimate server to work their numbers from.
---
Free month and an apology after canceling ticket. Nice :\]

It's goblin engineering.  Arrows that, when hit, stun (that cannot be removed by any means) then portal the target 300y directly in the air above Gadgetzan.

It's about sending a message.

Did I ask you something?

except those were in vannilla

Speak for yourself. I'm a new player and my friend (who played back in the day) has less time played and is 10 levels higher. Neither of us are speeding through it either lol

Lol at the redditors upvoting this because they couldn't fathom being part of an inner circle.
---
My rs clan used to lure recruits who we thought were bad for their items shits hilarious.

I'm 100% convinced that the elves are using it as toilet paper.

Fuck off fish police. Go back to guarding puddles please.

I seem to sell more stuff if I only post 1 or 2 stacks at a time. I think when I flood the market with my pots people assume I'm a bot who is manipulating the market and avoid my name.
---
if this where true then it would be doing it in other games i play such as osrs which requires many right clicks =p. Also if i hold right click in or right click drag on my desktop there is no issue. I dont suppose its worth mentioning my mouse is g5 series they are made to last and its still brand new. Its really not my mouse, i am considering disabling all my add ons to see if it has any effect.
---
Fureal
---
I would be ok with the neutral colour change but should still be attackable. Surely making anything not attackable is restrictive.
---
&gt; What's fucked is people's expectations.
---
this
---
no shit you are not selling twink items in week 2 for hundreds/thousands of gold
---
Where the hell are you buying runecloth at 1g a stack, pretty sure it vendors for more than that.
---
This is why social media can be so cancerous, and reddit is no different. One person sees people complaining and assumes everyone is complaining, then somehow their ego gets triggered and they feel the need to tell everyone off. It's a vicious cycle and you are part of it OP. Get outside more.
---
Just face it u guys suck at WoW bruh
---
Awww :(
---
This is 100% me parroting things I've heard, but IIRC, Regrowth is a huge waste of mana, and HT is the most Mana efficient of the druid heals.
---
&gt;Vanilla's class balance is based on every class having their own strengths and weaknesses.
---
Imagine unironically defending vanilla balance.
---
Vanilla's balance is about some classes and specs being total shit and others being amazing.
---
I made my first mount money selling deviate fish. To be fair though I found the recipe for savory delight
---
Regardless of if you reduce their xp from said mob, you are saving them time from a corpse run and thus allowing them more time to earn more xp.
---
1) Get a fish that cooks into a good stat buff, and sell the food, not the fish
---
2) Prioritize floating wreckages
---
Anti spellcleave circle jerk propaganda
---
I dunno man.  Maybe it's the server you're on?   I'm on Mirage Raceway EU horde side, which is a high pop server but horde is outnumbered by alliance quite considerably - much like my old vanilla server actually.   In my experience smaller factions tend to encourage more co-operation between players.
---
Good one!
---
Just go 21/25/5 ........ Its not quite as good as full shadow in terms of dps, but it gets the job done surprisingly well for solo, and it does its job in raid..... especially in P1 
---
You do miss out on 10% healing by not going 30 in holy.... But P1 is pretty easy and as long as you are semi decent you dont feel the 10% much.

This guy was a prolific ninja through every expansion he played. The guy has some issues irl but it doesn‚Äôt excuse his shitty behaviour. I was actually fond of him as a person back in the day and thought he had changed. Guess not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I would say you're not a ninja but to avoid conflict in the future might be a good idea to let group know if you're looking for specific gear off spec
---
yep, mr. Pro thrall killer vs no horde
---
I know a large handful of shamans around 55+ on Blaumeux because I'm a warrior who loves his WF totem and good heals.
---
I don't see any problem with Shamans getting groups because if anything they're the most flexible healer in the game, mana spring and WF totem are both needed in spell/melee cleave groups.
---
Druids are a dead class imo if you're not playing tank.
---
Hunters and rogues don't have a problem getting into groups either because they can join in a melee cleave easily and still put out large amounts of dps.
---
If people are stupid and exclude a good class or a decent player from their group they were stupid to begin with, its not because of spell cleave that their stupidity reined in.
---
Obviously, I know that I don't have a dedicated helper. My point is that I can't understand how they can manage to be overwhelmed at all times when the average user requires such little support.
---
Yeah I never pass up an opportunity to gank a gnome when I see one.
---
Do I need the required zone for where the wreckage is in to fish it successfully?
---
You can't prevent people from leaving a server but maybe, if a server is highly unbalanced, they could disallow the creation of new chars on the predominant faction unless you already have one.
---
That would prevent both people from switching faction and new people from making it worse, until the server is decently balanced again.
---
Whenever something annoys me I make some other random persons night hell. Awesome.
---
This picture is of an alliance pvping horde though?
---
I was more just pointing out that it's a weird sound for an outsider to hear. I want it disabled because every lock seems to think it's fun to spam "mmmmm "whip* ahh!" and I find it to be irritating.
---
Really? Hm, maybe I've been doing it all wrong then... HT just feels like it takes so long to channel and put out. Should I not be using regrowth then? Maybe that's why I've been having mana issues with higher leveled situations haha
---
I‚Äôm enjoying buying all of the Lynx boots for 7-11g

Run &gt; MSCONFIG &gt; Services &gt; Check Hide all Microsoft services &gt; Deselect anything left &gt; Click the Start up Tab and get to your startup items &gt; Unselect everything &gt; Restart
---
If it still says there's a game running then download Revo Uninstalled, run it in advanced mode and delete everything it finds (this may also delete other Blizzard games, be warned)  Download Pirifim CCleaner, run it several times until it comes back mostly clean.  Restart.  Run Ccleaner once more Ensure the program is indeed gone from program list. Reinstall.
---
Nice!!
---
Yeah, and he was talking about the server anyway... Turns out I'm a fuckin doofus, but I'll own it and not delete the comment
---
Tanks are more in demand than healers so you have to deal with them
---
Don't let these monsters make you explain yourself. If you don't keep your pet green and smiley you have no business sending it in to fight for you.
---
The best approach is to start every group announcing what you're after if it's not normally gear that the role you're performing would want. Simple rookie mistake, only an asshole move if you do it again now that you know better.
---
The only way to fix imbalances like that is to merge 2 lopsided servers together but this wont happen at the moment due to the high volumes of players , that will just create log in queues
---
Good point. I‚Äôll get more red bull.
---
That's a narrow point of view. I only play pvp servers and I often help horde I find. And if they attack me in return, I'm gonna ruin their whole day. There are many ways to enjoy pvp servers.
---
I would agree that crying about getting ganked is dumb, because that's what you signed up for.
---
You are failing to grasp [basic economics](https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/e7/9b/hero_e79bb95f-4b23-4b19-aac9-0529e944814c.png)... 
---
No item has an inherent "value" aside from the price floor created by the vendor. The AH value of an item is the market price (P). The price is variable because it is a function of quantity supplied (Q) on the AH. When the quantity is low (QL), the price is high (PH). When the quantity is high (QH), the price is low (PL).
---
In other words, that item is ONLY valued at a market price of 40g when there is one on the market. When there are two on the market, the value is lower. Why? Because few people are going to pay 40g for it. But more people will pay 30g for it.
---
&gt; If an item is valued at 40g but someone posts it for 30g to potentially get rid of it faster but another person undercuts them to 29g, we've lost more than a quarter of the items value.
---
Nope. If 1 item sells for 40g, that is 40g in sales. If 2 items sell for 30g, that is 60g in sales. 60g is better than 40g.
---
Undercutting the competition to gain sales in a competitive market is good business practice. Trying to maintain artificially high prices in a market with excessive supply is a fool's game. The only way that works is if players collude to restrict the supply (by not posting items). However, there are too many people selling items for this to work.
---
Yup, gotta say something in advance
---
Why am I seeing alot of people keep auto attack on their action bar? Am I missing something specific to classic or are people keeping it there for nostalgia?
---
Your rank 4 healing touch is your main spam heal. Don't use regrowth unless you need the quick heal. I keep rejuvenation on tanks at all time. I use rejuvenation on dps when I'm to lazy to top them up with rank 4 healing touch.
---

---
If that doesn't work try disabling some of your addons.
---
Then perhaps we try the phrase "an important part of the game *to me*"?
---
The tendency to make sweeping statements of fact that are actually preference is irksome.
---
He never said it was deleted therefore it didn't exist. It was deleted so it went into a "non active" pile of tickets as opposed to "pending / active".
---
The fact that this "non active" ticket was found, handled, and game time credited pretty much indicates blizz saw his post on Reddit and did some digging.
---
&gt;I have wondered about the same thing for years - I mean, as a paladin I never really understood why we (as alliance) have to fight the Scarlet Crusade to begin with?
---
In addition to being fanatics who hate anyone not wearing their uniform, their leader is intentionally pushing them in a "kill everyone" direction. I don't want to spoil why if you don't already know.
---
If it were whipemane we wouldn‚Äôt have had to mop the floor with horde, you guys would have been busy ghost running through blackrock mountain

That Druid you killed in the beginning Aaronvee is my guildie lol

Yeah because ignorance is still a thing and not everyone‚Äôs on reddit. Still the people on his realm who saw this post most likely won‚Äôt. 
---
See a little common sense and situational thinking with the context provided goes a long way
---
Do you have a link to a complete list that provides the info?
---
That's going to be a yikes from me
---
auctioneer does IIRC, not sure about TSM
---
Skeram alliance here, I don't even want to finish levelling my paladin because I'm not sure how many decent alliance guilds will be left. Also I've quested almost exclusively through dungeons as a result.
---
Probably gonna head on over to deviate delight or something.
---
Anyone know of an addon that would tell you when extra swing (from sword specs) proc?
---
And the data wasn't even very accurate before that. People are putting way too much faith in those census sites.
---
Time to quit that guild bro
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a PvP server people are free to do that if they like, what‚Äôs the issue? 
---
Did you read the last part? I got killed lol.
---
The AH market is almost entirely made up of drops from instanced dungeons. Layering doesn‚Äôt effect that.
---
Yes, this is also true
---
Get yourself a Razer Naga mouse or similar.... It has 12 buttons on the side you can hit with your thumb.  That simply paired with ALT or CTRL gives you 36 buttons to hit.  Granted it's still difficult to juggle them all but that helps a bit.
---
For Warrior specific your main button bar should be shifting for each stance also so I try to keep only buttons on the main bar that can be used for that stance (i.e. I don't put Berserker Rage on my main bar for Battle Stance).  There are exceptions of course for stance dancing where you probably want to have your Overpower Macro (Battle Stance -&gt; Overpower -&gt; Berserker Stance) on your main button bar for Berserker Stance.
---
I'd recommend going out and looking a few Warrior Macro pages to give you some idea as well.  There are ways to combine a couple things that you always use together to save some button space.  Also grab Bartender or something like that to help you organize them in a way that works for you.
---
All things considered, yes. I wouldn't say dirt cheap but for how valuable they are that's fairly inexpensive.
---
You should check out the auctioneet addon. Scan the auction house once a day and it will gather data on how items are being priced for sale on your server on average
---
Yeah, I mean sports in general can explain that. What do you do with all that warrior energy? Dump it into sports or even games.
---
I disagree with this I play a male Druid just to be a giant lovable cow it‚Äôs all ways funny when I get invites to dungeons because people assume I‚Äôll tank or dps but in reality I‚Äôm just a big pacifist healer
---
If you want to tank while leveling (and still quest at a decent speed) i suggest doing the following:
---
For talents - 
---
Level as arms until ~40 then switch to DW fury when you get your Vengeance 1h sword and Sword of Serenity for DW, eventually at ~48 youll get Thrash blade which replaces serenity and will be your main hand. 
---
For Proffs -
---
100% get engineering if you have the extra funds try to get 250 for dense dynamite. This is going to be your AoE threat ability, depending on how often you use it, you‚Äôll use around 20 per dungeon.  As for blacksmithing, this isn‚Äôt incredibly worth it unless you are your guilds Dedicated BS otherwise just get minning to help support eng or just get skinning for the extra cash.
---
Between these two things leveling will be fairly easy and dungeon tanking is a joke
---
lol with LoH up too.
---
Oh no you read my profile! Doesn't change how you're being a whiny little bitch just because you're dog shit at the game lol
---
And if your tanks are multiple different classes, you can have the offtank take the boss during the MT's  class call.
---
Alright, thank you, this is good to know. Right now I have my spell bar set up so I have my most current rank/one down ranked version of HT/regrowth/rejuv, should I just keep one regrowth on my spellbar? I'll have to get in the mindset of using HT more often.
---
D O M I N A N C E  A S S E R T E D
---
Its probably just easier to have a default setting and then change them if its important, rather than manually setting the gender for each mob
---
I have a few and they're always worth the extra money.
---
Lol, yeah after I wrote the first paragraph I considered asking them for compensation. Naturally I had to add the disclaimer.
---
Regardless best investment I‚Äôve made recently and I am very frugal and critical of paying for a brand name instead of a product.
---
Cheers
---
Healer's fault for not letting DPS die in this situation.
---
No they don‚Äôt
---
u want PvP u got PvP.
---
I love this classic chaos that breaks out of seemingly nothing at all.
---
About 2 days ago, I was doing the murloc quest in Hillsbrad with 2 friends. When all of a sudden one of us thought the nearby alliance were going to gank him so he charges in.... They shredded us as they were about 4-6 lvl above us and then of course once "we started" they just waited for us to return to that post. This kept going for about minutes until we finally think "well screw this..." quickly Chat with our guild and within 5 minutes multiple lvl 40-max guys from our guild show up, it's a amassacre. 5 more minutes and a group of more alliance shows up. All out war for about half an hour! It was great!
---
It's got a lot of depth and weird situational stuff. If you're sharp you can 2v1 people that aren't undead regularly.
---
In 5mans you do a lot of cool stuff
---
In raids u put up a curse and literally press shadowbolt and that's it
---
Bear druids are actually threat kings. (so long as they farm crowd pummelers from Gnomer)
---
&gt; Ive read about skeram alliance transferring by the guild because of hardcore pvp guilds ganking the shit out of them.
---
Also known as, how to accidently transfer without moving servers to a PVE server.
---
What bar addon?
---
It's not weird. It's beyond insanely good and BIS for Rogues, Fury Wars, Ret Paladins.
---
Had a pair drop in successive runs yesterday
---
I'm more concerned about how the hell I'm going to make gold at level 60. Most other classes are highly efficient farmers, but a Priest is not (especially without Shadow form). I look forward to healing end game content, but out in the world doing quests or farming...I'm going to be useless.
---
Agree about ret. But enh can still be decent. It takes more effort and a pure class putting in equal effort will out perform them, BUT I'd rather have an enh that puts in the effort than someone that just follows the meta and does the minimum.
---
Its like the difference between a good rogue and an excellent one. Put them in equal gear and you can still tell the difference. I'd take an excellent enh over a good rogue anyday. Plus you gotta account for the boost the sham gives the melee in his group.
---
I feel bad when the healer drops a massive heal on me. Renew is plenty. Between cannibalize and first aid, I'm solid.
---
Rolling need on mana consumables is very different from needing on stuff for your profession.
---
Or maybe its incredibly hard to tell how many players are going to show up, and stay for that matter.
---
I'm not saying they didn't goof, but could you have done any better?
---
Whitemane almost all herbs are just above vendor price, and all created potions sell for huge loss in profit, up to 275. I think there are some potiosn that the recipie is a drop for that might have some good profits. I dont have em yet.
---
Point to the place where the bad man hurt you.
---
&gt;OP is a joke if he can't even do that in 2019.
---
Not only did he not provide proof the the size of his screen grab shows hes trying to hide other information from the public in order to name and shame players.
---
If he was the ONLY pug in an 18 man raid(not 40) then its obvious the guild probably had loot reserved. Otherwise why wouldn't they do it with 40 people?
---
&gt; So if you want to make your own group, you have to basically wait until the other group fills before you get shots at dps and tanks. 
---
That's not true. This is not a first come first serve thing. If reserved items are really such a big deal for so many people, you'll have your group (without reserved items) filled up much faster. And if your group filled up and is only missing a tank, while another group (with reserved items) is still missing a tank and 2 dps, where do you think a tank will join first?
---
I leveled as a 2H Arms warrior who ran tank in dungeons.
---
I consider tanking to be my "main" role. My leveling 2h would be considered my "off-spec" in this case.
---
Main roll item drops and is an upgrade for you? Need. Always and forever unless you joined a reserved group and honestly I **never **ever join reserve groups** as a tank unless they are 40-mans.
---
Off-Spec? Ask your group first if it's okay to roll need for your leveling DPS spec. If they say no, then just greed.
---
Going to vendor or sell the item on the AH? Greed.
---
Ya man you're totally right, I guess I haven't consistently saved lives over the years.
---
I wonder if (and I preface this saying I don't understand fully how the layering system works) if they could make everything outside of cities layered, but not cities. That way, you take care of the issue of resource scarcity, while still making everyone feel connected. I assume, though, this would not be possible.
---
...yes but since it's phase 1 you have no choice if you're trying to get pre-raid bis.
---
Needing epics is a simple, trustless system.
---
I mean technically you can get it but you‚Äôll be too busy healing to keep it up...
---
Master want weed because Gordo bad boy.
---
I enjoyed tri-spec the most, silence+mindflay, some holy some disc
---
Let them die while you sit out of combat.
---
I pull that shit all the time.  Bad warrior tanks always charge in when I'm on like 10% mana drinking even after I say "wait mana" in chat.
---
Its not my repair bill.  If need be I'm able to slap on the rest of my ele gear and tank the dungeon myself.
---
With the opportunity cost of time invested plus deposit plus AH cut when you might have to list an item several times... those basically nullify the potential sales price of any green right now when compared to EZ vendor guaranteed cash. IMO
---
Needing on offspec is fine as long as you're clear about it. But you then don't get to need on leather dps/tank gear.
---
39* You can actually use certain mounts at lvl 1 now.
---
I'm a lv 50 BM Hunter, in instances my pet does about 35-40% ofnmy damage
---
**Nuanced take**: the role that you lock into at the beginning of the dungeon is the loot table that you are expected to stay within. So, as a druid tank, it is expected that you'll only roll on feral gear. This means that a rogue in your group cannot be surprised if you roll on *anything* that they might also need. **However**, this also means that you should not roll on off-spec gear *unless* you clearly communicate this at the beginning of the dungeon. "Hey guys, I know I'm tanking, but I'm only coming along because I need the Illusionary Rod." Even if someone has some objections, they can always drop and join another group.
---
**Quick take**: you're kind of the ass hole, but it's really not that big of a deal. The staff has a very good drop chance, so they can always run it again. It's not like we're talking about the [Savage Gladiator Chain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11726), [Dragon's Call](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10847), or [Headmaster's Charge](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13937).
---
In OG Vanilla:
---
As a rogue, I lost the roll on Dragon's Call to a hunter. As a warlock, I lost the roll on Headmaster's Charge to a holy priest.
---
Shhh, don't tell people.
---
Pigging back off this stellar response for bears:
---
1-2). GROWL = Taunt.  Lasts 3 seconds, 10 second CD and no talent reduction. 
---
Challenging Roar = Challenging Shout in every way.
---
That‚Äôs it. 
---
3) Same. Very situational but one thing I‚Äôd like to mention is the importance of using Growl/Taunt to effectively give you free threat.  I will sometimes ‚Äòignore‚Äô a mob until a DPS gains aggro then I will lay down a Maul and Swipe to push myself ahead on threat. Again, very situational and I would describe best as a dance. 
---
4) ‚Äî‚Äî
---
5) For bears threat generation, we have Maul, Swipe, Faerie Fire Feral (FF), and Demoralizing Roar.  
---
Maul is the primary ability and will be used as much as possible, cycling through mobs to maintain their above healers and DPS cleaves then Swiping (up to 3 targets) as a rage dump.  FF is free and grants a little threat and decent rebuff.  Demo Roar give a little AoE threat and helps mitigation. 
---
Maul &gt; Swipe; get Demo Roar up; FF on CD
---
One sweet hack as a Druid is heals. Start your pull with a Rejuvenation on you and your life tapping Warlock friend to provides oodles of threat early on. 
---
Another great but non-threat generating but important ability is Feral Charge. It has an 8-25 yard range, provides great mobility, interrupts, and adds a crucial immobilize for those range aggro‚Äôd mobs and is long enough to give you time to attack and/or taunt to regain aggro. Doesn‚Äôt help much if people stand right next to the stuck mob though.
---
6.1-6.2) I am always changing targets. An improved nameplates adding like ThreatPlates help know who is attacking you and who just switched to a melee or ranged. 
---
In general, if the dungeon is easy, AoE away. In more difficult situations, best not to got nuts unless you want to get smacked by hard hitting guys. 
---
7) Again, if we‚Äôre going all out and it‚Äôs not too tough of an instance no biggie but AoE away then running around like an idiot is not helpful (locks, hunters, and mages see to enjoy this). 
---
8) As a warrior DPSing, killing the highest DPS and lower armor mobs should be the focus. Let the hard hitting, high armor melee stay on tank and feel free to go nuts on a guy with a staff. Warriors, shammies, and rogues can stand usually a few hits in dungeons but I‚Äôm well aware of the health ticks from their tanking. 
---
9) when they attack healer, hell naw. Need to help ASAP.  It‚Äôs nice when other DPS recognize this and will do what they can to pull off or stun the mob (hamstring can help too). Sometimes I‚Äôm not paying enough attention in PuGs on tough pull and something strays to them or a ranged mob is shooting at them. Communication is key and if your healer dies then things will get significantly harder.  Not to mention the downtime from rezzing/running back. 
---
Situational when it‚Äôs a DPS. Hunter, good ones can FD, kite, or trap. Clothies will need help. Good mages nova and locks will fear, if safe.  Melee should use stun/slow or DPS harder to get it down. 
---
Really, learning when to go all on a guy and when to avoid damage is something you should take heed of in your experiences. Don‚Äôt be an a-hole, we are all on the same team. 
---
10) Favorite dungeon: In Classic, UD Strat is great and the 45 min run adds an extra element of thrill.
---
55, can vouch that wand is still BFF
---
That guy is living in the future
---
Fucking hell you're still going on about this.
---
Literally the Karen of classic wow.
---
Yes do it. There's nothing better to put it in rly. 
---
I think 3 points takes u to 25 in Affliction.
---
U can also use it on pve mobs
---
I like the idea of "alchemy kits", selling groups of herbs that "should be enough" to max out low level alchemists. Beyond that, if you aren't getting more than vendor + fee, then it's not worth auctioning. I'd say that 2x is a decent low point, but make sure you're on an upward trend before you post (e.g., look for undercut auctions ending soon).
---
Fucking Christ you just made me laugh really loud in an airport terminal and I got some dirty looks
---
I assume you mean the show on Netflix, right? Is it really that good? I started watching it but I couldn‚Äôt get passed the weird sound of the English dub. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right to me for some reason. The story actually seemed like it‚Äôd be really good though.
---
Its funny how instead of actually talking about the topic you're trying to psychoanalyze someone online...
---
I was also 15 in 2006 and attempting to raid. I also had issues where guild leaders would mislead me over loot systems. I believe you being a kid meant that they thought they could bully you into taking less loot. That's certainly how I feel about my experience in retrospect. 
---
If they were dumb enough to not master loot a raid boss and ignored your attempts at communication, it's their own damn fault.
---
You get XP for each faction.
---
First of all, your old guild didn't know what they were doing since the only way to become uncrushable is with shield block - defense doesn't do anything about crushes, only crits (not that becoming uncrittable is important for warriors anyway since you sacrifice too much threat).
---
Second, crushing blows don't do anything other than 150% of normal damage. That's a joke to a druid, with full consumes a druid will survive 2 crits in a row, so only frenzy/enrage bosses actually put a druid in danger of dying as a raid tank.
---
30 seconds just checked.
---
I could go into the concept of odds and how 2 outcomes doesn't mean they're equally likely... but somehow I don't think that's the point.
---
Yeah if that chain of events is true he dosn't know to hold agro
---
mana shield blocks 1 damage at the cost of 2 mana. You will go OOM very quickly if you use manashield in PVP
---
My girlfriend is a female night elf druid that helps horde. I'm the male night elf hunter that does /lol as they die by 3 mobs
---
Maybe I‚Äôm out of touch or super lucky, I‚Äôll blow up a lock 6 levels higher than me sword specc‚Äôd
---
Mind numbing and crippling poison, cheap shot, save 25 energy for kick, should have 4 point kidney - use a thistle tea if you have to, no way they‚Äôre hanging out after the kidney. Eat food to fight dots when they‚Äôre dead. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
PS: Don‚Äôt hypothetically duel me on Reddit please, I‚Äôm just sharing what I do.
---
It was on a list of known and fixed bugs for classic.
---
I rarely die and have yet to be anything but top dps in any dungeon I do with my current spec. Also have more survivability in the wild as I can sacrifice vw for a nice shield. I am the preteen but you are the one slinging insults over a preferred talent build in a video game lolll
---
The general strategy is to put dots on both targets and fear one of them while you focus on killing the other. The low dmg from your dot instances pretty much never breaks fear. If the feared targets starta heading into more mobs and might get them pulled, you can use Curse of Recklessness to break the fear. Also remember about healthstones. 
---
In general, drain tanking will get much more powerful once you get to lvl 30, with Drain Life upgraded and more talent points invested into it. At that point you will have a much easier time against 2-3 opponents. Then, another big jump will be at 40 when you will have learned Siphon Life and Dark Pact.
---
I want ace of the deep woods I like the look of it. I already have a fiery axe squirreled away and we all know ironfoe is a myth.
---
I personally enjoy Holy. I think each person should play their own way though that's bullshit. Find a guild who embraces you and your shadows.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a lot, those things hurt.
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Is it really 2 hours? Everything I‚Äôve seen says 7-8 hours
---
I lost it at the Hunter auto attack sounds like Bloons darts.
---
People banding back and forth here but let me tell you the reality.
---
In a guild group or group of friends, mention it first.
---
In this pug free for all at SM, not even a long dungeon and a commonly dropped item, don‚Äôt even skip a beat worrying about it 
---
You did nothing wrong, you need the item and will never see them again. Don‚Äôt lose sleep over it
---
If you want to evaluate Efficiency then use the formula amount healed / mana spent. This gives you a way of judging spells in relation to the resource cost. Generally speaking, your longest cast heals in classic will be the most ‚Äúefficient‚Äù (healing touch for druids) and the faster cast (regrowth) will be less so. The idea is that you are trading resource efficiency for speed. 
---
To maximize regeneration of mana with the 5 second rule, in dungeons wait till the tank goes down. By 30-40% then hit him with healing touch, and try to get back in the mana regen window. Cluster your casts then stop casting if you can so you can regen mana. 
---
The reason to downrank healing touch is to use the more efficient heal with less potential over-healing. You are doing well to keep the top rank and a down ranked version on your bar, try to stick to casting the downrank one until you need BIG heals then use the full rank one.
---
If you're trying to go from 48 to 60 during phase 2 it's going to be extremely hard,  there will be roving 5 mans of 60's in every zone, avidly avoiding pvp with other 60's so they can kill lvl 48+ questers for that easy honor. 
---
This is what happened on private servers at least so I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen here as well.  Some people will get fed up with the ganking and just give up on the game.
---
Or play on a PvE realm if PvP bothers you... Just saying...
---
No thanks. I'd rather not go back to my last relationship right now.
---
4s is what I pay for medium hides, medium leather is fairly easy to get for 15-17s a stack, so the vendor margin ends up being about 3-4s each craft. I find that it's worth the time, since I can queue up a big batch to craft 40 at a time and AFK for 10 minutes. Certainly there's more opportunity for G/hr out farming in the wild, but for making money AFK farming the auction house while I do other things it really isn't bad. 
---
Heavy leather is tougher to make a decent margin on buying from the AH, so I don't do that, I only buy heavy hides to balance out the ratio of leather/hides that I collect myself. Sometimes hides can be bought for 5s each, which is well worth it.
---
Thick leather gets a decent margin at the 1g20s mark, but this one is just the most time consuming and requires a lot of money put into it before you can see decent returns. If you can queue up 10 stacks and then go AFK for 20 minutes, that's +2.5 gold for basically no effort.
---
Arms warriors sunder in battle a lot actually
---
I'm glad warlocks accept that as they life tap to 5% health and occasionally pull aggro.
---
I'll still slap a heal on you just to keep your dps moving and the dungeon cleared faster -- but man I wish mages running head first into a pack and start trying to aoe would accept that they're retarded when they pull aggro and get killed in less than a second.
---
Vampiric embrace healing ftw!
---
I've been telling everyone to sit on all twink loot but no one listens.
---
Bank everything and have enough gold for your alts mounts and skills.
---
Not in this game? The humans don't really migrate to places. Elves and killing trolls is probably the other obvious example.
---
I get the joke, but the picture used makes this a little tasteless. There are plenty of photos that represent missing something, using someone mourning a friend who died, thats a bit much.
---
Who cares report it and move on with life. Are you really fishing for pats on the back.
---
just hit 60 and farm properly if you want to make gold. don‚Äôt waste your time with inefficient farming pre 60.
---
I see it mainly as a swap item for buffing
---
Holy hell.... I remember using Shadowpanther's gear list back in the day on my rogue...
---
Dumpster that guild man.
---
Inplay ally on skeram and may I just say you're a pussy.
---
this makes me think of "thog dont caare"
---
So basically need for everything cause people will steal it anyway. Nice community you got there classic. 
---
I get that there are scumbags but Im not gonna be one of them, if theres someone in the group who will actually gonna use that item Im not needig for it cause I need money. 
---
You do you man
---
Used Powerpoint
---
Earthfury isn't dead whatsoever. Has a nice balance &amp; constantly see both horde &amp; ally while questing.
---
Mental gymnastics can't save you being bad at math...
---
And when you get invited for meeting or party you have to change layer Genious!
---
I don't know the fight. Was a lock tanking because the damage recieved wasn't physical?
---
Are there are any raid viable tank specs that also work well in PvP?
---
Reddit having this much influence over the game scares me. All it takes is one asshole who has it out for you to lie and now there are a million people convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're invalid.
---
servers transfer have no effect on this.  all it does it let people salvage their progress instead of abandon it.  the big pvp servers will eventually reach illidan status with 99% horde because that's just how it works.  balanced w-pvp is a meme in reality
---
Hit 49 last night, currently able to drain tank 3-4 mobs of similar level, OR go on a never ending farm spree. +Shadow damage scales incredibly in your 40s, to such a point that Drain Life has actually become one of my highest DPS abilities. Using all +Shadow damage gear that I can get my hands on, with the other pieces being 'of Stamina' to make up for the HP lost.
---
Dark Pact makes all the difference, I just wish it was % based so I didn't have to hear that sound effect 6 times.
---
Someone was trying to sell crusader enchant for 800g on my server last night lel
---
Shit like this inspires me to kill every Alliance I come across üòÇ
---
&gt;Why do I read this with trolls accent, m~~a~~on?
---
Yes, same thing for any group, not just raids.
---
Hilarious that they thought you'd MT that group with those reserves lol!
---
Immersion
---
This is terrible advice for leveling, down ranking is not going to be efficient until well into 50's, with a near bis gear set.
---
addon!
---
That's good info! I'm 39 right now. Were you questing or just grinding nonstop? The problem I've run into is mobs aggroing myself or the succubus by proximity but that might be because of my camp choices. I also feel like I'm starting to get a bit burnt out grinding.
---
No it isn't. Server pop will directly affect the effectiveness of a black list. If it doesn't work on a 10k pop it won't work on servers with 30k+ populations.
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, I‚Äôve been playing since vanilla and this exact thing happened to me on the same quest ahah.
---
On the contrary, it's great at everything if you play it right. Just play what you like best and practice until you become so good at it that no one will be able to tell you your spec isn't good.
---
Druid sets (especially the first ones) are clearly aimed towards Resto, but that's irrelevant, really. I mean, most Druids will be Resto at endgame, but if you enjoy Bear or Cat or Boomkin better, don't let anyone ruin your fun, but instead find a way to make it work and prove your worth.
---
How tf did you get awarded a month of game time over a warning?  I argued with several tiers of customer support when the DDoS happened a few weeks ago, and they wouldn't even spare me an hour.  Also I haven't seen any of the support staff actually send an email from anything but [noreply@blizzard.com](mailto:noreply@blizzard.com).  Have a hard time believing this is legit.
---
"Yo have you tried square wheels? They work just as well!"
---
As you ruin the fun of other people who are also paying.
---
Jokes on you. I'm the sole shadow priest in my guild.
---
Word, when I saw the census I was saddened by this fact.
---
I believe west of the bank is a forge, but the anvils are only in VoH
---
It‚Äôs the same or higher if you kill the same amount of mobs, which you should do faster between the two of you. If you‚Äôre just racing through quests, many of which are ‚Äúkill X amount of mobs,‚Äù and then moving on, then you‚Äôre only getting half the experience that you normally would because you‚Äôre sharing it now.
---
I think you misunderstand. Skeram horde doesn‚Äôt blame alli for leaving. It‚Äôs 100% blixzard‚Äôs fault for not having clarity of faction balance nor giving ANY solutions for it. 
---
Also it‚Äôs PvP server... the EXPECTED mentality is to fight the opposing faction for contested things. That‚Äôs literally the point of a PvP server. It‚Äôs not our fault that not enough people made alliance toons there/too many horde toons, there was no way of knowing...
---
Afk? Of course
---
You've probs got a minimum of 5 years or so of classic servers if they aren't permanent (don't become tbc or whatever happens) so I'd say you're fine
---
oh jeez, why isn't everyone kitted out in BIS BOEs?
---
For each full layer there should exist a server for those people. Since blizz seems to be worried about dead servers and player drop off, they decided to use layering which only temporarily solves the problem. 
---
If or when they decided to turn this off, ALL of those people will be flooded into a single layer and were going to have massive population issues along with crazy ass que times. You think the first week was bad? Multiple that que time by the number of layers that exist on your sever and thats the REAL que time you should expect once layers are removed.
---
It‚Äôs basically always useless. A specific case in pvp the spells tone can be used. But the Firestone gives melee attack power and 1% crib and it‚Äôs outclasses by an +shadow power offhand.
---
Luckily I found this out in time, I have been in BRD farm groups since 53, now 55, and gotten some pre raid BiS already. Saving up those quests for gold. Sure, might be some monotone way of gaining more but questing seems much better and easier for me too at higher level as holy.
---
How does it even do that though
---
What if im specced hybrid? What will it show?
---
And how does it detect it?
---
Does my details tell them what I am?
---
What are alts?
---
With the amount of time it takes a group to form and everyone to get to the dungeon and start going.... yes there is a need to tell people prior to inviting them. Waiting 30 minutes after inviting someone and into the start of the pulls..... that is not ok.
---
And yes I agree. Reserving loot is dumb. I am much more the "just run it multiple times" kind of person.
---
Warden staff ranges from 300-800g depending on the server, I DO NOT GIVE A FUCK IF YOU CAN USE IT FOR A COUPLE OF LEVELS.
---
500g is more than half of an epic mount everyone can use the large sum of gold for equally as good of an item for themselves if need be even.
---
Example: I'm a warrior, warden staff drops and everyone needs. I win the roll. Upset the druid in the group but I sell the staff and buy arcanite reaper.
---
Your warden staff is just as "USABLE" as the gold that bought me an arcanite reaper.
---
That‚Äôs dogshit for mages lol. What an idiot
---
The difference is spending a few hours to clear everything vs. multiple nights. Most of us have jobs and would rather get it done as quick as possible. 
---
Seems like you don‚Äôt know what meta stands for.
---
While it is true end game gear sets are speced for resto you can most definitely tank and feral dps, but you will have to work twice as hard in kitty to be competitive to a pure dps class. And druids can tank anything  including naxx, while they straggle a little bit behind a warrior tank there will always be a place for you.
---
there's been some damning screen shots of his fellow guildies apologizing for the behavior as well as multiple responses from people in this same thread on the specific realm's reddit trying to defend themselves not giving loot based on performance.
---
westfall is quite active, but i doubt most players there even know there is a server discord or sub.
---
They can leave the area, call for help, go to a different zone, or go to a normal server. 
---
What‚Äôs your issue?
---
I have run SM Arm about 15 times and never seen ravager drop. Is this ridiculous?
---
Though, right now with economies as they are as long as you have a solid source of gold then its relatively cheap.
---
You'll just be a transmute bot if you level alchemy without herb. You really do want herbalism if you ever want to make flasks - Black Lotus is Bind on Pickup, so you can't trade or sell it to other players.
---
If you're so good at pvp go roll a horde on HS and show them you don't have to outnumber them to beat them.
---
Could if ‚Äùclassic +‚Äù is the route they decide to go
---
60 dungeons: Heal and Tank is very good. A feral would be good enough for them too.
---
Caster: dont think its viable without proper gear.
---
Raid: Heal or if you find a guild also tank is good / viable. 
---
A more progress oriented group has no free slot for a caster or feral.
---
greets
---
It's a BoE, get rekt salty drood
---
Written like someone that wants someone to switch to a crap spec so OP can get a raid spot they've been waiting on.... =)
---
That could legit be a job, follow Rexxar around all day and people just /w what the cords are. For like 5g?
---
Oh that easy just slice and dice and move onto the next target
---
I doubt it is. That would need like 160k+ exp which is ridiculously high in 1 hour.
---
&gt;We're not fans of the Foresaken either, simply tolerate them
---
They live on your city!!!
---
how is this getting any upvotes at all... offensive and simply not true
---
How did you make it all the way to 60 without going inside ironforge... ??
---
Another factor is this is also an economy that we've seen before.
---
That's never happened before in WoW where we have seen what will be in demand and what won't and so the young economy is being heavily impacted by that.  Truckloads of folks did certain things because they "knew" it would make them money.  Turns out since everyone did that, no one made money.
---
Level with feral then go thunder chicken...unless you like sitting and drinking after every pull.
---
That was a joke
---
Best spec is rerolling
---
I know one that isn't but she \*is\* married so its a matter of time until the prophecy completes once more.
---
Tag people on the roof with a 1 week rez sickness renamed roof sickness.
---
Thanks for this.  Is there somewhere that details what spells benefit in what way from + spell dmg?  Is there any difference in the effectiveness between spell dmg and school specific dmg (other than the obvious).  
---
I'm also curious, so right now, with eye of the beast and ToEP equipped, I am at 8.62% crit, 301 frost dmg, 197 fire dmg.  With ToEP and Reed equipped, I am obviously at 6.62% crit 226 fire dmg, 330 frost dmg. 
---
In raid it seemed like having more crit (eye of the beast) was giving me better numbers just due to the crits.   
---
Is there a baseline crit % I should be looking for right now?  I'm not really sure how to think about all this.
---
Yoyoyo where did you get that I'm complaining? I said I've never even seen this "roll need on epic boes" -behaviour ever. I didn't think it's a thing but guess some people just are ninjas and thats that. Play the game the way you want. I'm not touching NA servers so you guys can keep this ninja-stuff to yourself, ok?
---
2h tanking is fine. Shaman tanking is fine. Offspec healing or tanking is fine. Outside of raids, all of this can be fine. 
---
But let your group know if you are going to 2h tank after SM or so. Why? It may not be viable depending on the group composition, group level, group gear, and the content you are trying to clear. 
---
My alt is a resto shaman. I went resto early as I play with a warrior friend. He 2h tanks and will 2h tank through probably ZF and beyond. But if it were a pug past SM, I would want to know the tank is a 2h tank. Why? Combine a 2h tank, enhancement shaman healer (or shadow priest healer), and low level party members for the dungeon, and you could easily be in for a rough time. 
---
TLDR: Let the group know if you plan to 2h tank, and have a shield ready in case it is needed. You may be able to tank a dungeon with a 2h weapon in one group but not in the next as the levels, gear, and composition of the group impact how easy it is to clear content with a 2h tank.
---
We high pop now, but I dont know how it is for the horde, it feels even but coming from stallag it could be imbalance and I just dont wanna see it.
---
There are Horde Guilds pugging MC and many more will be starting MC in the next week or so. Remember that originally when they opened this server, it was people who couldnt play during the queues - so working adults. It makes sense that it would take those player types longer to hit 60.
---
In the next two weeks, expect 4 or 5 horde guilds to be running MC.
---
Can't the players be stupid without this being about alliance vs horde?  Bad players bad, good players good ,most of us are some degree okay.
---
That said, red=dead and never stop pvping.
---
People may still be under the assumption that /startattack doesn't work in classic since it was added after vanilla. All the macro advice threads I read before classic launched said to bind attack and make the macro click the bound attack button to start autoattacking when you used the macro'd skill.
---
You're observant.
---
Help me figure this out. Which class is better, Hunter or Mage, and why is it Mage?
---
The hard truth is if you Alliance on Skeram you should transfer off.  You can argue/moan/complain against it but that's what you personally have control over and you should do that.
---
Or. Or. You could not be an asshole and attack low level players just trying to quest.
---
Lol exactly what I thought
---
Leveling will probably be easier because zones won‚Äôt be packed and level 60s will be in high level zones. The honor system punishes people for ganking low level players.
---
Yeah, MMOs are about politics at their core.  Not mindlessly killing mobs.  
---
That‚Äôs what a lot of modern MMOs miss - developers spend too much effort on the combat and ‚Äúcontent‚Äù, when they should be developing systems that lead to interdependence, drama, and player-generated content.
---
I was just standing around because there was a crowd, halfway through people started yelling about Alliance
---
I have a cheer macro and everytime I see a fellow dudu I use it and jump around them
---
Welcome to the internet friend. An unfeeling void of information, nothing you can do.
---
As a healer, it is a noticable diff to my blue bar and the down time woth a fury over bear or prot. Even in dungeons. It can be done but meh
---
exactly.  
---
Also, it's also ironical how normal PvP servers embrace the Warcraft RP immersion just by how players act around the game. For example:
---
* In Warcraft III we see a partnership between Humans and Orcs to destroy a common enemy. In the end, we see that some humans think that "all orcs are evil and should be destroyed nonetheless" and some orcs think likewise too. So it's only natural that some Alliance players will cross ways with horde players and let them do their business... but... sometimes you are gonna be suspicious... "is this Horde one of those who want to destroy Alliance on sight? Or are they more like Thrall and Rexxar?"
---
* That is not to say that some races are not more prone to mindless killing... and, surprisingly, the horde players that act more like killing machine zombies are the undead players.
---
As an Alliance druid, due to being used to the Cenarion Enclave neutrality, I always cross my path with Hordes and  let it be. If I see Undead, I get startled, based on how many times I've been jumped by mindless rogue zombies.
---
Are you honestly asking that question? There is no such thing as hyperbole sickness
---
&gt;On the contrary, it's great at everything if you play it right
---
I wouldnt say they're great at everything... they can be GOOD though. They're never gonna be the best tank, the best healer or the beat DPS, but they are perfectly viable in all those roles.
---
Don't tell him. Why would you tell him? That shit is just too hilarious and 40 people is more than is actually needed to clear a raid. Make that Fire Mage your mascot.
---
What level are you? How many BoEs have you even seen drop?
---
It‚Äôs still warm. Aren‚Äôt you gonna unzip?
---
Maybe you should write a letter to blizzard since they allow me to do this. I think you have an issue with the way the game is designed, clearly.
---
What do you mean, that's an investment opportunity!
---
Stop trying to make it retail. Check the loot table and use notepad
---
I‚Äôm not hating on the horde pop there or how they spend their time, was just stating the facts about population
---
No. A mage can still perform fine without being frost, but if a mage is shooting fire in these raids, that's a different problem. That person needs help.
---
Aye, we tolerate them. We vouched for em'. Doesn't mean we agree with them. Being a good ally means helping those who you may not like.
---
I don‚Äôt know maybe this is a stupid excuse but whenever I watch something with subtitles I feel like I don‚Äôt focus on what‚Äôs going on in the show as much.
---
I dont have any issues with loot reservation. Doesnt it make sense to create a group that limits the competition on hard to get items?
---
Spriests are same as affli locks, dots to multiple targets, focus on one. As a feral druid that's exactly the type of dmg that would fit my tanking, as I'm AAing one and swiping all.
---
Having said that, in 50+ lv60 dungs tanked, I met exactly one spriest. Rare breed.
---
I don't see this as an issue because it happened organically, and this has been happening since ye ole' days and isn't something that can be "fixed". They offer server transfer for a reason.
---
It's just unfortunate you chose the unlucky server &amp; faction for which fell to this.  
---
You are only discouraged from playing because that's your subjective ideology. Nothing is actually keeping you from playing and your sense of "waste of time" is only happening because you choose to think only certain situations are playable and you simply refuse to accept otherwise.  
---
*Personally*, If you are already acting like this then it's only going to get worse the longer to subject yourself to these situations so you should just transfer out and start enjoying the World of Warcraft again.
---
They're not dirt cheap, 20-30g was exactly how much I remembered back in early vanilla for arcane crystals
---
&gt;Again account sharing isnt extreme. You keep devaluing what they are doing compared to some easy thing.
---
It's fairly easy to box
---
Realistically you can play Moonkin, Bear or Resto.
---
Cat feral will only deal DPS comparable to a Rogue if you spend days farming Gadgetzan for a mace with 3 charges that gives 50% attack speed. Otherwise.. It's abysmal. Cats are good for prowl utility and levelling, but absolutely atrocious for raids.
---
It'll also be tricky finding groups as a bear or Moonkin. Raids will want a Moonkin for the buff, but Mage and Lock DPS is significantly better. Raids will also often take Warriors, so Bears are kind of niche.
---
No but there seems to be a sickness of people using hyperboles thinking it helps convey a message better but it doesn‚Äôt. We‚Äôre too stupid and I‚Äôm too literal but what I was getting at is that you could have given some actual helpful advice but decided that a non helpful hyperbole would, I don‚Äôt know, seem ‚Äúcooler‚Äù
---
Using soul bag while leveling? Yay or nay?
---
Meanwhile I run all over the place doing quests as 35 lvl. The idea of power leveling ruins it for me.
---
For real, you're going to be running those dungeons for loot anyways at Max level if you don't do them.
---
Teach me your ways, sensei
---
Sure, but kicking ass as an underdog or with an original playing style is more fun than conforming to the cookie-cutter spec everyone tells you you should play.
---
I've leveled to 52 so far as holy. Regardless of spec, you always get Spirit tap and wand spec. Always.
---
Not sure either. I‚Äôm having mana issues although have been 90% soloing on that toon. My vanilla priest was in groups much of the time til 40+. Or I now suck at priest, LOL.
---
The true tragedy of this story is a Mage going into the Skinning profession.
---
DKP rewards attendance over time.  A fantastic way to lose your best players who have carried the guild through months of raiding is to let a part-time raider roll against them for BiS gear.
---
I have an issue with people going into low level areas and killing low level players for the hell of it.
---
If Freezing Band dropped instead, the druid would have justified their need roll with "Well, I can sell it and buy Warden Staff", 100%.
---
He kicked up a massive stink over a literal non-issue and got rewarded for it because PR.
---
Please explain how this isnt a Karen move.
---
For fuck sake, I'm in the 8%?  This is what frustrated me in Vanilla.  I just couldn't get as much free time in as *40%* of the rest could.  By the time I *finally* hit 60 in Vanilla, everyone had run Molten Core, BWL and Naxx so much, no one was raiding anymore.  I barely had any time before TBC came out and then I was left behind again.
---
I mean, one of our feral druids went on to be top5 in BC arenas.
---
And the experience I'm talking about was both pre and post 1.12, through AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I'll be honest with you - our lone prot paladin had a better defined role (aoe trash tank). Feral can tank sure, but it is a suboptimal MT and straight up doesn't work in a lot of later content.
---
Any raiding guild worth its salt will have at a minimum 1 warrior MT, the same can't be said for feral in any role.
---
I like big kitties but they dont like me :(
---
Yeah I've got two pretty gnarly twink items and they're staying in the bank. I don't care how desperate I am for gold atm.
---
I know i don't know why i typed it lol. I'd just cod them something.
---
annd this is why i play a female
---
I moo at all taurens, idk why they never reply im trying to say hi.
---
Dude a green with +spell dmg would be better than this. Quit memeing.
---
By buy I hope you mean with ingame currency.
---
If you aren't in a dedicated  guild that has chosen you to receive it then your probably shit out of luck. Get in a guild and contribute more than anyone else and respectfully ask to reserve it.
---
Thank you, I will give this a shot tonight.
---
&gt; Druids could not use equipped items in shapeshift forms. 
---
Still can't use healthstone in forms though.
---
I bought one for 40g the other day so take that for what you will. If one dropped for you and you can equip it and have a mount I'd just use it. Will last you til 60 for the most part.
---
he was a bloodthirsty brute as early as wrath... explain that away
---
he was a good leader out of nowhere in cata. he was always bad. him being bad is the norm, not the exception.
---
&gt;Or can they wait until after the fight is over to invite?
---
This wouldn't work.
---
&gt;Do they just leave a raid spot open for me to jump into before the fight, and hope it drops, and then pay the master-looter all of the monies to give it to me?
---
That would probably be how it's done.
---
Herbalism sword?
---
This one is pretty obvious, they don't want to have to merge servers too often and have 0 idea how long the playerbase is going to stay high. If they released servers with the original caps they would likely end up with a lot dead servers and be forced to merge them. Having a higher population means that if this die-off happens there is still a good amount of people around and only a few low pop servers need a merger.
---
Give it time. If you are pugging end game dungeons, then you are  a person (or your group) are people who likely play every day and have taken some time off. This is not the norm. I took some time off myself and am only 54.  I play every day for a few hours and my guild has 50 active members with only about 8 60s - who have played non stop. Anyone that transfered to heartseeker horde side was probably sitting in queues for the first week - like my guild.
---
Also, most people are guilded and running those groups with their guild. 
---
Given these facts, I have no doubt that pugging BRD, Strath, LBRS, Scholo is difficult. Give it a week and i bet it way easier.
---
But, to the orginal point. - Horde is outnumbered 5 to 1. Go to any contested area town and its easy to see. It could actually be higher than that 10 to 1 in the later levels.
---
In Arathi Highlands if I get killed by skulls I go on a murder spree of anyone I see.  Don't care the level.
---
Yes Dodge = CP with Setup. I didn't know you could resteath with gouge. Besides, I've noticed a lot lately that of I'm in the vacinity of another fight, I can't stealth because I'm "in combat" it happens enough that I wouldn't bother trying to stealth with gouge.
---
Why do i get no exp for killing the deviate dinosaurs on the way to WC inside the cave but before the instance?
---
As long as there's mutual consent, I see no problem with this superhero.
---
The human zones are generally far better optimized, and Ashenvale will be a warzone.  Personally I get to 15 or 16 in Darkshore before going to Westfall, makes it so you don't have to do as much (or any) of the dwarf zones to keep your level up to the quest levels.
---
Come on guys, these fuckheads deserve to be ‚Äúwitch hunted‚Äù can‚Äôt let ninja looting slide. Apparently mods are in favor of ninjas.
---
 I'm looking for a list of gear that has increased attack or stats "when fighting X' type of mobs.  I can't find this filter on wowhead and google results come up dead.  Anyone have this info anywhere?  Thanks.
---
dude on my server the cloth is selling for more than the bags are -\_\_-
---
For Hand of Sulfuras?
---
There's more than one server for people to play on.
---
Cleave has been used as a way to describe compositions in arena for wow since TBC.  It has nothing to do with twitch, it was just a logical carry over from a nomenclature standpoint.
---
It's because loot is already defaulted to the druid
---
Someone undercuts you and now the price of the item is 10% lower next time you try to sell. Do it a few times and you‚Äôve lost a significant portion of earnings. 
---
Do your thing dude, idc - but acting like it doesn‚Äôt effect you is a bit silly.
---
Same
---
Statistically that would happen to 1 out of every 11 people, so not that rare.
---
An awesome website to utilize is bootybaygazette.com.  It can get you market history for any auction-able item based on your server and faction!
---
Drain life isn‚Äôt the embarrassing part. Drain soul is. When a Warlock casts drain soul on you they are 100% sure you are dying and your soul belongs to them... it‚Äôs the ultimate end to a fight.
---
what? 
---
part of classic is putting ninja looters on blast and having consequences for your actions.
---
someone getting the first hand of rag on a specific server has little relevance to the community outside Arugal. would a post like that get removed???
---
Nobody knows for sure, but most people and websites seem to think it will probably be sometime between blizzcon (Nov 1) and the end of the year.
---
Vegas Pro 14 mate, that's my favourite one
---
Ninjalooters are wasting my time. People who don't announce loot reserves and stuff before, or just after inviting me also waste my time. Therefore they are in the same trash bin.
---
I hope your sleeves roll down everytime you wash your hands
---
Except the spawn rates are proportional to the number of people on the realm, so while it does increase supply it also increases demand.
---
You'll probably be fine. May need to bandage while he spins though.
---
Honestly, I hope this phase lasts a long time.  
---
It's so cool to see classes leveraging their strengths without 100% of people using pvp trinkets and grenades. (But I'll enjoy that too)
---
He had just gotten his ww axe and wanted to try it out.
---
Pretty much this, most runs I'll only need to drink if there is a particularly messy pull.
---
It's a little inaccurate for some patrolling rares like Galak Packhound (set at: level 26, 10+ mobs, skinning). I'm guessing because it's based on wowhead's map locations, which there are lots of because they patrol.  
---
Other than that it's really nice. It's a bit surprising that sometimes lower level mobs are worth more. I'll definitely be using this as I level.
---
I didn‚Äôt make the switch to ele until 52, am sad I didn‚Äôt do it earlier.
---
they wont be, Blizzard needs to intervene or p2 will kill the unbalanced servers.
---
Plenty more coming!
---
That's just funny. If I recall correctly, I tanked a lot of BWL and AQ40 with the Bloodlord's Defender from ZG. Of course I dreamed about TF, but knew I was never going to get one
---
Shadow is more than fine healing any current content. MC and ony are such easy raids anyways in current patch.
---
Kodo (says the alliance human...)
---
Damn. Stranflethorn went in. üò∂
---
Because I‚Äôve done this content multiple times over as many other players have. Again, a lot of us have jobs and families and would rather spend the time we have to play doing other things. Before servers went live a guild tried to recruit that had four 4-hour raid days, if that sounds enjoyable to you then go for it.
---
Internet bullying? 
---
Oh come on..
---
Yeah, I think they only become one of the best tanks with WotLK
---
Classic has hugely exposed the flaws in class balance of the original vanilla being transferred over to 2019.  Everyone knows now that hybrid DPS is shit, back then it was kinda just take whoever messages you first.  Now, basically every hybrid is forced to heal even if they're not specced for it.  Naturally this is leading to an overabundance of healers.  Mage or Lock is definitely where you wanna be right now, if you don't like tanking.  And I know its blasphemy and all but the LFG finder probably would've alleviated a lot of these issues.
---
Certain fish are valuable for certain classes. So they sell on the AH.
---
1.2g a stack for thick leather is profitable for a Nightscape Tunic flip. Any less and people buy it all, leaving 1.3g as the median for people who need leather but can‚Äôt or wont farm it.
---
Inv plz
---
23 is a strange lvl to swich sword since meteor shard from arugal is almost better than any sword of the same  lvl. even for SS.
---
I have two accounts. Will that help?
---
It's from a wetlands quest for the alliance. You need herbalism to use it
---
Glad you found it.
---
Just because there is worse doesnt mean it isnt bad...
---
Yeah they always sell for double vendor price at least on the AH, steady but low income.
---
If all the phases were released to begin with all of naxx would be cleared already. Just because MC is cleared doesn't mean phase 2 will begin any time soon. For some reference this stage of the game during vanilla would of been over a year in and phase 2 would another 6 months away. My guess is p2 will be released in the next 2-3 months
---
We've had ghetto census data since week1, and it's been pretty obvious how unbalanced the server is. Bliz has never provided that info, and their solution is free xferrs which has worked really well for us.
---
Oh I get it's a PvP server, and it may be hindsight talking, but if I would have been Horde month 1 on Skeram I wouldn't have been raw dogging every Alliance toon I came across with 4 of my buddies, especially since "everyone" knew free xferrs were coming soon. When you see you're outnumbering allies that badly surely it has to cross your mind that they're leaving at the first sight of an xfer if you keep grieving them just trying to get to dungeons and shit?
---
Got a legendary drop and my guild said it‚Äôs super expensive to craft
---
you should be, you definitely should be. Fighting other players will always be a million times for dynamic and exciting than playing scripted PvE content.
---
Farod I want my sweatshirt back.
---
What the fuck?
---
Okay wow that really does sound bad. Combat daggers is better I suppose?
---
The prot warrior would basically be able to do two things: tank the bosses in AV and flag carry in WSG, with the caveat that in WSG if they send spell casters after you then you will be significantly less of a tank. But spell casters are also much harder to sneak into your base to try to take you out, so pretty much if you can make it through the open field you are a damn good flag carrier. To a minor degree, this logic would also hold for holding points in AB but then you're more just trying to delay so your team can rotate because you won't be able to do enough damage to 1v1 anyone. That's really the area where the prot warrior would be noticeably worse - the ability to do any damage whatsoever.
---
You can also just be an arms warrior and swap to a shield and defensive stance as needed. You won't be as tanky as a true prot warrior but that would let you just be a normal PvP warrior that can kill things and then be tankier for flag carrying/boss tanking if there's no true tank.
---
Faction imbalance can super affect queue times but I'm pretty sure they are going to launch battlegroups when they launch BGs. So there will be a pool of servers clustered together and you won't just be queuing up for BGs with people only on Whitemane. Hopefully blizzard does a good job of looking at the level 60 statistics and creates battlegroups that are as close to 50/50 as possible but I'm sure there will end up being battlegroups that are still one-sided. On those, the higher pop faction will wait for a long time and the lower pop faction will get almost no wait time. Of course, the lower pop will also probably lose more of the BGs, so sometimes it's a matter of do you want an instant queue with a good probability of it being a loss or wait 30 min for a good shot at winning?
---
Well yeah, you shouldn't keep listing an item to the point where deposits and AH cut are actually losing you money.
---
I'll try to list a green once, maybe a couple times if I think the stats are good enough that it *should* move. But if gets to the point where the buyout price minus deposits/cut would equal the vendor price, then I just sell it. 
---
Time investment shouldn't be an issue. If I find a boe on my main/alt, I just keep it in my bag until I get to a mailbox, then send it to my bank alt. Never should be pausing questing/leveling to fly to a city and list items.
---
Ah ok, but still destro is both useful for pvp and pve
---
Except what you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt in the spirit of PvP. A challenging fight between two similarly leveled characters can be fun. You‚Äôre just picking off lowbies because you‚Äôre salty a higher level character got you.
---
Yes and I need tons of gold my guild said it‚Äôs like 6000 gold? I‚Äôm not sure
---
Bonk would love more friends!
---
Dollars
---
Ok maybe I will do
---
Well, it being a soldier is irrelevant. The grave could be for a dead car  park attendant or janitor and it'd still be disrespectful.
---
Thats why i stopped... i want my talent trees
---
Go watch world-first kills of Ragnaros instead, you'll see their 40-man group had at least 3 of every class.
---
Sure, Warrior is the best tank, but that doesn't mean Bears are worthless.
---
Sure, Rogues are better DPSers than Cats, but that doesn't mean you don't bring more utility to a raid than they do.
---
Sure, Locks have infinite mana, but that doesn't mean a Boomkin can't be effective if they prepare correctly.
---
Sure, Priests have a wider arsenal of healing spells and Holy Pallies never go OOM, but that doesn't mean a Resto Druid is not desirable in a raid.
---
You already said you tried Priest and Paladin and didn't like them... They are the best healing classes, so if you're not going to play them, you better make it work as a Shaman or Druid.
---
In the end, don't let other people tell you what you should play or how you should play it...

I'm going to buck the trend and say that I also use primarily Regrowth and Rejuvenation while healing. I find there are two advantages to this:
---
At a glance, HoTs are less mana efficient, but they provide roughly as much total healing. I find HoTs to be more mana efficient if you can commit to regenerating mana for most of their duration. Usually one combination Regrowth+Rejuv lasts the tank for the whole pull and you can just regenerate mana. Consequently, I highly prioritize spirit.
---
The advantage of HoTs is that you can cast them while the tank is nearly full HP. As they take chip damage, the HoTs will remain efficient, and the tank's total HP will serve as a buffer in case something bad happens. To be efficient with Healing Touch, you have to wait for the tank to take a lot of damage (so you heal the full value), so you run the risk of a bad situation (adds, consecutive crits, etc.) endangering the group.
---
The net result, in my experience, is that the tank's HP and my mana stay full all the time. If you're in a situation where HoTs don't keep the tank up and you're forced to spend mana frequently, then you should forgo them for Healing Touch spam.
---
You get XP for each turn-in of Linen, Silk, and Mageweave, and for your first turn-in of Runecloth.

The game needs gold sink. Epic mount is a good rewarding one
---
Did you do this for Fortnite a year or so ago? Great stuff you're skilled. Reconize the style
---
Lol how are you just gonna come post straight up lies?
---
Yo are we talkin about Bryce?
---
If you‚Äôre in a raiding guild and are their MT, then just ask for gold. If they don‚Äôt want to help pay for your mats, then find a new guild. Good MTs are well sought after.
---
I hope Blizzard is dreaming big as well.
---
I spent almost 300g for my Devilsaur set at 55. Lol

God damn the jump at 2:00 got me good.
---
You can bind the markers in the key bindings menu. I have skull cross moon as shift e/r/t. Super convenient. I originally just had macros and this is way easier.
---
Well it was meant to homegenize loot distribution I guess
---
Not to me, but then I am in no hurry.

I‚Äôm a mage but mana potions make my hemorrhoids act up terribly and I need to stop and apply lotions to them with a sock.
---
If he's casting a fire spell at a fire mob at 60 you should remove him from your raid without saying anything.
---
Wait, there are three RP servers aren't there?
---
Because they made a conscious decision that the gold was better spent elsewhere.
---
If you‚Äôre all similarly leveled that can be fun. If you‚Äôre killing players 5-10 levels lower than you then you‚Äôre kind of the asshole.
---
I have no idea what you're even trying to say at this point. Your first comment was flat out wrong. Auctionator always undercuts by an absolute value, not by percentage. By default.
---
If you dont have anything positive to say, just move on. Not everyone has to play the game the same way and its doesnt affect you in the slightest.
---
I seriously have no idea what we're talking about. How is going shields down against ninjas not "putting the group first"? What does this have to do with racing to 60 or wanting an epic mount? 
---
Trusting pugs not to backstab be when hundreds of gold is on the line doesn't seem relaxing at all to me.
---
on skeram everything is fucking high
---
Do you see how he moves away from the guard after he kills you? It would have aggro'd to him if he stood still. 
---
The rate at which guards go from unfriendly back to friendly is quick. Also, lower level players aggro higher level guards easier than higher level players, just like mobs in the world.
---
I'm picking up what you're putting down.
---
Also not fair to gimp a class just because vanilla's design didnt make sense. The devs were also still figuring out how the game should work. It does suck, and there should be some measures to make sure things are fair decided within your guild/group. At least when it comes to cloth, most classes that get a chance who arent clothies are healers anyway. They may need some similar gear but often it seems healing gear slightly differs from the usual dps pieces a bit
---
&lt;3
---
All daggers basically. Faster = Better.
---
Realistically, you need to play a different class dedicated to gold farming, let's look at some options:  
---
1. Roll a mage to 60 and AoE grind. Pros: Decent gp/h if you can find a good spot. Cons: Leveling a new class to 60 will take 6-8 days of /played and a lot of the good AoE spots will be crowded.  
---
2. Roll a warlock/hunter to 60 and solo dungeon farm. Pros: 40-60 gold per hour if you practice it and have the gear. Cons: You need pre-bis to get higher gold numbers and you will still have to level someone new to 60.  
---
3. Flip the AH. I would not suggest this unless you are already really experience with this.  
---
4. Farm dungeons forever on a warrior and pray for some BoE drops. Pros: You have a level 60 warrior. Cons: Probably lower gold per hour since you will have to constantly find groups and move to dungeons.  
---
6,000 Gold is no joke. People usually have guilds help them fund legendary items. I've never really seen someone solo farm it all. You basically have to commit the next month to just farming and try to not get burnt out somehow.  
---
Even on my warlock, if I'm making 50G/hr, that's 120 hours of efficient farming (if I never buy anything else, repair, consumes, etc.). If you played for 6 hours a day, that's 20 straight days of doing nothing else.  
---
Hope you are up for a challenge.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da4cr8/help_trolls_are_holding_me_as_hostage/). 
---
&gt; It's not rocket science.
---
I agree, but it's hard for the RL to make it all happen in real time, while also trying to PuG the rest of the group up. It makes a lot more sense to get it all out of the way once the group is full, before people start moving out to the instance. Then again, it makes a lot more sense not to do reservations.
---
&gt; Which is why it is the leaders responsibility to inform people otherwise.
---
Yes, I think we've already agreed on that point, not sure why we're still discussing it. If anything we disagree on when the RL should be informing the raid members.
---
&gt; It is much easier for 1 person (the leader) to discuss with people prior to inviting them.
---
I don't think so, especially if multiple classes want multiple items reserved. Then the RL must continually make sure no one he invites could possibly want the reserved items and with people rolling for their offspec, that makes the tedious task of forming a raid group that much harder.
---
I mean, for UBRS, sure, it's only 10 people, but in a 40-man, I wouldn't expect the RL to keep up with everything people want to reserve, if he allows reservations.
---
In the end, that's why reservations are garbage and I tend to just avoid groups who only care about loot. I just grab whatever loot I can along the way and repeat instances as long as I still need shit from them.
---
The OP made an innapropriate meme out of a photo he never should have touched. Just pointing that out.
---
In my defense, it was 3 am and I forgot layering was even a thing in capital cities, but you're right I definitely learned a pretty easy lesson.
---
When layering is removed it will feel much more alive!
---
I'm around 200ish hours played. Didn't take any time off for it, still holding a career that demands 40+ hour a week and still being a responsible adult when needed. No kids though, just a girlfriend that feels a tiny bit neglected. She knew what she signed up for though, I warned her well in advance.

This is a troll copy pasta from another thread on here today.
---
Realistically, all shadow gives is 25% more shadow damage and 6% hit. The staging shadow debuff is okay but by time you get to 5 stacks the target is dead. Reduced mind blast CD is nice too I suppose. Mind flay is worse DPS and (mostly) worse damage per Mana than smite. 
---
Holy gives 5% crit, 10% smite damage and 25% of spirit as healing power. This stacks with spirit tap btw. 
---
When you math it out your mind blast / SWp do about 5-15% less damage over shadow depending if spirit tap is up, but smite is a far better filler than mind flay. Honestly comparing the 2 specs you're looking at about even kill times and Mana use, with the bonus that you can heal really well. 
---
I leveled holy In about 7 days / played. Zero regrets, shit was cash money.
---
If you go to one site you'll see server is 75% horde go to another and it says 75% alliance instead.
---
No way to know any more except, log in and look with your eyes.

If you have to ask...

That was my plan, but may just hoarde them instead.  You know what sells well?  The winter squid recipe.  Sold that sucker twice with a 400% markup.

Thanks for your reply) I will try to find information about count of simultaneous mobs, not a count of spawn locations. And it will definitely improve statistics :)
---
&gt;not be greedy
---
Well what's the difference really between being paid for a service and receiving an item as a trade for their service?
---
I wonder as i've had the pleasure of some which were absolutely fantastic, share the link only to hear back that it was removed for lack of effort or some bs like that?
---
Short answer: probably.
---
Moderation is a shit show and will probably delete your memes arbitrarily.
---
Do you even realize that layering doesn't affect the amount of people that are allowed onto a server. All it does is split a population's int shards it doesn't affect the maximum allowed people on a server you retard. zone has a thousand people Max no matter what for example was shorting it put that thousand people into 200 people per Shard still a thousand people per zone.
---
How about you learn to do some fucking math.
---
You're not sitting on it for longer than 3 months. Phase two brings in twinking. With the majority of they player base well past the loot range for many of these items, drops will be far rarer.
---
Twinking will create a very high demand for particular items.
---
You might want to try reinstalling AtlasLootClassic. As far as I'm aware it's the only addon that does what it does.
---
Not sure what you're looking for, but Classic Wowhead should have everything from phase 1 listed. Anything past that is in their DB you just have to search for it instead of it being listed in a menu.

You need to keep in mind that from a design perspective, WoW's primary reward loop is accomplishment. This isn't an eSport; gameplay is very simplistic and there's little to no skill involved. If people aren't getting something done, they're probably not enjoying the game very much. Moving quickly isn't about "rushing," it's about getting those repeated dopamine hits that we're all here for. You might as well ask why someone is rushing to finish a tv series instead of watching the commercials between episodes. The reason is that it makes their average hour of screen-watching less fun.
---
&gt; utilizing a sit macro for Enrage procs (which is very hard to pull off properly in Classic)
---
From what I've read that does not work in Classic at the moment
---
Sick.

Metas exist no matter what. You can choose to not enforce it, but they still exist. By all means play what you want and have fun, but don‚Äôt be surprised when people aren‚Äôt as accepting of that play style.

Well then what are you saying? By saying ‚Äúleveling will be hell in phase 2‚Äù combine with ‚Äúhonor system but no Battlegrounds‚Äù implies leveling will be hell because level 60 people pvping will kill you in open world because they have no where else to go.
---
nope you're we go again with all the fucking retard to retail whining and bitching and complaining and ruining another fucking thing that we thought we had to escape the fucking bitching and whining baby from retail.
---
I'm so fucking sick of Blizzard pandering to the fucking cry babies that they don't remove layering by the end of the next month I'm unsubscribing and I will never fucking subscribe again.
---
In what part of that comment did you read. "I'm so good at PvP" stupid pleb
---
It's true. Daggers are way better at the start.
---
Fucking gross. I'm sorry you had that experience. 
---
Fortunately our guild never had issues like that. Those kind of people didn't last long in our guild. Literally we booted people for ninjaing shit in random pugs or dungeons. We tried to make sure we had good people. 
---
If we ever had trouble around loot, it was getting people to actually take an upgrade. Something would drop and the people interested would express interest (didn't matter what loot system we were using), and inevitably the person who was going to get it saw it would be good for someone else who expressed interest and try to pass it to them. Literally sometimes it was a battle to get people to actually take the damn gear! No one wanted to be greedy and everyone wanted the raid to succeed so everyone was happy to forego an upgrade if it would help someone else more.
---
Well, for one like I said this is standard for basically every guild that takes progression kind of serious, so there aren't actually a lot of different options.
---
Also in progression guilds the aim is to progress - not to gear your character. You do what is best for the progression, and that is prioritizing dps. What does it matter if I can get a 99 heal parse on Ashvane but we fail to kill the boss because we lack the damage?
---
And if you take bosses like Ashvane or Orgozoa, where you have hard break points that you need to meet, healers are always required to deliver dps too. On our first kill of Ashvane I played with dps trinkets just because how we didn't really need additional heal, but dps.
---
There's also the fact that it isn't necessarily easier to find guilds as support player. Especially tanks are mostly recruited within a guild, because you want people that are consistent and have a high raid attendance, which is not a sure thing with new recruits. As a heal it matters more what your class is - priests and pals will have an easy time because they are meta, but good luck if you're a monk or rsham.
---
They are on Bleauxme as well. Still just as annoying
---
as a non caster a good weapon upgrade will save you so much time grinding, and make you use less consumables that it is worth it even if you dont get your mount straight away
---
Once you've done most of the northern area and the buzxboxes it dries up very quickly.   Maybe enough to get you to 17, by then most of the quests are either orange or require a lot of running.  I did a pretty well optimized quest route just like 3 days ago and that's exactly what happened to me.
---
As a warlock, given no constraints on gold or time (assume unlimited), is it worth it to spec 225 on blacksmithing to get the anti fear trinket for raiding and PvP?
---
The other prof will be specced to gnomish engineering to get the trinkets then respec to goblin.
---
They can not use intimidation while poly'd. Intimidation is a cast the hunter makes that buffs the pet's next auto attack. hunter plays an animation and everything when they cast it.
---
You have no idea how that soldier felt when that photo was taken.
---
-Conjures water-
---
-Drinks potion instead of water-
---
Only with in game gold, yeah. That‚Äôs my main plan, but I‚Äôve heard about guilds selling it off, so just trying to understand all the options in case RNG screws me.
---
Yeah haha literally the fattest folder
---
People really discount the first few seconds of a pull more than they should.  When you‚Äôre tanking, you REALLY need that first hit from all the mobs.  From the warriors perspective, you charge in (or shoot pull) and then start laying down a few shouts and whatever AoE.  It‚Äôs about this time that everything should have taken one swing at you, giving you enough rage to start cycling through your real threat generators.  
---
If that doesn‚Äôt happen because the hunter opened with multishot, the priest immediately starts dotting everything, and the rogue picked a full HP target because ‚Äúforget skull, they want to build combo points‚Äù, the tank doesn‚Äôt get that initial burst of rage.  Without that rage, there‚Äôs nothing you can do except taunt to pull things off people and get them hitting you.  I could care less if the mob is going to instagib YOU, I want it hitting me so I can use the abilities that make it keep hitting me.  
---
If I have to use taunt on something that has minimal aggro because either you got initial aggro by jumping the gun and lighting up his friend, or tagging something I haven‚Äôt touched yet, well, its better than letting it run to the back of the group where the healer ends up in melee range and takes aggro at 110% threat  from healing your squishy ass.  I mean that‚Äôs probably going to happen anyway because you guys had no concept of how threat works, but at least I got a hit from the enemy out of it and MAYBE that lets me get a sunder off.  
---
So yeah, warriors lose aggro to a stiff breeze those first few seconds because you didn‚Äôt let them build rage to use the abilities that keep them from losing aggro to a stiff breeze.  I swear, if people payed as much attention to their tank‚Äôs rage bar as they did the healers mana, a lot of pulls would go a lot smoother.
---
I like the zooming in on the 52 immolate. I know them feels.
---
Ungoro leather farming. I do arround 120 - 150 gold per hour 120 for selling just the leather and 150 if i sell the gloves
---
I made the mistake of trying to build towards soul link at the beginning. Its fun to play, but when I respec'd to Drain Tank at 40 I started MELTING through mobs and my down time went way down. I really have a lot of fun playing it. Its resource management heavy, but once you get the feel of the build down I truly think its one of the best leveling builds out there.
---
I care
---
Even so, I still ultimately have plenty of fun in PvE. I have goals of shit I want to make in Leatherworking. Dungeons are easily a highlight of my day, especially when I step into a fresh one. I also love having to travel the world and sneaking into places I shouldn't be. Sure, I can do that all still while having the added tension of half of the players wanting to kill me... or I could just relax instead.
---
I've made an alt on Grobbulus for some later PvP should I want to, but I'm too busy atm leveling my rogue to want to spend time on that.
---
I logged into retail last night to check out the Worgen and Goblin changes. I noticed they deleted all of the PVP realms... (okay the realms are still there but the only realms are normal and RP now) 
---
I wont be shocked to see removal of factions. : (
---
This should be how the game is played. Unfortunately, people are saving money for their mounts, so they are hesitant to spend that extra silver on a very short drink between pulls.
---
Oh, thanks, I didn't know.
---
That was never for every single player, just the majority of the retail base. AND it's still true. There are plenty of people who hop on the train and dont realize what they rly want.
---
It sounds like you're seeing Enrage as the core component that makes Fury relevant.  It's just icing on the cake.  To try and explain what I mean here's [the build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20305020332-55000131005410051) I'm running.  It works for me.  I don't miss sweeping strikes in the context of the two areas below where currently spend all my time.
---
5 man Dungeons DPS
---
1. Trash clearing is trivial and routine for any competent group.  Whirlwind, Cleave, and Slam are more than enough to keep me busy and relevant on the meters in groups.
---
2.  I want a button to push gives me an edge on dungeon boss burn.  Death Wish is that button. 
---
3. Flurry on a 2h weapon with Windfury Totem is just plain great.
---
Solo leveling
---
1. This is where enrage is great.  Even though you can't force it to proc on yourself.  When you have it proc you are just plain grinding more efficiently. 
---
2. Flurry is still great here, even without Windfury Totem.  Again, just plain efficiency increase.
---
It does help that I've consistently funneled gear, food, bandages, and consumables like rage pots to my warrior from my Hunter Main.  Even without those items, I would choose this route due to the fact that it's what I'll end up using at 60 for raiding.
---
Sounds like a greedy dick.
---
I don't care what your repair bills are, that's part of rolling your class. Why should everyone else have to pay you to do something you need to do for yourself anyways? The entire game is based around grouping up and accomplishing goals, not paying the plate wearers for blessing you with their presence. 
---
If everyone starts requiring payment for what they provide, you're gonna have mages charging for CC and water/portals in groups, warlocks charging for summons, etc.
---
I'm sorry, it's a pasta as another user pointed out, I was just being silly.

---
It's really not hard to nab last hits for spirit tap, and I'm still doing solo content in between. It just helps sustain in every situations, regardless of spec.
---
Holy damage in solo content is about comparable to shadow. Shadow starts really taking off in longer first when shadow weaving comes online and especially in PvP. In straight solo PvE content where you just nukes+SW:P+wand or some short rotation like that, holy competes just fine with shadow.
---
Holy dps in late game is actually quite a bit better than shadow both in raw DPS and in mana efficiency, but it requires lots of +SP scaling and a ret pally for holy buffs/debuffs.
---
In my defense, it was almost 3 am and I totally forgot layering was even a thing in capital cities haha. Definitely had a "duh" moment hence the "got me pretty good" in my OP haha. I won't be making that mistake again for sure.

I'm now weighing an [Arms/Prot Warrior](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/053250203520100031-05-5025011) (something like that) against a Feral Druid. Do you think one of these is much better, as a whole, at PvE tanking and BG PvP?
---
My locks lvl 25 I've already stopped using VW since it doesn't hold aggro this just hitting coa, corr, immo. I tried dropping immo and wanding still pulled off tried using DL instead still pulled swapped to succy mobs die faster I'll be glad when I get a little higher and can drain tank properly to cruise to 60
---
1) 2 points isn't that big of a deal. I would just leave it for now. Plus, there are times when you can't mount and you still get some use out of this talent.
---
2) It's probably not worth it to get improved traps. You're missing out on some really good talents in Mark (extra crit damage is big), and there's not very good talents in the first tiers of survival. However, it's ultimately up to you, and it shouldn't be that big of a problem while leveling/doing dungeons.
---
U sir got a sub
---
Just cause
---
So... who else buying hella think feat for cheap? People are starting to catch on so better snag up your bis 19s items
---
You only see the opposing side's dishonor, because your side's dishonor isn't happening to you.
---
Also, gnomes are vile beings of concentrated hate that make even Sargeras look like Mr. Rogers.
---
It‚Äôs probably a matter of getting bored of PvE and wanting to experience a surprise PvP event while they‚Äôre questing. It‚Äôs not seen as a disruption to playing, it‚Äôs just an added element
---
Layering exists because there are also more players per server, which means the demand is also bigger due to a bigger base of consumption.
---
A single layer of 70k players total just means a lot of people will be broke or semi-broke as there won't be enough resources available to generate income (due to everyone fighting over the same limited resources) except dungeons.
---
I spent a lot of time fishing the past two days.  Most fish vendor for like 6 to 25c.  A couple like stoenacale eel vendors for 1.25s.  Some are good to AH because it helps others level fishing easier. But we are talking maybe selling for twice the cost.
---
Firefin snapper, deviates, and stonescale seem to be the best because they are used in potions. 
---
You could also try and good the sage fish and sell the food.  Not sure markup there.
---
I spent 8g on a fishing rod and haven't recouped the cost yet...
---
Yeah, that's why I never pledged a frat in college.
---
That‚Äôs true, but with the weekly lockout and low drop chance, just trying to see what else I can do to accomplish it.
---
Yes tanks get the benefit of finding a group if they need it because of multiple reasons.. reason one being...uh... no one wants to fucking tank.. it's boring and stressful and also unsatisfying for the most part. I'm not saying I wouldnt run the dungeon but if I'm literally only in that dungeon for the 2 handed sword that drops and I'm a dick for saying that I'm only there for the 2hander and I would appreciate it if I could get it if it drops then I dont know what to tell you. I do agree that it should be one or the other but not that people are dicks for asking for something.
---
You can see out of those!?

No battlegrounds in phase 2 means very few twinks.  Won‚Äôt have BGs until phase 3.

Once I hit 40 in STV I started making gold pretty fast. Lots of boe green drops!

Well, they are advertising to you because you are someone interested in WoW and/or you've been to gold selling sites before.
---
I play a Paladin and I have to buff every 5 mins which uses 20%-30% of my mana. I'm constantly stressed out that I have to manage my mana well enough to buff every 3rd fight. Buffs drop, people get upset, I'm at half mana. I don't know what else I can do. If the group went 20% slower I would be 90% less anxious the entire run. 
---
Thankfully I'm tank spec and get to tank 60% of my dungeons and being a mana bound tank who has to buff every 3rd fight I have not choice but down time.
---
LOL. To each their own.
---
I'm in no way a religious person, but I do try my best to live by the rule of "Do to others as you would have them do to you." Both IRL and in-game. :D

I'd take it for permabalanced servers in a heartbeat. Look at live Mal'Ganis. That's a 15-year history. This problem doesn't get better, it gets worse.
---
drain tanking.... stop wanding.
---
That is a sad way to look at it. I greed on every Boe item i dont need. I ask people to roll for chests and share what I dont need from them. This is not a solo player game.
---
The guild should give him mats for a two hander he won‚Äôt use for guild raiding purposes? Ok I‚Äôll bite, why?

I think that is correct... I haven't been spammed as often by them.  Even having the invite to channel thing blocked it still pops up in chat and I have seen a lot less of it.

so instead people have to be scared of getting ninja looted and always ask loot rules and take SS's ahead of a dungeon/raid to make sure they have the evidence. if what OP provided wasn't enough then basically you are basically asking him to do what you don't want to and always screenshot/record gameplay.
---
I‚Äôd like to play the game how I want to play it. Thanks for your input though!
---
You can also /tar the NPC and use the key bind "interact with target" (default: F)
---
Probably the instances.  Zul'farrak, Sunken Temple, BRD.  Plus some of the zones are considered fun like Plaguelands, Un'Goro, Felwood, Winterspring.
---
Thrash and then mirah‚Äôs
---
You'd lose another bag slot to a wand dust pouch quiver and be down to 3 bavs. After your shard bag. Is that more interesting?
---
I guess I appreciate that this guy wants to do the right thing and say that the meme is distasteful, but no dude I'm just a 59 shadow priest enjoying the last day I'll be able to solo any mobs semi-efficiently.

What doesn't make sense to you?
---
Finally a video of a warlock being good at pvp.
---
Would be nice to get an answer from Blizz about what happened to #nochanges and why this is not a bug.
---
&gt; A summoned Infernal that is no longer under the control of the Warlock will only affect PvP flagged targets and targets that are on its threat table and will quickly despawn when no viable targets are available.

but if i log into my Warcraft logs page and i dont see AT LEAST Orange parses then i have brought Dishonor upon my family name, and disgrace to my whole account that i must delete in order to restore myself

It's fine as long as you don't keyboard turn

Are you the 52? I'm the 34.

Your first mistake was rerolling from a glorious hunter.

Dunno

You know who's not raiding? People who died. Like the ones represented in that photograph. Making this incredibly insensitive and inappropriate.
---
Lol, you people are so fucking funny. 
---
Hur dur I'm gonna act self-righteous and say these people are greedy fucks for needing on something that could get them a BiS BoE. But I'll do the exact same thing If I see everyone else doing it!
---
If you need gold you greed. As simple as that dont be a total dick to people that want gear they will use
---
[Immersion](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24931-ImmersionClassic.html)
---
Having trouble picking between mages and warlocks.. looking for some advice on what to pick just can't decide :(
---
Your idea of Greed is something you made up in your head, everyone Needs gold equally. If a BOE staff drops and is worth lets say 100g, as a warrior I can use that 100g towards buying an Axe of equal value.
---
We both need the drop regardless of who can equip it at that exact moment.
---
If you have a mage. Just run drink inbetween packs
---
You are spot on about the hybrids.   I was amazed to see how many druids there were on day 1, and how few there were by level 30.  I hang out in the LFG world channel.  I even have a dedicated chat tab for it.  It's what it is.  Just frustration.    
---
I knew I would get downvoted for saying something negative about the sacred cow, but I don't really care.    
---
I figure I will respec shadow and just run solo.  If it doesn't pan out, I can quit.
---
A bad one, good luck with that.
---
Mage need rolled on skullflame shield over me as tank. Im like whatever man.
---
fuckin' cave\~! and \[people told me SV would be the most terrible place!.
---
Loaded up with 3 months off the bat.
---
Because you feel like you have to be hyper vigilant about ninjas to begin with.
---
This makes your actions and decisions that much more weighty.  And if you mess up and don't click the right button, doom will surely follow.
---
I'm not 'shields down'.  It's not important to me if that epic that drops get ninja'd.  Why?  Because it doesn't matter in the grand scheme.  I'm not going to lose sleep over the fact I didn't win a roll for a Khrol Blade and need to farm up more money.
---
If anything, the idea you have to be 'shields up' against ninjas means you are so focused on the monetary value of the run, you have forgotten what it means to play the game for fun.
---
If you want to raise your blood pressure each run by worrying if your group mates will backstab you, you are going to burn out very quickly.  If you simply trust that people are, by nature, not going to fuck you over, life becomes less stressful.
---
Look at it this way, you don't view everyone who walks past you on the street as a threat.  That would be paranoid.  Likewise, if someone is acting odd, you don't ignore it either.  Accepting that you have risk in all things you do in game is a fact of life.  Attributing more risk and danger to something like BoE drops in a dungeon is just taking up space in your head that could be better utilized, like your skills, the environment or other things.
---
Think about it this way, which group do you want to be a part of?  The one that always clicks greed except for upgrades?  Or the one that clicks need because everyone should click need to prevent being fucked?  If everyone clicking greed when they want money sounds better to you, why bother with the drama over 'zomg need everything so you don't get screwed'?
---
I'm not gonna grind for several hours straight to prove a point; that's boring and stupid apart from just simply not having a time block like that available. I've grinded shoulder to shoulder with shadow priests before, and they don't kill shit any faster than I do.
---
Here's the [math](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6vdfy/shadow_priest_or_holy_priest_pve/f0wlp37/) if you want to actually have a conversation though.
---
Yes, and in a perfect world, you *would* select "greed" if you just want to sell it.
---
Alas, we don't live in a perfect world and I don't trust any people outside of the guild to equip that rare item they just rolled "need" on.
---
How do you feel about paid server transfers for classic? I am absolutely against it for the same reason as that final line of your statement there. Ninja looters will always exist, but if name changes and server transfers become the norm, it'd happen much more frequently, in addition to other general issues and market imbalances (I assume you can bring one character's worth of goods with you, but I honestly don't know).
---
I keep seeing people request the service but I cant help but be against it.
---
The 30-40 bracket is the absolute worst, not just mathematically but emotionally. You are no longer low level but not quite high level: you get the worst of both worlds in a lot of ways.
---
- Quests are beginning to drag on and travel distance to do content has increased, but you don't yet have a mount to compensate.
---
- You don't yet have all the high level tools of your class to deal with tricky situations/pulls.
---
- You get into pvp zones in the 20s, but mostly they are faction specific. In the 30s you are seeing zones where both factions are trying to get their stuff done. STV is the most famous example but its also true of desolace and arathi. You are extremely vulnerable while questing in these zones due to the lack of mount.
---
The 30s bracket starts to pile on a lot of the challenges of higher level content, but you don't yet have all the tools to cope with them. It gets significantly better after 40, just keep your nose to the grindstone and don't get too discouraged.
---
&gt;uhhh, the debuff tooltip on me read over 40 seconds the other day
---
The debuff tooltip doesn't change for pvp but the duration does.
---
&gt;2 stuns together should never be less stun duration than 1 stun solo
---
You're essentially saying that it should be impossible to order abilities incorrectly.
---
Warrior doesn't know how to play his class,  u/chubsmcbeardface: "fucking mages!".
---
Stop downranking.
---
You are doing something wrong if you need more than 50% mana for a pull that isn't a boss.
---
No, killing BT is a must vs enemy faction.
---
Didn't have a checking account and had gotten rid of my credit card cards.
---
Obviously not.
---
wut! thank you!
---
I do believe it is a bit rampant in classic. It did happen back in the day, and I don't have a true comparison of how it was back then. All I can say is make your own groups, do your own thing, and ignore those that are reserving stuff. If people want to joing their group then so be it. I don't have any problem with it. I make groups all the time, don't reserve anything and have no problem with it.
---
Vanquishers in the OH for the attack power is what I would do.

---
42 lock here. I find Dark Pact just skip underwhelming. I could either spam it like 15 times or life tap once and drain life. Maybe it'll improve with +SP gear or something, but for the time being I almost never use it. Am I missing something?
---
Added you to my KOS list ;)
---
.... just use something and level up. Did you just come here to brag about the items you have? I don't understand. You can level up just fine with greens and none of those weapons will last you that long at 60.
---
Agree 100% w/this Jalapeno eatin' sum beeoch!

I have keys on my mouse bound to some of them, don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm a noob at WoW but I play other games with loads of keybinds

Take my upvote
---
My top tip would be to move then drink, you are gonna get much more time to drink this way.
---
Same here, leveling a warrior is just as slow and painful as everyone warned it would be. But I'm looking forward to quickly gearing up at max level and getting my revenge in STVietnam.
---
(And yes, I got your joke lol)
---
Gold is not equal to or better than grar. While you do need the gold, the gear can help you make much mire gold than what the item is worth.

Low-key keyboard turning is useful for when I'm going long distances with auto-run and my phone is on my right hand. I have the buttons set to [ and ].

Oh no, you're retarded.

Because two wrongs don't make a right.

You can check your server's forums on the main classic WoW site, or if your server has a discord server you can look there too.
---
And you blithely ignored the photograph of a person in mourning because your experience matters more.
---
Stay classy.
---
Got em on my mouse lol
---
No sorry if you are having constant mana issues, you are doing it wrong.
---
Are you downranking?
---
Look at the 'dps' section on the weapon. If weapon A does 60-105 damage with 2.5 attack speed and 40 dps and weapon B does 100-160 damage with 3.8 attack speed and 30 dps, you're better off with weapon A because it does 10 more dps.
---
From what I recall, I was at about 30-35k XP per hour when questing on all cylinders. What really helped my leveling time was being able to get into tons of grinding groups healing. I got into a mage cleave brd prison group that took me from 48-52 in a single (long) day, and I did 57-60 pretty much exclusively in school/strat. 
---
I'm on a plane now but when I get home I can screenshot my /played which will showy 1-60 time

No it's not an ethical problem lol.

---
LOL, you gotta slam dunk on OP like that? PS roughly $1 per gold... which one of you sad fucks is paying that?
---
I would suggest finding a better guild.
---
You should put him on your KOS list and next time you see him corpse camp him. I'm *sure* his "top 4 Horde guilds" will come and save him lmao
---
That is completely fine. What would be absurd is someone tanking an instance with keyboard turning.
---
They're all conditions that can be grouped together into the same general category, you half wit.
---
Its what you are supposed to do, op is doing it wrong and blaming the tanks imo.
---
The Leon from Resident Evil 4 death sound sealed the project. A+
---
Or murlocs, yet we can eat them
---
Or gnolls
---
Yo, what addons are you using for questing?
---
Great feeling, Congrats!
---
Check out sixtyupgrades.com. There are a bunch of better items than smite's hammer, even some quest greens, but that item is definitely strong and can last you a while.
---
LMAO layering is a joke worst thing ever
---
On a similar note I‚Äôve made 200g from essence of water because tailor mages need it for archmage robes
---
I don't think this is a witch hunt and you will set a bad precedent for further situations like this by deleting this post and others like it. These people are ninja looters and it should be spread to the high heavens that they are. What does it matter whether or not people from other realms see this post? They aren't on their realm and nothing but this persons in game name was given so without being on their realm or making a character specifically to harass this guy and guild. This is literally the spirit of Classic WoW, when people or guilds in the community do bad shit they earn a reputation for the rest of their time on that character or guild. You shouldn't remove it out of fear they might be harassed in game, when thats exactly what the classic WoW community is for. There are consequences to actions.
---
Should be ANY sad person, grieving ANY loss of human life. We gotta show some respect, man. It's common decency. Liberal, conservative, athiest, muslim, christian or just plain indifferent to it all, it still matters how we show each other respect.
---
Yeah ,  I may be showing my age but I think bullying is a stronger word now than it was when I was in school. 
---
I'm still pretty sure if you were able to nix the area of the brain that received pleasure from knowing others have misfortune -ganking would be way less. And in that way it is "evil". A harmless evil in a game.
---
But you have an interesting take on it I admit.
---
Special magic dust = fucking mana
---
Either an addon, laptop overheating, gpu drivers need updating.
---
ayyy gordo

lemme get sumodat guuuuuuuuuuuuud kush
---
Exactly, I found a dude yesterday rocking the whirlwind axe at 57. He admitted to passing up both rockpounder from Ulda, and passing Angerforge's axe from BRD. "WW axe is slower".
---
Not to mention server populations are likely to be over ten times what they were in retail vanilla. 
---
That's ten times more people collecting ten times more stuff putting ten times as much of that stuff on the auction house = very low prices.
---
There's a lot more people on each server so the frequency of epics is higher.  But it doesn't increase our individual chances.  I have just under 10 days played with 0 epic drops outside raids and I did a good amount of mob grinding to level.
---
They're epic for a reason.  You may find only one boe epic non raid in your whole time playing the game!
---
Don't burn yourself out farming just to make the legendary. If you know what you are getting yourself into and have the support of a guild then go for it. Otherwise, I would recommend you stay away because this is a really easy way to burn yourself out and ruin your enjoyment of the game.
---
I played the f outta hunter in vanilla up to naxx (only killed first few bosses tho).
---
I never had an issue getting into raids. The further we progressed, the lower I was on damage charts but it wasn't a big deal. For me, I love PvP and especially world PvP. I think hunters are the funnest and one of the deadliest classes in world PvP. Theyre also really good in 1v1 PvP. So, fun + effective = good class for me. I played a Shaman and Shadow Priest before my hunter and then a warlock. Hunter was my fave by far
---
Broken Tooth is not a 2 hour spawn.
---
Depends on the groups loot rule set up, most groups don't discuss all green BOE drops because they're seen as low cost fluff from any dungeon run because you just vendor them all.
---
 /who doesnt show everyone in a zone, so its not even a good idea of class makeup of the zone you are in, let alone a zone on the other continent.
---
There are so many variables, yet its treated as even remotely accuate. You might be saying "its not 100%", but that doesnt stop all the doomsayers from relying on it.
---
Its garbage data, even moreso since the amount of time that has passed since the addon broke.
---
I love the Daequan sound bite in there.
---
Underrated comment, here.
---
It's no biggy. I figured they were probably new to Classic altogether, either from retail or just the game entirely. And the angry messages make me chuckle; at first I didnt think they could be serious.
---
Regardless, if you're using Questie or any other kind of add on, or you're being guided, always give the quests a quick skim if you dont want to read the whole description. Itll help save some time here and there. "Oh, I need to be targeting THOSE particular satyrs." Or "Ah! I'm supposed to summon the mob!"
---
And good luck on your adventure. Welcome to Azeroth.
---
Bout to start running this place with my rogue this weekend, love me some SFK
---
Never used flairs before. Didn't realize. Thanks
---
so 10 man should follow the meta so that 30 others can play what they want?
---
now making an alt for BOE epics ... seems so obvious yet i kinda totally forgot .... o m g
---
Meh, seems only people that actually enjoy doing dungeons while leveling are people that have a set group to run with. Took me forever to find a group yesterday (as a healer even) and when I joined our tank had to leave so it was another 20 minutes of spamming general for a tank before we could even start the run. 
---
Anyway, dungeon runs when you play this game solo and aren‚Äôt in a guild are absolute fucking ass.
---
Everyone's experience is different. I rarely found myself the aggressor while leveling horde, often getting killed by groups of 2-3 alliance in the 30-50 zones. People in my guild often asking for help with groups of alliance killing them while questing.
---
I'm just using them as examples of infrequent things, to show that something being uncommon has no bearing on how it should be treated.
---
&gt;Blizzard very much should just let it happen
---
Ehh. It's something I think will need to be addressed if the game ever goes free to play.
---
I just don't see a reason to gift people large sums of gold for no reason.
---
Also *mumbles in Enchanting*
---
Hmm.. I should go play a different game... because I dont want to spend 3 hours in a 45 minute dungeon...? 
---
You realize later theres a undead strat quest that you have to do in under 45 minutes. 
---
Good luck with that one
---
&gt;Because the entire game is based around group content.
---
and economy. if you're not in need and he is and it costs him 4x as much per run (to the point that it seriously makes a dent in your cash), it's not unreasonable to try and recoup that cost. 
---
&gt;Why should groups have to jump through hoops to fill their roles if there's a tank needing it too?
---
because there's a lot of groups looking for a tank and very few looking for DPS? he could simply go join a different group or even form his own and probably run the dungeon before you get a group together in a lot of cases.
---
 If you feel entitled to someone elses hard earned gold or loot because you think your job is thankless and unfun, then roll something else.
---
If you feel entitled to tell someone else how to play and manage their hard earned gold or loot because you think your jobs role is valuable when it isn't, then roll something else.
---
&gt;Nobody is asking you to sacrifice you enjoying the game so you can get a leg up on everyone.
---
Neither is he, if you don't like how he's going about it, find another tank.
---
Hm, I jumped the lava inside BRM quite well. Like 15jumps and only one time fire damage. Is the lava behaving differently within the dungeon?
---
Fuck warlocks are so op
---
lol okay, now we're saying being a greedy is fine because it's in the RP description for the class?
---
Demanding loot/gold in order to do something you were going to do anyways is greedy, and if you wanna be known as that guy, go for it. I'm just saying, people don't always forget , and reputation matters more than ever now.
---
no the system is literally Need if you are going to use the gear, or greed... stop trying to convince people you aren't an asshole. 
---
You are an asshole. 
---
Your logic isn't accepted because why should you get priority to get gold to go buy something, when the guy who can use the shit that dropped is right there.
---
This is Classic wow right here. Can‚Äôt wait for honor to be a thing.
---
Thogg says: "Thogg get healer, thogg very happy".
---
If you haven‚Äôt already, change a and d to strafe instead of turn, it‚Äôll feel weird but my god it‚Äôs effective in both pvp and pve :)
---
What level 15 actually has gold? 
---
Answer: none unless it's an alt of a high level.
---
Na anything of high value it's just a given it's all need. Even recipes in my runs so far people just need. I was a 300 alch at the time and lost the supreme power. I was super annoyed and the guy said he was close to 300, I was annoyed but moved on. Same guy posted it from his main 1 hour later for 200g lol.
---
Cloudkeepers dropped in another scholo and a mage ended up selling them for 850g.
---
Unless it's a group of friends where I know that person would make use of that item then just all need it. No hassle.
---
And it's fine that people are reserving. The problem is when they recruit a full party/raid and get to the instance and start clearing before telling everyone about the reservations. Just let me know when I join so if the one item I'm going for is reserved, I can look for a different group instead of wasting my time, leaving after just a couple pulls.
---
Are you vendoring stonescale eels bro?
---
As someone who played on private servers for years and got to see all kinds of specs perform well I'm super annoyed by all the people just regurgitating YouTube content bias. They say stupid shit about how specs aren't viable when their only experience in classic is their level 26 main still trekking through ashenvale.
---
It ain't much, but it's dishonest work.
---
The circle of hate is real. The horde that kill me dont know the monster they've created and are in some sense hurting their own faction's players
---
He was also bottom of the management restored meter, he basically just didn't use many spells by the look of it.
---
I report every person I see asking for layer swaps, even guildmates. 
---
I wish I could report Blizzard for bad design, but I'm at least enjoying myself *enough* to stay subbed. It really needs to go soon, though.
---
There shouldn't be any issues if the loot rules were established before the group was created.  If people dont like groups that are reserving loot, they can just make their own group. There is no issurs in trying to make sure no one else in the group needs the same items as you do, it's just smart. 
---
It is dumb its mentioned after the group is running the dungeon.  In which case I'd just leave and find another group and not group with them again.
---
In hardcore guilds where threat is the tank's #1 job, nothing can touch a troll.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da4rvo/im_done_with_this_server_but_made_one_guy/). 
---
what if i told you how much you undercut by barely affects whether or not it will sell. the real determinant is demand.
---
I agree. It's novel, but not funny.
---
As a healer I found myself a pally tank in SMLib, been dungeoning off and on together since, 43 now it is beautiful having a tank I can trust. Smashzilla you're amazing.
---
Yes, but you can swap weapons in combat. Start with pummeler for threat and then swap
---
People who say layering is the cause for the low prices have something wrong with them
---
I don't know anything about the picture.  It's a meme.
---
It literally could be anyone mourning the loss of something important.
---
A meme to experess a feeling.  That's it.  You're making a big deal out of something that was not intended to cause any harm.  Also, fuck off with your attitude.
---
Not only greedy but insane as well. lol
---
Nice backronym but meta is short for metagaming.
---
I'm real new to WOW so I am not sure what "w.e." means honestly. It might actually be a green but I will confirm when I can run home on lunch in an hour or so.
---
Get off the AH.  Thats why you're broke.
---
Mostly because there are some bad defaults in Auctionator that people aren't careful about.
---
It's one of the reasons I prefer TSM4 -- more complex, but I can bake in a lot of things to my "don't sell below this price" like vendor value, or what I paid for it.
---
? This goes for every class that needs a BoE BIS item.
---
I just used Warden staff as an example but as a Warrior I need Arcanite Reaper, this is craftable and sold on AH for roughly 800-1000g. I can use that gold from a BoE to buy my BiS as can anyone sell a BoE to purchase their own upgrade.
---
By the same token people should gear up the people they play with your wallet will take care of itself.
---
No van but got a forced name change after 2 years in retail for my priests name which was cottoneyejo
---
Scummy people wasting peoples time. Not only should you immediately leave the group, but you should pull half the instance and preferably wipe them. At least what I would do.
---
You do you, but it's an encrypted login through a battle.net api portal. The only info they request access to is your battle tag and it's likely just so they can keep track of how many actual, active bnet accounts are using their service. Not sketchy at all.
---
And make her stand juuust out of kick range.
---
Buddy of mine charges 1 leather or the equivalent for every piece he crafts.
---
After a handful of crafts he can make a piece for free and sell it.
---
Yeah... not sure what the point of the post is?
---
Because you‚Äôre not gifting anyone gold when they equip that BoE item and can no longer sell it. No offense man but you have a shit attitude. Anyone who needs on everything that drops in a dungeon is a fat avoid for a lot of people.
---
Now there's a great idea.
---
Lol I am, just getting to lv 31 on this character. Have previously played an alliance Druid at 60.
---
That is what DKP is for. If people winning too much was a problem then a simple DKP system would have solved that. 
---
Honestly not rolling for a month is insane and the guild leadership should have seen this. 
---
DKP is not a new thing. It was being used in Everquest which came out well before WoW. 
---
If they didn‚Äôt want to use DKP a loot council with  pre assigned roles also works. 
---
There were so many options for the leadership of the guild to use and they used none of them. It‚Äôs either laziness or incompetence.
---
Take that back.
---
gz!
---
I can see a little of that inspiration! Would have been cool seeing her calling for her Paladin though. An action shot or iconic moment is what he's is all about.
---
Did you hit your head or are you unfamiliar with how to express sarcasm over the internet? I was agreeing with you, ya water buffalo.
---
Classic wasn't supposed to happen.
---
This meme makes me feel uncomfortable
---
&gt; It seems easier to call "reserved gear" once the group is full and ready to go, than to repeat it every time someone joins in.
---
All it takes is a copy/paste PST before the invite.
---
"FYI Blah blah blah is on reserve. If that's ok, I'll invite. If not, sorry to waste your time."
---
Yes but that item may worth more as a gear than as gold for someone else in the party. And in order to let them have it you have to greed instead of need. If no one else needs it as gear, then whoever wins it gets its gold value. Same with disenchanting, i may neet so enchanting mats but that‚Äôs not the same in any way as needing it as a better gear
---
I remember auctioneer being popular in vanilla. People were constantly typing in the command to figure out prices in my guild.
---
Also AH addons undercut by 1c when people manually undercut by a lot more.
---
To add to this, this behavior was common in Vanilla.   To everyone who wants to avoid it run with a guild or friends.  This isn't retail you hav eno excuse for not having a vibrant friends list or guild at level 60 which will run all high end instances...
---
I was questing the entire time. I grinded 59.5 - 60 just because I was excited to ding 60. If you are having problems accidentally aggroing with succubus, you can have her use invisibility. I suggest using the classicwow.live guide for questing.

Go run SM or farm mobbs preferably with skinning(Not essential) thats all you need to do
---
Why does a MT need Hand of Ragnaros? Seems like a waste of gold for a weapon you would realistically only use in pvp.
---
10% off or of?
---
i prefer to leave them empty, makes for less to look through but to each their own
---
You don‚Äôt need to no but I advise you to do them. 
---
If you ever plan on doing endgame dungeons you really should be doing some as you level to learn how the group dynamics work, in the end you will be expected to know your role.
---
a Kunai is a Shuriken...
---
Locks don't level burst because downtime. They level affliction or affliction drain tank. Burst is for pvp and raid really.
---
Man this is so enjoyable
---
Oh sorry, "w.e." = whatever :) Doesn't really mean anything in this context.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Wow haha
---
I try to look at it positively. We‚Äôre on a very well populated server with currently little to no queue times since the transfer started. There are a lot of cool players and an active community. While I have a number of complaints about the population imbalance, I‚Äôve grown attached to the server and like the Alliance being severe underdogs in a way. Try and make the best of it! There are still a number of really good players and good guilds here too!
---
Like, don't get me wrong. If someone instictively rolls Greed instantly without talking about it I'll hold my roll and wait till we talk about all rolling greed for an equal shot at the item but I just don't want to say "greed all valuable items" then get shit on by an actual ninja...
---
And so will the mage, farming library 500 times. Whats the difference?
---
I'm reading that thread and the opinion seems pretty split, not sure why this was used as a response? 
---
Additionally, the gun in question isn't named, which means it may not be a BiS like the Warden Staff, the literal top-pick for Tank Druids.
---
Overall, loot rules should be laid out beforehand - it helps to solve these situations before the roll-timer puts everyone on edge.
---
I read the title as you being a mage and a tank being sarcastic saying you‚Äôre good at holding aggro lol
---
On not talking about boE drops I am talking BoP drops alot of them can be censored for for several gold.
---
Princess runs for bis ring in mara
---
That MGS alert sound threw me off, have that as my ringtone so I thought I got a text.
---
Nope.
---
HI OP!!!!!
---
Can you tell me if you figured this out? Also, do you use it ? Is it worth it?
---
I think the main difference is 21 levels.
---
Thats a layering bug?
---
Got tired of waiting for OP so made this:
---

---
When's mahvel?
---
I think the idea is more that if you were to randomly select 40 players likely at least 10 of them are going to aligned with the "meta"
---
So play what you want because the raid slots will be there.
---
&gt;So you're innocent because you didn't notice something wrong?
---
All I responded to was the talk about shadow priests speccing out of shadow form. Yet you're here replying to everybody doing this, as if they have something to say in this picture about a mourning soldier. Leave your issue with the picture out of people replying here and take it with the moderators/OP.
---
Also, I don't see anything wrong, because I don't agree with you.
---
&gt; nothing to get defensive about 
---
You're the one getting defensive, though. Look at your comments replying to people randomly writing stuff about WoW. Most of these comments don't deal with anything but the text/icons on the picture and not the mourning soldier.
---
He paid a shitload of attention during anti-drug talks in elementary school, was probably a patrol/crossing guard. Graduated to hall monitor in high school after not being elected to student council. Currently married to someone he cant stand anymore, in his hometown that he never left, working a job that he cant stand.
---
Takes out frustration on the internet instead of just getting stoned because that would go against his false belief of the last 30 years.
---
Magram backwards is ‚Äúmar gam‚Äù, which clearly means scarred legs (gams).

Your move.

Not rest at all. 768 xp per kill from elite lvl 60 bugs in silithus.
---
For flexing in PvP by melee locking them
---
Late in the original game I won the roll for this on my alt mage.  The warrior was salty as fuck about it.  Ahh random old memories
---
Isn't that just the Unit frame and not for the actual Action Bar? Can't check right now but i swore i remember that addon doesn't allow edits to the action bar.
---
Good luck man. If you're having financial issues like that it will be very good for you to step away for a while.
---
This was beautiful mate please only edit videos at 2am
---
You can continue to drink this way and not have to guess when you need to move, you sit down right in the range of the tank and when you need to cast you do so.
---
I‚Äôm playing alliance this time around but I agree with this sentiment
---
You are definitely the dick here. Full stop.
---
Mages use those runes too. And that staff is open roll for basically everybody.
---
"Grow up".
---
Ok lol.
---
That's perfectly fine too. You can be fire spec and do 80% of the DPS of frost mages. Nobody will even know unless you point it out. And you can keep those juicy pyroblasts and flamestrikes for the rest of the game.
---
This was for Arcanite transmute I see in trade, not sure what the elemental ones are, I'm just assuming those with the profitable ones are using it themselves and selling on AH.
---
Might just be the fact we aren't a very progressed server: only 2 Horde guilds with Ony and 7/8 MC. I think Alli will have 1 guild with enough People to do a non-pug MC.
---
&gt; It's almost like you are so afraid of being screwed over people that you view everyone with equal suspicion
---
Yeah? I don't see a problem with this if I make a pug group and don't know anyone in the group I'm not going to treat them like my best friends...
---
&gt;If you think "Me first" at all times, your actions in the dungeon will reflect that. If you think "group first" the same happens. Wanting a piece of gear to be equipped by a player is a good thing. Wanting gold for your mount is just greedy.
---
Dude you completely missed the point of the thread, I'm saying EVERYONE IN THE GROUP EQUALLY CAN USE THE GOLD SO EVERYONE SHOULD GET A FAIR CHANCE AT THE ITEM BY NEEDING IT.
---
Its a ninja proof system that works and I haven't dealt with a single ninja looted in 10 days /played.
---
He can advertise if he wants and it doesn't make him greedy, it makes him picky. Don't group with them, or become a tank yourself and tank for nothing.
---
Whoa.  I'm sorry Dude.
---
Hi, /u/Vigor021

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da518f/corpse_of_life/).

Well, in this case it's possible to see it as "if I ever act like this, I deserve to die as well".
---
Ignore the trolls. Good luck with whatever you're doing in life! The alliance will be here and we'll welcome you back with open arms.
---
WASH YER BACK.
---
Alliance suck but I still care.
---
Love that bro &lt;3
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a treat
---
Huh, maybe I should rebind that to something. I use F for "assist target".
---
Arms warriors can only fear immune for 10s every 30s, so you can bait the zerker rage, seduce / coil, buy time and begin to fear.
---
Fury warriors are a different story entirely, as they can also fear immune for 30s every 3m.
---
I had 90k to 60k an hour from 50 to 55 then 120k to 80k from 55 to 60 so it was pretty damn fast 10 levels.
---
&gt; Gotta coordinate for spirit tap
---
It's why I've already re-spec'd out of it prior to level 30.  Will run a pure 21/30/0 build for W-PVP / instances.
---
&gt; and made it to where I don't feel as lonley or sad.  
---
c'mon man. Just ask already.....
---
Be sure not to download it from Curse/Twitch client, but rather their website ( [https://healbot.dpm15.net/](https://healbot.dpm15.net/) ) and get the newest version for classic!
---
Can use the lvl 35 Orb you got from the lock quest earlier, but ultimately the drakestone w/shadow wrath from ST is what you‚Äôll want to get
---
Yea, you can do whatever you want with the action bars. Tons of options.
---
Honestly at this point it seems like it would be a pretty good filter to avoid grouping with people like you, which I'd want to do anyway. I somehow doubt we'd have had a positive interaction anyway.
---
So yes you nailed it on the head there with level 44. You cannot AoE as a druid pre level 44. You might find some luck doing swipe aoe grinding at level 40 thanks for Dire Bear, but you'll mainly only be able to kill like 3-4 mobs at a time like this and it will be slow. It'd probably be faster to just kill them one at a time.
---
At 44 you get barkskin. This opens it up a little bit. If you want to AoE a bunch of mobs at once, like a mage does, you will need to kill mobs that are much lower than you are, like much much lower. 
---
Both barkskin and hurricane are on a 1 minute cooldown, so it should be short enough that you can chain pull doing this.
---
But even then, it's definitely not efficient and you'd be better off waiting until you're level 60 with good gear to do this.
---
That's why people like classic. Anything worth having requires work.
---
Ah yeah you play on a smaller server?
---
Yeah ide rather max out exp / hour then nickle and dime myself.
---
She reacted that bad to the threesome?
---
you will not have the mana for this lol
---
They don't say it while advertising on purpose so they can easily get a group. It's scummy to mention it once you're already in the dungeon clearing and not when you're advertising for the group.
---
I'm surprised by how many people are saying you did nothing wrong, I feel like they would all be saying you're the asshole if the mage made this post about a feral druid taking his caster staff. I'd definitely be pretty upset if I was the only caster and a feral druid took the staff from me when he never mentioned it. If you mentioned it in the beginning like "hey guys I'm rolling for healer gear so I can start healing", at that point it's up to them whether that's cool with them or if they want to leave and get a different group, but 99% of people won't have a problem with it, **as long as you ask before the run**. Semi unrelated but I did SM Cath yesterday healing as a holy pally, we ran it about 4 times and then the healing mace finally dropped and a rogue rolled on it without saying anything. Thankfully he lost but man I would've been so peeved if he won on a mace with spirit and +healing.
---
Yeah itemrack addon works good enough!
---
The point of the thread is to establish a threshold of how much gold is worth rolling need on. rolling need for 2-4g is just petty.
---
I dunno.  It  was aimed at me and I laughed.  My brother would have too.
---
Yes, the "problem" is a lack of money in the economy. Money is generated by vendoring items and looting gold from mobs. No real way around it.
---
Until the gold sellers have a chance to really inflate the currency supply, this is going to be the most consistent way to farm money.
---
Lots of people talk about making money in the AH, but in reality it can be a lot of work finding a niche.
---
Tell me your YouTube I'll sub you deserve it after that video lol
---
Sorry I'm not a nerd that knows the value of every item.
---
Yep.  One decline is enough.    Same with duels too!   I declined dude,  so right at this moment, no I do not want to duel.
---
The amount of level 30-40 greens going for 1g+ on my server is insane. People selling shit like everybody has a level 120 main with thousands of gold to feed their alts.
---
A lot of people forget that WoW is a living, breathing world, and that's exactly why there's nothing wrong with a system that relies, in part, on good faith. That's why reputation matters in server. That's why people recognize names in server.
---
You CAN roll need on something you can't use/only want to sell. You CAN abuse the loot system. But you shouldn't. And when you do, it has in game repercussions. 
---
Advocating for abandoning a system or abusing a system, just because it requires trust or discussion, is exactly why classic turned into the retail we had today.
---
Fantastic video. Really reminded me of all the Verycoolguy videos.
---
Subscribed m8.
---
Until you get siphon life it's tricky. Fear can help if you pull to safety.
---
Worst part on my server is, IF anyone adds a crafting fee it becomes cheaper to buy on AH.
---
Same with lionheart helm.
---
What server are you on, you div like my kinda dungeon partner. ;p
---
i had to run 50 LBRS to get the gems because nobody else wants to do that quest lmao. im reserving it because the demand for UBRS is very high. thats how the game goes
---
I LOVE these videos.
---
Addon Help.
---
What's the addon that flashes your skill that meets activation requirement? E.g. Overpower shines on your action bar.
---
Are there similar skills for other classes that work like Overpower/Revenge?
---
A mage took my Wind Spirit Staff. I'll always approve of shitting on mages after that.
---
A class with an extremely mana-efficient damage spec, endless water, mana gems, and evocation does not need +15 spirit over a healer god damn it.
---
yeah it is really good. I couldnt get passed the dubs at first but the you dont need it. just watch in german language and the subs are a better translation.
---
So you're bad at the game, we get it, you play PVE and try to comfort yourself with all this bullshit.
---
But let's face it, the real end-game of vanilla wow is PVP. 
---
Playing PVE is just a process to assure dominance in PVP.
---
I'm a hunter, and I've been very surprised with how well druid tanks perform in leveling dungeons. The Druid tanks that I have done dungeons with have ALL seemed to me to hold aggro better on single and multiple mobs than the warriors I have grouped with. Paladin tanks have all seemed weaker and definitely struggle to hold aggro on anything. Please level up a druid tank! They are needed!
---
Hunter's intimidation missed, would of been interesting if it hit, as hunter could have moved outside AoE range and it would of allowed warrior to not get polyed. But I think the result would have been the same as mage would just have ice blocked earlier, blinked to hunter aoe him and 1v1 warrior.
---
And that buff doesn't stack with the mage intellect buff, so the mage doesn't get much from that.
---
Hey friend.
---
Spec, short for specialization, is a reference to how you allocate your talent points, which talents are a form of character ability customization.
---
You can change these point allocations, referred to as "re-spec-ing". Or with 2 C's. 
---
Healed is the past tense of heal, and is just grammatical, and doesn't refer to WoW.
---
&gt; cause the people I group with dont pull this dumb shit
---
Same! The people I group with don't pull this dumb shit either, because I don't allow them to.
---
in classic it is set this way. Just like a lot of other things that has since been changed for retail where Hunters cant need on cloth gear, or mages for leather etc... 
---
Trying to make this retard understand that to ninja loot is to literally need on something you are just going to vendor, ah, or disenchant.
---
Well, you have your answer. Move to a pve server. You knew what you were getting into.
---
This is a crock of shite. When I hear a dota2 player was given 20,000+ gold just to bid on eye of sulfuras then thousands more to make the mace... there‚Äôs gold out there but there‚Äôs also a huge influx of items and gold. Layering is a partial reason.
---
You don't notice the people ignoring you, but you certainly notice the ones who try to corpse camp you. Hard to tell what the ratios are, since you only remember the asshats.
---
But from my experience on a relatively balanced realm, most people are just focused on leveling and don't care much about PVP.
---
The only way a gnome could run as fast as a human would be having a third leg.
---
Would it? Presumably without layering they would just reduce the maximum number of players allowed on the server.
---
Simply untrue. Stop believing everything you read on reddit.
---
You sell the items you get to vendor. So no AH or anything, just straight to the vendor with all the loot you get from the bosses.
---
Subbed. These types of videos is what I need when not playing lol.
---
I'm okay with someone needing and equipping an item that is considered BiS for their spec, otherwise everyone should roll NEED. 
---
If I won the roll and a guy in the group really wanted to use it, I'd probably have him trade me half of it's value in gold and I'd trade it back to him if I saw him equip it.
---
Dont forget about the part in the comments where people are complaining about horde pvp
---
Brilliant, keep editing at 2am
---
As a tank/healer you are playing your role just like everyone else. You deserve the same level of thanks that anyone else in the group playing their role does. 
---
If you are going at it with the mentality that you are a tank/healer so you are more important than other players and should reserve loot as a result, then that's shitty and selfish.
---
Not to mention the classy way  to do this is to put the group together yourself.  LF &lt;class&gt; {Dungeon} PST.  This is how you get to lose cloth drops to DPS paladins because they heal sometimes!
---
It's good if you are trying to get away.
---
Well, in this case, no.  he was a real guy, with a real Character.  Maybe still on Cenarion Circle, but I haven't looked in a LONG time.
---
He was an attorney.  A graduate of Cornell and the University of Nebraska College of Law.  Played in a guild called "The Light Brigade".
---
A tank wouldn't do HoJ runs with a rogue when it has 3 % drop chance, therefore the point is moot.
---
The only way to make the warrior tank that dungeon is by giving him HoJ.
---
Naw, but she left me for the guy because she cut out every bit of support of my life, was shocked that she was my only emotional support, and then was unable to "deal with me" anymore.
---
Moving to a PVE server would be a fuckload more productive than complaining about being on a PVP one.
---
Dont QQ over the queues
---
I think these kinds of posts are important for the community, they help develop our standards of practice and expectations for players. Just because these kinds of things only directly impact people on the server that it took place on doesnt meant these kinds of mentalities dont affect the community as a whole. If you deny that this is the case, then you must be willing to gatekeeper everything to this extent. 
---
Make rules for call outs if this is that big a problem, like require the guild name and names of individuals be excluded and require people to redirect individuals to the realm specific subreddits for the "witch hunt". Don't just sweep this kind of thing under the rug and allow it to fester, we need to be able to discuss it so we as a community know where we stand on it.
---
Wtf math are you doing? You are dead wrong
---
Never stop. Always put them out of their misery.
---
Eh. drops for me have been rare in far between. My L21 rogue was trying to gank stuff with L11 daggers. I went to the AH and bought 2 L18 daggers with +10AP each for about 25s. Then a 20pk of +3 sharpening stones for about the same price. You gotta sometimes.
---
It's very easy. When you advertise a group, you mention the reserved loot in your advertisement. People who join will obviously be fine with it because they've already been told. Or people will whisper and say I will tank but I need To roll on the piece you have reserved. The leader than agrees or tells them no.
---
" just wave and they will not mess with us"

Got a Tigerstrike Mantle the other day. That's staying in the bank until a month after BGs are released.
---
How long does it take to reach max fully well rested? Casually leveling an alt
---
Personally if they went through the hassle of gathering the mats themself , i will do it for free , if they want to tip ill gladly accept it but i never charge anything for any service im able to provide. Be kind to other players and other players will be kind to you kind of deal. other than the 30 seconds it will take me to craft an item (im also a LW) or the few seconds it will take me to pick a lock it doesnt cost me anything to provide those services for other players.
---
This is very much a social networking game and the more Friends/connection im able to make the better it is in the long run.  It may never yield anything but it can lead to great things , ranging from  an invite to raid/instance group, a free service provided to me when i need it  (portal , summon , crafting , etc) , recommendantions to friends for other crafting or a repeat customer , etc
---
I have a few tricks... 
---
I won't heal up the group after a big messy pull where I'm below 30% on mana.  The worst hurt get renews and then I sit and drink.  By the time I'm done drinking, everyone will have gained some health from either food/bandages/regen.
---
After a normal fight where the next fight looks normal, only the tank needs to be at full health.  Everyone else can sit at 75%-90% health.  They get renew's if I'm maxed on mana.
---
If someone pulls it off the tank, they get to tank it until either they or the mob dies.  Unless I'm full up on mana, in which case they'll get a heal.  Melee tend to wake up when they realize the healer is willing to let them sit at 30% health.
---
OTOH, if it's a really messy pull, my goal is "as few deaths as possible" not "everyone healed to full".
---
Literally all of them. But most popular will be 19, 29, and 39 simply because they arguably take less time to put together.
---
29 is probably the most popular because you have larger room for error and wider choices in gear available while also taking less time than higher brackets to set up.
---
I've got about 11 days iirc (can't check atm). And that was done without taking time off from a full time job.
---
&lt;3 thank you! I knew my post would seem beggy, but I'm not good with words. Just genuinely wanted to say thanks for the good times! &lt;3 I'll be back in a month or two!
---
I mean some quest mobs take easily 10 minutes. Hell theres an escort quest that takes like 18-20 mins to come back.
---
Yeah, if anything is reserved it should be mentioned before starting. many people don't want to come if the only drop they want is on res. People who change to master loot right before a boss are scumbags.
---
You get innervate in your 40s. Moonkin armour paired with barkskin and hurricanes attack speed reduction, is pretty good damage mitigation. The real problem is the cooldown on hurricane lol.
---
You can aoe farm the arena spectators in brd as a priest with a high enough mana pool.
---
No, BoE Epic = everyone needs, Simple. It avoids ninja looting and it avoids people needing to sell on AH, Gold is in need by everyone. Therefore the most fair option.
---
Wow.  Show me on the doll where the bad man hurt you.
---
FWIW, I turn 50 next week, and make $200K+ as a director at a large bank.  I play this for fun and unlike you, don't take it that seriously.
---
As soon as I used AH I made like 25 gold in a few days and then hit a wall. Was selling invisibility pots like crazy and now not so much.
---
My f is follow
---
Somehow you made WoW look as shitty as OSRS hahaha.
---
&gt; This is exactly what happened in retail and battlegrounds killed WPVP forever, and look what happened to that.
---
Lmao BGs did not kill world pvp. People still fought over resources and questing areas, and some people still went around and ganked other players. It just removed the incentive for the majority of the server population to do nothing but roam around preventing the other faction from accomplishing anything.
---
Flying mounts did far more to hurt world PvP than BGs ever did.
---
I mean, it's not really the answer to that specifically. I love world pvp but it is ungodly annoying having ?? Roll up every 10m and kill you. Though I also understand it is going to happen. Doesnt mean I need to like it lol
---
Deluded.
---
Why not run SM and RFD for the two 30DPS sword quest rewards?
---
Gotta be bait right
---
Any addon that helps find where to accept all the quests related to a dungeon or some other way? Heard of Questie, Classic Codex and Carbonite, maybe those help?
---
Instances don't have maps so doing quests could be harder?
---
I would say a server is dead, when at peak time it still sits on Low.
---
Obviously you drink if a mage gives you water.
---
Played a hunter in vanilla.... now I main a mage... seems I always pick the class that gets shit on
---
It's fine if you want to build a group around this concept - I'd leave as soon as you said it but to each their own. But don't join groups or build 100% pugs and expect most to go for this. It's a community game before it's a bank account simulator.
---
Your UI makes you a bad person
---
That‚Äôs literally the definition of ninja looting lmao.
---
You are stupid to play on a PVP server and complain about wPVP. You're not forced to stay, go play in a PVE one
---
Likewise memespec.
---
If you're not too far in on your character you can always decide to pick a more balanced server.
---
Phase 2 gonna be rough for minority factions...
---
Nostalrius had a massive population and was very playable, in fact I think it made the game better as it felt more alive, with people doing content in every zone all the time.
---
And instead of spamming trade/world chat for two hours looking for a group, you could get one significantly faster as all content was always being done.
---
It also creates a bigger room for raiding, as there are more than just 2 raiding guilds per server, so there are more options.
---
I'm doing 1 a week at the moment, gonna try get like 1 edit and another different type of video done a week soon though
---
Yeah technically you'd never notice well implemented layering IRL, so it's totally possible Blizzard is already doing this.
---
Also: need new layer
---
As a Warrior player, this is basically my tactic in PVP. For some reason I can't use mobility in combat, so why run in just to get kited off with no recourse.
---
The classes that use wands already have to carry enough reagents. So no, shitty idea.
---
&gt;As a tank/healer you are playing your role just like everyone else.
---
Oh please, from a logistical perspective there's often 1 tank/healer per group.  Them fucking up has way more repercussions than one of *three* the DPS messing up.  It's not like vanilla even really does enrage timers either.
---
Even in a raid environment you feel the consequences of a tank/healer dying far more than one of the DPS.
---
Nice greats I‚Äôm still 16 gold away and I‚Äôm lvl 41 :(
---
Nice, thank you

Reddit wide rules against witch hunts are not nearly as broadly interpreted by the admins as the mods see to think

Only one who seems to be upset is you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yea in my experience it‚Äôs more of a quarter brain.
---
Well, if there is layering, then someone needs to fix the bug that stops layering on the expressway and the DMV.  Dozens of layers worth of players all in one place, the lag is ridiculous.
---
Then asshats decline just because they know you'll waste another 10min waiting on respawn
---
That I can agree on. It makes for a sour taste in every ones mouth and you will be ostracized for that. 
---
Part of why I see I deserve some loot too is because I make my groups myself, organize a WL, a portal and a key all while the other group members can sit in Orgrimmar dick in their hand while I start the summoning with the warlock and some random infront of the dungeon.
---
Just applying to a run ready to rumble and then forcing reserves is a bitch move. 99% of dungeon tanks are furies in raids anyways where they are at the bottom of the food chain again like hunters and rogues are in dungeon running.
---
No thanks, wait a month and see for yourself.  No point arguing with idiots.
---
The accuracy

Tbf I did learn from that mistake after haha

I wish I could control it tbh. Free movement xD

Like Im not going to argue with you. I have main tanked many private servers in the past. It is pretry common consensus that ss+ww w 2 hander is a good way to make alot of aoe threat (at least on 3-5 mob pulls). 
---
If I LoS pull, and a frost nova hits before I have even touched the mob, and the mage proceeds to shatter burst the pack, Im not holding aoe aggro. The frost nova makes the mo s just hit whatever's closest, fucks my rage, and then the mage crits them all. But if I sweeping strikes whirlwind, I do more dmg than the mage and can rip them back.
---
These mean different things. The meta is playing a mage as frost. The cookie cutter build is copying the frost talent tree off wowhead.com like everyone else
---
I only played in vanilla through MC, but BRD and Mara are my favorites.
---
**Layering is server merges**, but done in a way that eliminates all of the problems of merging servers. Does it introduce new problems? Sure, but from Blizzard's point of view it is worth the cost, especially when the issues are systemic rather than episodic - once Blizzard works out the kinks for layering in Classic, they can use the same layering tech for Burning Crusade servers. 
---
Server merges as done in other games aren't going to happen in WoW. Okay? Blizzard has been firm on this for decades at this point.
---
Possible, but not really any quicker or more efficient than just killing stuff single target in cat. And far more dangerous.
---
Warlock fells so powerful amd fun. I never knew. Just today I solod the 55 elite demon kirinth in badlands with 3 adds :) banished him feared one add and charmed the other, killed adds one after another and kept on banishing him for mana regen, then permafeared him and killed him. It's soooo much fun I never felt that powerful in wow.
---
You rolled the wrong faction. Alliance don‚Äôt pvp good at all.
---
There might be one or more issues. Which dots are you using? How many? How much spell power do you have? Do you have your succubus's abilities turned to manual (except maybe Lash)? Are you fighting same-level mobs or higher-level? How many mobs are you fighting at once?
---
All of these things can drastically alter your efficiency as a drain tanking warlock.
---
Ty so much!
---
If community opinion is split then how is majority decides not the right way to do it?
---
That's a terrible analogy. A more accurate one would be you needing to move some furniture too big for your sedan.
---
This is some good shit. Memeception
---
I still haven't bought feint, expose armor, ambush or backstab. I'm level 57.
---
Also don't waste money on any poison that isn't instant and maybe grab a crippling and mind numbing for PvP.
---
Absurd queue times during peak hours. It was getting better before I left but still noticeable. 
---
Very poor faction balance.
---
That's it. There's also reason to worry about the removal of layering on these massive servers but that's another conversation.
---
If you're enjoying the server more power to you.
---
The dude very obviously got butthurt over the way I worded it lol.
---
level 30. I could reroll on another server but I might just stick it out. I do have 1 friend who plays on it. Why is phase 2 going to be particularly rough for minority factions?
---
I don't do master loot. I do group loot, like everyone else. What you don't seem to get is that I'm not dictating what everyone should do, I'm simply saying what I would consider good behaviour.
---
And plate with int would be better for the paladin, but that is super rare. Paladins raid in cloth robes. That's how classic is. Which is why I think that's different.
---
&gt; People who need different items means there are fewer items that can drop that no one needs, if the group is diverse.
---
This is entirely true, but there's two ways to go about things.  There's trying to form a well-rounded group, and there's screaming in LFG for 2 hours that no one can have the item you want.  I've never once seen an item list for each member of the group, it's just what they want.  If they want a plate drop, it's not unusual for them to bring in 4 cloth wearers.  The whole thing is undoubtedly selfish, but just as it's my choice to avoid them, it's their choice to spam LFG for hours and waste people's time just so they potentially can save a little of theirs.
---
It isn't illogical to assume that there's a greater chance they won't be the friendliest people on the server when compared against other groups.  There's a huge guild on my server that formed up around people who do reservations and drop groups after winning something, and blacklists floating around respectable guilds.  It's not something every player is likely to run into, but via socializing you find out that it happens often.  WoW Classic normally has a good community, but every community has its toxicity.
---
&gt; How do you know if you never played with them?
---
I'm not really sure what the point is in just assuming this, but okay.
---
I'm speaking based on both personal experience and socialization with other players.  It's just stating an opinion in a conversation, and I've found that I have better and friendlier experiences with people who don't do this stuff.  If you've only had wonderful experiences, good for you.  Go get Timmy his shiny new reserved sword.
---
Aw someone got yelled at today for being bad, so they decided to make a passive aggressive Reddit post about it. What a surprise.
---
22 lock. Enjoy playing dungeons when I can but have minimal playtime. Ran RFC. No luck with WC yet and am slowly getting gear that may out-level that from run. I recall SFK having good lock drops and BRD having a great wand. SM.. library maybe having a good staff? What are other "must run" dungeons for locks while leveling. Shorter the better.
---
Don't be that guy who auto accepts quests, skips all the text, blindly following your quest tracker only to find out you are on the wrong side of the world because you didn't check the quest!
---
Rose tinted glasses, here. The good thing about Vanilla was NOT the balance.
---
I don't care what retail is now (I don't play and haven't for many expansions), but Vanilla balance and itemization is actually really terrible. It's worth dealing with because of the actual perks to playing Classic, though.
---
I use wowhead, back in the day we used thotbot.
---
Are you okay?
---
Wow fuck that. Ain't shit you can do either.
---
okay thats what i thought thanks
---
Because the conversation is being repeated over and over.. that thread has nearly 700 comments and the general consensus is pretty clearly that *BoE epics* are all need for pugs. And yeah, it definitely should be laid out beforehand so there's less butt hurt.
---
Alliance can‚Äôt pvp so they kill horde quest givers
---
What part of "one keybind" do you not understand
---
It's much better to have separate ones. If I can find an older thread I shared mine
---
Right on, Brother!
---
They will invest in tf. Sulfuron is a self project because it‚Äôs worthless for raids
---
Cool story.  Queues and realm populations were manipulated a ton during classic launch (with server status being changed to queue status).  Who's to say queue's haven't been slowly reduced to make population appear high, since a radically changing queue is the easiest way for the average player to see a population drop?
---
AH activity tells the story, 50%'s the safe estimate here.  It's probably closer to 70.  After the second month of subs are due, it'll be 95%.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts!
---
I play on Rattlegore. Those servers showing with characters on them were/are, 'contingency plans/name reservations'.
---
That‚Äôs cuz 0.5 is bad gear you could have just wore dungeon drops with spell power and whatever else u needed.
---
Ahh yes, we're all ninjas ninjaing each other. Lmfao nice one.
---
And then we all get sweet sweet coin, go buy gear, and no one is upset.
---
Anyone know how to add a new chat tab to the lower right chat window in ElvUI with their default chat setup? I can add tabs to the left one which seems to be the main one. i have a suspicion i can't add to that right window because it's just a separate window that was unlocked and moved, but i'm hoping i'm wrong.
---
I listed that a few times for like 6-7 gold.. No takers
---
There is actually a lot to healing well. It's not just downranking (which is more of a geared 60 thing), it's using the most efficient heal possible, including your regen, without getting behind and having reserve to help the dps.
---
It's also much more efficient to leave some headroom so your crits (not always possible).
---
I think it's very easy for healers to be the rate limiting step in a group and think they're doing well because people aren't dying, but I bet OP is using flash heal, not wanding, not positioning, not drinking promptly, not casting in bursts, overhealing, etc. etc.
---
Make friends with the folks you do run with. That way they will whisper you if they are looking for your roll. Works well for me.
---
Is it harass if we are not bothering them just assembling our own blacklist?
---
Subbed I hope I bump into you in the open world... of warcraft.
---
Here's the answer. People rolling onto PVP servers not assuming this will happen in EVERY situation in EVERY contested zone I just have to assume did not play on PVP servers in vanilla.
---
Spirit of Aquementas from Un'goro until you can get SW Drakestone.
---
Da faq is this? Duo ganking, y'all deserved to die.  
---
Need to roll rogue and stunlock forever like a real pvp pro. /s
---
There should be a guide on classic wowhead for everyone. Here's the prot warrior one, it has a few alternatives suggested for each slot.Just about the only thing I disagree with is their exclusion of the Naglering, but that's pretty minor.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
&gt; taking two days to respond to one of her messages
---
I mean, jesus christ lol
---
&gt; There's no reality in which you would find an indivisible million dollars.
---
Make it a lamborghini, it doesn't change anything.
---
&gt;BoEs are not gold or money, nor are they net worth, nor do they go to the person with the "lowest networth".
---
They go to whoever "needs" it by the other system
---
Basics economics. If the demand is high and supply doesn‚Äôt match, good on them for getting what they can. In retail, the game gives them special rewards for being needed. In classic, that‚Äôs up to the players, which is what we asked for.
---
I didn't even realise till week 2. That's the power of WoW.
---
cool awesome! so according to the comments, it does stack with Renew and it also gets +Heal. So triple awesome for the (8) set bonus :D
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of icyveins for all classes
---
According to my addon, I've farmed 50 essences of earth, so I'm going to go with the fact that you were unlucky rather than me being lucky.
---
Nobody tell him how awful that sword is.
---
Excited that I got staff of Jordan.
---
Mad that I can't sell it.
---
Wow, their realms were really small... If there's that much difference, I do wonder how much community (beyond guilds) will prosper permanently after layering is gone...
---
Oh there is nothing in place except community accountability. Sucks but if you blast someone who clearly ninja loots hopefully the community will do something.
---
also imgur is blocked at work now, so RIP
---
That's the point.  There already is a threshold.  Will you wear it?  Need.  Will you sell it?  Greed.
---
Simple, logical, easy to understand.  It's the *literal* definition of "greed".  Why introduce arbitrary cutoffs and subjective opinions into the matter?
---
I‚Äôm a zug zug myself but this is a great comment. 
---
I like the idea of a dichotomy like Batman and Joker. They hate but need each other, an abusive relationship. I love to hate alliance but would have no satisfaction in killing them if they didn‚Äôt hate me back. 
---
Blood and Thunder
---
I guarantee you that 90% of those groups advertising reserved slots aren't filling up. That's why you see them advertising constantly. The groups that don't fill up immediately. Or are looking for tanks. So start your own group. If you don't want to pay a tank a small fraction of the gold you make from that run, be prepared to wait awhile.
---
Honestly, you're the one with the shitty attitude. I think it's hilariously selfish of you to say, basically, "fuck them and their high repair bills. I want ALL my gold, I don't care if they get less, THAT'S WHAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR! They're just greedy fucks if they want to be compensated in any way for their time!"
---
Whatever you say, man. Whatever you say.
---
You'll find that on this subreddit people are incapable of thinking beyond the reddit bubble and when you try to talk to them about they just froth at the mouth as is found here.
---
The threads in this sub have shown the exact opposite of your experiences (example: guy that reported an exploiter in gadgetzan but the reporter got the warning) ... McDonald and Walmart workers live in Irvine, CA aswell, how come they dont earn a living wage?
---
Well done. I'm a truck driver who does cross country and I whip out my gaming laptop at truckstops and get a lot of attention. Let me know if you ever play on incendius.
---
Congrats and welcome to WoW :) if I can make a friendly suggestion which would help you out A TON, I would suggest for you to keybind each action bar to most letters on your keyboard, maybe except the important keys like O, X, Z, M and a few others. You won't regret it.
---
You see, in TBC my friend used to tell me to keybind my abilities because I'd play much better than clicking and so I did try it out, and I hated it for a few days until I got used to it. 
---
If you have a mouse with at least two side buttons, you can even keybind them to strafe left/right, and then keybind important abilities to Q/W/E. The best way to bind is to think of what key is most accessible for the important abilities such as interrupt. I have my tab as interrupt, always, and my \` key (next to 1) to tab target the nearest enemies.
---
Chad
---
The expensive part of crafting it is also a drop from MC (ingots). Is your guild going to provide you those ingots, or make you buy them?
---
I always put my first 5 points into anticipation to make same level questing smoother. Anymore is tough to justify though.
---
As an undead I don't even have a dick! Mah dick fell off
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen some pretty crazy stun locking stuff. Seems a lot of their kit is detailed for pvp. I still love the crazy burst damage in pve though. If changing from normal servers to pvp was allowed, I think I would. But alas I‚Äôll just wait for BG‚Äôs for now and roll any future character on pvp
---
Why is it good for mages? Do they have a life tap I wasnt aware of?
---
I haven't tried it since I just use the left window, but I believe you just make a tab in the left, undock it, move the undocked tab toward the right window, and you should be able to dock it to that one. I think there'll be a glow next to the existing tab to show you'll be docking it there.
---
I'd rather not have your potions if you're going to tell me what to do with them ;)
---
I thought we wanted Daisy's pants down.
---
yeah it is! i was just randomly running through badlands on my way to a quest when we saw each other. stopped. had a little convo that this was a snitbit of, and off we went until we meet next time. its what i remembered about vanilla and what i hoped for when i started playing classic :D
---
&gt; You just looking for people to tell you it's ok to ninja expensive items?
---
if 5 people roll need are we all ninjas?
---
You‚Äôre lucky.  You‚Äôre running into bad locks.  A lock with voidwalker sacrifice, that can summon it another time is pretty much unkillable in a 1v1 situation.  Even a 2v1 isn‚Äôt a guarantee vs a good lock.
---
But how can we subscribe... without a youtube channel?
---
well you need to keep farming those then. Earth are still double the price of air and water on my server last I checked a few days ago. Thats 1k gold alone from earth.
---
not for pvp genius.
---
In the group the Druid was in apparently 4/5 people agreed all-need is the best way to do it. And everyone needed. Seems fair to me.
---
it caps after two weeks I believe
---
That actually might not be entirely true. I haven't tested this myself yet, but I've read that in Classic you can create a macro that cancels bear form, uses a consumable, and then puts you back into bear form. Since none of these actions share a GCD it happens instantly and you don't take any additional damage from not being in bear form. I've been meaning to try it for a while but I keep forgetting to make the macro.
---
My understanding is that this didn't work on private servers but it does work in Classic. I don't know why it would be different, it's just what I read, either in a guide somewhere or on the druid discord maybe.
---
Then downvote it and be on your way. Some people care.
---
Shit mods making shit decisions, can't say I'm surprised
---
there's always a fat tauren standing inside him
---
Ya the problem is hurricane doesn't finish mobs off. So after it's done they are at like half HP and you have no good options. Swipe hits 3 targets and moonfire is doodoo for mana to damage. 
---
Would have be awesome if hurricane didn't have a cooldown. Moonkin would have been a viable way to AOE level. Oh well.
---
The server population is so much bigger than vanilla so it reduces the incentive to not be a jerk. That said, when I make my dungeon groups of MC pugs, there's probably gonna be a few people who are surprised they're on my ignore list.
---
Holy shit. Dont be sorry, that was beautiful.
---
&gt; Seems like you don‚Äôt know what meta stands for.
---
Seems like you don't know that meta has always been an abbreviation for *metagaming* rather than an acronym.
---
Only 2 hours?
---
Thanks for sharing! Good stuff!
---
what are they crimes btw ? i just kill what people point me at
---
you motherfucker, even caught me with the Skyrim meme.
---
I can't be mad. Take your upvote.
---
Maybe you can design a new group loot option, a third option called "I needed it more then the guy that rolled need"  lol
---
You're describe modern wow's token gear system because you don't want to risk not getting an award every dungeon run. I don't think classic is the right game for this mentality.
---
good editing skills my man keep it up was a funny video!
---
Fortunately, the Alliance that are remaining on Stalagg - and there's a lot of them - tend to be good at the game and very helpful. If the server transfers had any positive, it's that it got rid of a lot of bad players. The random dungeon groups I've joined and people I've met on Stalagg have been great. I transfered a level 50 to Heartseeker and it's the complete opposite. Heartseeker is full of toxic and bad players who ran away from other servers.
---
Zf is must run
---
I Beat this, got 2 arcane crystals and a blue sapphire from 1 node
---
This is 100% doable while leveling an NE Priest because of Sharshards. Yes, it's not the best spell and a channeled one at that. Holy Fire into Starshards allows MP5 to begin between casts. With a bunch of Spirit and some lucky Spirit Taps. I rarely ever go OOM while doing anything. I'm 30 ATM and have no problems in Dungeons being Heals or DPS
---
Sure, OK.
---
So roll on a new more balanced server. Problem solved.
---
So so. PvP servers are where Horde assholes go and "RP" killing every alliance they see. (There are also plenty on Alliance)
---
If you don‚Äôt think drain tanking is mana efficient I feel like you may have done it wrong.
---
Weaving life tap and dark part in to keep your life &lt;100% and your pets mana &lt;100% you should end a fight at almost full health and mana.
---
Unless he was the healer that's kinda messed up. Unless he told you before hand he would be rolling on healing gear
---
This video about Druid macros will help you out, but know that there is a known issue currently where swapping forms in one GCD will cause you to lose the crit from Sharpened Claws talent, and also Leader of the Pack will be removed from you and your party. This can be avoided by swapping into another form again, or swapping into caster form first. Hopefully this defect gets resolved soon!
---
https://youtu.be/uEFE3UGAwEs
---
I dont disagree with that but even with the mana cost it is still better for leveling up then getting 21 points into resto.
---
Won't a backstab have the same effect?
---
I absolutely agree.
---
It's also considered polite to talk to someone before opening trade
---
\*cries in mage\*
---
Please dude, I had some little bitch one shot me from 5% then had a horde buddy pm me his smack talk when I came back and killed him. There are assholes on both sides and thinking otherwise makes you an idiot
---
I understand that you find the meme distasteful. That is perfectly understandable. I've seen you comment on a few comments now though and I'm not sure what the point is. These commentators didn't make the meme, they're just commenting on the WoW portion. I understand you may be angry and/or disgusted, but I think that is something you should take up with the guy who posted it or the Mods if it comes to that. No hate man, just my two cents.
---
Every item that's not a quest item has a gold value, therefore everybody should have the opportunity to receive that gold value if they put in the effort to make the item drop. So as a holy priest I should definitely need on that Ironfoe because I need gold for my mount. Oh and that Dalrends is like 7 g too so when I run ubrs I make sure to need on it case I need gold for my mount.
---
How does that happen though? Doesn't the game just give it to whoever won? Sorry I'm just confused üò¨
---
Whom‚Äôst‚Äôd‚Äôve Rexxar?
---
I think a moonkin would be a good fit for a spellcleave group
---
I don't remember this happening back in the day.  I remember the paladin saying we should find a druid tank and not invite any arms warriors though.
---
I kinda can i think that if i spam alt-tab it will dissmount
---
Lol just trying to offer practical help here bud. But since I can see you're not open to that, I'll take your salt and put it on my fries.
---
I feel you on the adult with responsibilities front! Having young kids and responsibility means I'll probably not be able to ever run the longer dungeons and I'll definitely never have blocks of time big enough for raiding like when I was a teenager and the game was new. Despite those being the best parts of the game for me I'm still having fun with it regardless!
---
19 days played, total of 52 crystals and 14 lotus farmed on a full realm.
---
You need to pick a better spot mate.
---
How necessary is pre-raid BIS gear and enchants for raiding? I would think getting 2-3 pieces is always suggested, but is getting a full BIS going to be required by some guilds/pugs (I'd consider that overboard tbh). As I understood MC was cleared by random greens and blues back in the day so I would hope having just a few pieces of BIS is sufficient.
---
Found the mage
---
It's not hard to say "Hey, mind if we group up?"
---
Had an encounter like that in Desolace. I, undead rogue, was doing some honest farming and a human warrior decided to charge me underwater. Gouged into an Blind and continued doing what I was doing. He lived with probably 10hp and I never saw him again.
---
That's not exactly true. While they aren't directly linked, Blizzard did say they were increasing the pop cap on some servers, and they're already far above vanilla limits. Presumably they will be forced to lower the limits when they eliminate layering, thus forcing more people into queue.
---
If Kromcrush,  we had a raid group of 20-30 alliance camping various choke points of Blackrock Mountain spawn camping 50-53s to death. After that, I vowed every fucking alliance, grey or not, will pay for that shit. 
---
Red = Dead.
---
Dont you still roll on non common items with ffa turned on?
---
Mandela Effect is one you move from one layer to another without realizing it.
---
As a fellow Invoker player, that guy is the reason I am able to keep up with so many binds now I think.
---
this was me
---
now all gnomes will perish
---
Almost no one is going to blacklist you for one mistake like setting your pet on agro. No reasonable person would do that. 
---
Now, you will get kicked from groups or guilds for consistently underperforming. You may fail a trial to get into a guild because of a few mistakes. But even hardcore raiders make mistakes. I was once a hardcore raider before TBC was released. Not world first by any means but a world 50 or so guild. I made mistakes. I caused wipes. But my mistakes were rare. 
---
And causing a wipe in a 5 man due to a mistake is not as big a deal as causing a wipe in a 40 man raid. I mean, I caused a BRD wipe on my warlock for a run we had farmed several times due to being sleepy and silly. I admitted fault and the group took it in stride. Now, if I kept wiping them or kept making mistakes, I would have been kicked. 
---
Now certain behavior will get you blacklisted. But these have more to do with attitude and behavior. And incompetence can get you blacklisted. But one mistake is generally forgiven. We all make mistakes. And more reasonable players will understand that occasional mistakes happen.
---
&gt;Gold is in need by everyone.
---
That's literally greed and with that logic, everyone should just need everything cause even a BOP will often vendor for more than a gold.
---
I do the exact opposite.  Heal main and  take ret stuff for questing if no one else needs
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
My point is that you can do everything right and still get shit on.  It's going to happen all the time, not just in WoW, but IRL too.  All you can do is feel good about the decisions you have made and use that information to protect yourself in the future.
---
Can't even use them if you select a different target
---
#/stare
---
Are mages dropping tailoring after they craft their robe? Is it really worth leveling again for ZG cloth robes?
---
If you did this, what profession did you choose to replace tailoring?
---
They‚Äôve been fighting forever. It‚Äôs definitely believable that two races are still fighting each other in a fantasy game.
---
Not sure what you mean, doesn't it carry over to the next level and increases at a steady rate?
---
Yeah I'm on one of the busiest but every so often you meet a few folks and they tend to stick to you like glue lol.  It's how I joined my guild.
---
Nope
---
Looks like you don't have anything to say either *deleted comment* dumbass! üòÜ
---
&gt; You guys are bringing a logic from left field saying you will need it, then sell it to give you the g to buy what you need so now you're saying F U to the rest of the group.
---
We'll its different to compare raid drops to dungeon drops because one is pimarily master looted to the rest of the raid so /rolling on BOEs is fundamentally different from pressing Need in a dungeon.
---
Its not about saying "Fuck you" to the rest of the group, I'm encouraging everyone in my group to press Need with me. Everyone should have a fair shot at the chance of getting some loot.
---
&gt;But at this point, after the WoW rules have been established for 15+, you are going to look like an asshole the whole time.
---
This is ironic because on Retail the rules of loot have disappeared, and about 99% of the people playing classic also haven't played private servers so the "15 years of established loot rules" haven't actually existed for most people here. 
---
&gt;Which brings me to my next point, is it that serious that you need to need on every single item 40g+? (The answer is no btw)
---
The answer is yes, an epic mount costs 900gold and if you're a raider you need to buy pots every week, the answer is so obvious i'm actually shocked you said that you don't need 40 gold when it shows up.
---
I think that its fair to assume that everyone in the group is rightfully deserving of 40 gold rather than only 1 person simply because "I can equip it".
---
Anyone in the group can sell that item for its value and purchase something of equal value and equip it within 5 min. Everyone can use the dropped item of value regardless of if they can put it on their character on the spot or not.
---
I recalled hating gnomer 13 years ago, but I wasn't really sure why.  I ran it one time this go around.  I remember why I hated gnomer.   It'll be another 15 years for the re-classic release before I forget and run it again.
---
its a fuckton of life? do you all have no idea how to gear for pvp?
---
Hunter is fine in the first raid tier and maybe 2nd/3rd.  It's mostly that the pet damage doesn't scale with gear and pets take damage.  Basically, we start strong in the early raid tiers, then fade a bit in the later tiers.
---
I mean how else do you get to Orgrimmar? 
---
Also only if they're flagged, mate.
---
For attention
---
Papa bless. 34 rogue named zalbag and 29 war named status. I took the week off when classic launched but I only got to level 19 with a friend because he was in the process of moving and I helped. I usually try to play 1 day a week and I go super hard for 12 hours.
---
Explain how rogues can avoid any gank in p2?
---
Ah I was replying to the wrong comment. Classic wow community needs to learn some patience.
---
Well devilsaur leather is a crap shoot too, with even more RNG imo.
---
I've tried the herbing thing and even with an epic mount I find essence farming to be better gph atm.
---
Haven't tried felcloth so I can't comment on that one.
---
Because it's a dick move.
---
If you want your loot reserved, advertise in chat that that's what you want and you'll get invites from groups who are cool with that, or start your own group advertising that. Whispering groups desperately looking for a tank that you demand this or you won't join them is a dick move and leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth.
---
You can make decent progress with 1 month and from there you can decide if you want to resub for longer.
---
How do you enforce NOT enforcing a meta?
---
Since I play WoW on my toaster oven, I use the temperature knob to turn left and right.
---
Jeez, that's nuts! That's such a small amount of players... Sounds like it was a bit too low maybe! XD
---
Honestly this is amazing. I‚Äôve been a horde player since I started playing in BC and this is so satisfying. They made a dick move
---
&gt; There is no auction house where you can sell a found Lamborghini in your city
---
You know people sell cars at auction right?
---
If I find an abandoned Lamborghini you can claim it after a certain amount of time.
---
Thats your threshold, not mine and the players I play with definition.
---
Rogues are great for world PvP. You might have a bit of a harder time while leveling since Combat is the fastest build but lacks many of the PvP perks. BGs won't be in for awhile but Rogues should be fine when they are added.
---
&gt;do people genuinely get a kick out of tormenting a low level quester
---
That is the primary reason most PvP players play on a PvP server. They get their enjoyment by ruining the enjoyment of other players.
---
No. You can start the imp quest from the trainer there, but they will send you back to orcville.
---
What's your action bar add-on

Was camped by a 60 shaman at level 40 in arathi for a good hour. I too also camped hillsbrad for an hour.
---
This post gave me such SatansHeteroFather vibes. Love it!
---
&gt; the conversation is being repeated over and over..
---
the general consensus is pretty clear
---
Either this is a contentious conversation or there's a general consensus, not both.
---
Yea you have to use charge for that opener to work. Its not really for an LoS pull. It shouldnt take much longer than 2 gcds.
---
I'll keep em coming mate :D
---
That could be considered a bug.  You should report it.
---
Witch hunting only applies if theres no proof or evidence.
---
I remember wiping in SM LB because our tank kept pulling without waiting for our priest to drink. He kept telling us to let him know when we were low on mana but dude just pay attention to our mana bars too.
---
Easy to avoid, "LF Tank for guild run of UBRS.  Trying to gear our OT, carapace and shield on reserve".   It doesn't get around the dalrends though. Because what would you be really trying to gear up on?
---
They probably could have 9 manned at with an OT as MT
---
Yep, exactly.
---
Nah I agree with you, don't support those gold sellers, they are a cancer to the game. I hate getting those random whispers and channel invites like "WTS GOLD AT GOLDSELLERXX.COM"
---
Oh damn yeah that's not good haha. 
---
I wish there was a way to see crit chance and whatnot in the character screen.
---
How is it selfish to roll need on a BoE? Each party member can sell it and buy their own BiS. Everyone gets the same value from the drop so either everyone should roll greed or everyone should roll need; if some people feel like passing that‚Äôs a nice thing to do but not at all required.
---
You know this is directly in front of org right?
---
How is Devilsaur RNG? Literally go to Un'Goro during nighttime and get as much as you want. Or go during daytime and swap layers. On my server, even though it's high pop during daytime, I can randomly come across Devilsaurs.
---
Your arguments are as flimsy as paper. People play what they like to play. If the majority play the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù so fuckin what? It‚Äôs what they like to play. Just because you don‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else shouldn‚Äôt either.
---
Haha, I had to get that meme in some where
---
Youre sleeping on the drain tank dark pact meta my man

Love bro

AtlasQuest Classic

Is there an addon that can help you track combat statistics to test and compare different gear loadouts?  For example it can tell you it took 45 second to kill the mob with weapon  A and you took 80% max hp and then you can compare it to another weapon B that took you 90 seconds but you took 40% max health.  This would be super useful, thanks.
---
Nobody is twinking yet. Wait until BG are released and all that stuff will shoot up in price. Well that's what I'm hoping anyway.
---
I am playing horde and literally never do this, some players like to attack me, especially when I'm low and fighting mobs (dude you already 6 lvls higher, why?) and had experience like that with every class except paladin
---
Download uhhh 'deja classic stats' addon
---
I'm guessing you're the dive from the PDF that I just read, thanks and dog bless. I'll be switching over to that as soon as I get home! I'm excited.
---
Pls no killerino
---
Did the same, ran NE hunter to Dun Morogh, got level 10 and the trainer sent me back to Darnassus for the pet quest.
---
It's all part of the experience! This is good game design!
---
Thogg got 3 female orcs that night.
---
Hello Free Action Potion and other consumables
---
Thank you! Sold it for 5g before I realised it was 2 days cd rather than 1. Thought I may be underselling a bit.
---
Top notch; I laughed way too hard.  Did I hear a Daequan "BOP" in there too?  :)
---
As for the first issue, so far it seems to work fine for me.
---
I‚Äôll try the second thing you said. Thanks!
---
Bitchin'
---
I guess it didn‚Äôt word my post right. I was suggesting he strafe with a and d and completely remove keyboard turning keys.
---
What? The real vanilla experience was way less accepting that classic. Nobody would let you play with them if you were a sub-optimal spec
---
I'm sure some groups will require it, but it's not necessary. The important thing is that you're pulling your weight, or at least not too far below the bell curve. Tanks will probably need the most gear and healers the least.
---
I've been super lazy setting up addons but I found that Titan Panel of all things can scale my entire UI to a much smaller/cleaner size
---
My favorite system ever was a council, but it definitely suffered from an "oh no, after *you*" loop.
---
Some piece of gear would drop, 5 people join its loot channel, but then we'd get 3 "aye &lt;link current piece, date of last loot&gt;" before somebody said "pass" and the floodgates opened.
---
After a minute or so of "I'm fine waiting" and "don't really need it that much" the officer in charge of the channel would ask again who needed &lt;item.&gt;
---
... *crickets* ....
---
Eventually we just started forcing everybody in the channel to roll when that happened. :)
---
I don't know why I have such a strong aversion to any video with thumbnail art edited like that.
---
https://youtu.be/UScjKHNhh0w here you go mate :D thank you
---
What did you guys kill? Just some lowbies and guards ??
---
I feel like this sub is starting to turn into people complaining about everything and then people complaining about people complaining.
---
Kurrinax AH is stabilizing. Lots of basic mats are worth selling now. BoE greens are still in the toilet unless they are rocking tits, but those can just be censored or mail to an alt for DE.
---
I  do wish it was extended to 30 yds.
---
30-40 is the hardest slog for leveling. Once you reach the early 40's, Tanaris, Feralas and other zones open up that are ripe and juicy.
---
A few hours? More like a week.
---
You can use consumables, I can use consumables. How exactly does this give you an advantage?
---
roll mage - sheep hunter / kill pet - run away. Rinse and Repeat. This is Vanilla Tactics.
---
no you werent lol
---
Sounds like bullshit
---
I don't know, I did dungeon grind for the first time ever and it was a lot more fun than I expected. It's also pretty efficient (56-60 in 12h as warrior for ex).
---
&gt;Don't act like your high repair bill gives you the right to other people's gold when you have benefits that others don't
---
I don't play a tank in classic at all, but alright guy.
---
I don't think those tanks think they are *entitled* to anything. I don't think any of them will get mad at you for rejecting their offer of tanking for tips. But you are also not *entitled* to have them tank for you for free, and I think you're kind of tripping up on that point.
---
You seem like the kind of person who has very strong opinions about how things should be done, and anything else is completely unacceptable. Even in the face of numerous people here disagreeing with you, you simply continue to rant and insist we're all wrong and loot reserves are 100% unacceptable.
---
Even in the face of me telling you that this was always part of vanilla, if only less so, you continue to rave about classic community and how they all suck now.
---
I still say you're the one with the shit attitude.
---
a few pieces will be sufficient for most non-hardcore groups, I expect, but you'll probably want to make sure you're at least wearing level appropriate greens at that point and not some stuff you never replaced since level 20 :)
---
&gt; As a tank/healer you are playing your role just like everyone else. 
---
But their roles are quite a bit harder.  They can't just spam frostbolt, they have to juggle a lot more logistics, and factor a lot more in.
---
Thanks for the F-shack.
---
Signed Thogg and his healer.
---
If people are completing 40 man raids with 24 people, why would anyone complain about bringing 3 shadow priests so long as you have enough healers?
---
Meh, couple of ours fishing for stonescale eels made up for the missing 50 at lvl 35
---
Money isn't as hard as people make it look (though definitely harder than in bfa)
---
lmao i stopped reading when the PL said "shitpost" hahahaah
---
lol, the fake concern.
---
I now see you were fishing for someone to say warlock.
---
I was going to say warlock anyway.
---
Start saving at 30, aka - don't buy anything except for flights and repairs. and You should have about 100 at 40.
---
Yeah just admit it might have been your fault and move on, even if it wasnt.   Next res, be better.   If the same shit happens next time and it still wasn't your fault,  then people will see whose fault it was.   Not worth arguing about at all.   You're all at fault here because you all bickered about in incidental moment.   Move on and be better next time.
---
"Has anyone seen Rexxar?"
---
(My answer, always)
---
"Yeah, he's an orc. About 6'5", brown skin, wears a wolf mask"
---
&gt;How is Devilsaur RNG?
---
Well finding them first of all. Secondly making sure not to get ganked/ninja'd if you do find them.
---
I appreciate all the memes in this post. It was edited beautifully.
---
This is exactly how the violence perpetuates. The number of alliance terrorists my level grp is creating. I am sorry for those 10 levels under us.
---
I would feel fine because all-need on BoE epics is the logical and safe way to go 100% of the time. People get emotional when they see the purple they want show up in the loot box right in front of them but the reality is that a BoE epic provides the same value to whoever loots it. Either everyone should greed or everyone should need.
---
If shit doesnt work out with your boyfriend, hit me up. My girlfriend could care less about WoW.
---
Okay
---
Oh my bad, yes, that's the way to do it!
---
WS? Do you mean WC as in Wailing Caverns, and taming elites from there? Should be able to, though I'm not sure why you'd want to. I think you can get the same looks from other places.
---
If you‚Äôre unsure, just ask. There is a lot of game knowledge that goes into knowing what gear is ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù most by each class. 
---
When I‚Äôm unsure I‚Äôll gear check other players to see if it is a bigger upgrade for them than it is for me.
---
Cry harder
---
Not gonna lie my wife commented on the 3 week dry spell.
---
This is so dumb... skinning literally makes you pennies until you hit 40 and start skinning thick leather regularly. After that is where the real money comes in. If you are dropping skinning when you get to 40 why did you even bother picking it up in the first place?
---
Technically they didn't do anything wrong, they just used a dirty way to get people in raid, where a lot of people probably won't care since they don't want to have to find a new pug. They don't need to technically say anything about the loot rules if noone asked. It's one reason I always ask if anything if on reserve.
---
"LFM MC Need dps 8PM server time" doesn't imply anything with loot. They don't mention it so they can get people to assume is MS&gt;OS, then when the full group is at the raid they announce it.
---
He was a lvl 33 warrior. You could've killed him at full hp lmao
---
Good decision. A game wonÀãt improve your situation, so focus your energy on productive things. I am doing the same
---
Thanks for reminding me to do that, duh
---
Well if there's a part to your analogy that isn't important, it's a bad analogy. It's also indicative that you could talk about the base discussion without using the analogies. I'm glad you're enjoying yourself, but just because you're lazy and disinterested doesn't make your argument any more correct.
---
Raids penalize xp plus you're splitting it a lot more ways.  Its not a viable xp farming strategy.
---
By the time you're in MC you're not supposed to care about xp anymore.
---
I agree with you. Without consumables and/or private heal warrior is one if not the worst class open pvp and 1v1
---
&gt; If the tangible increase in power from equipping is worth more to you than 1000g, you should rationally have already bought it on the AH, or you‚Äôre already saving up so you can.
---
&gt; Otherwise the 1000g is more valuable to you than the increase in power and if you win the roll you should rationally sell it.
---
The mental gymnastics here is astounding, as if everyone has the time and ability to magically save up/spend 1000g whenever they want.
---
Maybe you should just use Greed if you want Gold, and Need if you'll use the item... If only there was an existing system for that...
---
That must be why you all have no balls and need to gank during a mob fight. /s
---
Since when is UBRS a raid? It‚Äôs a 5 man...
---
As a fellow goon that refused to play on Herod due to wait times and an overload of try hard guilds, I  grieve for my brother's loss
---
The caster should have to type out the spell incantation for every cast ‚Äú/say expelliarmus!‚Äù
---
&gt;Same with disenchanting, i may neet so enchanting mats but that‚Äôs not the same in any way as needing it as a better gear
---
There was actually a thread some time ago about some guy needing on all greens to DE. I can't even, lol.
---
I saw a few others recommending SM Cath too, Why Cath?
---
White rice..I used to eat it with a little butter and seasons about...4 days a week when I was struggling. If we were able to afford meat that week it was like a very small amount, maybe enough for a 1lb or 2 and that was for 2 people for the week.
---
any update on this?
---
Yeah, but that would require thought.
---
Don't worry, at 40 you can do the scarlet monastery and the rfd one and you get two sweet swords for free
---
But not me.
---
1. [TellMeWhen](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tellmewhen/files/2788615) or set something up in [WeakAuras2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files/2796809).
---
2. So there [used](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mbb) to be a great addon for this. If you want to sift through the comments it looks like you might still be able to get it to work. Alternately, each addon should have the ability to disable its minimap button.
---
3. [SexyMap](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sexymap). It's a bit more feature rich than I need, but some of the other options I've tried gave me issues. Also this addon can help you out with your second issue a bit too.
---
Anyone got an archive link to that deleted thread?
---
I wouldn't expect everybody in the world to know it would be me on the picture, and not just some random stock photo. So no. People are making thousands if not millions of memes and jokes about terrible events and to some extent it's people's way of coping with the shitty things in the world. I'm fine with it. 
---
Also, this is not a joke. It's explaining the feeling of losing something you have dear. In this case, Shadow Form. It's a meme.
---
Enters org. Dies. ‚ÄúFor the alliance‚Äù
---
It does, but 20 int for your group still isn‚Äôt worth losing a bunch of spell damage. And to clarify, it only affects your party, not everyone.
---
It‚Äôs usually not worth taking a boomkin and their buff is leagues better than this one.
---
I used to use regrowth but I was oom too much.  
---
Now I use rejuvenation at first and wait. Then HT as needed when tank us low. 
---
I have been farming the AH for + healing gear and it helps so much.  At level 39 i have +186 healing and it has doubled the potency of my lower spells. Worth it.
---
Dude right? 
---
Need if you need. Don't need if you don't need it. Greed then. 
---
I go a lil extra and ask if anyone needs the greens from chest rolls I win. Best way to get good friends and rep.
---
Yes they do. It's a PvP server, now move along.
---
So like Midgar? Just build another city on top of the old one.
---
Yes and yes.
---
I don't get it either. In my personal experience, which is obviously not 100% representative, Every single group has instantly agreed with little to no discussion to all roll need on BoE's blue and up. I have not seen a single person object in game.
---
then u waste ppls time by making them going to the raid only for them to hear that they cant get the item they need. shame.
---
What happens when a Mage polymorphs you on the free action potion?
---
That's lying by omission. Still scamming, still against the rules and reportable.
---
When I get a group I am up front about being shadow specced.  Really this makes very little difference, but I say it does.  Something like, throughput will be fine, but im going to need to drink.  Then I buff everyone and drink up.  Then I drink the first time I get close to 50% and say something like, if you see me over 50% and it's a normal pull, go ahead. i'll keep drinking and top you off when I have enough.
---
It builds in the idea to be watching your mana and to be mindful of pulls.  
---
Also, no one wants to run back.  so if they know you are going to be drinking back up, they take more care.
---
Also, since Im shadow, I ask people to let me kill the runners if they arent dangerous.  Like if they are running behind us.  THen I get spirit tap and wait.  It is hard when they just want to go go og go go, but I find setting up the mentality of "my mana matters", they start to pay attention.
---
Good luck!
---
I'm reducing the argument to absurdity, the value of the item is always the reason for given by "needers" when they say need on BoE, but the truth is by the time you see a BoE epic you've seen vendor value equal or greater in BoP drops, so if gold value is the reason that everyone is supposed to need then every thing should be a need roll because it doesn't matter if somebody can equip it or not it's only value to the needer is the gold. 
---
In other words the only value a BoE epic has to somebody pressing need is how much much gold that person can sell it for... Which is the inherent definition of greed.
---
I am getting secondhand rage at this story.
---
In World PvP, druid dominates, in 1v1, shadow priest/SL warlock dominate, in BGs, druids dominate WSG and AB, AV is dominated by frost mages/resto shamans.
---
Now this is the kind of quality content I come here for.
---
Thank you too :)
---
Heh you died
---
Nevermind that I have died scores of times, you died and posted it in a video
---
Ninja looting is changing to Master Looter at the last minute and taking all the drops.
---
Everything else is just bullshit that people make up because they feel entitled to purples or gold.
---
MOR WERK?!
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
Directions unclear, currently specc'd 16/17/17, send help...
---
Warlock.
---
Might be reddit hyperbole I must admit. However a level 60 rogue will probably be ganked once when flying into Burning Steppes. Or he rides from Rredridge on his mount and can stealth into the mountain.   
---
There might be some flares up at the entrance, but compare that to a level 56 tauren prot warrior in the searing gorge on his 60% mount. It will be a shit show. 
---
It will be less so for a rogue.
---
Okay so I was using Succubus I‚Äôd Corruption CoA it gets aggro I immolate tap drain life until death but I keep lash and invis on auto you‚Äôre saying to not put them on auto and not even use lash of pain, or like switch to imp entirely ?
---
A black lotus is a free win if drawn, its an upgrade.
---
they're not friends, its 4 random people.
---
He was a healing rogue; he bandages!
---
It‚Äôs all because white European males horded them all I thought?
---
Stealth.
---
It's definitely one of the best raids. Now granted I don't have experience from raids after Cataclysm other than LFR but Firelands was really nice.
---
Just stop buying shit, including spell upgrades you don't strictly need. Everybody would have enough gold from questing and selling items (either to vendor or the AH) they collect if they just didn't spend their money all the time.
---
I always give water if people ask respectfully. I ignore them if they're rude or demand it. Just "water pls?" or something.
---
A little kindness goes a long way.
---
Im Talking about people who sell so low that no one profits even a single copper from it bc they have no clue
---
D: why
---
Is it still worth following the guide?
---
Attacking literally anything as sword combat spec?
---
That's just asking to get killed.
---
Dumb logic. Need is if you need the item, greed is if you don't need and want to sell. The directions are literally right there in front of you.
---
u/shinghand 2020
---
I play Horde but vote Hillsbrad.  When I was there as a Horde there were a ton of alliance.  I also got a few levels there realtively quickly
---
Yea it didnt hit me. Shitty use of a photo for a meme.
---
Please don't ever stop making content. I nearly died laughing.
---
&gt;If you want to play a tank for the rewards, you're an entitled dick
---
Don't think anyone is leveling a tank to 60 *just* to charge people for runs. It's a byproduct of being someone who actually levels a tank to 60, because obviously, a lot of people don't want to. (Big fucking hint: there's a reason for that, and you're part of it.)
---
Also, it seems like me and plenty of other people are of the opinion that that does not, in fact, make you a dick.
---
Reason 1-100: You/The group/The group leader can just say no if you don't agree to the terms.
---
No hurt feelings necessary. You just have to use your words.
---
I would consider this part of community interaction.
---
I'm 39 druid so I'm pretty similar in level to you.  I am also going the HOTW/NS route.  I like to keep a feral set and also a healing set. 
---
I used to cast the down ranked healing spells until I read that down ranking isn't really mana efficient until you have some +healing gear.  So now I just wait until tank loses enough health for a regrowth to fully heal them, then  let the HOT from regrowth continue healing him for the rest of the fight.  This way I'm not casting as often and so it gives my mana time to regen during fights.
---
It's not against the rules though. Its on loot master, who decides how loot is distributed. It is 100% shady and lying by omission to get a group formed.
---
And then Saurfang cleaved and it was all over
---
I‚Äôm quite sure you‚Äôre the one missing the point, as you‚Äôre disagreeing with your own statements... I still don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúsystems‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to, nor what rules you‚Äôre talking about. Blizzard hasn‚Äôt published any overall rules. 
---
And yes, what you‚Äôre talking about is called utilitarianism. But that‚Äôs not necessarily the right thing to do. Which is why, this exactly is an ethical problem. 
---
I have no interest in making rules. The rules differ from every guild/group/person playing this game.
---
From memory, /p puts a bubble over your head when you say something but no one else sees it. /S &amp; /y shows up for everyone within maybe 30 yards.
---
Again, this is from memory and I could be completely wrong. I like /oom too.
---
You could get banned
---
Well, while I can't say anything about sub numbers, I can confirm that on my server the average number of auctions up each day has gone down \~60% (from over 30k/scan to over 10k/scan).
---
Yup, this is the way it has always been. This subreddit is a bizarre place of level 20‚Äôs that spend more time here than actually playing the game
---
Dropped skinning at 60 and leveled tailoring. Bought a Robe of the archmage pattern for 80g. Made close to 100g selling runecloth bags. It basically paid for itself and the pattern. 10/10 would do it again.
---
Fuck you first of all. And second of all i dont think layers affect queued. You are still playing on the same server
---
Thing is, blizz thought about 20k would play in total so two realms with layers would be enough since 95% of everyone were supposed to quit after 5 days.
---
You‚Äôre only the 400th person to comment this. I‚Äôm not an idiot lol
---
I already have targeting keys and 7, 8, 9, 0 are actually buttons I‚Äôm pressing on my mouse. Plus I have keybinds for some of the stuff on my 2nd row but they don‚Äôt show up on screen. I love how everyone assumes that I‚Äôm actually clicking those keys on my keyboard, does nobody use a mouse with multiple buttons?
---
Got me with the bear attack part
---
Layers have nothing to do with server cap and won't impact queues. Layers will be removed before phase 2.
---
I'm convinced that the majority of players on this sub are people still in their 20s walking around taking screenshots of the sunset dreaming of rainbows and ponies.
---
No offense, they can do whatever they want in the game but the general opinion here is very very different to what I've actually experienced in game.
---
Yeah, you knowing something about the picture rather than it just being a gravestone for rest of us makes more sense for your side. To get your point across better would've been to make a separate comment stating what you know and why this is bad. But, it's probably not my 3rd or 5th meme I've seen with a graveyard/gravestone in them, hard to state commenters of memes as the bad guys.
---
mechanics aren‚Äôt hard, they nerfed numbers... that‚Äôs all.  That said it‚Äôs more fun in classic
---
Keep using barman's buddy. Shit dagger. There are so many better ones out there.
---
Recently in like three days ago. They didn't touch the males up too much, but did a lot of work on the females. If you didn't like them before you probably won't like them now.
---
yep, it's a bs tactic I've seen a lot. Which is why I always send a whisper asking whats on reserve.
---
Lol, did you copy/past this hoping it was some sort of conversation-ender?
---
The time a player has to commit to this game, their level of commitment, and the value you or they place on individual items is completely subjective. The line "either way, the value to you..." is such a hilariously biased assumption that this holds no merit to the conversation.
---
Try forming your own opinion.
---
We do alright in wPvP from what I've experienced. 
---
I would say don't go looking for trouble until you get vanish. Then make sure you always have reagents for that. 
---
The following is my personal opinion, and should be taken with a grain of salt.
---
Go combat swords until 30, then at 30 bite the bullet and respec to get Hemo.
---
You will lose some damage doing this, but it helps so much with wPvP.
---
You don't need to be resto until 60, even then you can heal 60 dungeons as a DPS spec as long as you have healing gear and are prepared to drink a bit more than you otherwise would.
---
As for healing in dungeons: #1 rule that many healers (especially those not familiar with classic) get wrong is that everyone needs to be topped off. Unless there is a very good reason to keep everyone at high health, try to maximize mana regen time by waiting until people are at around half health, then do some burst healing and then wait to regen.  Also mana spring totem is great, it pays back its mana cost very quickly and soon after becomes a net positive, especially if you have other mana users.
---
&gt;Plus what you're doing is severely out of touch. Which brings me to my next point, is it that serious that you need to need on every single item 40g+? (The answer is no btw)
---
This is what gets me the most. Is 40g on a random BOE really that make or break for these ninjas? I make more selling random fish and cloth. Just let the poor guy who just healed your ass for the past two hours get their upgrade.
---
Eh, that was his 4th attempt to calm the group down, you just skipped over the rest of it.
---
He holds right click so no need to change the keys. Right click turns a and d into strafe while also giving you camera control
---
Rose-Tinted Goggles? Lol
---
Need on things you need and can use.
---
If you can't use it yet you need to check with the group to make sure no one else needs before rolling.  If they need and can use it, you're underlevel and will run it again while they may need to move onto the next dungeon already.
---
Disenchant (sometimes).
---
I can't even tell anymore.
---
damn bro lol
---
Fire Resist Aura/Totem + Fire resist potions should be enough
---
anybody know if there‚Äôs a macro for drinking water? 
---
could be a macro for the action plus a message that announces you‚Äôre stopping for mana
---
&gt; Me, me, me, my time, me, me. What about the tank that tanks for you? And the other dps? The healer that heals the tank that tanks for you? Are you clearing 5 man content by yourself?? You are very shortsighted. Your entire text is a handbook to selfishness.
---
That's what we're talking about - what the mage does before the dungeon starts: making water. So yes, it is about me, lol. What you do *during* a dungeon is a completely different topic. Everyone has their jobs on every pull.
---
I also find it weird you seemed to skim over my entire chatter about how I primarily do AOE groups. I don't typically like running with a healer at all in fact, I want another mage. Best group is probably a prot pally + 4 mages for leveling.
---
&gt; Yes. Have you ever played a healer? Is healing wave free? You buff once every hour. I lay totems down every fight. Is chain heal free? Is cleansing poison and disease free? Is keeping the tank up and then also that other warr dps that keeps attacking a different target each time not mana consuming?
---
Yes. No. I buff every 30 minutes but thanks for paying attention. Chain heal is not free. Cleanse is not free. These are all things that occur during a dungeon, not prior to the dungeon. Everyone, well mostly everyone, brings their utility during a fight that you expect them to perform. I'm not expected to make water *during the fight* am I? What a weird tunnel to drag this argument down. "I put totems down so the mage should make water for me", honestly don't care if you put the totems down or not, you're getting slotted for another mage for better efficiency ;)
---
&gt; Yeah, I am a decent healer. I want you to go balls to the walls dps, I've got you.
---
lol, you've clearly never played a mage. We explode if anything touches us. I have like 900hp at 52 and shit hits me for 700 just last night in BRD. You aren't going ot have a chance to heal me. I ice block not to give you time to heal me, but to give me time to get another ice barrier/nova. Healing me literally does not matter, it will not keep me alive - which is why I entertain the thought experiment of paying for heals.
---
&gt; And then, after I flash heal the dick out of you, and we clean house, I'm going to take a moment to drink some of that sweet water you conjured for me, because we are a team and that shit was teamwork down to a T.
---
I'd rather just not get hit though and bring 3 or 4 more mages who also don't get hit and down the pull in 1 blizzard instead of 4. That's teamwork down to a T.
---
&gt; Again, not how WoW is played friend. This game is 15 years old, you're not discovering new shit. Honestly, if your time is so valuable even inside a game, what the fuck are you even playing it for? You should try a single player competitive game, but again, you do you magey friend. I'm done because you're getting pretty salty.
---
Sounds like you're salty, but I digress. Go play a single player competitive game? lol what does that even mean? I want to enjoy end game content I never got to enjoy in Vanilla, so yeah, time is important as I don't value this time leveling. Is that not how Wow is played, friend? News to me I guess. I get it that my preference of rushing through the leveling process and AOE grinding 1-60 is not in the majority and I don't want to force other people to play the game that way - but that's how I choose to play the game.
---
Again, you're also insinuating that rezzing someone is an expectation. That's a weird opinion to have considering most people here would say that it is considerate to at least start running back instead of just expecting the healer to rez you. In fact I read a post I believe even in this thread (probably from you lol) that a healer is mad he had to rez a mage and then drink and rez someone else and drink and the mage didn't want to give him water. Your arguments don't even make sense and are in general against the general population. If you ever find me in game, dont' bother rezzing me, I promise I wont' get mad. My spirit walk is my own damn fault for dying.
---
&gt; Even if you don't need healing yourself because your e-dick is so big, your tank does. Are you clearing 5 man content by yourself?
---
I actually did clear SM GY by myself waiting for my group once. I was not overleveled, only high enough to not get resisted every other cast. They were like WTF when they walked in and I was sitting there drinking at the FB. One guy was actually so mad he wanted me booted... it's like lets kill this guy for loot and reset? I've done most of armory/cath solo too waiting for groups in LFG.  Mage is really strong. When played properly, NPCs can't hit you. And like I've said now 3 or 4 times, the best group I've ever been in was 5 mages. Second best was 4 mages and a prot pally, so no we don't need you. Traditional groups are a drag and super slow, good for casual, no risk leveling while I'm watching a football game or something (i.e. last night).
---
So I guess you're wrong on every account. Thanks for coming and I'm glad we can both agree you don't need any water :)
---
Lol your 30-40 looks just like mine.
---
This has nothing to do with auction house addons. Lazy undercutters pricing to move will cause the price dips whether manually or using an addone with a stupid high undercut. 
---
High Supply of Item + Seller just wanting instant gold + Low Supply of Gold = low gold cost of item.
---
30s are super weird. You are going to be bouncing around to a bunch of different zones. If you don't mind add ons I would suggest getting Questie. It helps out so much.
---
a 1k wait today is 20-30k wait without layers
---
It's so endearing to me that there are so many completely new players running around genuinely enjoying themselves just as much, if not more than us veterans.

What is your spec? On the first 2 kills I see you spec hemo but not when you're fighting that orc.

Yup, this. Time in WoWClassic is precious, but looking at every activity as a time-waster is no way to enjoy the game. Sometimes a successful play-session is merely travelling from your questing zone back to a city, or the reverse. This week we (duo partner) spent 3 nights, separate 1.5 hours play-sessions, travelling to new flight paths to ultimately make a journey to Feralas so that she could be ready to raise herbalism when we hit 35. Some players would see this as a massive waste of time (the journey) to get one short thing (clicking a trainer), but for us that adventure very much is the game, and it's refreshing to have a game where several play-sessions are genuinely just travelling to new lands to seek a profession's master.
---
And it makes you a dick.
---
Just because people pay you for your tanking, doesn't mean you aren't a dick for charging people to do something you'd otherwise be doing anyways. Mages aren't charging their group members to port them to org/uc after, warlocks aren't charging for having to gather soul shards and summon the lazy players to the dungeon, etc.
---
No. That‚Äôs not how lawyers work
---
Why do guys that wear NFL jerseys all look the same?
---
It looks like your addon had incomplete info because you haven't scanned the auction house. When you go to the AH, there will be scan and fast scan buttons. (Fast can sometimes d disconnect you, regular scan can take a long time). Use those every time you visit ah, and the addon will keep a database remembering the prices and moving averages of items which will then show up in that tooltip, in addition to the vendor price info, and suggest what it thinks is the most profitable thing to do with the item (vendor, auction, or disenchant). Take the suggestions under advisement, not necessarily as gospel, i usually make my own decision based on the numbers and the differences between the low end of the market and what it thinks is the "market price" during volatile young server economy.
---
Man I had tears in my eyes. Brilliant editing. I normally can't stand videos like this but I watched the entire thing.
---
Ignore that fucker bro, I've been looking for these types of videos for a while now! and you delivered! goood shit bro and please keep em coming!
---
Dps don‚Äôt need to be at full health.
---
I copy pasted it from a comment that I wrote. It is my own opinion. But I‚Äôm not sure how that line is biased, maybe you could explain that to me?
---
And it‚Äôs not meant to be a conversation ender. In fact I think your point that BoE items should go toward people who are more committed, or who have less time to play, is a fair point. Guilds use loot council or DKP to take those kinds of things into account. I just think that question is probably not decidable in a fair way in a five-man pug - so all-need is a fair compromise.
---
Silithus is so alien and beautiful.
---
We( the horde) gank low lvl to halt ur lvling process so that our lowbies can get ahead. Its for the good of the horde.
---
Siiiike We love jus being dicks
---
Yours truly A horde Rogue
---
No i didn‚Äôt imply people enjoy being ganked lol. 
---
I said if it truly affects them as much, or is truly  as damaging you and lots of others on this sub are pretending, there is def something going on that is bigger than WoW in their life. 
---
Also, now I see why you disagree and think I‚Äôm a dick. You don‚Äôt enjoy being ganked, which is usually who I see telling me I‚Äôm a dick. It‚Äôs people taking it personally on behalf of other people, which is silly. 
---
I‚Äôll tell ya something I learned so far in my life: it ain‚Äôt fair, and WoW is the same way. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to be unfairly ganked go to a normal server and wait for BG...Otherwise let us PvP players PvP in peace, under the rules blizzard created and let the other faction can stand up for themself.
---
Saving this for later
---
Oh hey I'm on that server. I'm guilty of occasionally stirring the pot on that one. Some people just get so butt-hurt about it, I can't resist trolling. It's a pointless argument, no level 20 is going to be asking to run Dire Maul, and no level 50 is going to be asking to run Deadmines.   
---
Deadmines came before Dire Maul, so it'll always be DM to me. Dire Maul can be DME/DMW/DMN.  
---
Cookies Cavern is also acceptable.
---
False, spirit is your primary stat in vanilla and BC, after you met a baseline intellect. Mana issues are the number 1 problem to a priest in PVP and PVE. Base stats were way more important in classic and BC than any of the other expansions.
---
Eagles just won so I'm hype
---
Most classes use 1-3 abilities to do damage... classic is very easy on that side if things.
---
Nah. If i'ts not a reset than i'm fine.
---
Not really...except that auctionator does improve the user interface and allow people to actually see what things are currently priced at (or easily purchase things).
---
I edit with Vegas Pro 14 and record with Shadowplay, if you have a nvidea card it comes with geforce experience
---
This isn't about ending a war between two factions, that's the main story of the game and it's what keeps the PvP realms afloat. You're currently playing through campaign that both factions are actively at war. This is about letting every player express themselves to the enemy, good or bad, not just bad. It adds more to the character development for each player and creates a dynamic experience between players/realms. Again, you're still fighting a war, you just have the option to interact with the opposing faction beyond just killing them.
---
Elemental shamans can dps in dungeons, heal in raids, and offtank when needed with mail sp gear + shield.
---
One class viable in all roles.  Hows that first aid heals working for ya' Mr. Warrior?
---
You're getting stuck up on the analogy, instead of trying to nit pick the situation.
---
How would you handle a real life situation where only 1 person can walk away with the card.
---
Don't think of it as an analogy, think of it as a riddle. How do you fairly distribute the card to a single person?
---
yea, i'm generally OK with rolling on upgrades if it is within 1 or 2 levels. A person could get that in the same run. Anything more than that I would say ask the group first.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty cool. I was told this game would be boring and grindy but I‚Äôve played OSRS where you can spend hundreds of hours making fires for a skill that does nothing.
---
I'm glad mate :D
---
Is that recipe high value? If so, it‚Äôs generally expected in pugs for everyone to roll ‚Äúneed‚Äù regardless of if you‚Äôre going to use it or sell it.
---
We can play tick tack toe while you do BRD:
---
- | - | -
---
- | x | -
---
Well you obviously didnt make any extra gold by undercutting more than necessary...
---
If you want to address my points and have a discussion I'm all for it, but otherwise you're just turning this into a dick swinging contest.
---
I've made 20M+ since legion on retail and haven't paid for sub time in years. I've followed /r/woweconomy for years and would love to see you post there saying that "small-brainers" undercut by 1c.
---
Why would anyone do WPVP when you can farm HKs in BGs? 
---
BGs killed WPVP over night, the only people that still did it were gankers griefing and the occassional "im lvl 60 and im bored"
---
Flying mounts killed it further.
---
As a fellow druid player, I feel for you.
---
Very few items in the game that were made for us, but tradition is tradition.
---
In the future just need on all BOE's, every single last one of them.
---
Awesome thanks a ton man!
---
What would Blizzard do? Lol
---
That place is a pretty decent place to farm raw gold for your level 40 mount. That's why I went there.
---
Can someone give me a nice video example how warlocks are on pve/dungeons and in pvp?
---
Like an insight on the class with gameplay
---
Damn, I'm a semi veteran of 12 years who's still ass at the game, and I've only got a lvl 14 priest and a lvl 12 mage because I get burnout too fast
---
There is literally nothing wrong with a quick tell "hey I see you need a tank, I'd be hoping to get X, is that okay"
---
If you're _really_ this salty over that then you need a reality check.
---
Now if someone comes rolling in like an asshole making angry demands then sure. But your problem then isn't entitled tanks, it's that today you met an asshole.
---
And I don't know how many times you have to repeat it, I read almost all of your replies before commenting, and all of them are the same silly nonsense. How many times has this even happened to you? I think you need a guild.
---
Now, here's an experiment, have you ever purposely chosen one dps over another because it meant you had one less person (or none) to roll against? If so you're an incredible hypocrite.
---
As others have said, pre bubbling and drinking is a good thing to do before a fight, just not on a tank who uses rage
---
Shamans with improved ghost wolf or druids can just run away.
---
I don't mind that much, I just wish I didn't have to sell things at a loss, but hey. People need this shit, might as well supply em.
---
it helped brighten my shitty day a little, so thanks! lol
---
Dense is the only way to describe this reply... JFC
---
This is 100% ninja looting. Since when in any world does Needing an item for gold&gt; Needing on your BIS weapon for the whole of classis. Bear tank is the ONLY spec that uses it. Anyone besides the druid who rolled need on that was trying to take it, and as your guildie won it, he obviously did. Now he should have  gotten proof. But the fact the bear doesnt have it, and your guildy does, is really fucked up iMO.   
---
There is no difference between this, and say I need on your pally healing helm , even if i cant equip it, for vendor gold. Except warden staff is worth a shit ton. ALL THE MORE REASON not to force that bear to pay for it, just so you can get a payday.   
---
As  a bear tank i cant tell you how good this staff is. The idea that someone might take the best weapon i will ever use, when  they wont even equip it, couldnt be more ridiculous and greedy to me.    
---
EVERYONE needs gold. I need gold. I need 500 g to get this staff and your not only going to try and make 500g at the cost of 1000g to others ? screw that.
---
He said he needed it. Sold for 70g
---
It‚Äôs not a dick move, you‚Äôre just an entitled player. You‚Äôre mad that someone is getting all they can from their time and class choice. Get a grip.
---
I paid for 6 months knowing I was about to be laid off and couldn't pay for it in the upcoming months yet needed this.  So I'm good.  Now after February....dunno.
---
You can step into BRD at 52, LBRS at 56, and Strat/Scholo/UBRS at 58 (but most people won't take you pre60)
---
you are making a mistake of posting these as reddit videos instead of your own youtube channel video
---
I shall mate don't worry, some people aren't into this type of stuff and that's fine :)
---
You seem too emotionally invested in this. It's fine to enjoy EF without being so heavily defensive.
---
Lashing out and insulting others is more of an indictment of your mental stability than mine.
---
You've been a great ambassador for EF, I definitely want to transfer off of a populated server now. Definitely not toxic.
---
Are they both efficient farming mara for gold?
---
"Whooooooooosh..."  
---
That's an approximation of the sound this post made as it went over your head.
---
I mean you still have frostbolt as a fire mage.
---
First server I(paladin) rolled on. Questing in westfall with my friend, getting murloc eyes for the quest. Lvl 12 warrior charges in and tags as many as possible in fron of our eyes. We watch him die, and he whispers me "why the fuck didn't you heal me?". I respond with just a question mark. The warrior the says: "Good luck ever getting into a raid on this server, you're blacklisted!!"
---
I rerolled on another server the next day. (rip 26k queue on EU shazzrah)
---
I wonder this as well. Got a friend who just wants to pound dungeons every time we are on to level fast, but as I see it, that's just dwindling all the exciting content of the world down to nothing as we speed past it in levels and have no reason to return. I'd rather explore the world, because at 60 there won't be much challenge to most of it.
---
You're free to leave thats your choice. I just treat all my group members equally.
---
Will I have an easier life as warlock or rogue in pvp and pve(solo and dungeons)
---
When you're not high enough get high! You got plenty of Dreamfoil. I hear if you smoke it, you get high. ;)
---
That first engagement had me going, good stuff man.
---
In my case, by the time I completed the quest I already had a better mail chest piece. I'm keeping it in my bank though because the Use ability might be something I can use later.
---
It has spirit, not int. It's not a good staff at all.
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help,nodead] healing spell;
---
It's really not that great for anyone in general. People only want it because it's purple.
---
Just got artisan fishing to find that my Nightfin Soup is going for 3s on my server... rip
---
yes it is, layers allow a server to have several times more players than it would normally have and still feel like the world has a healthy vanilla population instead of the reality that it's an overcrowded megaserver
---
I'm 40 and still using the wand from BFD quest.  Make sure to do that.  It's great!  Honestly, nothing else has been worth farming the dungeons for.  I tried to run most level appropriate ones at least once so far just to re-experience them but once the quests are done it's kind of a waste to keep bothering with them.
---
I'm glad mate, love bro
---
As someone who chose the user name Elan based on Elan Morin Tedronai about a year before that comic started coming out I never know how to feel about my villainous name generally being associated with a totally different character.
---
For ambush crits there are 4. One with an insanely low drop rate, the rest are MC. Lol
---
Try the Clique add on. Let‚Äôs you mind mouse clicks on unit frames to different spells.
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
It can be "boring and grindy" but the thing is that makes all your achievements meaningful. When you level and get a talent point you feel like you *EARNED* it. When you finally get tat piece of loot you feel like you fought for it. When you explore that new zone for the first time it feels like you journeyed there.
---
And I think that's what retail is sorely missing, and why I haven't even felt the desire to log back in.
---
&gt; Do that and you get an item where you keep in your bags and can just hop on the teleporter and you load screen in right at gnomer.
---
FYI, you can delete the item and just talk to the goblin again at any time and he'll give you another one. No need to keep it in your bags indefinitely.
---
Unless you were just clarifying that you need the item in your bag for the teleporter to work, which is true.
---
No drink, only heal.
---
It's part of raid/pug etiquette, inform the group before you even invite.
---
If you recruit people to the raid under false pretenses, you're scamming them of their time and their lockout. That is absolutely against the rules.
---
Priest here, We are the reason your peepees can be so big, our heals actually make it grow. We command you and you listen. We are the queen of battle, you will die to keep us safe because it is what you are made for. You are just our pawns. 
---
But can confirm peepees on warriors huge.
---
This is the perfect game to watch Netflix while playing. I rewatched Breaking Bad while doing quests and it makes it more fun.

If you are only partially drinking, the cost of water can add up a lot.
---
Similarly, can‚Äôt really play comfortably when the GF is home.. but when she‚Äôs not, and I get a break, it‚Äôs fucking go time!! I love smoking a small bowl or eating a low dose of thc, having a beer, and just getting zoned into the world. Love running a dungeon and feeling intentional about it (benefit of no group finder). Love appreciating the world around me while out in the wilds questing. Love making my character feel unique with talent specs and actual specialized gear. Love taking a break to pick some herbs. Love making allies ragelog after spriesting their hopes away.
---
Weird.  Like I‚Äôm not sure but I only ever played a rogue in vanilla just before tbc came out - didn‚Äôt ever play one after tbc - and I remember this being a thing. Might just be shitty memory tho.
---
Wanna chill? Play runescape
---
Wanna make real gains? Play classic
---
Guys, please, is there a base crit chance? What is it for priests? Or is it just 1% for every 59.2 INT (so the base is 0%)? Thanks
---
Thanks, dive!
---
FYI - You only need a level 5 bank alt that can disenchant any level green item. The dust is far more AH friendly than the greens.
---
This has been a thing since the game was released so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue slowly permeating the playerbase. If you don‚Äôt want to join a group with items reserved, then don‚Äôt. Organize your own group.
---
And many people do want to experience the content even with items reserved. We‚Äôve been partial pugging ubrs, ony, and mc with some reserved items and fill up without issue. Reserved items are a price many people are willing to pay for joining an organized group that efficiently clears content.
---
player numbers going up also increase demand and gold supply though....
---
The on use ability gives 20 int. 
---
Tell me what is better for pre-raid phase 1 warlock PvP weapons. I'll wait.
---
&gt;It was said before loot was dropped so it isn‚Äôt. If the loot dropped and then they said it, it would be.   So no it isn‚Äôt.   Be happy 30 minutes were wasted not hours
---
It's just as bad though. Wasting 30min of someone's time is no less bad than wasting hours of the time when it would have been easy to waste none of their time.
---
Yes, that's why I said that as long as they announce it **before the run starts**, I don't have a problem with it, which implies I have a problem with it if they do it once the run has started.
---
What if they say "Mind if I get some of that sweet, sweet Mage Juice from you?"
---
And then have a text macro that may or may not "wring" the sweet Mage Juice from you into a receptacle?
---
And a lot of macros to cut down on buttons on my hotbar
---
I did make it myself, this video took around 20 hours on and off :D If you're serious I'll dm you
---
yeah f%$^ those guys. 
---
I play a mage and usually provide water without being asked, but when I do get asked it often has a "WATER NOW MAGE!" feel to it. 
---
Are there really a lot of asshat mages out there that pull this kind of crap?
---
As a reckoning paladin, I beg to differ.
---
The faction with the lower war mode representation gets up to 30% bonus rep and exp.
---
Which by the way has effectively been a permanent 30% boost for the alliance
---
&gt; Right, that's the flaw in your argument. You assume everyone sees BoEs as gold, and the reality is that most people don't.
---
Says you.
---
Mid pull is some clown shit. Terrible manners.
---
Right click the pet ability and the shiny border around it will turn off which means it is no longer on auto and you have to hit the hot keys or click to use it
---
And most warlocks use rank 1 of the spell, because it costs less mana. So it doesnt even provide any damage, only shame.
---
It's the equivalent of 10 friends making a character at the same time and coordinating and staying organized to quest together.
---
What the fuck are you even on about. 
---
If a tank wants tank gear and joins a 5 man and doesn't get his tank gear, then the group he's with are assholes and deserve to be blacklisted by every tank on the server and suffer. If you're seeing this shit happen in groups, then stop grouping with those people. Keep track of the assholes and don't group with them.
---
If nobody in the group needs it it doesn't matter. If someone else might need it and you put the group in a position of kicking the person who does, or waiting longer for a tank, then you're a dick. It's not about if it affects me directly, it's about you being too lazy to form a group that works for you, so instead you message pugs and make them accommodate you with gear that isn't tanking gear in order for you to go with them, which 9/10 times, someone else needs as well, and they don't have the benefit of being able to form a group in 10 seconds like a tank.
---
Glad that's all you got from my effort. Who's the selfish one? :-\
---
I was at 1400 last night with Fort and blood pact, just made a guess what I'd be at without those without bothering looking up the exact numbers, my apologies.
---
I don't understand why you're so sure about the statements you're making. Throwing out percentages and timelines like it's a fact. Classic is great but you might be overestimating the longterm appeal of a 15 year old MMO to tourists and super casual players.
---
My favorite part is the rogue just trying to diffuse the situation because they dont want to have to wait for another tank/healer to do stuff.
---
Poor guy.
---
Why in the world would you want this?
---
I agree, go away.
---
What do you suggest they do?
---
The Blaumeux life is good. Maybe the perfect balance for an Alliance player?
---
As a night elf hunter. I say good luck because I‚Äôm coming for you with a full supply of consumables!
---
Nope, if they're grey you cant sheep them.
---
As a fellow member of the horde I apologize for this piece of shit ganker. The kind of person that sides with sylvanas on retail smh
---
Wow very important post thank you
---
Yeah that hat is basically BiS Paladin helm....
---
And?
---
Thats not how layers work. Using your example, overpopulated server has 10 layers and 50 people in each zone. Dead server has 1 layer and 50 people in each zone.
---
In any pug, always ask in group chat right before you start if anything is reserved. That way if they're cagey or won't answer everyone can see. Ask clearly and don't settle for an answer other than "yes" or "no."
---
That way if they do ninja something there's no ambiguity if you choose to open a ticket. If they won't give you a straight answer, leave: they're planning to ninja something.

Stay away from the AH and find a good grinding spot with high quality vendor trash.

Tanks will dump rage with HS, thats why he said faster = more abilities.  Faster you can dump rage with HS, the better.  And a large portion of rage incoming is from being hit, so the weapon speed for building rage isn't as relevent.  Only downside to faster weapon is technically it means more parries on the boss, which speeds up their attacks a bit more.

Princesa is fine. Im killing goblin and princess and sometimes getting instance CAP.
---
Crocodile kite strat maybe worth It once i get more gear to avoid capping
---
Boo hoo. There are a couple thousand more horde on my server than there are alliance and let me tell you something, a group of 5 higher lvl campers is just as bad as 10. They blockade dungeons, patrol choke points in zones, camp quest hubs, and don't even think of stepping into Stv as an alliance toon.
---
By how much them killing it is hurting you.. I think they did the right thing. Really put the pain on the enemy faction
---
&gt;You can't drag this shit out for two years.
---
I don't think they plan to. They may have gone with that cycle in original Vanilla, and I may be wrong about this, but didn't they announce phase 2 for like late october? That's two months to phase 2. If they go with a cycle like that, it'll be less than a year until the full pre-BC experience is released.
---
Do you own an Tesla?

My whole guild of about 100 alliance went to EF. There won‚Äôt be many alliance left at this rate. We like it much better on EF. Very balanced.
---
Farm panthers or basilisks in STV for a couple of hours, they drop grey crap worth 5-10s each.  So 10 of those items is already a gold to vendor. Pair it with skinning and vendor everything you will have 100g easyy
---
Can't you just play on a PvE server?  Even if it was balanced, gank groups would still form.  And how would they balance it? Force players to play on certain realms?
---
I'm gonna be searching for you.

planning to respect to ele/resto for shaman at 40. Is it still good to use 2h weps and rockbiter?
---
Frankly I just kill all aoe farming mages out of spite. If I can't do it then you can't either.  
---
Besides, I find it incredibly stupid to put yourself in such a compromising position on a pvp server. Low mana, possibly low health. All while trying to hoard a lot of the mobs in an area all to yourself. Nah. I don't think so. You kill 1-2 mobs at a time like the rest of us, or you can get a work out walking back from the graveyard.  
---
Don't know if you're a mage, just throwing that out there.
---
I got my racial and planning on getting my class one aswell something to pass the time until phase 2 hits
---
Wondering about this myself. I saw a clip of swiftly this morning where he had debuffs above each target‚Äôs nameplates. It looked like threat plates but I know it isn‚Äôt. (Threat Plates is worth checking out though)
---
Not hit 60 till p2, unfortunately. :)
---
Because "common sense" when it comes to WoW loot is: Need for Main Spec, if no one needs for Main spec, need for offspec.
---
Reserved loot is not a standard practice and should never be considered one.
---
This entire screenshot is yikes. If I were you I‚Äôd have just stopped reading and waited for it to end after the 4th calm attempt
---
Agreed
---
Something tells me they won‚Äôt last.
---
Auctionator has nothing to do with the problem. The problem is everyone of you just bitching about not being able to make money off the auction house are the same people that refuse to spend money on it. You think you're the only person trying to let conservatively while you get your account where it needs to be?
---
I wish I did.  Where is this going?
---
No... The players are still on the server. But for example instead of there being 1000 visible players in Ironforge, there are 10 layers with 100 visible players each.
---
Can we remove this post? Op has no idea.
---
Layers are different - layers - to the server to reduce 10k people from beingn in the same zone all fighting for the 12 mobs assigned for quests. 
---
All layering did was allow people to rush to 60 without congestion. The servers will handle a lack of layers.
---
The answer is simple, he acted like an ass and you're overacting and need to calm your tits.
---
Dude wtf? It is absolutely important even if you‚Äôre not in Arugal. This is important to the community.

I was grinning a lot but the mario jump got me laughing out loud. After that, the floodgates were open. Great work.

Maybeeeee
---
Wrecked yoself
---
I was literally halfway through a mindblast when a hunter marks the mob I was targeting. I figured great, he's gonna get the tag and it's gonna agro right onto me.  But I  got my blast off first I guess, cause I got the tag, and it dropped an Underworld Band. Happy times.
---
&gt; nothing in logs except at the start of the raid they said X is on reserve.
---
The point is that they never said. That's when it crossed the threshold from pulling a mild bait and switch and actually scamming other players. 
---
I don't think many people would have an issue with it if reserves were communicated at the start of the run, giving people the chance to find another group or stick around. Making reserves known at the start of the run is totally okay, people may be disappointed and leave but the cost in time is generally minor. 
---
When the leader waits until the loot is on the ground to go "lol reserved," they're violating the code of conduct and can be penalized.
---
IDK, I just ask people who play the same class as me and/or might roll on the same gear as me when I join the group. Like if they have something on reserve, I just tell them I'm cool with it, **if** they're cool with me having dibs on some other piece I want.
---
I'll post it here when I get home, I'm at work right now.
---
Well for 1, because then you need to bring 3 extra people when it's already difficult enough to get loot for some classes.
---
Welp looks like I‚Äôll be going heartseeker from my pvp server thanks for the update op
---
I raided all of vanilla with a conflag lock.  Though he started MC with full High Warlord gear which compensated for his sub par spec.

I think everyone is going pvp spec in phase 2.

Faction specific login queues
---
I mean if youre reserving 40 items then good luck finding people to join. Usually it's just mats and 1-2 items.
---
Can you tell me why mods removed this? It's info I'd like to have as well. We need to make more room for "look what I got" posts?
---
Well that's fine then. In retrospective maybe I just was in the wrong mood as i red the comment. I guess it's more often a good way to conquer great sadness with humor. Everything that helps and makes life enjoyable again is great.
---

---
Super simple, too.
---
Tanks are doing it, people with ubrs keys are doing it... that's what I'm saying. They message you after you've put your "LF1M Tank UBRS then Good to go" message in chat saying "ill go if you can promise me the skinning knife". Suddenly the entire group has to decide if they'd rather wait longer for a tank who isn't an asshat, or give up something they obviously want.
---
I agree paying for UBRS key is standard, assuming they don't need to run the dungeon too. If you have the key and are joining a pug, then you should open the door for free, because they need the key and you need a group.
---
Idk, yeah thats kind of a waste of time for you. But Did you ask? At least the Raid leads in this scenario announced it before any major boss pulls...
---
You can‚Äôt expect your guild to chip in anything for something that purely benefits the individual. If a guild expected me to help pay for someone else‚Äôs hand of rag I‚Äôm definitely finding a new guild.
---
I remember in TBC I would do arenas with another mage (so two mages) and he basically carried me to 2k by himself as Arcane PoM Pyro spec, I love that shit.
---
Have an upvote
---
No, says the game, since the greed option explicitly specifies that it's the option to be selected when you want the gold that comes from the item. 
---
The game provides you an option to select for selling loot, but you conveniently ignore that and how it explicitly defines loot priority.
---
I asked a guy for water the other day, offered a 25s tip, he told me it wasn't worth his time. Fuck mages.

NugRunning for a general overlay. KUI or Neatplates for nameplates. OmniCC and Classic aura durations for unit frames.
---
Hey, a balance druid can help 4 mages do amazing dps.
---
Damn you must have great social skills 
---
Almost all specs work perfectly fine in dungeons 
---
You don‚Äôt even need 5 people 
---
3 dps and a Druid tank 
---
One of the dps sometimes throwing a heal spell is enough 
---
Acting like a random pug has to be min maxed that‚Äôs antisocial if anything 
---
That‚Äôs why you advertise your group and pick likeminded people 
---
Reputation doesn‚Äôt matter that much in classic simply due to massive player count 
---
But if you need an imaginary reputation for you to behave like a proper person then sth is wrong with you
---
yes they are‚ù§

Also you don't really NEED flasks till Naxx, so there goes my 300 Herbalism as a money making machine.

One Small Favor all over again
---
I mean i can need some BoP items from people and vendor then for gold to get me closer to my BiS. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm gonna do it. If I roll need on some else‚Äôs gear, they will be pissed and probably roll need on gear they don‚Äôt need in the next dungeon which causes that person to do the same. Also if I was leveling enchanting would it be okay to need any blue item because I NEED the shards technically. As a Druid, this warden staff ‚Äúninja‚Äú scenario has my blood boiling, nothing against you, just the situation at hand.
---
If you can, put up own MC pugs and if you are good enough and the run is smooth and your reputation cares for it, you can reserve BoE's
---
That means you get the ingot (if it drops) and you get boe epics wich you can sell etc)
---
Agreed. :P
---
I enjoy your concern but that's a shitpost. 
---
I mean it, it's nice of you to take time to write things for people to read! But wooshed it is
---
So now you understand how it is to play alliance on 90% of pvp servers?  
---
good
---
I normally put my first 10 points in combat for the 5% hit, but shortly after that clip I remembered that I wanted to have fun with my life, so I respec'd. I'm going to end up with the traditional 21/3/27 build, maybe 22/3/26, actually.
---
Right i'm with you, reserves were never established, but if loot rules weren't discussed they weren't mentioning it to get people in the raid. They purposely excluded it, probably along with all loot rules so it doesn't look like they switched. They announce it in raid when everyone's there so when they take the item they have screen shot proof it's not a ninja and they told everyone who chose to stay. 
---
It's borderline scammy and bait and switchy. I say border line because it was just ignored rather then asked.  
---
Regardless that's besides the point you and i both 100% agree on the main issue at hand and think its a shit thing to do. 
---
Scammy to me is a guild on my server that charges members (25-50 gold per week to raid) you don't pay you dont get loot.  I don't know the specifics., but I've heard rumors from trusted sources.
---
ok, let's hear the winner of a name you had before so we can all say it was justified and laugh.
---
Robes of power vs shadoweave robes, discuss
---
Yeah, I guess. I'm a noob but other games i've played has been guild over pugs but still, ask before you raid with a guild..
---
Yeah when my vanilla raiding guild got to AQ40 all of the mages respec'd fire and our damage was shit in the other raids.  We went from top of damage meters to bottom of damage meters.  We couldn't clear Rag one week (who we had on farm for like a year) because our dps was so low.
---
If you are sword spec you use a sword in your offhand...faster speed will proc sword spec/poisons more often. Pretty simple
---
This is not true. I not only didn't buy anyhting, but sold leather and some cloth on the AH and didnt have enough gold to buy my mount till 43. Running dungeons makes you the most gold.
---
Walking into the Inns. 
---
I rolled an alliance alt and walked into a Fun Morogh inn. The rooms don't even have doors but it just looks so cozy. Roaring corner fire, bottles of ale all over the place, NPCs that never sleep. It's like a party that never ends. Alliance definitely has horde inns beat by a mile.
---
Are you serious or just unaware of how Fury warrior dps scales?
---
In vanilla MC, a fury warrior swapped his blue/epics for white or grey daggers and still topped damage meters to prove a point to the raid group.
---
As a mage I feel bad for everyone else who has a hard time finding groups for dungeons like ZF and SM but saying we should let spellcleave die is just you being upset that you can‚Äôt be part of it IMO. This is just ONE example of a bad/ignorant player. I pride myself on being a proper mage, like CC‚Äôing the rogue caster that‚Äôs attacking my healer and counterspelling the caster that isn‚Äôt in the AoE mob.
---
Just my own time-approved combo, besides xp/time trackers and guide addon. ShadowedUF, Bartender, Chatter, Quartz and dozen of macros on the top.
---
The rod quest is only hell cuz for some reason people only farm for it in the cave. If you go up above the cave there is a strip where there are probably 40 yetis that constantly respawn. Took me about 40 minutes of farming them for it to drop but it was solid constant killing and good xp during those 40 minutes.
---
Did you do what the whisper said? Cause on your classic server you build a reputation. People will know who you are by your deeds. Chances are you will see that person again. Respect that person that cleared 4 mobs to get to a chest or node. Unless you are an asshole, but i guess the whisper will never know who you are irl so make your choices. Dont be upset though if you get branded a thief.
---
&gt;nevermind that any vanilla raid footage had people AFK, derp around or play so terribly it causes you physical pain just by watchin
---
Another thing to note is that most of the people in said raid were on really shit internet, with really shit computers. Few people had good internet, Fewer had great internet.
---
 And computer wise? Not everyone was rockig decent rigs. Often people'd raid with the game zoomed in with the camera down. And maybe the tanks D/C'd because people int heirhouse used the phone and dial up was real, so they d/c'd. 
---
..And maybe another member was in austrlia so their lag as massive which might make them seem bad due to reaction times.
---
Yeah and it's like a ghost town even med and high pop
---
Streaming killed WoW, in a sense.
---
All these young kids getting into classic are only watching streamers and think they're just as good because they watch them on twitch. 
---
it facked
---
Right. You feel entitled to *value* over someone's actual upgrade at the cost of that person.
---
Take a picture of yourself and lose weight.
---
Necrosis has that plus other helpful warlock utility
---
Lol okay great, you‚Äôre fine with grouping with entitled tanks, good for you, this post isn‚Äôt for you then.

And losing the deposit with the listing.

Netherwind is hard to tell a balance. Every zone is different, but it seems weve landed quite a few retailers who are testing.

-Always overpulling in dungeons be it as tank or body agro as dps.
---
-lack of community participation ( tries elite quests solo and cries in general about difficulty. )
---
Classic is back. Learn the old ways young'uns.
---
The servers would be equivalent. One has a code of honor to not gank , one it is encouraged.  Then like minded players can stick together. That's not the same as pve.   Close leveled players can KOS and attack towns. 
---
What do you have to lose ?  It sounds like you also dont like being ganked :)
---
It should be said in chat. While it isn't ninja looting, they should 100000% be up front. Definitely blacklist that guild, they are only going to get worse.

They are really quite different. Only place they play similarly is raids where you're either spamming frostbolt or shadowbolt. But just about every class is very simple in raids.

They have guns in everlook.  I never tried gadget though.  I seem to remember they do as well.

It definitely *was* like that when it launched. Much better now. Besides anecdotal stuff like how the questing zones "feel", the auction house volume from my daily scans has more than quintupled in the last 2 weeks alone. Transfers have brought it up to a very solid medium pop level.
---
Blaumeux Horde here, can confirm, seems pretty even, maybe 60:40 in favor of the Horde, but you're never too far away from a donnybrook if you want one.
---
Leave it to the professionals.
---
I dunno dude. I just played frugally and had over 100G by 40. I did do maybe a dozen dungeons with friends on my way to 40, so maybe that was it.
---
so a guide I was following lists some 2h wep progression for shaman. I'm assuming this changes for ele/resto? Like ravager is not a good wep for ele/resto shaman at 40? I should go 1h+shield?
---
I was alliance on illidan during vanilla/tbc. Felt like the split was 90 horde/10 alliance.  I feel your pain.
---
Money. Im from outside the us and we dont have regional pricing yet (for example argentina has) so the rise of the dollar is making $15 a lot. At least for me at the moment.
---
You're also very directly insulting other play styles. That's not cool. Saying "go for it" doesn't make remove the rudeness of your other statements.
---
Escape artist is great. The only advantage human warlocks might have is finding a rogue they were already aware of. Considering the only class that doesn't have a slow/root is paladin, escape artist is consistently going to be more useful. Still though, it's not as though perception is useless and otherwise the 5% intellect boost isn't a big deal at all, especially for warlock because of lifetapping.
---
Thank you I know that, but I needed to see buff to dispell with my shaman :p
---
just move on and take another name if the one you want is already taken. dont fucking add stupid shit exceptions to it...
---
Kthxbye. One less casual holding me up in queue.
---
Except every sam dick and harry thinks they are gods gift to tanking and charging a fee for their "services" making it impossible to find a tank.  They way I view it though is that if we r paying you to tank then you dont get to roll on bis items because you clearly dont need them if your charging us to run the onstance
---
Exactly. It's why I carry around 80 reagents for portals. Never know.
---
Because it‚Äôs a fucking video game that I‚Äôm paying 15 bucks a month to play, I‚Äôll play it however I please. Nobody is gonna tell me how I should be playing or acting in a virtual world; that being said, personally I choose not to play with people who are elitists and/or malicious because it takes the fun out of it for me.
---
I remember mining ore someone ran past but I don't know if it was them, and they seemed to ignore it since they just ran past it.
---
Seriously?  Sigh.
---
Add the impolite people to your ignore list. :)
---
Mmh really? I sell 20 for 1g20-1g40.
---
But i get only 1g for 20 bandages so less
---
Attacking the guy who is trying to help you 2 v 1 while being the dominant faction on your server and losing? Yeah that sounds like the horde alright. Did they come back with 3 more people, to make it a really unfair fight? That's what you get for trying to help them and for not choosing to be on the faction that has twice as many players how dare you try to balance out the server!
---
HAD TO HIT EM WITH IT.
---
No, wrong, it does actually imply no loot rules. That‚Äôs automatically implied, always. Loot rules are the exception.
---
This is exactly what I wanted, thank you very much
---
If I'm a PUG member, I always specifically ask for the loot rules. They could have been announced right before I got invited for all I know. IMO it is the PUG members responsibility to ask, as the guild is likely already aware of their own loot rules
---
A quick solution for this is adding "Some items have been reserved, please PST for more info" to the message, or something along those lines. Interested parties can PST you, and you can avoid the wall of text in the main advertisement.
---
IDK why you're so stuck on thinking every non-min maxing spec is broken and unplayable. Prot pallies have a niche and in that niche they are amazing. Classes matter. You have to sacrifice things in this game and that sacrifice makes everything else more valuable. 
---
Check out of Reddit for a bit and just play the game. Read your talents and skills and make your own decisions. Do what you want and not what someone else told you is optimal. 
---
Optimal play style is boring as fuck.
---
If you even use Gouge, sure. But most of the time leveling is just SS, SnD, and Evis.
---
I dunno, I think it's an age thing.  Like how tweens find 'lol so randumb XD' humor hilarious, but I feel like I kind of outgrew it in my 20's.
---
Just curious...are you a mage?
---
Was it in classic?  This is classic we're talking about, right?
---
I'm surprised I haven't found anyone talking about how
---
'A summoned Infernal that is no longer under the control of the Warlock will only affect PvP flagged targets and targets that are on its threat table and will quickly despawn when no viable targets are available.'
---
Almost everyone wants to join a balanced server, but are more tolerant of a skew in their own favor. For example, if I want to play Horde, I might consider 60H-40A &lt;-&gt; 45H-55A to be an ok range to join. Similarly, I would consider leaving if the server was 80H-20A or 30H-70A.
---
If people think like I do, when a server hits 60H, there would be way more horde players than horde joining that server. Additionally, the Alliance players will start leaving the server earlier due to the imbalance. Both factors will make the imbalance larger. This is the exact process we are watching happen on this server.
---
If we show the numbers, this process will be sped up greatly.
---
I laughed
---
I have yet to be camped/farmed like that. But I‚Äôve been ganked a few times where I‚Äôve been really pissed afterwards. Like being afk or 1hp left and no mana against a mob etc.
---
But I really don‚Äôt have the heart to do it back like that when I‚Äôve had the opportunity to do it. I would just feel too bad and full of guilt.
---
Dude wheres my mount
---
Prob because its really short and you can pull the whole instance in one go
---
good luck on your epic phase 1
---
The main difference is the 5% Int boost that gnomes have. It's not super big, but I wouldn't call it negligible. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
had to talk a guild member down off a ledge the other day, he wanted to buy a blue boe for 10g
---
i said, "do you have your mount yet?"
---
he said, "no, i have 10g"
---
i said, "don't buy it idiot"
---
Ahh you caught me.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth buying.  If I entered a contest to win one though, I wouldn‚Äôt expect everyone else to let me win.
---
Errrrr ..
---
Whatever man. For the last time, this happened just the same back in vanilla, people just didn't complain about it as much because people understood that being a tank sucked, you had no other ways to farm, and a tanks time is literally inherently more valuable than a dps's in terms of dungeon groups.
---
Good luck with your classic experience.
---
You can make gold pretty easily with mining/skinning. I was at level 18 with your amount of gold with those 2 professions.
---
Personally I feel it's wrong for a guild with PUGs to reserve loot. I get it, you want that special item and it could take hours to get it, you dont want to risk losing it on a roll. But unless you leave other gear/items that are improvements or of value to the people helping you you're basically a slave laborer.
---
If they are going to use it I don't see why you would call anybody out for rolling need on a BoP blue.
---
That's only if they actually did help them. We have no receipts!
---
I was just curious as I have been getting more and more frustrated with queue times. Server faction is for sure unbalanced and I get my ass kicked by horde a lot. But i have never played the game in any other way than this so I am not sure how the game plays different with a more balanced faction split. 
---
thanks for the info and I hope you're enjoying the game! I can't get enough of it.
---
Uh no, it's an instance of the server, which is why layer swapping became a thing. You had separate instances where you could farm nodes or mobs.
---
What classifies a realm as normal/abnormal? I feel like my realm is pretty normal and STV is quite a shit show.
---
&gt; Strangley usually in favor of the horde.
---
you find it strange the faction with the pvp racials has a higher population on pvp servers? really?
---
and that's when you scoot in and buy that shit and vendor it. easy profit.
---
You keep saying its at the cost of someone else but are forgetting that if we go with how everyone else is letting on here 4 people are left at odds at the cost of 1 person being entitled to get the loot.
---
Its not a token system at all, because not everyone is getting something at the same time. You're just regurgitating the same shit on every comment. No one is asking for a token system.
---
Did thi is with a quest in Felwood. Pally watched me the entire time and helped me escort the dude in the cave. I got to the very end, the elite spawned, and the pally attacked. I ended up killing him (I‚Äôm a war and he used bubble and lay on hands), but he was soul stoned and popped back up and killed me. Then laughed on my corpse.
---
Options, but what I use is an addon I believe it‚Äôs called milk scrolling battle text or something like that
---
Yes. Reserving loot is an accepted and ethically-correct practice. 
---
Secretly reserving loot and establishing a group under not-communicated pretendes with the intent of pulling a bait-and-switch instance of fraud is ethically wrong and not at all acceptable.
---
How come my pet's loyalty decrease sometimes even when I'm keeping him well fed?? My pet just hit loyalty level 3 and then went right back down to 2?

#NOCHANGES gave us this, sadly

Yeah this is why I'm kill on site with gnomes wth is that thing
---
The game is bleeding players as we speak, queues went from 6k to less than 1k in the span of a week. Everything will be fine. I honestly feel bad for the people that rolled on medium pop servers or took the free realm transfers as they will be playing on a dead realm within a month. Blizzard released way too many realms, but they probably did that to get people to buy transfers when they come out.
---
or just play Horde on a PvP server, since that's basically PvE

I disagree though.  I think it's people who vocally speak out to the community about stuff like this that raises visibility of the issue.  Just grinning, bearing it and moving on doesn't help at all.
---
Just add in modifiers. [mod:shift] cat form would always put you in cat form when holding shift.
---
This reminds me of twomads early Overwatch content. I like it.
---
Where did I ever say anything about PUGs, dude? The comment thread I am replying to is regarding guild DKP. Jesus. Learn to read. 
---
It's not about my ego. I'm a priest. I pass on loot to other priests in my guild constantly because I am very carefully trying to build a cooperative guild that focuses on time spent together and the accomplishment of progression rather than just loot. I feel the need to do that by leading by example which means trying to be as selfless as possible in certain situations.
---
But there is also no way I am letting the warrior who shows up to 1 out of 10 raids, can't manage his agro, and is at the bottom of the DPS meter get freaking bindings. That is bad for the guild as a whole when the MT can get it and more effectively tank so EVERYONE can get loot. The warrior that rarely raids can expect to be able to roll on more common drops like set pieces and eventually will get most of the things he needs. 
---
It's not about being a "wannabe hardcore guild" - I was already in a hardcore guild the first time around with several world top 10s in AQ40. It's about FAIRNESS the very thing you are so adamant about. To me, fairness means you get out what you put in and there is no way someone that shows up 1 times out of 50 is putting in the same work as someone who is there every single raid.
---
It's a blast. You can duck in and out of RP as you wish, and it doesn't have to be serious stuff. It could be stuff like OP is doing, or have a character that's racist against Forsaken or something. RP servers are criminally underrated.
---
When you do, you'll be pleased to know that druids do it on all fours.
---
Did you use a guide? I'm 40 now and feeling a little lost all of a sudden. Need to up my efficiency!
---
i just want to be nice :'(
---
depends on the raid, but yeah until they give more or infinite debuff slots you're stuck with the spam shadowbolt builds because warlock dots would take up valuable debuff slots.
---
Outside raids you're micromanaging dots and your pet and CC
---
I dont kill lowlevelers, if they dont pose a threat to me or steal my farm (which they propably wont at 60).
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Unless you just meant visually. 
---
Yeah, I'm referring to production value alone. I don't really follow the story too closely, but I've heard about how fucked it is. But despite that, the production of the cinematic was great, and I'd definitely pay to see a feature-length film like it.
---
&gt;&gt;lol you're an actual moron. Of course when I'm making groups I try and maximize my chance of loot, but I don't kick people already in the group to do so.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;&gt;If you think messaging a full group saying that you want a piece of gear or you won't tank, knowing that the dps in the group are also going to want it, and putting the group leader in the position of kicking the replaceable roles you'd roll against, or spending however much longer looking for a tank is the same as someone forming a group from scratch only taking certain classes, then you're dumber than I thought.
---
&gt;&gt;Your experiment has absolutely nothing to do with the entire reason I made this post. You can form a group however you want from scratch with whatever crazy demands you have, but when you start messaging groups already together with your demands, you're a dick. Even if it's an innocent "hey could I get this?", when it's clearly not tanking gear, then yeah you're still a dick, because some group leaders are going to kick the dps who needs it to fit you in, but why should you care right?
---
&gt;Just quoting you here because once you've realized you've dug your own grave everyone should still be able to read this. 
---
&gt;Have a nice day!
---
Quoting the quote for the same reason!
---
It isn't abuse. It's the cultural standard in PuGs. Every single PuG I've been in over 10 days of /played has done all need on high value BoE. And nobody has ever suggested doing it different.
---
The amount of people on a server does, and layering allows for blizzard to create these mega servers where the economy will be more fucked
---
No.  A permanent ban is what‚Äôs called for here. 
---
This literally ruins the game for people who like the financial aspect and in 39 days those items they cheated into will be right back in play.
---
First of all, welcome! 
---
Warriors are a tough class to level with until ~30.  
---
Especially if you specced Defensive. Fury-spec is more leveling friendly.
---
If that area proves to be a little too tough, you can always try heading to the crossroads and doing some more quests at the Crossroads.  
---
Have you distributed your talent points since hitting level 10?  
---
Have you trained your talents every two levels and replaced the lower level abilities on your hotbar with higher level versions of the same abilities?
---
Oh my, that is *devilish*.
---
Careful with vanilla, its claimed many a life.
---
Yes, warrior is kinda the heavy artillery that needs full support squad to wreak havoc.
---
I'm around 18 hours a week. Full time job, in a relationship, no kids. I was pretty addicted the first week probably did close to 30 hours, but now I'm just enjoying a little alt grinding here and there a couple hours a day.  
---
Now compared to back in the day when I was playing over 100 hours a week, I think I'm doing pretty well. WoW basically ate my life for 5 years or so.
---
Keeping loot from the guy MTing for you seems absurd to me, I straight up pass on tank upgrades if I'm not tanking and the tank needs it ffs.
---
The silliest part is they are clearly in need of a MT and then spit in the face of one gracious enough to help.
---
We don't see anything above that, he could've called it out. Also kids usually don't give you any warning, shit almost literally comes out of nowhere with them. Just because you lack compassion and empathy doesn't mean the rest of us should follow your lead. If I were group lead I'd have kicked you for being an inconsiderate dick.
---
Putting this here for later
---
He isn't an asshole and his logic is accepted. It is standard operating procedure in PUGs and i've never seen anyone even suggest doing it differently ingame so far.
---
If you're DPS, It takes a long time. I could spend half my time struggling with others to farm quest items, then try to get a dungeon group and it takes 30 minutes.
---
but timing is important, it really has to be just before the loading screen.
---
let them swim back, unless fatigue kills them
---
For the Alliance then regardless but love your videos keep em up!
---
You‚Äôre a lost cause. I hope people like you leave the game.
---
I think you're building a strawman and tearing it down.
---
The discussion is about one single item that can be worth dozens of gold, sometimes hundreds, and has influence outside of the dungeon run. This is not the same thing as a BoP item from a boss, that xan vendor for a few gold. Someone looting a kroll blade could motivate them to level a rogue, it doesn't have to be sold. Additionally, warrior looting kroll blade could trade it for a skullflame shield in value, if they wanted to.
---
The point is, one item with that much potential and being tradable is a unique thing, and everyone who participated in the group deserves a fair shot at it. 
---
Regardless, no one can "ninja" the item if the unspoken rule is for everyone to roll need on it. If you're doing your own private dungeon run with friends or guildies, you can set whatever rules feel the most fair to your group... But the thing is; most pug groups don't establish those kinds of rules until the item drops, and often times it ends with someone being really unhappy due to poor planning. 
---
Treat it like a treasure chest. You /roll for the chance to loot the chest. You don't "need" or "greed" a chest. Everything in the chest is tradeable. And chests actually have a high chance to contain a BoE blue or epic. It's the same logic. 
---
You want one standard of rolling for tradeable items of high value, to prevent social problems. Unless established beforehand, always roll need.
---
How am I insulting other playing styles? For one, I didn't mention any specific spec, so if anyone if offended by what I wrote, I can't really be blamed and it's certainly not what I'd call a "direct" insult, and, in context, I was replying to someone who claimed he liked to be able to play a spec "while watching YouTube and eating cereal"... That is boring *to me* (in my opinion), if that's fun to you, then **go for it**.
---
And for the record, I played MW Monk on retail, dominating healing meters and outDPSing the lower DPS in our raid group (which was top progression on our server) using a single /castsequence macro. If that's your idea of fun, I'll share that macro with you when Classic MoP is released...
---
I don't mean to insult people when I share my opinion, I'm open to dialogue, but as you can see if you read further down the thread, the person I was initially talking to certainly didn't feel that way, which might explain why my comments became rather asinine.
---
That makes sense to me, but I see some screenshots where people have like four or five of the same heal in their bar and I can‚Äôt understand why it isn‚Äôt just two haha
---
Well, Duskwood&amp;Ashenvale definitely aren't quiet :D .
---
What? No.... The flex points in 21/30 are holy reach, healing focus, and imp renew. You obviously take holy spec 5/5, I hope that's not what you meant or was just a bad example
---
I don't think they massively change your playstyle, but there are tons of priest builds other than 21/30
---
had to skip forward a good bit to find it but that was actually really impressive hah. im a rogue so the whole time i was like uhhh yeah right you see those top class colors? y e l l o w baby oh wait wtf woah alright.. ok..
---
I don't know anything about druid but from my limited experience they seem to be way better 5 man tanks than warriors especially in the aoe everything meta.  I am a warrior and it's a struggle for me to hold agro on 2 let alone 3 mobs while my group is training them down.  Did a farm run last night with a druid and he barely lost agro on anything even when we were doing 5 mob pulls.
---
I'm glad I play a tank and don't have to deal with this shit.
---
This guy acquired the mount over the weekend, roughly 200 hours or 8+ days of playtime.

I have like no editing software or actual skills at that stuff. Its a fraction of what i wanted it to be, but glad you liked it haha.
---
That‚Äôs when you thank them for whatever they plan to give you!
---
Instructions are unclear, what are "friends" aha
---
I've yet to see proof of there being more than 2 layers on any server in the past two weeks.
---
You‚Äôre just asking for practically the same result for the same reasons the token system was introduced. 
---
What you‚Äôre forgetting is that the need/greed system guarantees you your pieces barring the rare ninja and everyone else the same chance for gold through items nobody needs. 
---
Vanilla was a game where the majority of people would congratulate their party for getting a bis time. Classic is a game where you‚Äôre upset at losing out on a little gold when someone gets their item.
---
There are two "official" goon squad guilds, and both are Horde. &lt;Goon Squad&gt; on Herod, and &lt;girls only&gt; on Mankrik.
---
this is the pretty consistent generic build outside of the farming spots others do like fel/runecloth/demonic rune farming or essence of water/life farming that everyone else does and when layering goes away, instance farming is the best + you can charge lower level players for runs if they want specific items rather than vendoring them.
---
Even though Im loving classic, as a veteran, I envy those who are seeing this world for the first time. I remember how breath taking it was when I first went through it.
---
It‚Äôs not a problem as long as it‚Äôs advertised up front.   Sometimes people run a dungeon 40 times without seeing the drop they need, and it feels really bad to invite a random on #41 just to have them win it.  
---
The other option would be for them to just exclude any class that could roll, which is worse overall. 
---
If they are calling reservations once everyone gets to the dungeon, then that‚Äôs BS.
---
They banned my chibbytits....now I'm chubbytjts
---
i level as holy/disc cause i hate myself
---
Except when your sever has 4-5 layers and those 20k -25k people try to log in at the same time and cant be distributed to other places, there will be que times. 
---
Oh the weekends i‚Äôm still seeing 9k ques. Just you wait.
---
I'm on a low server and I constantly have to compete with loads of people for quest drops. Really not dead... almost wish it were.
---
Extra swings do sound amazing for proc-based DPS like Paladin and Shaman at least. There are many best-in-slot lists that have *Hunters* think they want that 20 AP trinket to go with their Dal'rend set.
---
I‚Äôve got 3 tanks on my friends list as a Warlock. I‚Äôve never wanted for one for a group. You get it.
---
It doesn't mean you're not the type of person lol...
---
Happened to me except they killed mine. I had no horn anymore. So I did what I had to.
---
I stole the next person's.
---
And the cycle continues.
---
I attacked gnome warlock of equal level. Beat him. Then he soul stoned and killed me with about 2 percent health left.  I still won fair and square. Look at how much health your soul stone gave you - 400 of 829! No honor in attacking him after that.
---
Glad to know that the class I enjoy playing even 15 years later is still at the bottom of the list. Cant catch a break in retail or classic
---
argued with friends for a few days about it and in the end we all transfered to heartseeker and have had a great experience the server is healthy and popping
---
You realize that people with math and statistics heavy backgrounds made most of the specs that are the meta right? Those people are guaranteed to be smarter than you. If you don't think that then you feel free to link your sheets of calculating your efficiency with whatever meme spec you are using.
---
This was possible in early vanilla but they were eventually made immune (still during vanilla) because I guess people who weren't warlocks cried about you getting to enslave a useful demon for once.
---
Hmm I'm 57 now and can't remember where I farmed at that lvl. I think your best bet is the non elite fortress in badlans.
---
But also the reason my BoE didn‚Äôt sell üò≠
---
ye? try hitting 52 and soloing devilsaurs and taking their leather. shits cash and fearspam is op
---
typical horde
---
Am I the only one who hates those Icy Veins guides?
---
All the ranks are essentially a trade off between heal per mana and heal per second. Sure you could use the lowest rank that has scaling, but your heal per second would be quite low. So typically healers have 1 for max rank for burst healing, 1 lowrank for super efficient healing, and 1 or 2 ranks that are a good trade of high hps while still keeping up mana. 
---
IIRC for BG's, there's a holy paladin spec that is perfect for raiding and pvp at the same time. And for priests typically PI is more common BG'ing.
---
Lol Jesus man this is getting old.
---
If a tank wants to reserve an item, he should form a group or advertise himself in chat as wanting a certain item, not message near full groups demanding the loot that others obviously need to, putting the leader in a position of having to decide if he should kick the dps or force everyone else to wait longer for a tank.
---
I‚Äôm not expecting a tank to see my group and offer to tank despite not needing anything, I‚Äôm expecting them to go in and have guaranteed loot for tank gear, and /roll against everyone else for offspec stuff if he needs it, assuming they need the dungeon at all. I‚Äôm not saying anyone should waste their time.
---
I have tank friends, and a guild I run with when possible, but this is an issue I felt like venting about as I‚Äôve experienced an excessive amount of it any time I try to pug anything.
---
You are free to make your own group and loot rules
---
Most people that use the ah in mass run addons for buy and sell. It's an easy fix to get one for mass buying or spotting deals
---
I bet those people still complain about their new server too.
---
Layers reduce the strain on the server from tons of people packed in one area, this reduced strain actually frees up more resources to have a higher player cap.
---
If someone is putting together and organizing a group because the want to specifically target a piece of gear they are free to do so and they announce that fact up front so that others who need that item can find a different group.
---
Seems totally normal. If you want a run without reserves, why not organize one?
---
Auctioneer won't let you batch sell items that are bellow vendor price
---
Depends on what I'm doing really. I play nice relaxing songs while out and about questing and when I'm gold farm I bring out the WUB WUB WUB WUB WAAAAAH WAAAAAH WUB WUB WUB WUB and proceed to destroy my ears for hours at a time.
---
Subtle as a hammer in the face. Loved it.
---
People that don‚Äôt want the item reserved will goto these i‚Äôd think. Why not, if lfg is slim
---
thanks for this, how the hell do you solo some of these quests? feels impossible as you need to kill multiple mobs at once on some of the escort quests for example
---
What exactly was stupid about it?
---
I remember stacking HP and surviving a POM Pyro in WSG that had Crit for 4k. The horde mage was very surprised and there were a ton of emotes exchanged.  
---
(also I remember this being significant, but right now im still level 36, what is the avg HP for players at 60 in Vanilla?)
---
Lol, sometimes it almost feels like karma fucks you for being nice. The other day I noticed a warlock, almost dead, sitting down to eat/drink. Figured, nah, Ill just go turn in my quest. At that point a hunter showed up and they both killed me, then were waiting there to corpse camp me when I came back. 
---
Felt bad thinking I could have just gibbed the lock while he was sitting and killed the hunter (found him solo later on and got him). Oh well. The fact that they waited to corpse camp me means I probably pissed them off at an earlier point, so I didnt feel too bad dying. Went to grab a snack, and they were gone by the time i came back.
---
The 5% int is completely negligible, the escape artist in pvp is a massive difference in quite a few matchups.
---
Thanks for the kind words stranger!
---
Giving someone an BoE to sell is giving them an upgrade, because they can then go buy upgrades. Giving someone a BoE to use is giving them gold, because they saved the gold from having to buy it on the AH. BoEs are interchangeable and have equal value to all party members. This is obvious.
---
very common to run those 3
---
Cheaters also try to argue legalize to legitimize their cheating, so a post like this is expected. 
---
Do go on.
---
&gt;And yes, what you‚Äôre talking about is called utilitarianism.
---
Lol. You have no idea what I'm talking about. 
---
Utility is an economic term that refers to the amount of satisfaction and benefit an individual gets from consuming a good or service. There is no ethical implications when discussing this. 
---
&gt;  I still don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúsystems‚Äù you‚Äôre referring to, nor what rules you‚Äôre talking about. Blizzard hasn‚Äôt published any overall looting rules lol. 
---
I literally copy and pasted the exact "system" in which the player base has agreed upon in pugs. This "system" is the whole basis of your post. 
---
&gt; I have no interest in making rules. The rules differ from every guild/group/person playing this game. 
---
Then don't bitch when someone rolls need on an epic BoE that they can't use.
---
How is there are height difference. Aren't all humans the same height? This isn't Elder Scrolls.
---
I always reserve items when they drop.
---
I like it at higher levels, but early on I can wand for just as much damage.
---
Drain Life does heal, but it costs about the same mana as it heals so that's a wash.  Also any interruptions reduces the trade off.  AND the healing generates additional aggro off my pet.
---
So I usually would rather wand for a lot of the time leveling.
---
you're 52 with 182 shadow damage? Im the same level with shadow and dreamweave gear and only get like 100. Wheres the other 82 coming from?
---
The situation is looking grizzly
---
I was a lock in vanilla too, during the time where they were absolutely broken...and also I sucked immensely. Button clicker, melee etc. Are they good enough now to take a rogue 1v1 at 60?
---
Mind me asking what UI addon/ Text this is?
---
Nobody charges their group members though, and if they did, I‚Äôd call them out as well. It‚Äôs part of what you bring to the dungeon/raid group.
---
Anyone else read that whole thing and not notice there were 2 warriors till the end? Jus me?....
---
That's when I think "congratulations,  you played yourself"
---
I would assume the poster is recalling a story from Vanilla 15 years ago
---
92 is in fact 50% of 99. Change my mind.
---
The ui is Shadow Unit Frames, and the text is just a universal font change i did for the entire game.
---
There were dungeon loot lists, and you can believe every player was salivating over the single digit % drop chance items.  As early as WC and Deadmines people would try grinding dungeons for loot they'd never see....heck, getting that dungeon loot without over leveling it was the key part of twinking.
---
I remember doing an SFK run at level 30 range on my lock because of an arugal drop I wanted and there wasn't an SM group running.
---
Ironfoe is BIS for war tanks
---
Quests until revered, and then cloth and morrowgrain until exalted.
---
Clearly this player nevet intended to roll on a PvP server. Ptobably followed horde streamers there thinking it was cool lol.
---
&gt;Sure, if boring is your idea of fun, go for it.
---
If they are enjoying it, it's not boring to them. There are many ways to express your opinion without putting other people down. I don't think you're being intentional malicious or anything, but if somebody said that to me IRL, I'd consider it a nasty comment and would not be very pleased.
---
you enjoy walking back to your body more than killing bosses?
---
I havent seen someone use pk since I played d2
---
And 100% complaining about mages.
---
Hey man, ignore the hate. This shit is hilarious and brings me back to the real Vanilla and Halo 3 days.
---
If you dont want me to vendor your BIS plate pieces better run with all guildies.  Either get lucky or earn it like everyone else lmao.
---
and that will get banned along with a few days suspension
---
Most people dont go drain tanking until 40 because life drain up to that point has a super low base damage.
---
That's the reason you even have downtime. Watch that change immediately at 40-50.
---
Yeah, it is. This isn't on the invited player though. If you pug, the responsibility to explain loot rules is on the party/raid leader. Otherwise, the expectation for everything to simply be need/greed prevails. If people pull this garbage, I will blacklist and ostracize them as best as my guild and I can manage, including reporting them to their own guild in an attempt to get them removed.
---
Acting like a piece of shit gets you treated like a piece of shit and summarily ignored.
---
Yes you are wrong. You should know by now to ask what the exactly the loot rules are prior to joining and if anything is reserved. Get those detail in in-game chat and cover yourself.
---
Mages can already farm 60g/h rn anyway so
---
Have you specced for Siphon Life yet? That was a big game changer for me. Also, I would choose between Siphon Life and Immolate in your rotation. Not both unless you're fighting a mob 2 or 3 levels higher. They're about the same mana cost and Siphon Life will help you a lot more with your uptime.
---
You don't need to stay at 100% hp/mana all the time. You can still comfortably kills mobs at 40% assuming they're the same level, or even 1 higher.
---
That is not a screenshot, that is a photo of your screen
---
my gold sits on my alt so i always feel broke
---
the best wpvp experience i had was on warhammer online, where you could pvp freely, but if you were too high level (like a level 35 in a level 10-20 pvp area) you were transformed into a chicken and became a freekill.
---
Many people protested and gave ton of explanation about how being camped and greykilled in chain by overpowered high level players were a good mechanic and part of the fun, but in the end, it make wpvp so freaking enjoyable because you were always in position to DO SOMETHING and fight back.
---
Acting like a rogue is training anything but crippling and instant while leveling lol
---
Neither, bloodweave robe.
---
If you want to play more by yourself try and do quests that are green/yellow to you. You should still have a lot of quests left in the barrens. Pick up the add-on questie from curseforge which will show you where quest givers are. Warriors are very gear dependent so make sure your gear is up do date. If you aren't following a talent guide I would suggest looking one up as well. Look up quests for rage fire casm and knock that out. Also kill any mobs you see on the way to quests this adds up to be a lot of xp if you're trekking across a zone to do something. Barrens mobs are pretty spread out so you won't have to worry about fighting two-three dudes all the time. 
---
If you can make friends with a shamman, priest or druid that will help a lot. Healer/war combo is dope. Add chill questing/dungeon buddies to your friends list and try to tag along with them when u play.
---
Lvling first aid is crucial for warriors also. Maybe consider lvling cooking as well so you aren't sinking your money into food all the time.
---
Idk what lvl you get hamstring but hamstring kiting is super helpful against mobs that hit hard and have faster attack speed than you. Check your weapon speed and try to time your autos only stepping into range when you can attack. 
---
Google is your friend, check out warrior lvling guides and that should help you a ton.
---
OH YEAH! SAY IT TO MY FACE!
---
*feigns death*
---
Glad I could help you with mind flay lol sorry I took too long.
---
Is what acceptable? Everyone needing? I mean basically I would say yes it‚Äôs acceptable, or at least not a ‚Äúninja‚Äù. I mean needing a BoE that only sells for 25g when someone really wants it seems a little douchey but it‚Äôs not a ninja, to me. Personally if someone else really wanted a 25g blue I‚Äôd just pass on it and continue the run. And if I were the one who wanted the blue and someone else took it I would also just continue the run. It‚Äôs not worth creating some drama and breaking up a group that took 30 minutes to put together over a cheap-ish blue BoE. 
---
But every group should always discuss loot policy, ideally at the start of the run but if not then at least when something valuable drops, before everyone rolls. The nice thing with BoEs is that if loot rules are unclear and someone messes up their roll choice the group can reroll after the fact.
---
First, for your first time dont stay at Silver Pine forest. Go back tk the Barrens and run some Rage Fire Chasms. Its a dungeon inside of orgrimar, lots of groups always looking for people in the trade chat (once you are in a main city).
---
Yup! Legendaries in classic are basically a guild item, so I get that, but telling people to play with you with no chance of getting the game's rewards is just dumb.
---
44 is a bit low for Hinterlands - the Jinta'Alor area needs pre-quests from the other mentioned areas and others are 46 to acquire.
---
I do, I just dont think this type of behavior should be normalized. Imagine the fresh 60s position where the meta is every class reserving items for individual dungeons (hoj, dalrends, briarthorn Reed to name a few) I just dont think it's how the game ought to be.
---
Like by all means if they want to make the groups and go through the struggle of finding people who will meet their conditions I guess it's fine, but I personally frown upon it and wont ever join these groups regardless of if need the item or not.
---
Hey, what's the song at the end of the video?  It's very familiar.
---
we had a guy called humantrafficr his name got banned he then went ahead with unclebadtouch ... expecting that to be banned soon too and to top it all hes now in a guild called wipe power ...
---
Sweet! I think you're the first Kurinnaxx player I've seen on reddit.  Haven't ran into any bad players yet, but I'm only level 37.
---
If you aren't a part of their guild, they should never reserve gear from you, that's a total dick move. It's one thing to pass on an item for your guild mates because it will help your guild with progression, it's an entirely different thing to be used for your utility value with no chance of recompense

As a warrior, whenever someone gives me some stat food or an elixir etc at the start of a dungeon I'm really grateful and will consume them immediately, but damn if I don't look at that +10stat and think how much I'd rather save it for when I'm questing and don't have a healer with me!
---
Basically - all over the place :)
---
This is a great one. I've always skipped nodead personally. Notice the @ only works occasionally for me so I just longform with target= xD

Oh Hai! I'm a druid on stalaag
---
I don't think you ever would get much use out of having 4 levels of any priest spells, and I highly doubt that a high percentage of priests do. Maybe 3 ranks for greater healing but it's not super necessary.
---
It all comes down to minmaxing though. Once you hit a point where you're extremely comfortable with priest and can figure out which rank of heal will get someone closest to 100% without going over, you would be playing slightly more efficiently by using rank 5 greater heal instead of rank 7. 
---
Wowhead has a decent guide [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/spell-down-ranking-classic) (scroll down to priest) that shows you which spells are commonly downranked, which situations are best to use them, and the rest of the guide has more info about deeper mechanics if you're interested!
---
Those quests are literally from hell
---
Can you actually spellcleave endgame dungeons? UBRS LBRS BRD Strath?
---
Need to be really careful about this. It's so easy to abuse. People should be providing a lot of information to definitively prove of wrongdoing. A small snippet of a chat log doesn't answer relevant things. 
---
Example: What if a hunter tried to roll for dal rends? Leader said "dude no, and you got a bow, and this isn't hunter loot. Rogues and warriors roll". Then the hunter only uploads the text snippet with limited information, the responsible leader is put "on blast" and the successful troll just demonized a player or guild. 
---
That's why there are rules against calling people out. It should require a lot of proof but this subreddit believes everything we see, even with nothing to go on. We love to have something to hate.
---
That's the rogue life XD
---
This is an improved version of that.
---
The arms warrior can now come if he wants, whereas before he would have been hosed if that was the only group running(which might have been the case if there weren't healers wanting to run the dungeon)
---
This no longer works tries yesterday 3 times. When you mc someone off, you instantly dc and end up at a graveyard, or you dc and when you log back in they are still on the boat.
---
I never reserve, but if I'm only running for 1 item I tell people beforehand, so people don't freak out when the tank rolls need on a dps 1her or the like.
---
When people try to reserve things I generally just bail on the spot. Its impactful if I'm tanking the run.
---
Read the image again, he didnt.
---
I let people know if Im about to go afk, it takes literally a fraction of a second. If an emergency does come up and Im forced to bail on my group I apologize and own up to it.
---
Compassion and empathy goes both ways.
---
I'm 36, so I relate to your SM experiences lol
---
Wow at 41, very well done.
---
I've had so many nodes jacked it's a little insane to the point I randomly say I'm clearing for this node over and over
---
I took an hour or so and just played with all the settings. It's not perfect, but I like it.
---
My favorite ending boss fights are when the tank goes down and I drop my DPS morph, pop off a heal or two, set HOT on myself (pulling agro in the process), pop into tank morph and finish the battle.
---
Alright cool, thanks for the heads up
---
Haha good luck bud
---
This is the more elegant solution in my mind. You can easily psuedo reserve items by just being selective about who you bring, that's always been the meta, but outright claiming an item just feels bad, and it's not a behavior I wish to see or participate in.
---
Tanaris has a lot of quests around that level. You can probably finish off STV.
---
 If you're Horde, then Swamp of Sorrows is great too, and Dustwallow Marsh is worth a visit for the dragonkin quests.
---
If you're Alliance then there are a bunch of quests in Hinterlands around your level, but Horde will probably want to hold off for a few more levels before diving into Hinterlands quests.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHA UNTIL 30 HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAH. 
---
I‚Äôm 54 and still struggling with more than one mob
---
He's talking about enslave demon as a warlock.
---
Mine is completely filled with shamans. I don't know why shamans are so bloodthirsty on the server I play on.
---
Just... Don't join that group?
---
I'm so confused how people are so upset about this. I personally don't do it. But I couldn't care less that people do. Just find another group. Make your own.
---
Honestly I consider it a better alternative to just flat not invited certain classes to avoid having loot competition.
---
Hahaha same here lol
---
It got my soul from vanilla to wotlk, after that i dropped it slowly.
---
But its back
---
Finally, a person of skill and talent.
---
You‚Äôre just assmad that you got downvoted for whining so now you‚Äôre walking back your original post.
---
You're always a DPS. The "tank" in drain tank just means while solo questing/grinding you're going to be taking some hits (tanking) and making up for it with drain life / siphon life. In a group scenario you'd never be a viable tank, it's just referring to the act of taking damage in solo as "tanking."
---
The general rule is that something you will use (including future upgrades and profession patterns) get need, while everything else is greed.
---
Some people will argue that items that clearly fit one class better than another should go to the appropriate class (ie str+stam ring to the war over the rogue), but your mileage may vary.
---
Similar opinions apply when an upgrade is much larger for one person then another. Some people claim that the person who needs it more should get it, while others argue that you shouldn't punish someone for running an instance in good gear.
---
An unspoken, common rule is that everyone rolls need on extremely high value BoE items. This is to prevent people from trying to steal it by waiting for others to greed, and then rolling need.
---
&gt; I mean every one of the most upvoted comments in that post side on needing on epic boes
---
Of the top 5 posts, 2 are siding with "Don't take someone's BiS," while 3 are "Need all." So it's clearly not every one of them. If you extend to top 6, it's split 3-3.
---
&gt; Top 10 threads all sharing the same sentiment.
---
The top 10 threads of this sub are funny quips, photos, and talking about how a streamer failed at Classic. None of them relate to looting.
---
Look, I'm not saying that people aren't allowed to have a differing opinion. If, in your groups, "N all" works, then roll with it.
---
But suggesting that there's some invisible consensus that *everyone* should always roll N on BoE, **especially* BiS weapons, is silly. It doesn't exist. 
---
&gt; The problem is one system is vulnerable to someone ninja looting and the other isn't 
---
To this, I would say that's not something you can solve by degrading every item's value to "how much gold is it worth?" 
---
Your proposed system would work great in a token-based economy, but that isn't what WoW is. It's individual pieces of loot, for individual groups, consisting of individuals with differing values and level of play. 
---
There are plenty of ways to earn Gold, but a BiS is not always going to be available, much less for a fair/reasonable price. Just because an item doesn't have "Druid" next to it, doesn't mean it isn't clearly meant for a specific class - and if they're present for that item, I believe they should have priority.
---
&gt; articulating it to the group beforehand.
---
This, yes, I agree, because when you have an understanding and reasonable group of people, you can plan for these things beforehand and avoid OP's situation entirely.
---
I remember I watched a video on his twitch channel after someone told me about Grizzly having a mage who streamed. The very first clip I watch he was bragging about how good his DPS was on a particular boss fight because he was able to get a..... Precasted Frostbolt off as they pulled the boss... lolwut? sick mechanics bruh.
---

---
War. War never changes.
---
I go by the creed "Free with your mats, tips are appreciated."
---
I have found people to be more than generous with these terms. Usually I get a 10-25g tip for devilsaur.
---
However, I always have them come to me and they have to have all the mats including the thread as I dont carry any.
---
You ready check every trash pull in dungeons?  You rdy check 50 times over the course of an hour?
---
I was originally planning on going Horde this time around, but the lure of the wintersping saber won me over in the end.
---
This 100%. Literally everyone in the game is penny pinching for their mount. Once they get it, that's when they can spend on boes, professions, alts etc.
---
As a warrior, I have not done well in pvp so far.
---
It depends on if you're Alliance or Horde. Most Horde quests in Hinterlands are like level 48-50ish, but Alliance has a bunch of Hinterlands quests in the 43-45 range.
---
Refuse to run with them. 
---
That‚Äôs what I do and I‚Äôm one of the better healers on my server.
---
Do what I do. Hit 60, go to stv or arathi or w/e, hang out for a bit, and camp the living piss out of any lvl 60 you see. 9 times outta 10 they are terrible players and that's why they camp lowbies.
---
Here‚Äôs a tip: When you (rarely) have players better than you... ask them for tips. I‚Äôve never played WoW before but I‚Äôm by no means bad. I was usually #1 damage without much problem over many teams and dungeons. Until I saw a mage who blew me out of the water. He was 5 levels lower than me and he outdps me without contest. I was #2 trying to do my perfect little rotations I saw everyone else here post and ahead of the other mages but this guy was doing 150% more damage at lower level. I mean everything was on point the entire time. He only spent enough mana he needed so by the time warrior even could pull he was ready. He never got close enough to get threatened but was always close enough to DPS the whole wave. Knew exactly when and how to weave in damage to maximize his DPS. When pull went bad he knew how to fix it when everyone else was about to cry wipe with perfect movement and iceblock/blinks. I wanted to get that good so I asked, and he was happy to guide me down and point out exactly what I missed on each phase... like not throwing in AE when I‚Äôm walking up to nova or how to use cone for controlling wave rather than just damage source. Idk a lot of things are pretty basic: Press this combo and it‚Äôs ez peezy... but there is only 2 mages I saw who stood out from the rest and he was one of them.  
---
Funny enough, when you start grouping with them you start playing with their friends who also likely better players.. now I got better priests and such in group.
---
Hammer of Bestial Fury is Phase 4, and one of the first, if not the first, with druid form attack power on it.
---
The Unstoppable Force chance on hit proc does not work with druids in form and is phase 3. The stats on it just aren't as useful as the mitigation weapons or alternatives like MCP.
---
The End of Dreams is phase 6. Still viable, but the Blessed Qiraji War Hammer gives better tanking stats, where the end of dreams has a lot of stats a tanking druid won't need (tries too much to be a hybrid weapon)
---
Warden Staff (Or Unyielding Maul come phase 2) are just so good for mitigation that nothing else really beats it. Blessed Qiraji War Hammer from AQ (phase 5) is probably the best as it has a good balance of mitigation and additional attack power for threat. 
---
There just isn't anything else with the raw stats of the Warden Staff for mitigation and the MCP's ability and druid's lack of reliance on weapon damage in forms makes it reliability the best option for Threat-per-Second. Not every fight needs a MCP though, so just raw stats are fine if you need threat gear, but aren't likely to be needed in these early phases I would bet.
---
I dont, as stated. I'm more curious about how people feel about it on average.
---
Who cares move on quit crying. We all die one day and nothing we do will matter or be remembered.
---
I like how that cow Warrior panic-hit Retaliation against a caster. Literally wasted a 30 min CD.
---
They should add paid transfer. I know it was added with naxx and persistent world etc., but right now some people are stuck on pretty much unplayable realms which ruins the experience by forcing you to endlessly grind dungeons. Free migration to new realms isn't really a viable option in the long run, I think. One month later the player base has already decreased significantly. For someone who plans to play for a while, moving to a new realm is a death sentence. In 3 months it's gonna be dead with no pool to recruit from for raiding. If you plan to raid you should play on a full realm, queues are almost gone already. Since there are no official stats on faction balance, it's a gamble whether you end up on a realm where you can sustain a raiding guild.
---
Pretty sure it is 5 in an hour
---
So let's say you do a run at 
---
5 
---
510
---
520
---
530
---
540
---
You cant do another one until 6
---
So now it will look like
---
6
---
Now you have to wait until 610

luckily for me, the serious relationship i was in ended a few months before release, so i can spend all my time on WoW!
---
the first half is 44-45 mobs, does it still gives enough xp at +8 lvl?
---
Ugh, not this again. Agree on a loot system at the beginning of the dungeon/raid. Not everyone thinks the same way when it comes to loot. If someone violates the loot system agreed upon, that person is a ninja and should be kicked/shamed in trade chat and put on ignore.
---
Early game healing is a joke. Done several instances with a shammy and priest healer and it's super easy don't be intimidated at all. Just try to learn to abuse 5sr
---
Someone's salty they can't get into a dungeon group.
---
you gotta keep making these
---
100% my experience as well. The second half of 30 felt like it took forever (granted, I didn't grind SM and maybe that makes a big difference). But once I got into the 40s leveling really felt like it took off again and didn't really stagnate again till around 54
---
I'm slim, you rang?
---
It would be close still imo. Even worse if the lock is an Orc.
---
I was a rogue, maybe it has something to do with making poisons as that gets pretty expensive.
---
Where do you find them ? I havnt found a single black lotus yet:(
---
If he just spams frostbolt he's not playing fire mage, he's just playing a frost mage who threw away a bunch of talent points. Him wanting to play fire mage would imply he will be using fire abilities and rotations...
---
Grats on half an epic mount.
---
Yeah I only spend on leveling professions, but nothing extravagant, just stock recipes from trainers and "deals". I'm actually up to 40g I just realized, but still 50g away with only 2 levels to go. Hopefully I can make a bunch this weekend!
---
If my memory was that great then I wouldn‚Äôt need to save phone numbers in my phone.

Meta stands for Most Effective Tactic Available
---
Biggest issue is that without transmog you look like a Hobo. Honestly, I‚Äôd love BiS lists like IcyVeins or Wowhead to include ‚Äúalmost‚Äù BiS. 
---
This would help those who don‚Äôt want to grind instances more than 200 times or pay 400g. Is there something 95% as good at 30% the cost?
---
Also helps those who want to min/max their appearance without having trash stats.
---
Yeah that's a tough call!
---
I would have made the same call if all my friends had not already rolled Horde the week before I even started playing Classic lmfao
---
debuff slots
---
shhhh
---
Oh man did I hate that place. Took me solid 2 hours for the drop
---
Yeah I dunno. I feel like even on a PvP server it would be more lucrative to play when not many others are and go for the higher gold farms. Full pop servers are busy, but they're not busy every hour of the day. I doubt there'd be much competition at 3AM.
---
Hahahaha I‚Äôm not even mad.
---
Hahaha that's awesome. I was a huge noob back in the day (probably still am) and was wall jumping around the back side of IF. I ended up falling off of a mountain. That's how I found out you could die as a ghost from fatigue, when I tried walking around to get to my body D': 
---
&gt;Ignorant Fearless as I was,
---
Hahah. Nice touch.
---
Looks like I managed three discussion posts before the ad-hominem responses started; not bad for a gaming community. This sort of thing usually means the productive chat is over, though, so I'm out. If you guys think it's ok to insult others as long as they've done so first, that's your prerogative. I disagree strongly. Enjoy your evenings, erryone.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the auto-report system gives out permabans but my friend was reported for having the name ‚ÄúStankybutt‚Äù and was told ‚Äúif you need clarification as to why you were banned,  consult your friends and family‚Äù. 
---
Again this was auto-report and he was reported enough times to trigger it, if your friends had Chinese characters or were typing in Chinese I could see random people reporting them as gold sellers because it‚Äôs an NA server
---
Duskwood is fun I'd wait till you're closer to 23/24 to level there though
---
 What if I use Dominos which changes the basic UI? How can I check if it is indeed on auto or not?
---
Nice. Good kill
---
But... Do you really not see how selectively choosing people results in *less* people getting into groups?
---
With reserving items, if, say, a rogue doesn't need  UBRS swords, he can still get an invite to a group with a warrior tank that wants them. If said warrior tank were selectively inviting, he would likely just never talk to that rogue.
---
You just have to get over the FOMO "feels-bad" aspect of reserved items. I 100% don't experience that feels-bad-ness, so I'm not really sure what to say here.
---
For 95% of the lifetime of Vanilla WoW that is the only reason people ran Live Strat.  But I was blessed to have a helpful guild when I played Vanilla, so yes we did tons of Live Strat run just to farm orbs for particular people, who in turn repaid the favour helping you at other points.
---
gnomes are great if you're picking up engineering.
---
Humans are just better because:
---
Better rep gains
---
Perception on top of paranoia keeps rogues and cat stealthed druids away
---
Less competition in their starting zones for questing, especially when layering goes away.
---
Not universally hated or puntable
---
cons:
---
No escape artist for pvp, but if you're on a pve server who cares.
---
0.3% less spell crit and tiny bits of mana not gained from the int bonus.
---
Global Taunt and puntable.
---
Wands don't use mana.
---
This is clearly on the bridge before princess and the pull was the pair of giants, the warrior says he only pulled 1, and then it looks like the earth elemental pat aggro'd on them.  Unless you think there are multiple princesses of which he only pulled one and that they encountered a pat while fighting her, dummy.
---
Ethically I agree, but IIRC Blizzard will only intervene if loot rules were established up front explicitly (they can pull up the chat logs)
---
Honestly I had to go look it up because I thought it could prevent charm too, lol
---
If you are serious... Blizzard has a feature in parental controls that you can set what hours you can play. Say you seriously want to cut back, you can set the time allowed to play between 6PM and 9PM.
---
C O N S U M E
---
kek, in italics
---
As soon as you cast fortitude it breaks the MC. No way to avoid this as far as im aware. Also if the mobs hes fighting are friendly to you and you MC him itll remove him from combat. Also any threat generated by a MC'd pawn gets transfered to you when the MC breaks.
---
Hope this helps!
---
As a side note i havent had any difficulties MCing horde off the boat. Though its definitley a dick move, so try to keep it to a minimum =P
---
Comparing druids resorting to running away as their ONLY form of combat because they are so unequivocally weak is NOT the same thing as a fighter avoiding hits..... lol??????
---
A better comparison would be the boxer running around the ring throwing wiffleballs until the opponent got knocked out lmao
---
PuGs should be made aware if any loot will be reserved, so they can make an informed decision whether to participate in that run. 
---
If you're a PuG joining a partial guild run or a full-blown PuG run, don't be afraid to ask for the RL to state the loot rules before the run begins. Screenshot it if they do. If they refuse to state the loot rules, you should probably leave.
---
weren't the private servers, nost, elysium, and lights hope typically popping around 12k without layers? they didn't seem too congested to me
---
How did you get that set? bought it from the AH?  or did you farm the reagents yourself ? I just transitioned (I'm lvl 41) and have been struggling to get SP.
---
Why does shadow shadow trance only work if you cancel your current cast and re-cast? Am I doing something wrong?
---
7.5 days. 1 day played at 60
---
Is it not a 15 man now?  That is kind of a bummer.
---
Bruh 30-35 ain't super good. Id prefer 50 if o could swing it
---
What's the peaceful music at the very start?
---
In guilds, sure. Pugging those last 1 or few people usually involved reserves depending on who was there. Most people are smart enough and kind enough to announce at reserves at a prudent point so as not to lose someone Midway through an instance. I am reading a lot of stories about dumb dumbs not announcing reserves until inopportune moments. It's just silly, if true. 
---
So yes, reserves existed and were common,  you just had less social media to bitch about your unpleasant experiences. 
---
Just communicate.
---
check your ah, it will depend on the server. I saw someone say the sold one for 500g. BiS for tanking druid.
---
Literally the opposite of what this guy said - 200g minimum - BiS pre-raid druid tanking weapon.
---
Not putting Fear on Q
---
Yeah i was level 24 lol i had unfinished dungeon quests and was bummed when i had noticed i was wasting time besides picking up the hides lol thank you!!!
---
Honestly, I do actually agree with you (off "meta" specs are just fine in raids b/c dps requirements to clear bosses are so low).  However, the argument then becomes "wait, why do I have to heal when that guy gets to DPS....I wanna dps, too"
---
This is definitely handy! Thank you you‚Äôre awesome!
---
Layering and sharding are two different things, with very different goals.
---
Sharding is artificially depopulating zones so that the server can handle the load, especially since zones can hold players from other realms for you to play with. The goal of sharding is for server resources.
---
Layering is continent-wide instances that hold the world in it because Blizzard wants to increase the total population cap of a server. The purpose of this is to avoid opening more realms to handle the amount of people and having many dead realms a few months after launch, and instead they would just remove layering and players can log into the same world as before, just with more players.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Retail WoW is not about identity and reputation. Classic WoW is about being part of a server community and having a reputation in there. Whether it's your own reputation or the reputation of a shitty guild. You know who they are and will run into them again. Sharding has zero identity, since you're just pulling players from other realms. Layering has individual identity because you'll recognize players in your layer if you pay attention. And when they remove layering, this will be true for all players on the realm.
---
Snackybox and Ly you're on my kill list &gt;:)
---
Just let them die after you let them know you‚Äôre drinking and they will learn fast.
---
Agreed and more than that I am off the opinion that one should not reserve loot at all when random people are invited in. I have in the past pretty much left groups on the spot who do that. Now RL may ask if its okay and then usually I have no problem - like sure it's okay. But this behaviour is utterly unaccaptable in my books. everyone is putting effort in and everyone should have equal chances unless requested &amp; agreed in advance.
---
My main just hit level 30 after a month.... But then, my alt list is rather large (8) and some of those are high teens/early twenties.
---
Me too which is why as soon as I get home I'll be leveling my warrior or druid
---
Old Gods classic+ confirmed
---
&gt; "My dps is Waaay more important than your mana" 
---
I would have laughed his ass right out of the party
---
As someone who started in MoP, my favourite specs (aside from all rogue specs) are: ret pally, balance druid, and shadow priest. I guess my altoholism will be cured in Classic. /shrug
---
I honestly believe it's just a fad and bad behavior that has to get stomped out socially, the whole point was in classic your personal/guild reputation matters. Personally, I hope master loot stays. For every one of these 'incidents' there are dozens if not hundreds of good ones happening.
---
If someone is reserving and charging ya that's fucked but I'm full prebis excluding a 1000g item and have mc pieces. I'm not tanking dungeons unless I can get a damn orb or am paid or it's in my guild. Otherwise what's the incentive to going into a dungeon with people I dont know when I need nothing.... not much. The situations you and i are talking about are different.
---
If you need it, you need it.  If the first thing you are going to do with it is get rid of it, you don't need it.  That's just my opinion and pretty aligned with my current experiences.  Though I tend to avoid to trade chat pugs as much as possible.
---
I liked when the droo bear getting feared made a Bantha sound? I dunno
---
"Your next Shadow Bolt becomes an instant cast spell."  
---
If you are already casting something, the the next Shadow Bolt you are cast will be instant. So, if you are already casting SB when it procs, then the net one will be instant. If you are spamming it, you will appear to cast both at the same time.
---
First character is always caps so this isn't Lbs for pounds it's Ibs for irritable bowel syndrome. Have run a couple instances with this guy on Herod and specifically asked.
---
Nooo, no buddy they're low.
---
Yeah i had read that greyed out meant that you still get exp, but that just meant dungeon quests exp and not actual mob kills haha!
---
Lol nice. That's a long walk back from the graveyard too.
---
Wait why does it change then?  I didn't know this and gave it up already
---
The higher ranks just scale better?
---
How many people are spamming "LF1M need rogue then g2g?" 
---
None?
---
There is a reason tanks feel entitled to reserve loot. It's called supply and demand, and you can agree with it or not, but can we stop with this fantasy that you as a DPS are as valuable as a tank or healer? You're not. You're replaceable. Sorry.
---
The elementals in arathi highlands drop charms used for warrior whirlwind axe quest, depending on server they may sell for a pretty penny if you can find an ideal time to farm them. On my server the thundering and creating charms are worth about 50s-80s each, the burning charms are much less however.
---
What server because I think I may have been that rogue if this was recently haha also yeah..  as someone who treats BB like Org, I always wished that boat went BB-Rachet- Steam Port.
---
And she's still around???  Marry her!  LOL
---
Bis pre-raid, raid, and all of classic
---
Does spirit affect mage evocate?
---
You think a casual player is going to wait for something to be game breaking before switching to another game? If the game allows a raid to camp players in a way that makes their death guaranteed with zero chance of fighting back and the only solution is a spirit rez, casuals will just laugh it off while closing wow and playing something else. 
---
It's one thing engaging in open world pvp or getting ganked, it's another to be honor fodder for people who take the game seriously enough to camp flight masters, which is only slightly more engaging than landing on a flight master and instantly dying.
---
They deserve it. Most of my bad experiences at level 60 and below were because of a moron mage who had no idea what he was doing
---
It's not about spread. If they wanted to spread players out, they could have done sharding. Layering is about keeping a healthy server population, even for "low" servers by merging their layers when a large part of the players leave. That way they avoid server merges somewhat soon after launch.
---
Yeah, was just exemplifying how different classes have different perks. And the tank classes is they can negotiate from a stronger vantage point.
---
even worse, if you get killed, a smart priest/warlock/druid can basically gank you until they get bored, without any real chance of retaliation. 
---
just needs a macro with something like "/cast Shadow Word: Pain [rogue's name]", bind it to some easily spammable key (say, mouse wheel), and... well, spam it until the rogue resurrects. it will hit him before just as he rises, denying any chance of stealth.
---
Git gud
---
I'm so glad I play on RP-PVP. I've seen very little of this kind of stuff so far.
---
What aspects did you find rough at first? I'm definitely interested to hear what the experience is like for new players.
---
You didn't, but others did. Reddit is weird sometimes. I hope you can manage to get the money together for your mount soon. :)
---
Literally just have to log out.
---
I've definitely used Magic Dust. Not sure about the net.
---
Because as an undead warrior and artisan smith, warlocks are the absolute easiest class for me to kill. Between the BS trinket, zerker rage, and WotF, you're pretty much immune to fear.

If they‚Äôre spamming for hours they‚Äôre doing it wrong or offering nothing in return. A competent tank/healer duo has plenty of leverage to offer a run with some reserved loot and plenty of DPS will agree to go on that run because they have many other pieces of loot they need, and DPS classes are plentiful. You‚Äôre more than welcome to avoid such groups but there is a demand for them.
---
He wasn't outside of the 5 second rule, and I would say that the vast majority of evo usage is going to happen while they  aren't taking advantage of it. But also: " While channeling this spell, ***your mana regeneration is active*** and increased by 1500%. Lasts 8sec". 5 second rule doesn't apply to evocation.

My warlock will use 3 bars. Most are situational!

Be careful, recognizing the responsibility inherent in different party roles is considered elitism around here, and we don't take kindly to elitists.

You don't move layers except by grouping or switching to another continent.

I‚Äôm a level 40 warrior with 50G, how can I farm gold to get a mount ASAP? I farmed SM for a few hours but didn‚Äôt get much.
---
yup, and I have to keep summoning either the suc or my void to help pick up mobs because the tank can't keep up, when i'd rather have my imp out for the health bonus.
---
10vs1? seems about right :)
---
I thought the warlock lvl 40 steed was just a simple quest / skill while the lvl 60 one was basically just as hard as farming 1000g for an epic mount.
---
Lazy and not wanting to find a way to deal with their shitty "dynamic" spawning. Quest mobs are already difficult to find. They are probably waiting till more of the pops are 60.
---
I've also had a lot of great community interactions, though. OP, someone commented (a little harsher than I would) that sometimes you've got to drive those interactions. That can be very exhausting--especially if those kinds of interactions and driving those kinds of interactions aren't skillsets or strengths of yours--or life giving to you. Worth it, ultimately, but exhausting.
---
It's super hard, especially in an online environment, just like you've observed. Some people are really terrible to each other online because its "safe". No one can see your face or call you out, really, when you're hidden behind a screen, so it's easier to be a complete jackass. Sorry you've got to deal with that. You will also find good people, though, and I hope that you do.
---
Sorry for the double post, I deleted the other response because I feel like it's more applicable here:
---
I'm Alliance on Stalagg and we still have a fair group of real life friends there. I'd love to see you and your friend stick it out; we're way outnumbered, no doubt, but the only way the alliance makes a come-back is by sticking up for our lower levels and banding together.
---
As another comment mentioned, those of us that are left seem to be fairly good at the game and seem mostly helpful to each other. This isn't all good, because I personally had new friends that quit due to how much they were getting ganked, but by level 30 you're just about in the worst of it (gets slightly better in the 40s, 50s have been actually fairly forgiving in the plaguelands - I think horde either started to realize the imbalance or are hyper-focused on reaching 60 themselves.)
---
If you choose to stay, feel free to shoot me a message if you need any help - name is Mithra, I'm a 58 Paladin. We're actually recruiting, too, but no worries if you're already in a guild or if joining a guild isn't really your thing.
---
In the essence of full disclosure, you can go through my previous comments and see me complaining about server balance. In those comments, I link a census mod that shows what it has gathered in terms of population balance across factions and servers. I'm not 100% certain on accuracy, but it probably gives a fairly realistic representation of server balance.
---
But they just did it to you...so yeah they deserve something equally back for wasting your time.
---
It might affect the super large population servers like Faerlina, but generally it would be expected they would remove layering when most servers have around 3000-9000 population. Blizzard themselves said that most servers have low single digit layers, which would be 1-4 layers. With layers being 3,000 players big, that means servers currently are about like 1000 to 12,000 players, depending on the server.
---
I don't know the amount of layers on Faerlina, but it could be something like 7 layers to support 21,000 players simultaneously, but I honestly think it's like 4 since Blizzard would be moronic to do that if they want to remove layering.
---
There is a guy on our server (Herod) who already has a bad reputation for this because he and his guild got a PUG together for Onyxia and didn't announce what was reserved until right before the pull. Only a handful of people left.
---
Desolace is the place to be. I did all of 30-40 with zero STV. Did Desolace, Arathi, and enough Sm to get the items I wanted.
---
As a warlock, I havent done this because I literally do not understand how mana tapping your health away is beneficial. It's not! You drink! Thats why there are drinks in the game! For me, the minute I enter a dungeon or group, I try to give my healthstones to everyone. You wouldn't believe how many people of all roles I have to basically force it on them. It's free health! Free! And I also ask about where they would like my SS placed; a good deal of people ignore me! So I either put it on the tank or healer, if if they're rude, on me! I bring enough Spul Shards into each dungeon so I can give everyone (including me) a healthstone, soul stone someone and have a back up for SS, and then 3 extra shards just waiting in my bag. It takes up a lot of space and sometimes I leave the dungeon at the end sad, because all those people wouldnt even take a healthstone. For free!!
---
I've actually been told it's better from pure dps perspective
---
Have they spoken at all on when the phases are being released?
---
That‚Äôs the threshold I usually use but needing warden staff when you have a bear tank in the group apparently doesn‚Äôt fall under this code.
---
The raid icons are in the regular keybind menu, you just have to assign them
---
Not horde.
---
Or they don't need an item you do so it doesn't matter. I've never cared about res runs, don't join if it doesn't fit your criteria. If I start a group then I can res what I want, if people don't join then tough luck for me.
---
Is egin worth leveling up? Kinda want to drop herb for it. What kind of stats does those googles give?
---
Also interested!
---
I really do believe him. My friend says he is so broke he has always had to trade gold for wow tokens in the past. He can barely afford his subscription let alone buying gold.
---
hahaha
---
how TF did you afford warden staff at 43? it's like 500G, at the low end
---
Valid, but that is as much a problem of the heals/other DPS not respecting a member of their group as it is the table reserving items.
---
I feel like a group that would do that would jump on a tank that was advertising his own LFG with reserve whether he contacted them or not.
---
It's a pug so you follow rolls. It's pretty much just that simple. In a full guild run you can use loot council or dkp or whatever rules you want to ensure fairness, but there is no feasable way to determine if someone "deserves" the loot in a single run that everyone will agree with, so the only thing you can do is just roll for it and accept the outcome regardless of what it is.
---
Never got an answer
---
Prices are low for multifaceted reasons. Layering increases mob denisty, more people killing more mibs equals more loot.  I was able to flip an item fairly early but niw its destroyed. Gotta wait, farm cash and buy before it flattens out
---
f
---
I bought them on the AH because I was impatient and I had the gold to spare, they weren't super expensive. If you're in a decently large guild then you can probably get a guildie to make it for you if you have the materials.
---
As for looking for spellpower gear, red mageweave pants are a fairly inexpensive source you can find on the AH. [You can use wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/items/min-req-level:35/max-req-level:50/side:2/class:7/quality:2:3?filter=123;2;1#items:0+3+19) to find other sources of spellpower around your level to be looking out for in quests and such.
---
Actually that level is 38. That is when you get rank 4 drain life.
---
Create your own group then. I personally do not do this, but the reason these runs exist is because people are so lazy that they don't want to take 10 minutes to make a macro and then spam for people...
---
Drain life with the talents gives you much more life than it‚Äôs mana cost. So you get &gt;1 health per 1 mana. 
---
Plus you get damage. If doing single mobs, i‚Äôm always at full hp at the end of each kill, I tap and dark part as necessary while pulling the next mob and heal back up to full. 
---
It‚Äôs a bit harder, but no downtime and more dps. Plus succubus is better for pvp pre 60 when no one really has a counter for seduce, especially if you are on horde side.
---
Yup the level 40 quest is just a turn in I believe. The adventure was questing through these zones and finally hitting 40 after playing whenever we could between work and life etc.
---
Skill floor =/= skill ceiling. Like I said in my last post: Learn. To. Read. (:
---
Combat rogues ganking is the funniest shit ever.
---
‚ÄúPeople are never happy about loot reservation... even if it‚Äôs an item they don‚Äôt need.‚Äù Right there in your OP. My question has simply been why the hell is reserving an item ahead of time that you don‚Äôt need a big deal? You don‚Äôt need it so why does not being able to roll for it bother you?
---
Now as far as don‚Äôt group with those people... why don‚Äôt you do the same? Why an entire thread ranting on tanks that reserve gear? Cause it‚Äôs hard to avoid right? So is grouping up with randoms that need on shit they don‚Äôt need.
---
Correct. It means that if you deal 100 dmg in battle stance, you generate 80 threat. If you switch to def stance, you only deal 90 dmg, but generate 135 threat.
---
Druids can pop instant cast engineering items like sappers, use health potions and healthstones, and other utility potions via the use of a powershifting macro. This is no longer a downside.
---
it would be nice if there was a ‚Äùmore options‚Äù that would list like the top 3 items instead of just the bis
---
Oooff. Still havnt found an epic in open world... Played All expansions except WoD......... Rip
---
Yeah, it just gets a whole lot better with higher ranks
---
since when is AR bis all game like warden staff is?
---
seems you need to read up on facts before using false statements for an discussion
---
I ask my healer straight up in the beginning if they are okay with me tapping myself to death between pulls, cause at the high end they can get me to like 80% hp with a sneeze of mana. Mid fight I'm judging enemy hp left, threat, and the healers mana to decide whether I should tap and keep shadowbolting, or just wand, or life drain and manage myself. If I die, I die, not the healers fault at all.
---
But man, soul stoning yourself and hellfire on single mobs?
---
What a Karen.
---
The priveleges of playing a desired class, you can charge for services.
---
Ehhh wotmate?
---
I cant be low level if I havent even jumped on classic yet.  Still busy enjoying the new expansion in FFXIV, you know with boss fights that are actually challenging üòÇ
---
Honestly the bitching and general toxicity of this sub are not making me look forward to jumping back into Azeroth.
---
Druids dont tank raids tho
---
Sure. Learning to manage your VW has the added advantage of being able to tank the previous 5 man content as you level. Nice for helping friends and guild mates. But as I said already, drain tanking is fine and people should try it if they're interested. VW leveling is also fine depending on your preference.
---
There are loads of people who wait till 60 to level proffessions. I have seen dust sell for insane prices because those people now have money to spend.
---
S'okay, you didn't know is all!
---
uhh... faerie fire?
---
Look up utilitarianism please... I dont think you quite get what I‚Äôm implying. 
---
I‚Äôm fully known with utility, and this has nothing to do with the ethical problems in the different looting etiquettes. But that‚Äôs not all there is to it. 
---
There‚Äôs no system in which players have ‚Äúagreed upon‚Äù in pugs lol. Just watch these threads and read the responds, see how they differ in vast directions. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way. 
---
I‚Äôm not really bitching about anything? You completely missed the entire point of this post. 
---
I‚Äôm counter arguing some of the statements being made, and I find it interesting how people describe what‚Äôs fair. Also people have different opinions, but you might not be aware.
---
Yes I had this thought too. Either prejudice against Chinese in NA or Blizzard confusing them for gold farmers based on their IP or perhaps the VPN that maybe Chinese gold farmers use as well.
---
The answers here are correct 300-600g
---
Unfortunate. I really wanted Epic Mount by 60. But BIS is too crucial.
---
I'm the opposite of this warlock, i bring food and water and always feel guilty when a priest heals me when im in no danger
---
Your argument doesn't work because vendor price doesn't reflect an item's value, whereas trade price does.
---
If u have more hp u are harder to kill. Because you have more hp
---
yea, they don't even have to buy the earlier level posions to buy the high level ones later one like normal skills.
---
All you have to do is join the discord. Then also play the game and it's obvious.
---
It's not about taming the pets, it's about sending a message.

What is the role of a Warlock in ZF farm groups? Pulling mobs with eye or void? Then hellfire?

How much is a monthly sub where you live? What does that equal in US dollars?

How could you say that?!
---
Yup. I enjoyed crafting my own list for shaman heals actually but it is a fair bit of work.
---
The easiest way to get the best of both worlds is to put the bid price 1s below the vendor price. Lots of people use addons to pick that stuff up and will put a bid on it. The buyout price can be fair market value. That way you get the benefit of selling it for more than vendor price, but if not you don't lose much either.
---
PvP videos have come a long way since vanilla.
---
It looks good on ally maybe you shouldnt have rolled horde
---
I wish WoW had more choices like that, where you could pick which groups you want to side with, not in the "I want different flavor buffs a la Aldor vs Scryer" but rather like, choosing to side between factions that make some actual impact.

A nice example is the paladin pimp robe that currently like 90% of all holy paladins wear. Is it BIS? Yes. Barely. But for a fairly hard to get item from baron thats absolute shit in PvP and looks ridiculous? Get Red dragon scale breastplate. Mail, looks decent or can be hidden under shirt and tabard and gives almost as much healing power. Sadly the int is missing. But if your putting an expensive enchant on it and plan to do PvP? Forget about the robes. How do you get it? I picked mine up for 40g in the AH. Dirt cheap. 
---
 I wouldn't consider Icy Veins or wowhead good. At least for Holy Paladins. Better one would be this:

With at least three options for every slot you've got everything from 500g super-rare from AH to stuff you pick up during leveling or for 10g from the AH

Maybe mention your class and specc and someone can point you in the right direction.
---
Sounds right to me. Thanks!
---
Me too man... me too...
---
Big brain bait
---
Don't run in those groups. If they dont state the res, they just wont invite anyone who could use it. There's no end to this. If someone wants an item, they will find the easiest way to get it.
---
Because everyone's doing it. Just go into your servers LFG chat and see how many UBRS group advertisements you see without a reservation. It's fine, we just have a difference of opinion. I've played this game for 15 years and I've never seen this meta pop up until classic level 60. And I think it's mirrored off streamers doing so, so people think they can do the same, and I think it's on average leading to less groups for more players.
---
The only thing that looks good on Alliance is 6 feet of dirt.
---
Right but if you remove layers while keeping the same megaserver sizes then you get way more crowding than we ever experienced in vanilla, so its not going to feel the same as it was.

Yeah, I got tore up one side and down the other in thread cause I am an apparent douche for using trying in earnest to let someone know that it is possible to completely avoid "unlucky" and "random aggro".
---
If they had said it when the party was formed that would be one thing but to do it in the middle of the first pull? That's scumbag tactics, they are trying to use the sunk-cost phenomenon to get people to stay in conditions they wouldn't otherwise tolerate.
---
Hey, I resemble that remark.
---
That just seems like a bunch of extra steps to reserve an item
---
My friend‚Äôs English isn‚Äôt good enough to translate the original ban email for me sufficiently. So I wasn‚Äôt able to see what info or proof blizz has... but even after the appeal they offer nothing more than saying they are right.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong: The Scarlet Crusade are basically the Scientology of WoW?
---
Some people get paid to tank even when they do get to roll on loot. His point wasn‚Äôt just about this specific situation of schemey party members.
---
Because its just a game and not your second life.
---
What
---
Wasn't even the middle of the pull, it was before a trash pull. Just put in a quick "brb" or something... why is that so hard?
---
This is why I play Kitty.
---
Why do people say this stupid shit? Horde and alliance both have dumb pricks who ruin the game for other people. Don't lump everyone together.
---
what's the plugin that let's you see real-time health changes?
---
Lmfao, thats pretty much how it feels.
---
I was running doing a strat dead run last night and our priest was ooming really fast on the fight and after getting everyone repaired to 100% and getting him pots i asked that we wait an additional 5 minutes for recklessness cd so we can garuntee our success.
---
They doubted me, said we'll be fine and that we should just go ahead. I insisted that we went to much length to just get repaired and get pots an extra 5 min for my cd is small in the scheme of things.
---
They knew not of my power, and the warlock apologized after we killed baron, "im sorry i doubted you and your damage".
---
Never doubt the dps of recklessness.
---
Not everything goes in the AH some items between there vendors price and AH cut or reposting deposit fees sometimes it‚Äôs better to vendors some items opposed to AH also skinning makes a steady trickle of money coming in and so does mining with so many more people doing engineering in classic compared to vanilla. I‚Äôd say mining is more of a money maker right now than herbs.  Any other profs are more of a cost than a miner maker.
---
Run MC shit drops from fuckin every mob
---
Why can‚Äôt the new 60 make their own groups?
---
They can offtank and potentially maintank most fights once the content is on farm just fine.
---
I've been feeding it cooked longjaw mud snappers. I'm only level 14 at the moment so I felt like that should be good enough.
---
It's not a fad, this is a mentally straight outta pservers where finding a group was much harder due to population. Now if your dals don't drop you can be in another ubrs in five minutes. People just need to take a breath and slow down.
---
Finale the best
---
But any player who is feels excluded due to reservations can just make his own group. Hes not locked out of anything
---
Yeah. It's those same people that rage against the concept of BiS gear, and that dole it condescending dismissals when a newbie who cares asks for a comparison between classes and races. "You do you, don't let anyone tell you different!!!!!!"
---
Almost forgot I still had that in my back pocket lol.
---
You‚Äôre a super good tank, 39 other people will see how good of a tank you are. I‚Äôll tell everyone on my friends list how good you are. I‚Äôll even post it on Reddit :)
---
First we need to figure out how to access world chat... then we can be invited and switch layers at will.
---
Looks like the old carbonite addon.
---
So it would probably be better to sell it a month or two from now when there are more 60s with epic mounts looking for their bis? Since it wont really stop being bis?
---
You sit on a throne of lies
---
As a warrior I like to do this too. But actually it‚Äôs because I just fought a mob 3 levels lower than me and need a breather and I am not engaging in world pvp until pvp trinket comes out
---
My argument is that theyre worth the same in value.
---
Wait, wait, wait -- are you demorphing to cast thorns at the start of each battle?? Or am I blindly missing that I can Thorn while in Bear form?

I agree with that. Its like Milton from Office Space politely asking for cake and everyone ignoring him until there's no more cake left. Starting polite and nice is a must, but there's no need to be a doormat no matter what mflood says. Doormats are as productive as asshats.
---
100g worth of stuff now when you have 0g is worth a lot more than 200g in a few months when you have epic mount and 3000g.

---
Although I don't think Destruction plays very much like a fire mage, aside from being more of a direct caster (less emphasis on DoTs). The rest of the Warlock's toolkit is so deep and varied, that it's significantly more varied than that of a mage. 
---
Something as simple as summoning a different demon completely alters how you play the class.
---
at first i thought the art style is too crude, but now i actively look forward to these posts.  Please dont stop, your public demands more!

That joke is time period appropriate.
---
professions are the ultimate trap
---
Does anyone have a link to any good leveling references for locks? I‚Äôm talking like a guide or google sheet or something. Thanks :)
---
Its about as close as a shadow priest is to a mage. Its very different in PvP, which you use your brain with compared to PvE. As stated previously, raids are all pretty much 1-2 button specs with most classes anyways. But seriously there is maybe no other class that is more fleshed out in terms of the lore and feel of the class like a warlock.
---
I have no life so i don't have to deal with this.
---
There are players willing to spec and gear in the most efficient way possible to clear a raid, and there are players who insist on playing a meme spec.  Most people, especially those who choose to spec and gear efficiently themselves, would rather group with the former.
---
I think purposely choosing a bad spec like Shadow, especially for progression raiding (like the first couple MC/Ony runs) is a pretty selfish waste of everyone else‚Äôs time and energy.  Sure, it doesn‚Äôt make the raid impossible to clear, but every little bit helps.
---
I liken it to playing with half my gear on to save on repair bills.  In a 40-person raid the different isn‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs still a selfish way to play.
---
Agree, roll and move on. The important stuff isn't until endgame and last time I played classic, we had dungeon points so that everyone had a fair shot at items.
---
oh my god, you're right--[here is what I see](https://i.imgur.com/y5FwUGa.jpg)

Oh fuck, dude. That‚Äôs way too relatable. Hopefully you‚Äôve gotten better since that.

---
Nah, there would be tanks sitting around the capital bank offering tanking services from vanilla through wrath.  
---
The tanks charging are likely content being turned down and leveling fishing or something instead.  The ones back in the day were fine just sitting in org or stormwind.
---
Just a guild with some close m8s of mine from outside the game. Hello from kromcrush &lt;goons&gt; though
---
Meta exists basically in all games nowadays.  There will always be a more efficient way to play a game.  We can't really stop a meta from forming in classic.  We can however, is inform enough people over time that the difficulty in Classic isn't about pushing top numbers, just yielding 40 breathing bodies so you can just play what you want.  Its odd to see top streamers playing the "meme" specs and always telling the stream how it doesn't matter, yet the streaming community viewership wise is "x spec is trash".  Esfand plays Ret, Shroud and Cdew rocking enhance, yet we still seeing "must play meta spec to raid" thought from the community.  Streamers are actually doing 20 man ony raids with Enhance, Spriest, kitty dps, and everyone still thinks "only mages are useful".  The community embraced the spellcleave meta (for better or worse, likely worse) from streamers, but ignore the non-meta specs that are often used on stream.  Just funky to see.
---
not even close but okay
---
Ret most of the way. You could level holy but because the first 30-40 levels dungeons dont really need you to be a pure spec to heal. In fact not until very late in the game does it matter. 
---
Even if you plan to level someone, like a warrior.
---
huh?
---
I've never seen so many entitled players before.
---
Leave your guildie be.

This situation is incredibly shitty. It's my fear as a druid tank.

I really need that staff. If it dropped and everyone needed I'd be pissed too.

But this is why from now on i will specify that all gear, bop or boe, is reserved for those who usethe gear.

Had a really nice pair of leather boe boots drop with huge stam. I was the druidtank. I didnt get them.
---
Gear is gear IMO. It's not a chest to roll on. 
---
But if the party agreedto roll on boe then that's that. Just like me with my boots.
---
I had someone complain about grabbing a gathering quest node that I was literally fighting one of the 2 guys guarding it (the guy pulled the other after I started the fight)
---
The guy then complained non stop as I got a few more, which I gathered by killing the only mob guarding them while he complained.
---
Tired of his bs I pulled a bunch of mobs and let them kill me next to him, resulting in him getting killed by them.
---
After us running back to our and rezzing, there was a moment of silence, and then he left. Blew him a kiss as he left.
---
If you're gunna be toxic about me being "toxic" despite being in the right, I'll actually be toxic in retaliation.
---
Totally true. Those robes kill me. And the lists definitely inflate/depress prices. I‚Äôve made a lot of gold by reselling items like Mass of Gowan off the AH. People check their lists, see it‚Äôs not listed then sell it for 30g. Once people see that many BiS items are incredibly rare they notice that there are great alternatives. It‚Äôs weird.
---
I‚Äôve already got a phase by phase BiS list for acceptable items (elemental shaman). But many of the items I‚Äôm gathering I didn‚Äôt find listed as options.
---
So lead in to the fight is: unmorph, pull with some damage spell, HOT myself while mob rushes me, Thorns, then Bear
---
Busy, but could be fun!
---
Man I went on a murder spree over there the other day because I was tired of getting my mobs poached.
---
If anyone reading this got jumped by a Shaman for seemingly no reason, that was me, my bad.
---
Horde scum.
---
I mean, I disagree - a priest might actually want to equip [Felstriker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12590/felstriker) but that doesn‚Äôt mean they should get to need on it. 
---
To me the loot system isn‚Äôt to shunt loot toward people who can equip the loot, it‚Äôs to shunt loot toward whoever gets the most value out of the loot. And the default need vs. greed dialog is never gonna be perfect as far as that goes - but for BoEs where the value to each person is roughly the market price of the item, I think everyone should get a fair shot at the item.
---
I was doing echeyakee with guy I met, killed him and went to redeem. Can redeem because I didn't start the fire, had to run back and start the fire then run and I left someone with 2 echeyakee.
---
Dang dude, congrats on figuring out what anyone who spent any time with a bear tank knows already!
---
Make sure not to listen to the echo chamber as much next time :)
---
thats not a bad price considering you can easily charge 50g right now per enchant. you could potentially make that back in a week, or save your guild a ton of gold.
---
Yeah, that's why I've been waiting to start it til I hit 60 and could put a lot of time into it. My logic is mostly just that people were downing these raids the first week, so I bet we can play with more spriests and boomkins than what the "ideal raid comp" dictates
---

Stopping Alliance players from transferring won't work. All you'll do is make more Horde on another server.  I was on Kirtonos, 3rd worst in terms of faction imbalance(Skeram was no.2, Stalagg is no.1). The faction imbalance hurt more than just wPvP. I was on the fence about transferring until a BRD group I was in spent 20+ minutes spamming LFG and lookingforgroup for a 3rd dps. We had a tank, we had heals(me), but we struggled to find a 3rd dps. That coupled with the fact that it multiple Horde guilds cleared MC a full week before our first(and only of that week). We literally couldn't even dungeon grind. The imbalance left the Alliance on that server anemic. It was almost like I was being punished for wanting to play a bit hard core. For some reason the transfer option was removed when I went to try (it was back a few days later). So, I just rerolled as Horde on another server (my thought was that if I was going to do it, I'd better do it as soon as possible, rip the band-aid off now. Either do that or just quit, which I almost did).  BTW, I had most of my pre-raid BiS as well, so I gave that up, too.  
---
That's all you'll accomplish by trying to lock players of one faction to a server. Rerolls or cancellations.
---
I like it. 
---
I might have needed a macro when I was back in HS and types like 20 WPM, but nowadays after years of dedicating myself to computers it takes a blink of an eye to type brb and /f the closest person.
---
I liked, commented, and subscribed. This is gold. 10/10 will watch a few dozen more times.
---
&gt; Im Talking about people who sell so low that no one profits even a single copper from it bc they have no clue
---
Then target a different segment of the market?  Let them undercut to the point where they are selling at a loss and then buy to vendor?
---
Savvy players find a way to make a profit.  Stash items/mats that are expected to increase in value?  Collect profession leveling kits and sell those at a markup since the recipient needs never go to the AH to level the kit?
---
I'd be leery of trying to time the market since we don't really know what prices are likely to do beyond certain approximations (more people will reach max level, more people will level professions).  Server populations could rise or fall and both of those can influence prices/supply levels.
---
? The Horde are majority players. And, they dont want to sit in the queue for a healthy population. The same would be said about Ally if they were the majority, it just happens to be Horde. So nah, it's not stupid shit.

Blizzard: ‚ÄúWanna bet how many different ways we can recycle WarCraft 3‚Äôs story?‚Äù

Lbrs 3 mage 1 tank 1 healer. Coc and ae spam you can do all packs to ogres in 12 minutes so you just avoid lockout.
---
Does anyone know an easy way to carry my UI across characters? I‚Äôm using a array of different UI addons and was wondering if I could just copy and paste my folder from character to the next or if I‚Äôll have to redo everything for each character.
---
I need to practice this more -- too many mobs rushing past me at the AOE mages.
---
I liked the video better muted..
---
Second time around it was obnoxious to me, but humor is subjective.
---
Ikr done the same with my shaman and a mage, it‚Äôs nice to look good, be competitive, and a little unique.
---
People 5 manned ony in retail classic.  I guess I am not understanding your point.  The reason people are able to achieve this stuff is by min/maxing.  Not by just bringing any class/spec with any gear
---
the lego yoda death sound rofl
---
So the rogue has honor and waited for you to finish fighting the yeti. All I see is a druid that didn't switch to bear form right away and only lived by using an HP pot back to almost full health. The rogue didn't have many other options but to go for the kill. No HP pots = dead druid.
---
https://imgur.com/Zhftahk.jpg
---
Hey not sure if you saw my reply to another guy but here is a chart to show what level you can kill and still get XP
---
Genius
---
&gt;Alliance rolling in group of 10 or more in multiple zones killing all horde they see.
---
A whole 10?! I'm sure there are more than 10 horde on your server. Ask the pvp guilds for help...
---
If they were other races they would be big shits...
---
I‚Äôve had a hell of a time finding Ubrs groups on my rogue. Everyone I know is doing it with guildies only or mid day during the week. I‚Äôm on a west coast server and I think there‚Äôs a load of east coast players right after they get off work. Bad luck, I guess. Gonna start putting together my own runs.
---
yeah, instead of making a few hundred gold now when youre dirt poor, youll make a thousand gold when that amount is totally pointless
---
Exactly my point. Everything in every video game is just a "pixel something" so trying to downplay one aspect of the pixels is just silly
---
Sure, all things equal you might pick a mage over a rogue if you want a 1h. But if you are systematically excluding players because you don‚Äôt want to share, well that‚Äôs certainly not very kind or admirable.
---
But the real entitlement comes from the justification. ‚ÄúI have run brd 30 times and you want me to let some rando come in and take it?‚Äù.
---
Essentially, I am entitled to the loot because I did all this work, and you are not because you didn‚Äôt. It is very common to overestimate your own worthiness while dismissing the worth of others.
---
People are playing like ‚Äúsome guy who just dinged 60‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been playing for 14 fucking years. It‚Äôs absurd. I understand that you put a LOT of your waking hours into this game, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve it more than the people who only(!) play 3-5 hours a day. If they are able do 5 runs a week and you a hundred, then you are already 20 times more likely to get your drop. And then you want to cut into their already slim chances because you feel like you deserve THEIR shot at the loot in addition to your own? If that isn‚Äôt entitlement...
---
Think of it this way. Imagine it‚Äôs a friend. that‚Äôs the same class. You form a group and they say Ooh! I need that dungeon too! Would you exclude them because you know they need the same loot as you? Would you choose the item over a friend and tell them to either pass on it or find another group? 
---
Well, to be trite, a stranger is just a friend you haven‚Äôt met. We are all people, and almost every single player in the game is nice and competent. If you wouldn‚Äôt treat your friend or guildie that way, you shouldn‚Äôt treat randos like that either.
---
You are misinformed. That's not how the server network works at all. Even if there were 0 layers 1 wow "server" is still spread on multiple servers anyway. A "server" is just an arbitrary partition across multiple servers working together. It's not like it was 15 years ago where each server has it's on physical space.
---
Since everyone else is talking about classes other than druids, I play a warrior. That prevents spell push back. Unless you try slamming.
---
No one thinks they should ‚Äúdecide how other people play‚Äù.  I do think I should be able to choose who I group with, though.
---
If you want to clear MC with a bunch of shadow priests and fire mages, go for it.  But don‚Äôt complain that people who are gearing and speccing according to what is best for the group don‚Äôt want to play with you.
---
I miss my chauffeur mount.
---
Lol yeah I liked the Tanaris/ZF grind as well
---
Gotta identify those 2 or 3 skills you can use to kill and forget the rest.  There's skills I still refuse to train at 60 because things like far sight are useless
---
Ah fair enough. Yeah there are exceptions, but for the most part it's like let's get this done. I've done way too many in a row without my drops. More runs more chance for my drops. Lol.
---
I tend to find the tanks that like to dilly dally instead of the ones that pull too quickly. My luck I guess.
---
Sold mine for 250g
---
Tell that to the priest who attacked me while I fishing but then received, not one, but three consecutive ass whoopings. Lol
---
There is none in Classic.
---
tailoring/leatherworking are great gold makers.
---
If you were a shadow priest.
---
CTMod maybe. Give it a try.
---
Wait a second - I'm confused.
---
They told you about the reserved loot.  What's the issue?
---
You best believe I‚Äôm tailoring groups around drops I need if that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm doing the dungeon
---
Improved Blessing of Might is generally not taken due to the minimal increase of attack power bonus and you will want to use Blessing of Wisdom while leveling anyways. Those 5 talent points are better spent elsewhere.
---
Yes, and the current best staff for it is the dancing sliver
---
But Windfury is way more fun!
---
I always play alliance.. but this is the best race / mount combo there is...specially for warriors..
---
I went around Duskwood, Elwynn, Redridge, Dun Morogh, and Westfall farming all the tin and copper ore, while skinning everything I could. I usually sold on the AH, but sometimes it's better to vendor. Just see what prices your server has for leather and ore.
---
Thanks for the quick response, appreciate all you do!
---
dude im just sittin on the couch with the keyboard on my lap and the mouse on the cushion at my side lol
---
When people see this they tend to forget you‚Äôre also getting more xp from quests and mobs as you level
---
Right!
---
Clean install of windows as last resort
---
Lose all combo points because i mousover kicked someone. Kms
---
Do you think they should be spending their time boosting you for free?
---
Some BoE blues for some classes are worth investing in, but 90% arent, especially if you wont have your mount money @ 40 lol
---
reminds me of that post here from a tauren warrior that was like level 39, had full scarlet set, but spent all of her gold on it
---
"i wont have a mount til 50 but hey i have gear that i can wear for 7 leve....oh wait i get plate at 40 too"
---
Yeah. Reward or not, I'll try to gank basically everyone I see.
---
I smell a ddos...
---
I see what you mean and I totally agree, but I think he's just talking in terms of general fight complexity.
---
Instances are pretty crap money early on. You just want to quest and kill every mob on your way (don't run past mobs even if you don't need them). Vendor everything you can't sell (and most high level greens aren't worth trying to sell tbh, except some like "of healing"/'of frozen wrath").
---
You got it! :) Will update the thread soon as I have info to share.
---
I prefer Dominoes. With OmniCC  combined with Dominos, you can see the cooldown of your spells.
---
Your joke resonates, unfortunately. He did do a stint where he declared himself homeless, and moved out and lived in downtown for I'm not sure how long (according to my parents, he was gone for over 6 months). The only thing he talks about during that experience is that he lived under a bridge, nothing else. He eventually returned to my parents house and resumed world of warcraft.
---
That was maybe 5 years ago.
---
&gt;Slow down and play the game the way I want you to play it not how you want to play it
---
Flamelash bro

What‚Äôs an addon from twitch that I can get that will auto dismount when I get to cast a spell?

---
Probably alliance because there is a &lt;Horde&gt; guild on the horde side
---
This is very reminiscent of [Verycoolguy level 8 paladin king](https://youtu.be/BUAI6ABS3-U)
---
Haha only a select few would notice that
---
Something I thought of myself and it ended up looking cool imo I guess haha
---
Yeah, they exist to sac. They aren't even good mob tanks.
---
Say it louder for the people in the back
---
Why do you think the whole world cares your name got reported?

I really regret rolling gnome because I have been camped for many hours just because I exist.
---
Is it [PerlClassic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/perl-classic-unit-frames)? I was watching a streamer who I'm pretty sure had this exact same UI and that's what she said she was using.
---
That was EXTREMELY scummy of them. There is no way anyone should get any pug in without letting them know before they join the raid that there are reserves. Which, btw, is scummy in itself. I hate reserves and guilds that do that. If a pug is what you need to even attempt a boss, they should have every right to all loot just like anyone else. 
---
The second thing I would say is make sure and ask if there are reserves before you begin - something I am sure you will do from now on.  ;)
---
Excellent, thank you!
---
Rattlegore also went down but just for a minute or two
---
what is greekgodx doing here
---
Kinda, Death Coil is short term CC though.  Still great (until it pulls something)
---
But can you just change it back?
---
It's not hard, but it's 100x more of a pain in the ass to do multiple partial BRD runs plus that hour-long escort.
---
I remember I applied for a guild in BC that was very cutting edge. And they let me run BT with them once. I was topping damage meters, but I had a spellfire set with no stamina and they told me they needed me to get gear with more stamina before they'd invite me. I remember the first boss in BT was especially hard for me with my low health having ass.
---
Gonna be frquenting this...been wanting it to.
---
Respect mate, appreciate the support :D
---
Instead of farming and saving, you could buy them now and sell later. Same thing in the end, except you don't have a dead profession.
---
Remember that we've got the benefit of 1.12 talents here. Try pre-1.6 stuff out and then you'll know what a sub-optimal spec is like lol
---
Try owlkin beasts northeast of that inn in winterspring, everlook is it? Easy minimum 20g/hour with no special drops as aage
---
Actually, you too could be best friends. ^^
---
Legend!
---
Darn I'm on Whitemane.
---
People don't think the prices are low because of layering - people just understand the prices are going to skyrocket when they remove layering in P2.
---
I imagine you could probably do a macro for this?
---
You have gotten ahead of the curve; you‚Äôre complaining about people complaining about people complaining. Good job!
---
I've walked past alliance warriors doing their quests, I've charged in and saved alliance warriors who are about to die, and they've done the same for me. Just a couple hours ago, one of these alliance warriors who didn't care about me at all at first, decided to charge me as I was fighting a mob. I hit him with intimidating shout, potted and bandaged while he was feared, and killed him in a couple seconds.
---
I spit on players like that. I'm pretty sure it was the same human warrior who killed me when I was at 10% in Arathi, scumbag.
---
Classic has made me hate the alliance so much, that my own character select screen in retail disgusts me.
---
Yep. They did on private servers. It works just fine. High pop areas will lag. World pvp will lag. People who play on the trendy servers will second guess their decisions and blizz will let people xfer.
---
Does what I said sound like a complaint? It wasn't.
---
Lets be real.  What you did wasn't half as difficult as the real thing, and none of your false projections will change that.  I hope you enjoy your participation prize.
---
Thank you! Since I am a night elf, I've been through Teldrassil, and now Darkshore, will probably do Ashenvale and other nelf zones too. But I will try to herb and skin as much as possible and check AH prices before vendoring. Thanks. =)
---
That kid deserved his repair bills.

---
We're used to getting ganked and camped constantly. I still haven't went full Red Is Dead mode because I only level in dungeons now due to how much time I've lost due to being camped but it's coming.
---
If there is a YouTube account behind these videos, I‚Äôd binge watch them all. Hilarious!!!
---
Luna frames!
---
Probably just a karma grab and that's why he won't share info.
---
Lmfao that ending though
---
How does a level 28 show up as a skull to another level 28?
---
Is kill list an in game mechanic? Or just a list of usernames you keep on your own to mow down later?
---
Also everyone is trying to make money on the AH. Back in 2004 a majority of players would have vendored most of what the picked up. Now everyone is following some guide or is trying to have their mount by 40 and farming in a specific way.
---
I went for 11 holy first for concecration, then into Ret, so I can tank dungeons early on, but leveling solo is a bit slower
---
I downloaded an addon (I think it was TukUi) that changed the order the loot goes into my bag. It now fills out the last bag first instead of the first bag. I uninstalled all the addons but it still is like that. Is there a command or option that will return it to normal? I want my loot to go into my first bag first, not the last.
---
Ogrimmar Bank in Blah-mew; spent a minute trying to right click the teller.  Disconnected within seconds of my inventory appearing.
---
So less than a minute probably.
---
That legitimately pisses me off. Whiny losers. That was one of the best farming spots for warlocks tbh
---
Oh, they care about names now?
---
Back in Vanilla a guildmate of mine had a bank twink called "Azuregos". Sometimes yelled in Ironforge the exact phrase that Azuregos yells in Azshara.
---
People were alway going crazy in the chat, asking how it's even possible to kite the dragon from Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms ;-)
---
tanking isn't very fun, it's very stressful and it takes a lot more gold than normal people. Plate is significantly more expensive to repair and needs repairing more often because tanks take more hits than other people.
---
It's a thankless job so people are now basically demanding that you thank the tank (monetarily) for their efforts, otherwise they are just hemorrhaging gold from groups who don't take things seriously and don't care if they wipe. Those same people who then also feel entitled to loot when they didn't really contribute anything.
---
Same can be said for people with UBRS keys. If you're not willing to gather the gems and get your key, why is that someone else's responsibility that they cannot benefit from doing?
---
It's funny how you talk about entitlement with seemingly no perspective on what kind of effort goes into these "entitled" peoples work.
---
No worries and good luck!
---
Fishing pole and a sly wink, so far so good....
---
Spirit also affects mage armor mana regen.
---
Haha literally did the same except I'm using my ironing board as a standing desk 'cos the TV is wall mounting and is messing my back up üòÇ
---
You will "see the light" around lvl 22 or so, when you die of old age...
---
Hitting need does not automatically detect whether you're rolling for mainspec or offspec. If person A hits need for mainspec, and person B hits need for offspec, person B may still win the item.
---
This is not faction specific. Sometimes I brutally camp horde...sometimes I help them quest. 
---
We're all just people man.
---
that was quick lol. thanks for the help! :)
---
15 dollars are 15 dollars. Its just that each dollar is more expensive. I live in uruguay where a dollar is worth 37 U$. As i said in my example argentina has regional pricing, they pay with their own coin and they end up paying 3-4 dollars per month.
---
As for how much around U$600 is... around 15 beers i guess. Not really that much but on top of other subscriptions i feel it.   
---
I'll come back to the game later for sure. Im trying to save for some things and i want to buy death stranding soon too.
---
The only thing that bothers me is that im never paying the same. Depending on how the dollar is doing each month the game becomes cheaper or more expensive.
---
True. Good clarification on the 1 or 2 levels since that is easily achievable in a single group running multiple instances.
---
They work fine for me. You use them to tank one mob while you fear a second and drain tank a third.
---
Looks like luna to me. You can customize it a fair bit.
---
If that was indeed the case, then I m sure everybody can agree that is a dick move bud.
---
he sounds much too far gone for that to have any effect
---
OP yes, Not the comment i replied too.
---
Anything with a decent amount of spell power.
---
As a healer, it's comforting to see a holy priest in the party as dps. Just in case I fail to notice someone's hp, they can do a mini heal to hold them over.
---
&gt;So any time you need a warlock summon, mage port, a chest opened in a dungeon, etc, you should have to pay for it right? 
---
People have charged for summons, porting, and lockpicking since the game was released, so you're doing a pretty terrible job trying to make a counterpoint here.
---
What is the best spec for PvP in the world? Afflication, Soul Link or Destruction nuke?
---
Not all classes are equal. Some classes need to buy way more spells than others.
---

Did you play in vanilla-wrath? Did you experience the aging community die off due to Life changes? and see your realm become a 90/10 ratio?
---
If not you have no weight in saying " try it "
---
They dont want to open that many servers and see them fall off and merge them again.
---
Then to have to balance battle groups. ( if you didnt play during this time - they bridged 5-10 servers for BGs to avoid long ques.
---
Basically the " mega servers " everyone is crying about are the battlegroups tied into 1 server with the same ah.
---
Economies arent going to be affected by high demand / high supply because removing layers will cause supplies to plummet - forcing a high demand boosting ah economy. 
---
The A.H. economy will be wrecked by the retail kids undercutting high value items with 500 linen cloth 1 at a time to spam market at a 50% mark down and no one will scroll the pages to find stacks at real value because the undercuts that today's retail sees. Due to cross faction AH. High supply all the time in retail due to layers -- ah is trash.
---
I was so stoked to hit 40 at 3am, only to realize you don‚Äôt just get the free mount as a lock, there‚Äôs a quest involved. 
---
Luckily that didn‚Äôt take long :D
---
Poor thing. Here might I offer you this Hillsbrad Pumpkin?
---
Has anyone checked to see if it works now that classic is out?
---
Yeah.  You really just need to know rough times and the GM can do it all.  I have had a GM tell me before that they dont use any user sent content (ss or videos) to resolve these types of issues.
---
It's funny that in this game priests and warlocks are absolute gods to any warriors but the most geared. I fought a 42 priest 1v1 a couple times last night, he just stood there in shadow form slowly killing me I was like "WHY CAN'T I EVEN HURT YOU?"
---
It 100% works in classic.
---
But you got a ton of XP! and that's the point.
---
I'm starting to get so many skills and I'm not sure what I should use as an affliction drain tank. Do I cast all three dots: curse with DoT, immolate, and corruption and then follow with life drain?
---
Im considering removing immolate from my rotation bc of the cast time. Also, is it okay to remove searing pain (the skill that's destruction with 1.5 cast time) from my hot bar? It generates threat and seems like little damage.
---
No. Mobs turn grey when they are 7 level below you. It's always been like that.
---
Definitely do all the quests you can in Tanaris, Badlands, and STV. 
---
Lots of people on my realm do Uldaman runs and there are lots of quests to do. After all that, you should be able to start doing some ZF runs.
---
Ehh no.. but why i dont even
---
I‚Äôm confused then. You replied to me about that exact thing. Retail has a system to protect you from being ninja‚Äôd and op wants a system to protect you from being ninja‚Äôd.
---
7-12 for me because my hands are too small to reach the 1-6 buttons. God I wish they‚Äôd bring out a multi-button mouse for my teeny hands.
---
Considering we're talking about dungeons, it's absolutely what I do. Like I said, I only ask them to heal me if I take a large amount of threat and get hit by multiple mobs. And also considering most groups don't even take anything except warlocks or mages unless they're friends, I don't run into many rogues. 
---
I chalk up me being top dps in 9/10 of my dungeons due to the fact that I invested a small portion or the money I saved from not having to buy a mount to be in almost full shadow damage gear. I had all of the shadoweave gear crafted, and purchased almost all other slots with +shadow damage. At my current level the only items that can provide an upgrade is either the crit sword from Mara or the spell power staff from ZF which is only a total of 1 spell power upgrade. 
---
Most other players I inspect don't take the time to optimize their gear while leveling with the exception of dungeon gear.
---
I get out dpsed on aoe pulls by ravager warriors and mages that go all out aoe. But when I run with 2 mages, and I can save fly hellfire non stop, they don't beat me. Single target I've only been beat by people who were higher level than me and had a better hit rate against higher level bosses.
---
Respect mate, thanks for the comment!
---
Yeah... he waited... sure. Or he couldn't get there while he was still in combat.
---
So I have force of will, mark of honor and rune of the guard captain. I was using force of will and rune since I thought the +hit was better but should I switch back to mark?
---
Ah yes, thirty-one o'clock.
---
slutmog is best mog
---
It isn't a pserver thing.  People did this in vanilla too.  Although in vanilla is it was really only on raids or extremely rare items.
---
Just witnessed a dude trying to sell Hurricane,  an admittedly great level 48 epic bow, for 75g.
---
Sure, yes, it's BiS for that PvP bracket, but BGs are several months away and nobody has that kind of cash lying around (that they want to spend). *Noone*.
---
This was to be expected though.   
---
People are either coming from retail, private servers, or with the lest memory of WoW being long after Vanilla was new. They're used to insane stashes of gold, and are fumbling strong in complete darkness when it comes to the worth of items.
---
It's take months before the economy makes any kind of "sense".
---
So no one at all is supporting those players, they are just saying let them spec fire.
---
The focus is on the Playerframe where the Dragon is and the ticking mana Regen bar beside it :)
---
Although I do have a macro to feast + drink at the same time
---
Lol that‚Äôs awesome
---
Yeah, I shudder to think what I've spent in deposits. People are not buying leveling gear right now, which makes sense, it's most people's first character and they're taking their time leveling, doing dungeons for gear, and saving up for mounts. Once people start really rolling with Alts I think lower level gear will sell better. 
---
Somewhat related, The bag market is upside down right now on Sulfuras Horde side. Wool bags are posted at 8s and cost 21s to make.

---
Wish I could take credit for it, but I was paraphrasing a joke Bill Burr did in one of his specials.
---
During the original WoW release I would tell groups that I wanted specific items but would pass on every other drop. No one ever said they had a problem with that.
---
For leveling, I'd spec into combat. If you wanna be the most efficient, check out a rogue leveling guide on wowhead or icy veins. A lot of good general knowledge in them for how to choose weapons, etc..... Or just play your way and learn as you go. No wrong way.
---
This tip is usually accompanied by unbinding Q and E. AKA, movement is only done with WASD and the mouse, freeing up Q and E for binds closer to your main hand position. Whether you want AD to be strafe or turn is up to preference. I did this a few years ago and it makes a world of difference not having to sprawl out for that 0 Arcane Explosion while trying to move :) More here: https://www.wowhead.com/guide=875/the-art-of-effective-keybinding
---
Found the Horde player.
---
He needs to have his own place and he needs to work. Sounds like he might need professional help. However, The way you made it sound is that he leverages his illnesses in order to dupe your parents in to letting him do whatever he wants. Do you think he could operate independently? If the answer is yes,  then you need to level with him, especially your parents.
---
Maybe it's a Quebec thing only?
---
That's not right.
---
A guy went right past me fighting a creature between me and a quest item, picked the item, said sry and went on. I didn‚Äôt complain but it was really annoying me. Ten minutes later, the same guy invites me to group, I guess he finished picking quest items and discovered he needed help with the kill x quest that was next. Naturally I declined. Half a minute later he whispers me rez pls, I answer no, you stole my quest item. He laughs and continues to beg me for rez and I give in. I‚Äôm new to wow and I guess my soft heart got the better of me. After rezzing I healed him but left his group, I didn‚Äôt want to befriend this person further. But this really nagged me, why did I give in? I got another invitation from him an hour or two later, still declined, but I should never have rezzed him.
---
delete your alliance characters and play horde
---
Nah fam succubus literally dies in 2 seconds so idk where you get this from
---
Yes? If they actually decided to do that
---
Decide what you want out of the game.  If you just want to get to the end of the road as fast as you can, go get a quest guide or addon.  Otherwise, go see the world.
---
Ferals, Tanaris, Dustwallow Marsh, Badlands, swamp of sorrows, STV.
---
Shhh, let me believe!
---
They aren't talking about that gear, they're talking about switching straight up damage equips for spirit. I have many +spell damage pieces with hardly any stats, and I can swap to a staff that has no damage but huge spirit. You will end up having a lot of +dmg gear and not as many stats if you're getting the right mage gear. Like ______ of frozen wrath stuff.
---
Yup. As someone leading MC pugs, its in the description. The only item on reserver is the bindings. Rest is free roll for your roll. 2nd priority is offset
---
Once you triple wind fury crit a gnome‚Äôs dome for the first time, you‚Äôre always gonna be chasing that dragon.
---
#AAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Thanks very much! On the note of Paladins then, do you know if their healing stays relevant throughout the phases? I know for example I read the MC raid gear wasn‚Äôt actually a good set for Paladin and that pre-raid BiS is better to heal in... Is this an issue throughout vanilla that causes priests/Druids to eventually pull far ahead and make pally obsolete or do later raid sets get it right do you know?
---
I do less damage when I use rend.
---
You can run the instance on your own to make vendor gold, or you can place one other person at the beginning of an instance and then sell items (a BIS ring for many classes off the last boss) to them via master loot.
---
The ring goes for about 20g.
---
no. its pretty great for everyone besides warrior and rogue. im pretty shocked so little people actually know how to gear for pvp.
---
I just don't want to waste my time. I'm not trying to rush to max.
---
See what the disenchant value is.
---
And I wouldn't. I'd get mildly annoyed.
---
50 seconds in if you're curious.
---
I see that peeking behind the mug.
---
What's that hit sound at 0:55, I recognize it but can't place it
---
Feel entitled to loot when they didn't contribute anything? 
---
Are you serious? You're gonna say that DPS contribute nothing and don't deserve loot because you had to work so hard to level your tank and your repairs cost more than theirs?
---
Everyone is entitled to roll on loot that they need as an upgrade, not just the tank because he has a hero complex.
---
Everyone is willing to gather those ubrs gems, but few get lucky enough with the rolls. Your lucky rolls do not entitle you to free loot in the dungeon when you're already running it. If you think it does, you're an entitled dick.
---
It's funny how people think tanks somehow earn the right to reserve loot because they had so much trouble leveling, spamming dungeons whenever they felt like it for crazy exp lol
---
How are people 23 Manning the raid? Is it just easier for some reason now?
---
I am just here to call you an Ugly Gnome and yell for the horde!!!
---
It must be different depending what faction or server you play on because I have a hunter and a mage friend who do just this and have a functioning group in a couple of minutes.
---
I never liked the barrens because it's so large and you're on foot.  Have you done everything in Silverpine Forest yet?
---
I too would really like to know what addon you're using for this.
---
That's kind of in the game already in the from of need before greed, but that wouldn't let the pally roll on cloth with int.
---
Lol just picked up bl3. Haven't even touched it. I'll tell you one thing though, I'll be ready to take a break from wow in November when death stranding drops. Again again I. April when Cyberpunk drops.
---
I feel for you guys; you horde on Heartseeker probably transferred to try to keep a balanced server ratio. Instead, you went from outnumbering alliance (at least on Stalagg) to being outnumbered by the same people that transferred off and are probably ripe for vengeance. I'm still alliance on Stalagg, and I sort of wish they would just combine the servers again - Heartseeker being our transfer destination should not have the complete opposite ratio of the source servers. Now, we'll just end up with multiple dead servers with factions lopsided in different directions.
---
Generally, any quest that is not grey is worth doing. If none of those available, just go to another zone
---
I just got SFK and I few quests I'm to level for.
---
I use weakaura. You can just program whatever suits you.
---
Got the belt after ~20 runs of arena.
---
But I'm on run 37 in lbrs with no pants, pattern or hands
---
&gt;	jump in a dungeon fresh 15
---
That‚Äôs Retail language right there!
---
With the complete drought of tanks in the game right now I honestly wouldn't be surprised if tanks charged for their services.
---
Older flatscreen 17inch will be about ten bucks in second hand shops and do the job. Ask about and people might give you them free, I have a couple.
---
Have you gone to southern barrens?  It's higher level than northern barrens.
---
This is the one for me. It's my day to just grind gold and yell at the tv
---
Low? Pre-40 greens are nearly 8g on my realm.
---
That's like nearly 7g 20s too high from Vanilla
---
Free hobbies are good but when you can‚Äôt afford 15 for a sub then spend less time playing and more time getting that earning up.
---
Azeroth autopilot is the addon you'll want. It's the most efficient way to quest, but it stops at 40
---
I only made it about 1/3 of the way through your post.  
---
As the healer (or tank) you are responsible to be a leader in a five-man.  Lay ground rules and set boundaries early.  
---
&gt; HoTs only for the warlocks - make sure you have food and healthstones at the ready.
---
You only have to say this once.  The most I'll do is through a PWS on a lock, when i'm priest healing and if I'm feeling extremely generous, I'll throw a rejuv from druid.  That's it.
---
It only takes 1-2 deaths before they get the message.
---
You caught me lol
---
unsure atm
---
Which is exactly what I mean. Nobody expects to get bindings in a pug mc, but reserving shit in a 5 man is just ridiculous.
---
Westfall Ally is the same dude, level 10 greens are nearly a gold.
---
Those people will unsub soon and grind some other game, the just jump from grind to grind
---
wanted to know why it happened, figured this was best way to get intel
---
I think it's a stretch to say that you were ever a DPS
---
Once your whole party is in combat you'll probably have a better time of keeping threat spamming Battle Shout.
---
Thorns effects and shield spikes help keep them on you longer, and eventually you can stack enough to be better than a Paladin tank at AoE.
---
But a lot of those effects are not available to you yet. You're almost high enough to hit up Un'Goro and get some Crystal Spires though. That'd help.
---
Actually managed to find it myself and forgot all about this comment chain again but thank you alot none the less!
---
Yeah shitty players want the thrill of a win so they fight only in circumstances they know they can win in. It's dishonerable. I love to /s dishonerable whenever my own faction pulls this shit, they usually get tilted about being called out on it, but they are scum and they're a disgrace to us all, I live and die on azeroth as an honorable being.
---
That is very frustrating, hope your group remade in time
---
What. Far Sight is super useful in checking if Camp Nesingwary is safe to go to or not
---
I only use agony and corruption most of the time. If I'm pulling multiple enemies I add in siphon life. I very rarely use immolate
---
Typical horde xD
---
Those fish will come back to bite!
---
Yeah APES first and second week MC clears will be significantly faster than most average guilds are clearing MC in month 3.  If you think every guild is going to have sub 1hr MCs you are dreaming.  Vanilla raiding is not about rotations or anything like that, it is about raid prep and perfecting the same actions over 100s of runs.  Just watching a VOD of APES doing a 40 minute MC is not going to result in your guild doing the same
---
I see, thx for the heads up
---
Go read my reply to the other guy. I meant people in general. The majority don't want to wait, they are selfish. The majority happens to be Horde, so I said Horde.
---
I switched over to holy/disc once I entered Uldaman because in my experience most warriors couldn't take the damage from the mobs in the second half of the instance without me healing nonstop, and I was OOM pretty much all the time. Even running into the same thing in ZF. I figured I'll just spend the rest of my leveling experience in dungeons from here on out, which is kind of a drag but motivated me to start an alt for when I don't want to deal with the RNG of a decent group.
---
To Management,
---
Rockbiter is way more boring thatn WF.
---
Love,
---
Shamans who actually have WF
---
Awesome, just need to make a front page reddit post to get an actual human response from Blizzard.  Thank you Blizzard for fixing everything!
---
Legalize Felweed  
---
Cleavin Stevens
---
This needs waaaay more visibility and understanding. Great points here.
---
Lol digging that external cooling you've got going on there
---
THIS.
---
well, considering you cant go sl/sl until burning crusade, Id say that's pretty moot.
---
I know warlords of draenor was dogshit but not bad enough to go live under a bridge for 6 months over
---
Do you think warlock surpass rogue in high lvl pvp? Where do you think is worse or better in terms of pvp?
---
What does taking the soul do
---
...about negative PR from a front page reddit post.
---
I personally try to avoid these new meta groups and personally accept anyone in dungeons, quests or any other group activity. Im all for trying out new things but to push this stuff to be the norm isnt in the spirit of vanilla.
---
But general fight complexity is not what makes vanilla raids difficult.  For one the raid size is larger, which makes any sort of mechanic inheritely more complicated.  Secondly, threat management is a legitimate concern and is itself a mechanic.  Lastly there are little no raid wide healing spells in classic, as a result the raid as a whole has more personal responsibility for their own life.  This is managed through protection potions, health stones, LIPs etc.  All of these things add up to a situation where the fights are more difficult than they appear on paper, and even though the exact fight recreated in retail would be a cake walk, they do provide some challange
---
&gt; Spell power scales Blizzard more than it scales AE,
---
That is not true as we are talking about damage per mana. Per cast it scales better but not per mana.
---
&gt; And all of this is ignoring the two utilities of Blizzard that AE does not have... 
---
Utilities are irrelevant if you dont need it. But if we are going to talk about utility, lets talk about pushback and interrupts, since blizzard is subject to pushback and interrupts. That is a pretty major drawback
---
&gt; Isn't the difference 30% threat reduction for Blizzard and 40% threat reduction for AE? Making the difference 10%? And 
---
70/60 = 1.166~
---
Imagine if one spell had 90% threat reduction and another 80%. The one with 90% threat reduction would deal half the threat of the one with 80%.
---
&gt; If you take longer in between pulls to drink, you are effectively doing less DPS. It negates the benefit of increased DPS, which is the entire argument for spamming AE.
---
It doesnt negate the difference because drinking is a dps increase. By emptying your mana pool faster and drinking faster you are using your mana pool more effectively. You will use a lot more mana per run which means that you will deal a ton more damage.
---
This is especially true when we factor in the time it takes to pull monsters and build threat. 
---
&gt; As a mage, you're going to always pull aggro when you AoE. AE, Blizz, Flamestrike, whatever. No tank has the AoE threat generation to keep up with consistent AoE damage.
---
That is a bigger reason not to use Blizzard. Blizzard deals more threat, is subject to knockback and interrupts and has less burst.
---
&gt; Tldr: AE is a good skill and there are use cases but I think Blizzard is the more consistent skill that will keep you and your group from wiping while doing overall the same or higher DPS than AE spam.
---
AE mages usually almost doubles the damage of blizzard mages in dungeons. This is not really a debate and something that every proper mage knows.
---
Just invite Paladin or Druid tanks. They actually pay attention to their party members or at the very least know what it's like to heal.
---
t. paladin
---
You prob could have negotiated a piece for yourself
---
You don't even need 5 people. I take rogue + caster + healer + me (tank). Rogue gets HoJ (I've seen 5 drop now), I get chest, caster gets belt and healer gets trinket. Everyone is happy. Glad to hear it only took you 100 runs for the chest.
---
Do you have the classic action bars and bartender both on your ui?
---
Saving one point for a rainy day. I like the versatility you bring to the table.
---
wow well done mate this is some superb content i appreciate you &lt;3
---
Bruh
---
Quick note on the slimes in mara.... you do not tank those.  Aoe kite them around.  They hit real hard at melee so just kite and noone be in melee range.  You can grab that whole room of slimes at once because they won't be hitting anyone.
---
Tank me home tonight
---
True and the only reason I used it for so long, it's definitely fun.
---
Im on the same server x)) i have no issues healing 2H war tanks , unless u have a mage that aoes everything and pulls then rip
---
There's no "benefit" for greeding. I get what you are saying I just dont play for profit and dont really care if someone ninjas something I was gonna just sell anyways. I care more about not ruining the game for someone who might use that item
---
because holy priests actually doing their job don't wanna lose gear to actual dead weight
---
That scream sound effect over the feared Tauren had me lol'ing decently hard...your edits are awesome!
---
Beepbeepimajeep
---
Never fight a ock underwater, they have 20% water speed and breathing, you will lose 100% of the time
---
Ive used both (not TSM tho) and i prefer auctionator over auctioneer. Very good selling UI
---
Can you please share the script for that macro?
---
As someone who leveled a warrior back in the day, I can confirm that death is an old friend. When you get jumped like that, you're not getting ganked - you're going home.
---
Yea being offended is only a recent thing
---
Not like back in the olds days
---
Good logic fucktard
---
they are also signs for positive and negative , not just plus and minus, so it makes sense to me but honestly i have never seen anyone use them like that
---
Not trying to bust your bubble but you taking any credit for this is just laughable 
---
Hes the reason you get bombared with whispers , not you
---
can find another you on the corner bro
---
How did you grind your gold for it?:)
---
Spergs come and spergs go...
---
Me neither and i don't even have wow!
---
I've never encountered anyone doing this but I kind of like it as language-neutral shorthand.
---
what a shitty guild, its not like you need those mats for anything else...
---
yes you need them for some stuff which half of isnt even in the game and the other 49% patterns didnt drop anyway. and the amount you need for that is only 1-2 ids worth of drops.
---
does your guild stack all that shit for "rainy days"? not like they can use it anyway right now.
---
to your gold problem, run strat live with 1-2 crusader orbs reserved. a little roll luck and a fast group you get 1-2orbs (30g each) some blues (5-10g) and some other vendor stuff. takes about 30min.
---
Adding more key words to make things more interesting;

Banana, Toyota tundra, fishsticks, Seinfeld, space station, peewee herman, Godzilla, world war 3, ozone layer, mind control, area 51, lord of the rings, bubbles
---
Thank you! This is exactly along what i wanted :)
---
o tbh i didn't notice there was sound till you said that, i forget to check if theyre muted. i see now, that makes a lot more sense lol.
---
I just got the denial, now they're saying I bought in game items. Any suggestions on how to overturn the denial?
---
Dude it's a game
---
Lol, I guessed 4-5 but Asmon and his clan of lackeys can already lag cities just by him being in game. 
---
Dude has 3 maybe even 4 guilds full of players which cap at 1000 from what I hear. I‚Äôm not familiar with the player size of all the other severs but Faerlina is gonna be a nightmare no matter what happens. Im thinking about transferring to to the RpPvp just to give it a try but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs possible yet.
---
Hmm. Do warriors actually need to rage dump? My issue is usually getting enough rage to use it. Maybe I'm doing something wrong lol
---
\+
---
Ganked for NOREASON
---
If it‚Äôs a rogue you‚Äôll more often than not wanna run VW. If you‚Äôre alliance especially, if you‚Äôre horse you could run succubus. I‚Äôd probably sac VW after a global, immediately out of the stun death coil and fear right after. Amplify curse, agony, siphon, corruption as chasing the feared target. Then you can reapply fear (obviously do this earlier if it‚Äôs broken). Fill with searing pain etc. casters you‚Äôll use fel hunter
---
Whitemane went down too.
---
This guy is EASILY offended. ü§î
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs disgusting
---
Top guilds don't need to bring PUGS to UBRS. They already have MC on farm status with guild only runs.
---
So lemme get this straight...
---
So because *you* think the warden staff is more important than an epic mount (which arguably has more uses long term but that's another story), that makes everyone else who rolls need "greedy"... I get you're trying to seem morally superior but that's a pretty warped view of things. I guess everyone is greedy in this scenario if you wanna look at it that way. In fact, everything you just said is so warped, I'm in shock that you thought it was a good idea to comment lol.
---
Nothing vendors for that amount, so get that out of your head already. Next you'll say "no I'm saying what if it was"... well it's not so just stop embarrassing yourself with that. What if the warden staff was bop, what if epic mounts were free in classic. Just stop. It's just a lame attempt at trying to form an argument lol.
---
Also, another way to ruin your argument is druids have an option in phase 2 to get a weapon that is only a MINOR... I repeat, A MINOR downgrade to the warden staff that ***IS*** farmable. Arguably, that could make any druid demanding their warden staff greedy over the ones that are simply trying to do the smart thing and if anybody is willing to spend hundreds of gold to unnecessarily "minmax" their character, by all means, either do that or hope you get lucky and win the roll next time.
---
ITs not ninja looting, sorry! Can't wait for you to repeat yourself.
---
&gt;Stuns from procs such as Improved Revenge and Improved Concussive Shot do not diminish and are not diminished by Controlled Stun abilities such as Hammer of Justice and Kidney Shot.
---
I distinctly remember Improved Revenge getting DR'd when I first got it, but that was maybe 3 weeks ago so it's entirely possible *that* was the bug and they've since fixed it. It doesn't seem to DR anymore but then I'm also mostly using it in a dungeon setting now and usually avoid putting it on the same target twice in a row.
---
Sounds like a case of "I know I can easily kill th m, so I will "
---
Courage, Merry. Courage for our friends.
---
I like it
---
The Devilsaur gears (hand + legging) as long you have skinning you'll be fine looking for someone that can craft you the gear, the legging pattern for it cost quite a penny and a pain to grind (&lt;1% drop rate). Beside crafting some gears while you level up, you can wait till around level 45 since the tribal quest require a lot of turtle scales that the AH doesn't have the supply for or cost a lot.
---
ClassicThreatMeter works for me and my groups
---
farming how? aoe? 
---
For my farming I personally use 31/10/10 but will probably respec 31/0/20 and just drain tank all day long. Im sure you can come up with a way to use the stunaoe build in destro but I cant imagine a world where thats mana efficient enough to actually kill packs of mobs, as unlike imp blizzard mages, theres no slow.
---
Could try it though I suppose
---
Warrior by day, stripper by night. Somethings gotta pay the mount bills right
---
Hi, /u/LoreChief
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/da7o51/rule_3_should_be_ignored_with_evidence_when_it/). 
---
Yes.  The customer support at Blizzard used to be best I've seen from any company.  Now it's just automated, dismissive responses.  I wouldn't be surprised if they outsourced their custom support to the Philippines like most shitty American companies.
---
And frankly if WoW does close down, he will just find a new fixation.  There's no shortage of addictive games.
---
I'm pretty sure you have to buy the 40 training before 60 anyways, but yes you can save gold on the actual mount (can't remember which is the expensive part). But you should just buy it, it's totally worth it and gold gain ramps up hard after 40
---
im 32 and at 89g.. have sold like a few stacks of cloth/mats on the ah. stay off the ah unless you get a sick boe and vendor everything. also i hope youre not buying skills
---
Literally heal better your job is to keep the group's health high no matter how it got low
---
Completely, what an opportunity to build relationships and perhaps find a tank by being decent people... oh wait let‚Äôs actively look to get one over on people instead!
---
  /facepalm  
---
(WHICH DOESNT EVEN EXIST IN CLASSIC I HAD TO MAKE MY OWN NERDY MACRO /endrant)
---
Your brother sounds like cancer. Stay away.
---
Flametongue is calling, it wants your opinion back.
---
1h + Flametongue wep + wf/searing totem + flurry and you're golden
---
So, I guess this is all just made up?
---
OP, read this advice. Your brother needs help and he's been placated so long it's going to be extremely tough. Your parents really screwed the pooch on this tbh but it's never too late to try if you want.
---
But why are you trying to make that point? 
---
Op is saying let people play any spec they want since a half group can clear with ease and then you replied asking if we should let them literally not contribute.
---
I mean it sucks if you are somehow running into people that dumb but no one is saying that that is ok.
---
WF for dungeons and Rockbiter for questing/grinding, ez
---
I guess the chance to hit with improved gouge and sprint removing control effects + cooldown reduction. Sub spec is only useful if your higher level where combat is practical early.
---
As a leveling warlock, that fear actually landing on a skull enemy was a miracle in itself
---
Oh, I never did that quest, good to hear I'm not missing much haha
---
Fhew‚Äô I thought I was the only one who rested my feet on a plate of chicken nuggets.
---
DEAAATH!!
---
Warlock here. Every dungeon and I really mean EVERY dungeon I've been so far the healer just heals me after life tapping. Even if I'm using a bandage or am eating myself. Right now I'm convinced most healer complaining are not even realising that they try to heal themselves.
---
I'm playing a druid for the first time. I'm lvl 26. I suck at PVP. Any tips or videos to check out for druids vs various other classes?
---
Shoulders. Low level shoulder greens, and head greens, sell like freakin' hotcakes.
---
Interesting how everyone who writes these posts were progression raider almost full clear naxx in Vanilla/tbc
---
I can support any content that involves killing filthy horde
---
Holy shit is that what they mean?!
---
Theirs was probably just some boring mana regen ability, anyway. I'll bet it didn't involve ANY creepy, self-mutilating, borderline blood magic. How dull.
---
We tried to steal pyroblast, too. It KIND of sorta worked.
---
Being consistently bad at your job isn't a mistake it's a choice.  A deliberate choice you make hundreds of times a day to do the bare minimum is not an accident.
---
Like it
---
Super nice setup! Let‚Äôs the chillfest begin!
---
I'm pretty sure Flametongue 1h is a myth and Rockbiter is way better for 1h. It does less damage the faster you hit so it doesn't actually do more damage than Flametongue on 2h. Also Frostbrand comes out ahead of Flametongue in almost every test I've seen. Which IMO says a lot because Frostbrand is definitely behind Rockbiter and WF
---
And Flametongue doesn't stack with WF totem
---
Are you letting him die? I know dying decreases loyalty.
---
Sure you can do that. But I just wanna say this. M guild cleared all of Mc and ony in under 2 hours on Tuesday (not crazy fast I know) and it was super easy. But we also are all using proper consumes, specs and proper raid composition. On the other hand, my pal started a pug Mc at the same time which which much more lenient on that things you are saying. In 4.5 hours they made it to Domo and called it. The next day they spent another 4 hours and could not kill rag. Now I'm not saying this is solely because they had ret paladins and shadow priests in their raid. What I am saying is there is a way to make this game easy, and the biggest factor in doing that is by doing these "meta" things you seem to hate so much.
---
If you continue the quest - hes not even looking for the right weed
---
His master wants Doomweed not Gloom weed - Gordo is fucking blasted
---
I do not understand why anyone (other than pvp twinks, and lvl 60s) buying equippable items from the AH. In 2 levels you're gonna get a quest that'll replace that item and pay you to do it. It just doesn't make sense.

Warlock style in pvp depends on which spec you want to play. In the video you can see probably the most beloved one for every lock that tried classic on private servers recently (he is using the shadow trance confla spec linked in the video description [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0buRbZ0oZxx0tMbtp](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0buRbZ0oZxx0tMbtp)). With strong gear, you can exploit large amount of +crit and play this offensive style with a lot of burst tied to shadowburn and confla.   
---
Standard raiding spec 30/0/21 is kinda similar when it comes to huge numbers, but you will mostly rely on shadow bolt/soul fire setup after heavily dotting your target. You can use this spec to both raid/farm maraudon/do 5-mans and do both world and bg pvp (tho in organized pvp locks use the confla/shadow trance spec cause of the higher burst potential). I would consider using something like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRbkAZZxx0tMbz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRbkAZZxx0tMbz) so you can rely on drain life a bit if needed. Also for purely pvp this variation might bring you more success: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRboZbxZxx0tMLz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRboZbxZxx0tMLz).  
---
The third I would consider going is the drakedog spec (has tons of variation). Bassicly you go deep destro, get bonus stamina and stronger hs from demo, and life tap from affliction. You depend on your succubus, and try to pull nuke chains of seduction (timing your seduction casts exactly after you hit your target with couple of spells). This spec isnt that popular anymore, but you can have so much fun after learning how to destro nuke chain some1. Would add that the most successful destro tbc pvp spec kinda is this spec plus shadowfury. One version of this spec could be: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZbxZxE0tMbtt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZbxZxE0tMbtt)  
---
Lastly you got the strongest pvp spec in all vanilla, The soul link spec (coming in two variations, the rot one and the direct damage one). Both of these specs are simply op, tho they dont have the huge crits and flashy playstyle. Direct damage variation: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZbxhkgxotbVx0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZbxhkgxotbVx0z)  Rot variation: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRbZbxhkgxot](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0fVRbZbxhkgxot)  
---
In pve you use curse that raid leader tells you to use, and use shadow bolt and life tap. Depending on the phase and your raid setup, you could be the lucky lock getting to use your corruption. Dont expect to be hit capped any time soon, and expect to farm those damned shards. Gold shouldnt be a problem, you can pull off really good gold per hour farms in all phases.
---
sick
---
Or a kill one more wolf or I fix my ui man! lol
---
Understandable.
---
There arent enough free points to warrant improved drain life in an sm ruin build. You could give up CoEx for it but I wouldnt consider it worth it. Gear will make up the difference.
---
I did say it has its issues
---
Completely agree. Just do a damage or contribute a totem or something. Don‚Äôt be useless.
---
Crippling poison/mind numbing poison and kick fear. If you're undead will of foresaken their next fear and it should be good.
---
Looks comfy as shit
---
Oh so I‚Äôm not the only one Xd
---
Witch hunting is a site wide rule.
---
Sure but at least we got somewhat lower gas prices for a couple of years
---
This was my first epic so I didn't know that. Up until that point everyone had rolled need on gear they actually needed at that point for their character so I thought that was the custom.
---
For real, you need to get those nugs between the keyboard and mouse.
---
hell yea
---
I was standing on the end of the docks fishing when the boat came up and grabbed me by the helmet. It took me all the way out to see, attached by the horns on my head, until I landed in the middle of the ocean and died &lt;10 seconds from Fray Island.
---
I wish searing pain didn‚Äôt have the high threat. I‚Äôd love to try full fire-lock.
---
................... don't buy the mats, at least not until the market has solidified and there's more buyers for consumables.
---
It is putting everyone at an equal level. They don't deserve a high priced boe more than you and you don't deserve it more than them.  
---
All roll need and everything is equal.
---
On horde they‚Äôd have let you have it.
---
I feel personally attacked as a warrior. Honestly, though, I'm level 39. I tank most dungeons with a two hander and whirlwind spam because that's giving me almost as much TPS and way more dps. I only throw sword and board on for bosses. I refuse to do spellcleave runs.
---
I know what you mean, but I don't think it's that. I can look through a full 40 man raid aoeing and i have no fps drops. It's just in redridge for some reason.
---
Turtle has the lowest dps of any pet in the game, it shouldnt be holding aggro better than wind serpent. Straight up single target aggro your best bet is a cat since it does the most damage, and has better tank stats than raptor.
---
For aoe tanking some people like owl, but i find screech to be overrated. The aoe rarely can handle even one mend pets worth of threat. I prefer gorilla. If you time the thunderclap well you can hit 3 mobs with it and its enough to hold aggro through a few mend pet casts.
---
Turtle though is the best pet for soloing super hard elite quests. It has the lowest threat but the shield spell can make a huge difference if an elite 3 levels over you pops berserking or just hits super hard.
---
Hillsbrad Border Patrol
---
When it comes to BOE, everyone NEEDS that gold ;)
---
I am sticky on this. Will listen
---
What do you mean?
---
That's why you do it on a secondary account, so you can work on your main character while waiting on suspension. A month later you have a lvl 60 that use to farm gold, powerlevel your alts, open portals for yourself etc etc.
---
If you can afford extra sub fee, it's totally worth it
---
The biggest deadweights aren't the bad players. It's the good players with shitty attitudes. Like...yours, for example.
---
Oh it is üòÅ
---
Thanks!  You're the best!
---
I had a similar setup for vanilla. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as nice as yours. That mousepad/keyboard stand thingy is neat. 
---
What‚Äôs your solution to when the leg rest is extended and your mouse slowly slides away every time you let go of it?
---
I find that weird when subs light r/cringetopia and r/yiffinhell exist
---
While I like being technically correct, it's more because OP suggested bears were considered "trash" because they weren't fixed until 1.12, when in reality people just considered them to be bad all along, high armor modifier or not.
---
Oh then I guess I should submit my application to the Department of Mentally Disabled Individuals. :(
---
Not at 40,i don't think runecloth is open to turn in until 45 or 50. Quests won't be enough.
---
This statement is ABSOLUTELY true!!
---
Wait... I've been playing the game till level 36 with everyone only rolling on things their room can use.. since when has there been a 'rule' that anyone can need BOEs to even sell?.. genuinely curious
---
pure gold. kappa
---
That is a terrible idea coming from someone who has obviously never seen a false accusation destroy a player or guilds reputation.
---
Good for you man.  No /s.  With a name like KarmicCannon I suppose you can leave it up to the powers that be to exact justice.
---
Screw that. No derogatory gay jokes! You're not funny...you're being a bastich!
---
If your guild main tank cant MT ubrs it means your guild doesnt have a main tank.
---
I‚Äôd be pretty interested in this way of handling it. I‚Äôd appreciate some kind of classic+  at some point.
---
This reminds me of an experience I had in retail warmode. I was rolling a disc priest in Mudsproket when two horde, I forget what one of them was but the other was a hunter were obviously shadowing me. Of course I was like ‚Äúoh ffs they‚Äôre going to jump me as soon as I leave here.‚Äù
---
Of course soon enough I went out to get some quests done and they jumped me. I slapped on my power word shield and they couldn‚Äôt bring me down before I killed them. The best thing about it is when I killed one and switched to the other the one that had died rezzed and started attacking me again. I must of killed them both at least two or three times before they gave up.
---
This is what I did. I didn't have the stuff for 225+, but at level 40 that's fine (assuming mining is your other profession, that is).
---
Pretty clean looking!  I remember those name plates but can‚Äôt remember the mod - help a brutha put?
---
It's more the way they're set up. Not top-aligned and some are overlapping, some aren't even touching the ones next to it. Just a nightmare to look at.
---
What are you using for Unitframes?
---
UBRS is barely even a raid too.
---
Good job putting those scumbags down. Their drowned corpse is a nice touch lol
---
Yeah, Alliance get that quest, too, just from a different NPC.
---
If you killed it without help and nobody else was inside, you did not ninja it.
---
Decurse is at level 30, I believe. Maybe 28. Very nice, I picked it up just before my first Graveyard run, where it came in handy.
---
Not being an asshole here, but I am genuinely curious as to why people play humans in a fantasy game with lots of other interesting species?
---
I was offered 10g per run through of SM by a single level 40 druid. I was a 60 mage. Could have been super quick runs but after how much I ran it while leveling I can't look at that dungeon, probably not for a while.
---
sure if you say so. like i said, go ahead and make your own raid guild that discourages people who properly spec and have BiS, enchants, professions, buffs, consumables, etc.
---
Eh, hiring a mercenary is perfectly acceptable.
---
Okay, so in a guild you get alt runs...people who reserve specific loot or just want to have fun come on their mains, alts get most the loot. The guild is a community so everyone wins. A solid community can't actually exist beyond a hard limit (somewhere between 100 and 200 for humans). So after you leave the tribe (or century/platoon) level you need incentives or someone is losing. Gold is an incentive...loot is an incentive. Some get gold...others get loot (or a chance at loot).
---
Loot is determined on spawn.  Iirc.
---
Not when it dies.
---
What people often don't realize is that if you have 90% damage reduction and you add 1% more, you're actually taking 10% less damage than you were taking at 90%. This is why there needs to be diminishing returns on armor, it can't be linear.
---
Your warrior doesn‚Äôt yell at you but it sure shouts a lot.
---
Speed fucken mods.  Without naming and shaming nothing will get done. Awareness needs to be brought especially since realm transfers are a thing. Sit back and twiddle your thumbs.
---
Flag ES Point Right Door
---
okay and I never said I was...? I said we have the premade foundations of a group so it's easy for us. Also, there are virtually no priests past level 50 on my server that want to heal. They all want to stay in shadowform and do dps. lol
---
Unfortunately it has no leg rest it is extremely comfy though so not really complaining if my legs get tiered I‚Äôll go find something to makeshift a foot stand I suppose
---
doubleplusungood
---
Try to get a Jed ID before you look, bunch of healers that won't touch UBRS unless you have one.
---
&gt;He has been professionally diagnosed with bi-polar and some form of scheizophrenia (spelling), but he adamantly refuses to take any meds
---
Well...shit. That's your problem. Gaming is completely irrelevant to this particular issue, sadly. Gaming addiction, however pernicious, is a much smaller bear to tackle than a bipolar/schizoaffective individual who is refusing any kind of medication or therapeutic assistance. Milder cases of bipolar, or bipolar 2, can be treated with CBT and talk therapy, but it doesn't sound like your brother is even willing to go that far. And you cannot meaningfully help a mentally ill individual who is refusing to acknowledge the problem or begin working on it.
---
It's possible at some juncture he'll have an epiphany and start trying to get his life in order. You can be there for him and assist him in that process if the time comes. But be prepared for it to be a long, difficult road. And the thing about mental illnesses like bipolar...they're chronic. They can come and go like the tides, but they'll always be there. There will always be a struggle.
---
Seriously, what is this dude's problem? lol
---
You're looking at stuff like Witchblade + Aquamentas for 34 spellpower and 8 INT. Or Blade of the New Moon for 19 shadow, 20 spellpower, 5 stam. They're not bad choices. But 30 stamina is a hell of a lot at this point, and warlocks really, really need a decent HP pool in PvP. I would certainly pick Headmaster's over either of those options.
---
&gt; They are 4-6g on some servers already, and thats where i think they should be and stay at. 10g is dumby thicc still
---
Economies are all relative.  You can't assign an absolute price to something when the supply and demand of it are BOTH impacted by variance in population and play type.
---
Ok, I'm a horde player looking for a new home since Skeram is way too lopsided. I've been considering Earthfury
---
Looking at cringetopia right now, everyones name is blacked out. There is no call to action being made against those people.
---
Yeah, Aqua is an idiot (also has a dumb name made even dumber with an umlaut)
---
I've completely leveled Disc. and had zero complaints.  The survivability is unmatched, the damage is decent, and the healing is amazing.
---
Fuck I need this
---
What addon are you using to class color your name plates?
---
Your parents are enablers. Throw his ass out he wants to act like a loon to get his free games let him go spend some time with the real crazies.
---
Why did you add quotes to something they didn't say?
---
"Play what you personally find fun"
---
On my server, almost all Strathholme tanks put orbs on reserve, so groups basically pay them 30-50g a run.
---
Nobody's talking about the ORA at the beginning
---
I mean, personally I think you need to be a special kind of stupid to read that and deduce that it was "a defense of WoW", but it takes all kinds, I guess.
---
You da man. Loving your drain tank guide. Thank you!
---
Skeram is like a sinking ship and Heartseeker is the life boat.   All the women and children took the lifeboats first.  Now the men are whats left.
---
Thank you everyone for your responses. The community within this game is fucking awesome, and I hope the best for all of you. I had a fun time playing, but the game holds more personal impact to me than perhaps others. 
---
Good luck and farewell.
---
&gt;If you can afford an extra sub fee, there‚Äôs just no downside to doing it
---
Except for the downside that those power levels cost hundreds of real dollars. Cheapest I saw was in the high $300 range. I doubt there‚Äôs a significant amount of people paying for those services. 
---
Even if there are, it takes those powerlevelers 1-2 weeks to do 1-60. Add onto that the one month ban they got. That guy isn‚Äôt even playing on that account for a month and a half to two months, in which case had they wanted to they could have leveled it themselves twice or three times over.
---
Realistically, the average player isn‚Äôt going to be affected by this. Sure, while a rollback would be nice, I think a 1 month ban is sufficient.
---
I did it as an experiment to see if stuff actually sells. Gonna put them up tomorrow, sunday and wednesday too to see if it sells at all during the most popular raiding days.
---
If not, im just gonna give them to the guild.
---
I think is is a good idea only because I think it would be hilarious. 
---
My friend told me a story today about one of our guildies getting ninja looted by a rogue for his BIS mail chest piece.  I also pissed myself laughing.
---
Feels bad
---
oh wow how surprising you're the type of person to instantly downvote someone who doesn't even disagree with you. what a shocker
---
What do you guys think is better to focus while leveling a mage, getting gear with increased stats (intellect, spirit, etc) or spell power? For example, focusing on the dagger + off hand (Hypnotic Blade and Orb of the Forgotten Seer) from Scarlet Monastery or the staff (Illusionary Rod)?
---
Sounds like he did tell you?
---
Buy twink blues cheap and HODL.
---
52 lock here, and damn did he suck at lock lmao.  I ALWAYS have food and water on me, even when doing mundane quests. I soultap ya, but trust me it‚Äôs not so bad to heal us when we wait for tank to grab aggro then use rain of fire if we MUST aoe because A) more damge and B) no damage done to me, allowing me to soultap a bit more. Gosh, I am so sorry you had that group experience.
---
High highs and extremely low lows. WF's average overall DPS is still slightly under Rockbiter around 3.8 speed but can be well below half or way above double. Except Rockbiter doesn't have the 1500 damage wasted overkills happening on every 2-3 mobs.
---
Playing a warrior is not the same as playing a tank. There are plenty of warriors that refuse to tank. Tanks and sometimes healers aren't the bottleneck. The only time is is hard to find DPS is when you are running a small number of bosses in the dungeon and are only running the bosses you can get good loot from and nothing else. But that's just because you are skipping all the bosses DPS wants to kill.
---
Posted the actual usage after I made my comment. I agree with you on this one.
---
My server doesn't have that drought.
---
Tons of warriors, and DPS warriors really struggle to get groups as dps because tanks will never invite them.
---
Yeah and everyone above a certain level votes on every single change and they only get implemented if more than 70% vote yes so (mostly) everyone is happy
---
I did.
---
What's funny is it apparently takes a perfect blend of perfect talents + perfect classes and perfect play for you and your friends to pull off simple kills on a 15-year old raid and somehow you think that makes me and my friends the joke.
---
Anyway, cleanup on aisle this guy. I think I'm done here.
---
I say "drinking after this pull" not as a request for pause, but as a warning.
---
I'm drinking after this pull.  I'm going to be sitting and I won't be healing until my mana is full.  
---
If there is a druid or a shaman in the group - toss out a heal.
---
Tank - pop a cooldown or a pot if you need to.  
---
I've had great fun moving at a pretty quick pace through the dungeons in Classic, but when you need to drink, drink.  If they die on the pull they make while you're drinking, that's tough shit for them.
---
Unspoken rules are not rules run shit right and it won't be a problem.
---
preach
---
Really like the idea of fixing the 40-50 and the 50-60 run. If they did do this stuff, i'd say that's how they should do it
---
Other than to say simply try it?  Equip a wand that does shadow damage.  Check its damage on your sheet.  Equip armor that does + spell or + shadow and check again. The damage will be increased.
---
The fact you have KFC gravy won me over.  If only you have a shelf system to one of your arms reach without the need to get up form said position, would win hands down sir!
---
Hi, 
---
so I am like brand new to wow i joined due to classic looking sooooo good and it is but i find that it is quite hard. So if i could aquire some friends to play with. I am willing to goto different servers but i am currently on windseeker as a level 8 almost 9 druid hmu i honestly dont know how to add people ;-; do you do it through battlenet? lol thanks
---
I have 99 gold at level 34.  I am beyond ready to get my mount. Lol 
---
Grats!
---
Grats! Also set up your action bar keybindings! You will become a much better player over time.
---
its not 6-8, i saw it up to 12
---
Flame tongue maybe?
---
Can‚Äôt unsee the fan on top of the PC
---
Your chat made me want to play again...
---
A second monitor can be cheap as fuck, I used a second hand monitor that costed me 25 euros for a long time.
---
I only used it for chat, wowhead and watching videos. You don't need something really fancy for that.
---
Lol it‚Äôs not really that far
---
Great read!
---
Ok so you're an idiot too. Let me explain this slowly. The reason why having a mathematician work the calculations for simming the specs is that it directly correlates to what they have a heavy background in. It's not like taking a rocket scientist and making them an underwater welder. It's literally what they do for a living so they are familiar with it. But regardless you are dumb because you wanted to come in here and try to make this relatable to you. Stick to networking.
---
I stopped using seal of command, i was never getting any procs, just slowly batting away at the mobs hp with white damage. Switched to improved SoR and consecrate, mana can be an issue but im chipping damage faster at least.
---
That's why there's 10 min flight paths, there's the afk sex you need.
---
I can confirm the "4 times this week" while taking vanilla/classic flight paths.
---
At least you didn‚Äôt get shot in said knee while on your adventures
---
They didn't come back. Honestly they probably logged off immediately after and called it a day. Maybe even unsubbed.
---
I have short arms, so I was thinking in my sense of area haha
---
these are not people i want to party with they should stick to retail
---
they are a waste of space and air
---
Yep that‚Äôs the leave all your gear in the bank quest. Underwater breathing swimming up the river next to Durotar. Then climb the ridge between zones. Jump down into the demon area and start visiting graveyards from there...
---
Lolwat?
---
Elvui
---
Hit ‚Äúo‚Äù it‚Äôs the social tab where you can add in-game fiends or battle.net
---
Generally speaking you will find friends while leveling or once you get to a city find a guild to join.
---
Yeah, most of my interactions were great.  The example I offered was last month :D but they're usually pretty damn good even now.
---
The worst incident I actually had was when I or the server lagged... And i went back about 1 minute.  A rubber band isn't so bad... Except I picked up a many gold sale from the mailbox right before going on a flight.  The GM told me that pos hacking was illegal and threatened to ban me... I was shocked to say the least.  He made me feel like I should be grateful I'm being let off with a verbal warning and that they lack powers to recover my gold.  In hindsight, I should have argued back because I'm sure they have the power..
---
In terms of long term mob farming at your level? Drain tank with succubus. Best damage per mana efficiency
---
This isn't SUF or anything, it's how classic is. You can't see enemies' or other players' actual health value, only percent. 
---
I spent a long time in SUF settings trying to figure it out, then did some googling and found that's just how it is in classic.
---
Yeah thanks man, I'll take this experience and learn from it :)
---
Nah even in retail if you want like a piece of armor made you‚Äôll have to fork over some mats. But blizzard is pretty good at helping people so as long as you have it in the chat in game (For evidence) that they agreed to make it, and you were trading the mats, and stuff like that, you can report them if they just up and steal the materials. Don‚Äôt message each other through a discord, or through texts or what have you.
---
The original post you're replying to was entirely about the raids not being *difficult.*  It was the entire context of the conversation.  And you're response was "Saying Naxx is comparable to LFR is 100% false."  What was the point of your defensive post if you two were talking about entirely different things?
---
As far as who said raids in classic were time consuming:
---
"however Naxx requires a significant amount of pre raid prep. The amount of consumes required weekly is significant."
---
soi far every time ive done a dungeon ive been to high to really benefit from it. i wait too long cause im nervous of not being good enough at my current level. but ill try and get a group for gnomer
---
Its true its only wow,but the game looks and feels so smooth:) ull see one day. You will never look back
---
Wep speed is already normalized, arcanite reaper won't be in very high demand at all.
---
Im consistently top dps with Spellhunter.
---
Tryhards on reddit are mostly full of shit in my experience.
---
Scarlet Monestary would be the ideal place to go. However, if you‚Äôre on a PvP serv it‚Äôs horde zone and it might cause you problems if the balance is in horde favor.
---
Yes, yes and yes. Probably only going to get worse too.
---
Love the editing omg
---
All scarlet monastery instances
---
Raid repairs ain't cheap.  Gotta work that pole for fat lootz.
---
Just. Have. A. Look. At. That!
---
And I'm tired of these posts. Play how you want and accept the consequences of that choice - that's how it was in 2005 and that's how it should be in 2019, don't give the raid leaders shit for your choice.
---
Funny to see how almost half of the total XP is in the level range 50-60.
---
 The last 10 levels sure are the toughest.
---
If only that Rogue or Shaman had some way to interrupt your spells. If only.
---
The first two points of that article are stupid as hell. If you have a console and it has no input delay, its fine for PC too. The only TVs i‚Äôve had in a decade that had visual delay was a 720p Hitachi Plasma and a Viera plasma.
---
The last point is quite up to personal preference, so all in all that article is a joke - or possibly just 10 or so years out of date.
---
They don't deserve a Bop more than you and you don't deserve it more than them.
---
That is less of "I don't want people to get fucked over" and more of, "I don't want you to fuck me over."
---
Need if you can equip it or are too low level to equip but will when you can.
---
Greed if your goal is to sell it.
---
Simple logic and price goes away.
---
Yeah I'm saying if you're not in the group, and just being paid to open the door for a group, that's fine. It's when they're forming a group and you say "hey ill come I've got the key, so you need to pay me though" that I have an issue. If you don't need loot and are literally giving a service, cool you deserve to be paid, but if you're needing the run too and want the run plus to be paid for your key, that's garbage.
---
Soul Link is the most busted spec in all of classic wow, its even banned on most vanilla private servers.
---
I recognize so many of the audio clips in this lol
---
Yeah, and basically they're saying "we don't want priests, but we'll accept them if they pass on this item". Which is completely fine imo, and much better than just saying "LF heals no priests"
---
God I love the 30m cds.
---
Two of the best "oh, shit" buttons in the game, and then the "bye have a good time" button.
---
Price level is related to total gold quantity
---
Economics 101
---
That math checks out.
---
I have a hunter with hoj
---
I've heard people talk about the succubus like that. I've never really used her, what exactly constitutes as using her well/poorly?
---
If I did use her, I would turn off her auto-seduce, map it to a key bind, put her on passive, and map petattack to a key bind. Would this be using her poorly?
---
Looking clean. The map in the middle is a bit too fancy for me tho.
---
do you have any suggestions?
---
It is a rule for a reason.
---
It's a 15 year old game that has had years of pservers. All of the stuff you mentioned has pretty much been figured out. You either play a class/spec because you enjoy it or because it's good.
---
30g each? On my realm they go for 15g each
---
Imagine crying about how someone else plays a video game.
---
Yes, this exactly.
---
Get what together? It's common courtesy, just like you shouldn't whisper every single warrior online when you need a tank, warriors shouldn't whisper every single group looking for a tank asking for their dps gear. Make it known what you want, and the ones who are okay with that will come to you.
---
eye pull, use vw if youre doing an iceblock strat, max fire spell damage gear and demon sac imp for +15% fire dmg and hellfire if you can, otherwise rain of fire
---
The amazing thing about this is the fact that you can play with the LFG chat constantly spamming above your normal chat. You can recess chat windows inside one another, would highly recommend.
---
I think reserving loot in general is just annoying as hell anyways... I get in an all raid group giving loot to whoever is always there, but if yur pugging it should be news or greed
---
Is there a resource or a website people are using to get in touch with people they used to play with in vanilla?
---
I'd get to 60 and start hoarding gold with the goal of buying the epic.
---
If P2 comes out before you get enough $$, you should have a good chunk of change to spend on the mats needed for the quest for the Warlock epic.
---
The advantage of buying a standard mount is that it is not a spell, so you can still mount when OOM or silenced.
---
Can anyone tell me what the addon is that displays combat text in the classic style? Tried asking on a few YouTube videos but I didn't get a response. It will literally display everything; from damage taken, spells cast, spells cast against you, entering/leaving combat (extremely important in PvP for me as I am a Hunter), among other things.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTSpZI-244s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTSpZI-244s)  &lt;- At 0:26 the text comes up with the user casting Freezing Trap. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I dont want big heals i just want occasional HoTs so i can manage my health and mana with regen
---
Always nice picking up enchant recipes for a couple silver above their be for price. Much better than a gold a piece...
---
Hand of Justice works for feral druids and is considered a pre raid bis item, at least for dps.

To all the Warlocks that over tap, complain about getting no heals, and refuse to eat, fuck you.   ~The Healer
---
Ew a gnome
---
That's not what I meant by proof. Your sheet may say the dmg increased, but does the actual dmg increase when you hit mobs? To my knowledge, it shouldn't and it sounds like this is a bug with the character sheet.
---
I would love to play an orc on a true RP server.
---
Are you playing at 640x480?
---
For buying, I use auctionator
---
Mark is only good on trash packs really, it doesn't proc often enough to stay up on bosses.
---
it lasts 10 seconds...?
---
Ok, really?  It‚Äôs just gonna be screenshots of people on mounts now?
---
Depends on context. I finally got my Blackstone Ring after offering to tank the entirety of Maraudon for a group of players who wanted to get quests there done as a 53 warrior on the condition that the ring was mine if it dropped. They got a geared tank who knew the instance really well, I got my ring after fourty fucking princess runs, everyone goes home happy.
---
Can't you rightclick nameplates?
---
Ur dps bro. Drain tank is just for when ur questing solo and ur gonna be face tanking mobs ur gonna keep drain lifing and life tapping to sustain your killing uptime.
---
Don‚Äôt wait too long, phase 2 brings a comparable weapon from DM tribute and Warden staffs will be less in demand
---
I am completely new to wow. And I cant stress enough how enjoyable this game is. Taking my time exploring the game and enjoying the quests. I'm pretty sure i am doing so many things wrong but that doesn't matter. I'm so glad I subbed.
---
My bow has suddenly stopped working, as in when I press the hotkey, it does not fire, nor does it give me a "out of range" message.
---
The bow is not broken, I've got arrows and all of the special attacks work (Arcane shot etc) and actually begin the auto-bow after using one.
---
Its just the bow hotkey isnt working for me. Any ideas?
---
This is an amazing lack of self awareness right here. I straight up describe how I bait people, and you bit on the explination. Rock on you psycho fuckstick.
---
Fuck yeah
---
I appreciate your attitude.  Seen a few ‚ÄúAlways remember to /beg and /cry to get out of ganking!‚Äù posts on here that make me ashamed for the poster.
---
make it known what you want....except directly to groups looking for the role you play..  
---
I don't even understand how someone could be so sensitive and irrational. like what
---
Its sick in pvp, horrible for leveling
---
My Naga just died :( had it since 2010. I hate that the buttons left of the left click moved up to the top.
---
yes it does, and with full shadowweave your drains go up by quite a bit, almost ~+30% to the damage and heal
---
1-60 is a lot more than $300.  Not everyone has 150 hours available even in 3-6 months. This shit affects you in no way shape or form bro just shut the fuck up. A month ban is plenty.
---
Thanks!  That last scenario (tabbing to-&gt;away-&gt;back) may explain my confusion and some of the inconsistency my brain is telling me I've seen.
---
You are most likely the actual waste of space and air, especially if you are already 60 ü§£
---
I woulda just healed him cause I'm the shit.
---
What pirates? I haven‚Äôt killed anyone in there, I‚Äôve accepted quests from there but never killed anything, too high level for me
---
Probably someone that doesn't want to make a three hour raid seven hours just because everyone in it is playing specs that have the damage of a level 30 rogue at 60 with BiS.
---
Back then we were 20 good raiders carrying the rest. Unfortunately a warlock wasn't amongst those who did the carrying.
---
This isn't the platform for this.
---
Go to server discord and ask for a channel for hall of shame.  A player on Westfall doesn't care about drama on Herod unless it's really, really good drama...A HoJ ninja does not qualify.
---
Correct.  There is no difference.  There's nothing wrong with reserving items, in any content, provided that you are up front about the items being reserved.  If I need to run MC in a pug one week and a guild takes me along and says I can't roll on Netherwind legs or the Mageblade, I'm probably okay going with them.  If they say all arcanist is reserved, I'll just find another group.  
---
By announcing that you're reserving an item, you are actually being more inclusive than the folks who just protect their cloth armor item by taking only rogues.  If a mage wants to come and have a chance at anything but Item X, then they'll come.  If not, they can find another group.  
---
The problem with reserves really just comes down to when the information is shared.  It needs to be done either in the LFG post itself, or immediately upon inviting someone to the group.  It's a jerk move to wait until everyone is in the instance, it's an even bigger jerk move when it's right before that boss, and it's the biggest asshole move to do it in a raid setting after folks have gotten themselves locked to a raid.
---
That would be using her well.
---
You want to have really good control over Seduce. It's all about having her in the right position to Seduce on demand so you can line up some nasty Shadowbolts.
---
At least you didn‚Äôt take an arrow to the knee while typing that
---
If you gain rep with booty bay you lose it with Bloodsail.
---
Tauren rogues, do it from the side.
---
I am not sure how the lockout works if you haven't killed any bosses. I think I heard that you are locked as soon as you kill something, but I'm not sure. It shouldn't matter too much, though, as long as you aren't trying to join a different in progress group.
---
Yeah I never had that but I did have the 2013 epic version before all these new chromes and I liked the shape and feel better but I dropped it in a cup of coffee and it never worked again ü•∫
---
im just waiting tbh
---
Oil of Immolation. It's cheap and does a decent amount of damage and threat.
---
I‚Äôve never played WoW until I started playing classic and it‚Äôs honestly a beautiful game. I just hit 53 on my priest and I haven‚Äôt had this much fun in an mmo ever. It‚Äôs a lot of fun playing it this way for the first time.
---
If you haven‚Äôt picked a server yet and happens to land on Deviate Delight you can add me! LilSpazi
---
i bet there was a HoJ mafia on private servers that made you believe it didn't work on feral druids
---
You may have /r/trypophobia
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it it won‚Äôt change anything they just hate you cause they‚Äôre scumbag pirates
---
You don't because the game is 15 years old and has been figured out for a while now. The only place that has room for actual experimentation is PvP.
---
I use guidelime  you can get ingame leveling guide and has dungeon guides for the higher lv dungeons
---
Not upfront, but after the run started.
---
That's the same as saying you don't give a fuck about laws just because you pay taxes ...
---
Best way to learn is to duel people. Sadly not much casual dueling to be found right now, maybe people too busy getting gear or lvling to hang out in front of Org/IF dueling :/
---
Warlock has a huge spellbook and three useful PvP pets so it's impossible to just tell you how to generally PvP. But whatever I'll throw some stuff out there.
---
Voidwalker is solid in 1v1s since it's just a ton of extra HP, but you lose battlefield control and utility. Also go through shards faster, have to stop and resummon. Rarely saw use in BGs/group PvP Especially good vs warriors since they can fear immune and the shield rage starves them. 
---
Felhunter is the go-to vs casters or paladins 1v1, and for SM/Ruin or SL is the default pet to use in BGs/group PvP. Interrupting heals and dispelling sheeps off your allies etc is absolutely massive. 
---
Succubus is the go to for destro playstyle and seduce/nuke is a reasonable 1v1 gameplan for SM/Ruin as well. Just decent all around for her CC. Helps you recover easily from being jumped as it is a CC which you don't have to cast and most people aren't aware enough to stop her casts. Suffers from extreme fragility in group PvP though. 
---
Deathcoil into fear is great. But don't use deathcoil unless you need to. It also won't be as much of an i-win button when PvP trinkets come out. 
---
Drain life is useful if you're taking a beating just trying to outlast them (ex. deathcoil down, warrior with zerk rage active in your face). Poor choice without 5/5 Fel Conc and interrupts will lock shadow so Searing Pain is often a better choice in such a scenario though.
---
Was common on pservers. Its faster than "ye" and "y" is often confused with why
---
There may be tons of warriors but I had a couple groups this week where the warrior in the group insisted he couldn‚Äôt tank. I‚Äôm sure many aren‚Äôt tank material.
---
Bring your 60 friends, guildies, etc. to fight their 60s.
---
What else do you need as a ret paladin?
---
Feel good. Elan is great, while your one is a shitty philosopher.
---
Skinning and leatherworking earned me at least 200g between level 27 and 40. I am 40 now with a mount, every druid skill trained, two artisan level professions, 30g spent on BoE gear from the auction house, and 3 respecs behind me. Not everyone is bad at making money.
---
Ah I see, I guess I did turn in the one quest from swamp of sorrows where you need the sleep dust
---
Yea buts let not fool ourselves. They didn't mention it on purpose.
---
No main tank is going to main tank UBRS for a guild of strangers and have no chance at any relevant gear.
---
ClassicAuraDuration just adds a remaining time to your dots, using the default UI
---
The parents made this monster, only they can destroy it
---
I tanked Wrath and Cata and MoP that way.
---
Imagine getting kicked out of your guild because you're too good at /rolling
---
Exhaulted with Graveyard
---
Mafia already got it on lock juheard
---
Drain soul is the ultimate insult.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop this so I‚Äôm using a lesser damaging spell out of spite‚Äù
---
What? No it definitely isn‚Äôt. I have been following Tuk since it was first created
---
I‚Äôm in one called &lt;Girth Quake&gt; thought that was pretttty clever lol
---
it worked on private servers too
---
Rogues are bad against warriors at higher levels, as warriors are the strongest when close to their enemy and rogues don't have much of a choice there. In lower levels, it's more even.
---
You can play whatever in retail because every class is essentially the same at this point thanks to them ruining the class design.
---
&gt;i'm not shaming you for your style.
---
You should go reread your first post bub. When you refer to people's playstyle as "deadweight" and "trashspecs", shaming is exactly what you're doing.
---
Imagine getting kicked out of your guild because you win too many rolls
---
As a tank I'll say at the start to let me know when drinks are needed as I'm not good and estimating every healers ability to heal with and given % of mana.
---
Recklessness + flurry is truly, truly outrageous.
---
At least he waited until you killed the mob. More honor than most.
---
t. twitchtard that just got owned by the opposite faction
---
Can't speak for the Faction but the RP Server is surprisingly welcoming.
---
Shit, you see Alliance Players running through the Barrens and neither side can attack each other. So you just /wave.  Non-PVP servers are weird, man.
---
Just because it works, doesn't mean its good.  Still should go to rogues/warriors.  It's far better for bears than cats, and bears have much better trinkets to use.
---
Usually my faps have at least a 30 min cooldown
---
Stay in lfg search for other tanks then.. Or you know, roll a tank yourself
---
If you're just blissfully exploring and having a good time, you aren't doing it wrong.
---
That would be using her well. Just the same as making sure not to DoT before seduction if you plan on landing a lost cast, or kiting undead until theyve popped WotF to seduce/fear them. Seduction is really swell when it lasts as long as you want it to
---
Don't you see that you are part of the problem here?
---
You are willing to cut you drink short, pop mana potions, and chase after them to keep them alive. You are teaching them that this is a viable way to play.
---
Stop it. High level mana potions will bankrupt you at this rate. Finish your drink. If they die, there's a reason for that, it's their fault. They will learn or go back to LFG and waste their time some more.
---
Slow and steady wins the race.
---
I don‚Äôt
---
Ukrainians and russians in the same grp? Dear god be happy to get kicked before the war broke out.

Good call! Yeah I suppose I wasn't ever wearing one lol

What pisses me off the most is that he acts like nothing is wrong in his daily life. He stresses that he is the happiest he has ever been. He prides himself on being lazy and unmotivated (WHY) and considers this "who he is, and he should be proud of it." He brags about not brushing his teeth for months at a time, and other disgusting behaviors.
---
Its some sort of deep ingrained narcissistic behavior I cannot get through.
---
At the same time, my parents are wholly supportive of him and his hobby, and they always tell the rest of the family that he is doing just fine, nothing is wrong, and that he is living his life to his fullest potential and to leave him alone.
---
I don't think an epiphany is coming. To him, he's seemingly achieved all of his life goals already. Maybe he is really happy and content and I should leave him alone, but I know the story doesn't have a happy ending.
---
I've been using threat plates for threats, and it's been great for keeping track of my dots. The dots are shown above the nameplates of enemies that I'm not even targeting, makes it easy to multi dot and manage.
---
Most impressed by the mug of gravy. 
---
Nothing like washing down chicken nuggets dipped in gravy like a nice mug of gravy.
---
You're pretty much hated by default and have no reason (almost) to change this
---
That's why it's good that they get called out. It's scummy and I won't stand for it.
---
These are my favorite videos on the internet.
---
Not interested in pvp but i didnt know the PvE aspect of eng was so intense. If dont plan to use guns would eng still be the better option. Also my LW is lvl 225 and i HAVENT gotten Artisen yet, should i just stop now and forget it to save the 5G aswell? This is interesting i didnt even think of dropping eng.
---
Chiming in about Earthfury not being dead. Transferred over a week ago and have been happy so far. It has a gradually increasing, but still manageable amount of activity. Herod was beyond badumb.
---
I was using the census addon before Blizzard broke it and it scanned over 11k characters Horde side, excluding level 1s. The realm list used to list it as low until the afternoon, but it seems to be medium most of the day now.  Pop seems balanced. I saw alliance everywhere through the 30s and I stayed away from STV for the most part. 
---
Economy is really good too. I've been selling everything. Stuff stopped selling on Herod pretty quick. Not sure what's up with that.
---
Best of all...NO FUCKING QUEUE! You know they'll open paid transfers later. If realms die, move. I'll be interested to see what happens to the queue for Herod, etc when layering is gone and a new phase rolls out. I'm thinking it's going to be a complete shitshow. Each phase is pretty significant so I think the amount of people that return each time will high.
---
So instead of advertising in the same chat they‚Äôre desperately scanning for a tank and allowing them to pass by you if your loot reservation is seen as unacceptable, you think it makes more sense to message every group looking for a tank in hopes your demands are met?
---
You could put whatever you want in chat and have 20 groups message you. Everyone is always looking for a tank. 
---
This logic isn‚Äôt hard man.
---
Hey if they reserve the gear I'd take equal payment. Which for gear that level would basically buy you an epic mount.
---
Yeah I love the look but it would take me forever and a day to not look too right for the map.
---
Faerlina
---
Aren't you going to need a lot more space on your action bars
---
This statement is so wrong on so many levels haha...
---
Exhaust fans should be on top btw. If you have intake air blowing in through the top you are actually forcing hot air to stay within the tower, keeping the ambient heat trapped.
---
Has anyone checked on u/_Good_One lately? ‚òπÔ∏è I‚Äôm worried.
---
BFD (think thats what you meant) wand is best you can get until high 30s, and its a quest reward so guaranteed, absolutely worth doing (and getting ganked a few times on the way there, probably). SFK Arugal gear is good, plus you have a lock quest that asks you to go to SFK and BFD both so thats convenient. SM Library has the best one-hand dagger for warlocks until I think Stratholme, pairs really well with your warlock quest offhands. Gnomer and Cath both have pretty good helms that you can use until shadoweave mask.
---
PALS FOR LIFE
---
Lol ok, I guess since I‚Äôve turned in a few quests at booty bay
---
Warriors aren't uncrushable without Shield Block. It's prudent on Nef to defense cap for uncrittable during that time though.
---
this'll show them!!!!
---
I'm going to actually agree with you again, it isn't actually a major issue.  However, good luck convincing the bulk of the playerbase.   This is actually the primary reason I'm on a warrior instead of a paladin.  I'd much rather play a ret pally...I actually thoroughly enjoy the seal/judgement mechanic and love having lots of utility....but if I'm going to be forced to play my off-role most of the time in groups I'd much rather be tanking than healing.
---
I tanked BRD at 55  with a Mage, no trouble at all.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Its always the casuals trying to lecture how to play the game.
---
"Dont level too fast you will not enjoy rushing through the leveling phase"
---
"Lets all just play what we like instead of meta speccs"
---
You dont see people that enjoy to level fast or raid efficent tell others that they shouldn't play the way they do. 
---
I dont care if you raid as a fire mage in MC. You do you. I just dont want to group up with me. And stop trying to make me.
---
Crybabies
---
Stay mad child
---
Not if you‚Äôre using toesies
---
Psycho fuckstick jesus christ calm your flabby tits man you're getting cheeto dust everywhere
---
Yes but spell that heal from damage have a pretty low spell dmg coefficient, so dont expect to see huge dmg/healing gains from p1 gear
---
That's exactly what I'm saying.
---
You can establish whatever rules you deem right for your raid/party.
---
If people join then good for you, if they decline of leave when you explain then maybe reconsider.
---
No. It was a level 70 talent in BC. Maybe you are thinking of Vampiric Embrace.
---
Ive lfgd as a tank quite a few times where there werent healers available.   A lot of the priests I see are only looking for spell cleave runs on my server.
---
Bring back DKP. It ruled the looting in raids in vanilla.
---
This, but keep in mind these are very big dungeons with increasing difficulty, and stepping into BRD at 52 guarantees you won't reach the last boss.
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever enjoyed gaming stoned so much lol. This is my first ever experience with WoW as well, been the dopest couple of weeks
---
1-35 is rough
---
Nurse?
---
That is general for anyclass. Warriors do not charge in before tank can get agro. Mages dont cast before tank gets agro. Locks dont dot before tank gets agro. It goes for EVERY dps.
---
I have no idea what's up with it. My guildie who's also a mage is doing it as well. His explanation was "I can't be bothered to constantly make water for people, if people want to pay sure but otherwise I'd rather just keep browsing the AH"
---
The slow moving slimes? Or the ones that explode and leave a death cloud. The slow moving ones you don't tank get a two hander run in Whirlwind and get out. Throw a grenade at them. But don't stand next to them for more then like a second. Also I recommend not using TC it's a waste of rage. Equip a 2 hander. Go to zerker stance pop zerker rage. Go back to battle stance charge in. Back to zerker stance. Use blood rage if needed then WW.  Then swap to shield and dstance. begin shouts and sunder spams. Taunt if needed.
---
I'm a player who started in Bfa and my only thought about classic was "I hope it won't make retail servers dead". Later tho I got sucked in by the hype and MadSeason's videos I now have lvl 40 priest and lvl 44 shaman, enjoying myself more than at any point in retail.
---
All I have is my card. Sorry.
---
Come to smolderweb
---
I guess you're just too stupid to have a reason.
---
Gnome scum
---
I can feel my arteries hardening just looking at it.
---
An extra attack for a Rogue is "basically nothing" too. What's your point?
---
&gt;you don't really need more threat anyway
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPD5q6DC43M
---
this mesopotamian historian woke af
---
Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt then.
---
Except it hasn't been figured out for a while now. Druids couldn't tank in pservers, spellcleaving wasn't so common, etc. Classic isn't 1:1 with private servers that everyone "figured out"
---
Had 90g at 40 and back to 250g at 55. I vendor everything basically.
---
They would not be barren. What do you mean by down in population? Do you know the margin that they reduced? No. You just know that you see "low", "medium", "high", and "full". What you need to know is that Blizzard had said that "Medium" is the size of a full Vanilla server.
---
They wouldn't be barren now. Maybe a few might, but not most of them.
---
Well that I'll say isn't acceptable.. sorry you've had to deal with those but those tanks probably aren't worth half the fee :/ GL in the future my man
---
hope not. I brought my gnome to Teldrasil since level 2 hoping to hit exalted in the 40s for the first cat mount.
---
This was the staff I used for my resto druid before I could get the Will of Arlokk, 15 years ago. It's great.
---
I mean it's annoying as there fewer groups to join, but I don't really mind as long I know it's reserved before I join.
---
Sooo, you just got mounted?  I hope it isn‚Äôt too fast for you - some folks take more time to get mounted because they didn‚Äôt prep properly. 
---
You look good mounted. I‚Äôd ride that.
---
That's a guild problem.
---
Literally every system can be exploited.
---
Don't raid with assholes, they'll fuck you in the butt anyway.
---
If you watch the clip you will see him give examples of why he thinks other people would dislike classic. If it was just a problem of demand, they would have simply said so
---
Don't worry about being good enough, if you whisper someones group that is looking, they will not invite you if you're too low level.  Just follow the tank and try not to pull aggro off him, make sure to attack his main target you'll be good.
---
I'm a gnome fury warrior. I found my own pair of Edgemaster's in BRD. Its the only epic I've found so far.
---
yea i guess. it's just what it is. i drive a pos trashcar. i eat trash fast food on weekends. trash is trash. shame is due where it's due.
---
I always sell Thick Leather for at least double the vendor price. Doesn‚Äôt take longer than 2 hours to sell usually.
---
If a guild asked me to tank for no loot but offered a respectable amount of gold I might be interested. I think that could be a fair system, although you'd have to do like half up front though.
---
So you're an obnoxious loot whore, gotcha.
---
I don't agree.
---
ya it's not hard to do either and if you get like offended or whatever cause someone asks you a question like that's not their fault lol. just say no dude instead of crying about it on Reddit 
---
this sub man is so full of drama queens lol it's awful but like a car crash so I just have to come indulge.
---
I would've liked it more if the other guy drowned.
---
I am leveling Prot.
---
I don't give a shit. I have my entire lifetime to play this game. When I login, I like to tank dungeons and do it well. I'm a very casual player but enjoy reading on tanking technique and enjoy what little time I play the game. When I'm questing, I get into groups and it's fun because I'm always focused on holding aggro. If I need to quest solo, I just do lower-level quests since I'm slowly trying to do ALL of them before moving on to the next zone. I'm level 24 and still stuck in the Barrens.
---
It's a video game. Play it any way you like. Everyone loves a tank. Especially a competent one.
---
It worked in vanilla. Source: did emperor runs after every MC run for our feral offtank.
---
Sorry I came off so judgmental. I took for granted it‚Äôs rather easy to overlook the photo content on a thread like this.
---
It still feels weird that everybody you play with is on your server
---
They are a cancer. Avoid 100%
---
He mentioned the add-on a few comments up. It‚Äôs Wide Quest Log. Alternatively Classic Quest Log does a similar thing.
---
Sorry you got kicked but thanks for posting here, I've never seen this but now I know lol
---
My son is a warrior and he has gold.
---
Because I gave him some.
---
This was so fun! Thanks for putting this together!
---
You can throw those while moving?! Guess you took a *stab* in the dark huh?
---
Mirror
---
Yeah I really enjoy DD. It‚Äôs the server me and my friends chose. What I‚Äôve been doing is adding pretty much every 50+ I see just for future references lol. I see you‚Äôre alliance though so we can‚Äôt ever play together. ;(
---
Prepare to be disappointed. I'm 26 levels into doing the same thing and I'm not close. Also why would OP lie haha
---
That's pretty much exactly what's going to happen. I hit 60 almost a week and a half ago and this mentality has just gotten worse and worse. I'm pretty much full prebis and that was just doing it very slowly. The groups have gotten more and more aggressive as these guilds push harder to be the fastest clear time on the realm. When the reality is we are a LONG way from any new raid content and this rushing is so toxic for the endgame its gonna drive people away. 
---
If any guild leader is reading this (and I'm part of this group as well). Please stop pushing to get into mc/ony so fast, you are causing your members to be stressed out because there's also this weird thing where people think they HAVE to be full prebis to even go in, when that is very much not the case at all.
---
We started at full with 20k queue.
---
That means several vanilla servers worth on people in game and about 4 more servers queued.
---
We are now down to medium.
---
If we started at medium where would we be right now?

I transferred from stonespine to lightbringer, it hasn‚Äôt got a huge population but plenty enough, and I‚Äôve not met a single bad person yet, depends if you like the huuuge servers though
---
I went tailor / enchant. 
---
Bought the white bandit mask recipe.
---
Buy mats to make them from AH
---
Disenchant and sell dust on ah at a profit.
---
Made my mount money at 35 that way but the bottom fell out the market on my server recently. Lots of undercutting on the dusts.

Is there a weaponspeed at which Superior Striking (+5 Dmg) beats Crusader? Specifically talking about Offhandweapon where proccs like Crusader are basline reduced in procc rate.

When they nerfed Demo Shout's threat, they *buffed* Battle Shout's threat by having it no longer split threat between all targets. It's not going to hold aggro against a blizzard right off the bat but it's not bad for getting some initial threat to keep things off your healer.
---
Layering is a feature endorsed by Blizzard.

I‚Äôm Horde on DD. Is there way more alliance or something? I haven‚Äôt really noticed. But there isn‚Äôt a lot of 50+ most are 30-40 so it is a bitch to find anything

It fucking better work, it worked in Vanilla.

Must be nice being able to hit ?? Lvl enemies as a caster lol

100x this. There is a reason it was the preferred farm for the Chinese rogues working for gold website.

bro just get Questie the addon it tells u everything where to go for quests! You can even msg me and ill help you install it!
---
No it‚Äôs not lol
---
lol
---
Keep at if!  Druid a bit slow until you get bear form at level 10 (maybe 11-12 as horde if you are new to the game).
---
Once you hit that point you will be good.  Farm mobs 1-3 levels below you and try your best to outlevel your quests until then so they are easier.
---
The bow off Illidan was better for hunters anyway. The legendary bow didn't have enough dps to make up for the dps lost from not using the best ammo.
---
I dont know the exact numbers eng adds to pve, I  know it's not a huge increase at all but it is an increase. I say just to look into more before paying the 5g. I personally wouldn't go further in lw, and if you dont want to do eng you can still get another gathering profession for making money. But it's completely up to you. You can always keep lw and make some decent gear that isnt bis but is still good, you can also make gear for alts or guild mates.
---
Nice edit.  Your original post said absolutely nothing.  I play druid you dumbass.
---
So today he add me to a group, then when i accepted he kick me, maybe he is tracking my location to beat up my dad or something

I'll tap my whole health bar away so I can use food instead of water but healers sometimes panic heal me to full. I honestly don't expect healers to save me from killing myself with taps but they seem to assume that I expect it.
---
Bet he keeps his stash by the laptop
---
Reserving loot is just a less restrictive way of not inviting people who would compete with your for loot.
---
Of course if you're reserving tank or healer loot GL actually forming a group, but I'm sure they'll figure that out eventually.
---
After taking time to think about it, I guess we‚Äôre kinda conditioned for it. There‚Äôs all sorts of studies about how we process what we see when we are looking for certain things. If true, it‚Äôs possible a lot of people on this thread probably never even realized what the photo even was.
---
Then people complain when I call them neckbeards in game.

Probably was sat there thinking, well wtf is this. Hahaha

so how do you enable it? :/

So woke, so righteous.  /s

Is that Sony STB at the bottom a DVD player + 5.1 surround sound?
---
Yeah we should all just post memes instead of discussing aspects of the game like some sort of... discussion board right?
---
Go away. You wanna call people drama queens for discussing their opinions on aspects of the game then I guess everyone who posts is a drama queen.
---
I guess there are piece of shit players on the horde as well
---
I sold a bunch of stacks of invis pots for 30-40s a piece. That made me 20g pretty quick, but now prices are driven so low, I'm holding onto like 100 more pots lol.
---
Rogues are ST kings when it comes to dmg. Since we have 0 AoE in classic. (Blade Flurry hardly counts)
---
Stop everything, become an undead warlock.
---
Alternatively, if your gold is unlimited (for comps since you're going blacksmith/engi) and you're planning on playing pvp, go ahead. It's not worth it for raiding as your 2 trinket slots will eventually be needed for better gear.
---
Ah, correct. Enslave translates to same word as mind control in my language so I mixed them up.
---
I've played both stonespire and Gehennas. Both seem fine thought SS less full.
---
Always get the odd prick everywhere you go tho
---
That's not a good representation. Queues should not be counted because not everyone is willing to sit in queue every day they want to play. They're going to switch to a different server or wait until the queues go away.
---
While I understand why you use it as a comparison, it's meaningless for player retention.

Again I have not once stated that Naxx is super difficult.  My only point is that it is nothing like LFR.  Take 40 random people and drop them in Naxx without voice comms and I absolutely 100% gaurentee you it would be a complete shit show.  It has nothing to do with difficultly and everything to do with coordination and preparedness.  I don't see how my response is definsive, it is simply stating the reality that they are not comparable.  Again I did not even use the word difficulty in that statement.

Hey man I love the setup but just FYI the heat is supposed to be exiting through the top so you might have better luck flipping that fan around so it‚Äôs pulling the air out!

He's so druid so, good chance he resists it

Yeah this made me write his entire comment off after reading that ignorant garbage.

Top tip. Go to desolace shadowprey village. Jump off the pier by the flight path and farm the shellfish cages. 55s per hand in of 5 shellfish with the troll fisherman on the pier. 
---
Works out about 12g a hour. And you get big iron pole drops randomly that sell for 60s to 1g on ah as well as random greens now and then.

Could that mean other on hit effects work for druids?

There is no anti stun trinket :) hence Orc.
---
I'll be raiding more than BGs but will be in them and wpvp. Thanks for the response.
---
Thanks man, appreciate the offer. But I feel like it would marr the experience of exploring azeroth. I like figuring out what is where and where to go. I only play a couple hours at a time a few nights a week. And when I do I look forward to the fact that i will be exploring a new area.
---
Pretty sure this is how it worked on pservers. Even if you were out of range / on a roof or something, the guards had an ability that would knock you back like 10 yards and they'd just spam it on you until you were in a place where they could reach you.
---
PVE, leveling demonology mostly solo.  Succubus or voidwalker for better results?
---
Depends on what you're playing, and by that I mean how fast you can solo them. As a hunter, you're probably three times faster than I am, so you could potentially snag a few here and there. As a resto druid, I can technically solo them, but it takes so long, I get killed by some horde rogue in the meantime.
---
This'll make things easier for a while.  Congrats.
---
It actually probably helped us out.  3/5 of the group was guildies.  We definitely were too low to be able to do the final boss.  When we came back our tank never came back so some random lvl 60 pally joined and we did it.  The d/c saved us haha.
---
Why would you precast wotf? You pre cast .5 sec early let‚Äôs say, lock insta casts deathcoil out of stun and you are death coiled for 3 seconds through your Wotf. By the time the coil is up, your far away from the lock, you have at most 1.5 secs of wotf left and the lock got two global off so you have corruption and agony ticking you away preventing vanishes.
---
Lock starts casting fear and fear lands as soon as your wotf expires and you‚Äôre fucked.
---
Low level item prices are tied to enchanting mats prices.
---
Reasons I play on an RP server. 
---
Sure it's not efficient, but if it's your RP (Like my Ice Troll Frost mage never learning fire spells) then not much can be done about it
---
So when leveling from 53-60 in WPL I gathered about 100 stacks of runecloth and [650g](https://imgur.com/a/9t5kFV5). Prior to turning in those stacks, I started the rep grind with 2k left to reach honored so that means i had to get a total of 29,000 rep with the trolls. Divide that by 50 and that leads me with 580 stacks to reach exalted.
---
I bought any stack of runecloth on the AH under 1.5g which turns into roughly 700g to buy all the stacks. This was purely funded by my lucky drops when grinding humanoids 53-60 and those devilsaur leathers. It took me about 4 days to buy all the runecloth I could then another 2 days to earn 400g to reach the 918g. It wasnt too bad honestly since the devilsaur market was nuts when I first turned 60, but now its getting more and more contested every day. Hope this helps any of you out there looking to do this!
---
This ain't no ice cream social.
---
No way??
---
I think the OP blocked me,  otherwise I'd reply to their incorrect statement below.  On hit effects typically work for feral, but weapon buff effects don't.  If you get something like Heart of Wyrmthalak, for example, it will proc on your feral attacks.
---
I shot an arrow but missed.
---
The burst oneshots just make it kind of addictive. Though I would say shamans below 40 might be the weakest class in PvP.
---
Its because noone wants to spend 3 hours and not get what they want guaranteed and it also might not even drop.
---
It sucks but its natural to not want to feel like you wasted time.
---
New to druid, got any useful Druid Macros that I might need later on?
---
Me2 works great in both dungeons and solo pve
---
Just remind them that you are not healing them unless they have direct aggro.
---
They have many ways to get health back. I have a Warlock alt and never expect the healer to top me off (and most waste their mana trying still).
---
I also main a healer.  I'll pass a warlock a regen when I have great mana or on downtimes to help speed up their DPS, otherwise they accept the risk IMO.
---
Exactly what I was hoping for, thank you!
---
Sounds valid
---
Gravy on chicken is disgusting?
---
Why don't warriors have any gold?
---
I am not sure any realm have a nice community tbh, I can't remember if it was this bad during vanilla, but the amount of toxicity is so damn high, atleast at level 60.
---
;)
---
As a tank, I always keep an eye on the healers mana. I have noticed that some healers run out of mana faster than others, some are good for like 5-6 chain pulls in a row, and others are basically OOM after one. Is downcasting still a thing? Maybe check your overhealing? Not saying it's you, of course, I've been in those groups where DPS is trying to rush me and do their own pulls, but if you aren't and it helps?  
---
DPS on the other hand, IDGAF about your mana in a 5 man against trash, if you sit there and drink during the trash pull works for me, if you want to keep going with low mana works for me.
---
Cookie cutter = get the job done effectively

Lazy? I think you mean smartest! I play on a TV too and I WISH I had a setup that looks this nice!

No its the bad players lmao.

You can be the nicest dude ever that's not gonna make up for you refusing to play right.

when you're lvl 44 in the video hows your talent tree look like?

I managed EP/GP for a guild I was raid leader in.

It worked well, with just one addendum: priority order, BIS &gt; Upgrade &gt; Offspec and class leaders in charge to survey people to avoid upgrades going for offspec.
---
&lt;The Murlocalypse&gt;
---
Good info! I'll pass it on to my druid buddy's :) more competition but I like BRD
---
I literally just bought 600g in Runecloth, and another 918g on a mount today. That was my second epic mount. People do have money to spend, just not everyone.
---
As they should be.  Beyond that reserve list being scummy... they're also straight up retarded to think you'd be cool with that.   Don't play with assholes nor idiots and they're both.
---
&gt; Classic has made me hate the alliance so much
---
Dude, that's shitty but faction does not matter at all. This happens on both sides, there are assholes everywhere. It's about numbers and advantage. Just ask any Ally from Skeram how the horde treated them there.
---
You figured it out. Now shuddaaap!
---
I'm literally - right now.
---
I have the same predicament.
---
I want to mainly PvP as arms.
---
I need to farm UBRS, 5 mans, Ony, and MC to get the best arms gear.
---
I need to spec Fury to get spots in UBRS, Ony, and MC.
---
I need BiS fury gear to be effective in those raids.
---
Do I spec fury but only roll on arms pvp gear? Or do I collect all the bis fury gear and then start collecting arms gear?
---
May a keybind that spams /oom  and problem solved.
---
I have a serious question. How are you liking it as a new person to WoW?
---
I only ask because I played from Vanilla to Cataclysm. I saw what was considered the best of WoW and (what I consider) the decline of WoW.
---
I have a few friends who have never played that are interested in it but all they hear is the negativity of WoW in general.
---
Haven‚Äôt played retail for more than a year, do you think  there a lot of stubborn players from retail who refuse to even try Classic?
---
This whole trend of reserving loot is sad and just needs to disappear entirely imo. When and how did this nonsense become acceptable?
---
This.  Go all out if you can it's usually worth the risk.  Very few times have I eaten shit for multimobbing.
---
Can easily do 4 mobs at once while swapping in a new 4th when one dies.
---
But what makes them feel like they deserve it more than anyone else? Why should a tank get the right to naturally get all the tank gear, plus whatever dps gear they desire?
---
Nobody wants to waste time, but grinding is one of the things everyone talked about with classic. How nothing came easy, but suddenly everyone with leverage (tank, Ubrs key etc) think everything should come easy to them.
---
I got here too late to make a rose colored glasses joke... Big F
---
For Azeroth
---
I'm glad I outleveled everyone for the most part on rattlegore I hit 37 and no-one was in BL with me I got him for free basically sadly I rerolled to shaman.
---
You even lose them for distracting something you aren‚Äôt hitting without ever touching another target.
---
+1, played hardcore to 60, now all i can do is some quests for gold/item, farm ubrs for bis that didnt drop for 15 runs and do mc once a week, not very fun.
---
Man, check my previous comment. I believe put of the 500 people I've met on flamelash, less than 20 were rude(or maybe just kids) and only 1 has made it to my ignore list. And I can assure you I've made it to at least 1 ignore list. It's just statstics.
---
Experiment and let us know.
---
I assume any run I'm invited too to tank has something high value on reserve.
---
My typical format is to immediately respond to any whisper is with a replay asking if X item is reserved, if it's not I'll happily join, if it is reserved I decline.
---
Don't put all the blame on the people making the group, there is personal responsability that could have saved your 30 minutes.
---
Arugal?
---
I don't think many people are playing the long game right now.
---
I think paying is fine if you're desperate and they need NOTHING from the run.  Because otherwise you won't be able to run because there's 0 reason for them to join.
---
It shouldn't be standard but on a rare occasion it makes sense to hire someone for their time.
---
ah snap, i am just a few more levels away from being able to craft it, however I bought it like 2 weeks ago. I've been making good money with the Azure Shoulders though!
---
The real punishment is when their account gets "hacked" in 6 months and a gold farmer ninjas everything in their bank and vendors all their gear.
---
Yeah but I mean, vendor price is a bit much. Why would one hit up a mage for vendor priced water?
---
50 Silver is alright imo though.
---
Ok. Don't count queues.  
---
Servers once full are now on medium. So a server that a launch had 4-5 times the population of an old vanilla realm now is down to vanilla levels of people.  
---
IF said server started at vanilla levels at launch, what would be the situation now?  
---
If instead of 18 English PVP servers (on EU) each with 4-5 layers, they started with 70-90 servers, how would their population look now?
---
I have addon that yells in chat when im low on mana automatically
---
Crossroads cream pie
---
thank you for the tips ill just farm more to level up some im doing quests at level rn
---
That is why I will preemtivly whisper UBRS groups with "60 Rogue, no interest in Dalrends." to tripple my chance for an invite from the start. 200 Gold for a Krolblade is really not that much at 60 (even if you gotta haggle for a bit to get it down to 200)  
---
But in regards to one claim of yours, rogues aren't that good at avoiding ganks. Most classes have some sort of dot or stealth deny and no one can be bothered to move around the map at 70% movementspeed instead of being on your mount at 200%. A more reasonable claim would be "Rogues can gank better than anyone else."
---
I might be missing something but is the text in the video any different from what you can enable in Interface Options -&gt; Combat? It has checkboxes for all the stuff you mentioned AFAIK
---
Dropping 40 people into naxx would be just like LFR. 2 people telling everyone else what to do and wrangling those players to do it.
---
You can be butthurt all you want while farming pots and flasks but at the end of the day Kel thuzad is no harder than any LFR boss in a current raid tier.
---
I haven‚Äôt been this addicted to a game since vanilla-wotlk and it‚Äôs just as addicting if not more. I can‚Äôt wait to play every day.
---
Haha what? Good lord I know tanking is in demand right now but if you want to roll on things I‚Äôm sure as shit not paying you as well. Plenty of tanks who need to come for gear willing to go along, not to mention that you just find a decent guild and there‚Äôs tanks there.
---
I remember this attitude from tanks when LFG came out in wrath... they had instant queues and gave no shits so just pulled everything, needed on everything, and fuck you if you don‚Äôt like it. Posts on forums were all about how tanks were so amazing and would be off raiding while all the scrubs were still trying to gear up so deal with it.
---
Fun fact: tanking is important but also one of the least sought after roles in end game. Vast majority of end game guilds get their tank roster locked in early and keep it... not at all uncommon for the core and most dedicated players who are *not* leaving to take the job. All these tanks thinking they‚Äôre hot shit are having a great time now but it really won‚Äôt be long before finding a tank for any dungeon is super easy and every raid has theirs already.
---
Be a nice tank now, the tables will turn and you don‚Äôt want a shitty rep when they do.
---
The efficiency of juggling depends heavily on mob density and mob HP vs your DoT damage. Overpulling reduces efficiency. Mobs with too much HP so DoTs dont even come close to killing them while they run around feared reduces efficiency. You do it when the conditions are conducive to it.
---
they do, on pserver it was usual that the firsts (from 1 to all of them lol) orb of righteous were given to tank

There is a cooldown on switching layers. It really isn't abuseable past the first switch.

Any good reason to grind rep with Argent Dawn?  Im a mage.  Not sure if they have any items worth grinding for.

What is the song in the video? It sounds very familiar but I can't put my finger on it.

I would tap once or twice and drain life or soul at the end of fights personally.
---
Despite the fact that witch hunts have always been massive failures in the past I'm sure yours will be successful.
---
iirc each raid team would ideally take one arms warrior for certain debuffs or something so if ur lucky and can get a spot in a guild no respeccing necessary otherwise getting prebis gear as arms is easy and then waiting till pvp gear is dropped if you don‚Äôt want to respecc constantly
---
I did it on purpose if im honest, just went slow to make sur ei had max rage for execute phase. Hence the massive spike.
---
Gotta get that 3 monitor setup man. 1 for WoW, 2nd for Netflix/Hulu, 3rd for Chrome/Firefox to look anything up for the game super quick.
---
People will defend this under the basis that they are fine with it so long as loot rules/reserved loot is announced immediately. However, they fail to realise that the players joining those raids *despite reservations*, are also being taken away from potential raids without any reservations. This makes it harder for players who play classes and roles reliant upon certain key pieces of gear that are often reserved.
---
Found the audio:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTelnNmRUH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTelnNmRUH0) also nice dps mate :D

Use immolate for your pulls, otherwise not worth casting unless its a boss mob.  Very useful when pulling though even when pulling multiples.  Pulls with it, then use your instacast corruption and curse dots.. even when you're tagging a new mob to multimob make sure when you pull you cast immolate.
---
I have a better idea, let's award it an Emmy!
---
I just keep massively undercutting those people. They seem to think there is a BG twink community for them to sell too and I'm sure there will be one in the nearish future once we get BG's added but in the meantime they are wasting everyone's time asking for 10 gold for a level 30 BOE blue.
---
FUUUUCK YEAH! GIMME DAT SHIZ!
---
It‚Äôs a massive multiplayer open world game where you can kill shit and do quests. The dungeons are like PVE Overwatch. Retail is the same, but I like Classic better because it‚Äôs much more simple to get into for new players and there‚Äôs not all of the gimmicks that they‚Äôve added over the years. Plus, it‚Äôs fun to level up alongside other people instead of being the only low level that isn‚Äôt on an alt.
