The Jabberwocky has found its way to r/classicwow! 
---

---
Quick!
---
Bring me thy Vorpal Blade!
---
---
---
Is that even ported to Classic? If so please link :)
---
I’d ask why they don’t bring back pvp vendors
---
Why do people try to make this argument? AddOns were prevelant in classic as well.
---
Damn boy, there will be no 60s at launch, stop spreading the hate!
---
Zygor is not alliance only.
---
That works too, then you will know because you can’t duplicate that name (streamers name), therefore you know they are in that server and you can leave to another.
---
Sorry for the stupid question but does this mean vanilla addons won’t work with classic?
---
That's awesome. Thanks for sharing
---
You really have zero idea what you are talking about.
---
Yes, I prefer to be a caster and kite rather than melee and have to stick on my target.
---
Doesn't mean they are necessarily... you can play BFA with no addons - Omegalul
---
The disconnect you're making here is not distinguishing between active and passive WPVP.
---
Sure, battlegrounds may have put a big dent in people going out into the world looking for trouble, but they have no real impact on spontaneous WPVP, which is what flying undermines. Safety is no longer a concern when you can just mount up and fly somewhere safe or just hang out high up in the air while you AFK for a bit. It's on-demand safety. It also makes WPVP griefing even more one-sided and easy to accomplish since a max-level player who has played enough to get flying can just swoop down on levelers or freshly capped plebs who don't have flying yet. It's just completely lopsided. At least on the ground you have a chance to spot the incoming ganker and hide or get away before you become a victim instead of getting dive bombed.
---
Hunter can be used to pull large packs for spellcleave.  You don't even know if it's good but you say hunters won't want to do it?  Why argue when you have no idea what is going on?
---
Dude you're freaking epic
---
Because the method isn't well documented yet and I didn't play the beta yes.
---
Lol, I have it a little easier than you think. My mouse has two buttons where the thumb sits. I have Alt and Ctrl mapped to them.
---
&gt; From what I've seen they are especially disliked in dungeons because of lack of normal ressurection 
---
This will not matter for the most part. Unless you join ultra hardcore dungeon groups only consisting of pure dps classes, which are not really desirable.
---
There are gonna be enough shadow priests, enh/ele shaman and ret/tank paladins willing to do dungeons for having at least 1 normal rez player. And worst case scenario, well you can still go back in the instance on foot. That's what happens when the group wipes anyway. Most people won't let the healer go back solo to rez everyone because they're lazy
---
As for the part of your post when you talk about druid demand etc, as many other said, you're gonna be fine. Most people don't play a class for its efficiency, but because of subjective appreciation of several aspects of the class. Therefore they won't even have those thoughts going through their head. They'll just take you. This is 100% true for dungeons.
---
For raids it's very likely that most guilds on all servers will be casual and struggle to find 40 regular players, meaning 8-10 healer that show up. So again, unless you aim for hardcore groups, server firsts or speedrunning content faster in average, you don't need to worry. Everyone can find like-minded people, whether you're hardcore/topTierClass or not.
---
Cool story.
---
What's with this excessive omegaluling, this is next level Cringe.
---
It is well documented, you just don't know it.  Do some research.
---
It coincided with my birthday so I'm taking the week off. 
---
I am going to pick up *several bags* of pizza bites but I'll mostly drink water. Also going to try to get to the gym and do some cleaning.
---
Right i'll tell my guild to give me 10k gold so I can respec and buy lots of consumables and hit rank14, guilds love to show off their r14..
---
Death in 4 hours from heart stoppage.
---
Troll
---
That’s why you don’t simulate, you test some uh candidates....
---
But why do you have the need to tell that to a person, that clearly states he wants to use addons?
---
Doing things efficiently is not laziness..
---
Cringey!
---
I'll be recreating my originals as alts. Hoping to focus on Druid as main, for literally the first time ever.
---
1) There aren't many tanks in the guild and they do all need gear. You'll get geared quickly.
---
2) Most will roll 2-3 warriors and a feral, with fury DPS equipping shields and going tank stance for bosses that demand more.
---
3) If you're a warrior: Nightfall/Annihilator duty. Both are very important and are really good on offtanks. Also make sure Thunderclap and Demoshout are on, Battleshout is active, debuff/buff management is important and while you have 39 others, you're one of them, make sure you do your part!
---
4) For the most part, you can just go Deep Prot and later on go Fury/Prot if your guild is fine with it, just like the MT, to increase your threat. 
---
5) I have not Offtanked in Vanilla, but am really looking forward to it. I've tanked in many other MMOs and have done excessive research, and have off-tanked in several expansions and it's really enjoyable. 
---
6) Be there for (close to) every raid, make friends in your guild so you can exchange consumables between each other (tanks need most consumables on hand, farming em yourself is really demanding) and you'll be fine time-wise. 
---
7) Skarm is an awesome source for all things tank, both feral + Warrior, can highly recommend him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSzLn3iRK-g
---
taking Tue/wed off. then half days thurs/friday. hoping to be like 45+ after labor day.
---
sounds about right.
---
Sure, [here](https://i.imgur.com/YxKYhzr.jpg) you go! It's nothing special though
---
Class distribution looks assurigly even.
---
He played it back then I remember him talking how he was flexing with the ragnaros hammer in Orgrimmar
---
Yeah and I bet his name is Thex.
---
If we're going the Classic+ route, you could also tone down already existing raid gear by making it scale a bit less crazily, while adjusting for balance.
---
Would be *really* tough to do and upset a lot of people if done wrongly, but is an option. Probably not the best one, but alas, that'd make sure you can add a T4-6 easily.
---
If you max skinning on your way to 60 as a hunter/warlock. You can kill the elite dragons in burning steppes and Devilsaurs in ungoro for some valuable leather working mats to AH.
---
Unless he and his friend level slow, and take a long time to hit 60, its going to be a while before there are level 60's out ganking low levels. His experience for at least the first couple weeks should be camp-less
---
Stupid comparison. Compare it to TF.
---
I played a warrior back in vanilla, and remember how utterly slow that grind was I’m not going to relive it. From alliance warrior to horde Druid I go.
---
&gt;PVE rotations should be interesting at the cost of everything else class design wise
---
Yeah, I love raiding but fuck that hard.
---
I don't play the same class, the same race or the same faction. I want something new
---
I'm almost 100% certain this is how it will work
---
I literally just described every arena battle, ever. From the lowliest noob like you, to top tier player's like OrangeMarmalade. You are critiquing yourself, lol.
---
Thanks! I like your idea and makes sense. I'm too old to be min maxing anyways with less playtime than back in original vanilla :)
---
Each boss in Molten Core drops 1-3 items, probably closer to 2.5 on average. Add in BoEs dropping 1-3 per run means there is around 28 epic drops per run. So around 75% of the raid is getting one item. This isn't considering recipes, gathering, disenchanting, etc. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Unfortunately, because of random number generation I believe it is hard to get a full tier set unless you were in a high-end guild....and were lucky. 
---
The matters gets more complicated when you start considering that many BiS gear may not come from a current raid, but rather dungeons, quests, etc.
---
Napkin mathed it the other day and if you have to make yourself and 4 friends (my friends group is playing together) 5 [Runecloth Bag]s each it would take about 52 minutes of casting time just to craft them. That's counting crafting the [Bolt of Runecloth] for them in the craft time.
---
I hope they will at the last stress test.
---
I hope it works for you, I tried to check out the leveling guide but I hated it. Either way, enjoy a month off from work :)
---
PSA: Mage AoE grinding will be significantly harder/less profitable on Classic than it is on Private servers. The Melee Leeway also works for mobs...
---
Ah
---
Cries in rogue*
---
casinos are legit if you state and follow the rules before they hand the g over.
---
My thinking is just calling it Arthas will attract people outside of WoW fans, and his story is good enough to keep them interested for future movies
---
Ah makes sense... scams.
---
I'm aware of this, I've only ever played Classic. Mages are still viable for AoE grinding certain materials and reagents.
---
losers
---
The exploration "trick" is literally a pserver meme to get people out of the starting zones on launch day so there's less competition for mobs.
---
Nah, I did that on a private server when I thought it was likely to be the final time ever to have a chance to play the game.
---
Boring? Tell me everything. After getting owned by so many stunlock rogues, I’d say stealthers are on my list of maybes. Just never got around to playing one until BC
---
I used to call my aunt on the phone to tell her to log on to protect Crossroads since it always got attacked. (she never seemed to care, eventually I got her account and I still play on it to this day)
---
My first character was a Tauren Warrior. I was like 11 at the time. I am not going through that pain again. I enjoyed parts of it dont get me wrong.  I did get to 60 and enjoyed tanking but it just doesn't fit me nowadays. Good luck to the warriors out there. Dont suck at tanking.
---
Here's a couple of tips from the beta.
---
1) Get a leveling friend. There will be a few quests were you will need help of another person. Having an extra person also makes life easier for you if you are a class that is gear dependent (like a warrior). This also helps against bad luck.
---
Oh, what's bad luck? Rarely, when you fight a mob that is around your level (+/-), you will encounter what I call "bad luck". That is, you'll get a string of misses, either dodges, parries, misses, blocks, etc. This happens even if you're 2+ levels over them. It's just "bad luck". In some situations this will kill you. Having a partner helps mitigate this. 
---
2) Practice kiting mobs. Not kiting in the traditional sense of using slows to deal damage without being hit. I mean kiting by pulling specific mobs out of groups. Here's how you do it. First, tag the mob you want from as far away as possible. This will usually aggro the whole group. No problem. Start to run while still tagging that mob as you go. After about 20 or 30 feet, the mobs you have not tagged will turn around and reset while the mob you want will stick with you. This is the easiest way to deal with packs of mobs if space allows. 
---
3) Dynamic respawns do not exist. Drop rates are often terrible for certain quests. Quests like getting the armbands from the gnolls in Elywn Forest is not worth your time, as an example. Keep that in mind when deciding if you should stick it out on a quest, or just go grind somewhere. 
---
4) There is going to be a massive influx of greens on the AH. If you are struggling, or a class that needs gear (like a warrior), check the AH on occasion. Supply should be higher than demand, and you will likely be able to afford the greens from the AH. At least a piece or two to help you as you level.
---
5) Follow guides online to help you level. Out of the way and "unpopular" zones might be beneficial to your leveling experience if you go out to them, but then again, others may have the same idea. 
---
***CLASS SPECIFIC LEVELING TIPS***
---
1) Druid - by far the worst starting out. You basically go oom after about 2 mobs. It's very frustrating and slow. Having a partner helps to mitigate this, and things pick up around level 6 or so. Things get ***really*** nice once you get bear at 10, but it requires some leg work. You are the true hybrid and can do most roles well enough while leveling. Nice.
---
Hunter - not too bad starting out, but you don't get real good until your pet at level 10. Having a partner also helps here since you are more likely to stay in range with your ranged weapon if you have one. Practice shooting and running away. You have an auto shot timer, get used to "kiting" with it. 
---
Mage - Like the druid, you go oom pretty quick. The difference here is that you are still very bursty and can kill shit quick, but it's expensive mana wise which means downtime often. GET A WAND ASAP. I repeat. GET A WAND ASAP. A wand is a ***major*** help in managing your mana and downtime. You need to get a wand ASAP. Seriously, ASAP. 
---
Paladin - Listen, paladin is boring AF leveling, although you're probably one of the most "sturdy" classes while leveling. It's also appealing to be a pretty decent supporting character. Every class should get First Aid while leveling and paladin benefits greatly here. Alternate using First Aid and your healing spells while leveling to reduce downtime. Very helpful here. 
---
You benefit greatly from having a partner here too, but be warned. You are a subpar almost non-existent tank. You can sort of kind of tank instances later on, but you'll be absolutely garbage at it since you literally do not have the spells to make it work (no taunt, no real aoe, no mitigation, etc). 
---
Priest - much like the druid and mage, you go oom quickly. Get a wand ASAP! I didn't really play them much because they have a good bit of downtime at the start. Got bored lol.
---
Rogue - DO NOT BOTHER TRYING TO USE STEALTH TO ATTACK MOBS AT LOW LEVELS. You move way too slowly and often get caught anyway. It. Is. Not. Worth. Stick to using your throwing weapon to pull mobs to you. It actually does a good bit of damage. You also benefit greatly from a partner because they can hold aggro, and you can get backstabs in. A rogue partner could prove beneficial here since you can just backstab back to back (little rogue joke here).
---
Shaman - Totem camps! This doesn't really come into play until later, but "setting up shop" around an area of mobs and then pulling mobs to you (rank 1 lightning bolt!) is a great way to minimize downtime and get shit done. Totems are powerful, but that power comes at a cost in both mana and time spent casting (it takes 6 seconds to cast all four totems!) Early on I suggest using a two handed weapon (staves!) since you'll do a little bit more damage that way, and thus kill things faster. 
---
Warlock - the easiest class to level 1-10 by far. No other class even compares here. It's not even close. They have insane health regen at the start, and they do a good bit of damage by way of dots, so you don't even really have to "participate". Your goal should be to have two mobs dotted at all times while leveling (and they'll usually die within those two dots). See a mob, dot it up, get your pet on it and run to the next mob or area. Once you get fear you can fear juggle. You benefit from having a partner, but it's not required. Seriously, it's so easy it's a joke. Getting a wand is also important, but you won't see any real issue with downtime etc, until you hit 10, which I think is a thing for pretty much all the classes. 
---
Warrior - some say it's bad, and well, it isn't really. Sword and board is, IMO, the best way to level here. You gain rage mainly by actually hitting the target, not from the damage dealt and you don't get much rage for damage dealt to you. In fact, I don't think you gain much of any rage from normal mobs hitting you (that I've seen). So hitting faster is typically better and a 1h weapon and shield will help with that. But of course, I could be wrong. Didn't spend that much time. 
---
Again, you benefit greatly from a partner here as you have no real escape mechanic and you are terribly gear dependent. You'll do fine in the leveling zone though, just make sure you pick up First Aid as that's your only means of healing. Honestly, every class should have it anyway, even if you can already heal. 
---
You'll get the feel of how to level as you go.
---
I'm willing to bet $50 that this sub reddit is going to be in flames when the game gets released because people don't remember how it played
---
No confirmation yet just have to wait it out for now
---
I'll be leveling a rogue first as my primary (mining/skinning) farmer, then a hunter as my secondary (herbalism/leatherworking/fishing/cooking). When I start my priest, paladin, mage, and druid later their bags and bank slots will already be full with raw materials for their double production professions. I like to be as self sufficient as possible.
---
Red green blue?
---
Coming from the guy telling me how to play the game lol
---
It’s funny that I’m even debating profs on the war too. Probably herb/alch again but bs/mining always seemed fun.
---
thats the spirit
---
I went staff with rockbiter all the way to 30.
---
1-10 white staff 
---
10-20 staff of ogr/cauldron stirrer
---
20-30 crescent staff 
---
I focused on agility and stam with some intellect.
---
Stoneskin and searing totem only. Pull with rank 1 LB. flame shock.
---
Crit flurried my way to 30 really quickly. Rockbiter staff thumper crits are satisfying. If you Crit you take off nearly 50% of a mobs life.
---
Thanks!
---
With the assumed decreased difficulty of retail classic to private server raiding - will it be feasible to do molten core with like 2/3rds random people and 1/3rd guildies a few months in?
---
Yep, made so much cash back then, too bad it's probably just going to get insta reported by some softy who loses a little gold.  Gotta learn that gambling is risky somewhere... why not in WoW.
---
If you know can you link to info?
---
You described it to a T... stunlock - and that's it. Boring.
---
Oh so the STV AH isn’t cross faction?
---
Mine was tailoring/enchanting and I know I am going to be asking myself why I went down the enchanting path yet again...
---
if you got a bunch of dudes over might as well grill
---
could always take turns checking on it
---
I don't play retail. I haven't for a long long time. 
---
You are just lacking vision. I know the current version of GS is garbage and doesn't actually say anything about gear, however earlier up in the post I explained how you can make GS work as a perfect indicator of gear, just use stats values from spreadsheets like this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVcmgixKaP9LC-rrqS4D2rojIz48KwKA8QBmJloX1h7f8BkUloVuiw19eR2U5WvVT4InYgnPunUo49/pubhtml# linked with class and spec and you got yourself a near flawless GS system that will probably beat even the most experienced raid leaders in determining gear level, and it only takes a second. 
---
I'm not saying you need this high level of standard of your gear, I'm not expecting anyone to be fully decked out. That's why the gearscore system is perfect for the job. Say the average green geared fresh 60 has a GS of 150, and fully prebis is 450, I could say "/4 LFM MC 300GS req" . Easy as that.
---
Nobody wants to admit they want to play a night elf. We're going to hear lots of unnecessary excuses come launch day.
---
Because it's a video game and if you scam someone, you have every right to be suspended.
---
Didnt broken tooth get nerfed with the patch? if this is 1.12, then isn't broken tooth nerfed?
---
I remember camping him forever until he spawned. I got to use him for a long time before he was nerfed
---
Will people get mad at me if I roll need on valuable world BOE epics that drop which I can't use? The way I see it is BOE items are basically gold and I can easily sell one on the AH for the gold to buy an item I can use, so really everyone should need them since the gold is potentially an upgrade for all classes...   
---
Would informing people i plan to roll need on BOE world epics if they drop mean people wouldn't want to run with me?
---
oop mistyped RNG
---
And rank 14 isn't guild status symbol? If I see a rank14 player in a guild I know that guild kicks some serious ass. If I see a sulfuras player in a guild I'm thinking damn that guy must've farmed gold for months.
---
And no dungeon finder.  Just a lot of time in chat “LFG: &lt;dungeon&gt;”. 
---
Get a group of friends each in the right role and you can grind fast this way as long as everyone keeps running.
---
[removed]
---
Send me 100isk...er gold, and I'll triple it!
---
Only reason you scam is when you don't pay up if they roll high enough.
---
Is there a preferred route based on race? What if a friend is leveling a NE and I’m leveling a human and another friend is Dwarf/Gnome. Should we all meet up somewhere at lvl 1 or just meet up at 10-15 in one particular zone
---
Yeah I get you. I will play classic so much I will indeed feel weary.
---
I originally played rogue. Later on I tried priest and found that I really enjoyed healing in 5-man dungeons, so I'm taking the beset of both worlds and playing druid this time.
---
Instead of what, Deflection? Nah, not nearly worth it. Mobs are always hitting you and the Parry is oustanding for leveling. It's all about less downtime. Similar to why I would not recommend putting 1%+ to 2H Weapons... because minmaxing a percentage is less important as you grind than the utility of something like extra Rage on Charge or having more % on Parry which helps your survivability in quests and wpvp, as well as if you choose to go tank a dungeon. That talent is great for raiding Fury but while leveling it's kind of meh, since Heroic Strike in general is a pig for rage utilization - it's like ... now it's asking for Talent Points too? pfft, nah, there's better choices.
---
Go druid 😄
---
I'm fairly confident LFD would easily pass a poll. It's basically the WoW version of the grand exchange (Not in functionality obviously).
---
I was full set on rolling a dwarf hunter as was my original character but as of a month ago I've decided to be a paladin.  After playing one on a pserver they are just soooooo much more useful to groups in both pvp and pve.
---
The leveling times should be disclaimered to consider the server population.
---
Just had a glance at Teldrassil and The Emerald Dreamcatcher alone could take you hours as the dresser has a considerable respawn time.
---
I would say the best place for meeting up with friends from different starting zones is at Darkshore 11-15. It's the most natural and efficient way for everyone if you can wait until about 11 to see your friends.
---
r/thubreddithconverthathionths
---
No they wont, just make it clear to everyone in the group to need roll for it. So you're not the only one needing, that'll look bad. Of course this does not apply to (almost all) greens and blues. Most blues, unless they are twink items will just go for a little bit over their vendor price on the action house so before you need make sure nobody actually needs the item and everyone agrees to need roll for it. Exceptions for green items will be at lvl 55 and onwards. Some items like "Robe of frost wrath" etc will fetch for a couple hundred on the AH. So make sure you don't accidentialy greed roll for those. Also, remember to be a kind player and if somebody accidentaly greeds or passes on a valuable item don't be a douche and roll it out with the "/roll 1-5" command instead. Unless you don't give af ofc, gold is gold.
---
&gt; till you die
---
I’m kind of here too. But conveniently forgetting that a hybrid in classic couldn’t just push respec...
---
Because carrion bird does less damage
---
The fedex/exploration routes have a big flaw that I never seen get brought up. You can only do one Main City gryphon quest (Nessa Shadowsong, Gryan stoutmantle, Honor Students) and they may in fact be race locked. I can confirm this from the last stress test. 
---
You can still do it but this is over 3k xp that is in all those fedex guides from pserver testing that you'll have to make up for.
---
When?
---
For me WoW was so much more than just a video game when I was younger.
---
I'll never forget the guys I played with, I forgot the name of our guild but our leaders name was bunstert. I met him at ZF around level 45 and went into BC with the guys. 
---
Hopefully I can find them again
---
Weapon skills require level 10 to train. Idk where the sword skill is trained but if its not in Darn you wont be able to get it if you go at level 5.
---
To be clear, the tier armor is almost never best in slot for any class (certain exceptions exist). That being said, we can look at the differences in amount of stats to roughly estimate their power difference. Rogues are a good class to use as a model because their stat priority is simple and the sets don't weigh them down with too many random useless stats. You can get more optimized pre-raid gear, but you can also get more optimized gear at raid tier 1; let's call this apples to apples.
---
The races' base stats vary, so for simplicity, let's say an average 60 Rogue has 80 base strength, 130 base agility, and 75 base stamina.
---
||Str|Agil|Stam|Armor|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Shadowcraft (tier 0)|43|157|87|978|
---
|Nightslayer (tier 1)|50 (16% more)|186 (18% more)|134 (54% more)|1152 (17% more)|
---
|Tier 0 including base stats|123|287|162||
---
|Tier 1 including base stats|130 (5% more)|316 (10% more)|209 (29% more)||
---
Amusingly, the Nightslayer's bad set bonuses lets Shadowcraft catch up in a lot of ways. The +200 armor means it has more armor, and the 40 AP is basically 40 more Strength. Nightslayer does get 5% crit chance, which is a big deal, so let's just say the crit cancels out the set bonuses.
---
The napkin math bears out that a raider will have roughly 15% more damage and 30% more health than a non-raider. So it's a pretty big uphill battle. If you're playing against merely casual PvPers, you can beat them, but you won't beat a serious PvPer if you're at a gear disadvantage.
---
Fury for Blood Craze.
---
The Hammersmith gear is mostly stun-based and most melee dps gravitate towards swords/axes. Armorsmithing is also a great options too. {ick the one that feels right and has blues/epics you're interested in crafting one day.
---
Looks great! Will definitely check this out during stress test.
---
I haven’t seen anything for the America’s so if you can kindly give me a link I’ll be on my way
---
Your Classic experience mirrors the memories I have of leveling 2 Shamans (on difference servers, so no twinking) in retail vanilla. The first one I leveled as Enhance, and the second one I leveled as Resto. I extensively tested different totem and weapon setups while leveling them both, and I always fell back on 2H with Rockbiter (Windfury was too random), even as Resto. I never felt the need to stick with 1H and shield because I never had any downtime with a 2H weapon if I used the correct spell/totem rotations. The only time I stopped using a 2H was when I didn't have access to a good staff on my Resto Shaman or when I was the mob sponge while questing with my Rogue buddy.
---
My experience as a Shaman on a Nostalrius-derived server was much different. It became clear pretty early that I had to go 1H and shield if I wanted to minimize my downtime. I was getting chunked by equal-level mobs without a shield. Does this prove anything? Nah, but everything I'm hearing from people who played Classic beta indicates that mobs (both elite and non-elite) are wimpier in Classic.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
It's a 1 day stress test to max level 15.  After that, your toon is deleted.  Who the fuck cares about a leveling guide?  We'll all be one-shot by Raf when they spawn him in Stormwind.
---
How was sham healing? The class is also on my list and I wouldn’t hate being resto but never experienced it.
---
My almost done set up for classic! (Just need to build a new desk.) New outlet, wood planks put up on the wall, and desk moved into the closet. For the Alliance!
---
I don't have more free time to give at this point especially before classic launch. Use one of the many great horde guides!
---
Red = soulfire from down town.
---
Better players still have ways of differentiating themselves with pure skill and knowledge of their toolkit, believe me. I played arguably the simplest dps spec in the game, havoc - and the amount of little tiny things that 99% of people don't know about or know how to do is crazy. 
---
&gt;1 button I use 85% of the time and have 15/20 other buttons that round it out
---
What are you gonna do, open a portal halfway through the fight? It's more like 1 button 99% of the time, with the other 1% being an occasional blink, iceblock or evocate - in the context of mage which I'm familiar with. You'll use about as many 'extra' buttons as you do in retail on most classes/specs, just without the slightly less braindead whackamole rotations.
---
Did undead mage in vanilla, and it really wasnt my style. I'm going Orc Warrior this time with 15+ years of melee and tanking experience under my belt.
---
The name reservation is 3pm PST. If they release the realm list first thing that morning, that would likely be enough time. I say we will see it this Friday (after launch test is over) or the following Monday (early in the morning)

I do mostly agree but I'm also pretty spineless when they are higher level. Then its /bow and hope they take pity.
---
Thanks, and what is "GLUE"? lvl55
---
Leave the diatribe at the door, please.
---
love seeing funny comments like this
---
Classic.wowhead.com
---
Da fuq is your UI?
---
the privacy curtains got me. that or its a changing room lol
---
this is what i'm talking about. disgusting. never bow. you wait until they are attacking a mob and attack. or you call your higher level friends in.
---
Named mobs have a way faster respawn time in Classic than on any pservers I've played on.
---
Your working really hard to justify something people hate. Your working really hard to make socially acceptable something that people hate.
---
You do realize that prebis is quite inferior to a lot of dungeon gear. Especially for warlocks who don't get spell hit in their talent trees. 
---
Now why don't you actually reference the game's MECHANICS instead of slinging your theory craft BS.
---
Like how MC is easy if you have a brain, and there aren't any bosses to act as DPS checks until BWL.
---
Just to clarify here: you have seen posts for other regions?
---
Friend and I are aiming for level 60 about 7 or 8 days out from launch.
---
Not sure what my friend's daily routine is, I'm doing a water fast for the first three days then switching to one meal a day plus supplements for at least a few weeks after that.
---
Druids are great healers in 5-mans. As long as the tank/dps isn't stupid and gives you time to drink between pulls, you have the hps output to keep a 5-man alive through some heavy shit. Much better than a paladin, comparable to a priest, plus you have tools like faerie fire, bear-bash and feral charge to help lock down troublesome mobs.
---
No res? No problem. No one will die unless the group is deadass awful.
---
I don’t think they put time sinks into the game. They put stuff in that makes the world feel real, which sometimes caused led to activities being time consuming.
---
That's actually such a good analogy haha, love it!
---
Druids in the open world are especially annoying
---
You think the R10 rogue gear is better than T1 for pvp purposes?
---
Let's play the game where you suggest a random combination of two things and I see if I can find a picture of them together regardless of overall efficacy?
---
Both ppp need to be moving if i recall
---
Vanilla is a great base but I personally like Coconut Ice Cream so I am right and you are wrong ;) ;)
---
&gt;substantially easier time using mana shield
---
No.
---
Do hunter traps activate on mounted players?
---
Also does damage de-mount them?
---
wut
---
honestly really good , you just chain healed mostly (intelligently) , dropped supporting totems (Windfury for melee, mana tide etc) and saved the big heals for the tanks when geared you could out heal just about any class bar spikey healing moments from priests or mass druid tranquils, I ended up with a mix of T2/T2.5/T3 gear the real trick that separated a good healing shaman from a bad was positioning and mana conservation regardless of gear though MP5 was an absolute must to start with pre T1 gear
---
Nah you gotta play the decoy and lead him into a trap.
---
Nah I'm all about red is dead when I can dead them. Otherwise it's none or my business.
---
I understand that people hate it, but I don't think that hate is justified. I've yet to really get people to argue what is so wrong with it.
---
&gt;prebis is quite inferior to a lot of dungeon gear.
---
What? Prebis IS dungeon gear. Prebis stands for Pre raid Best In Slot. That means that best possible dungeon gear you can get before getting raid loot. And with the sheet you can calculate how valuable spellhit is for a warlock.
---
What game mechanics are you talking about? I know about hit caps soft caps crit caps and all of them. I'm saying you can make an addon that calculate this and gives out a number on roughly how much dps you will do in ideal situations. That number is how good your gear is. 
---
I'm well aware that MC is easy as hell, I'm not saying this is specifically for MC or any raid at all. I was just giving an example to how looking for players would work with this addon.
---
Pet racial and resistance to stun. Way better than troll
---
The fedex guides I've seen (as well as my own) don't have you doing multiple of those, could you link the one you are talking about? But if the one you want to use does have you doing those quests that you can't do, then it's pretty easy to account for along the way. There are a few quests that you can do that are very easy, and give good rewards to more than make up for it.
---
PS, the guide I have has you getting 12 primarily through exploration. It's really nice. I think most youtube guides only go to 5.
---
Get a little platform for the tower it really shouldn’t be on carpet if possible
---
They will be able to open on you regardless of added “ease” of seeing them in stealth if they want to. 
---
There are idiots yes. 
---
This implies they would need to LOS you after opening, and that they couldn’t just go to the left or right for LOS instead of dropping down. 
---
Etc etc etc etc etc etc etc
---
Druid is fast leveling, but I found it too boring to play after levelling one up.
---
Your pretty fucking blind if you think people aren't justified in their anger. There are hundreds of threads and posts you can search about why people hate the garbage your hocking. Your not trying to understand anyone.  Go back to your echo chamber in retail. I'm tired of arguing with you.
---
Madseason and Platinum have become my favorites and it's really not even close.
---
Hi folks,
---
Who I am: I'm a mid-20s 13-year WoW veteran. I work a full time job and am married. I live in California.
---
What I'm looking for: An active mediumcore or hardcore raid guild with a friendly but serious atmosphere. My #1 goal is to have fun, so I'm not interested in dying for 10 times on farm content OR raiding for 40 hours in a week (Which I actually have done before). I'd also like a guild that will be actively participating in BGs and wPVP.
---
My raiding experience: Played in Vanilla but never hit 60 before TBC. Raided as far as Illidari Council in TBC. In WotLK, I was in a hardcore guild that got pretty much every single server first in Ulduar, and I think I was even in a top-10 US kill for normal Freya. In Cata and MoP I raided very casually and just cleared content on normal. In WoD I raided casually for the first few raids but joined a hardcore group progressing through mythic HFC and was regularly topping DPS charts. We got as far as Mythic Xhul before the Legion pre-patch and were working on Mythic Mannoroth before Legion. I haven't raided seriously during Legion or BFA. 
---
Also, it may not mean much but I did do all of the vanilla raids in TBC, including several full 40-man Naxx clears. They weren't necessarily DIFFICULT at level 70 but you still had to follow most of the mechanics.
---
My PvP experience: I hit 1800+ in arenas in 2s, 3s and 5s in arenas during TBC and WotLK, and haven't done much arena since, and I've never really dabbled in RBGs. I used to LOVE playing in random BGs with my friends, and would absolutely be interested in BGs and wPVP in Classic.
---
Class: I'm about 80% on playing hunter, 10% on playing druid, and about 10% for everything else. I've mained hunter for most of retail, and have hit level cap on pretty much everything else. On BFA I've mained DH. I'd be open to playing another role if it meant the right group.
---
Faction: Slight lean toward Alliance, but finding the right group is more important to me.
---
My release plan: I'm taking 1 week off of work for Classic, and intend to be level 60 within 4-5 weeks. I've been watching a lot of Classic content to prepare for the level grind, including a lot of leveling videos.
---
My raid availability: I prefer weekends. I can do Friday evenings, almost any time on Saturday and Sunday, and can do ONE weeknight, as long as it starts no earlier than 6PM PST. Minor preference toward Thursdays.
---
Server Type: Slight lean toward PvP, but no strong preference.
---
Thanks to anyone who read this big wall of text.
---
And somehow female night elf hunters are still the worst by a large margin...
---
Nice troll, 4 stars
---
PvP servers really aren't bad. You will get ganked on occasion, but it's usually as simple as just going somewhere else (just a different part of the zone you're in.)
---
Is shaman dps considered ok for dungeons?
---
Yeah all the people speeding to 60 are the same that are pushing for a week 2 Rag. The amount that actually pull that off is going to pretty low I think so most 14 RL day level 60s will spend the next 2-3 weeks getting pre-raid BiS and progressing MC, not ganking lowbies.
---
Again with this toxic behaviour and no explanation.
---
And I don't play retail, I've been playing vanilla pservers for the past 4 years.
---
Not willing to give out this info. Nice try though
---
What I really miss is the map/route in the guide. Still not having a optimal running route really sucks. Joana always shows the route and even in my small guides i show the exact route you should take. Not to mention that the guide is entirely based on other peoples Content.
---
Oh nice. My Paladin will have to check when in Southshore...
---
Dont be bad, use distract
---
For sure. If you want minimum attention farming, Hunter is the best option.
---
Is this like the best ui addon? What makes it so popular?
---
No, no new exciting content updates ever come to runescape when it’s polled because it’s nearly impossible to get 75% of people to agree on something.
---
You sound like a antivaccer
---
If you call a giant dragon "climate change", then yes.
---
When I played, a “ninja” would be if someone rolled on something they couldn’t used and sold it. People didn’t like ninjas because it was a shitty thing to do.  Now instead, you’ve normalized the behavior by having everyone do it, so if everyone is a ninja then nobody is, and you support it with the mental gymnastics of equating a tangible thing in front of you (the item) with its theoretical worth instead.
---
It comes down to player experience. If something bis drops in a group and they need it, i.e axe of the deep woods in this case, I’m either going to let them have it, or if the whole group rolls need I will and then give it to them.  Because that’s an awesome thing to have happen for somebody, and they’re going to remember it.  When I got my forors book in vanilla my group didn’t have to let me have it, but they did and getting my quel was one of my best memories from vanilla.  Around here it’s like people think you don’t deserve anything you aren’t farming the gold for.
---
Red = dead
---
Well your friends have grown up and have recognized the superior faction, no sense in staying in neverland forever. 
---
(JK, I’m rolling alliance this time myself).
---
Why run 5 laps around azeroth for the water totem once when you can do it 20 times
---
Lol I’m not playing paladin again
---
I mean.. it will happen on August 13th no? and character creation will be open until release
---
It's 2019 man, I think you should come out of the closet... no one is gonna judge you.
---
Nah it really depends and always has. Starting zone mobs where always easy as fuck. You could pull a bunch and be alright. (Except that gnome yeti cave thing that used to always fuck me up) Some zones had mobs that were a bit tougher depending on the zone / mob type. You should be able to really be able to do whatever you want though as long as you’re intelligently pulling.
---
No offense, but it’s kinda cringe asking people what to eat during a video game binge lol
---
Where are you hovering over for coordinates? That's news to me.
---
It's very very simple. BOE's can be sold and exchanged for gold to buy other things.  Basic economic principles allow for you to look at any BOE as simply a pile of gold of roughly equivalent value to the BOE.
---
So what's better?
---
1. Using a system that is VERY susceptible to misuse but people will sometimes directly get an item upgrade without having to exchange it.
---
2. A system that literally cannot be abused in any way and has much less variance in terms of random upgrades but requires 1 extra step of exchanging.
---
Nobody on this forum has "normalized ninjaing". If you've played on private servers at all it becomes immediatly obvious that needing on BOE's simplifies everything and is the most fair for everyone.
---
if you mouse over the npc's names it lists their coordinates :)
---
No lol - it's not an addon to retail.
---
Would assume so
---
Lol pick it up whenever you want... you'll have it at endgame irregardless.
---
"But honey i'm raiding"
---
*closes the curtains with a flourish*
---
Man I remember going into the tauran mill in and hiding in the fireplace on my gnome rogue
---
I can't wait for the game to come out so we can stop reading the same 6 threads over and over.
---
Do you think people value hunters in 5 mans? I love the idea of playing hunter but I'm worried that an over abundance of hunters along with it being a DPS role will make it hard to find 5 man groups. I assumed people would always take a mage and maybe other classes over hunter, but maybe that's wrong.
---
&gt;The announcement of server names is being held onto as a pre-launch hype mechanism.
---
Lol, funny that people haven't figured that out yet... they could have announced server names 3 weeks ago.
---
Alright, thanks
---

Curse will most likely be able to help us with keep addons up to date. and also be the main site for addons
---
Ultimately I am going to do AS MANY QUESTS AS POSSIBLE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER while also enjoying the finer things like fishing and tradeskillz other than Engineering. I spent way too much time auto-accepting quests without reading the story or getting immersed.
---
I want to take my time and enjoy the lore and quest text, but also know I'm not wasting precious time with less than efficient quest routing. 
---
Is Questie a part of my vision? Maybe? For me I will try to strike a balance.
---
Links or it didn't happen.
---
What this dude is probably trying to say is that druids dont have alot of burst damage, so they take longer to kill their target and require more patience and utility. My dude here is probably used to playing a rogue or hunter and equates being good in pvp with landing 4k crits and nuking a target as fast as possible. Even a cat can shred a cloth user in a few lucky hits, its a good feeling, dont get me wrong, but its not what you are going to be doing most of the time.
---
But why are you telling me this though?
---
I leave work August 26th at 6am and don’t return until September 8th at 6pm.  Were getting lvl 40 or bust.
---
Naw, you seem like a tool so I'll level the good way and you do you.  Bye!  
---
Imagine having the internet at your fingers and being intentionally obtuse...
---
Hunter is probably top farmer because of their simple rotation and little down time.
---
If they go BM, your pet becomes a fantastic tank and can hold aggro well.
---
I have experience as a druid and have found them to be fantastic as well, but I'm willing to bet they are behind warlock and hunter for kill speed. The benefit for druid is just that they also have no downtime.
---
Nothing. We want to earn it. We want our characters to reflect our effort, notnout wallets.
---
For someone who doesn't plan on raiding due to IRL commitments. Which tank would be better for me?
---
Warrior or Druid?
---
I ask because the general consensus on this sub seems to be that a fresh 60 Druid scales better than a fresh 60 Warrior and that once warriors start getting raid gear they outshine the Druid. 
---
Since I can't raid and will only be doing 5 mans I'm wondering if druid would be better for my needs. Though I prefer the sword and board class fantasy to the druid one.
---
O you are talking about the tooltips with all the info. I gotcha. Those are generated on demand when you hover and would be quite expensive to do for every object in game. I do have coordinates listed in the guide manually where I think they are necessary but wouldn't want to manually list them for every object especially when they are available in the tooltip. I have a discord with a suggestions channel. If the absence of a coordinate causes you trouble on particular steps I'd be happy to add them.
---
All of this!
---
I think he's saying don't play the game how he doesn't like.
---
Thank you for noticing! I couldn’t resist, it had to be done.
---
Yeah I'll world PvP when I'm doing something else, like leveling or whatever. But when I get to max level, I don't wanna just roam around looking for someone to kill for no reward. It's something I enjoyed as a kid, but feels like a waste of time today.
---
I'd rather have them implement Arena or something; a place where you can play against good players. No-Changers &amp; players who aren't good enough can stick to World PvP. Win-win.
---
Thank you!
---
I recalled with this for a while. I decided to try something new just to make classic feel even more fresh. I will definitely level an alt of my original choice at some point.
---
I really like the tick boxes very nice.
---
I think pvp Q times won’t be too bad assuming they start with cross realm BGs which they seem to be doing
---
Thank you. Haven't been on in 5yrs
---
Enjoy!
---
Looks great, and highly customizable, I have no idea if it's the best, but I love it and I know it's very popular.
---
I did Vanilla Questing.me for Alliance and i wouldn't recommend it for launch because you'll be hitting westfall around level 16 and you'll be in hell, better find an ally guide who would get you at westfall asap or skip it
---
Feel free to explain your point beyond "you're wrong"

Still gonna help, utility is always nice to have. It essentially gives you’re class a few new abilities

Don’t you all have phones?
---
Shaman is my favorite class. Unfortunately I can't main one in classic due to them being exclusive to the inferior faction.
---
Holy shit you are one hell of a prick aren't you?
---
If it was this easy you wouldn't make 5 posts about how i can just "google it".
---
I loved my orc war but things fell apart Horde-side and I ended up playing a human. Loved hanging out on my PvP-server orc war until I just decided it was a distraction from grinding all that +Def gear.
---
So... me that kind of orc? We’ll see.
---
Big fat agree. This 1000%
---
Just get ItemRack (or equiv) and equip the relevant one.
---
I personally like those the dragonling and the fear immunity one. To answer the post at the same time.
---
I would definitely say druid is better but honestly if you are just gonna do dungeons pick what you like to play. Watch some gameplay of the two because they are fairly different in terms of gameplay.
---
I don’t need to explain why Druid is objectively the worst pvp class in Vanilla by far. This is common knowledge among Vanilla players. It would be a waste of time anyway since your sole argument would be “muh vlag karrier herp”
---

TIL everyone peaks at 60.

Off the first 12days of launch. Have to officiate the marriage of my step-daughter then the day after its WoW classic for me.
---
If you hate fights interrupting your leveling, don't PVP.
---
If you like fights more than you like leveling, PVP.
---
BGs won't be in until phases 3 and 4.
---
Oh,and for your edit: the second harm condition checks if you have an enemy targeted. The first condition only checks if you have a mouseover and will not trigger if you only have a target selected. Technically you can get away with empty brackets, which is the always true condition, and so will try to cast Intimidating Shout even if you don't have a target. This will give you an error if your target is not an enemy, where the [harm] condition won't even attempt to cast if you don't target an enemy.
---
How expensive/difficult is it to get the three reflector trinkets once your high enough character and engineering level?
---
In my opinion it slows you down VERY little in the long run and it creates so many memories and good experiences that I'll always go on the pvp server, even if I'm not much of a pvper myself.
---
Thanks
---
Giving up bags of shards for bags of food and ammunition... two of those three cost $
---
Or begin your travels.
---
This is why I use the mouse to move, one click and I'm back facing where I was :^)
---
That is what is drawing me in. The ooga gang type shit lol
---
I feel like all the new animations are too bouncy. I dont mind the character models themselves as much but the bouncy running animations kill me.
---
10% of the time they will just open with chain sap.
---
It's because of Windows 10. It's not a Blizzard issue it's Microsoft's fault.
---
We will have server list before august 13.
---
It's fun, I plan on going PvE since I just want to get my characters raid ready within the first couple or months and don't want to be bothered - that's what's great about BGs :)
---
I'd rather not fuel your laziness. There's been like a total of 10-15 classic posts in the last month. Go find it.
---
No...because that would cause confusion.
---
New names.
---
If you go pvp the best time to level is right away or in a late phase. The period after honor but before BGs is a nightmare.
---
Or he has a brain... you don't need 7 months to coordinate with your friends or guild.
---
Wednesday or Friday post test they will announce.
---
'The opponents think you are hacking'. ... ? Enhancement sucks since the WF nerf. No counterargument possible. And if WF doesn't proc enough or fast enough, then there's really nothing left for an Enhance. As Enhance, you haven't got the mobility nor damage mitigation/avoidance (plate, bubbles, magic removal, CC) of a Retri Paladin, and you haven't got the damage of an Arms Warrior. Actually you'd be a Fury Warrior, but with a bit of healing and way less damage output.
---
Enhancement is a dead spec in both PvP (single and BG) and PvE, and no well montaged PvP vid is going to change that fact.
---
If you want to deal damage in PvP, then Elemental is the only way. Actually I'd argue that for PvP, Elemental is even better than Restoration, as the only significant thing you'd give up then is 10% healing power, but you'd offer so much more burst damage to your group when concerning BGs, and thus offer more utility (don't forget that regardless of spec, at the end of the day Shamans are built to provide utility).
---
It will slow you down.
---
Sometimes you wont be able to lvl unless you switch zones, go a few times into a dungeon or group up and fight back.
---
Sometimes it wont affect you and enemies will stay neutral.
---
Yet i heavily recommend pvp.
---
After some time you will realize that wpvp is a main content of wow.
---
You can spend hours hunting them in stv.
---
If not whole days and you wont regret a thing.
---
And alot of gear will be even more important for lvling since it will give you that additional damage that can change a loss into a win.
---
Dont even get me started about the feeling when you finally manage to kill lvl 60s.
---
If you want to be an enhancement shaman (and get a spot in raid), you must go orc and get the nightfall axe. A nightfall shaman is the only way you will get in any decent raiding guild unless you want to heal. I'm unsure about elemental dps.
---
As a repeat thread for the 100th time no!

Thanks, you're correct, added in 1.13.10

Pretend there are people viewing this thread who dont have your library of "vanilla common knowledge" in their head, try and explain it for those people still on the fence about what class to pick, because that is basically what this thread is about and you are not really adding anything to the conversation at all.
---
Is there any chance of adding class quests to this? Otherwise this is really well done.

Yeah this is absolutely a real thing, they are enemy #1 of Stormwind

Been telling people priests are going to be way over populated. (Because they are the best don't cha know.) Looks like so far i was right. 14.4% atm. 6% paladins and 8% shamans. That is ~7.2% per side.  Allaince its okay but on horde well you want double, or more, the resto shamans than priests. 
---
I may just roll shaman QQ (i hate shaman leveling.)

That’s not true. Mana regeneration isn’t a percentage of your total pool. If you had two characters whose only difference was 2000 mana on one bad 20000 mana, the amount of mana you regen per tick would be the exact same.
---
people, including some big streamers and players, also thought leeway wasn't working as intended and other things
---
this can be re tested in the stress test, just test it there
---
Great. Now go fuck yourself.
---
Hmmm well that is a change.
---
Thanks for the reply, that sounds great. I really feel like I've def missed something not playing on a PVP, since I literally would flag and fight at TM/SS for hours and love it
---
I feel like I gave OP very solid advice. Do NOT roll a Druid for pvp if you don’t have an affinity for the class because you’ll end up regretting it deeply. I’ve seen it happen time and again over the years.
---
Thought about my old Tauren Druid, but I don’t want to work that hard this time around. So I’ll probably roll a mage or rogue just for fun.
---
I hear you there too, both has it's ups and downs
---
Didn't happen I guess.
---
What class quests would you like? Most should be at least listed for you to be able to investigate. Many have in step by step guide.
---
It's about lucky proc rates. Like going on a crit streek.  Except you can go on a windfury crit streek.  When it happens, you win.  It just doesn't happen that much.  Its not a spec I would use beyond leveling, but even then enh shaman reckhouse in world pvp and WSG.
---
I don't much care for going out of my way to attack people. I'll fight over resources, scarce mobs, and quest items, I'll attack people who are ganking or have ganked other people recently, and I'll mess around in PvP hotpoints like Nessing, SM, etc. but everyone else I leave pretty much alone.  I've got shit to do and I don't get much satisfaction out of attacking a dude who is half dead, oom, or killing mobs.
---
OK. Guess I'll go ahead and mute the troll for my future peace of mind.
---
Damn.  Cant wait for spellstones coming back though! WOOT!!!!
---
Imo the only two you need to watch out for are asmonbald and sodapoppin. The thing with Soda however, is that he rolled on a TBC private server that came out many months ago and never really gained a following there. It's not the best example since you cannot stream private servers, but I think it speaks loudly enough that even the legion of fanboys these streamers have simply wont commit to the game when all is said and done.
---
Thanks for that unput
---
You do you.
---
That's what she said
---
And how many hundreds of threads you saw about leeway. How many videos of people testing it and bitchin about it.
---
If something that big was happening, we would know.
---
I'm very confused by your comment and would appreciate some elaboration, LFD like Looking for dungeon? The current tool we have in game that vanilla advocates specifically dont want to force community? What makes you think that would pass? and I thought the grand exchange is similar to the auction house, how is LFD the equivalent?
---
I’m rerolling my original orc warlock from vanilla but as an undead. I’m head cannoning that he died and was raised as forsaken.
---
hunters just solo dmt for 150 gold per hour and the fastest class to level.
---
Engineering is what you would usually pick as a hunter, yes.
---
you saw a shit ton, and people were apparently wrong, which kinda shows the point imo
---
I'm not saying he's right, just that it's something that can be easily confirmed and he said he's willing to do it
---
I played on pvp servers in vanilla and TBC, and it was a lot of fun really, except for the very first server I played on that was horribly imbalanced and I was on the end with a lot fewer people. I'd say do it. 
---
Of course now I'm an older person with less time to devote, so I am going pve, and I think it'll be a nice change. I will do a lot of bg's for sure.
---
That made me laugh to hard kek
---
It's war. It's not meant to be fun.
---
This is actually the first comment you made containing any sort of advice. Instead of saying druid is bad at pvp you could instead lead with the argument that people have regretted rolling druid because it did not live up to their expectations. Maybe you also want to add why people have regretted rolling druid in pvp?
---
That is the best thing whit "fresh" there are no high levels around. So most of the pvp will be eaven.
---
Yeah it looks like the consensus is that it is hella fun, thanks for the input. You'll def have a good time in PVE, it's still fun :P
---
Dwarf Pally, huge pp,  15 years apart.
---
But the shadow reflector is BoE so you can buy them on the AH right? No need to bother getting the recipe unless you wanna make and sell them.
---
Nice video dude
---
Yeah pretty sure all pet attack speeds have been normalized for 1.12
---
Nope. Was a Druid, now I’m going Paladin.
---
Thank you very much, I'm glad you liked it!
---
I've *only* played a melee class on retail (Paladin in vanilla, Rogue in WotLK/Cata/MoP, Warrior in MoP).  I'll actually be playing a range class (Mage) for the first time on classic
---
You'll be able to install them directly from Twitch. Just hit the install button, then later go back and check for updates. (They might have some kind of automated update, but I am not sure about it.)
---
Engineering, especially for a hunter, is advantageous.  Even if it's just for PvE.  As a side note, engineering is generally a money sink (costs more to level / maintain than it generates). As such, I've made a guide for how to level 1-150 while earning gold rather than wasting it: [low level engineering gold guide](https://wow.classicraids.com/guides/professions/how-make-gold-low-level-engineering)
---
Rogue / Hunter / Druid are the best IMO because there's so little downtime.  Warlock / Mage are doable but you still need to drink or heal up
---
I'll fed ex until lvl 5.  Then grind on uncontested mobs until 8.  Group up with my slut of a wife at that point.
---
This is some AWESOME work. 
---
Anyone able to put it into an add on form for in-game use? I feel like thats the only thing missing from making this guide perfect.
---
I don't know how likely people are to try and sell them for profit, I barely saw them back in Classic, but times have changed. Hopefully someone will be selling and we can be lazy bums and just burn money to get our reflectors.
---
Servers havent been announced yet
---
If you want to throw half of the experience out the window, pick PVE. 
---
If you want an authentic Vanilla experience, pick PVP.
---
Was a Paladin...but I really want to go Troll Shaman this time around. I got one to 20 on a Pserver but I really didnt like the way they healed, granted I didnt even have chain heal at 20, so idk if it was an accurate assessment of the class. I want to heal..just contemplating between Troll Priest or Troll Shaman. Shaman to 20 was a hell more fun than Priest though
---
So I'm planning to level as Mining/Skinning and switch to Engineering at 60.  What do you guys think I should pick up for my second profession?
---
I've pretty much always done Enchanting on all my characters on retail but I don't think I can go back to a world without Vellums.  Is Enchanting still worth it for DEing?
---
would take longer, the distance from entrance of durotar (coming from barrens) to valley of trials is a bit shorter than the distance to the zeppelin, and also you'd have to wait for the zeppelin and then get off and walk a little bit to get to deathknell
---
Thanks, a lot of good here speaking of PVP realms. None bad so far
---
Gotta cook some food ahead of time on Sunday night (Albondiga soup, extra spicy.) Monday, sleep as much as possible before it goes live. I want to wake up an hour or two beforehand, have some food, then get ready to ~~quest~~ struggle finding mobs to kill. Next it'll be keeping my eye on chat for a guild to join, and hoping that I can keep up with the leveling.
---
Blizzard has stated that we will have the realm list prior to the name reservation day (Aug 13). So we'll have plenty of time to decide which realm to play on :)
---
I too recommend skinning / mining to start.  You will need ore/bars, stones, gems, and leather to level up engineering. Skin and mine everything you can, stockpile mats as you level and at 60 (or close enough to 60) replace skinning with engineering.
---
i think the common skip now is to swim along the coast (when you get off the boat at theramore) until you get to the spot where it says Dun Morogh, then you drown yourself and get spirit rezzed in Dun Morogh. It's technically faster than any other route, but the downside is you get less exploration xp and you don't get the thelsamar fp, so i guess each has its merits
---
Planning on reroll druid, but I'm not sure If I'm going to make it NE like I played before or Tauren for something new.
---
So I jumped the gun a bit and assumed since [this quest] (https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2242/destiny-calls) in Teldrassil wasn't there, there weren't any other Rogue quests.
---
Not sure if you consider it all that important to list, now that I think about it, since Daggers aren't the best option for leveling.
---
I'm the opposite lol. Had no interest in playing a paly back in the day, now I'm considering it.
---

Yep
---
Please keep that trash out of classic. It’s unnecessary and just creates negativity. There’s no need for it.
---
Chuck Norris saying "see you in the Barrens" would work miracles.
---
Somebody should make a guide skipping most quests the popular speed guides take. Might even be faster if you´re in the middle of the zerg.
---
Doubling joannas record? lol there were people doing rfc and leveling faster than joana's best time on the beta. And joana had better leveling times on the beta than the original 4days20hrs playthrough
---
Oh my god thank you, I've been looking around for ages for an add-on that does this and let ignoring the "questie" answers thinking that people were not understanding the question, because I'd only used it on pservers.

The Loremaster in me rejoices.

Can you read?

&gt; My friends and I forming a guild to play the game together at a slow pace.
---
I've never messed with changing my UI before is this hard to do?
---
I really dont wana play a female night elf..... But how else am i supposed to play warrior?
---
No! You will enter your character's name into a blizzard database and they will use a revolving round robin lottery with a few rng elements of surprise and a goblin rocket boot on a bunny rabbit out of a top hat to place your new character on a random realm list number tag 1 - 9000 with no server name. Blizzard already officially announced this.

I have been my guilds MT warrior for like 4 years now on Pservers
---
Stop horsing around
---
It can be an extra dot.
---
If it's a duel where you have the advantage already, it's pretty funny.
---
Some salty melee "your dragon won the duel now you" QQers out there.
---
Definately one of the less serious picks.
---
-20% rage cost on your primary damage ability for 36 levels is way better than 3% extra parry.
---
Doing horde for the first time. Doing Druid for the first time. Going to guild and raid again since BC. Going to be fun!!
---
Everything in the game can be de’d by a level 5 1/300 enchanter, make an alt for deing
---
Thex for your input
---
Same here, im going from Alliance Rogue to Horde Priest, the only thing im doing the same is rolling a Pvp server.
---
I’ve literally never played a private server and I’m playing classic and same with most of my friends not really sure what your point is
---
The problem with leveling as prot is you have barely any increase in damage, so you survive a long time but you will need it because it takes you so long to kill mobs. This of course won't be an issue if he is leveling as a group but if they split at any time or he can't make a session might find they begin to pull further and further ahead.
---
Has blizzard mentioned if they will/wont integrate transmogging gear?
---
I will definitely roll Orc Warlock again as my main. But will probably level a Orc Warrior as well.
---
Let them die.
---
On the 13th, everyone that is subscribed, will be able to reserve up to three character names.  
---
Everyone might as well subscribe now and participate in the stress test if they want to reserve their names.
---
Its true that most druid 1v1 fights end up with who could outlast eachother and fights tend to take more time than your average dps class. But there are some ways to play druid in pvp and  avoid this to some degree, one involving catburst and gnomish death ray, very luck dependant, and another involving a balance specc and some AQ gear. Im sure we will see alot of skilled druid pvp in the years to come amd hopefully new metas will come to light.
---
I usually let the Healer know I'll leave it up to them if DPS needs to be spanked. Some healers either enjoy healing through stupid, they groan and keep their mouth shut and heal through stupid, or it pisses them off. Make it clear that anyone who pisses off the Healer goes.
---
Do add-ons on Mac work the same as on PC in that you simply put the file in the interface folder?
---
I've tried a few add-ons on private servers and have had issues, but I could just be dumb.
---
If you are turning the camera or your character, mouseover won't "work" because the mouse pointer will be hidden.
---
Mouseover macros are great and it adds to the skillcap, stop making it seem like it's the opposite.
---
I have said that too but have had a lot of people say they aren't even subbing for name reservations they are going August 27th onwards only.
---
and if you got the time you farm that naga trinket that is a activateable 4 second stun
---
100% do it and let me know what server you are on - I'm trying to learn Portuguese :)
---
I like this technique, but you can make them longer if you use like, the first letter of each word like if you wanted "the ogre has 1 eye and a nose" you could do TOh1eaan, and spice it up with numbers or / and symbols, T0h1e@an\* 
---
i think thats pretty hard to crack right?
---
Wednesday, Friday or day of :)
---
&gt; If you want an authentic Vanilla experience, pick PVP.
---
A lot of people's "authentic Vanilla experience" was on a PVE server.
---
Im in Costa Rica and I am pinging 120 to Chicago, so I think you are good with an Eastern US or a Central US server.  You probably dont need ExitLag.
---
Yep. I still play me original Tauren Druid. And I made a Eleven copy of her to play with friends I can't see me playing anything else as a main
---
not having SS for 5 levels is pretty huge.. if you dont get SS at 30 you are doing it wrong
---
A talent that requires a crit to provide bonus armor?  How about Devotion Aura?
---
It will provide memories, that's for sure.
---
&gt;Loving it! Will defo play classic then lol
---
Imagine having your decision based entirely on the availability of a UI. I mean, I don't like playing with normal bars, but still...
---
The best source would be for you to play the stress test in a few days - with a mage, remove arcane intellect and all non-spirit/mp5 INT gear to compare how much mana you regen per tick compared with them on.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Spirit  is a good source from 2006 on regen rates for spirit from the different classes.  Total mana isn't part of the formulas at all.
---
spriest, you can heal in dungeons with shadow as long as your tank isn't underleveled and not terribly undergeared.  no one will wanna tangle with you in pvp because you just won't die unless you get dog piled or heavily outgeared.
---
druids suffer from the problem of a jack of all trades, every other class does their job better and often times this means you'll be fighting those classes in pvp because you have similar win conditions so you'll end up in similar positions.  this doesn't mean you can't win, it just means you really have to pick your fights.  that is in stark contrast to an spriest who is like a herald of cthulu melting faces left and right giving zero fucks about anyone's class.
---
Will you make one FOR THE HORDE!?
---
because your knowledge of how warriors should level is completely outdated
---
using heroic strike like... ever is a huge waste of anything  
---
almost every other skill is more beneficial to warriors over heroic strike&gt;  
---
THE ONLY time you should use heroic strike past lvl 10 is if you are getting rage capped (unlikely)
---
I'm rolling the exact same as I did in 2004. Race, class, name, he will even look the same.
---
I'm going to do everything I did when I was 15, but with a brain this time round.
---
For every person like you who doesn't want BGs, there's a person that does.
---
Why even bother talking to the snowflakes? Let them play bfa
---
Lmao
---
No it doesnt count as having a mana bar I know this because your mana cant be drained while in cat or bear form with mana burn or viper sting
---
You didn't list any concerns.
---
Having everyone need does prevent the last guy from hitting need and taking the item.  You are correct.  I wasn't arguing against that.  I would advocate for everyone to hit need, and then give the item to the appropriate person who will equip it if they didn't already win.  So they might be lying and take it sell themselves anyway?  It takes all of 2 seconds to figure out, and it's a great way for someone to ruin their own reputation on a server.
---
The whole argument is that its shitty to take something that drops that someone will use immediately to sell.  When it happens to you, I hope that you're just as understanding as you expect everyone else should be.
---
I'd put money in there being less than 10 in NA, barely 20 overall. 9 NA, 6 EU, 2 RU, 4 OCE, not sure how the distributions will look. Hoping for at least 2 more for Latin America but doubt it. Guess we'll know on either Wednesday or Friday for sure

Oh my god this is my new favorite post in the history of ever.
---
you guys NEED SS at lvl 30  
---
every 30 seconds you get 5 extra swings.. 5 SWINGS!!  
---
sound small? sure as shit isnt. lets say you have a 3.00 weapon speed. that is 10 autos every 30 seconds.. SS brings your autos up to 15.. thats 50% more swings... that translates to a crap ton more dps than 5% crit.
---
Good riddance...
---
Yeah man you should probably lay low for a while. You stabbed him with a trident.

I (unfortunately) played on a PvP server back in the day. This did not happen. It would just be an hours long back and forth gank-fest, and both sides would come out with significantly less gold.

You sound like you haven't played on a pvp server. You don't "assert dominance" and then they instantly go away. You might be able to get them to give up eventually, but its going to take a while.

Pulling as a warrior is tough if there are multiple mobs and you don't have enough CC to account for all of them.  The rest of your group literally can't do anything while the mobs are traveling too you as they might get aggro.  I always felt pulling with CC is better overall but, I think the only advice I would offer is to save your taunt until you actually really need it to pull a mob away from an unsuspecting clothy.
---
Yes
---
I'm a college student planning to play Classic WoW
---
They all have their perks.
---
SL is the best in most matches. When they can dispel the pet, re-applying it can be annoying.
---
I prefer SM/Ruin. For most of classic you will be able to raid and PvP as the same spec that way.  For the most part.
---
PvP only - SL
---
PvE and PvP - SM/Ruin
---
Functional as both but more PvE (in my experience) DS/Ruin
---
My first character was a NE hunter. I ended up only leveling to 20 or so before I started rerolling over and over again. My highest level character in Vanilla was a 41 Mage. I ended up quitting the game before having a max level character. I did eventually come back at the tail end of TBC and leveled a Hunter to 70 and actually got pretty far in the raids before WotLK came out. Wasn't much of a fan of how easy stuff was getting in WotLK, so I quit again. I haven't played retail since then. I'll be going back to my roots as a NE Hunter yet again, but it will certainly still be new since I never did hit endgame in Vanilla.
---
Negative happened in 2.0
---
As a healer, I generally put that dps on lowest priority. I will top them up if there is 0 other priority in the rest of the group, which in 5 mans means that dps is usually ok. But sometimes they die, especially in messy situations. Everything is situational of course, but often the net DPS loss from them dying isn't enough to offset the cost of keeping them healed
---
Druid tanks are very legit, look up Skarm

---
Dawg. Dont listen to anyone here. They have zero vanilla experience. Hunters are among top DPS in Molten Core and Black Wing Lair. Dont believe me - watch Method or Nihilium raid kills. Hunter dps falls behind in AQ and Naxx. But is still comparable to warlock DPS and far out shines hybrid dps.

I finally got sick of it and called them out for it, and immediately got 6 of my posts flagged, deleted, and account banned.

Its the fact that some mod posts troll comments on an alt and then deletes replies they dont like that pisses me off and say fuck you to blizz.

Hunters rarely, if ever, top damage in raids but they always have a place in raids. Yeah, Rogues and Mages are putting their points in on the damage meters, but that isn't what's going to down the boss.

Google search would of done the job but you are a paid blizzard shill XD. Blizzard have been getting better with their launches and its clear they are trying but BFA had quite a few issues on launch, Stormrage was legit unplayable for 2 days off memory. Legion IS the smoothest blizzard launch to date though. Getting real sick of people acting like BFA was a flawless launch though.

Currently what is happening with regular Spell with Cast Time is that my character wouldn't stop Auto Running at all and just give me error messages.
---
I second what this guy said. It just isn't fun when the only threat is a computer.

I literally replied to your comment above with the links but reading comprehension is clearly hard for you :). I can pull up a lot more if you want though.
---
 Not reading all that but yes, if it does it’s job right, and let’s hope it does!

If you’re talking general PvP, I’d still go with priest. They have an incredibly diverse and powerful toolbox. Mana burn, mind control, the aforementioned offensive dispel, I could rant for hours about how good priests are. I’d go Paladin to duo with a warrior, but for basically everything else I’d argue priest is superior.
---
Rip
---
Frontload as much as possible early on.
---
- Immolate -&gt; speedily throw out X curse (most times agony + the talent that buffs it). 
---
- Dot City (if you don't need a coil+coe to make distance/reset)
---
- Searing Pain most the time after, bigger just shadow bolt.. or bake a pie if you want them to die. 
---
- Shadowburn for a final hit or if they are running and you want to leave them hopeless.
---
If they can dispel, throw what they can't. 
---
Mobility disabling is great for FCs and melee. It's trick around a FaP. Warrior's can't charge you if you are too far but due to Grim Reach(?) you can easilly get them.
---
Being a good lock is a lot of things..
---
- Micromanaging
---
- Knowing when not to DoT for a coil+bandage into a fear+pie.
---
- Fake casting.
---
- Assesing when you are in favour being agressive or not.
---
Stuff and things.
---
Rogues are incredibly fun. Once you’ve tasted the forbidden fruit of stealth, you can’t ever go back. Make sure to level your first aid!
---
I had played retail for several years before I tried vanilla. From the last patch of mop to the beginning of legion. I leveled many many characters during that time. And I always thought of leveling as an obstacle, and disliked every minute of it. But when I tried vanilla, it took me something like 3 hours to hit level 10, and it felt more rewarding than hitting max level in retail, or killing any progression boss. The fact that leveling 1-10 in vanilla was more fun than anything I've ever done in retail(except maybe beating the guardian druid mage tower, that was great) made me realise what all of the desire for classic servers comes from. Vanilla is a grind but it's a fun and rewarding one. 
---
Also the funny wheezing sound that gnolls make.
---
druids tank and heal dungeons fine with 0/30/21
---
It's nice, but imo the map texture doesn't fit
---
Kinda

In a vacuum yes, but with air no. Did you miss _applied_ mathematics?

---
If you're still taking the same amount of adderall during classic launch as you were when you wrote this post, then yes most likely
---
Formal Dangui vendor in Moonglade comes to mind.
---
There is also a Darkmoon Faire vendor that sells limited frog pets
---
Yeah I don't think it would kill me to try it out, seems fun.
---
4 cha.... reddit is not your personal army.
---
Then you are a complete moron and an obvious shill like others have said.
---
I do like the rival point you made it sounds awesome. Kinda like that 1 rouge that just camped a cutoff for months waay back when. Legend
---
NElf hunter was the king of overplayed race/class in vanilla. Kinda feel like nelf is edgy in classic with how much server pop is concentrated on Horde side
---
I've played my original vanilla class for 13 years. Gonna go with something else this time.
---
Yeah its not.
---
You should look up what it is before saying that.
---
I'm sure this will be me on launch day also.  I've been trying to convince myself to play a tank or healer but when the time comes I'm sure it will be another hunter lol
---
It quite possible they don't release the server names until character creation unlocks. This idea that you need to mass coordinate your guild to get your name within 5 seconds of the servers being live (and 2 weeks before you can even play) is stupid.  
---
  
---
At a more practical level they probably will be waiting for the final stress test to get more metrics for server numbers before confirming any server names.
---
The human starting area was the first created of the starting areas so technically it is the longest. However we do not know how much man hours went into each individual starting area.
---
Fun fact. Westfall was actually the first zone that was worked on.
---
No. As far as I know the only CC that dismounts is polymorph. If you can't follow up your CC with a slow to keep them from outrunning you, they can just keep going and get away eventually.
---
Same deal - the warrior in me dies hard. But then I got into healing and the Legion/BfA paladin is the ultimate in “class fantasy” – deep down I wonder if classic will just push me back to live.
---
Priest utility is nice, but at the end of the day in pvp pally is always the best. Anyone not named pally just explodes when 2 geared dps attack them. Pally bubbles and gets 12 second free casting. Bubble is ridiculously broken in vanilla pvp. And that's before you even factor in BoF, BoP, HoJ, BoSac etc...    
---
    
---
If your only priority is supporting others in pvp, pally is hands down the best.
---
look up defcamp and meldaron on youtube, best shaman guides on totems and weapon buffs, rockbiter is slightly better than windfury, with the luck driving windfury over or under.
---
Also imo enhance is very overrated for leveling, flurry and 5% crit is virtually the only scaling  bonuses that reduce lvling speed at all, no way they contribute more than resto or ele talents
---
Given what you've said here. I think sPriest is your better bet to start first. Say you don't get your second toon started until 4 months in, a druid is a lot better for avoiding ganks and such once there are a bunch of level 60s running around. Obviously if a 60 ganks you while you're leveling in Redridge or Stonetalon or whatever, you're gonna die, but a druid is basically unkillable against same level players. You can sustain and run so easily, its just not worth the time for the other player.
---
If you dont mind healing, you will probably find groups for dungeons a bit easier as a Priest as well. Not to say druids are bad at all, but the no regular rez is a bit of a hindrance if you dont have some friends playing classes than can do a regular rez as well. 
---
I say all this as someone whos going druid haha. Im planning on leveling a mage or warlock second.
---
You must be excited to farm shards again!
---
Based on this wall of text I didn't read I think you should just not play the game if you honestly can't control yourself.
---
that bad dps can scream bad heals all they want, I'm the one who decides they aren't worth keeping alive for this pack if they pull aggro
---
I'm struggling to decide a class, which is exactly what I did in vanilla
---
It already uses vanilla textures. The classic button just sets the video settings to be similar to true vanilla video settings.
---
I was thinking about this today, this is the one barrier that remains. I know this is true at least for my group. Once the amount of servers and server names/location are announced, players can finalize their plans with their group. And then when the name selection comes, that'll make it even more real and hype will be at an all-time high. Time is moving too slow.
---
That's a post from 2018 :)
---
At the end of the day they are responsible for aggro as much as you.
---
However if you want your dps to dps more. Use battleshout. If your party members are in range of your shout it generates a stupid amount of threat on all targets. Thunderclap isn't really that great since you'll be in battle stance. 
---
I saw it mentioned before but marking skull and x on large groups of mobs does wonders.
---
Finally if they continue to pull threat of your main target (if they're pulling side mobs then they're goons) swap to your dps weapons and try to keep up with your own damage.
---
Shadow priest is the least meme  of the meme specs. Some guilds even bring one for increasing lock dps. It depends on your raid roster. The more locks you run, the higher the chance of you being brought as an spriest.
---
I don't think you understood a lick of what I said.
---
People are going to chase world buffs, period, if it makes easy content ultra mega giga titanical easy, so be it, that doesn't negate my point that people will want to use world buffs.
---
I never said MC couldn't be cleared with 20 players. I never said classic was difficult, I think the gameplay is very fun, easy, and thematically satisfying, the hard part is finding enough good people (as in personality good)
---
Honestly not sure why you fired back at me with so many preloaded responses that have nothing to do with what I said, epic mount is a luxury, it won't enhance farming enough to pay for itself intime for BiS gear so you could skip it, that's my point. going from 160% to 200% is an increase of 25%.
---
That is really kind of you.
---
I just prefer specific iterations of DKP. You shouldn't get nothing from attending raids.
---
Or do power infusion disc/holy.  You get holy nova and some great pvp utility.
---
lol paladins are great for running stuff, what do you mean? Possibly the best.
---
Get reckoning and tap your /sit macro as quickly as possible. The sit status goes through instantly upon input, so if you're tapping it quickly enough you can catch auto-crits from multiple enemies and get a guaranteed 5-swing reckoning bomb. Combine that with a 3.6+ speed weapon and you'll just one-hit an elite per swing.
---
Run devotion aura with blessing of might (Seal of Command if you have it, if not Righteousness is fine). If you didn't have reckoning, you'd probably want to run ret aura instead but since you're gonna be one and done'ing everything, devo will be better for preserving your health. For damage, all you'll actually be casting is your seal, so all your mana can go towards sustaining yourself and you most likely won't have to drink often as long as you don't re-cast your seal needlessly.

Play what makes you happy! I am considering a druid I want to heal though, but something about a druid is super appealing. We can group up so you can rez and I can heal!
---
Shadow Priests can be replaced in most raids by a Holy Priest specing into Shadow far enough to get Shadow Weaving. This essentially replaces the reason to bring an actual SPriest so you can bring a higher DPS class like a War&gt;Rogue&gt;Mage. You better be in tight with the raid leader or else you won't be able to raid as Shadow spec.

There’s a better chance they run a holy priest spec into shadow weaving.

Well, that's ok for me. Only positive thing about midnight release in EU.

Server issues? Go to bed, wake up early and try again.

Nice

Thank you for that! When would you ever cast sbolt and when do you use certain curses?
---
oh yeah we never really looked into our fellow guildies loot and thought of that kinda stuff, like dps is low, gear up these dps guys. I see where thats extremely efficient but we didnt really care to go to those lengths.   
---
I agree with you, I think the system im talking about would be much more suited for casual PvEr's  
---
In the end though, if classic keeps going on there will be no need for any systems and well all have end game content eventually.
---
In the grand scheme of things it may add a small amount on to leveling time, but not a significant amount at all when we are tlaking about multiple hundreds of hours of leveling.
---
Same
---
Well, I usually ask politely to let me tank, cause threat is more problematic in vanilla, than in later MMOs. If they don't listen, I let them tank and put them into my ignore list.
---
It also entirely depends on the people you're grouping with.
---
If you're with a group that you executes boss mechanics perfectly then yeah, hunters might not be the best.
---
However, if you're with a group of average players and you put the work in and not stand in the fire then there's no reason why you can't be top dps.
---
To be fair though it's a hell of a lot easier to just roll a mage and spam frost bolt.
---
This is my exact dilemma. Priests and every other support/healers are noodles. 
---
But I do love, as mentioned, that priests can deal a bit of damage in return.
---
couldent DKP be taken away by the guild leader at his discretion?
---
THEX
---
That's true, thanks for the input
---
Listen to your heart, theres nothing else you can do. I dont know where your going, and I dont know why. But listen to your heart, before you tell shadow priest goodbye
---
This time will be different. If for no other reason than because you are different now.
---
I played as a hunter Tauren but I'll be playing classic with my SO. They're planning to roll a druid while I'm picking priest, we're also both going to be nelfs! I thought about playing hunter but honestly playing with someone else completely changes the class dynamic. They will be tanking as feral (most likely) and I'll be healing them!
---
So. You're mad that most people on the post have what happens to be the most popular opinion on the topic? Lol you're definitely a troll.
---
Thanks so much.
---
Can anyone recommend a few key mods? I'd like to get them ready during the Beta to hit the ground running once classic drops. I don't think i need more than DBM, Questie, Maybe weakauras, and a druid bar, but any advice is appreciated.
---
I agree that its probably overrated.
---
The only downsides I can really see with elemental is that its more expensive (unless a mage makes you water) and its worse in close quarters like caves.
---
Still gonna go enhance though as it feels more valuable in the early levels.
---
Yes you earn an extra roll. In a DKP system you earn gear. Guarenteed gear as opposed to extra chances. It's great that it worked for you in Wrath but I wouldn't want it for my guild in classic.
---
It doesn't matter what you okay as long as you are consistent and show up on time and with consumables. MC can be cleared with easily with 30 geared people who know what their doing. So if you can get a full group of 40 who can follow directions then it'll be fine. Most guilds will have a hard time filling all 40 spots, hell, my guild had a hard time filling 20 for mythic progression. Some people mentioned it, but you could find a warlock buddy and if you two come in as a pair then you're making him better and proving some utility to any other locks in the raid. 
---
But honestly, unless you're going for a hardcore guild, you will be okay to play spriest.
---
Which also explains why the mobs are harder and the quest rewards shitter! 
---
I hate Elwynn. Defuse, Murlocs, kobold caves.... yikes
---
Hell yeah I am!
---
You Met him and were zen. The power of naming
---
either way the gear gets out, DKP is more like currency where mulligan is like lottery I suppose.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7873rVbako

Exactly. Plus there are some very fun and interesting twists to DKP that can make it more fun.
---
Highest voted is the biggest asshole post. Send about right for this community
---
Druids can easily tank 5 man's too. So that's an option to change things up from raid healing.
---
I'm rolling a different class just so I can pretend this is a new game. Trying to to tarnish my happy memories with stupid adult memories.
---
Kind of offtopic but is there a site with every classic addon in one place?
---
like what?
---
One thing I’d like to suggest to this amazing guide you made.
---
Not positive it’s possible, but I believe so, is if you could allow picking multiple classes at once.
---
So if leveling with a friend, you could click both of your classes and see where you need to go.
---
It would really help if it’s something kind of easy to do, if not, not a huge issue. :)
---
Amazing guide, and honestly the best mobile experience I’ve seen from a WoW site, well done!
---
Feral is less meme than Spriest.
---
A failed divorce sounds like a good marriage?
---
Or do you mean a successful divorce?
---
Some of the best memories you'll ever have in game will come from wpvp in my opinion.  Highly recommend at least trying it for 20/30 lvls and see.  Some times it is frustrating for sure, but it's so worth it because the world becomes dynamic.  It becomes an adventure instead of a grind.
---
I'm happy for you man, I, unfortunately, can't find my WoW friends, I was in the Navy on shore duty during Vanilla-TBC and a few weeks before WOTLK dropped my shore duty ended and I went to C-School for 7 months. Then I got transferred to Hawaii and by the time I was settled back down with my family I returned to WOTLK near the middle of it only to find my guild had dissolved, most had transferred servers under new names I had no way of knowing before RealID was a thing. Now I check Vanillafriends.com every other week and hope I can just find 1 of them.
---
I'm on holiday during launch, but will probably be able to play on friday. Did not take off work, since I don't plan on being a hardcore player. So taking a couple months to reach 60 is absolutely okay with me =)
---
Addon scene for classic is fragmented right now. I'm using both Minion that downloads from wowinterface and the Twitch client that downloads from curseforge. Both have classic add-ons, but not one source has all.
---
Damn it! I was so excited I thought of something funny I rushed in and botched it.
---
level 40 warlock mount is free also
---
In some parts you actually want a mage to sheep first and then range pull, just coordinate with the group and set up exepctations from the start
---
yeah gear is shared a lot more huh
---
Interesting, I've never been suggested that idea before. I could do it as that's how the professions work. But then someone just wanting to switch the classes would have to deselect the existing one. How far does just selecting 'all' get you to what you want?

The world's longest recorded living bear was Debby, a female polar bear born in the Soviet Union at some point in 1966. She died on November 17th 2008 in Canada at either age 41 or 42.

---
Any idea or indication about when we’ll get the list of server names and associated types? Kinda wanting to figure out a guild but also wondering how established guilds and everyone else will all know what server to pick?
---
Anything you need from LW is BoE. No need to pick it up. 
---
Depending on your priorities during phase 1, because neither PvP ranks nor battlegrounds will be out, there’s an argument to be made for delaying engineering until later. If you do this, I would take two gathering professions and just make as much money as possible during phase 1.
---
After a bit of reading and youtube-ing, I'm split on Hunter vs. Rogue. I'm primarily trying to fit these characteristics:
---
* Scales well into endgame (high min/max potential)
---
* Primarily a PVE-er
---
* Good solo gold farmer
---
* Has potential to "hit the ground running" (benefit a lot from time investment at launch)
---
If either class has combat that akin to RS3, that would help my decision. In my time playing RS3, I found that even while under-geared I could regularly deal the most DPS in raid groups, so a similar combat rotation/style would probably fit me best.
---
Cast Flame Shock and Lightning Shield and auto from there. Let your mana regen somewhat. If you find your mana too low, drop the spell that does the least damage. Your goal is to be constantly killing, and only drinking when absolutely necessary.
---
and Dire maul east farming capability w/ that build
---
I need my fishingbuddy, but I wont riot without it
---
I don't think most of the posts were incinuating pulling threat from the tank, but rather starting the fights before the tank can pull to get initial threat
---
same, seems a lot of people are deciding between paladin and druid for some reason.  i played druid to 60 already so i think pala will be a nice change for me.
---
As a shadow priest arnt you gonna have trouble raiding? Even if you pvp you’re gonna have to do some raiding to get gear
---
I wouldn't say anything is mandatory unless you're at the very cutting edge of raiding/pvp. Herbalism is actually pretty useful for rogues, as herbs are needed for thistle tea and blinding powder. Ofcourse they are available on the AH, but gold is in short supply especially early on.
---
I guess it is part of a larger promoting plan.
---
seems like holy/reck build is like the druid 0/30/21 build.  can do everything you need to but nothing the best
---
The Warchief is disappointed in you.
---
That’s capitalism for you
---
Identical
---
That’s true, she couldn’t help herself when she came back for round two last night mate
---
Being at 305 skill removes the 1% hit negation mechanic. However the 5 skill also reduces miss rate by 2%.
---
If you think you'll play classic for less than 3 months - 100% follow your heart 
---
If longer, think about making it an alt :)
---
They re-implemented spell-batching, so it's possible again with the functionality of abilities/spells/talents that activate on a critical hit.
---
The trick is to stand right as the attack lands. If you're sitting when the server determines what kind of attack to give you (a critical hit), but standing during the next communication batch when it deals the damage to you and calculates the repurcussions it will trigger abilities that activate when you receive a critical hit.
---
The thing that causes it to fail is when it determines that you're sitting when the damage is actually dealt.

1. I want to main rogue or warlock (haven't decided yet). I know many people are leveling their mage first in order to grind some gold and gear up their warriors or whatever later, but in phase 1 there's no DM, for example, and farming potential of mages could be somewhat diminished. Now, I've never played vanilla other than leveling and know nothing about goldfarming besides some youtube videos/forum guides I've seen: whom should I level first? Or maybe rogue itself is enough to farm for my basics? Pickpocketing/mining/herbgathering in dungeons (ZG is phase 4 tho), organized devilsaur skinning, other kinds of resource gathering and grinding. I'm not entirely sure on the best phase 1 goldfarming strategies and I want to stockpile gold for future consumables-heavy activities.
---
I have a ton of free time to spend, especially during early stages of classic. And I mean like whole months of gaming with breaks for food and sleep. Please, give me a list of phase one eligible methods of farming (I'm asking for commonly known ones, not your secret strats). Thank you.
---
2. Wand progression, especially early game crafted wands (Lesser Magic Wand, at least): is it a good idea for a warlock to powerlevel tailoring/enchanting ASAP or will it be faster speedleveling-wise to just buy 15 lvl vendor wand later? On private servers those crafted wands seem to really speed up the leveling process (also they're cheap and plentiful on the AH), but questing during the first days of official classic will probably be about tagging mobs faster than other players, rather than killing them efficiently. Doubt there will be many opportunities for fear juggling and stuff.
---
You won't activate your subscription 2 weeks prior to launch to reserve 3 names? It's a pretty low cost.
---
fml
---
A 25% increase isn't minor.
---
 
---
And I'm pretty sure there's no world buffs to catch till later phases.
---
solo leveling speed will be absolute hell compared to other classes, keep that in mind if you care about that.
---

Underrated comment right here.

Still not in a hurry

Talk to them first, if they don't listen and continue pulling then yeah let them die.

I agree.

Ok, thanks very much for the reply :)
---
I've been considering rolling a Shaman because I remember windfury shaman 1 shotting me in Vanilla, but I'll likely be a night elf feral druid again then realize I'm on the bottom end of the spectrum in pvp.
---
Because Taunt is meant to be an emergency agro grabber, not a let off for over eager DPS. If something happens that requires taunt and it's on CD because you bailed out someone trying to be MLG pro then it leaves you floundering for those moments.
---
Feign Death + Jumper Cables ftw
---
Yep, D3 is the first game I regret buying after 3hr gameplay
---
I've never account shared? I don't understand
---
It is cross faction. He worded that poorly.
---
Yep. It's just a mage term used for some big fire baddies.
---
Ok, doesn't this mean that every current add-on should work in classic then?
---
Cheers matey thought so
---
If you’re in school it probably is, but most people playing classic seem to be returning players in the 25-35 range.
---
... who err, took the form or a gnome because they realise they are the superior race.. 
---
Fail.
---
I hated playing troll all through vanilla. But I actually have a sweet spot for shaman, always envied the orcs and taurens though lol
---
always follow ya shizzle hart
---
Looks really nice and you definitely spent a lot of time making it with this website. Well done.
---
Haven't looked into very much details yet but it seems to have some problems 50-60, I'm not sure that the xp will be enough and you may fall behind compared to the guide. You also do all the Silithus quests that won't be available at launch in p1, which will also be a big chunk of XP missing.
---
BRD is also included for a whole level which I would say is not good practice for a leveling guide, dungeons should always be optional or people who can't do them will feel really bad when they come to that part and don't know what to do.
---
Feral. But then at Max level... It's nothing. All the gear is too focused around being for multiple specs and the weapon stuff is messed up for feral.
---
I had actually forgot that concecration was in the holy tree xD
---
Will check it out.
---
I just recently installed the twitch app but I can't find the "wow addon" section there. How is it called?
---
maybe make a new character for that :p
---
&gt; Pvp is the same in classic once phase 2 is out and you can fight people with skill.
---
What? There's no ranked mode in classic. There's a ranked mode (Arena) in TBC&gt;. You'll face almost entirely bad players in classic, which is no fun to me.
---
It is known? Clearly not to all
---
all undead rogues are beta
---
It's a fair bet that Alliance will be just as outnumbered on PvP servers as Horde is on PvE servers. RP servers will be as or more Alliance than PvE.
---
The one 50/50 server type tends to be RP-PvP (like Emerald Dream) on Retail but this server type won't exist in Classic.
---
Why warlocks?
---
The MX series has been crushing it for so long.

wow. some of the things on there are just crazy, like listing the things we are ''missing out on'' patch by patch... like yeah some of it is genuinely good to have but... i think listing stuff like ''profession crafting time reduced'' beside ''dungeon finder'' is disingenous. one of them is a small QOL and the other completely shakes up the foundation of the game for better or worse
---
No druid trainers in UD starting area either
---
Rogues hit cap for 0% miss is absurdly high in my exp. Granted I am talking about private servers, I remember the hit cap being around 19%? I remember most guilds had a requirement of 14-15 % hit for fury and rogues. I had 18% hit on my rogue and still missed RARELY. Might just be pserver shenanigans.
---
I’m planning to do the same. Whats your motivation of the switch
---
you play the same way just with different talents, you rockbiter, searing, flameshock if you need it, stoneskin, manaspring, stay in spring range for 1/3 duration to break even, abuse clearcsating procs with shocks and rank 1 bolts/shocks by casting max rank chain.
---
The official site has a global countdown
---
For me it was the orginal cinematic with the dwarf hunter above Ironforge.. I was 13y old and super hyped for the game.  
---
Right now, getting up in the morning is tough man.. back then I woke up 1,5h before school to get some extra time into WoW.. :D
---
Theres an addon i love that just darke s the default UI. I think its called LortiUI. Ill definitely use that, elite player frame, dbm, and a damage meter. Potentially a gear database. That's all.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
High Agro spells and no threat reduction spells like Feign death, Fade or Vanish.
---
Warlocks have no way to reset threat, which becomes an issue if tanks are rage-starved.
---
Extra guild mats for something that wasn't going to help anyone so win win I guess.
---
No threat reduction or way to reset it
---
I tried killing critters on a pserver and never got skillups, I'm guessing that's a private server thing though...
---
Mages can spec into 30% less threat with their frost spells (also 30% less fire, 40% arcane).
---
Warlocks have no similar talent. One of the classic warlock memes is the "PLEASE DON'T CRIT" shadow bolt cast. They have no reduction and no threat reset (like feign death or vanish).
---
First, of course, explain that the tank needs to pull and get threat so its safe to DPS.
---
If they ignore this, are rude, or don't care... if they want the mob so bad, they can have it.
---
hit cap for yellows he certainly means.
---
I lost my virginity while this aired for the first time.
---
Even if it does not work all the time, whenever it does, you fell like a boss ;)
---
A threat meter for end-game raids (Warlock has no threat drop, unlike a lot of other classes).
---
A DoT timer for leveling. 
---
I don't have exact names but I remember KLH being a good threat meter and most dot timers are functionally the same but with different UIs.
---

I went on a DII binge a few months ago and logged in {one} day after they had auto-expired, was crushing...
---
With a hunter you can kill a mob and then send your pet in on another one while you loot, it’s incredibly efficient. Not to mention you rarely have to drink or eat and you have a movement speed buff very early.
---
I plan to farm rep to extinguish runes in MC, have extra consumes for other raiders, be a class leader, show up to every single raid, I would hate to roll off on my choker or dominance, looks fun but goofy. I would rather put in more effort and get more loot because of it.
---
good points.
---
Wiped after
---
It does for all standard swings, watch Punkrats Video.
---
Hey Judgement, thanks for the feedback and love your videos. Always looking to improve. Dungeons I feel are worthwhile while leveling are Uldaman (pre instance), ZF, BRD. SM sometimes for specific circumstances with efficient group. I've had grinding as the preferred approach and dungeons optional in the past during some of those segments particularly because I main a mage. But as a more general solution for every class to have dungeons preferred approach and grinding optional. I could message better about how much grinding would make up for the instance.
---
Regarding Silithus I know the most likely scenario based on the NPCs is that it won't exist on classic launch but leaving it be for the time being as no one knows for sure. Thinking of contingency plans in the event it isn't. I have tested the guide 1-60 myself 4 times in the past few months and the levels are pretty accurate with nearly no rested xp. If people log out in inns, sleep and work 8 hours a day it should be overkill.
---
&gt; we'll just be back at this place with people asking for vanilla wow servers again.
---
At least it will be easier the second time around.
---
I was 2401 in TBC, it really was. Good try though.
---
Space ships are a weird example seeing as they've been a part of WoW lore since TBC.
---
Run and quest there, silverpine, Hillsbrad etc... and then you still have to do cloth hand ins to get exalted
---
Will be hard thinking about law cases while figuring out my best lvling route
---
tbf thats a min-maxed thing, shadpriests will probably be run.
---
I think the whole cloth donation thing was added in later patches so potentially just questing?
---
Because you get crit once every 2min?
---
If you fight a rogue, you have a full reckbomb up, when leaving the stunlock. Holy reck is very reliable at delivering reck bombs, because they can sustain through the damage. Their reck bombs aren't as strong as ret recks, but they can do reliably do them. Ret reck has trouble getting full reck bombs up unless they have a pocket healer or are in AV, but they can 2-4k burst even with just a double or triple hit.
---
idk, when everyone was keyboardturning, that guy was someone to look up to
---
It’s confirmed that it’s going to be there from the start
---
It's one of the tabs across the top, called Mods
---
I played quite a lot of pvp in vanilla, and as I remember it you meet a lot of the same players all day long. You know who is good and it often become a noob grind in the middle, but objectives are often taken and guarded by good players. The more you play after phase 2 the more good and godlike players you meet. The dueling tournements are hard too.
---
If you only kill bad players in classic, I think thats going to be on you. Though you will ofc meet lots of noobs along the way.
---
Yes, quests give less rep. reward in classic.
---
Alot of warlocks will be suprised the first year
---
Can't agree unless you run only dungeons. You don't need optimal gear to run dungeons and you won't wear the cloth piece unless oyu heal a dungeon. A mage, priest or lock will wear it all the time. I'd much rather give it to them, so they can enjoy it for x levels instead of me, who uses it for 2-3 dungeons and then ditches it.
---
You don't need robes of arugal or any cloth item to perform your role, they are marginally better than a mail int/stam or int/spi piece. The only items you need to perform your role are ones with +healing. Guess how many of those are available before the endgame dungeons? Two maces, one from RFD, one from SM. Then we have a handful boe world drops, one quest reward and a couple crafted items. So the only bop dungeon loot are two weapons, where the cloth/plate discrepancy doesn't apply anyway.
---
Most guilds will not do that, only the «hard core» guilds will have someone willingly specc into that «useless» specc.
---
He is talking about PUGs. But I do not see why a PUG raid would go with more than 1 shadow priest (or any at all), so it will be very hard to find a PUG as shadow, as getting dps to fill a PUG is usually not a problem.
---
I'm not too worried about the time commitment, as I comped my iron in rs3 in 318 days, though I may feel differently in a month once I'm employed.
---
I appreciate the detailed response. I think I'll start with hunter and reroll to rogue as stages progress and rogues become more valuable for pve.
---
The community accepts/rejects ideas that the dev team proposes based on their design philosophies; it's not the other way around.
---
I'm taking two weeks off.
---
I'll most likely ignore the midnight launch and wake up around 6 AM, do a quick workout, eat breakfast, and start playing.
---
Food: Cook simple meals like tomato omelettes and sandwiches. Snack on pistachios, cashews, and grapes. Occasional McDonald's deliveries.
---
You might want to try some math or at least google a little
---
&gt; Given what you've said here. I think sPriest is your better bet to start first. Say you don't get your second toon started until 4 months in, a druid is a lot better for avoiding ganks and such once there are a bunch of level 60s running around. Obviously if a 60 ganks you while you're leveling in Redridge or Stonetalon or whatever, you're gonna die, but a druid is basically unkillable against same level players. You can sustain and run so easily, its just not worth the time for the other player.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If you dont mind healing, you will probably find groups for dungeons a bit easier as a Priest as well. Not to say druids are bad at all, but the no regular rez is a bit of a hindrance if you dont have some friends playing classes than can do a regular rez as well.
---
&gt; I say all this as someone whos going druid haha. Im planning on leveling a mage or warlock second.
---
agree :)
---
Also one in duskwood
---
a threat meter
---
a bag addon that combines bags
---
outfitter, or some addon that switches all your gear to a second set (great for druids who switch to caster)
---
Imagine ruining your life by having kids and an annoying cow that you have to sleep every night with PepeLaugh
---
I mean, when the tank takes 1min between pulls, even though everyone is full on mana, even I will start to pull, and I've been main tank for about 13 years, lock on classic. 
---
If you're being insanely slow, you're the one to blame, you are like the alpha in the pack, you decide where to go, what to pull and when to go, but if you stall for too long your companions, aka dps, will get bored and pull cause it's a waste of time to just stand for no reason what so ever.

1 You want to main a rogue or warlock and then come up with the example of warriors leveling a mage first. You don't seem to be wanting to roll a warrior lol, so just go with lock/rogue first whichever you want to main. Mages are great farmers sure and but like you said DM and ZG aren't out in phase 1. Warlocks can do Maraudon princes runs solo easy and rogues can do stealth runs, pickpocket, etc. Also, all classes can do gathering. Also, you could watch this video about other (lazy) ways to make money  by Punkrat: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EqobjvEPt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EqobjvEPt8) 
---
2. Warlocks aren't as dependanton wands as priests are, so I wouldn't worry about it too much (you can dot up multiple mobs with multiple dots and you can drain soul / life tap). You wand less than priests and you have no spirit tap (instead you can do life tap or improved drain soul, the latter which is used in combat). Also, if it's just mob tagging you are worried about, you don't need a *good* wand for that.
---
see...this is why they should do this stress test over the weekend, they will likely be basing the number of servers on the amount of account online and as such they will be lower than it would be if it was the weekend where EVERYONE can get on

Will my computer be able to run this?

If the screen mentions a filename with .sys extension then ti's most likely a driver that crashed, at possible solution could be to upgrade (or downgrade) the driver.
---
Gl finding a party when you reserve it :)
---
The way I would do this is to setup multiple WoW folders and use symlinks and hardlinks to the directories that you want to be the same, which is everything but the Interface folder.  
---
If you want to script it, PowerShell has these two native cmdlets:  
---
`New-Item $DruidWowDirectory -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value $ActualWowPath`
---
`New-Item $DruidWowDirectory -ItemType HardLink -Value $ActualWowPath`
---
Or, you could easy mode it with [Link Shell Extension](http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html)
---
Cheers bro this is the exact reply I needed. I appreciate it
---
Not if the dps moves the mob away from you, which is what almost all ranged, and panicking melees will do (got aggro? better run around aimlessly). Plus, even if the mob is near you: Less damage on the tank = less rage = less aggro.
---
Plus, sometimes people simply pull aggro, even if they overall play well. Back to back crits happen. And sometimes you, as a tank, will fail, and forget about a mob/not recognize that you missed an ability/waste your taunt, etc. Will you "punish" the dps then as well?
---
My point is not to defend bad dps. **My point is, that it doesn't pay off, for you or anyone else, if you try and "educate" your dps by endangering the group.**
---
If you have bad dps who constantly pull aggro, either bite the bullet, make up for their mistakes as best you can, and simply never run a dungeon with them afterwards, or discuss the issue with the entire group, leading to a removal of that player, or a disbanding of the grp.
---
You have 5 people there. Accepting wipes to "punish" one guy, is hurting yourself, and 3 people who did nothing wrong. People won't remember a bad dps. But they will remember a misbehaving tank.
---
Ok, thanks. I will check after work ;)
---
players are not what lead to TBC (and eventually BFA), money is what lead there. The original game was designed to be just azeroth as is (its why it's huge), and content added to it. but money (aka. sell the game again) is why they created TBC, which is a very small version of the game with very limited content, and if you liked vanilla, though luck, you had to buy the expansion if you cared about playing with other players and experiencing new content (which is the point of an MMO). post TBC, the game also became far more themeparky, wrath was essentially just a themepark storyline all the way through with phasing and everything, and adding of queues, so DALARAN was essentially where every player was unless they had queued up with strangers to grind something, no one was having fun anymore, friends and community died with the mega server infrastructure too, and they just kept doing that to each expansion ever since.
---
Original vanilla is a much different game from the expansions. vanilla is more like everquest, where the world is vast, open, and with lots of different activities you can engage in that do not connect to the "grand story of *you*", in vanilla, you're a nobody in this world, and you make a name for yourself in a real way; by interacting with players, they know who you are, you know who they are, they respect or despise you, and you play the game as a social experience, where each day is new, different, and fun, because you're playing it with other people. everyone is in it together and reputation and communication play a vital role in the actual gameplay and enjoyment of the game itself.
---
the expansions are all about "you" the "hero", as a story entity, there is no mmo, no multiplayer, it's basically just a job. not a place you go to hang out with friends and go on adventures, but a place you go to meet your co-workers for a task, and once done, you clock out. the experience is always the same because the objective is structured and set in stone. no flexibility.
---
so yeah, runescape did good, so did dofus. adding new content to the core world is a good thing, because the fun of the game was always the social aspect. you made new adventures each day, and they were all unique. if they go in the direction of TBC+, it is no longer "classic", and at least I will not be around for the ride. I could never enjoy the game since TBC anyway, I keep buying every expansion, play through the story to max level, do all the quests, get the first tier gear from dungeons and raid, skill up my professions, and then there's nothing left to do other than wait for the next raid, because there is no point in going out into the world since there is no one there and nothing to do and it's just ~6 zones that you've explored through quests already (because there are no easter eggs or secrets or interesting thing in them); and that's all there is.
---
Is a lot of the game played in vacuum?
---
I am pretty sure Mind flay does not fizzle, it didn’t on pserver, and I have no memory of it doing it on retail vanilla (I played as shadow sometimes).
---
.sys extension eh? Okay, I'll remember that and if it happens again on Thursday I'll look out for that, thanks.
---

Affliction can be strong, especially in Alterac Valley: you dot everybody while they can't attack you because you stand somewhere hidden or inside the zerg. Then they die. You win.

Anyone got a link to a good Paly leveling build. All the ones I’ve found on google are different and many based on /sit which is no longer a thing.
---
A tank that marks all the pulls and holds agro on all the kill targets is misbehaving? I think you are really underestimating players ability to understand the basics of group play. Let me touch on a few of your points specifically 
---
&gt;You have 5 people there. Accepting wipes to "punish" one guy, is hurting yourself, and 3 people who did nothing wrong.
---
Having the dps be accountable for their play isn't going to be wiping groups. It plays out like this. The tank marks the group for kill, cc, and secondary targets. The tank pulls the group and the dps apply cc. The dps then apply damage to the skull target and rotate damage to each secondary target as they die. If a dps places damage on the wrong target they will take agro and start to receive substantial damage. If they die or drop threat it goes back to the tank and the fight continues on normally. It will be immediately apparent when a mob with a big X kills a dps that they weren't focusing the right target. No wiping involved.
---
&gt;Plus, sometimes people simply pull aggro, even if they overall play well. Back to back crits happen. And sometimes you, as a tank, will fail, and forget about a mob/not recognize that you missed an ability/waste your taunt, etc. Will you then "punish" the dps as well?
---
This is a perfect example of how marking the targets creates accountability within the group. If the dps are out threating the tank on the kill target then the tank is held accountable and can focus more on threat generation. This system simply finds the problem immediately and enables players to fix it.
---
spriest was quite superior in terms of actually making a difference in team battles. Druids were better in capturing/protection or flag running. However overall spriest is a lot more fun, especially for AV.
---
Spell pushback and some extra damage.

That's why I don't ever do dungeons, and how sadly I don't think I'll ever do raids. I've become caregiver for my parents and I sometimes have to suddenly leave the computer and go help them. I can't commit to a multiplayer team. Sucks but it's better than joining and dropping on the team.
---
I was a shadow priest in vanilla and I also worked overnights so I didn't have a lot of time to commit when your average group was raiding.  I learned it's a bad combination.
---
If your main interest is PVE and you want to casual raid do not stay shadow.  A guild might bring one shadow, but they will likely bring a ton of holy/disc priests.  You can get into a raid casually to heal, but nobody will want a casual shadow with all those who dedicate themselves to making it work.
---
There is so much more dps than healers in the game.  Optimization aside, it only benefits you to heal.
---
Can probably get someone to make it, if you play in a guild usually one will have what you need. Then just bring the mats and a hug.
---
Rogues and warriors are probably warlocks hardest counters. That said, sacrifice your VW and you might be able to get in a fear which you can then spam on rogues. Warriors you just have to kite with curse of exhaustion, shadowbolt and succubus
---
Rogues and hunters should all have that.
---
i love uldaman, i remember the first time we went there it was awesome! nice video. looking so much forward to play it again.
---
The only issue I had with BfA was not being able to chat to guildies.
---
Small drop chance from that rare spawn in AH? The trinket is amazing though, gonna get it eventually.
---
me either. so many fucking dme runs
---
Things like this are normally based on the local server time.
---
Casual raiding guild may be fine. Increased shadow damage from Shadow Weaving comes with the chance of locks pulling aggro or having to throttle their spells, and it also takes up a valuable debuff slot which is important for encounters like Magmadar where one must remain open for tranq shot.
---
Lots of people here saying they've had a positive experience but me personally I wouldn't see raiding as shadow viable unless your guild is really willing to accommodate, and if they don't care then they likely aren't aware of the liability it could be.
---
I would say functional enough. Just would have to skip here and there, not a huge issue, and saves time from having to swap back and forth.
---
3 hour intervals server time starting 00:00
---
Source?
---
Not saying you're wrong, would love for this to be true and be able to share it with others :)
---
Ok? retard?
---
Also only one talent that reduces threat which they have to sacrifice 10/15% damage to use.
---
once a troll always a troll. goin shaman this time though. but i anticipate getting fed up with shit tanks and reverting to warrior..
---
Cheers mate, I'll update the post.
---
Got the week off work. I know there's a chance the launch could be a bit rough, but part of the excitement is chatting to people here on Reddit, watching the drama unfold. I imagine it will be fine but still...
---
They don't advertise legion/BFA coz MMO section is dead. Lil zoomer does not want to spend hours n hours to get blue item, lil zoomer whants new pay2win skin every now and then and fast paced gameplay.
---
Shadow is literally one of the strongest 1v1 classes in the game, and very useful in the raid environment. People who claim it's a meme spec likely haven't played Vanilla or they don't have a brain!
---
Kinda fun to see the chaos though. It's something that only happens once and never comes back. Sure, I will be incredibly frustated after day 1 and only being level 8, but it will be a fun ride :D
---
Find a warlock to team up with for 5 man dungeons so you can dps boost with The debuffs.
---
This is awesome! Super handy, thanks.

Looking at the Classic Wowhead site, their data has possibly been fixed, based on the rep amounts suggested [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/reputation-gains-seem-to-be-off/177300) to have been listed in classic databases previously - looking at Elwynn Forest as an example I'm seeing rep rewards between 50 and 100, as opposed to 250.
---
I am going to map out all the 1-40+ Stormwind rep quests and see just what is possible with Classic Wowhead's current numbers, and if it's worth it I'll modify a leveling guide to try to include all of the rep quests before they're grey.
---
I have the Aug 26th- Sept 9th off. I'm getting a bunch of thc cartridges for my vape pen, a few cases of Pepsi Max. The weekend before I'm going to meal prep and freeze a bunch of chicken stir fry, spaghetti, and green chile con carne. I'm gonna no life it pretty hard the first few days, and then settle in to a 5-7 hour of game time per day average. I dont expect to hit 60 that first week. I want to be at the front of the wave not far ahead or stuck in the middle. I want the world to be populated but not crowded. I want to do a lot of dungeons while I level with lots of people. I even have some magic mushrooms I'm saving for my first Gnomer. But I know I will get burnt out sometime in the mid 30-40s like I always do. And I hope my IRL friends will be coming back and I'll need to have an Alt ready.  I want to enjoy the Launch and Levelimg my main. But I also want to be doing MC regularly before October so I can farm DKP and snag the 4 items from MC I actually need but people dont want to give Feral Druids.

I think they were implying you don't get the next reset on the item or mob and potentially pushing the time to complete the quest much higher than the respawn or reset timer alone.
---
Yeah my bad, meant righteousness. Thanks

I usually eat pretty healthy and avoid sugar. But at least one day during launch week (possibly launch day or a day during the weekend), I'm going to chuck a bag of potato chips and 1.5 litres of Coca Cola in celebration of nerddom.

I would guess Oceanic will have 2 PVP, 1 PVE, 1 RP.

I didn't play vanilla so what do you actually get from this arena chest?
---
Only if you want a special name it might be worth it to do that, I don't see the benefit for myself.
---
Most users are probably fine just waiting for release and paying then. In a way it's just a form of micro-transaction for a name, although blizzard probably hopes that you'll play normal retail in the 2 weeks of waiting.
---
Taking 3 weeks off to play the game. If I get bored after the first 2 weeks, I will cancel my remaining days and go to work again. If not, I will (hopefully) have satisfied my lust for Classic and can go back to casual play rates.
---
damn...this old forum layout :&gt;
---
anyone remember when a blueposter blizz acc got hijacked and the hacker spammed the forums with random shit? 
---
i think it was a murloc avatar. not sure tho, too long ago.
---
Why wouldn't it be? Equip prot gear and spec and just pull the whole dungeon while using consecration. Thanks to BoSanc, you'll barely take any damage, while block reflecting and consecrating opponents down.
---
I did the same during Vanilla, but didn't enjoy the healing on level 60. So I went back to my rogue for TBC.
---
I think they are great, coupled with really any other class. They hold their own in skirmishes that happen, while leveling up, but solo roaming wpvp they seem lacklustre.
---
The best case scenario: they really want to kill you, then you'll likely end up killing them, but the moment they're flighty and you don't have a curse of exhaustion, they'll just be gone and there won't be too much you can do about it. Once the fight turns against you, you'll also mostly just die, unless you're going big on consumables (invis, swiftness pots, cloaking device, etc.) to have an escape plan.
---
I don’t necessarily care - that’s partly my question. Is there a strong reason to maximise my rep with those factions which would involve me trekking around Azeroth and slowing down my levelling progress?
---
You can use Questie addon that shows every quest giver on map.
---
That's awesome, though I don't really understand the whole "going back to old equipment for the sake of nostalgia" thing.

I for one can't wait to be able to enjoy Vanilla in high res and 144hz.

Here some tanking tips:

---
Druid is an option, but it lacks some essential stuff, like Vanish, Gouge and Kidney Shot.
---
A green +5 stamina trinket and some random loot. Hand in 12 of them and you get a blue trinket that absorbs ~750-1200 damage
---
if they pull they tank said mob
---
True. It's just sad to know that all the players that are coming back to experience vanilla may end up getting shafted by mechanics that led them leaving/the retail mess.
---
Layering from day one onwards until who knows how long. Cross-realm BGs from day 1 that they're implemented. 
---
What's next? "Hey this Meeting Stone system is already there, let's fast-track it into becoming the LFG tool!"?
---
Guess I worded that poorly, sorry for that.
---
What I meant with the "no cross-faction" remark is that all Goblin Auction Houses are connected with each other, but not with the Alliance or Horde ones. 
---
However, Alliance and Horde players can use the Goblin Auction Houses to trade cross-faction as long as they visist the auctioneers in either Booty Bay, Gadgetzan or Everlook.
---
But.. Lil zoomer thinks he knows what he wants - but he doesnt!
---
As you are OCE it will follow Sydney time keep that in mind when dst comes around as it requires a server restart to swap to the new 3 hour increment. When it goes back an hour the chest will spawn at 1, 4, 7 instead of 12, 3, 6 etc until next server restart.
---
True. The initial clusterfuck is part of the experience. It will never come back. If you go the exploration route, you will also miss out on a lot of rep I think.
---
What if you never knew a streamer was playing on your server?
---
With regards to the Auction House follow the *no buy, only sell* philosophy.  You will save more money that way.
---
Basically this. It's an ease of use UI. Whilst it won't be as perfect for each individual, It arguably (probably) will look better and will definitely take WAY less time. All while adding the general standard stuff people want in a custom UI.
---
Personally I cant get any of those types of UI's even close to what I want and I usually build my own from bits over 2-3 days. I enjoy UI building, I know, I'm weird.
---
Im studying 9 to 4 every day and I have two kids. For me its realistic to play 2-4hr a day. Depending how much I have to do in school. Im soon starting my internship, should free upp evenings some, but then irs probably 8 to 5 instead.
---
Shaman has no good PvE DPS specs, and feral cat DPS is right on the border between meme and adequate, too.
---
I'm guessing the serverl ist comes after the stress test, so between Friday and Monday.
---
It's noticable on the desktop bro
---
I think a lot of people believe that they'll be able to get 40 of just the classes they want all the time - rather than just getting as many people as they can together who are available when they raid and packing the gear and consumables necessary to down the content.
---
Unless you are a streamer or taking vacation I dont see it happening. Like you say, a large portion of the returning players from 2006 should be around that age now.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=216087&amp;region=us
---
&gt;we’ll let you know the names of the Oceanic realms before name reservations start on August 13.
---
Did they forget about the other side of the pond again? Because nothing the likes is showing up on the EU launcher -.-
---
I'm fascinated by those keybinds. Maybe I'm a philistine but I've never seen people use the Insert, Home and Page Up etc. keys. Is this a common thing?
---
Also now I'm considering a Warlock again for classic. My most played class and first love, but I really wanted to level a Warrior and Mage this time around. But the good old Warlock playstyle calls me.
---
This is what the author posted on Gitlab:
---
&gt;Hi, thanks for your positive feedback. But sadly there won't be a classic release from my side.
---
The addon is based on databases provided by opensource-server implementations (VMaNGOS, CMaNGOS, Mangos-Zero). Those communities have put an incredible amount of efforts into making them as they are right now. Since Activision-Blizzard is obviously not going to opensource their databases/server-code, the addon would become more and more off over the time, whenever they decide to change anything. I once wrote a script to parse data directly from Wowhead which was super slow and lead very soon to an IP block which made me split the queries across several days (long story short: I stopped that work on day 3). And I'm not going to do that again.
---
However, the whole pfQuest code is opensource (MIT-License) so everyone is free to fork and port the work to classic and its future changes if they want. I already heard some rumors on discord about a few people who announced they would do that.
---
I don't have any intentions to port any of my addons to a moving-target API. My plan is to bring pfQuest/pfUI to Vanilla, TBC and WoTLK at a given time. Basically every core that is supported by CMaNGOS, as it allows me to test stuff on a local instance, without the need of porting it over and over again to each API change.
---
Really really well as the ganker, especially if you have time to prep like change pets or trinkets or what have you.  I'd say 3/9.  Maybe only 2nd behind rogues. 
---
Better than most as the gankee.  More like 5/9.
---
Unless you're SL, then you can dumpster almost anyone except super well geared druids and priests, who will outlast all your mana, health, bandages, pots, whipper roots, and anything else you can convert to damage.
---
Horde: Undead for sure
---
Alliance: Nightelf I'd say
---
It's pretty much the bottom of the barrel in PVE because you never really ramp up, you basically just vamp touch, devouring plague (if undead), swp, mindblast, mindflay mindflay, mindblast, mindflay mindflay, recast SWP, you'll be OOM most of the time yeah... Life in 5mans is pretty rough, keep in mind you can only have VT up on one mob at a time and you won't have any AOE... SWP and mindblast cost massive mana..   
---
Would not recommend this class in PVE unless there is some new meta advancement with Spirit (there may be a lot of potential with going full spirit but all that it would do is keep you from going OOM as fast, and you'd take a dps hit because you'd basically be playing catch up with all of the other DPS and there isn't much room in your small rotation to squeeze in anything other than mindflays.  
---
Leveling is great. World PVP is second only to rogue in my opinion. This is a PVP spec and that's really where it shines.
---
I vote for stopping with the Thex stuff. It's not funny anymore D:
---
Engineering is more than often a moneysink. I recommend picking up mining and skinning. You can bank the mining materials for later and just vendor the skins for extra gold. 
---
This works very well for grinding beasts from lvl 30 onwards. The ones in Desolace are very profitable as they not only drop valuable trash but you can also vendor stacks of leather. 
---
I recommend grinding mobs for a lvl or 2 for most classes, as it is more profitable than questing in terms of gold.
---
Im going skinning / herb, vendor all skins and stack herbs on bank alt. Will drop skinning for (most likely) alchemy at 60.
---
Dont train skills you dont need pre 60. At 30-40 each skill is around 1g, so that can easily save you around 30g.
---
They have increased base range, not leeway.
---
If you can survive the initial opening, And they aren't prep spec, you win.
---
Played mage in vanilla clearing naxx. Never ever heard of problems with restodruid at any level of content. Had restodruids healing 5mans with a dps war tank all the time. That was not a naxx raider more like mc/bwl. Our top healer was druid who got atiesh.
---
Hiding under stairs, entrance too small for any other race
---
yea, when I tank I don't like mobs running at my healer.  Also if you let a dps tank what they pulled, sometimes they panic run and wind up pulling more (at least it's funny).  So I pull the mob(s) off the dps.
---
After that I ask them nicely to knock it off and if they do it again I kick them.
---
You are talking about the dual wield white dmg hitcap, which is 24%. 9% is the hitcap for single 1h weapon or 2h weapon as well as for all abilities. In general, dual wield classes call 9% softcap, as the gain from hit is lessened after achieveing this.
---
Nice idea, you will have it when they release TBC.
---
why not? I enjoy it quite alot actually, for the past 3 weeks all I did was to practice leveling routes, an order when to visit cities to train/buy something etc. on a private server. I am also attempting to hit server first aswell. Sure thats not for anybody but I love leveling in WoW and beating your own records are a good incentive for some ppl.
---
First of all, in MC hunters are not that bad, they do just fine. BWL too, but you start to get to the lower end. Afterwards your DPS simply suck. It should also be noted that a few hunters are going to be in any raid for utility purpose.
---
&gt; If I played the rotation perfectly, does that give me a chance at topping dps meters or will it never be good enough?
---
It's vanilla, there is no such thing as playing rotations perfectly because rotations hardly exist. Honestly, if you can't play it perfectly then you should not even be in the raid. Hunter is among the more "complex", and that is only because some classes literally spam *one* spell. Hunters are also braindead easy, but compared to one spell they are slightly more fun. Still, you won't be able to somehow redeem hunters poor DPS once it goes downhill.
---
I'd probably never recommend a hunter for purely PvE unless you really like the kiting / tranq playstyle and are okay with being one of 2-3 hunters in a raid (so can be hard to get a spot).
---
Ahh, an excellent ganking guide. Thanks, Alliance scum. Lok'tar Ogar!
---
doesn't change the question :/
---
Why the change? Just for the lore?
---
I remember doing it on both my warlock and shadowpriest in vanilla. You just get the scepter from a "normal" / full mara run (its a questline), but once you get it you can skip 80% of the dungeon. You just dot/kite princess around the island and loot stuff. You can even do some other bosses like the mountain giant and the crocodile, but it's not necessarily more gold per hour than just killing princes and teleporting out (by leaving party) and resetting.
---
It aint DM:N solo hunter gold farm gold per hour rate, but it's still quite good
---
Playing different healing classes since TBC exclusively. My mentality is, if the tank let's the DPS die, I'll let him die. Always Side with your tank.
---
Yes exactly, when I started speedrunning and making my guide I stayed in Elwynn to 10+ and had 1h30min to 10 quite easily, but in the long run I found out it was better to leave early and get to Loch/Darkshore ASAP
---
You guys already have a nickname you are gonna use ?
---
But I must say - if Spriest is in your heart - consider warlock.
---
Sometimes I really wished I had gone warlock.
---
It looks and feels much nicer. Perhaps it's foolish to say that it will make or break your gameplay but it certainly makes things easier on the eyes.
---
Ooof, definitely not going to be playing a Warrior then. Super annoying gameplay, but the benefit of the exploit is too good not to make use of it.
---
Hahaha nice, there's a certain appeal to that actually. But ill be going F orc probably using deviate delight.
---
No summoning stones.
---
You should be fine. I would advice to test it and be careful with VPN since some IP are banned.
---
Idk if I'll have the time :/
---
How did you survive those 4 hours ?
---
If you're Disneyland security then we probably met when y'all threw me out c;
---
Set it up during the stress test then copy over your WTF file
---
I don't like the purple.
---
crystal charges are and they have the same dps outout :3
---
This is the kind of shit I'm excited for. Classic had Sense of community
---
If you need tonuse cds , use them. When your healer leves you with 3 braindead dos gl finding new one asap
---
Far too clever for a Monday morning
---
Private server to classic or the other way around will for most of the addons not work. Setup your addons during the stress test!
---
but comes not with phase 1 i thought
---
Rogue has a much higher damage potential in (endgame) raids, but Hunter offers a lot more versatility and contributes massively to dungeons and solo play. So, depends on what your focus will be on :)
---
Yeah, most cases where DPS start pulling comes from the tank being exceedingly slow.
---
I've been in groups where I just tell the tank that I need \~50% mana as a healer before he pulls, but he still stands around and waits for my entire mana pool to recover.
---
A good tank can set the pace of the dungeon to what the group can handle.
---
Oh really?  I had forgotten about those but now that you mention it..  it was something like 2 or 3 people channeling could warp people in or something?
---
So in vanilla everyone has to walk there then?   Good, even better that way.
---
No way, how can this beat centaur tribes sending the best level 10 warriors to destroy Barrens?  
---
Instead of like... 5 regular Desolace Centaurs to fuck this place up.
---
Of course this is a very severe change. the 10 % more parry chance will have a lot of effects. I mained a maintank up to a third of naxxrams in vanilla, and never toucehd a private server, and  following are the  implications i can see from having the correct parry mechanic compared to the private servers mechanics:
---
Threat will be reduced by 10-14  %overall.
---
Thats not that huge, overall, but what counts is the huge increase in "misfortunate events".  (double / triple/ quadrupole non-hit streaks)
---
The chance for a tank´s  attacks to miss (8)/dodge  5/parry (14) , together ca 27 is doubled in comparison to private server mechanics. so unlucky streaks at the beginning of a fight are going to happen 4 times as often as on pservers, dps and heals, hold your fingers calm until there is some threat.
---
 (nope this naxx speed run trashpulls on youtube from pservers where tank just runs in and has everything after 2 seconds WONT happen in live.)
---
Incoming tank  dmg will be increased , because the boss gets parry haste a lot. 
---
The spikiness will increase hugely, especially on lower geared tanks.
---
The chance of a crushing blow comes from a mob hitting more than 2 attacks within a 6 second shield -block window, and this will happen way more via the additional attacks from parry, on lower side of gear.
---
The meta of "dua wield tanking" like on private servers will rofl stomp any tank quickly.  14 % parry and 25 % miss chance on your offhand wont make a decent amount of threat, it will make the boss parry-haste even more. tanks trying this  will be getting crushed like mad, the tradeoff threat vs survivability is blown completely on pservers.
---
Paladin tanks are getting the axe even more compared to pservers, druids will still be fine although their threat is reduced severly (druid rage comes from attacking way more than warriors, so druids will be hit more severely by having the correct mechanics. slow autoattacks getting parried triple as often = severe reduction of rage income  and threat for the bear, but i think druids will still be fine)
---
Another stuff: lower speed tanking weapons will be better in comparison. I personally liked to tank with a 2.6 i think 1hand axe on classic on  horde, for those juicy windfurys (rage) and because of less parry haste. Most of the rage as tank comes from incoming dmg and blocks and anger management, not from your puny attacks. 
---
So try to find a not to fast tanking weapon, which was common knowledge 14 years ago.
---
 Also off-tanking builds with flurry (30% faster attackspeed on crit)  suffer a lot in survivability when applying the correct parry mechanics.
---
In general, the correct parry mechanics make sure that deep prot is the only real way of tanking in classic, and the community back than knew it, and nothing has changed with this. 
---
Paladins and druids and dua wield warrior tanking are a pserver thing due to faulty mechanics and should stay there.
---
Deep prot is the way of decent tanking in 99% of the cases.
---
I usually get around 5d as a Paladin solo, but that is done solo on repack server, so it's both easier and harder then it will be on classic, but my goal is slightly below 5d on classic release
---
Same with me. My bros and I are looking at playing again, haven't really played with each other (BfA was the first time we actually had a chance to play) since I was in high school. We are all pretty excited about playing Classic together. I live in Germany now for a bit, so that's going to be a challenge I'll have to get to play with them.
---
What server did you all play on in vanilla?
---
I think you are deliberately exploiting an ambiguity in their phrasing to cause trouble.
---
Taunt has a cooldown. Rage is finite. If you are being forced to waste rage and cooldowns by one DPS being an idiot, you don't have rage and cooldowns in the tank for when something else goes wrong. If too many things go wrong then the group wipes.
---
One way or another the idiot DPS needs to be re-educated or kicked, or sooner or later you will wipe because of them.
---
The armor values are lower in classic compared to private servers so this might more than make up for the increase in parry chance by bosses. A podcast I listened to calculated most bosses will  be at 0 armor after all debuffs.
---
Theyve changed it a few times but I think its any weapon in its current version. IDK for sure though, BFA was really underwhelming.
---
re/DIWhy
---
If you have a warlock friend they can summon you in the same way the summoning stones work, but for most of your dungeons the entire party will have to walk there indeed.
---
Exactly, PUGs will be happy to fill all forty slots. The idea they'll be picky about specs, jees...
---
TPS will be higher compared to pservers because of way reduced Armor. Melees might also do more way more dmg. Casters will be fine to go max DPS if your tank knows his shit.
---
Summoning stones did nothing in vanilla. You could hover them and it said the dungeons name and level range, that was it.
---
I'm going in the opposite direction. I love my PvP and anything to help combat the rogue stunlock is needed.
---
There is still a point where it's exactly 12:00, your example does not change that. And  exactly 12 is midday, while 12:00:00:00:63 is past midday - which is not the time I'd mean when I say 12.
---
It won't hurt them aggro wise. Armor is way lower so tanks will do more dmg/tps compared to pservers. Also Warlocks won't be able to do much dmg until Phase 5 either way.
---
A mulligan is giving the person with more raid attendance a higher opportunity to get the item, so it isn't completely random.
---
Glyphs were a wotlk addition.
---
Dishonored kills for players were implemented for a while, but they decided to remove it. I don't remember why.
---
Oh, damn 😅 so only JC in tbc?
---
The latest pserver released in late June already has 14% parry and other beta data in it. 
---
Despite being slightly more than 1 month old, I think more than half of the Naxx is cleared already. And it does not seem that anything changed much.
---
Haha I'll have to see if we decide to wait for one another or just go on. Prot will allow bigger pulls and I play Prot Endgame anyways.
---
depends on how and when they do it. also on if they are getting on my nerves.  
---
usually I ignore it and carry on.  
---
if they overdo it I normally let them tank it or even let them die.
---
sometimes healers think they should let you die in return then for w/e. being friends with the dps or god knows why.  
---
then its time to leave and look for another group.
---
Only ony head  ,but that means that people just go kill ony
---
The truth is the truth
---
Just talking about visuals, most T1 sets have pretty garbage stats.
---
Don’t do it
---
Same for me. Was supposed to be free the launch week but i have to come in for work. And i will be free the week after that
---
Same. We have like 15 irl friends all getting together for a WoW party a week before launch. Then the 15 of us will dissolve into Azeroth and mold at our toes. Can't wait.
---
What server did you play on?
---
The Desolace centaur are champions who defend Maraudon, their sacred home. Can t leave it unguarded
---
How much time would this take?
---
Do you mean the rank 11 one?
---
The only actually improved version, the questing addon only exists because it was targeting private servers, and he could have full access to the games database during development.
---
It would never work on retail, and he gave up trying to port it to retail because it was taking to long to scrape it all from wowhead.
---
casual spotted
---
3h daily is not a lot of time when you account for longer sessions on weekends.
---
Yep. Although it really mattered because most raid gear had multiple gem slots.
---
Glyphs existed but they were shoulder and head enchants you got from rep vendors
---
Nobody should play prot paladin. Their viability as tanks is super limited. Pretty much only dungeons and even then they're worse than warriors because now the tank has to take mana breaks too.
---
Tell him the basics of pulling with bow
---
Pooling rage so people don’t insta pull aggro (10-20 rage is fine)
---
Rotation for low level instances: bloodrage after pull, revenge when up -&gt; sunder, shield block on hard hitting bosses and trash packs to proc revenge and reduce incoming damage slightly
---
On multiple targets: Tab targeting sunders and demo shouting
---
Marking! Important to have atleast skull, cross and moon bound for quick marking
---
Teach him how taunt works, and how you can use other players damage then taunt and get their threat (can start sundering X, and taunt skull after that and then tank it)
---
Since you are the healer, communicate with him about your mana
---
Tanking really gets better with experience of course, but for 14-40 instances mobs dont hit hard and it’s not a wipe if mobs hit dps couple of times, so the main focus should be in making proper pulls so the pulled packs stay relatively small and under control.
---
Don’t let him spec prot, tell him to spec arms and after 2 points in tactical mastery he can switch stances and use mocking blow as an extra taunt, and switch back to def stance.
---
You can teach him this stuff by time, don’t overwhelm him. Pulling and rotation is most important and should be the main focus. Once those are under control he should start learning rage pooling etc
---
yeah, just FYI half the priest population would kill for that one sp spot so it’s not going to be a walk in the park to get it.
---
&gt; Because Taunt is meant to be an emergency agro grabber
---
Says who ? Using taunt as a threat generator in dungeons is the most effective way to do them. Unless you're completely incompetent you will never **need** taunt in dungeons. The chance of the healer generating so much threat that taunt is required is pretty much non-existent. Instead you're way better off using a relatively short CD repeatedly to generate a bunch of threat without spending any rage, which is a much much more valuable resource in dungeons.
---
Nelf druids named Killmongerrr, probably.
---
Hunter can top meters in MC.
---
Took 3 weeks off... just in case.
---
Druids can absolutely tank 5mans, but warriors can too and will have an easy time getting into raids as OTs if you change your mind after realising what a time commitment raiding sometimes isn't. Not an easy decision.
---
I'd say they're pretty on par with mages for PvP but in different areas of expertise. Once you get some decent gear, you can have immense burst damage as a warlock.  
---
PvE though yes, mages are a notch above warlocks when you are looking at damage, QoL and overall ease of use.
---
That was not my intention, i have just never played at such a High level (raiding and late game dungeons) which seems to be the sole focus of a lot of you guys (My beloved older brother included) so im not used to the min-maxing-focus on the late game. It seems to me that most people on this forum expect you to be an expert on every aspect of this huge game (as in if youre not doing everything 100% right and making bad decisions youre intentionally throwing/trolling) I get the point but i am afraid that the overzealousness of some of these people having played wow classic both original and on private servers for decades now might be harmful for the experience of newer players. The question was actually genuine.
---
Druids are the best dungeon tanks. And the best off-tanks. 
---
And they surely get spots in the raid by being a healer. So idk what those people are talking about.
---
Am I a Protection Paladin? When I will be healing but I have more points in protection then holy
---
honest question, can I just NOT do water totem until 60?
---
Questie is overrated. Its like being handheld through the game.
---
I can't decide if I want a paladin or priest
---
not most but all
---
The main things are to not spend money on skills you don't need and to not spend money on stuff at the AH.
---
Outside of that think about how much getting a mount AT 40 matters to you vs. simply waiting an extra level or 2.
---
That fix was around and functioning properly on Nostalrius/Anathema etc and you still saw a lot of warlocks being in the very top DPS spots.  
---
If warlocks do have a problem with damage, it's seemingly not the resist fix atleast.
---
Nope. That would have been fun though. Imagine all the lvl 1's corpse-running to the Arena straight out of their starting zone to have a go at the chest. STV will be mayhem right from the start :D
---
There's no point in having the potential of doing more damage if that potential can never be realised. At some point optimisation actually needs to take reality into consideration.
---
&gt; Vendor all skins
---
Eventually you'll find somebody paying 1g 20s (ish) for stacks of rugged and thick leather which is better than trade price. I ended up whispering and just agreeing that regardless of the price he was offering on trade I could just send CoD at 1g 20s. 
---
Reason being is LW can make items with the stack that sells for about 50s more than cost, so they spam trade and spend their time crafting and make easy money.
---
Thorium Brotherhood
---
For people who love the thrill of gambling it could be appealing.
---
Fucking laughable. Just the fact that Forsaken rogues exist, makes this laughable. This is coming from someone rolling Troll too.
---
Prot is pretty good for levelling with others. Consecration makes them great in low level dungeons, and they're good at keeping classes like warlocks and warriors going stronger for longer when questing.
---
If you have people, do it, otherwise probably just go ret.
---
I've never played one myself, but I believe the crippling issue for them is lack of taunt. Their aggro is decent, they just struggle getting it back if they lose it.
---
The right plan is to take skinning, not buying all the class spells &amp; skills unless you need them for leveling and not giving in to shopping sprees on the AH. 
---
You \*will\* have 90g at lvl 40 then.
---
I was a Nelf Huntard back in Vanilla days.
---
I want to try a Mage so Human Mage will be the first toon I level up to 60, but I'll definitely level up a Nelf Hunter to 60 as well.
---
Apart from leveling the mage first, still haven't decided which one will be my main.
---
Once a Huntard, always a Huntard.
---
&gt;should I follow my heart
---
Yes. 
---
Unless you're going to be a ret pally :p
---
Also on parry haste. This is only a 40% reduction of the swing timer for one attack. This sounds like much but it isn't. Bosses have 2.5 Swingtimer. So 1.5 after a parry in 60% of all parry (14%). On the other 40% it will have less impact. If the boss parry 0.3 seconds befor his next attack, the swingtimer will be decreased by only 0.3 seconds. So in most cases shieldblock will be finde even with 14% parry to ensure you won't get crit and crushed. Also keep in mind, thand thunderclap/TF slow down the attackspeed and dodges/parrys/misses do not consume an shieldblock stack. So this is really minor. Also parryhaste is disabled for the hardhitters (like lashlayer).
---
I don't necessarily agree with that. Different people have fun with different stuff. Personally, I enjoy the challenge of rushing to 60 and trying to clear MC asap more than I enjoy questing and making friends in the open world.
---
I will definitely level an alt through questing at one point, though.
---
The other 10% are Forsaken rogues that somehow have even less honor. 
---
Tauren and Trolls are cool. Orcs and Forsaken definitely get the kill on sight treatment, when I was ally
---
Sarah Connor agrees.
---
Looks great.
---
And then since they were struggling to find a healer and eventually just call it cause Classic.
---
Source: Guild raids that struggled to have 40 ppl online
---
Elem is a blast in PvP, a little less in PvE but if you're ok with running raid with a casual guild you shouldn't worry about finding a raid spot.
---
I don't really like enhance so I might not be objective about that but I think they are "good" in PvP if you know what you're doing and as for PvE they don't really shine but same goes for Elem so it's up to your playstyle preference.
---
I understand that you don't like to heal in raid, but if you want to be somewhat competitive and don't have to change spec every week, I would recommend an Elem/resto build so you can heal in raid when needed and dps on trash, easy bosses and content on farm but you'll need a guild understanding that you'll need on dps gear first and take the left-over healing piece.
---
Have you considered the fact that all of the Horde cities cause eye cancer and are trash piles?
---
I think most people prefer at more deterministic approach to loot distribution, then just getting better odds.
---
Communicate with them. If they refuse to, try to finish the dungeon(or look for replacements, this is painful though) if you can and blacklist them when you are done.
---
I have taken the same class, but going from human to undead, with the headcanon that my 8 year old self is reborn as something bigger, uglier but better. For The Horde!
---
I'm basically doing the same thing as back then.  
---
Undead warlock. Even though if a guild requires me to, I might roll an undead mage since I always wondered if the grass was greener on the other side.
---
I levelled a priest in TBC, healing dungeons in shadow spec.
---
It's a lot more exciting than holy spec, which makes healing too easy.
---
Since I played at launch of the original I am not actually going to play right away. Maybe a few weeks later. I don't need to be first, after all.
---
Im meaning that if u pull 3 mobs u cant leash one of them out from the other 2, if one resets they all do.
---
But then you send 3 hunter pets to attack the boss in the face (because pet ai's not very smart in vanilla) and because of the 14% parry the boss ends up parry hasted all the time :).
---
Obviously you can make the argument that this will never happen with good hunters, but it's hunters they have a reputation for a reason.
---
Basically this. Thank you very much for clarifying what my dumb ass sleepy brain didn't!
---
3rd or 4th best behind hunter and druid (and arguably Warlock), I'd say
---
Also mob respawning is staggered and they take longer to spawn compared to pservers. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdfrb4/21_reasons_why_aoe_farming_is_harder_in_classic/) is a video about AoE farming differences compared to pservers someone posted on reddit some time ago.
---
Undead is my personal favourite, lots of interesting stuff going on with the Scarlet Crusade.
---
As someone who only wants a tank for 5 mans, I was going to try paladin but I'm not a die hard prot paladin player so I feel like the extra effort to make it work isn't worth it over the others
---
I think it's a good questing area but the quests and story is bad. Only defias in Westfall is even a decent questline and that's just a few quests. 
---
Compare it to Undead where every quest has real lore.
---
I am not subscribing.
---
So if the release is between monday and tuesday. does that mean EU will have about 24 hours before weekly maintenance or will that just be skipped? anyone knows?
---
It works if you stand up at the moment of taking a hit, thanks to spell batching. It also makes it so much more tedious that I don't think it's worth it anyways.
---
Except you shouldnt be fighting high level mobs as a warrior considering they can take twice as long to kill with only a minimal increase to XP
---
It will work if you time it right, you can find proofs above in the thread. Still a pain and I highly advise against fury.
---
You rely a lot on the demon you happen to have out. Felhunters are detrimental to other casters while being pretty poor against melees apart of the stealth detection buff. Imp is pretty useless unless you cheese it with machinegun spec and black book. Voidwalkers are useful against any opponent because of the shield, but mostly against warriors because they don't get rage from attacks absorbed by your shield. The Succubus is great for CC and actually does hurt a bit especially if you specced into her.
---
That made me laugh, and is also why my warlock is not going to be a warlock.
---
Sure you can always find special circumstances. That´s why I said in 95%+ of all attacks you won't get crit or crushed. This "calculation" includes those hunters ;)
---
That's just not doable in classic. Not until you vastly outgear the content can you just does them all down.
---
You should reconsider; priest is my jam!
---
I ignored talents, because both classes have talents to improve their damage in the tree. Crit chance is pretty much a wash, likely even with a slight advantage to palas, because they will have higher crit chance. Both have 6% dmg from talents.
---
Also the main point is not about casters, it's jsut an illustration, that they can keep up with casters. It'S about other melees, a leveling ret will be better than warriors and combat rogues most of the time.
---
Wanted to play paladin... the druid.... now I am looking at hunter video’s pfff.
---
Played a Night elf hunter with only a bear throughout the entire game
---
Now playing most likely as a bear Druid, so instead of having a pet I’ll be my pet
---
I feel you. Been in a similar relationship myself. I actually find that a lot of girls on my age, do not have hobbies besides watching the same Netflix shows over and over again?
---
I'm not playing paladin again, but the original experience as paladin was 11/10.. loved it. Trying something different this time. Split between priest/hunter/mage
---
SM/Ruin and later NF/Conflag are extremely fun.
---
Where spell damage axe?
---
I am going for an undead priest.
---
I will be a casual and being a healer makes it easier to find groups
---
And by playing a cloth user, i wont risk hunters rolling on my gear /s
---
Yeah, you won't get crit or crushed but boss will be doing 40% more dmg.
---
Its a useful tool, and yeah I'd also prefer it to your system because its a guaranteed value that rewards good teamwork, whereas is there any point using a mulligan if Dave who only does one in every 5 raids has already won the lottery and rolled a 90?
---
With DKP you can encourage things like: On time to the raid +10DKP, staying for the full duration of the raid +20DKP. Where it gets messy is allowing discretionary bonuses if you really help out the guild. Running someone through BRD 5 times on an alt because a healer quit? Award the group DKP. It's a nice idea but then favouritism can creep in, and people with less time to play outside raids can feel disadvantaged. Personally I prefer clean cut predetermined bonuses, earned in raids only for equality.
---
Also goes the other way and can ensure your less reliable members either change their ways or leave. More than 5 mins late to raids? -10DKP. Late 3 times in a row? -20 more DKP.
---
Its a natural way of ensuring that the people who do more for the team, get rewarded for it, and those who waste time are discouraged.
---
One of the main failings of personal loot on retail is that, if you have the drops you need there is no reason to show up to help others, and there is no penalty for being late or going afk for a 20 minute poo mid raid whilst everyone is waiting. With DKP, just show up and get rewarded, bank it for later.
---
yeah, normal retail costs ~45eur to play. fuck paying that just to play for two weeks.
---
Nah. Crushing blows are some of the least of your problems as a raid tank. You don't have the staying power for fights that drag on. 
---
Maybe OT, yeah. You'll make a good trash mob collecter.
---
I had a lvl 40 priest on Northdale, so Im worried leveling will bore me to death. 😂
---
TBC isn't that different to Vanilla - just less QOL, less viable specs, less focused PVP (more about world pvp).
---
Warlock when played well is one of if not the best 1v1/1vX world PvP class. They suffer from lack of mobility but that can be countered with consumables.  
---
They have a lot of sustain and tankiness, and great burst in SM/Ruin or even better as NF/Conflag.
---
Sounds like we have mostly the same needs for addons - so I'll share with you my list with links to my picks for my wanted addons - in case you can use it.

The only thing I can is exclude classes from my possibilities. Im not going druid, rogue or warrior. Besides that Im screwed.
---
Study hard. Stay in school.
---
Selling enchantments, but instance of doing the enchant you run with the money.
---
Classic experience.
---
How do I cope with the most boring leveling?
---
That's a really good way to do it. Incredibly small release window.
---
Mmm Thats too bad then.
---
That’s a good thing imo
---
That would be the pink tallstrider ;-)
---
Seriously thinking about trying to get it as a dwarf, but Mulgore will be so overcrowded at first.
---
But imagine that... Me, the dwarf with a pink tallstrider AND the collector edition panda pet. On an RP PvE server. I will get so many laughs.
---
Probably just copy and paste from classic wow client. 
---
Classic Naxx time-walking raid when?
---
#TRIFLING GNOME! Your arrogance will be your undoing!
---
How is it different from Lich King?
---
Yo OP please make one for me too! lol
---
&gt; I don't really understand the whole "going back to old equipment
---
What monitor are you using atm?
---
why can I vaguely remember Summoning stones summoning people if you had 3 people at the stone, like a warlocks summon? Was that a BC thing?
---
Screech is an AoE effect, so you will be able to have your pet tank multiple mobs and multishot without getting agro.
---
YES.
---
Still better than your shitscreen bruh.
---
Priests are actually pretty decent level. With Spirit top you don't really run out of mana and you can just use your wand anyway. Not dying is a bonus and being desirable for five men content means you can run dungeons almost whenever you feel like it
---
If someone could update "Nice damage" that would be amazing
---
I can't help you I have the same problem
---
You could make a post on this subreddit about it, I found a post one of my old guildies made by searching for my guild name and server on Google, it was on the first page.
---
The fastest route is actually to stay in Darkshore until 19/20. So many guides make the mistake of sending you to Loch Modan at some point in there which slows you down a lot.
---
Minor amendment to 1-10 elwynn if rogue: dont bother doing the encrypted letter quest until after you've done the 12 burlap bandanas quest; you need to go there for milly osworth anyway and the only spell you can learn at lvl3 is stealth, which you dont need yet.
---
21-42 hours per week is huge.
---
That’s either a half-time or full-time job!
---
I’m surprised that over 50% are planning to play this much
---
The real question is why trolls can be priests. They don't follow the Light unlike undead which were human once.
---
Had the same conondrum a few months ago. If you are considering a Shadow Priest, just roll a Warlock and your life at 60 will be much easier. If you might want to play a healing Priest, ask yourself if you want to rely on others in BGs/open world content in the endgame.
---
I’m going with Warlock, but race also played a huge role in that decision, Dwarf is the only Priest race I like aesthetically, but I’m going Horde and Orcs look cool.
---
Tbh I haven’t really had a lot of issues with that even with fully raid geared dps you can hold Aggro in normal dungeons if you play it right (at least on private servers) this might be different in classic wow now but if you need to taunt then do it... Taunt is NOT a cd that you safe for rainy days.
---
More of a warrior-exclusive discussion, really, but I think, depending on your playstyle, Tauren can actually be pretty damn good for PVP.
---
The stun resist of orcs is obviously amazing, but getting an extra hit in here and there and having an extra stun at your disposal that also has a pretty nice range, feels pretty satisfying.
---
Think it's not as heavily orc-favoured any more to the point where you're straight gimping yourself, if you pick tauren, but considering orc also takes the cake for PVE and blood fury is great as well, I'd still give them the edge.
---
I'm so surprised this was left untouched... Made me laugh tho.
---
You pull it, you tank it is my philosophy. Especially when the healer is my friend, since he just won't heal them xD
---
Yeah they're decent in the sense that it's not hard and you can survive a shit ton. But they're slow and boring as hell.
---
Only third row right?
---
Maybe I'm just assuming my paladin friend knows what he's talking about when he doesn't lol :P
---
I'm with you. I wanna be there for the experience.
---
Which talent reduces threat?
---
The classic wow client doesn't even have AV how it originally was.
---
I think objects like that are on personal loot in classic - I've heard of people doing Relics of Wakening and being able to loot relics instantly no matter how many people were there in beta. And named mobs like Ferocitas should be on a 1 min respawn timer so they won't be hard to get.
---
[https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
I chose depending on my friend groups need!
---
There is none, the devs said that Forsaken are Shadow Priests by default, Holy is just an option for gameplay reasons.
---
Maybe they added some lore in the last 10 + years, but in Vanilla every Forsaken Priest is shadow (and the starter quests even highlight that, you are the other side of the coin)
---
Hilarious but this is a LEM.
---
The good news is that there are only seven days left until name reservations open, and two of those days are on the weekend. So the odds are 1 in 5 that we get a server name list today. Tomorrow they'll be 1 in 4.
---
Priest leveling is pretty fun if you like being efficient. Also it’s safer than Warlock if you roll on a PvP server in my experience.
---
You're talking about the game price (retail) which will be free for us. We'll only have to pay for game time, which is [at most](https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time) 12.99 euro per month or less if you buy more months in advanced. 
---
Still wouldn't pay 6.50 euro just for a name though 😋
---
&gt;Selling enchantments, but instance of doing the enchant you run with the money.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Classic experience.
---
WTF?
---
It sort of does. You asked about a "new go to"
---
Taurens have the same amount of extra range now that they always had. All classes get leeway, Taurens get extra base. If Taurens are a go to now (they're not) they would have always been.
---
I've read that questitems like the dreamcatcher or bingles tools had instant (or near-instant) respawn times in the beta, I really hope thats true and stays this way for release as otherwise the only slight chance of ever completing these quests in the first 2-3 weeks would be from layering and even then only for a small amount of players.
---
I don't think that's actually true I would say they're somewhere slightly above middle of the pack
---
Because unless you are horde you don’t take ambush while levelling. It’s needed for the horde poison quest and you only take rank 1. It’s more just simply better to level as combat.
---
Interesting, gonna check it out!
---
yes, I'm talking about the retail game price and I don't understand what's confusing about that. If you want to play classic you just buy game time, if you want to play retail like the person I was replying to suggested, you gotta buy the game as well. And I'm not buying it only to level up to 50 or whatever and chuck it two weeks later.
---
« what you seek is a speed-hit build which depends on items that directly increase damage not just strength but stuff such as the silithus ring. and those things can get insanely over powering in raids if you get a high enough speed. »
---
You literally made the claim that a « speed-hit build » is better than the rest. So I’m asking you to back that up with an actual description of said build, otherwise I’m not gonna believe you. Nothing to do with being too lazy to look things up, I’ve played with the best guilds and never seen any rogues with such builds so unless you provide proofs, I’m just gonna assume you don’t actually know what you’re talking about.
---
Have a thick skin. 
---
There'll definitely be people out there who expect tanks to have played the game for the last 15 years, when they join a group. If you can, I'd recommend doing your first dungeon run early, with friends and/or guildies and to be upfront about how it's your first time and if they have tips to help you out, you'd appreciate it.
---
So being humble and showing a willingness to improve is probably your best chance at minimizing whatever "backlash" people **might** give a fresh player.
---
I think the general idea is that Hunters are the “easiest” class bc they can be leveled quickly. Therefore = easy mode.
---
The skill ceiling for hunters is incredibly high so that’s incorrect imo
---
Write a pros and cons list for each. Then rank them in order of likelihood they're actually going to be a good match months from now.
---
Worked for me
---
would be ideal
---
The band Elwood!
---
Less than that too. It's a 40% reduction on the remainder of the swing timer for one attack. So if that boss parries you at 2.4 on the swing timer he will hit you at 2.46 seconds instead of 2.5.
---
What classes would you say are slower than priests in leveling? I haven't leveled a paladin or a shaman, so I can't say anything about those. But I think that all the other classes I played were faster than priest.
---
Hahaha, this used to be my opinion! But I've always found Mulgore to be lovely and I feel I can relate more to orgrimmar after having just replayed WC3+Frozen Throne.
---
But nothing will ever compare to Darnassus for me. Back in the day I refused to change my HS, so after a raid 39 guild members would end up in Ironforge and yours truly on the other side of the pond.
---
I played a spriest back in vanilla, cleaned every raids except Naxx, most guilds on my server had a spriest in their roster. You shouldn't have any problem
---
Study in School. Stay hard.
---
You think you're right, but you're wrong!
---
I honestly would rather stand with me face towards a wall, because that fucks with a rogue opener a lot more.
---
Rogues often CS -&gt; kidney -&gt; gouge -&gt; restealth -&gt; sap -&gt; wait for DR to wear off -&gt; CS again -&gt; weaken armor at some  point -&gt; blind -&gt; restealth -&gt; open up again -&gt; etc.
---
By standing on a ledge facing towards the abyss, you are taking out the gouge from the rotation forcing the rogue to actually DPS instead of keeping control by gouging and restealthing.
---
Alliance (Human side) has an overarching plot up until the mid 30s.
---
...except female dwarves

---
Oh ok, wasn't aware of this. So parryhaste is even less impactful
---
100% with you my friend. What the absolute fuck do I do?
---
Because they’re the most noob friendly and have a lot of new players playing them, hence they do stupid shit like accidentally pull with their pets, need on items they don’t actually need etc...
---
How else are they going to solo Azuregos( or the proper spelling of that) without that +healing gear
---
Just because nobody communicated in the level 43 dungeon you queued for doesn't mean people don't communicate in retail
---
Go lock.
---
dude - you've just deleted him!
---
Does the fact that the most recent private server has made all of the changes from the Beta and the main tank of the only guild completing raids is Fury-Prot change your mind?
---
14% is a completely insignificant change.
---
Or just pickup the mob and continue through the dungeon like normal? If the person taking threat isn't causing a wipe, then why have a fit? You let him die and are now wasting time for 3 other people that did nothing wrong. And at the end of your dungeon you can just put him on your own personal blacklist so you don't need to run dungeons with him in the future.
---
The whole "you pull it, you tank it" is the most toxic casual mindset I've seen from tanks. I've always thankfully ran in guild groups so i don't have to deal with it. But there can be reasons why a DPS pulls aggro in lvling dungeons. One example could be your sunder missed and the DPS player got a crit at the same time, this could cause a huge swing in aggro that was not intended. Another could be theres only 2 mobs left and pulling aggro isn't going to cause a wipe in the slightest, it will only speed up the dungeon so it's fine.
---
It's only a problem if the DPS doing it causes your group to wipe and even then you should just tell him what he is doing wrong, having him die just wastes time for the other 3 people in your group, so you're being inconsiderate just to have your own personal vengeance.
---
Yea, if they give retail the 1.0 version but classic 1.12 AV people are really going to kick off.
---
In terms of extra damage incoming on tanks, on average it has been theorycrafted as an extra 7-8% damage on average over private servers which isn't a big deal even for dual wield fury/prot tanks. The worst case scenario - the maximum amount of attacks in a short window hasn't changed from private servers, its just slightly more likely.
---
Threat will be 9-10% lower across the board, however the lower armor values (the highest armor on any boss in classic will be 3731) will mean tanks produce roughly the same threat overall, however the DPS will also do more damage to make up for that... In the end it will probably be about a 10% TPS loss relative to pservers. But its important to remember that if you have good tanks and half decent healers to keep them up in threat gear then the DPS will be rarely threat capped in vanilla raids, especially on alliance. I don't expect it to affect the DPS meta at all since this is a smaller difference than horde vs alliance and warriors are still top DPS on both factions.
---
The Discord link to get to #guild\_recruitment is not valid anymore!
---
Oh ive already read the threads about saving money on skills ^^ im looking for some actual answers on why its considered inefficient ?
---
Warriors are the slowest levelers unless you have somebody to funnel gear to you. You don't have any healing so you are constantly sitting down to eat.
---
Rogues are the same deal except you're able to skip mobs so they're a little bit faster.
---
Paladin's have high survivability and utility but Mana causes you to sit and drink all the time.
---
I haven't played a shaman so I can't really say but I imagine they're in a similar boat with paladins.
---
In my experience with the priest, because of spirit tap, and the wand dealing so much damage you can just keep going from Mob to mob. Put a power word Shield wand wand wand, gain a bunch of Mana back, throw in a mind blast, etc
---
The cock or the bike?
---
Yeah the LFG function was absolute dogshit. It just added everyone who queued without a care about their role. Got 4 Rogues in a group once.
---
Surely a warrior is slower to level than a priest, no?
---
I can't wrap my head around anyone thinking that say, a mage, is more complicated than a hunter. 
---
Atleast hunters dont just press 1 button.
---
Yeah I'm 99% sure I'm gonna end up doing the same, even though I guess it would be nice with something different
---
I am rolling a different faction and class.
---
Previously i mained hunter &gt; Druid &gt; Ele Shaman &gt; DK &gt; Ele Shaman. i also leveled most classes to 80 before stopping. all as alliance.
---
This time i am rolling a Undead priest.
---
He is still the record holder but largely by default since pirate servers aren't a good representation of the game and don't count in most peoples minds.
---
Pserver mages have better records.  Jokerd basically AoE mage'd his way to 60 way faster than Joana. Can't quite AoE as effectively on official servers though so we'll see.
---
Hunters are noob-friendly, so anyone introducing someone to WoW says "play a hunter it's easy!" and then these noobs make noob mistakes and give a bad reputation to the whole class.
---
Don't . Really. 
---
The community will be so toxic/ intolerant towards a new tank it would totally ruin the experience for him. People can forgive many terrible dps players and all the meme specs, but the expectations for tanks will be incredibly high.
---
On one side you have all Private server elitists who know everything and would expect perfect tanking, perfect gear and understanding of game mechanics.
---
On the other side you will have all the people coming from retail where tanks never lose aggro, so they will pull aggro as Aoeing mages die immediately and blame your brother.
---
Even if he's a relatively good gamer and learns things quickly, the community will crush him. But that's just my pessimistic opinion, it will definitely be easier if you play together, but even then you will run into know-it-all elitist dps all the time.
---
The wording makes it clear that it is identical to *initial* release. Which is 1.5
---
Goblin /s
---
Because those guilds only concern is min maxing.
---
I'm sinking of the scenario where the tank goes one way the DPS goes another and then you wipe the entire group because you decided to lead as a DPS. It is not your place as a DPS to pull them off unless the tank asks you. You want to talk about toxic Behavior it's doing something that is not your responsibility that can cause a white for the whole group
---
I can use some, but they're unsiginificant ones
---
Is that Blizard's words or MMO Champ? Kaivax just described it as "an old-school-inspired Alterac Valley battleground" [[link](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/8-2-5-ptr-development-notes/237019)]
---
Play with your alliance friends from the horde side. Ganking them.
---
same, but i'm looking forward to the nicer zones &amp; cities, and a different route to 60.  have played horde the last few times, but my first char was alliance so it will be nice to relive that a bit
---
I've got it narrowed down to hunter or rogue, the former of which was my main in vanilla. Should try something new, right?
---
But hot damn the hunter life is just calling me back..
---
Just pick a class and roll with it. If you chance your mind later, you'll have two characters to collect that juicy rested XP with. Alts with maxed professions are good for making money.
---
Actiblizz's biggest earner is Candy Crush.
---
Faction is truly decided by my friend group. Race comes down to lore. Which race do I like the most. I do not like trolls.
---
Hard study? School stay?
---
Are you aware of how many stuns that are actually in the game and commonly used? Yes, just because of 25% stun resist - which is actually 30% if you count the base stun resist that all classes have. Its a big deal.
---
Very, very hard, tbh. It depends really on which classes you want as alts. If you want a Warrior main with a Rogue and Paladin alt, you're gonna have an unpleasant surprise :P
---
Undead Male\*
---
I was originally thinking of rolling a shaman, but recently my mind and hype is towards my main from years of retail: priest and mainly shadow. I am going to melt faces. 
---
_wtb orc priests_
---
At 60 yeah, although pre-endgame you won't really be using HS so a point or two in imp Charge might be more impactful. 
---
The spec I'll be using while levelling has no points in HS, 2 in charge &amp; 1 lonely point in 2h wep. The *second* point in charge &amp; the  one point in 2h I'd say are just spare points for me though, so it doesn't matter all that much where you opt to put them. If you think you might PvP a fair bit, you could even put 2-3 points into imp hamstring although they're a waste in group PvE.
---
Ah my apologies you're correct.
---
I was in the same boat man, started WoW around the AQ event and never got to max level until TBC because I kept changing my mind.   
---
In the end I was able to max-level a rogue in TBC so I'm going to play rogue again in Classic. No distractions, no alts, 100% rogue no matter what anyone says hehe.   
---
Whatever you do, don't be me! Don't make 5+ alts and waste so much time leveling them up to 40 before giving up and changing classes over and over again.
---
Feral cat dps is the biggest meme ever and there will never be a spec that bad again.
---
Nice koala !
---
what i remember about hunters is bad pet control
---
Ive never been an altoholic. Usually plays on a single toon.
---
For extremely efficient farming classes like hunter/warlock this is definitely the case. If you aren't it can be tedious and negligible and feel particularly bad for newer players. What class do you play btw?
---
Oh yeah i wasn't defending the system, just throwing it out there.
---
Bear tank is legit.
---
I was about to post the same comment.
---
Priest is really fun to level! You get to use direct spells and dot spells, while also a fair amount of auto attack through wanding. This last part is important, as you can choose to be highly mobile during the fight, or just relax and let the auto attacks down the mob for you. 
---
This, in combination with mana and health management (how many direct spells can you cast in order to regen health and mana fast enough?) gives a level experience where you need to think a step ahead all the time.
---
Two very different classes. I would personally not play either, but the fact that youve played a hunter in vanilla already might be the edge for rogue!
---
Neither of those things is true.
---
They will get healing spots in raids to not waste gear drops.
---
Interesting. What warlock is your warlock going to warlock then?
---
I understand completely, thats why Im in such a dilemma!
---
Yeah I’m not denying it’s a great, if not the best PvP racial ability, but I don’t think that means they are better overall
---
You aren't going to do that AND do enough damage to kill them while not dying yourself.  Not against one that knows how to play.
---
Im doing a complete 180 Jumping to the Horde and Shaman to get the full experience.
---
Play what will be fun for you me and 4 other buddies all plan to run whatever specs we want I know it's literally worthless but I'm running a ret paly just for shits and gigs since we have two that want to be tank warriors were really just playing for pve grind to 60 anyway so high end content isn't on my to do list
---
Ive hit lvl 40 on vanilla as priest. It bored me to death man. But I got a feeling lvl 60 priest might be real fun!
---
For 5 mans easy way is to mark targets and tell people what to do, tank is generally the leader so if your confident in your knowledge of a dungeon dont be afraid to tell people what to do, as long as your friendly and confident people will usually listen, being friendly and communicating is the easiest way to get people to do what you want, because they'll know what you want, it might be a little slower, especially at the beginning but as people get used to your habits pretty quickly, and will appreciate runs where no one dies, its very easy to get friends to do runs with over and over when you never wipe
---
I have a week off from work and will be meeting some of my new guild mates at Gamescom before launch. I will do a big grocery haul on Monday and prepare some food for the first days (rice, chili, some greens and chicken). I won't be going full tryhard and try to get enough sleep and exercise in the mix. I will take my time, enjoy the questlines and will run every dungeon with a group of friends.
---
Koala...sulfuras.....why?
---
why dont all of you guys go to retail?
---
there you can damage meter, FOTM and minmax all day long.
---
not sure i want to meet these kind of people in classic.
---
Definitely, I've made a few rogues on private servers over the years and got them up to around 20, always thought that if real classic ever comes around that'll be me.
---
But now I'm just reminiscing on how sweet that hunter's life really was.
---
Not every fight worked exactly the same way. Heigan, Razouvious and 4HM come to mind (which you needed 8 geared tanks for). But i'm not sure they're different enough to warrant it's own TW. Lich King Naxx was basically just OG Naxx tuned for 10/25 people
---
Thinking about resto druid and frost mage as 2 mains, one on each faction.
---
The good thing is that if that does happen he can always just dps as warrior instead. Thank you for your input.
---
Resto Druid wouldn't be too bad if you levelled as Feral. Frost Mage wouldn't be too bad at all either :)
---
You can get a character to 40 in about 2 days played.
---
If you rush the characters to 40 then take advantage of the rested xp to level your alts might be reasonable.
---
Downside is you are playing the same content again back to back at the start.
---
Primed for a good time then!
---
Tried that. Either way I get disappointed
---
You'll have to try it and see. In TBC I had two mains, frost mage and a resto druid. I didn't get very far in the raiding scene with either of them because I was trying to gear them both at the same time and I simply didn't have time to do that. I was a school kid so I played everyday from school home time to about 9pm ish, so a good 4 or 5 hours a day, and it wasn't enough. I wasn't in a guild tho, so I had to pug almost every raid invite. Majority of my time would be spent spamming chat than actually raiding.
---
Stress test on August 8th
---
How big is the difference between pre-raid BiS and raid gear? Like, what's the gear gap I can still overcome with skill?
---
Hunter &gt;&gt;&gt; Druid &gt; Mage &gt; Warlock &gt; Shaman &gt; Priest &gt;&gt; Paladin &gt;&gt; Rogue &gt; Warrior
---
Id wish I knew for certain.
---
There are daily quests in Winterspring in 1.12
---
What do you mean?
---
If by this point Blizzard doesn't have the realm names, they are highly incompetent. Which they aren't. hence, they already have the realm names.
---
What other reason not to make them public?
---
It's not speculation at all.
---
There are a few reasons:
---
* You are kinda reliant on you opener, which is slower than just running up to the mob and bashing it with your swords
---
* You need to stand behind your targets for backstab, which is hard when you play alone
---
Both of these facts, make it slower, which is why it's not recommended for leveling. If you play on a PvP server and are interested in world PvP, it might be something to consider though.
---
Personally, I will be leveling as a dagger rogue because I am playing with a friend, who'll be rolling a druid.
---
*warrior*
---
druids are underestimated because of their bad performance in early patches, but I think they are more than capable in 1.12.1 and looking forward to proving it :-)  btw my main was warrior since vanilla till cata
---
Well im not saying that taurens arent great either, all I said was I think that orcs shine more most of the time. Obviously there can/will be situations where the extra melee range can win you a fight, but again I just think its really situational.
---
No there are three regions - NA, EU and Oceanic.
---
This seems more..appropriate.
---
I am kind of in the same boat. I played Warlock back in the day but I didn't really know what I was doing and just followed a friend around everywhere. Now I don't know if I want to play Warlock again and actually play it properly or pick something else. I am kind of leaning towards Paladin but a little concerned with how well it will play in raids.
---
Good answer, but its best to use your common sense when deciding what to do with items as you level, not just DE everything or vendor everything.
---
Good vendor price (weapons etc)? Easy, vendor it to fund your mount.
---
Useful to someone / in demand (i.e plate and mail at lvl 40), put on AH
---
Low vendor price, not in demand - DE on your bank alt. Save for enchants later.
---
lil zoomer can go back to fortnite and fuck off lol
---
You really dont make money with ench outside of DE and most of the high, high end like crusader are BoE. Youre almost always better off having a different prof than enchanting on your main as it’ll make you more money or have better utility
---
You are a very optimistic person.
---
Why do you consider it good?
---
Did you actually play during vanilla?   Are you looking to exactly recreate what you did back then?   It sounds to me like you did not. 
---
Creating one class does not mean you are beholden to it for the entire game.  I levelled a hunter to 47 in 2005 before switching to Priest and went to 60.   
---
It doesn't matter what you do, it's not a race, try out whatever you want.    I think a lot of people are overthinking this way too much, just chill and enjoy the awesome zones and music and if what you choose doesn't fit your playstyle, reroll something else and try it out.    
---
You don't have to have it all figured out 3 weeks before you can even start.
---
\^ Seems like a really selfish attitude
---
Technically, no, only NA, EU, and Oceanic though I do believe the NA realms will be split between english and spanish while EU will be English and two other european languages. No clue for Oceanic though I do hope they get a mandarin localization to spare aussies and kiwis from the chinese gold farming spam.
---
I thought it did come in phase 1...
---
I feel ya bro, have a /hug!
---
Just embrace the altoholism my dude
---
becuse 3 times, per hour somebody makes an post with the same title as you.  
---
Nobody hates hunters, but people on the forums starting to hate them, because of this.
---
Do you want to explain how?
---
but dont worry hunter is one of the strongest class in game
---
damn it I was planning to farm it day one :/
---
WLs aren‘t that good like everyone thinks. In a 1v1 duel they are good, but prep is a big factor. You need the right pet against different classes which isn’t possible in wpvp. Rogues can kill you during stunlocks where you can‘t even get one global off, even with a VW (if the rogue knows how to play).
---
Pandaria remains one of the most lovingly crafted continents in the game and for what it's worth Pandarens were great *for what they were* and Blizzard made them as good as anyone could.
---
The fact remains that they did but for very well into the Warcraft universe. I don't mind light hearted themes but Pandas were too cartoonish and it was clear blizz were trying to capitalize off Kung Fu Panda. You said yourself they were too goofy. 
---
As for draenei they could have been handled better but they're a good Warcraft race imo.
---
Probably because you could sabotage people by jumping into their wpvp fight.
---
Hunters have the most forgiving solo experience meaning any inexperienced player can pick one and make it to 60 without too much trouble. 
---
When it comes to dungeons and group play, hunters are strong but often times have trouble, not breaking CC, not pulling threat and not pulling additional adds with their pet. 
---
Hunters also have one of the widest weapon pools available and for the average player without knowing before hand, can use just about any mail/ leather/ cloth that drops in game
---
\- this leads to many unhappy party members experiences and memories of playing with hunters.
---
That's... the complete opposite of what they said. They said they continuously came back to work on the human starting zones throughout the entirety of development because they were there first zones and were still special to them. And that they felt they were the most polished because of that.
---
I heard that you should do certain quests before Level 60 (like in Searing Gorge). Is there a resource to view these specific quests? Like a guide or something?
---
Hard to find any tank*  The good ones don't usually pug so be nice to the bad ones.
---
Sometimes a tank really does go way too slow (which usually means they're learning, dps pulling just gets in the way of that) but 9/10 times it's just "gogogo" whiners.
---
True, true,
---
Also MORE than 10 years
---
I‘am not going to play a mage in classic, I played mage enough and I find mage one of the easiest classes to play. Easy, Op and now too boring for me.
---
I think we have different definitions of high skillcap.
---
For me a high skillcap means that a perfect played character makes a big difference to a medium/good played character. Not just having some abilities, because there are classes with a lot more abilities.
---
There isnt a lot to think about mage, its pretty straight forward. you can do so many mistakes and even reset the whole fight. 
---
A class taht allows you to play bad and still win by alot is for me not a high skillcap class
---
lol. good answer :)
---
no taste in women
---
Are you interested in PvE or PvP?
---
I love mages for PvP but the boring PvE made me not choose them, instead I choose a healer
---
You’re incorrect. Base game is free with sub and has been for some time now.
---
Lich King naxx was tuned down to make it more accessible. In vanilla naxx you needed the best gear, best people it was the final raid. Some bosses were dumbed down because the damage things deal was less. In vanilla you needed 8 tanks with very good gear for 4hm and in lich King you could let an arms warr in pvp gear tank it
---
Feral just needs to be extremely committed. I'm yet to see a good balance druid but they might exist.
---
It is good if doing pvp while leveling is important, but not good if you are racing to level 60 while wearing pserver goggles.
---
we did it a ton in SM. even did non-imp sap with poly pulls.
---
Nice, I'll stick around.  Hope it grows.
---
Thex the rogue just isn't the same :/
---
LEM?
---
save your money, don't buy shit u don't need including spells
---
oops, still amazing
---
ya
---
I mean they said a month ago they're not done. But I think it's more about 'Which name do we use for which server in which region'
---
Yes this one is way better.
---
&gt; With Warrior, you're going to have to memorize 3 different hot bars no matter what.
---
[a video was posted a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccb0sd/warrior_action_bars_and_how_to_organize_them/) talking about warrior hotbar setups. his preferred method was to keep each stance bar the same, to (among other reasons) better track cooldowns. do you use addons to track cooldowns?
---
thanks for the breakdowns btw, they are great!
---
* PVP melee hit cap is 5%. 
---
* Weapon skill should give you 0.04% increase crit chance per point in pvp. It does not increase your chance to hit in pvp. 
---
* Also, IIRC, the attack table rolls from 1-10000 so "hit rating only function in whole values" seems to be incorrect.
---
I solved this dilemma by just playing what I played in vanilla
---
When classic was announced I knew I was going to make a shaman. 2 handed enhancement was the most fun I’d had ever in the game. But then I remembered my hunter and different pets actually meant something. Having The Rake and his fast attack speed. Doing the Echeyakee quest twice so you could tame it then abandon and complete the quest. But then my rogue...weapon specialization. Sword combat was a blast.
---
Wanting to hide Classic launch from people you deem tourists so as not to impede on your all important launch day experience seems selfish to me.
---
Sadly most of this sub wont know who any of those players are.
---
Honestly as a WoW player and like fantasy world geek .. I totally don’t see why it’s hated either!!
---
Like it’s full of War and Craft so I mean what’s there not to like, but I can see how it may have been slightlyyyy confusing for others.
---
Like my dad was watching it and was so confused while I was just geeking out.
---
Okay take for instance the dark portal scene in the beginning with all the dranei in the cages and stuff. My dad just sat there and went “what’s wrong with the blue people why are they in cages” and I was like ... oh here I go ... *pause movie* 
---
But that’s kinda expected when you’re making a game ona video game that’s lasted for yearzzzzz
---
Mannnn I just wanna see Arthas on the big screen
---
Velocity is changing. For acceleration to change gravity would have to change.
---
not true, you could easily kite chain with cooldowns and shatters, I had pvp-blue and some epics, while levleing you can't do 5 mobs but you can kill 1 or 2, maybe handle 3 on lvl.
---
I just want to tell you good luck, We're all counting on you.
---
Druid. I haven't tried it on a slower class like warrior, you might be right.

Orpheuz is a guild created by people who miss the current social part of WoW, but want to play competitively. We as a group didn’t make/join this guild to hit world first or be the most well-known, but aren’t the guys who don’t mind you not showing up for a singed raid night. We like to see ourselves as players with the competitive mindset but who do want to achieve their goals with friends where they can have a laugh with.
---
\*\*What we are looking for:\*\* 
---
\- Competitive players who want to grow in the game 
---
\- Players who are actively playing the game 
---
\- Players who fluently speak English (Decent microphone is req.) 
---
\- Players with a mature attitude in both a social and raiding environment 
---
\- Being able to take and give critique 
---
\- We are NOT looking for people who are afraid to talk. 
---
\*\*Loot Distribution:\*\*
---
We will be using DKP

So you think you are a person who likes to have a connection with guildies and play with them to reach great achievements? Then Orpheuz might be the place for you! Send me a private message and lets have a chat! If you have any question don’t be afraid to ask.
---
Well I can explain.  Because people care about their name and don't consider $15 a lot of money.  Hope this helps.
---
Why do you think casual guilds do that?
---
I have no fucking clue who these people are supposed to be, but the bit where the girl hits the baby off is fucking gold.\*
---
\*assuming the baby was fine, obvs.
---
If DPS is pulling, it's in 90% of cases because the tank is pulling too slow.
---
In my experience the biggest issue with this is dps-players without tanking experience since they sometimes doesn't understand why you're waiting to start pulling. For example the healer might be oom or their might be a pack patrolling nearby. There's usually a reason when your tank doesn't pull directly.
---
Fire. Stone. Warlock.
---
Bind some of the side buttons to modifier keys (e.g. shift, alt, ctrl, per your own preferences). That essentially just frees up a hand (slightly) from having to hold crazy button combinations.
---
Macro's (in the sense of what you can do on a mouse) are very different to the macro functionality you'll get from the game client. Don't mix the two up. The macro you'd set up on the mouse side-of-things leans towards automation (and how comfortable you are about that is strictly up to you).
---
Once you have played warrior on vanilla there really isn't any other class that comes close to being fun. This is from someone who has tried playing every class on the private servers to try to not burn out and it always ends the same. With me leveling a warrior and maining that.

Hungry for More is recruiting players of all classes and roles to bolster our raid team.
---
**About Us:**
---
We are a PVE guild, but you will find plenty of PVP -players in the roster, pushing for ranks between the raids. We have a strong core that has cleared all vanilla content in a “blizzlike” private server, we also ran regular pugs that cleared MC &amp; BWL. Even if we are established guild, we value attitude over previous experience. 
---
**What we offer:**
---
At Hungry for More we offer not only a great social experience during your time on Classic, but also a home where you can feel comfortable while raiding. We take pride in our quick and efficient clears and push ourselves to be better. We will keep things interesting with speedruns, but not overdo it every week to keep consumable consumption reasonable. Our officers are all seasoned players, and know their classes and will help you to push your characters to their limit.
---
**What we expect:**
---
A good attitude and high level of focus are required for all of our raids. We are highly organized and expect our raiders to be as well. We expect you to meet our requirements for consumables and world buffs. You can always find an updated list for what to bring in your respective class forum. We also expect you to have a proper spec with proper talents. This is to keep our raids smooth and efficient. We value positive competition among our players with drama free environment.

I know it's possible, but taunt can miss or resist or whatever. CC pulling works but it is not ideal and it should be perfectly possible to learn how to CC after pulls in any pull (doing 'roic TBC 5 mans it was).
---
Glad to see I’m not the only second generation player here. I was 5 when I watched my dad play on the Alpha Test. I remember one day I got home from school and watched my dad chat with 39 other people running Molten Core. I’ll never forget it.
---
No that's paladin
---
Awesome to hear man, the hype is real! The buddies i first played with in vanilla are also joining in, and out new friends are ready to check this ''classic'' thing out haha. Its gonna be crazy!!
---
...until level 7, then you realize you could have sw:pain, rinse repeat
---
The thought behind it was that the base dmg of ambush is high and with a guaranteed crit (like 85% minimum) it would quickly set up to a finishing evisc, and im just not quite buying into the “ if the creep is stunned (CS) it cant damage you so less downtime” argument as dead creeps cant dmg either. And also the fight for dagger-loot seems to be less?
---
Overall its just a matter of how i like My rogue to feel ^^ sneaking, pickpocketing and jizzing to a massive crit is My jam, its an rpg after all ^^
---
Corbantis unfortunately, land of the toxic, home of the doxxers.
---
Well, that's not what I said or what I want
---
I'm not saying Blizzard should take anything *away* from anyone, or *prevent* anyone from playing on launch.
---
I'm saying that for a smooth launch, it is essential that relatively few people login. This way, we avoid too much layering or login queues. This is a fact.
---
It's not "selfish" to suggest they be smart about this launch and wait a few weeks until they promote the shit out of Classic
---
Do you realize that EVERYONE gets a bad experience if millions login on launch day?
---
Pretty big assumption that everyone can get on during the weekend.  I don’t game whatsoever during the weekend as it’s dedicated family time.  I’m sure I’m not alone.
---
Based on what you got as a setup. In the beginning it's more Single Target so marking the Target should be fine. If you have AOE DPS you just want to use everything aggro related on multiple targets.
---
1 Target is already aggro, 2nd can be taunted, 3rd can get the taunting blow, 4th can get sunder stacks.
---
If you pull more you probably die ayways or have a good plan.
---
Not sure if there is any instance where not knowing who WoW players are is "Sad". May be the opposite actually.
---
Pulling mobs is not the same as pulling aggro. In the first case I am all for letting the muppet die in the second you just taunt it back if you can. If they keep pulling aggro then a quiet whisper to wait a little longer to start dps.
---
5% in pvp for melee.
---
Priest isn't bad at all. Just focus on getting the BiS wand for your level and it's a breeze.
---
If you think going OOM 15 seconds into a fight is fun go ahead, the only thing stopping you is the people who would rather not boost an ele through a raid.
---
When I first played WoW I was a Tauren Shaman but I goosed up the class so badly with constant respecs and gear changes and then when me and friends jumped ship from Spinebreaker EU to a new server I went an Orc Rogue instead.
---
With Classic WoW I'm planning on giving Shaman a proper run this time.  I enjoy playing healers more these days so I've no issue being the chain heal totem bot in raids.
---
It was tuned much tighter mostly.
---
It's minor compared to what you can do with 1000g, i prefer the mount personally, but I plan to have the mount and PRBis, especially if having a few more pieces of gear can get you more points towards loot.
---
&gt; A 25% increase isn't minor. 
---
If I ride for 60 seconds it only takes you 48 seconds, wooohooo.
---
what does kek mean from the 4chan point of view? I don't frequent that place
---
you don't have to kite, you target a mob and press frostbolt until it dies
---
Maybe this is them testing original AV and depending on how it goes will inform them whether they want to implement the old version in classic.
---
Since dungeon xp has proven to be very effective I don't have doubts that the record will be broken. You will basically see groups that have planned to go all out doing insane hours the first couple of days.
---
What add-ons showing the class colors here?
---
dude i've changed my job to part-time(from 8:00 until 13:00) instead full-time(told them i was tired lmao and later would change back to FT, YEA RIGHT AFTER RANK 14 LOL), have asked for 3 weeks of vacation starting at 27 august, bought wallpaper engine on PC so i can see the login screen of classic wow with login music every time i turn on my PC... my cousin said i'm starting to get nuts about this game, and i feel great about it
---
I haven't seen it mentioned yet but i'd say world boss fights.
---
ofc in classic you won't just fly up in the air playing chicken with the other faction on your mount. Its honestly pretty boring because you can't actually DO anything to them if they just all fly around and wait, unless you severely outnumber the enemy and can do the boss and fend off the PVP.
---
Plus world bosses have far better loot in classic IMO where as in TBC they were seen more as a luxury *(they did have great loot for some classes, but world bosses in vanilla take it quite a bit farther imo)*
---
[Read this](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/16200990425) most of it should still apply in classic. The rest is just you understanding what you want to jig-saw together.
---
Yeah I know :p
---
Maybe that's even a good thing, as we don't know what servers will be dead a few months after launch. Obviously some will have it better than others.
---
Yep.
---
Well the true mage leveling is done by some grinding which is not easy.
---
Not true, there are a lot of memes and such you could learn and players from the private servers. There was a lot of fun times that were had on the privates.
---
Hopefully one day he will forgive me.
---
Looks nice, will check this out as we get closer!
---
That seems to be the case. Humans are in the running as well.
---
That is the majority. Now to figure out what class lol
---
Why? The vast majority of Classic is based on the 1.12 patch. But then again, people don't always react logically.
---
My hesitation would be the high amount of PvP in Shimmering Flats.
---
But being able to turn into a cat IS cool
---
51 here, started table top rpg in 1984 with D&amp;D. Wow in 2005 allowed me to find again rpg with other players even if it was on a computer.
---
I think i will play my UD warlock again like in 2005. 
---
For the datas i quitted wow at wolkt, the good Times were gone.
---
Greeting from France
---
You think phase 1 will last 5 or 6 months?
---
Go warlock. You wont regret it.
---
I'm not saying you always fight higher leveled mobs, but sometimes you fight an orange mob for a quest etc.
---
Just a tip bro
---
Back in the day there would just be a large concentration of people playing Hunter but being extremely bad at it. No pet control, very low dmg. They also seemed to be the type of class that attracted shut-in types that would fuck everyone else over.

   * Hakkar 5100 DPS
---
   * Gahz’ranka 3500 DPS
---
   * Golemagg 3400 DPS
---
* Speed-running: MC (&lt;30mins), BWL (&lt;60mins), AQ40 (&lt;60mins), Naxx (&lt;90mins)
---
* Many ex-Rank 14 PvPers, both from Retail and Private Servers
---
* 6 months of World Boss Monopoly at one of the largest private server and its successor.
---
* Ragnaros defeat within 13 days of a new PS release (which is a goal we aim to improve. This time within the first reset of retail vanilla)
---
We put a high emphasis on improving boss tactics, theorycrafting and finding the optimal raid setup. Hubris has a subsidization policy, which involve the guild bank providing members with a part of the cost. For instance members can trade a flask for the mats except the \[Black Lotus\].
---
To keep raiding from getting stale (outside of the world #1 kill races) we usually try to spice it up with speedruns, speed kills, and going for top ranks on individual DPS logs. This is a great way to keep content exciting and fun while waiting for the next patch update.
---
# 💠 **World bosses:** 💠
---
One of the most exhilarating and rewarding events of vanilla is by far contesting World Bosses. Ginormous PvP battles, mixed with great boss fights and top-notch loot and gear.
---
The GM of Hubris was one of the raid leaders and a founding member of the world boss alliance at a private server that starts with N and another that starts with A. Where we at one point in time had a monopoly on all the world bosses and their loot for close to 6 consecutive months.
---
There is a great competition killing the world bosses, and it’s hard to act alone as a guild. This is why we have made strategic alliances with other guilds for a higher chance of defeating our good friends Kazzak, Azuregos, Taerar, Ysondre, Lethon &amp; Emeriss.
---
# 💠 **PvP:** 💠
---
Most of our members aim to achieve R10 or higher, without being a part of the Ranking PvP Squad. At the moment our Ranking PvP Squad counts 18 people who will be going for R12 or higher, where 8 of them will be going all the way to R14.  
---
In **Phase 2** we will be organizing honor farming groups every day to ensure our PvP Squad’s honor farm and control of the brackets.  
---
In **Phase 3** we plan on becoming the strongest horde premade on the server, and by doing that: gaining control of the servers brackets. We do believe this is highly achievable based on our previous PvP experience and skill, in combination with having the best gear from PvE content.
---
# 💠 **Additional Information:** 💠
---
Vanilla is finally back, and we’re hardly able to keep it in our pants. We hopefully piqued your interest in some way and are looking forward to seeing you join the ranks of Hubris.
---
You really don’t need to be a hardcore player to be a vital part of the guild. You are just as welcome to join us as a social member; rake in the benefits of being in a great guild, without any of the pressure.
---
Hubris will run weekly PUG raids where socials and alts will have priority spots, they will aim to consistently clear all content in progressing phases.
---
The raids will be organized by Hubris officer Yonomori, through his [discord](https://discord.gg/SZUk4gH). You can find more information about the PUG:s and its requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNQ0lJpXeAnIeCllsBY8rt4ItKF8IvFDCQ_O1VnZlhs/edit?usp=sharing).
---
We are currently looking for one additional member of the following classes for our Hard Core Raiding Squad:
---
* 2 Mages (Troll race)
---
* 2 Rogues
---
* 1 Priest (PI or Holy spec)
---
* 2 Shamans (Resto for PvE, Ele for PvP Ranking)
---
Even if we are full on a certain class/spec ***all exceptional applications will be considered.*** 
---
We're also recruiting exceptional players for our PvP Ranking Squad!
---
Thank you for reading. It’s important for us to find the right people that fit within our group. Some would say we are setting the bar too high, but you got to have a little hubris to achieve your goals.

Well yeah, don't get me wrong, it's still a good leveling strategy. I'm just pointing out that it's not going to be as good as it was on private servers.
---
You mean class icons? If yes its ClassPortraitsVanilla https://github.com/Ko0z/ClassPortraits_Vanilla
---
That is good to know I will note that.
---
Indeed, very very lucky. Drop chance is like 1/1000.
---
Tbh I hope the whole hit cap thing just gets stickied on this subreddit or something. At this point we have confirmation from Blizzard that it is 9% hit in general, and 6% hit with +5 weapon skill, but people are still like "well nobody knows for sure"
---
The difference between dungeon loot and raid loot is vast (especially BWL and on), and not something easily overcome with skill.
---
The only way to get high end gear is to raid, so realistically you'd have to raid on every character that you want to prog on.

**&lt;Cyrus&gt; | EU | Alliance | PvP**  
---
**Introduction**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. You can read more about our history at the link below:  
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)  
---
Following something of a general lull in the MMO scene over recent years, we are now beyond hyped to be turning the clocks back and recapturing our wasted youths in World of Warcraft Classic. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!  
---
**Raid Schedule (UK Times)**  
---
Sunday – 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Wednesday - 7.20pm to 11pm  
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress  
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.  
---
**Member Expectations**  
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.  
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.

If you played vanilla or on a private server, listen well and perform in raids, don't have all the time in the world but are able to still adequately prepare for raids and want to raid from MC to Naxx with a great group of non-toxic people, Omega is for you
---
Both quests have parts in dire maul, which wont be there until phase 2.
---
Maybe it was 3/4. I was around level 18 or so and he was like 20. You don't need to believe me but point is I got paid back to walk to darkshire and it was just advice for OP :)
---
Walking into redridge the first time and crossing the pvp zone to the town is still one of my favorite memories. Shadowmeld and swimming... good times.
---
I'd just say, dont roll because you want to be top DPS but try and see what you would like to play, contrary to the current classes in vanilla they are quite different in playstyle as well as in requirements for gear, specs etc. and you need to make sure you like it.
---
I will only be an asshole to my opposing faction.
---
Fuck you.

Don't be a toxic ass hole

IDK, I think it's pretty satisfying to level as priest. Heals, shield and fear to keep your alive. Make sure to keep Spirit Tap up and  your wand updated and you're good. Also, you are always invited to dungeons.
---
Thank you! Is this generally why I keep 2h reading slow weapon speeds are better for warriors?
---
Yep, that was my experience as well
---
No, the numbers were a lot different.
---
A lot of people have the same misconception as you, mainly because that one youtube video states how things like the Anub dot ticks roughly the same amount in both versions.
---
On live, there are Latin servers. Just a handful.
---
Username checks out
---
So the quests listed, are these the preferred ones for getting gear as well? Or just leveling?
---
I don't think I care ebough to be using a /sit macro. Sound such a hassle and something I cba to be doing anyway.
---
People change and everyone has bad days
---
I'll be toxic to alliance, with my rogue. :)
---
I think it really depends what you like doing! If you like being a healer then priest. Pet classes warlock. There are little things you will love about each class. For me, I loved Mind Vision as priest for seeing where Flag Carriers were in Warsong Gulch. Both are great classes but at 60 in raids you will be healing as priest. Hope this helps a bit!
---
Is that 2 cent or 2 copper? This a WoW subreddit after all.
---
Lol
---
Those are enchants named "Glyph of x/y/z"

We will see who is right in about 25 days.

Make sure the directories in the first three lines are as per your requirements.
---
Just copy/paste the code into PowerShell ISE
---
Well thats all I'm asking for really.
---
It probably is, because its so time consuming - BRD is huge and doesnt offer loot for everyone.
---
But aside from the obvious things like Ironfoe, Hand of Justice and Force of Will, there are some really good items like "Second Wind","Naglering", "Shalehusk Boots", "Grizzle's Skinner" or the "Barman Shanker". Also several pieces of high level resistance gear.
---
Same.
---
And don't forget, the funnest classes will be played by everyone and their mums, so you will NEVER EVER get instance spots.
---
Of course no worries, it is just one of the more frequent, but it is ok, still better than "Go ahead and play what you want!" "This game is about making your own journey!" and "You will(/not) be able to play as a meme spec.
---
Healthy message of course, nothing wrong with that, just.. yea
---
hi um can you share that please
---
thanks
---
I will be maining Prot Paladin,  
---
My Leveling build will be,  
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505031-053241330001541-05](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505031-053241330001541-05)   
---
My build order will be a little kinky though, and not normal.  
---
Prot until lvl 32-34 for 5/5 Reckoning,  
---
Then holy until consecration (means i get it around lvl 43-45), i don't like to use consecration until i get Seal of Wisdom, else you turn into one of those tank thats always drinking, this also give you time to practice not relying on consecration for agro.  
---
Divine Strength it better than divine intellect and spiritual focus allows me to solo better the imp SoR as i can chain pull and heal as needed.  
---
 Then i go back prot till holy shield, then back to holy for increased healing, then finish off with 5 in ret.  
---
I keep this build at 60, throughout pre-raid BIS gathering as it allows me to heal, and to tank well. Reckoning and redoubt can proc regularly as i don't stack too much defence.  
---
Then when it comes to raiding i will do one of two things,  
---
1. Try to get an off-tank raiding spot - in which case ill go with a spec like this -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/500501-053050335001051-05004](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/500501-053050335001051-05004)   
---
2. Try to get a 3rd or 4th tanking raiding spot where i heal more than tank -  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/500531105-053050335001051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/500531105-053050335001051)   
---
PvP wise its a mixed bag, warriors rogues and hunters are generally ok to deal with.  
---
For everything else theres a reckbomb burst or turtle up and try to run to safety.  
---
I highly recommend lvlings with friends as prot paladin as the support nature of the class makes it so much better.
---
Some people here can be toxic, yes. Hopefully they change
---
It was mainly because WOTLK Naxx was extremely underwhelming raiding after coming from BT/SWP
---
Well good? Is that relevant here?
---
Oh btw.. is barrens chatting considered being toxic? I saw a few people refer to barrens chat being toxic so..
---
Unfortunately we will all run into these type of people when we start playing this game and the best thing we can do is just ignore them carry on with our day.
---
Classic is sweet but idk if I’ll able to run dungeons for a few hours- makes me sad. 
---
I’m about this close to letting the wife and kids fend for themselves and get a divorce just so I can relive my
---
Nostalgia of no job/ no life and play until my balls are glued to my chair enabling me to play more because I have no money to get the surgery required to cut my
---
🥜 from said chair and continue to play until my skin has become one with the chair. 
---
Eventually I’ll just osmosis into my computer and live happily ever after.
---
You are alliance, yes? :)
---
60 priest is the shizz!! I loved maining 60 Priest, both for 5 mans, and raids. Being a priest, you always feel very valued for your role in a group/raid, which I found super satisfying, well, at least if you heal -- didn't play shadow much. And you only have to level a priest once. You spend 1-2 months (let's say) leveling the priest, and then you get to enjoy the F out of it for 1-2 years (let's say), not a bad deal in my book...! And, there's also no class that's a "dream" to level.... well they say hunter, but leveling is ultimately a grind of sorts (with some fun, of course...!). But still, I'm looking forward to it, and it makes end-game content that much more rewarding (including not being bothered by lower level players, and lower level zones/NPCs).
---
Like you said, I do think lvl 60 priest is totally worth it, big time, IMO (again, if you like being the main healer in raids/parties...!).
---
Don't know about a best way to set it up. I'm a lazy dude - I just set twelve hard-to-reach keys (usually right-hand ones) to the 12-button block, then I set one action bar in a way where it mirrors the button layout on the mouse (4x3), and bind the buttons accordingly.
---
With warriors, I usually bind the stances to the first row, shouts/utility on the second and third, and mount as well as as other situational stuff that's nice to have handy on row 4.
---
I like to arrange skills so they make sense to me: I cluster heals together, damaging spells, utility, oh-shit-buttons etc. As such, with a mage, I would conceivably bind the various damage shields and damage prevention abilities to the G600's 12-button-block, and maybe blink, as a Gnome Escape Artist, FAPs, that sort of thing. So I'd have my "damage" in my left hand, and my "defense" in my right hand (which is why I don't put damage skills on my warrior's mouse buttons either).
---
It's 0.03% in vanilla so it's around 1 in 3333~
---
It’s doable for sure.  I had two ‘mains’ geared the way you’re describing during retail vanilla and didn’t play an absurd amount by any means.  Even stopped playing completely for several months at a time on a couple of different occasions.  If you’re looking to keep 2+ chars in current raid gear then the discussion changes and you’d have to be putting a lot of time.
---
this macro should help
---
/use Piercing howl   
---
/yell HEEEELP
---
So great to hear people felt like the exact same way as I did when I started D:
---
Upon further research I believe the fastest on a private server was jokerd on lights hope at launch which was 2 days 17 hours. I’m pretty sure there’s a vod of some of it on his twitch.
---
Law Enforcement Moment
---
Ah, yeah. You have to play with your friends, though. Maybe next time. :)
---
I'm stuck because my friends want to do horde and my wife wants to do alliance...
---
YES! This, so muchhhhh! Wish my dad played wow I would have defintely been doing this LMAO
---
Excetions apply if you're a rogue or warlock, in which circumstances I'll be disappointed if you're \*not\* an asshole. Never trust a polite rogue.
---
Except that this is Classic, not Wotlk where a shield actually significantly reduced incoming damage and you would be one shot without one. 
---

---
A tank in maximum threat gear DW with Death Wish up takes damage equivalent to a tank in full T1 gear, and as long as you are using consumables healers will have no problem keeping you up.
---
thanks Bro!
---
I for one am glad they will all be in one place! Away from here!
---
sorry that was my interpretation of your previous reply. I'm just poking fun at your stance on launch day
---
Yeah same here. I get really invested in my main.
---
Meanwhile I wonder if I should play at because I've got no real-life friends to play with me and still want to hang out with them.
---
Any updates concerning any of these?
---
I said they were shoulder and head enchants that were named glyphs. I never argued they were the same as wotlk glyphs. That's your assumption
---
Is it just Darud - Sandstorm on repeat?  I never got into Techno, but it always seemed like the Techno guys just had that song a repeat in the early 2000’s.
---
Shit yeah!!! Soon enough you became that guy to people!!! Best feeling aint it? I remember when I got my friends into wow..they were getting ganked. I was the first one they called, hopped on my rogue and completely wiped them out. Ended up starting a war in the middle of nagrand had to call in 6 of my guild mates LMAO
---
I dunno, having a backup plan helps, in my books. I'm set on Shaman (wasn't sure between between Warlock and Shaman, but it progressively became clearer that I'll go for Shaman), but I feel like I have a solid Plan B if things go awry with Shaman, and/or if I feel like leveling an alt come 60 with the shammie. Of course I can't know 100% for sure that going Shammy is right, as I've never played it, but I'm willing to take the risk, especially knowing I won't mind rerolling into something else... :)
---
Keep calm and carry on!
---
When you play alone, at night with the music on in this game....it's so hard to stop!!!
---
Stealing this for when I level a warrior
---
Runrunrun anyone?
---
This is me. Had no idea what I got myself into when I rolled my dwarf paladin.
---
It's not that hard. Warlocks are in high demand because of their healthstones,soulstones and summoning portal. Also curses for every situation imaginable
---
I really appreciate this write up. Thank you. I'm very excited to try out tanking
---
Honestly - did you think about Mage yet? Mages are the best!!11!1!
---
Dude this story gave me the chills!  I love a good world PvP bout!
---
That is logical albeit nonsensical.
---
I'm pretty sick of all these posts implying that because we are classic enthusiasts, that we need constant reminders not to be toxic (assholes).  Drop the overuse of the word "toxic" and use "asshole" instead.  Yes people are asshole everywhere you go, especially on the internet -that's nothing new - and certainly nothing specific to this sub.
---
[1.To](https://1.To) even comepte for world first 60 on classic your /played on kronos 1 has to be 80h.
---
2.Private servers have much more harder mobs to kill then classic mobs - this will be reason why people will have like 70h /played on lcassic. ex. on any priavate server you can farm elite mobs - on classic you can anyhting which is elite. On classic you can outrun mob to shoot with range again as hunter on any priavte server was this possible(this is utlra strong for lvling).
---
3.Kronos 1 (private server) counts from perspectiv of mobs being hard,mobs giving proper xp,quests giving proper xp.
---
4.Classic is very bad representation of vanilla - the amount of gameplay changes is to much to be saying that blizzard is doing proper vanilla server.
---
5.Becuase you can very hard exploit layring to help the lvling xp.If you dont do it you can forget about world 1st.
---
Noooo....  
---
No more shaman.... no more meme spec and horrible water and wind totem Quest.  
---
The Warrior life chose me now.  
---
Ima be a Tank
---
This is just what I have been looking for, I'm too lazy to make one so thank you for making it!
---
hey i sympathise i was god-awful at making money in vanilla, but it robs you of the satisfaction if you just get handed money for repeating dailies imo
---
From everything I’ve read the search function requires internet. It doesn’t work stored locally.
---
LK was such a good expansion. Was the first expansion I raided current content and got geared! On several toons. In a raiding guild with raid times during the week. Having that structure and being a valuable part of a guild was so nice!
---
Here before this thread also becomes a guessing game where people throw out random numbers and say it’s the “most likely scenario”.
---
Hopefully the majority of people will be nice and helpful, I know I will be.
---
That's an oversight, added to my todo list.
---
Ya, it's absolutely OP just like the cleric class in dnd

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a large guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**How to join?**
---
Join our discord and i will reach out to you: https://discord.gg/STNp9aM
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!
---

---
I just made that up, i have absolutely no idea what LEM means mate.
---
oh damn
---
I'm sure they will be, but for you my friend, I'm sorry. If your out on your lonesome... ganking will occur.
---
Lol no they won’t. Bgs didn’t get sparse for me in vanilla and we have crbgs in classic.
---
Wouldnt it make more sense to go retri untill you can grab 5/5 Reckoning? Then you respecc and go wild.
---
(Did you mean 'Retri untill level 32-34', im not sure, you wrote prot)
---
Go for server first 60 if you're worried about ganks
---

Ive done so. Defo like pvp warlock better than priest. But raiding as healing might be the tip for priests.
---
**\[H\]\[PVE\] &lt;Silver Tryhards&gt; Recruiting for Morning Raid**
---
Silver Tryhards is a Horde morning raiding guild that also welcomes casual players.  We value the social aspect of the game above all else.  Our top priority is to attract friendly people.  We will be playing on a PVE server and our goal is to have about 50 core raiders.
---
We will use a DKP loot system that will reward people who contribute to the guild.  Legendaries will be distributed via loot council.
---
Raid Times: Wed/Thurs/Fri
---
PST 7AM-10AM
---
EST 10AM-1PM 
---
Please visit our Discord server to apply.
---
[https://discord.gg/EqRr5MG](https://discord.gg/EqRr5MG)
---
There is hope that EQdkp will be updated. We used it back in vanilla and have module ready on website. Just need an addon
---
You can try, you can try :)
---
I think its like this PVP40%-60%PVE.
---
Therefore priest might be more fun since warlock is boring in pve.
---
Duskwood is unique, because of the questline leading up to stitches (and the dark, dusky atmosphere). If you havent played it before it is well worth a try, if it is better or not then Silverpine is probably more a personal taste, i like playing that as well.
---
lol, Elite quests in a nutshell.
---
I'm curious to know how many people will actually pick-up quests for some of those elite zones and then be bamboozled when they have a hard time killing 1 enemy
---
Never played it. Was too young.
---
Maybe a friendly wave and both be on our day 😂
---
Launch is the fastest time to level for those that are able to get ahead of the zerg (aside from completely empty servers), and Joana's record was set on a fresh realm.
---
The way I remember classic wow it was always quite toxic. So I order to recreate that I'm trying to flame as much as possible, especially of course those moronic retail players.
---
Pserver I guess
---
I'm going with Lawful Evil Meme
---
So what are you playing? 😂
---
If I see someone in barrens chat being unironically racist, I'll probably right click report them. If their parents did a shitty job, it is up to me, a stranger on the internet to help him become a better person.
---
Thanks alot man!
---
nah, I'm betting this will be the same 1.12 AV that we will have in classic wow. Besides they have stated that everything in the game will be as it was in 1.12
---
Well, tbh, female dwarves do have an hourglass figure in some way.
---
For leveling warlock is better imo. Pet control. Able to take on more mobs. Lifetap+drain life. General faster.
---
By polite do you mean just an asshole to a lesser degree? For instance, a polite rogue never uses stealth unless it is to sap a friend. 
---
A polite rogue uses stealth/sap just to stop a mage from eating/drinking, but then leaves in secret so the mage is paranoid for nothing. 
---
A polite rogue ensures that you have completely killed your quest targets before giving you a "goodbye gank".
---
&lt;INFORMAL&gt; \[NA\]\[A\]\[PVE\]\[SEMI-HARDCORE\] MORNING EST
---
We are looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. A new or old player, if you are dedicated, we want you on the team! &lt;INFORMAL&gt; is a brand new guild created from the ground up with Classic in mind.  We are on a PVE server with a PVE focus.
---
GOALS:
---
We will strive to provide an efficient raiding environment for those who want to achieve steady progression through all six phases of World of Warcraft: Classic.  To that end, we are aiming for:
---
\-Week 3 Molten Core clears
---
\-Split-Raids as early as Phase 2
---
\-Clear current content in 1 raid night
---
\-Clear Naxxramas and obtain full Best-in-Slot for our members.
---
With these goals in mind, we hope to create a positive and mature atmosphere within the guild. We are not hardcore in our raid schedule nor do we expect players to put in extreme hours prepping for raids.  However, we do expect reasonable investment from our members.  You must want to contribute and help the entire team succeed. We value maturity and honesty above all else. Every single member is expected to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. All raiding members should be logged on and ready 15 minutes before the raid start time. During progression we expect our raiders to show up with full consumables to help us get the kills we need.
---
RAID SCHEDULE
---
RAID TIMES - Eastern Standard Time (U.S., Morning)
---
RAID DAYS - MON/WED/THUR 
---
Wednesday: 7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
Thursday:  7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
Monday:  7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
The raid schedule shall include world buff acquisition if practical. We will strive for one-day clears, and we will never require raiding on any other day of the week. However, depending on our needs and progress, we may utilize planned raid-day extensions to complete specific content. The intent of each raid day is to clear content and fulfill everyone’s BiS. If there is interest, we may designate optional raid days for alts, or squeeze in an additional farm raid, but not to the detriment of our purpose.

Dungeon grinding is situationally better than questing, but nobody is arguing that it is better than a hunter/mage with an optimal route
---
Welcome to Redridge pussy.
---
The way I see it - 7 billion players by Christmas time. Everybody needs some classic in their lives.
---
no the reason why many people think 2H is better is because they think it will increase the dmg of abilities based on weapon dmg. but those will all be normalized on 1.13 so your speed wont affect mortal strike or abilities of the like anyway. 
---
But... yes it still means a slower harder hitting auto attack will be more useful IF you are using sweeping strikes.
---
I wish we knew how to set our minds to something brother/sister.
---
Haha nice one
---
As long as you understand that my stance is purely: Blizzard should do what they can for a smooth launch for everyone, even if that means beginning a huge marketing campaign for Classic a week or a few weeks later when things have stabilized
---
Loot council can work. But the human error part will always happen.
---
Without Warlocks, there would not be any raiding - who else can ensure all those slackers get summoned so the raid can still start on time?

#  🔷🔷 &lt;ASCENDANCE&gt;🔷🔷 EU | Alliance | PvP 
---
**Region**: Europe
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Server Type**: PvP
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 – 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success.
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
**Raid Roster needs:**
---
* Druids: 1 RESTO
---
* Hunters: Exceptional players only
---
* Mages: Exceptional players only
---
* Paladins: Exceptional players only
---
* Priest:  Exceptional player only
---
* Rogues: Exceptional players only
---
* Warlocks: 1 DPS
---
* Warriors:  Exceptional players only
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM).
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 – 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it’s important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

If I can spot you that is, if I do my Warrior friend might charge you, and I can't control what he does next 😋
---
Cool. And some people work from home. I mentioned that it's possible for a lot of people, not an average.
---
Super time sink. Its a plan but not one I will be following tbh. Thanks alot for the tip though.
---
BC is very very very different from classic
---
My brain hurts from choosing priest healer or warlock at 60. So fcking hard.
---
Law enforcement moment?
---
This is an MMORPG. Toxicity has been activated.
---
Daily quests or repeatable quests?
---
Have had both priest and warlock at 40. Warlock is defo most fun at leveling.
---
i envy your server, ours nearly always went on for up to a week or more
---
This could also be phrased as Retail will have 10 million players ....
---
I always felt the AQ T2.5 gear was godly for PvP, but I was a weird hybrid feral spec for raiding in my guild, 1/31/19 (I think) for off tanking and HT raid healing... Something like that.
---
Thanks alot m8.
---
Ty, i must have been mashing old ps values in with the new.
---
Im not going warrior, mage or rogue by any stretch of my imagination. 😂

We are a New Zealand &amp; Australian based guild, we are being reborn once again for classic. This time round we're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible. While our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.

**Guild Type:** Semi-hardcore  
---
**Loot Rules:** EPGP (specifc items will be loot counciled)
---
**Raiding times will be:**  
---
\- 2030 start till 2300-2330 finish (NZ)- Wednesdays &amp; Thursdays.

**Position Avaliability:**  
---
\- A COUPLE OF WARRIOR TANK SPOTS   
---
\- A COUPLE OF WARRIOR FURY SPOTS   
---
\- CASUALS &amp; PVP FOCUSED PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO APPLY ALSO FOR ALL CLASSES   
---
**More Info:**  
---
We expect all of our members to be respectful of all guidies. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and put in 100% effort.
---
Also we fully expect some people cannot raid as hardcore as they used to, and we have kept that in mind and will be allowing casual's also to join all classes, as long as "if" or "when" they become avaliable to raid they do so by giving their all.

---
OMG NO ITS NOT AVAILIBLE YOU CANT DO THAT YET OMG DONT PRESS THE BUTTON YOUR COMPUTER WILL EXPLODE.
---
Thats pure cringe for me but whatever
---
You can always level up the warlock normally and only level up a priest in rested xp (am planning to do this for two alts)
---
This has nothing to do with high level even. They are referring to dps pulling mobs ahead of the tank as if it were retail in any dungeon. Classic is much different wheres people aren’t roided out in heirlooms etc.
---
They attract new players.
---
Somehow they also have a lot of ways to fuck up.
---
They can also use most weapons and armor types.
---
It's to be expected really.
---
Maybe I've just missed it completely but didn't see this before, took a bit above 4gb :)
---
I'm sure everyone in here is going to tell you to do whatever you like it will be fine! But Spriests are highly dependent on having debuff slots to do anything. Guilds will usually bring 1 to buff their warlocks and pugs can't really benefit from multiple because their debuffs don't stack. Do you have a raid spot? Yes, but you better hope there isn't another SPriest that is more geared/dedicated than you because otherwise you'll start looking at the Holy tree REAL hard so you can raid.
---
Its been available for several weeks (months?) at this point
---
&gt;How would a blue geared (and blue PVP from phase3+) druid cope with other classes at each phase?
---
Druid itemisation is so weird that some of their best gear is random blues. The Druid PvP sets are actually damn good since they're some of the only hybrid gear in the game, and Druids in PvP play as extreme hybrids. Check out [Azgaz's videos](https://youtu.be/MWh2HgRiegc?t=112) for a look at how they play. 
---
It's a very dynamic playstyle. You'll be shifting constantly between whichever form is better for the particular situation you find yourself in. Quick travel form to break snares, Bear Form to tank up against Rogues and Warriors, or to Feral Charge and close the distance to a ranged class, Cat Form to open up on clothies, caster form to root, heal and dps from range. Your DPS isn't particularly high, you're a Druid after all, but on the other hand you're spectacularly hard to kill, and you have a lot of tools at your disposal. You're the only healing class with stealth, you have a ranged root that doesn't automatically break on damage, a spammable ranged DoT, Faerie Fire to make every enemy Rogue hate you, and you're the only class essentially immune to Polymorph, snares and roots. You can absolutely wear does plenty of classes who can't reset the fight against you. Rogue wants to blind you and Sprint off? Pre-cast Abolish Poison and travel form after him. Mage wants to Poly? Just shift out of it and chase him down. Anyone wants to run away? Travel form baby, and thanks to Moonfire you're staying in combat so no mount for you. 
---
So yeah, looking for a PvP alt class? Druid all the way.
---
But how about gold grind? How about respecs? How about playing on your own. 
---
Your comment might have been the most intriguing for me since you really made me want to be priest.
---
&gt; That was not my intention, i have just never played at such a High level (raiding and late game dungeons) which seems to be the sole focus of a lot of you guys (My beloved older brother included) so im not used to the min-maxing-focus on the late game.
---
In retail vanilla (at least on my server) people were expected to not be idiots and not pull aggro off the tank long before endgame. You could get away with it in Ragefire Chasm, you'd get yelled at for in in Wailing Caverns, and if you kept doing it in any 30+ instance people wouldn't group with you again.
---
&gt; It seems to me that most people on this forum expect you to be an expert on every aspect of this huge game (as in if youre not doing everything 100% right and making bad decisions youre intentionally throwing/trolling)
---
I think it's fair to expect that by the time you are 60+ hours into a game you should be capable of understanding the very basics of team play. "Do not pull aggro off the tank" is pretty easy to understand. So is "only kill the thing with a giant skull over it".
---
&gt; I get the point but i am afraid that the overzealousness of some of these people having played wow classic both original and on private servers for decades now might be harmful for the experience of newer players. The question was actually genuine.
---
Well, I hope I answered it clearly enough. A group has a finite capacity to deal with emergencies, and if someone is creating unnecessary emergencies then they markedly increase the chance of deaths and wipes.
---
SEGMENTATION FAULT.
---
Hmm, weird. I'm EU and haven't been in beta, not stress tested, not subbed, yet still could install the client a long time ago already.
---
I'd use it because I'd feel gimped without it. But I'd also find it a hassle. My personal solution is to not play Warrior :)
---
And I love what you do. Don't you know that you're toxiiiic?
---
Working against this thesis: If folks havent played any WOW exp and never have, they arent ponying up the 15 bucks a month now. Many vanilla vets dont want to re-ruin their lives, plus many have families, jobs, and obligations. Private server players are barely a ripple compared with the highest point of the games sub numbers. Lastly, being presented as a museum piece doesnt do the game any favors, it guarentees some measure of authenticity but its not going to win new business, just old-new business from guys like me who havent subbed since TBC. I would say under one million once the hype dies off by October or so.
---
I remember the quests clearly marked as elite.
---
And then you have to help your friend for sure...
---
Haha, I remember my first encounter with an elite mob back in the days. Running around Loch Modan like a complete noob and seeing some ogre with a gold dragon around it's portrait. "All right, what's all this then?"
---
Was like the scene in Monty Pythons quest for the Holy Grail. 
---
"Chaaaaarge!"
---
"Run away!!!"
---
*dazed* *ded*
---
For gearing, my advice is to get rank 10 when you can because this will assure that you have a solid base item set. Rank 10 is not hard to get, and should be possible with only a few hours of battlegrounds daily. Rank 10 full set is very strong, easily comparable to Molten Core epics.  
---
After that you should focus on getting Anathema, and spell damage trinkets. Anathema should be relatively easy to grab, while spell damage trinkets will be a bit more tricky as many will want them.
---
If you can get Nefarian's mace plus AQ40 full set, you will be god tier. Here's a spec that should do well in both raids and PvP:
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05022213--0532522103511051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05022213--0532522103511051)
---
This is a rhetorical question and you know the answer. Of course you will. It's CLASSIC!!1111!
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted and the other person (/u/Albinosmurfs ) found the source, but then chose to reply without linking it to you. For the most part Blizzard has just implied that server names will be released before the 12/13 of August. They haven't actually said it directly in most cases though.
---
However, https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=216087&amp;region=us says it. I got that link from \u\debaserr. This actually directly conflicts with what /u/LastOfOz says. It would appear they SHOULD give the server names before the 12/13th when they allow you to reserve names, and not on those days.
---
Well yeah, in the context of modern days it's kinda dumb and a little cringy, but 13 years ago, this shit was groundbreaking. It was wild see a WoW video that wasn't just 48 hours of play cut down to 5 minutes and overlaid with the shittiest metal of all time (a la Unbreakable).
---
No, the game is terrible and you'll hate it.
---
Keep in mind too that at least for tauren warrior your dead zone is smaller due to the longer range and leeway. Meaning its harder to dead zone kite you (distance between melee range and intercept is smaller)
---
Having played the beta many came to the consensus that tauren were quite formidable against opponents who try to kite, druid, mage, etc. Due to being able to hamstring from over 10 yards away with leeway and increased range, allowing them to stick to their target. This is further range than your war stomp to give you an idea.
---
Orc is still extremely good but tauren shouldn't be totally overlooked for pvp. Plus they are just massive and look sweet in plate. Kodos.
---
I didn't really consider the quest texts. It's been so many years that I don't really remember the quest texts from any of those quests. I will take your word for it. :)
---
I won't hide it, I took off the first week for it. That week alone will tell me if I am going to play the rest of the month or further. Hoping I fall in love with it, but not to the extent of heroin-love, and continue through the months to years playing.
---
The problem with doing stuff like that at 60 is that at 60 people are farming gear that matters. If you want to heal, you're probably running for healing gear. But if you tank, healers aren't going to join you to roll against them for healing gear. You can still kinda gear up by getting priest healers and taking all leather healing gear and healing gear they don't need, but it's slower.
---
It will take a while to hit 60 at 2 hours a day, but once you are you can easily get a couple dungeons or battlegrounds done with only a couple hours a day.
---
Logging in.
---
Flip a coin. If you don’t like the result, choose the other class
---
You had me at "druid pvp sets are actually quite good", everything else you said makes me consider the class as my main!
---
Thanks for the info, classic is going to be a lot of fun.
---
Same with cheap shot.
---
Did I say this was an expert opinion? Did he ask for a expert opinion? If I clearly have no understand of the class mechanics then answer the kids question for him. Be constructive and if you believe something I have said it wrong then correct me. You are the problem on this sub Reddit by bringing nothing to the table but instead acting like child.
---
Why even ask the question when you said it yourself "I want to play classic". What other reason do you need to play a game?
---
My first is going to be a hunter, I played one back in 2006 and I need that nostalgia. I'm also going to level a priest alt with some friends though, we're just doing some dungeon levelling when we all get time to jump on together. At least i'm pretty sure that's my plan. 2 weeks ago i was certain i'd be maining a mage...
---
I leveled as a ambush/backstab rogue. Worked like a charm. 
---
You can blow up one mob very easily- also using kidney shot and pooling energy for max bstabs after opener. Idk I just didn’t have a problem leveling this way.
---
Not dismissing when it's need, not recalling and having the pet body pull stuff when mobs run, sending the pet towards wrong mobs, leaving growl on. There is a lot of potential for messy wipes if you don't manage pets correctly.
---
Watch a lot of YouTube.
---
I will be the kindest and most helpful Warlock in all of Azeroth! Lok’tar ogar!

Hunter levels much more quickly, less gear dependent, very micro managey. Rogue levels slower, needs good weap upgrades, stealth is the shit and changes how you view the game completely. Tough call man, good luck.
---
This is actually a good technique
---
Brb is just fine, I'm gonna be one of those guys this time around. Just make sure you warn the group ahead of time you may have to randomly afk for a few minutes. It's the suspiciously dropping after the boss somebody needed or after a bad wipe that drives people crazy.
---
Hunter is op, rogue is boring af. Ez choice.
---
I feel you. i can't wait to kill some warriors with my mage ;)
---
It's a lot of fun to do that and then sit back watching them run around in circles spamming AOE attacks.

AM = Anti Meridiem
---
PM = Post Meridiem
---
The time it takes for the photons of light to travel from the clock face to you eye ball, (not including the time it takes for your brain to register a signal, let alone process it), more Planck seconds have past than minutes since the beginning of the universe. 
---
So, no, there is no exact 12, time which is inextricably linked with space flows at different speeds in different parts of the universe relative to factors affecting the observer such as velocity and gravity. 
---
Time is not uniform
---
Time does not stop
---
Time is always flowing.
---
Therefore, there is no ‘exact’ moment of 12 that is comprehensible to humans or any machine we have invented where AM or PM isn’t applicable.
---
Which means the ‘moment’ it ticks over to 12, it changes AM/PM and vice versa.
---
I’ll reiterate my point above; “there is no limbo where time is neither AM or PM, because it’s a circular system that is always in motion”
---
So yes, my example does in fact show that on a 12 hour clock system (not 24 hour time, which uses additional numeration instead of AM/PM) there is no practical or philosophical version of 12 ‘o’clock which is neither AM or PM, which is what you are trying to wrongfully assert.

Your should now after reading this post feel thankful, as I have helped educate you free of charge.

You’re welcome. : D

Sir, as someone planning to toll a rogue alt and a warlock twink I am offended.

I'm only an asshole to those players with red names.

Read this, unlike most posters in this thread the author has played a rogue and addresses your specific questions
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-leveling-classic-wow
---
To briefly answer your question, combat is slightly quicker but totally brain dead. It has no positional requirements and you don’t often need stealth when grinding mobs, Since you have consistent damage and have a little aoe (eventually) you can potentially have great xp/hr. 
---
I’ve leveled both ways and vastly prefer daggers. If you get a handle on using positioning while in combat it makes things more fun and it’s a skill that translates to pvp.
---
Again, read that guide. It should help with questions about spec, etc.
---
Just buy a used desktop. Why do you want to use a laptop for gaming?
---
Setting up a bar to mirror the 12 side buttons is fucking genius! That suggestion alone makes asking the question worthwhile! Cheers dude! :)
---
Are most vanilla raid bosses not taunt immune?
---
If you've been reading this forum you must be aware of that this question have been asked many many many many times before. Just read.
---
And Im pretty sure there are a whole pinned post about what class to choose and why.
---
Checkmate OP
---
sick blog post
---
As long as they're targeting the same mob that's exactly how I'd want it. If they're stun-locking, even better. Gives me time to address the other mobs before throwing a taunt on the dps target.
---
If a shaman goes ham with SS+WF+ES and then I taunt it that mob is gonna stick to me way longer than what a single sunder or revenge would accomplish. And I'm sure as hell not gonna throw 3-4 attacks on the dps mob while everything else is swarming the healer.
---
be rogue, get engineer for pets, shoot bow, now also hunter
---
You got me.
---
Yes. Don't buy anything except lvl 5 and 13 wand and bags. Bags actually are worth the investment. Get 4x6 slot first, then wait some levels and the speed levelers will sell 10 slot silk bags. You also get one in WC. Get an autosell junk addon
---
Once TBC came out I rerolled a Draenei Hunter.
---
While i was just started to get into STV near the tigers, a ?? Rogue came to gank me. I ended up kiting him around for 10 minutes and finally managed to kill him. he then tried 3 more times with the same result but i was having a hard time not laughing to much to kite. 
---
He never managed to kill my level 37 hunter...
---
Ive been working on one with more metal-ish.
---
But its a mix up of vanilla/tbc and some newer ones.

I had a level 60 troll shaman alt that in purposely kept level 60 when TBC rollbed by just for AV. Does that count?

**&lt;Red Moon Rising&gt; - Vlaamse/Nederlandse guild - Horde - PvP**
---
Ook zin om de WoW Classic ervaring te (her)beleven met een groep van gelijkgezinde mensen? 
---
Wij zijn een Horde guild die zich op een PvP server gaat vestigen. Onze leden zijn oude rotten uit vanilla/TBC die hun raidervaring graag eens zouden afstoffen en de world PvP die enkel classic te bieden heeft te herbeleven.
---
Ons doel is om doorheen de fases een fijne en geëngageerde groep te maken waarmee we de content kunnen clearen in Classic. Het plan is niet om hardcore steenhard door de content te vliegen, maar met een lach en enige gedrevenheid het spel te beleven.
---
Het plan voor de eerste 3 fases ziet er als volgt uit:
---
**Fase 1** - Samen dagelijks dungeongroups maken en iedereen tot 60 brengen en upgearen. Daarna onze eerste stapjes in Molten Core zetten en Onyxia downen.
---
**Fase 2 -** Met de introductie van het honoursysteem gaan we world pvp squads maken en de wereld afschuimen en verder in MC progressen.
---
**Fase 3 -** Premades runnen om zo hard mogelijk onze PvP-ranks te boosten, daarnaast BWL betreden.
---
Zint dit je wel en zou je graag met andere Belgische/Nederlandse mensen een sterke community vormen, waar het ook niet altijd even serieus moet zijn, kom dan zeker eens kijken op onze Discord of website.

I did this with a random wheel of fortune generator.  
---
I found myself really hoping it would be rogue.  
---
So I thought I was deadset on going rogue.  
---
But then I saw a video about warlocks, and then I read something about resto shamans in raids...  
---
So I'm back to square one.
---
Guess I'll just have to do the wheel of fortune again moments before release and stick with whatever comes out.
---
I believe its short for Lemmings, old time favourite game
---
Is wat?
---
There's also a video of Paladin PvPing and one of the back ground music was the song "oh lord please don't make me be misunderstood" at that part the Paladin was fighting a Rogue and the music really fits the scene. I've been looking for that video but couldn't find it sadly.
---
14 hours a week and you think you won't have enough time?  FFS people you can enjoy this game in short bursts.  You don't have to nolife it.
---
You should pick night elf then.
---
&gt; So other than Paladins, what makes Alliance the side to pick? 
---
There is no real reason beyond what you are looking for in the game.  But here's a couple of thoughts.  
---
Assuming you are going to take the time to enjoy the leveling experience, If I were playing Druid, I'd go alliance.   The entire background lore of the Nelf race revolves around Druids.   Moonglade is close to Darnassas so always handy.  I've always enjoyed questing in Darkshore.
---
I like this except switch lock and mage. And put mage == shaman on a fresh server where opportunities to AOE will be very limited at best.
---
Yeah specifically [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_DYcBvJ8uc)
---
owww that nostalgia hits like a truck :(
---
Ive been on hiatus from the game since BfA launch (still no 120) and was stuck between my Cata main Mage and my TBC main Warrior..... Yesterday, I settled on my main since WoD. A Priest.... Im sure I’ll choose a different class today or tomorrow
---
i've learned over the years that if your playlist doesnt have any Vengaboys it's not really a playlist.
---
i mean who can forget the six flags song?
---
Elitists and the coordination of 40 people for a single Raid. They were both pretty painful.
---
The fuck is LEM
---
But... if nobody buys anything in the AH how I’m going to make gold from selling anything?
---
Hey!
---
I am messaging about joining &lt;Pretentious Latin Name&gt;! Those raid times are perfect for me. 
---
I have experience raiding in late BC and WotLK, as I was just fucking around as a kid during vanilla and early BC.
---
Looking to play... Well, not really sure yet, probably a Mage, Priest or Warlock with a consideration towards Warriors. Yeah, that's most of the classes, but I'll figure it out as needed/in time.
---
I have a life, so a super hardcore guild won't be suitable for me, but I'll still be playing competitively within reason.
---
Let me know if you need anything more!
---
No retri love?
---
It’s ok I’ve narrowed it down to mage lock rogue or warrior. Or maybe shaman.
---
LOL If I was able to play 14 hours a week I wouldn't mind. I won't always have the 2 hours a day to go at it. I want to be able to enjoy, and I feel like an hour is like "just getting into it" time frame :P
---
Warlocks are super over rated they are sooooooo boring and not powerful at all man go mage you will own
---
My two characters were Alliance in Vanilla and I enjoyed the leveling. I originally planned to level the same race/class combo for the nostalgia. 
---
However I realized that while the nostalgia would be strong, playing Horde would capture some of that "fresh new game" feeling from back then.
---
How? Well, like you, I never leveled the opposite faction outside of the starter zone(s) and past level 10 or 15. So everything after that would feel new. I won't have all the quests and locations memorized. The towns and cities would feel different as I never visited them for longer than a bit of wpvp as Alliance granted. 
---
I only ever leveled a Horde character in Legion, well after the Cataclysm and all the changes it wrought.
---
So, for full nostalgia,  do play your original faction. However if you want to recapture a bit of that new game magic, switch sides for Classic.
---
Exactly my reaction. I had to laugh hard when she did this. In the next moment I just hoped the baby was alright.
---
Well in my lucky case i already knew what i was going to roll (undead mage), so i aoe grinded one to 60 on a p-server(didn't touch the mage after 60 so i don't burn out) and watched some yt vids about the class and shit, made a list of items i need to get, chose my professions for leveling and at 60 (i'm going to be switching and have to lvl engineering to 300 twice in addition to that). Made plans with the friends and created a discord channel to get everyone i know to play on one server. Took a week off and going to LAN with the guy i started playing classic with back in 2005. Also made a list with some addons i need. Now i wait and suffer.
---
Or you can just taunt and you don't have to wait at all.
---
Bringing the mathematics into it, I like it. You're making this a better idea for me \^\_\^
---
Ive never felt this so much on a personal level
---
Sounds good to me. Feel free to join the discord! First guild photo is scheduled for this upcoming stress test
---
I want to have the time to play and not waste the money if I can't play it :(

True!
---
I love playing a Shaman, but I can't go Horde.
---
FML
---
i posted a playlist a while back and my post was deleted by mods :)))) weird sub
---
That's what I'm sayin I know it's definitely going to take me a while which is also making me reconsider what class I would even be playing you know?
---
Pretty sure that's only in the instanced version from the TBC caverns of time.
---
In both of your specs, you have taken Divine Str over Divine Int... while leveling, the Str has more return (dmg and block), but at Max level, your mana hungry rotation almost requires (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) you to go into the +10% Int. Also your Pre-Raid BiS gear will provide plenty of Strength, and if you desire more, enchant or get consumables that provide more.
---
The Exact same argument exist for your choice to go Anticipation. 5 talent points for only 10 Defense is NOT WORTH-IT (thats like 1 enchant and 1 different item equipped difference). Toughness is percent multiplicative to your current armour value, and thus scales with buffs and consumables, making this well worth the 5 talents points. From my experiences as a Prot Tank back in 1.9, I would take 2 of these talent points and invest into Guardian's Favour as your BoP can act as a mini-taunt. Example, a Warlock take threat from you during a pull (Raid or Dungeon doesn't matter) you apply your "Taunt" macro'd (BoPing them then applying Blessing of Sacrifice to instant cancel BoP) effectively re-gaining control of the pull.  Guardian's Favour reduces the CD of your "Taunt" from 5 mins to 3 mins.... The utility this provides you as a tank, is way more important then the small amount of defense you will miss out on.  
---
You can choose to keep 3 talents into Anticipation, but I actally like maxing out Imp. Hammer of Justice, as alot of the pulls you as a Prot Pally will be tanking (mainly large trash pulls in raids) are stun-able by HoJ and will increase your survivability. Now you will have to learn when to use this spell, because a Stunned enemy isnt attacking you, hence not generating threat via your Ret Aura or your Block Dmg through Holy Shield... but in does provide you (a tank) with a interrupt on a 45 sec CD, so it IS worth it.
---
If they did reach 10 mil subs they probably would want to tell shareholders what a great idea they had when **they thought out** **the idea** to make Classic
---
I don't think I can do it... I'm to old. Don't have the energy or time to join a 24 hour long BG
---
SHEEEEIIIIITT YEAHHHH!
---
I wish!!! Between 2 jobs and other non-job related activities we'll probably only average 20ish hours a week IF we're lucky (and most of that time will come from weekends). 
---
In reality I'm planning on playing this game for a loooong time, which should give my wife and I plenty of time to play/raid on our mains and level at least 1 of our alts to 60.
---
Nah, I like elvui, but only because the developer behind spartanui stopped... Man I loved that one.
---
This is absolute quality stuff. Thanks for putting this together!
---
Midnight in germany
---
Orc shaman here, I mapped out a route for completing all UC quests to 60.
---
Takes a bit longer to level as you aren't really questing efficiently but it does make the leveling up process much more clear as you have very well defined goals and the quests dictate where you go.
---
Overall, even completing them all up to 60 and a few at, you'll still be short a few thousand rep. But that won't cost much more than a couple hundred gold at worse to wrap up exalted.
---
Yeah but you don't need more than 1 hunter doing it. If you assume the average of 3 Hunters per raid group then the majority won't be doing that.
---
only slaves bow
---
Okay cool lets get back to the main point of the wow universe not being a vacuum
---
You could absolutely go play Alliance and be a paladin, but you would be stuck buffing and throwing out marginal heals as a generic human or as one of Snow White's bitches. You could also stick with horde and play any of the badass races and any other class.
---
Low Energy Meme

Read the post
---
Single city auction house.
---
Lmao.
---
Awesome. Currently revamped my computer so waiting on my monitors and GPU, but they definitely should be in by then. I'll be joining the Discord shortly!
---
Laughter Evoking Minors?
---
well, I stand corrected. I created a starter account while waiting for classic and they just keep offering me to upgrade to BFA for 45. I also looked at the blizzard website and that lists the 45eur + sub price as well. 
---
Had no idea you could just buy a sub and play retail. What datadisk is the 'base game' at?
---
The green one looks pretty good too, if your gear is mostle green.
---
Fortunately for me, eventually the gear will all be green/blue so it works out.
---
And the defilers tabard.
---
You mean the skill that misses and has a cooldown? Pulling, threat and tanking in general is night and day from retail to classic or pservers. DPS just waiting for threat to be established means things go faster because healers use less mana, tanks use less rage and there's less downtime between pulls.
---
Play a shaman and name him Thex!
---
Yes. Windfury procs from your mainhand weapon and you'll have faster attacks with a 1 hander + offhand. You can put an elemental sharpening stone on your offhand for extra crit and your rage dump ability will be heroic strike instead of slam. 2hander can do comparable DPS, but dual wield will generate more consistent damage once you're properly geared.
---
Pull faster and that wont be a problem
---
Changing my mind daily on warlock or mage. It's soo fun \s
---
Swam off the coast with a warlock and another guildie, who put water breathing buff on us so we could swim as far down as we could and through Fatigue, and summon another buddy who was in an AV Battleground.  We told him we needed help, summoned him, and enjoyed watching him zone in, look around and realize where he was, and desperately swim to the surface before drowning just before reaching it.  Who says the opposite faction got to do all the ganking? :)
---
Life Extinguishing Moment?
---
Rogue is just sooooo popular.
---
You have no clue
---
True, I just thought I'd explain in case someone wasn't aware of this role.
---
Nah
---
Leveling priest as shadow wasn't that bad for me. You can heal dungeons as shadow too. The hive mind says priest is painful leveling but I strongly disagree
---
&gt;Probably just copy and paste from classic wow client.Classic Naxx time-walking raid when?
---
We already had a classic naxx time-walking raid... It was called wotlk naxx. It was about as hard as your average timewalking raid too.
---
I want to try something different and healing seems nice, i dont  want to just spam frostbolt in raids. Im going to be raid healing and then Shadow for wpvp. I dont mind farming the 100g each week to respec, once we get bgs i can heal in pvp.
---
Priests have always seemed cool and now it is time to try it. I have always been dps in wow (Rogue, Mage and Warlock)
---
Honestly spoken, without any chance to change your ingame name, you have a kind of reputation. Are you a fool, you getting "blacklisted"...
---
Thats how it worked ...
---
This is hilarious, can't believe I haven't seen this, my favorite was always the funeral raid video.
---
The fastest levelers will blow Joana out of the water but we all still have respect for the OG wow speedrunner.
---
I finally narrowed down to four (warr, lock, mage and shaman) and damn, i really love those four classes
---
Yes I should have read it
---
I will at least have my original character as one of the three reserves we get, but I'm not sure that will be the first character I play.
---
I have not seen that
---
, instead of I have seen people who enjoy bfa defend it when vanilla fans "shit on it" which is often
---
I can empathize with this conundrum but I agree that your best alternative is to recruit someone who enjoys tanking if no one in your circle is willing.
---
Considering classic is tied to retail, there's no reason for them to tell the shareholders that though. But you're probably correct that they will /flex the number of subs WoW increased to in general, but giving credit to classic WoW alone doesn't make sense since shareholders want to see retail WoW (microtransaction heaven) do better.
---
Don’t be slow and they won’t have to pull for you. Lasy ass muthafukn tanks.
---
I'm going with my original roll for my main. Which is a human warlock. As of right now I'm most likely going to roll a warrior for a tanking alt. The only tanking I've done has been frost DK in wotlk. Tried leveling a warrior up in time to tank TBC but only made it to ~66 before the previous expansion patch came out.
---
No. They are linked in 1.12
---
His record was at launch on a fresh server that opened late in vanilla. When you are one of the first people out of the starting area and you play nonstop for the first day, it gets you far enough ahead of everybody that it might as well be a dead server.
---
It would be pretty sad if they cut the servers up like a cake with layering and we still dealt with server connection issues/queues... would be a pretty big waste of time on their part..
---
BfA &amp; Legion had great launches so I don't think it will be too bad
---
Can we stop posting this bi-weekly.
---
Two hours a day is a lot ..
---
Ima just recreate my characters I remember from back then mainly Tauren warrior and troll hunter

# &lt;Pure Luck&gt; [A] | East Coast NA - PVP | Tue/Wed, 7:00 p.m.-10:30 p.m. EST | Semi-Hardcore PvE | Loot Council
---
**About Us**
---
Pure Luck is a new guild formed just for the release of Classic World of Warcraft. Our members want to experience everything that Classic has to offer, while still maintaining balance between the game and our adult lives. We are mostly in our mid-twenties to mid-thirties, and have played WoW on and off since its original release. Our goal is to clear all PvE content within each relevant release phase while raiding less than ten hours per week.
---
Our core team has well over 100 years of combined raiding experience in WoW, dating back to the original release. Many of us have served as guild leaders and officers of guilds across every expansion, but we all have a soft spot for the vanilla days. We have learned a lot over the years and we can't wait to go home again.
---
We are what you might call 'semi-hardcore', in that we expect every raider to know how their class functions, how boss fights work, how to properly itemize and what consumables to bring to raids, but we plan to spend less than ten hours per week raiding.
---
Our members value **integrity, patience, growth, humor and humility**. We want members who:
---
* Embody our values and prioritize guild progress over personal short-term gain.
---
* Sign up for raids on the calendar at least 24 hours before the scheduled event.
---
* Prepare for raids ahead of time and log in for invites 15 minutes before the scheduled raid time.
---
* Stay focused during raids so that we can keep moving.
---
We don't tolerate:
---
* Condescending, prejudicial, or discriminatory behavior
---
* Abusive, threatening or excessively hostile behavior
---
* Spamming, trolling, ninja-looting, and other anti-social behavior
---
**Recruiting Needs:**
---
We are building as lean a roster as possible to minimize the number of people that have to sit out on raid nights. The needs listed below only pertain to those who wish to raid regularly.
---
* Druid:        Low (Resto)
---
* Hunter:      Closed
---
* Mage:        Medium
---
* Paladin:     Closed
---

great video!
---
for me though, it was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWEjvCRPrCo
---
Mine was Setz and Plex part deux
---
Definitely play what you want. You should be able to meet lots of tanks to do dungeons with, and your raid guild should definitely have other people who WANT to fill the tank spots (at least until naxx). 
---
Yes it may take a little longer to find some groups when you're gearing up just after hitting 60. However, don't sell out a druids solo prowess or wPvP ability. They actually kill it. They just won't be DPSing well in raids like you like.
---
As a now 35 year old former gamer with a family, changed habits, new hobbies, and different outlook on life; this post strikes close to the heart. I also view this as a return "home" and this is the ONLY game I have been hyped for in years. I'll see you in there my friend, perhaps as red or green, but we'll both be home.
---
Maybe it will be a good idea to say what server type, faction and region you are going for.
---
True. Although I'm sure people will be able to guesstimate how many of those subs are thanks to Classic.
---
I have taken a few days off work so i can enjoy the launch. we have 6 weeks of vacation time, so the 3 days is nothing major for me.
---
I also haven't made any plans for those days or the following weekend.
---
I am also reading up on addons which i will setup on launch day while i setup my undead priest.
---
then don't... play for a few hours or however long you want to
---
12, when you've got it talented.
---
And you're going to tell me that Rend does more damage per rage, yeah? Problem is Rend is a DoT and deals damage pitifully slow.
---
I seriously don't understand why you're saying "don't use heroic strike", what are you just going to sit there and autoattack while at 100 / 100 rage?

If people pull aggro don’t always chase. If you can spare a taunt without losing the other two mobs then ok, buts better to keep 2-3 mobs perfectly locked down and have a mage nova the loose add while dps burns it, as opposed to you losing aggro on other mobs as you chase the first.
---
Actually people are arguing that. Groups in the beta with fresh characters had substantially faster leveling times than Joana’s level-by-level breakdown while spamming RFC, SM, and a few other dungeons.
---
Do you have any macros set up for mob marking? Like a mouseover where no modifier is skull, shift is x, &amp; ctrl is moon?
---
Obviously rogue.
---
I don't mind going with a plastic shell. Is there minimum specs for classic yet? I'm assuming not as many computers will be compatible with classic as vanilla
---
My original character in vanilla was a mage.  This time I'll probably roll it as an alt for gold farming.
---
I leveled a paladin to 60 last year on a private server and will be sticking with it in Classic.  I love the high survivability, free mount and little to no trouble finding dungeon groups to good to want to go back to mage for my main.
---
Just subscribe before the 26th 23:00 BST and you can start playing straight away. Don’t worry about all these other things yet, just dive in and play the game however you want. Join a leveling guild and ask for help when needed. I’d recommend a PvP server (where opposing factions can attack each other in certain zones) as it makes the world feel more real and dangerous.
---
A stress test is to test the severs to prepare for the amount of people about to be on them in under a month. 
---
Your standard WoW subscription will allow you to play Classic and retail
---
And as far as realms go, I can’t really help you there because I never played classic myself but some realms are more for PvP while others are for PvE so just choose one that fits to your play style, also being in a heavily populated realm will help you find people to play with easier. Which is a must in Classic.

dafuq
---
I have a budget of ~ 3 hours per week (12 hours/4 weeks) and I still feel like the cost would be worthwhile.
---
This one makes sense for tournaments for the sake of time, and in a horde tournament no one has perception so the advantage is basically all the rogues' anyway. I dont agree with it but for time's sake it makes sense.
---
Pretty much.
---
Was that the old "Hot Wheels PC" monitor?
---
thank you for bfa
---
Do you know or think if horde loosing result from map design, player skill, faction motivation, faction strategy etc? I guess I am asking why they lose, or why you perceive they lose?

&gt; **Takeover is a semi-hardcore PvP focused guild, comprised of experienced private server and vanilla players who have achieved as high as R12 in classic PvP.** 
---
&gt; We plan to hit classic strong and gear up so that we can raid and get BiS for the release of the ranking system in Phase 2.
---
&gt; We are a mature group of players who are focusing on enjoying Phase 1 of classic (the way it was meant to be enjoyed originally) while staying true to a hardcore path to dominate the ranks upon the release of Phase 2 and Phase 3.
---
💪 __**What we are looking for**__
---
&gt; **All roles, class leads, &amp; officer positions available**
---
&gt; We are looking for players new and old who are interested in smashing gnome skulls, have a willingness to learn, and a competitive drive. We plan to create a community first, and a dynasty on our server second.
---
💰 __**Loot Structure**__
---
&gt; We are currently using a unique version of the **Loot Council** system in which the council will follow a strict set of pre-defined criteria. Council members will also be swapped out every 2-3 weeks to ensure fairness in loot distribution.
---
&gt; **Some of the criteria is as follows:** Activity, PvP ability, Raiding ability, Recruitment prowess, Leadership ability, &amp; more.

Then the one you wish wins actually wins so you wish something else wins so you roll again. It will happen.  
---
I was dead set 100% not changing my mind on paladin, then mage, then shaman, then hunter, then warrior, then druid.
---
no. and dont talk about it being talented because I could just argue about the talented rend which does more damage per rage as well..
---
and no, I will not sit at 100 rage because I will be refreshing my shouts, I will be applying hamstring and yes.. I WILL be fishing for dodges so I can overpower. fishing for dodges is much more efficient than using rage on heroic strike.. I urge you, since you arent going to be convinced by 1 person. to join the real warrior discord to get educated on how to properly play a warrior, DM me for the discord server Ironskillet2

&gt;This is an MMORPG. A real one.
---
Throwing shade in a post dedicated to not being toxic towards retail players/noobs.
---
Unreal how oblivious some people can be
---
... I thought I had finally settled on a class but now I can’t even decide on a faction. Thanks
---
wont have to buy anything, anyone with an active WoW sub can play.
---
Stress test is a chance to log in and fart around up to level 15, its on Thursday at 2 pm eastern time
---
pick a server and play at launchtime, if you are total noob you will probably want to try different races/classes to find out what one is fun for you
---
biggest thing is just have fun, its an amazing game with a totally insane community, something for everyone
---
Will it be powerful enough to run it at the lowest settings without clipping the graphics?
---
Experienced US Priest or shaman/paladin LFG (PvP or Pve for raids) with not so late raid times. Work schedule dictates me being able to play mainly from 1pm EST- 10pm EST at the latest for raids. Pst for more info!
---
I mean to say making it unplayable
---
Shadows underperform healing wise at 60, obviously spec and all, and you would need an overgeared tank to clear dungeons.
---
PvP wise bottom of the barrel, you won't find a premade.

Guys, what the flying f\*\*k is LEM?
---
The fact that classic is not out yet...
---
and no, heroic strike will cost you roughly 24 rage untalented, and about 21 rage talented.
---
I have no idea, just went with the flow.
---
at level 40 with identical full int focused bis gear, a gnome has 9 more int than a undead mage, and 7 more int than a human mage. (100-150 mana more), so a very minor benefit.   
---
It does amplify slightly at max level with lots of int, and at that point they might be marginally better, but for leveling the difference is so small that nobody would ever notice.  
---
As far as spirit goes the difference is just as tiny,  I didnt focus on spirit on my gear but the UD mage actually has more than the Human one (a whopping 2 spirit more).
---
My alt will be that, but my main is something fresh
---
No idea, just trolling like everyone else.
---
There are AHs in every major city in 1.12
---
The need for bank alts. Nowadays, with materials in your bank, it's really easy. especially for guilds.
---
I dont wanna think about bank-alts just for zul gurub coins...
---
Classic comes out on mine
---
Hybrids. They suck enough to not be viable, but not enough to not be doable. So plenty of people try, most end up useless, and the ones that do put in the effort get stuck with a stigma. And don't even get rewarded for their effort because their dps still doesn't come close to warriors.
---
I like the idea of a hybrid tax but most of them are just really poorly designed. e.g elemental shamans not getting a -nature resist debuff.
---
Nice!
---
&gt; I will be refreshing my shouts
---
which you only need to do every 2 minutes
---
&gt;I will be applying hamstring
---
which you only need to do once, MAYBE twice per mob
---
&gt;I WILL be fishing for dodges so I can overpower. fishing for dodges is much more efficient than using rage on heroic strike
---
What the actual fuck.
---
You can't "fish" for dodges in specific. Also, "fishing for dodges" does not use rage, it GETS YOU RAGE BECAUSE YOU'RE HITTING THE MOB. Like what the fuck, I feel like I'm being trolled here. Everything you say just sounds more and more dumb than the last thing you said.
---
GG 10/10 bait got me to reply, blocked.
---
The hit is a fair point, it's harder to get for a Ret. But the rest? frostbite and shatter are irrelelevant for bosses and vs trash mage easily wins anyway. Double crit damage is baseline for ret pala and I also didn't add consecration to any of the math anyway, neither did I use judgement of the crusader (would be worth another ~6-10dps).
---
Yeah, it's fine, that ret does less dmg at max level. It's nonsense, that ret deals noticeably less dps than other classes while leveling. They are at worst about even with other melee classes, the only melee spec I believe does more dps than a ret while leveling is a dagger rogue, who you are ont that likely to find due to no frontstabbing. They can keep up or even beat with all other melee specs in dps. The lower the level, the better. If you run deadmines or stockades in the low 20s, rets are likely even the #1 dps as they have their full toolkit and an overpwoered weapon. The gap starts to open on higher levels, when the other classes get their toolkit together and gear plays more of a role, but until you go into the top level dungeons (i.e. brd+), there is zero reason to assume taking a ret will hurt your parties dps output. Especially if you consider the passive dps you don't see on the meters created by a paladin via retribution aura or blessing of might.
---
Some math for Rogue? Sure. Let's say a lvl 32 combat rogue. Standard rotation 5 Sinister + Eviscerate. Takes 235 energy to execute, rogue has 700 energy in the first minute of the fight, so three times in the first minute. Sinister deals weapon dmg + 22. Bis weapon dmg at this point 23 dps weapon + 20 dps from AP normalized to 2.4 speed. So, 125 dmg per Sinister, 15 in a minute, reduced by 30% due to armor 1314.6 dmg per minute or 22 dps. Eviscerate deals 255 dmg and you get 3 in a minute, so 535 dmg after armor, meaning 9 dps. That's 31 dps from yellow attacks. White dps has ~20% miss chance, so you have 43 dps on mainhand, which reduced by about half due to misses and armor, for ~22 dps and I'm not sure how the offhand dps is calculated exactly, so I'll just assume 10-15 dps from the offhand, so that's 32-37 dps total. Finally instant poison. 20% chance to proc, expect ~40-45 hits per minute, so 8-9 procs for 34 dmg is around 4.5 dps. Total dps for lvl 32 combat rogue: 67.5-73.5. That's for the first minute, afterwards the rogues dps is lower, as the initial 100 energy isn't there, which results in only 2.5 rotations per minute or ~58-62 dps.
---
Ret paladin at the same level with same gear. Weapon would still be Verigans fist, which is heavily outdated at this point. Would be 48.3 white dps reduced by 30% that's 34 white dps after armor. SoC procs are 12.5 dps and JoC is 11dps. Retribution aura would be another 4 or 6 dps. That's 61.5 or 63.5 dps total with a heavily outdated weapon. If we were to give the pala The Pacifier (best possible weapon at lvl 32), white dps would increase to 39 and SoC dps to 17 putting the pala at 71 or 73 dps total, slightly ahead of the rogue or about even. If you factor in bom, the rogue will likely be ahead.
---
For warriors it's pretty easy. We can assume white dps is identical. Let's stay with the lvl 32 and pacifier (yes, warriors don't have any have any of their instants at that point). A SoC proc with Pacifier is 147 dmg. A whirlwind is ~120 dmg, a MS is  ~179 dmg, a bloodthirst is 126. You get 7 SoC Procs per minute, so ~1030 dmg per minute and judgements are ~630 per minute. That adds up to 1660 dmg per minute, which the warrior needs to exceed with his instants. Let's assume overpower + deep wounds is equal to ret aura. So, the warrior needs all 10 MS or all 10 Bloodthirsts and 3 whirlwinds to equate that dmg. Does he get enough rage for that? The arms warrior, possibly, the fury unlikely. And before warriors get their lvl 40 instants, they are hopelessly behind a ret.
---
Speaking as a tank, I always try to tank even if they pull extra. I'd rather give them a fucking roasting after the pull than just let them die on the spot.
---
A lot of the time DPS just pull a couple extra mobs that you can handle. I don't mind this if they're considerate of the packs and know how much is too much. I don't agree with the "just let them die". It just creates way more friction than necessary. Just tell them that you would rather pull and if they don't listen, just deal with it as best as you can.
---
The 27th is Tuesday
---
wow i feel sorry for this guy.. like seriously hes gonna be wondering why the warriors around him are blowing through mobs and hes struggling
---
This was of my first WoW vids: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRevrAUjHnM
---
So excited for classic although I know that magic will never return :(
---
OG Naxx wasn't the hardest raid in the game solely because the fights were hard. It was a different time in vanilla and there are honestly endless factors that play into OG Naxx feeling harder. People were less experienced, most weren't using macros and keybinds. You didn't have giant HP pools and deaths during fights were a lot more unforgiving. By the time Wrath came out, these mechanics were old news vs people dealing with them for the first time. There were no welfare epics. The fights were tuned for raids of all types meaning you weren't forced into bringing specific classes. No one needed to grind out frost resist gear in Wrath. Naxx was also the last raid in Vanilla which is notorious for being the guild killer in every expansion. 
---
I could go on but I think you get the point.
---
I'm so sorry, the name Thex is taken
---
Freedom of Speech issues aside... the mechanic will be abused because the consequences aree automated. It is a shitty mechanic. It should not be implemented. Ignore list exists for this purpose already. Censoring someone globally should not be a possibility from an automated, abusable mechanic.
---
Be a paladin 😎
---
How about only being able to mail 1 thing at a time!
---
Because people who play BFA consistently have bought character boosts/WoW tokens with real money to accomplish things within the game and when Classic comes out and outshines (hypothetically of course ;)) retail all of the money they spent on the modern game will have gone to complete waste.
---
Same goes for a shadow priest but with higher dmg.
---
Mind blast -&gt; SW:P - &gt; Mind Flay -&gt; Wand til dead.
---
Thanks to spirit tap you never run oom. You just gotta Wand a lil extra like every 4th/5th mob.
---
Don't bother with the stress test. It will only stress you out.
---
Keep in mind that you're not really racing the clock to the next patch/expansion release like in retail. You're playing vanilla and that's it, you can be slow and take your time leveling and progressing through the end game content. 1-2 hours a day is plenty to enjoy the game.
---
Some raids and dungeons are gonna require more time  but if you plan your time and can get a few extra hours for a raid in the weekends sometimes you can even get through those (ZG, MC, BWL &amp; AQ20 will probably be quite PUG:able after a few months if you don't have time to do scheduled raiding with a guild).
---
some people on this sub think you should roll greed on boes LOL
---
Much slower.
---
I hate that spriest isn't more viable in raids :/
---
 &lt;Eternal&gt; NA HORDE PVP - Loot Council - Hardcore
---
Eternal is looking for more dedicated raiders for our roster! We are group of players who met in recent private servers looking to group up into Classic. Our background is one of few REAL 15/15 Naxx clears, and with some of the fastest clears ever recorded for Naxxramas.
---
We will begin raiding somewhere in the 2nd or 3rd week. We are not requiring our members to be ready to go in that timeframe, but you should be ready to go somewhere within 5 weeks. As we have experience leading pug raids, we will pug MC raiders until we have a full guild raid.
---
We will have guild premades and many people ranking into the 12+ range. We bring experience from private servers and real motivation for ranking, as we have done it on private servers and know what it entails. Our raids will be either the fastest on the server or very close. We will not require hardcore consumables on content that is on farm every week (Flasks).
---
Our goal is to be top dog without enabling an unfun and toxic environment like other hardcore guilds, leading to guild breakup.
---
Raid days are Tuesday + Wednesday at 5PM PST / 8PM EST. Will be running 2nd pug raids on Saturdays sometime in the late morning / early afternoon.
---
If you want to apply/join, please message me or the other officers mentioned in our discord server. [https://discord.gg/KHqSB64](https://discord.gg/KHqSB64)
---
Of course I failed to answer properly. 28th at midnight.
---
the most important thing to know is that you never want to run up to the mobs. you want to pull them from range (or have a teammate do it if you cant) and then lead them back to somewhere it's safe to fight them. unfortunately your DPS will have to wait for things to stabilize before they can begin.
---
You can pick it up later and you can save your cloth for that. It's usually not worth crafting anything while leveling.
---
It's changed a ton.
---
40-60 is much better since that's when u go shadow. Your kill speed is faster while still retaining good regen thanks to spirit tap.
---
I was a noob ele shaman, but I was level 60. I had dungeon blues ,but in STV I felt powerful. I’d sit on the road in front of Booty Bay and wait for action. I was mostly a protector. I’d ask if anyone was being ganked or would just watch chat since back then people called it out all the time. Players were constantly looking for wpvp.
---
All these idealistic millennial posts makes me cringe. 
---
"Be nice, not toxic." 
---
Oh boy are you in for a treat in three weeks.
---
These types of posts have to be one of, if not the lowest effort posts on this subreddit. I'd rather hear about sharding again than some person telling 159,902 people to play nice. So fucking dumb.

People should of course play the game how ever they find most enjoyable. But some people seem to think the only way to enjoy Classic is by rushing, beating the crowd, playing several hours every day. And that of course is not true, you can enjoy Classic even if you only play a few hrs now and then. I think this is the misconception some people are arguing against.
---
I think this falls in the same category as waiting for CDs, changing trinkets or other use items before duel and waiting the 30s CD. Do you want to simulate 'fair' 1v1, open world 1v1 or some other thing.
---
People who are unhappy with game shit on it while people who enjoy it don’t? That’s nuts dude.
---
Please don't use "toxic", it's an overused buzzword.
---
Honor system!
---
And I'm surprised that people look at it mostly with nostalgia. It's a system rewarding mindless grind, account sharing and unhealthy amount of playtime for rank 12 and above that punish people for taking days off.
---
Not only it's stupid (which I think I could deal with) but it's dangerous as it force people to play more than they want.
---
That's not the issue. The AH in each city (IF, SW, Darn) were not linked so if you posted an auction in IF, only people using the IF auction house would be able to see it.
---
No it’s 27th at midnight so it releases Monday/Tuesday night not Tuesday/Wednesday 
---
The 24 hour clock starts at 00:00 not 00:01
---
Yes.
---
I suspect that early on, the devs figured healing wouldnt be a popular choice, so they made sure that the classes who could heal had strong kits to compensate for the general undesirability of the healing role. Once that was set, you started to see the hybrid dps and tank specs take off in tbc.
---
The thing about a game is you play it because YOU enjoy it. When someone else tells you its shit why not tell them to fuck off and tell someone who cares about their opinion?
---
Honestly most of the 1-60 content is exactly the same in vanilla as it was in TBC. Late into TBC (I think 2.3?) they buffed lots of low level dungeon items to blues and nerfed some elite quests, but outside of that it's like 90% the same.
---
My alts will take it slow. My main is gonna be in mc before the first month is over.

Zg, AQ, and Naxx all had a crap ton of currency items that dropped off trash. Such a pain in the ass.
---
It will be 1.12. The reference client they have for Classic doesnt contain any other data.
---
I don't really have your problem (I'm a natural facilitator), if I'm with a group I commit to the group, more often than not that means filling in for a key/specialist role that if left to anyone else would result in a complete and utter collapse of the group dynamic).
---
***
---
I'm going to make a massive assumption that (as far as online gaming/grouping is concerned) you're not all that social. Many people would simply use that 'ability-to-tank' to get their foot in the door of a new friendship/relationship and build their social network from there. You might introduce yourself as a tank but very few people would have the expectation that you're a tank and nothing but a tank. Generally once you've established a level of trust and a history of cooperation you end up being 'one of the guys', so to speak.
---
At the very least Feral Druids will readily tear Rogues a new one in PvP, so you have that going for you (in addition to all the other things you feel a Druid can do).
---
- I will not level my alt to level 5. He will be good at level 1 (never loged in) to have a mailbox where I can mail stuff too. Some days after release you can level him to 5 in fracture of the time required at release.
---
- You should have a lvl 5 enchanter. Everything else is optional. Alchemy and tailoring provide a passive income though. I will level several alts to level 35 to finance my main
---
-  Have fun
---
Thanks, I just found it, as well.  I freaked out a little bit.
---
This!
---
this is about how much time i will have a day realistically and I definitely plan to play.  I'll stay up late a few nights here and there to knockout a longer dungeon or if i find a raid group on my timetable once i hit 60 but 2hrs is plenty to just enjoy the leveling and some lighter dungeon/pvp content
---
Cut all your skin off. No more crawling. Problem solved! 
---
Ofc this does introduce other issues so perhaps not?
---
Thank you!!
---
What’s the point of Classic WoW if. I can’t scorn some plebians?
---
One of my most hated features was dual spec and reduced respec cost because it meant that you weren't as well known for you tanking or healing ability since anyone could just quickly respec and do what you do.
---
I knew every single good tank and healer in vanilla and tbc. After dual spec was introduced none of it really mattered anymore.
---
jajajajaja
---
When you discover rogue with lucky aoe or he is too slow to go stealth its part of game imo.
---
Yea true the theoretical max is crazy. But in reality you don’t have pristine aoe grinding spots for 60 levels. I’m also really curious to see how nerfed it is on classic v pservers. From what I’ve seen it’s drastically worse. Which is a real bummer because aoe grinding is one of my favorite parts of vanilla (on pservers...)
---
Nobody in their teens would wanna play this lol. And this is an awesome thing :) Its just us, the grown ups, mostly, jaded, disappointed, wanting to relive the first days of MMORPgs in their glory.
---
That mmo forum seems to have a more mixed bag between retail players and classic elitists. Did you notice how many people in that thread actually think classic wow mobile would work and be (somehow...) playable?
---
Don't you throw the freedom out the window when you click ok to their EULA? either way, I agree but thats 2019 Blizzard trying to cut down on customer service costs by moving things towards automation
---
Great reminder! Today it's so easy to get all info from Google and avoid making mistakes.
---
But for World of Warcraft I like making mistakes as long as I have fun making them :)

It's the up's as well as the down's that make Classic what it is (to me) - no matter which way you experience them. May it be while rushing to 60 and dying a couple of times - loosing the Advantage you have on your competitors or may it be you Walking into STV and then realizing you went the wrong direction the whole time :P Those experiences bind you to the game and make you immerse even more.
---
Pve server is over there...
---
That thought is one of the reasons I want to go Horde. To relive the terror of being ganked in IF by an undead rogue in tier armor, but from the other side of the blade. lol
---
I do like that the Horde has a better lvling path and nearly immediate easy access to places that require loooong alliance runs. 
---
But nightelfs do flips when they jump, so tough call.
---
Doesn't /join world work ?
---
just like literally every other expansion release then
---
Now does the stress test not carry over into the game? Like the progress you’ve made on ST
---
Priest is one of the few classes with zero downtime. You can grind forever without going oom.
---
Also shadow priest is one of the strongest classes in wpvp /1v1.
---
unless you're a lore nerd use a guide this games quests are dookie.
---
Yea thats my thinking too, and why I dont agree with that rule
---
Cuz then all AOEs are useless.
---
What can I say.. I loved the game from vanilla through wotlk and I won't apologize for that. Hell, I almost ruined my life because of how much I loved it.
---
There is no auto dismount when you press spell
---
People will be buying just to stock up when it's cheap.  Also, not everyone is rushing to 40.  The slower, casual people won't care if tehy get a mount exactly at 40 and spend money on gear to have more fun, easier to level.
---
We need to update the bingo to include Thex and people telling others how to enjoy the game.
---
Yeah just have a good 100-125 jokes ready to keep your group entertained while you drink twice as much as the healer.
---
Short and sweet. Real neck beard tips.
---
Maybe a pve server is right for you
---
I'd vote for respec cost as well, it's bad enough being forced to PVE so I can PVP without having to pay for the privilege.
---
Well this Paladin PvP video has that song:  [https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=245491](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=245491) 
---
But it's from WoD so I guess it's not the one you're talking about.
---
&gt; Many vanilla vets dont want to re-ruin their lives plus many have families, jobs, and obligations
---
I love how this sub thinks that in order to be good at Classic you need to throw away all of your responsibilities.
---
If you aren’t a wage slave working insane hours to make your boss richer then maintaining a decent character is no problem, even so Blizzard has promised to keep Classic running forever so *millions* of people will trek the adventure at some point if their free-time is too clogged up right now.
---
It's map design. That bridge leading to the alliance base is so much better at stopping a rush than the horde base is.
---
In a word: daze.
---
Lag
---
yep.
---
Some people will play same class they played in vanilla. Others who started later expansions will play same class as retail to see how it was. Me personaly I want to play something I never played before on retail or vanilla private servers.
---
First off, I'm assuming this isn't a full guild of people, which means that once it comes raiding time, you can just recruit MTs. You can play an Arms or Fury warrior while tanking every single 5man in the game for your friends just fine. Druid is also a fine option, although where Warrior lets you evolve into the dps role in raids, Druid raiding is going to either be healer or OT.
---
Ultimately though, play what you want. This game takes up a giant chunk of time, too much to let others dictate how you spend your gaming time.
---
Lol that´s bullshit. I agree that Classic will be a success but 10 Million is unrealistic. Vanilla hasn't had 10 Millions:

---
This is great! Shame I'll be playing Horde for the first time ever in Classic :( 
---
Do you have any recommendations for Horde guides?
---
they will wipe after the stress test so everyone will start at level 1 on launch day as far as I know. they have never allowed carryover in any past betas.
---
thread lacks auto mod replies.. gonna be hell to navigate the content. 
---
but since posting your own LF guild is frowned upon.
---
NA, PVP, Alliance preferred, priest looking for semi hardcore to casual guild
---
I work night shift and will able to raid weekdays anytime before 9pm (MST). 
---
I would like to clear MC within phase one and clear all other raid content shortly after being opened. I don't care what the loot system is as long as it is transparent. I don't intend to grind rank 14 but a black pvp mount would be dope. Hoping to find some lax folk with a sense of humor who intend to progress through raids. Ideally I'd like to push server first clears but it seems like a lot of more ambitious guilds are full or plan to raid at times ill be unavailable.
---
? No?
---
Pssshhh, you really think I'm blinking over there and frost novaing unless you include /y HEEELPPP WILL TANK FOR YOU
---
Tried on private server. Got my lock to 60, even raided BWL, still couldn't get used to it. Horde for life I guess. Zug zug
---
I doubt anyone ever claimed druids can't heal dungeons. Also druids are often much appreciated for dungeon tanking, but in some dungeons more so than others, which makes sense. They also make for great soaking tanks for specific raid encounters. 
---
"Hardcore" guilds will have druids in them. They're just unlikely to be played boomkin.

**Incarnation** \[A\] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council
---
Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously.
---
We have a solid core group and are looking to add a few more exceptional players to our roster. Our leadership core contains the following: multiple top 20 KT kills, Rank 14, multi season gladiators, complete private server progression, and competitive world rankings in other games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations. All the information is out there, such as boss mechanics and dps rotations. Even those new to classes/specs will be held to a high standard. We expect before applying you research and understand the basic mechanics and rotations of the class you're applying for.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We're currently fine tuning our raids weekly to ensure once launch comes we progress with minimal delay. Incarnation has an in house instant 60 server we use to ensure every member exceeds standards. We expect our members to be knowledgeable about each encounter and have adequate consumables available for progression.
---
Open: Rogues / Hunters / Warriors (fury) / Priests
---
Closed: Druids / Paladins / Mages / Warlocks
---
**Application:**

---
Off Schedule Plans: 45 Min Baron Runs, 20 Mans as interest persists, frequent trips to Tarren Mill/Southshore for World PvP, AV/WSG/AB Premades.
---
We will be selecting a server that has the LEAST populous amount of big name streamers on it.
---
Loot Distribution: A combination of DKP + Loot Council.

Default drops from bosses, such as Shadowstrike/Vendorstrike will use DKP. Legendaries, as well as specific class items, like the Eye of Divinity and Ancient Petrified Leaf, will use Loot Council. 
---
There will be weekly DKP drives for additional DKP, based on what materials for consumables the guild needs for the week (you should try to be self sufficient on your own, the guild will help in a pinch, but don’t make it a constant habit). 20 Man loot will not use DKP or Loot Council, without saying.

Someones getting a little heated.  That literally is hunter leveling, obviously the huntard doesnt just stand there and afk you dense turd.
---
For being "objectively the worst pvp class in vanilla by far" you sure get alot of whispers to join premades and the like. So if you want to do BGs you will still be in very high demand.
---
So you still get to play alot of PvP and it's quite fun.
---
I can attest that druid is not for everyone, but it can still be alot of fun and very rewarding.

John fucking Madden

Is like abusive marriage. I realize that old honor system is grindy and you have to collude with others and have no life byt still for some reason I look forward to it.

Thank you for this.

If in the US it releases on Monday the26th and it’s a global release how would it release in Germany on Wednesday or do you not understand how time works.

The badge gear started in TBC which was the start of "play the patch" gameplay. I'd rather they start with Classic and work their way from there than TBC. I'll concede TBC had better balance but flying mounts, daily quests, homogenized classes, and "e-sports" pvp balance started then too.
---
I wanna go do that for the wolf but I really don't care to play retail in general
---
1. Blizzard doesn't announce subscriber numbers
---
2. It's impossible to figure out who plays what since the subscription is shared.
---
So the whole discussion is pointless. Since it's obviously created just to shit on modern WoW it's even more pointless. Why can't we as a community just enjoy Classic without having to dump all over BfA in the process? It makes us look like moronic assholes.
---
I fucking LOVED single city AH's. It meant that Ironforge and Orgrimmar were PACKED and true, massive trade hubs.
---
It meant if you were in the southern part of the world you needed to plan and make the trip back to IF to get your items listed or to pick up something.
---
My literal biggest fear of Classic is that with the linked houses, IF will be dead.
---
This. The theme of Ironforge is enough for me to roll Alliance.
---
Some are (Onyxia, Vael, Nefarian), but many have mechanics that require you to taunt as one of the mechanics of the fight (Broodlord, Ebonroc in BWL).

If you hit spacebar while swimming, you jump.

Just out of curousity, what is your job?

Chaotic lol

It launches on a tuesday, target audience adults, 10 million on day one? no.

Map design. The ally bridge is a huge advantage.

This is why 4chan hates Reddit.
---
This
---
Like "Racism"
---
You could probably just pick at complete random and have a great time no matter what. IMO people are way overthinking it and it’s making the decision grueling. The thing about classes in Classic is that each one sucks in its own special way, so every time you land on a “decision”, you’re going to sit and think about the ways in which that class sucks until you switch and repeat the process. Personally the only class that isn’t fun for me is Warrior. Vanilla, retail, doesn’t matter, I can never seem to have fun playing that class.
---
Refuge Point in Arathi. Its a sunken hole in the ground where all the alliance peek their heads out like prairie dogs to see if the coast is clear, hated that place.

Asks for people to courage him to play alliance. ”They are bland and uninteresting”

Great job!

Feral druids also benefit massively from Paladin buffs, as opposed to Shaman totems where WF d
---
Well I consider it riduclous that people will roll need on epic BoEs because they "need" the money, when the reality is that's what greed is for and when you randomly circumvent the system it makes the system useless.
---
I also consider the recent rules from the BETA allowing grenades but not allowing potions. There's only a few logically consistent ways to do it. Either every consumable of every kind is allowed, or only consumables that are made by secondary professions, or no consumables at all.

&lt;One Up&gt; Semi-Hardcore NA-PVP Alliance

---
First rogues aren't exactly easy classes to solo with.  Secondly, play whatever makes you happy its not your responsibility to be your friend's tank.  Thirdly rolling a feral druid might satisfy all concerns.
---
A war told me that we had face each other at melee range and not move during dueling otherwise it was cheating (I was a drood).
---
How fun it can be to have your hand held all the time? 
---
I completely agree with the OP that the wild world you discover on  your own is way cooler than "go there, press this, kill that". But to each their own of course.
---
People telling me play at slow pace, dont rush 60 and min-max every aspect of game. Dude I want a lvl 60 in 5 days and play meme spec after.
---
Made me cringe for some reason
---
What was your keyword search? I've tried several and haven't had it come up yet. I think it may be because its a random comment on an Oceanic realms, so it's ranked very low for me (unless I include keywords like Oceanic which I would only know to use after I've already found the source). Or maybe you've found a different link with bluepost verification than the one I did.
---
Nothing will carry over, so for someone new to the game, it's definitely worth waiting until launch day to experience everything fresh for the first time.
---
You should log in next week for the character name reservation, though. Especially if you decide to roll a troll shaman named Thex
---
Youre right. For some reason i was thinking it was 27th in the US. Idk how i figured that out dince i asked for days off starting on the 27th
---
I can't attest to other servers.
---
I played Vanilla on Zul'jin, Pre-Nerf (original) AV
---
People would come and go from same AV battle that'd last for days/a ~week.
---
As the others said, the map is simply terrible.
---
You can kind of get around the disadvantage if you backdoor the alliance, but it requires a pretty difficult jump that few people can do.
---
I never said anything about being good or bad at the game, or about how much time a player should or shouldnt invest in the game. For many old players this game was the biggest time sink they ever experienced, and not all of them have entirely positive memories of that time, regardless of whether they were high end players or not. Some of my own friends fall in this camp, wherein they feel they shouldnt reinvest that much time into one game to the detriment of their lives or livlihoods. Denying that this game is a time sink is delusional, it doesnt matter if I rush toons to end game or take my sweet time, its a sink regardless.
---
Would love that! I tried to find but could only find some recent info from new interviews about classic that stated what I said
---
Stressed healers have to drink, that's my point.
---
I just want to comment on this about you calling them "dudus". I haven't heard this for 10 years and I still think it makes Druids sound like complete idiots.
---
So thanks, hahaha.
---
They are changing that so you can send multiple items.
---
Alliance has so much cooler capital cities, and the quest lores + zones are way better in design.
---
Haha fair Point! I love ruining my life with WoW too :P
---
But I gotta say that it is true that you didn't know the best tanks anymore really. But that was not only due to Dual-Spec. There were plenty cities in which different People would chill. Some would just fly around. Of course you didn't get to know the People very well anymore.
---
But if you needed a tank for Lich King 25 HC you would still not bring someone who quickly specced into Tank spec to tank the Lichking :P
---
It just sounded a bit extreme on the dual spec side. Today in classic you would also still know the best tanks on the Server because they'd have thunderfury and would still be the maintank in their raids. 
---
I think it is more due to the Expansion as a whole than due to dual-spec
---
Compared to the cesspool that is MMO-C forums Reddit and the Official forums look downright decent.
---
I wish videos like this would make a comeback.
---
THE ALLIANCE
---
every large poll I've looked at has warrior and mage as more popular class choices than rogue. Who knows if that will be the case, but pretty interesting nonetheless
---
Lol i saw it as well
---
What else could you possibly do to get faster honor?
---
HKs aren't a worthwhile source of honor in BGs, so you're down to bonus honor from objectives - which this "strategy" gets you as quickly as possible.
---
Drop bears are supposed to be fierce beasts who kill tourists all the time in Australia
---
I already know Azeroth better than my own city. You play your way and I’ll play mine. Sick of these posts.
---
By my research, the new 1-60 record will be somewhere in the area of 2.75 - 3 days
---
Yep, mage for sure. I need my portals.
---
Let people play the way they want. We don’t need another person telling people how to play because they think it’s the best way.
---
cant wait to kill some mages on my hunter
---
Ya I understand that but it just kept piling on and by mid end LK I just had enough. Res gear and wps got way out of hand, then to the others you pointed out. Flying mounts were the start of the fall but I understand why they did it. Then again maybe I just like the simplicity of classic with great content. At 34 I feel old school now and I am becoming my parents haha.
---
I hated this song back then and I hate it now.
---
Yeah these are getting old.
---
But without the world PvP it just doesn't feel right. You think I won't get my ass ganked? I will, but I will make sure I gank some of them back.
---
I want to play Shaman, my friends wants to go alliance. :'(
---
This is amazing! I love how well edited this is.
---
The song choices do date it; the evanescence at the end made me laugh. So edgy
---
The OP, LEM larpers and the responses here are brilliant
---
Not really. Earth (and let’s assume Azeroth) has constant gravitational pull on all objects. Yeah gravity is a relationship between the two objects’ mass and their distance, but we generally treat it as constant.
---
The gravitational pull exerted is a different (but related) phenomena from kinetic energy and momentum impulse. But yeah google math hurr durr.
---
Clicked on the video, still liked from 2006! Great vid
---
that's a fair point, even if I feel it's exaggerating a bit.  
---
Also, I don't understand how dual spec alleviated the need for good tanks and healers. If you were shit at playing either, dual spec did nothing to help you. Groups still needed good players, it's just that there was a bigger pool of players to pick from, because that great shaman player you knew wasn't stuck playing ele and could swap to resto to help you out.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Guild name has yet to be decided - looking for members to weigh in on this. We are new and looking for friendly, casual members who want to maximize enjoyment of WoW: Classic and build a reputation for themselves and the guild as a whole.
---
&lt;Undecided&gt; NA HORDE PvP - DKP - Casual
---
This is the *official* Thex and friends guild. Anyone is welcome to join up whether you're new, experienced, young, or old. We are founded off of the following beliefs.
---
"*Without the weakest link, we are unbound*"
---
Some may say that we are only as strong as the weakest link; I say, without the weakest link we are not even a chain. We will invite and accept heroes into our raiding parties even if they are unfit. We will give those otherwise excluded raiders a chance to flourish, and more importantly, a chance to grow stronger so that they may be excluded no more.
---
"*Alone we are strong, together we are mighty.*"
---
Members of the guild will stand not only with each other, but with each and every member of the Horde. When the treacherous dogs of the Alliance press an attack, we will defend. When a hero of the Horde is being camped and ganked, we will come to their aid. There is no task too small.
---
"*Before honor comes sympathy.*"
---
Even the enemy deserves compassion. There is no honor in camping. There is no honor in killing the weak. When we come across an enemy that poses no challenge, we will stand down. We will allow them to grow. We will allow them to flourish. Then, once they have been lifted to the rank of a worthy opponent, we will destroy them.
---
Our goal is to become a well known guild that strives to be excellent allies. Players outside of the guild should regard us as honorable, kind, helpful, and above all, stalwart defenders of the Horde and it's people. 
---
If this sounds like the type of guild for you, join up here: https://discord.gg/GpxTcjs.

Hence "so I've heard"
---
Looking for a Guild / Group of Players for US-East PVP Server.
---
I'm rolling NE Druid and would like to play in an RP PVP setting, preferably with other Night Elves, focused on leveling and world PVP. Maybe having a sister guild of Humans that can join together for raids.
---
Yessssssssssss!!!!! Thank you SO much 💕
---
The thing is the game was first designed with world PvP in mind. Without it is like taking a big part of the experience away. It's like removing professions just because.
---
I guess, by looking at the sub numbers, one could argue that the current state of the game is a, let's say, somewhat ruined version of a game that far more ppl enjoyed..
---
Alright thanks
---
While I agree with you, I also agree with the many people that feel like 10 million might be a bit overly optimistic.
---
That is a bugger.
---
Recently started playing WoW last week (never played vanilla or other xpans) and am enjoying it. The in-game communtiy as a low-level seems very polite, accommodating, and helpful to new players like myself. Can't speak on higher level parts of the game, pvp, etc. as I'm unfamiliar still. Reading online led me to believe WoW was more toxic than Runescape/OSRS, which may be--only because with a larger community comes larger groups of people, some great, some shitty.
---
Seems as if Warlocks are high in most polls too which is against vanilla and most private servers.
---
Time for new friends
---
Techno being the catch all term for Electronic music has fallen out of favor for EDM/Electronica.
---
Damn, I guess I'll have to get familiar with ElvUI before classic launch as I feel like I've been depending on pfUI for ages.
---
Gstta make the decision eventually!
---
I think we can all agree how silly that rule is
---
So gold grind at lvl 60 is no problem?
---
Warr tank/dps or ele/resto are both great in pvp. Druid hybrid is still bis flag runner.
---
Some suck, some don't Blizzard was pretty bad at viability design back then.
---
Would you have preferred I mislead the OP on an opinion or just ignore him outright?
---
Sometime in TBC, iirc, they added in a resources thing where the game ends after a certain amount of deaths on either side, so the game has more of an actual time limit.  
---
I believe tower captains were removed later on as well, but they are gone too. (but the generals get health &amp; damage buffs from the towers still)
---
Or if you are a warlock you will have to walk to every dungeon anyway and then beg the rest of your team to join so you can summon 2/4.
---
Tauren Priest would be dead set if it was a possibility.
---
**Pantheon** | NA PvP | Horde | US East/Central | Dedicated Raiding
---
Pantheon is a Horde guild that will be forming on a PvP server when WoW Classic goes live on August 27th, 2019. The core of our guild is a group of friends that have been playing MMO’s and various other games together since the early 2000’s. We’re looking for mature raiders that are willing to progress through all the content WoW Classic has to offer. Our primary focus will be on PvE/raiding, but if you’re mostly interested in PvP, there will be officers heavily involved in that as well.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Tuesday/Wednesday/Sunday - 8:30-11:30 EST (This is still being discussed)
---
We will be running dungeons, attunement chains, and any other quests to help everyone get pre-raid best in slot prior to raiding.
---
**Loot:**
---
We will be using a loot council system for raid gear that drops. In our opinion, loot council is the best way to gear a guild for progression through every raid tier. The loot council will contain the GM and all class officers. We will be using the following priority: Tanks -&gt; DPS/Heals. Please understand that you will not get gear every run; however, if you’re consistently raiding with the guild, you will be rewarded gear to help with our progression.
---
**Needs:** We have a solid core of 3 tanks and 5 healers. We're going to need DPS and a few more healers to complete our core group. Current roster sits at around 25. We plan on recruiting heavily once the game launches.
---
https://discord.gg/zajdVUg - There's a guild app in our discord. Post a message and we can talk.
---
IF is still the best place for general connectivity. It's faster to go to BRM from Ironforge (albeit potentially more dangerous), it's faster to go to Scholomance/Stratholme. Basically everything of vague importance in Kalimdor is closer to Darkshore or Theramore than to Ratchet. The only thing you lose out on is ZG.
---
Because classic is a good game by itself
---
Ive narrowed it down to just priest or warlock. It is so hard to choose.
---
Also one of the first I ever saw! Every time I hear that song now I always think of this video, and then of the girl I played WoW with who sent it to me. God, nostalgia is a beautiful thing
---
Personally, yes. Much more fun. I want to raid and do my job, and have everyone else do their job. I don't want to carry a bunch of people who die in fire, or fail on fights because DPS can't put out the throughput. That's not learning a fight. It's just grinding your dick in the sand.
---
If you are working hard to make your sub-optimal spec successful, and using every consume and really going to make a good impression and you have rogues forgetting poisons and healers without mana pots etc it isn't going to be fun. Losing 5g-20g in consumes every wipe because someone pulled threat on Vaelastrasz won't feel good.  
---
There is a lot of content to do besides MC. After a few phases it will be Ony, MC, BWL, and ZG every week, and I want to do SOME pvp. So no, I don't want to dick around in MC for 4 hours every week.
---
Was there even a concept of meta then or were people just figuring things out. How did it go on pservers
---
I would say I'm a natural facilitator as well then, seeing as I (practically always) fill to whatever the group needs (tank in MMOs, support/healer in MOBAs and Overwatch etc.).
---
And I like tanking, don't get me wrong, I would just love to play something that can do solo content instead/as well, which the warrior generally struggles with.
---
This was more of a little vent than anything else, and I know druid will be able to do all that I want in a class (Druid has also been my main since vanilla).
---
1-40 is the most boring leveling Ive ever done as a priest.
---
Remember you’re gonna have one phase release that’s just world bosses and dire maul. I think the honor system starts then too. No major raids though. You’ll have plenty of time for alts then. Mc should easily be on farm by then. It’s your time to do with what you will.
---
Ha.  Did that with my first toon.  Ergo hating runbacks.
---
Mid wrath is when I quit too. I feel ya.
---
Even 1 is definitely suboptimal.
---
agreed lol.  Priest will forever by my #1 class in my heart (vanilla main and still play same toon in retail) but I can't believe people level it with a fucking wand.
---
Glad I was like 12 y.o during vanilla psure I leveled as shadow and didn't care to drink between pulls lol
---
auto attacking is not my idea of fun
---
I have considered it tbh. At release and for 6 days straight Im playing with a warr and mage. Therefore at priest could boost our times so much compared to a warlock.
---
That’s on pvp servers. The one faction only thing is only on pvp servers.
---
Great story my dude, and I am happy to hear your friend realized it doesn't matter who you game with as long as it is with friends and for fun.
---
There will always be people buying, but for me, until i have the gold I need for my own mounts the Auction House will be for selling only.
---
Animations and lore are the most important in race choice to me. So Im with you about the racials.
---
According to the forum threads most likely sometime post launch. None of the authors have had beta access so their work has mostly been done through friends and/or stresstests. That's not enough time to get it all sorted out. I'd expect anything between a month and three though, depending on if they wanna level or code :P
---
I think if someone asks for encouragament on any matter, you either encourage them, or then dont say anything. But not discourage them. If someone asks for motivation to start playing guitar, you really dont want to tell him how guitar is a stupid instrument, and to go drums instead.
---
yes
---
Mmmmmm soul steak
---
as much as i'm a classic purist, 4HM was simply bad raid design. at no point in raiding history to that point (or since) did you need *8* tanks.... and we're not talking offtank just to hold threat, we're talking AQ geared tanks to swap.
---
guilds that had previously maybe 3-4 tanks suddenly had to equip and train 4 more warriors at the end of the expansion. 
---
it was stupidity.
---
Lol nice
---
Not in 1.12, they were already linked from earlier on - maybe 1.9?
---
Duskwood may be the single best questing zone in the game by a long shot. You owe it to yourself to at least level a character once through that zone just to experience Duskwood.
---
However be careful with your expectations coming from TBC as a paladin. Vanilla paladins are very different. Holy is still great, however the Prot and Ret are sad shades of what they become in TBC. The specs are still fun and can be played solo and in 5 mans, but both are very much meme fodder.
---
Thats actually a decent point. I might make a priest to level with my warrior friend and then have a warlock to play on solo, which will probably end up as my main.
---
Pick up skinning @ lvl 5 (or ASAP), and skin everything on your way to 40, vendoring it all (leather will be worthless on the AH at launch). Sell good greens (of the Bear, of the Tiger, of the Eagle) and BoE blues on the AH, and vendor the rest. Only buy the spells that are essential to your leveling rotation and skip the rest (for instance if your a mage you dont need rank 2, rank 3, etc frost nova; just rank 1. Buy every rank of Frost Bolt, but skip Arcane Missiles etc. If you're a priest don't buy rank 2/3 resurrect, rank 2/3 fear, etc, you'll only use rank 1 of each for leveling . Don't waste ur money on mind vision or mind control at all until at least lvl 40+.) Basically, research what spells you're actually going to use while questing, if you buy every single spell every 2 levels you will absolutely be broke as a joke by lvl 40.
---
Most important of all, DON'T BUY ANYTHING OFF OF ANYONE. EVER. 
---
Never buy something from the AH, or Trade Chat. Ever. Even if it's the biggest upgrade in the world, you'll eventually replace it. ONLY exception is buying a wand @ lvl 7-9 from an enchanter if you're a mage/lock/priest, and only if it's super cheaper (a few silver) and you can afford to. And ONLY because getting a wand asap is essential for questing/leveling.
---
Beside that niche scenario, never ever ever buy anything from another player ever. If you are smart about what spells to buy, never buy anything off trade/AH, are smart about selling BOE's in Trade/AH, and are skinning everything, you should have well over 100g by lvl 40.
---
Imagine that when someones calls for help, ennemies panic and run around... All generals throughout history would have put cowards in the frontline...
---
WHAT
---
STV is where the PVPers, Redrigde is where the gankers go. The reference is that Whitegrape spent his last year ganking in Redridge on pservers.
---
Wouldn't that just be the Nickleback discography on shuffle?
---
I know, and I do plan to play on PvP realms.
---
I can see both ways.  It was one of those things that made it less where I needed to grind gold to do 50g respecs.  But also having that identity tied to your spec was nice as well.  
---
Was part of the reason my priest alt in vanilla was a holy fire spec'd priest.  That way I could do healing when needed and throw a few holy fire/smite nukes when I wanted to for fun in PvP.
---
In WotLK, I was playing a Shadow priest main but did healing when needed and it was nice to have the two specs.  Same when I was playing a Paladin in Cata/WoD and was dancing between a heal/dps or heal/tank spec.
---
No they don't
---
Or maybe don't tell people what to do and just let people enjoy the game the way they want to.
---
lucky for me i got a good posse to level with! Hunter+priest included gonna be some fun world pvp :)
---
Despite some of these things still being in Retail, it just isn't unique or flavor anymore.
---
On retail EVERYONE can Hearth then tele anywhere
---
Druid for a while could blink in cat
---
Soul shards removed
---
Ammo removed
---
Pet system gutted
---
Everyone has the same sorts of defensives, offensives, mobitility, aoe CC, immunity / save ability (Like ice block)
---
No class quests (Except for Legion, which were great IMO)
---
Pockpicking and poison professions removed
---
As much as I love wotlk I believe it is when classes started to do the same things. It was the beginning of class homogenization
---
If Bagnon uses in game textures to create it’s frames then yes, otherwise Bagnon will use it’s own graphics. It’s possible to create parts for other mods so they have the same look, but I haven’t decided if I am going to go down that rabbit hole just yet.
---
Same for some of us on the Alliance.

Gotcha

I remember people in vanilla knowing which graveyards to grab and not to grab, in order to prevent turtles - so they definitely had some sort of established meta.
---
But the all-out rush definitely wasn't developed yet - I think people just realized it was possible after it started happening in modern versions of AV.
---
On pservers, you either get regular rush games which are the fastest source of honor for a solo player, or you get games where mostly chinese premades turtle to punish bracket breakers, or to stall someone's honor.
---
There’s going to be wayyyyyyyy more people than they think. They will be adding a lot of servers if there’s only 5 PvP ROFL

---
If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch with us!
---
I’m gonna be controversial and say class balance. 
---
I really enjoyed/enjoy how Vanilla feels to play but it sucks that we have to play through the wonky class balance without any minor buffs to the weak classes to at least make them viable or a bit more fun to play.
---
Good ol classic cringe
---
You should really just go Horde, where you belong.
---
People are going to do what they want. If you're taking a reddit post as instruction as opposed to opinion you've got some deep seated issues.
---
There will more than likely be more than one of each type of realm. Even with layering everyone uses the same chat channel. If we were all forced on one server the chat would scroll by faster than if asmongold used rogain on stream.
---
What's on your pros/cons list for each?
---
Paladins having zero range and almost no offensive attacks except stuns and seals. You end up just auto swinging at people, bubbling and out healing them. Least fun class to play ever.
---
Best present I never knew i wanted. I didn’t even find out about classic until June
---
Exactly this.  With HotW being the most OP talent in the game, you really dont even need a tank set of gear to tank.  You can easily tank lvl 60 dungeons in your resto set with this build.
---
Playing this now, reminded me of so many songs that would pop up on Pandora back in the day! Good job. 
---
If we can make recommendations, Tiesto - Forever Today, ever since seeing the 3-man UBRS with Fratley that was my #1 song for killing trash during raids
---
Not really accurate.
---
Hybrid specs or changing specs in general, dailies, much more gold entering the economy reliably in TBC and sinks are less impactful, FLYING which literally changed how the game was played and made many activities kind of meaningless or changed the way they had to be done and thus Blizz focused on them less (World bosses, world farming, Wpvp to assert dominance over resources not just for fun, etc.)
---
The lowered raid sizes also were a huge difference as well as the relative tightening up of certain quirks in Vanilla meaning that farming consumables/buffs or bringing certain classes/buffs are less meaningful or not relevant anymore. Also in TBC you had to be better to find a raiding spot as a result, (although the community really improved at the game so more people raided anyway and gold etc. wasn't such an issue for raiding).
---
Hmm, what about the need to buy ammo, for you hunters in particular.  This was always aggravating to me.
---
Unless they have a gun to your head you should probably just play what you want?
---
Two hours a day is what I anticipate having to spare.  /shrug
---
Double edged sword for me cus have to neglect friends and gf etc if i want to play launch. Still gunna do it tho xD
---
Yup, specially when you find that pros and cons balance themselves
---
I'd be open to dual spec if it cost something non-trivial like 1000g to unlock.
---
Rogues can pick scholo.
---
Thx luv ^^
---
Yes, played warrior in classic but mostly did pvp, rolled mage in tbc and played it till legion, that's where the problems started. We were 5 people with a weird double mage setup, and mage was dogshit at the beginning of legion (pre legendary, like first week beginning), so i said fuck it and rerolled blood dk. Best decision i've made in wow, Tanking is ez to learn and really amazing once you master it. You can control your group like npc's, you can really push for fast cleartimes if you know how much tanking you can handle etc. Always ez to find groups and you're almost impossible to kill. Sadly bfa was dogshit and blood dk was utterly gutted and mindnubingly boring to play so i quit after like a month. Came back to play demonhunter(Havoc)  and it's always the same, wait for tank, tank is dogshit, look for new tank, tank is reading dungeon journal inbetween pull or is polishing his sword (if you know what i mean). Can't really go back to playing anything other than tank because i get triggered just watching people being so dogshit at tanking when i know it's so fucking ez. Really a shame blizzard made tanking in raids so goddamn braindead and boring.
---
BUT i'm not going to roll tank in classic because noone wants tank. IDC, classic is only going to Re-release ONCE and i'm not wasting my precious time. If i have to i'm going to tank with my fucking mage. FUCK EM
---
Yeah, I had a ?? human paladin help me with a couple of mobs yesterday even. Definitely the exception in my experience, though.
---
Sprint and vanish.
---
I think its suppose to be two 60s fighting and a dude actually trying to level wanders in and gets caught up in the fight.
---
Really, that's just in raids.  Everyone has this raid meta mentality and make it like it spills over into the rest of the game.  Sure, even in 5 man content, some hybrids might not be meta, but they're more than viable.  
---
I think going into classic, I'm going to be a bit more accepting in 5 man, and even 20 man raid content, to bring in any of the meme hybrid specs like Balance/Feral DPS, Shadow Priest (although I'd be fine with one slot in a raid), Ret paladin, hell I'd be willing to try prot pally as well.
---
The issue with raids, it's more of a "team player" aspect.  I'm sure a bunch of warriors would rather go PvP arms spec and rogues be assassination daggers, etc.  But I'm sure you'll find guilds that are fine with people running non meta specs, and a min/max hybrid will be able to compete with those people.
---
I knew what it was from the thumbnail. I cried the first time I saw this.
---
Theres addons for this if they dont make this a native feature in Classic.
---
Black lotus spawn timer. Over 50% of my play time will be dedicated to farming for flasks. I wouldn't mind them being 10% of their price, giving me more time to do other things.
---
There were mods to send multiple items.
---
You can duo level as a prot pally (that takes some other talents and respecs slightly at 60 ofc.) There are many combination possible.
---
But otherwise I wouldn't level solo as prot. That's just me though.
---
dont blink near the grates dont blink near the grates dont blink near the grates dont blink near the grates
---
ah fuck i blinked near the grates
---
Didn't necessarily mean soloing dungeons or elite monsters per say, just a class that is fun to play both when you feel like grouping for dungeons or the like, and when you just want to run around solo making some gold, leveling professions or partaking in world PVP.
---
Warrior for example usually needs to be grouped with a pocket healer for world pvp and gold making.
---
This is also, as you say, why I'm sticking with druid.
---
I mean anyone can grind up to 50+ and assblast every grey enemy in stranglethornistan
---
Same! I’m just gonna celebrate early and if the servers go down at launch it’ll give me an excused to drink away my problems
---
If they get a lucky crit string on a fresh 60 or so, they can easily "1-shot" (assuming they have goodish gear).   
---
You are correct though, typically they will have to do work in order to kill someone of equal or greater gear.
---
If Bagnon/OneBag uses in game textures to create it’s frames then yes, otherwise They will use their own graphics. It’s possible to create parts for other mods so they have the same look, but I haven’t decided if I am going to go down that rabbit hole just yet.
---
Still not fully sure. It’ll more than likely be between just the hunter and shaman. Kind of leaning towards hunter. Couple more weeks to decide.
---
I’ve never liked priest tbh
---
It is, but only one, and the guild needs to understand and support that.  Also, as a raid Shadow Priest, you need to understand what are your gear priority lists.  You won't get a tear before mages/warlocks, just like other a bunch of other items.  You really don't start getting decent gear until Phase 3 and for phase 1 and 2 you might be sitting back with little to no upgrades.
---
Can’t speak from anything but my own experience, but I definitely also remember getting into the save AV multiple days in a row
---
I just want dual spec where you have to go to a trainer and it has like an 8-12hr cooldown to do again.
---
When I was on Darrowshire Horde had so many hardcore pvpers that even when pugging they would carry and always win. Usually a few dedicated mage/rogues stayed behind and held them off. Occasionally at the first horde GY Horde could setup a devastating chokepoint. If we were losing we could wall jump into the back of the Alliance base.
---
!remindme 5days
---
I can't get the third mouse button to work on mine. (far right)
---
Diablo 2 had respecs in later patches.
---
***LOK'TAR OGAR!***
---
In fairness, plenty did play vanilla at like 13-14. I was 19 when it came out, and it wasn't longer after my friends and I were all playing that everyone's little brothers were as well. I remember kids as young as 11 and 12 going to our local internet café to play WoW.
---
Lol I just do a Line and I’m good to go
---
Nah just no rez isn't a lot of fun in dungeons is all. I know Druids have their place especially if they will heal.
---
Taking three weeks off work for launch, haven't done much else aside from look up some addons, hoping I'll get most of the things I want done in the time I'm taking off
---
No summoning stones at dungeons and/or amount of time just to start a dungeon 
---
I buy into the large world / immersion argument but waiting 15 minutes for little jimmy because his mom wants him to carry in the groceries really pisses me off.  getting to the dungeon with a full group is half the battle and with not much time to play I don't think I'll be able to enjoy dungeons as much as I used to
---
I was typing all this on my phone and then by mistake deleted it all. 2nd try.
---
Congratulations. You've taken a step towards a higher level in MMOs. I am not an expert on macros but I do consider myself an enthusiast/expert on keybinding. You do not have to do this as in depth as I do, but perhaps you might want to later or more likely do a more simple, condensed variant.
---
WoW Classic was from an era where depending on the class and level of dedication had a lot of abilities that needed to be keybound. Think every ability that you would need to press quickly or use in combat (including multiple ranks of some spells for better mana effecincy), every item that you might want to activate including equipable trinkets and engineering armor, potions, engineering items (iron greneade), potions which had a 2 min cd unaffected by combat status (free action potion, invisibility potion, invulnerability potion, health potion, mana potion), tab target button, jump, auto run and you can understand why the statement that depending on class dedicated vanilla wow players needed 50 - 80 keybinds. Some classes that use macros to do different things with each of those abilities, like use that ability on 4 of their arena partners (not till tbc), 5 arena enemies, their focus target (tbc or wotlk, not sure), and macros to do certain things that normally take multiple key presses into a single key press like /invite    or  /trade   . The need for more buttons that you can press quickly without giving yourself carpel tunnel syndrome or RSI in the long term is mandatory for dedicated mmo players. 
---
**#1 rule is to be patient in learning how to press the side buttons without looking at them.** At first it will be difficult to get used to but after about 1-2 weeks you should be back to your previous performance and it'll only go through the roof from there. 
---
Now how to setup all of this
---
1st step is to use the Logitech software to map keys to the side buttons of the mouse. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuxuhnYezng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuxuhnYezng) In this video @ 4:27 He shows how to map a key to one of the mouse buttons including the side mouse buttons. I recommend mapping the following keys to the the following mouse side buttons. G9 is 1.  G10 is 2.   G11 is 3.   G12 is 4.    G13 is 5.    G14 is 6.   G15 is 7.   G16 is 8.    G17 is 9.   G18 is 0.   G 19 is - (minus to the right of 0).    G20 is =.   Think of it like an 12 button phone number pad on turned 90 degrees counter clockwise. If you want you can assign the buttons below the scroll wheel to other things.
---
2nd step is to assign keybinds to action bar slots inside World of Warcraft. As of the date of this post WoW Classic isn't out yet so you'll just have to practice with regular wow or some other game that lets you change keybinds. Enable however many action bar slots you wish to use inside the settings menu. I use all 10 action bar slots.  Then inside the keybindings settings assign each action bar slot a keybind. For example Action Bar slot 1 on Bar 1 could be the 1 key. The action Bar slot 2 on Bar 1 could be the 2 key. The action bar slot 1 and Bar 2 could be Shift 1. Once you're convinced you've keybound enough slots it is time to move to step 3.
---
3rd step is to click and drag abilities/spells/activated items from your spellbook, macro menu and bags to the action bar slot. . I do recommend placing abilities/spells that you associate with each other on adjacent numbers or on the same number but a different modifier. As a Holy Paladin I have Blessings grouped together, auras together, seals together, defensive cds together, potions together. I also recommend prioritizing abilities instant abilites, cd abilities, or things that you use WHILE you're moving on the mouse side buttons. That way you can move with wasd and use those movement abilities simultaneously. If you put those movement abilities on a key like say the F key, then it makes it difficult to strafe right because you can't press F and your strafe right key simultaneously. 
---
Don't get discouraged in your trek to taking WoW Classic to the next level. Good luck!
---
I truly feel sorry for you
---
It's gonnna be pretty great :) We'll have the older, mostly I think, spell power scaling to goof around with on certain class abilities or enchants too. Should be a lot of fun.
---
Because I certainly was alt tabbing through online guides 15 yrs ago.  /s
---
Another cringey post about "take it slow guys and have fun. But have fun my way! Play slow i said! No rushing because this is the only way to have fun".
---
Ok buddy
---
It's for a 15 year Anniversary event, isn't it?
---
RemindMe! 5days
---
Debuff limit?
---
Works on mine and is bound to g-shift. Could be a dodgy microswitch?
---
Warriors are one of two classes that can reduce healing in a target, and the only one that can do it without taking up a limited slot on their weapon to do so. That's pretty flavourful.
---
mage is too high, especially for a fresh
---
WTB 2nd monitor so I can have this up while I level
---
Im unfamiliar with how AV is post TBC, but I can tell you that its an absolute shit fest in TBC. They nerfed it so hard there is absolutely no challenging rushing to the end bosses. No fights happen in the middle.
---
Horde towers can be easier to defend with the right classes.
---
I thought about it but no, only reason is to get the epic chest, which tbf the robe dropped from Baron in strat is good enough. Planning to go full T2 eventually.
---
Yea it looks awesome I play it in 1440 2K runs like a boss
---
uh oh.  MMO Champ spreading the fake news.  Can't wait for the forum freakouts in November
---
My job
---
The custom on my classic server was for everyone to roll Need on BoE items and to Pass on BoP items (then /roll for it) in dungeons.
---
Not just Vanilla, but the obsession that I had built up over the years with wow inevitably caused me to drive my ex wife to leave. 
---
I basically became so enthralled with the game that I had "grown up" with that I found myself subconsciously waking up early and going down to the computer room. I would be so wrapped up in a task in-game that I would lose track of time or not even know she had come down to bring me dinner. It was a big point of contention, I attempted to get her into the game, which really was just a masked attempt to have my play time "approved of" since she would be playing as well. I found myself doing nice things for her in preparation for a long weekend of play, 14+ hours a day. The shittiest thing I think I ever did was race home after a full 9am-5pm day, run in the door throw my shoes off and sit down at the PC because "raid started in 10 minutes". I'm honestly shocked she didn't leave me that day.
---
Never considered myself to have an addictive personality, don't smoke/ rarely drink, but the addiction I had to Wow in its infancy was a very real thing. I chose to do a lot of things I'm not proud of, but I think I've made steps in the right direction since then. 
---
**TLDR: I'm a POS and chose WoW over my wife and got a divorce.**
---
I'll roll alliance too because my friends will be alliance (one of them only play paladin)
---
You all roll Need on BoEs so nobody can cheat the roll.
---
I feel that issue was resolved mailing to a bank alt in IF to list your items.
---
Ironforge and Stormwind are so close though, it's not that terrible.  But I still think IF has the tip in popularity.  Mainly because you're closest to level 60 instances compared to Stormwind.  Dueling is less of a jog as well outside and in a perfect area.  The city layout is just better as well with the ring and central hub.
---
It's still an instruction even if people don't follow them. Stop trying to sound smart.
---
Ahh i think im realizing What My mistake was! Im guessing theres an addon to show the threat-meter which would enable you to not accidentially pull Aggro from the mob the tank is focusing because of high dps ?

**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team (Hardcore): Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team (Semi-Hardcore): Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST

Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
**What you can expect from us:**
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 1 Extremely Talented Dwarf Priest, 1-2 Warlocks, 1-2 Fury Warriors
---
Team 2 1 Experienced Resto Druid
---
Team 3 Looking for a guild or group of individuals to kick-start and lead this team!
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
I am aiming for Main Tank role. I have never felt so dedicated... Just need to find a Guild without MT spot taken. Feels impossible.
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
Yeah, you get the ocassional squad of good players that can result in a horde win, but even then it's usually a question of running past each other with a few recalls to slow allies down.
---
If it takes an hour to win, it's likely worse honor than losing in 20-25 mins.
---
Understood. I have it the other way though. I loved playing with my guild and helping them out way more than I loved being pestered by whispers from randoms after logon. I had a warrior main and a very well equipped resto shaman alt. I loved that any time my guild mates needed a +1 I was able to join them regardless of the role they were searching for. What I chose to define myself as a player was the guy you can count on for help with whatever. The person that was almost always there, ready and willing.   
---
I'm not suggesting your RPG preferences are worse btw, or anything like that. It's just.. to each his own. And I'm sorry blizzard went with encouraging a different playstyle.
---
This. I know a lot of retail players who want to play classing alongside BFA. I've seen nothing but classic fans bashing BFA.
---
The auction houses were linked in 1.9, so we will have that in classic.
---
From tbc but nyhm has always been a fav
---
Same in 1.12. The original version may have been overturned a bit leading to 3 day long games going nowhere, the but 1.12 version is just awful. Screw #nochanges, AV needs some love.
---
I think that's a fair point, but there's a limit on the punishment.
---
Modern wow has so many graveyards but honestly who even dies in modern wow to PVE?
---
Warcraft Lore post Wrath is a complete clusterfuck. TWO DRAENORS LOL.
---
#1 is the specs, it's a great game but a lot of the specs are bollocks. TBC fixed most of those issues.
---
Runner-up would probably be the pvp rank system, it's a terribly designed thing that literally just rewards whoever no-lifes the hardest. That said I'll still probably be pvp'ing a lot :)
---
For my first classes I'm forcing myself to do things I never did in vanilla. I always wanted a warlock, so that's what I'm rolling with my friends. Then for solo I'm thinking a rogue or warrior.
---
Lvl 60 Orc hunter with Rhok'Delar.
---
I've tried a bunch of guides on a hunter and I always feel like grinding after getting a pet is the fastest. There's probably less money on that though and maybe you suffer from crappier gear. Not sure, but it sure seems faster.
---
Show me at least 20 logs that have hunters at the top 2 for MC and BWL.
---
Yeah, went from 18 hr+ (++++) games to 10 minute rush fests.
---
Take skinning and herbalism. Mining would work too but I prefer skinning because it synergizes well with your leveling, you're gonna be killing monsters anyway. 
---
That said, I'm a warlock so I dont need gold for my level 40 mount but it's always good to start saving for the epic mount and respeccing at end game, things like that.
---
Right, food! Why hadn't I thought of that
---
I just want my titles back.
---
Take it Easy Tiesto
---
People are literally aoe grinding as 3/4 mage + healer in beta with shit gear when the mobs are 1-2 levels above them. Classic dungeons are not as hard, especially the low lvl ones. People were just really bad and had shit computers/internet to boot.
---
Now later raids and high level dungeons etc. might be different, we are not sure.
---
Anyway, it won't be like live with facerolling to the end with infinite health and mana regen and no worry about threat but it can be done much faster/crisper than the method of individual planned pull &gt; drink/eat, repeat. You can semi-chain the pulls etc.
---
Dun Morogh in general tbh. And this is coming from a horde player.
---
It’s not losing the class identity because the tank classes are tanking and heal classes are healing, it just opens up more flexibility.  It sounds like you enjoy being sought after for sticking with a tank spec and that was lost and people no longer flocked to you.  
---
I think even with dual spec you would still be known for how well you perform roles, but with no cross realm you will shine and be known if you’re spectacular.
---
Do what you feel is necessary but I will emphasis, **if you are Raid Tanking at all**, you need a minimum of 3800 Mana to realistically spam Consecrate and Holy Shields on CD (and Judge if someone is approach your threat while these are on CD). This requires a Flask of Distilled Wisdom.  
---
If you are just an add tank, and then plan to heal after your add is dead, you will already have a decent amount of Int equipped, then the flask will not be necessary.
---
I get the point but
---
1. the reputation was there
---
2. I think the time it came out does play a part in the difficulty of the raid. But relatively to that, Naxx was bonebreaking. I mean relative to the experience level of players/time it came out and stuff like that. With these factors, Naxx was incredibly hard and even people in TBC had to put in effort to clear it.
---
But even without these factors OG Naxx is hard. Certainly harder than WotlK Naxx. The latter was a joke. Really. There is no way in fucking hell that I got that much better till WotlK that I could've stepped into OG Naxx and cleared it in 1 or 2 IDs.
---
Like we weren't even BiS when we did WotlK Naxx. Didn't outgear or outlevel it ... heck we got server first (not the biggest server). And while the latter may be a testament to the fact that I maybe just don't suck, it went way too smoothly. I refuse to believe that our raid was just THAT good that we might have as well breezed through OG Naxx like this. Am I THAT deluded about this?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
When we did Karazhan for the first time (different group, equally skilled) we also cleared the whole thing minus Malzahar the first night (Malzahar bugged and was stuck in P3, so that any further attempts required us to do P3 for the entire fight. We almost got him but fuck I am salty about this...) but that didn't feel like we breezed through it! We fought hard that night and really felt like we were great players clearing tough content skillfully. With Naxx, however... it was just easy. It didn't feel like we cleared it so fast because we were such immensely skillful dudes, but because the raid was piss easy. While it is not entirely impossible, I'm having a very hard time believing that when I step into Naxx a couple months from now I will just breeze through it. That would certainly shatter my perception of that raid.
---
if they released the AV before classic came out then id be excited but its not gonna start until Nov 15th so everyone will be playing vanilla by that point and I can't see people logging into retail to play a BG that they will get at some point anyway.
---
I've played Hunter during Vanilla, and hunter on pservers. So the only logical choice is to play hunter again in Classic. Which I will, the only change is the race. From Troll(male) to Orc(female).
---
Not all random enchantment items can have all the suffixes. For example, many can't have "of the Tiger" and only a few can have "of Striking". Sometimes an item can only have a handful of suffixes, like the Astral Guard, which only ever rolls "of Blocking" or "of Defense".
---
Didn't play WoW vanilla much, but aren't warriors the only real viable tank, and aren't they simultaneously the most played (or one of the most played) classes?
---
Your assumption is wrong.
---
I can't click it, i might gonna cry
---
Please update this post with names, faction and server so i can make sure i dont accidentally do a dungeon with you or god forbid, raid with you
---
But the classic version won't be the same as this one, tho. Unfortunately
---
Well i'm gonna be around Ironforge alot. Playing undead mage.
---
No guild yet, im rolling with 5-10 friends though so we plan to make a guild meaning im in the rare position where I have a larger number of people willing to make it work.  
---
Without that in place, realistically OT might be ambitious and id be look at a 3rd tanking position at most until i proved myself.
---
The longer the better. If you want to win, make a premade. You could have 3 rogues over turn an entire battle if they all nuke the healers with tripple ambush -&gt; vanish.
---
&gt; As much as I love wotlk I believe it is when classes started to do the same things. It was the beginning of class homogenization
---
I think that was Cata: most DPS classes got the combo points system instead of being around CDs or something else, like Ret with holy power, SP, Lock etc. 
---
Also there were much more homogenization with spells/abilities in Cata than WOTLK, like Ret got their kick (rebuke).
---
the thread says most hated aspect of vanilla..
---
Play what you want. You could even do duo mages, duo rogues, duo pallys etc if thats what you both want to play.
---
I've seen a lock tanking strat
---
I agree and concur
---
You're remembering right, at least according to Urban Dictionary. But it got much more popular when Blizz added it to WoW, apparently.
---
Only one match will be played, dont worry you'll have 7 or 8 days to check it out.
---
Anyone who thinks classic will have two million players, much less ten million, is mentally deficient.
---
&gt; I always thought it'd be cool if there was a major beloved character who died and later came back as undead.Undead Mankrik's Wife?
---
Mods here really need to step up their game and get rid of garbage like this.
---
Yep, 1.12 warriors is a huge gaping hole in classic. It wasn't always this way, they were fine up till 1.9. Too bad we're getting the worst version of vanilla.
---
Suboptimal? Yes, but having 1 is definetly viable.
---
One needs to realize that Patchwerk is the hardest enrage ingame and requires 500 DPS, something that Feral can beat 2x with optimal DPS, consumables and Worldbuffs. Take WBs away and you'll still be fine I'm pretty sure, on top of providing Leader of the pack for your group.
---
Definitely not a "copy paste". It's likely most of the scripting had to be fixed.
---
&lt;One Night Stand&gt; Alliance | NA PVP| One Night Raiding!

---
What to expect?
---
Organized and competent one night a week raiding as well as the social aspects that come with a guild (PVP/Dungeons/Other games/etc). We expect competence but are not going to force you to min/max and recognize who we are.
---
Raid times?
---
Day TBD (Likely Sunday, Tuesday, or Thursday)
---
3 hours of raiding
---
Needs:
---
All players who match our approach to the game and desire to clear content while maintaining our IRL commitments are welcome; currently class wise:
---
    - Warrior (Prot): High
---
    - Warrior (DPS): Medium
---
    - Mage: Low
---
    - Warlock: Medium
---
    - Druid (Resto): High
---
    - Druid (DPS/Offtank): Medium
---
    - Paladin: High
---
    - Hunter: High
---
    - Rogue: High
---
    - Priest: High

What we expect from you? 
---
- Attendance for that 1 night a week, we get things come up, but 90+ for a full time slot is expected!
---
- 60 within 2-3 months of launch
---
- Maturity, we're cool so we want you to be cool
---
If interested, check out our discord and hang out a bit before launch!

---
good player /= good tank. It's an identity thing
---
Yes. This was the funniest thing back in the day. My friends and I would sing it all the time in middle school.
---
&gt;Unironically using the word 'toxic' is toxic
---
Unless that warrior is leveling for like, 15+ hours a day 7 days a week uncontested then that warrior is not taking 2 weeks to hit 60 lol. But yes the balance is horrid, and Warrior has weaknesses like any other class. Soloing anything for them is rough, especially 1v1 PvP without FAP
---
Unfortunately I've been to exposed to information on classic through YouTube, Google and F5ing this subreddit. But I will be taking my time, running dungeons to practice tanking and helping people out whenever it's needed. 
---
However, I do have some friends that will be trying out the game for the first time. I'll be witholding any important information unless they ask for it and even then I won't be super in depth. The only thing I provided was the vanilla flavors videos of the classes.
---
My fondest memories of RuneScape was when I was a noob and had no idea what I was doing. Getting lost, grinding out skills in inefficient ways and just goofing around. Once the notion of efficiency came into my head I lost full enjoyment and it became a chore.
---
This is a true piece of art.
---
Yeah but that patch was released 9 years later by modern Blizzard. For the time period in which 99% of players were active, it wasn't a thing.
---
The first step should be deciding what role you want to play, tank/dps/healer, then figure out what class best fits your style from there.
---
No it’s not.
---
Oof.
---
No. Because the creators of the sport do not supply it with a programmable interface to implement steroïds with.......... kind of a big difference.
---
Was drops from Andariel, Meph, Diablo and Baal. Quite easy to farm up, so you had infinite respecs.
---
I think most guilds are running LC this time around. But I'm sure there will be addons available specifically for DKP management.
---
i've noticed that the best games put limitations on players.  years back i had a friend who said dota was boring compared to LoL because for the first 10 mins you only had enough mana to cast like 1-5 spells... sure you aren't pressing as many buttons but your usage of those spells becomes so much more thought-out and impactful.  it forces more cooperation and timing, it forces the mini-game of trying to slowly chip your opponent down into a weakened position, it forces you to try and bait them or maneuovre them somewhere where they are exposed.  If your abilities were cheap and you could spam them, then they have to be nerfed to have less effect and they become totally unsatisfying.
---
just like in WoW, having the ability to ice block and blink is incredible, but you are forced to kite a lot and counterspell wisely in order to survive against certain things.  this adds so much flavour and playstyle
---
gold grinding at 60 when heal specced is mostly done through running 5 mans, like strat live for the orbs. find a good tank and just grind the orbs, once the run is over just find a new set of DPS-ers which never takes too long. tanks also have shitty solo gold grinding so a lot of them resort to either orb runs or tanking any dungeon for a set amount of gold
---
i think you could also do some AoE farming in dire maul but i'm not 100% sure
---
Deadass this straight belongs in the library of Congress
---
I'm excited for Classic as much as the next guy my dude, but you're delusional if you think Classic will have a larger population than Retail 6 months down the road.
---
If you are a toxic asshole you will end up being black listed by the community and have to only group with toxic assholes. 
---
You can only group with players on your server and if you do it early on, you will not have that many options since majority will still be leveling. So you’d be screwing yourself.
---
That’s the beauty of classic wow.
---
Same here, except for the dad part. I’m gonna have to meet some people to play with.
---
Thanks for answers guys, really helps, almoat everyone seems to agree 0/30/21 is the way to go, but what talents are extra important for this? (no idea about druids in classic) i guess improved mark of wild is a must, and also the extra armor in feral would be good, since it would also benefit me if i get aggro when healing.
---
Orc stun resist. Literally the only reason making me reconsider going ally. Its such an insane ability no other racial even comes close to it.
---
Joana's record will be destroyed in Classic. I suspect someone somewhere will somehow hit 60 in under 72 hours.
---
I've been hoping that Classic gets special events over time, e.g. bringing back the original version of corrupted blood for a week, bringing back the unkilled pre-nerf C'thun for a week, bringing back 1.5 AV for a week. I think that'd be fun.
---
Team with the most epic mounts wins!
---
Here's one of the first ones I remember.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkmI2yRJwgc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkmI2yRJwgc)
---
No problem! (I love it because that way, I can visualize which button to mash in a pinch)
---
I know that there's a discrepancy between theory and practice but I'd still err towards thinking that it's better to have maybe half the healers heal till they are OOM and then swap with healers who have been wanding/meleeing.
---
Of course the healers who are actually healing shouldn't overheal or have people drop too low. So their healing-uptime will be a lot longer than spamming max-rank.
---
I think it also would be a more engaging way for healers to play. Most of the time a lot fewer healers would be enough to generate the needed throughput. But that way they'd go oom and couldn't deal with huge spikes.
---
But putting them all into an uncoordinated whack-a-mole-contest where the best way to show their skill is how good they can cancel to avoid overhealing, seems counter-productive.
---
Have you ever heard of the trick for when you can't decide between 2 things. You toss a coin for it but as soon as you see the result your initial reaction will either disappointed or satisfied and you'll know what you really want without the overthinking getting in the way.
---
You're left with 5 choices, 4 if you know which faction you want. Get a 6 sided die or something (e.g. random generator), assign 1-4 (or 5) to a class with the left over numbers being rerolls. Roll the die and play the class that shows up, but if you feel a bit of disappointment it the outcome then you probably didn't want to play that class that class in the end
---
Yes people using the word toxic is what’s wrong with the world. Not politicians giving no shits about people or the planet, not psychos killing innocent by standards, not global warming, not the crimes against humanity going on, Riot Lyte and people who used the word toxic after him the problem.
---
So you're telling me all the Hordies out there will be happy to spread their cheeks and accept the fact that every AV will be a de facto loss where all they can do is scrape up a few HKs to make it all worth it....
---
Nah, I dont see any reason for the meta to change
---
Wasnt trying to be smug my friend, just pointing out how physics works.  My point is holes are not the reason kites work, they would actually diminish the functionality of the kite.  But here we are arguing pointlessly about kites in a thread about classic wow. Cant wait till the game comes out and I can just gank you in game.  Prolly alliance a bet eh
---
Link?
---
By your description I already knew it was that video before clicking it hahaha
---
Are you kidding me more than one? There will be at least 15 PvP servers US alone. I mean if not they are severely underestimating this launch and it’s going to be a cluster fck at launch cause there’s going to be 5 mill plus easyyyy on launch.

---
**Raid Times**:  Tue/Thu 7 - ~1030pm PST
---
**Loot System**: Loot Council + (Guild Website explains everything). [We have our own real time loot tracking backend system](https://gfycat.com/goodnaturedscrawnyasiaticgreaterfreshwaterclam) to allow our loot council to make consistently fair decisions when disbursing loot. 
---
**About us**: Traffic is a guild geared towards the working adult that favors a west coast evening starting time.  Current foundation is comprised of experience high end raiders that cleared all content from Classic, TBC, and WotLK.  We plan on clearing everything in classic, while fostering a culture of transparency and fairness.
---
**How We Run Things**
---
 - Fairness and transparency: Consistently show up and you will get gear. Our loot system is designed to make sure everyone who consistently shows up to raid gets geared out.
---
 - Progression Oriented: We're going to clear content, and have fun doing it. As we put dungeons on farm, we'll be placing raids like MC on (non mandatory) off nights to focus on clearing new content. We expect people who show up to raid to give it thier all.
---
 - Just Hardcore Enough: Real life always takes precedent over the game. Our main focus is progression, but we're understanding and empathetic towards folks who need to step away or miss guild events. 
---
**Recruiting** 
---
 - Everyone

Hell yeah.  No more hiding behind anonymous internet names. Fight me IRL ^(in game) when you talk crap now!
---
Better cities? Yes. Better lore+zones? Completely objective. I lvld a tauren warrior to 60 and rerolled a n811 warrior to 60. I like the horde side more for questing. And i'm not really planing on spending too much time in cities tbh
---
All specs not being raid viable the same way they are in TBC/WOTLK.
---
Amen!
---
I bought the 99 cent trial disc at an EB games with my first ever allowance and my dad said “what could go wrong?” He ended up playing super hardcore up until Wrath and I played casual along side him on the same account. I would sub in for him on raid nights while he went out for smoke or bathroom breaks and I’d sit close by and read the chat for him because our guild didn’t use team speak. They could tell when I was playing and it spawned a guild meme “Explain it so the kid understands” 
---
I remember him letting me stay home from school once because he let me stay up until 2am with him to watch his guild down Illidan for the first time. Mom was pissed, dad and I woke up the whole house screaming! Can’t wait to relive these moments again
---
What about abandoning your family tips? i need advice how to get rid of my kids, wife and my job? You sound like you know what you are talking about since china numwba one and you beat them.
---
I had a great 10 minutes watching the log in screen, life is great, I’ll pass on your help thanks
---
Ive done this m8, got disappointed/excited both ways :D
---
Nope, horde has refused to do AV for years. 
---
Meta changes requires actual changes. But even retail can’t fix AV.
---
More like aluminum bats.
---
Duel starts faster when you let the rogue open.
---
When i duelled as a rogue and enemy just spammed aoe spells trying to find me, i just sat back, chilled until he got frustrated and i could open in that window.
---
Against some really hard lucky spammers who gets rogue out before....rogue can just vanish and wait for vanish CD in the corner. Also /forfeit and reduel the moment he gets you out works great aswell
---
Wait, daze isn't a thing anymore in retail?
---
I'm rolling the same 2 classes with different races. Originally played gnome mage as a main (all content as frost spec) with an orc fury warrior I only played for a short time in MC/ZG. This time I'm playing a prot spec Tauren warrior with a mage alt (undecided race, probably undead) that I want to wait until later and play fire with.
---
Right so you would agree that body position has more of an affect than body mass?
---
yep resilience imo did a lot of damage to WoW.  personally i think hardcore raiders SHOULD be powerful in PvE - else why fuckin bother getting geared?  to look good in IF/org??
---
and then giving everybody damage multiplying talents and crit bonuses and so on.... then completely neutralising all of that by giving EVERYBODY a common stat which basically normalises it all??  YAWN.  I remember i got back into WoW later into tbc (i quit just before it started) and I had a rogue in like the first tier of pve epics, and the damage i was doing to my friend's priest in arena gear was laughable.  it was like being lvl 50 in vanilla and trying to kill a 60 prot warrior
---
says the guy who thinks mage is hard...
---
I played a lot high level pvp as a mage and recently I played on some dueling servers, mage is just not hard at all.

Google is also a performance enhancing drug then. Classic WoW should only work if no active browser is detected on the computer. And your phone must be in airplane mode.

I linked a rogue class guide that answers the questions the op asked concisely and completely. It is perhaps the only constructive piece within this thread. It’s that thing in blue text. Hard to miss unless you are in a rush to post a nonsensical, hypocritical retort to salve your ego.
---
If someone is asking for class advice and has specific pointed questions what they are looking for is practical information from people that can answer from a pool of information the poster does not have. 
---
What they don’t need is an opinion from someone that is merely regurgitating something they read from else  on a board...that may have read that piece from another person on a board and so on and so on. This is how rumors become fact and a poor way to vet and spread meaningful information.

Do you see why not posting is often the best choice now?

Well Its balancing out on 330 more upvotes than downvotes so I guess you’re right
---
Would you care to explain how you came to that conclusion?
---
You're fundamentally misunderstanding my point, I'm saying that there is all the reason in the world for horde AV meta to move beyond dealing with a de facto loss and having to deal with the HKs you manage to acquire.

Im pretty sure you replied to the wrong comment my dude.

---
I did this by playing a couple chars to 20 too to get a feel. I'm focused on end game and I know once leveling is over that's it, but I wanted to pick something not just for what life at 60 was like, but also something I would feel good about having invested that leveling time into. Looking at my character frame and seeing '60' is always going to bring back memories of the journey there for as long as I play at end game
---
it goes the other way too,, ive seen way more classic players shitting on retail that the other way around, i don't care which you like more, i am gonna play the one (classic) i like more than the other (retail) and if someone enjoys retail more then why should i care about that, let them
---
&gt; People will be buying just to stock up when it's cheap.
---
That's me! As a paladin, i have essentially 100 'free' gold at 40 to use to pick up cheap mats week 1 of launch.
---
Same here. I’m a rogue though so I’ll do the /soothe and question emotes to try and let them know im friendly. Sometimes I have farming to do and limited time to do it. Id rather do it on peace and if the horde is in the same boat theres no reason we can’t both get our chores done.
---
Been playing WoW since vanilla and learned something in my first days from a experienced player that I lived by ever since:
---
Tank dies, healers fault.
---
Healer dies, tanks fault
---
DPS dies, it's their own fault.
---
As for idiots who tell you to pull faster never understood or will understand due to the impression they give for their lack of patience is threat in vanilla is far more different than retail. A single spell crit from a caster DPS can rip off a tank. So people need to pay attention. I know it's horrible.
---
Also like other people have said. Marking targets is a good idea as visual analogy works best instead of chat.
---
I was also firm on the choice of Warlock, having played one in vanilla many years ago... Until I remembered how soul shards worked. I remember being SO happy when they finally released craftable soul shards bags, but even then I felt like having to farm shards all the time was a poor system.
---
I've since decided on Priest.
---
Okay yeh the bridge is great choke and multiple archers can shoot there. 
---
Do you think the assumption that "horde always loses" leads to less players trying to win and it could be that horde is actually 30 players actively trying?
---
I am asking because I haven't played private servers and genuenly want to know and understand and analyze I guess. And I somehow think it can't be the only reason (unless win ratio is just something like 40-60 in favor of alliance)
---
Gimmie that Jah Ith Ber baby

---
It's a matter of preference. I very much prefer the old theme, the old forums (strictly because the new forums are absolute dog shit), and you need realm community sections on there which I cannot see.
---
Treating this as a sub section on retail whether it be on the launcher, or the website or the forums is not appealing.
---
Maybe you are more suited to the instant rewards and bland classes of live then. I will play both, but don't pretend like you the pvpers im classic would be to easy for you.
---
You'll want to set it to a generic modifier as opposed to gshift. It will eventually shit out on you. Just set the binding the Ctrl or Alt. However you modify for secondary bars. I've gone through 3 or 4 g600s and this has happened on every single one.
---
Blizz already said they’d consider bc and wrath.
---
I think with the coming of Classic a lot of people will realize that you never needed 8 tanks. I personally know a guy who did it with 4 and one of them was a druid.
---
There wasn't nearly enough time for a Naxx meta to develop in vanilla. Not to mention players were generally much worse than now and people ran around in terrible homebrew specs.

Yep, there are a lot of "it depends" for these meme specs.  But there's the whole issue on bringing a meme spec that comes with it.  You won't get priority on items, you'll likely get thrown into the "roll for PvP" so you're getting secondhand rolls.
---
If you're in a loot council, they'll already make it clear your loot standing (unless you're the guild leader and feeding gear to yourself, which will just cause more drama).  If you're in DKP, you just hope there is officer discretion on priority order so you're not rolling on DFT as a ret paladin over all other classes.
---
Of course, because I only speak for myself and not for everyone else.

**&lt;Moderna Misstag&gt; [EU-PVP] Swedish Semi-Hardcore Raiding**
---
We are a group of friends that have been playing WoW since Vanilla Beta and day 1 on the EU launch back in 2005 and now we turn all of our attention towards WoW Classic and we want you to join us!
---
We want to establish a Swedish speaking guild that will be highly respected on our server and have a great community who realise that real life responsibilities comes first and gaming comes second but who still want to have a great time playing WoW Classic. We offer a mature and relaxed raiding environment where everyone feels welcome.
---
First and foremost we want to enjoy our time spent playing the game and if we ensure that we and all of our raiders have a great time playing together then raid progression will follow. Besides having fun the goal will always be to clear all raid content at a steady and reliable pace.
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wed/Sun: 19:30-22:30 CET
---
We plan on raiding twice a week for the initial phases and then likely add a third raid day as we progress into the later phases and additional raids are added.
---
**Loot System**
---
A DKP system will be used, exactly what version of decay/closed/open bid etc is not determined yet. Certain items will be separate from the DKP system, such as gearing up tanks but everything will be done with transparency and fairness in mind.
---
**Expectations**
---
Attitude, Attendance, Performance
---
To us player attitude and behaviour is the most important aspect of being a good guild member, both in dealing with other guild members but also with the rest of the servers community. Poor behaviour on your part will not only tarnish your own reputation but also the guilds reputation and we will not tolerate that. That being said as long as you treat people with a nice and respectable attitude we will not have a problem.
---
Besides having a good attitude we want you to have as good of a raid attendance as you can manage, but it is our job as a community to provide you with an enjoyable experience so that you want to log in and attend raids and perform to the best of your ability. It does not matter if you have previous raiding experience or if you are completely new to the game as long as you are a team player with the mindset that the guild itself will always be more important than any individual member.

Blizzard didn't actually say the event has the original event. Blizzard said it'll be an old-school inspired version of AV, not "a classic version of Alterac Valley that is identical to how it was when it initially released".
---
good nice to know.
---
Two weeks, three weeks, four weeks... Whatever. I'm just assuming super-tryhards at launch. But the time is completely irrelevant to the point.
---
Just pick one and go. It's really not a big of deal as everyone said. It's more about what you want to do.
---
Paladins are not viable raid tanks.  He'll have to be rolling his own setup forcing people to cater to his sub optimal spec.
---
It does matter. It's the reason why when someone asks me what music I listen to I can't just say I like Techno because they think I mean Darude - Sandstorm and Deadmau5
---
You don\`t have any abilities, and you need to the get to the end and also play it a bit to ""know"" if its right for you.  :)
---
This was how most games went around the AQ40/naxx phase during actual vanilla as well.  People would be PISSED if you stopped and attacked in the middle causing a multi-hour battle instead of rushing.  It was beneficial for both sides to have quick games even if alliance won most of them.
---
Respect costs.
---
no we rly don't.
---
how bold of you to presume i dont already now how to do max dps
---
If you've never healed in a raid, I can see how you would come to your conclusion. If you can't see the benefit to downranking heals, nothing I can say would probably change your mind. It's like you arguing that the color blue isn't blue, I'll just sit there and smile and nod.
---
Shit dude, did you read what I wrote? 
---
&gt;&gt; The &lt;&lt;hardcore&gt;&gt; people keep telling everybody druid's are just a meme. Can't heal dungeons, can't tank better than warriors, can't dps.
---
Read the comment thread, I replied to a somebody that was backing up druid healers. I'm all for druids, I've mained one since Vanilla, pre Innervate moving out of your talent trees. I tanked in MC/BWL all the way to ICC in WotLK. I. Love. Druids.
---
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I'm glad more people are getting turned off druids. I can't wait to be the only one in the raid getting at the phat loot.
---
Again, I love druids. I was just saying that it means more loot for people if people believe the bullshit that druids are somebody a meme.
---
Amen.
---
This is a completely different game from retail. They're going to have to learn to play differently if they want to succeed in classic.
---
I for one am not a fan of this sense of entitlement in dungeon runs. It's vanilla. Dungeons take more time and are paced slower. This isn't because the tank it slow, it's because the game mechanics are slow.
---
Slow hp/mana regen, even when eating/drinking. Long cooldowns. Warriors are the best tanks, but also have a ramp up time, so you can't just go HAM on the pull like in retail.
---
Let them die until they learn, or earn a reputation bad enough that nobody will invite them.
---
If the numbers are good enough they will share them :)
---
If not you will get the usual "performing as projected" vagueness.
---
There is an achievment for winning in 6 minutes.
---
We don't deserve anything except what it subscription gets us, by contract.

Wanting something isn't the same as being entitled to it.

Never thought of it that way but that's so true lmao.
---
fuck u
---
Same class, but NE to now Orc War.
---
Do you not need to be exalted to ride any of the pvp mounts of other classes?
---
My ex and I leveled together as a prot paladin and destro Fire lock, focusing a lot on aoe.  It was very fun and unorthodox.  I think you’re absolutely right, it worked well together but felt very subpar apart.
---
There's always someone
---
No you don't both with.
---
If the intended way is that I don't pay at all, because I need it and you don't. Then I'm inherently losing out when I'm forced to pay because someone else decided to ignore the system, ninja the item and then charge for it back. Discount or not.
---
Why someone should sell a BoE is when they get it because there wasn't a class or person who needed it there. Not because someone who needed it was there and you took it from them.
---
Do you realise how logically inconsistent you are? You're saying everyone needs gold so it has the same value to everyone. Then you're saying that doesn't apply to BoP? Well using your logic it absolutely must.
---
Saying ninjaing exists therefore everyone should ninja as some weird way of saying you can't be a ninja if everyone is, is a really really bizarre take.
---
Time investment. It takes month to get to 60. And if you are there and hate what your class IS in the end, you just wasted time bro. And time at a certain age is a precious thing :)
---
The chances of them building a separate classic website are essentially 0. It’s not a sub-section, it’s literally its own section. Just like on the launcher where under the World of Warcraft tan, you pick which version you want to play.
---
What an entitled bitch
---
Throwing a shield spike on will get a lot of value out of redoubt and make your leveling faster.
---
I will say dungeon tanking without conc is miserable. You can solo level at prot fine, but when it comes to dungeons not having conc makes keeping aggro on groups difficult.
---
I see what you did here.
---
The av on private servers are not the same as the one that commenter is referencing
---
Historically WoW grew throughout Vanilla and peaked at around 8 million just before BC released. It continued to grow and crossed 10 million mid-BC, then reached 12 million by the end of BC and sustained at that level all through Wrath until just after Cata launch, when the great decline began. It peaked at 10 million again around the launches of Mists and Warlords, but quickly declined after those peaks. So far as we can tell from what comments Blizzard has made about concurrency peaking at the launch of BFA, it probably again hit around 10 million, but likely has fallen off even faster to lower lows than the previous two expansions.
---
The lesson here being, the only points in WoW's recent history where the population of active subs has been around 10 million were major expansion launches (i.e., large releases of brand new content). Classic is unprecedented in that it is a re-release of old content, but you're on pretty shaky ground extrapolating either from Vanilla numbers (which never hit 10 million at any point) or recent expansion launches (which peaked at 10 million only briefly), to arguing that a re-release of a decade old game will peak, let alone sustain, at a similar level.
---
That's not to say it can't. Certainly somewhere out there in the world are around 10 million people (and maybe a few million more who have come and gone over the years) who were at one time fans of the game and might be again. But keep in mind, lots and lots of those people only started in later expansions and don't have any particular love for Vanilla or even care about it one way or the other. And even though lots of people played Classic quite a bit, that doesn't mean that all of them prefer the Vanilla game to any later phase that they liked and played even more.
---
Reality is, most people when you get down to it tend to like the version of the game that they started with most, because that's the time when they had the most fun and everything was new and shiny and happy, they weren't jaded about it all, and all of their friends still played. For lots of people that version was the Vanilla game, but for plenty of others some other, later version is the one that feels like home.
---
Certainly the launch will be big. WoW has been the biggest MMO in at least the western market for going on a decade and a half. All of the other MMOs that have tried legacy or progression servers have seen good success with the concept. Relatively, Classic WoW is likely to be an even bigger success just because the game as a whole is bigger and it has a massively larger built-in fanbase to tap that may be interested in it.
---
Realistically, the game market being what it is, it's just very unlikely that any re-release of old content is likely to come anywhere near the performance of past releases of major new content expansions, or even the Vanilla game itself when it was brand new. People like new stuff, even if it's new stuff that is like old stuff. There is a market for re-releases of old stuff, but it's nowhere near as big as the market for the truly new (even if it's old-school new). Look at remasters of any old game, no matter how beloved if you doubt this. Yes, they may do well, but they don't do anywhere near as well as an initial release. They keep coming out because compared to the cost of up-front development remastering a game costs a pittance and is profitable even with miniscule sales compared to the original. But these are not projects that a company is going to dump $100 million into expecting a proportional new-game-launch scale return.
---
My guess, based on WoW's historical population trends, is that somewhere between 1 million and 5 million will at least try it in the first month. Somewhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million may play it through the full course of the phased content releases, up through the release of Naxx. Within a couple of months after Naxx releases, the population will fall off slowly to a core of people who are happy to play it more or less forever, even if nothing new ever is added. This may be as many as several hundred thousand active players --- say 250-500k realistically. Then the game will trend back toward the cyclical boom and decline that we've seen with modern WoW whenever new things are added (whatever those eventually may be).
---
Of course, at any level Classic is a net plus to Blizzard's bottom line, even if it only manages to keep a few 10s of thousands of subscribers around long term. Any stable population at all certainly would be enough to offset the very limited cost of deployment and ongoing support, without new content development. But if it maintains at a higher level, like half a million or more of people who Blizzard knows otherwise would not be maintaining their subs, then of course they will put in more resources to keep that money coming through the door.
---
I wouldn't go that far.  But it is a bit disappointing how much of a difference it can make with a clean UI with no mods vs someone running all the best.  
---
Things like threat meters, DPS meters (brings in a whole e-peen flex), decurse, raid windows (although this was later added), enemy cast bars/timers.
---
But some things, I think it was Hearthstone devs that made this point, is that if something can be done with a pen and paper, automating that with a UI mod is perfectly acceptable.  So stuff like auctioneer is good, you could argue that cast timers are the same but realistically you're not holding a stopwatch to hit timers everytime a spell is cast.
---
All in all, would have been nice if the game was without UI mods, but at the same time it is what it is.  Can't change that.
---
I've lost my virginity here. I mean before I went to STV I was this young and naive priestess who'd picked a class to help people, not to kill them. Sure, I was levellingin as sp but that was against monsters and to protect myself. And I thought all gankers were terrible people and probably 12 years old and I'd never act like them.
---
But then I came to STV and after dying like twenty times in first ten minutes I was getting back to my quest after yet another graveyard run and there was this alliance player and all I could think was "I can win if I attack first". Only after staring at his body I realised it was just some poor helpless holy priest and now I was this terrible 12 years old ganker.
---
But there was no coming back from that so I discovered all these cool ways to kill peolple especially with mind control and later levelled up a rogue just to have some fun.
---
At first I thought it was going to be bad but it proved me wrong.
---
to be fair i probably haven't looked for this track on youtube since before that was uploaded :P 
---
thanks very much for the links i'll check em out :D
---
Doesn't really that much more effort. The bare minimum is communicating to your groups that you need a moment to get threat before they start blasting DPS, otherwise you are fine.
---
I'm aware of that. Yet, I still expect people to try playing a prot pala MT, if they can find 39 people ok with that. And if a guild has a prot pala MT or even as 2nd position, then I'd like to stay in contact with that person, because I'll be very interested as to how that works out.
---
A prot pala in the MT position is the biggest handicap you can give yourself in terms of raiding.
---
Literally everything on that website is BFA related except that small section on the forums...so yes that makes it a tiny small sub section.
---
Only 3 classes can beat it in full Naxx. That feels okay in my mind.
---
As long as your energy doesn’t cap you are fine
---
those were all mostly during vanilla.
---
release AV is practically a different battleground.  1.12 -&gt; 8.2 is basically they added resources so games can't last forever.
---
oh yeah i remember making a a gnome with a hitler mustache, good times
---
Oh noes can't critique daddy blizz? :(
---
You're not wrong lol
---
When they hit the shield, you aren't getting hit. So you do not generate rage.
---
I was a rank 11 who helped multiple people get rank 13/14 on vanilla. We most certainly rushed AV to maximize honor. We would all join queue at the same time as 12-15 people and tell the random which GY to grab and we would setup for a 15 minute boss fight. It was pretty critical anytime we didn’t have a full/solid WSG or AB team
---
Yes, I kinda forgot that I suppose.
---
Didn’t read a word of this because I knew it was going to be some nonsense
---
OT is viable. Anything that involves aoe pulls you make life a bit easier.

---
I did read what you wrote. I'm telling you, these hardcore people you're ripping on aren't saying this. I'm one of those people and my guild will definitely have a Feral OT, some RDruids, and possibly a Kitty. They're solid specs that bring utility and help alleviate gear congestion. You won't see a Boomkin in my raid though because that's a legitimate meme spec.
---
I guess I get tired of people assuming so much. "Hardcore" players aren't dicks and short of true meme specs every class will be present in 40 man raids.
---
Really? Nowhere on the website is there any mention of Classic or any info pertaining to the game?
---
This is the reason I'm rolling druid. Mained pally in classic, rogue in late bc/wotlk. I wanna heal, but I cant give up stealth. Imo, druid is the perfect mix of the classes I mained back in the day. My friends want me to roll priest if i want to heal. No stealth? Fugouta here
---
My link is not a argument it is a fact. 
---
You can argue about special circumstances. You can ofcause say the gaming market wasn't that big or quick expanding back in the days. I could argue Vanilla was the shit back then and this time around most gamers do not even know about classic. But let´s agree it won't be 10 Million :)
---
I suppose I just don't understand the fascination of playing as suboptimal as possible for no reason.  Classic wow for the most part is a solved problem. We know what works, and what is awful. There is no primary aspect of the game where prot pally is a good choice.
---
Hey man, I think my guild Doggo Noir would be a great fit for you and your friend. We will be raiding from 7-10pm EST on Tuesday/Thursday. We are a semi-hardcore Alliance raiding guild rolling on a PvP server. Come jump on our discord and see if you think it'll be a good place for you and your friend.

True, but realm forums would be a worthwhile addition for sure. Class? Maybe also.
---
Poorly designed talents.
---
ok Sherlock 98% of it is BFA - except 1% small sub section on the forums, and 1% small add saying classing will be back... jesus christ
---
Hunters get so much hate because most hunters suck, and most hunters suck because they don't need to learn how to play at all to get by. They have little incentive to partner out in the world since other classes mostly slow them down. They have little incentive to run instances since there is so little loot for them in instances until 60. Meanwhile priests and warriors have been grinding in groups since lvl 15 and have learned to work as a team.
---
The class itself is awesome, hunter rewards good play possibly the most of any other class. But the class also doesn't force the player into coordinated play the way every other class does which ultimately stunts the growth of most hunter players.
---
I'm rolling bear and rolling proud.
---
More forum sections I’m fine with, but a separate website is nuts.
---
Actually best to get a swing timer and time your sinister strikes with it.
---
I disagree. At level 10 you already have a good idea of what a class can do, and you can look at the talent tree to see if there's any fantasy that suits the way you wanna play.
---
I remember playing a shaman back in the day, and after doing the earth elemental quest I instantly knew this was the class for me.
---
Definitely makes non-warrior/feral tanks a bit better. Makes Pally/Shaman tanks a little better cause they don't rely on meleeing as much as the others, makes Warlock tanks 10% better than previous calculations (which were already scarily good) because they don't melee at all.
---
"Fuck you I won't do what ya tell me!" Blizzard... probably
---
Yeah, telling jerks not to be jerks has always been extremely effective.
---
r/whoosh
---
Pro rogues (Small min Max here) use their abilities right after a mainhand auto attack. There are multiple effects that proc a weapon swing and these effects reset your swing timer. So to get the most out of the proc, it’s best to try to proc it right after your swing
---
I already have my playlist for classic. Live to win is the only song, and yes it'll be on repeat till I hit 60.
---
I'm not so sure if 4-5 healers could tend to a 40man raid. Especially since at least one of them would have to focus on the tank.
---
Damnit!
---
Most likely not... unless you know a cosplayer that has crafted that specific helmet.
---
Thanks I'll check it out, it's just me though. Sorry if wording was confusing. Not decided what I'm gonna play and had it narrowed down to those 3 :)
---
That's actually a good point! They did say they might enable free transfers if necessary, but imagine being the unpopulated faction. This could be a difficult task.

Right back at you.
---
God forbid anyone plays around with off meta specs. They are making a community to discuss that stuff and you want to shit on it.  
---
Please show me on the dolly where the meme spec hurt you.
---
The fascination is making something work despite it being bad. Everybody can join a raid with optimal composition and just blast through the content. There will be many thousands of people doing that and it's been done many times before. But how many can say, they've beaten Kel'Thuzad with a prot pala MT?
---
The challenge is what's interesting to some people, you might as well ask why some people play games on hard difficulty, when they'd have an easier time playing on easy.
---
&gt; [Here's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_mOG0iQtUY) 
---
Beckon da best. That 1.10 video introduced me to Hospital Records. Goddamn.
---
Basically every class have some sort of self heal aswell.
---
Rogue, Warr, Hunter even.
---
I understand the balance idea of it for PvP but my god is it lame for actual gameplay.
---
So a couple of things. 
---
Addons aren't like steroids they're like legal superior gear which is a thing in all sports if you don't want the best golf club thats up to you but the option is available and in WoW it isn't even p2w.
---
2nd:  
---
&gt;Imagine if an Addon re-creates the "Dungeon Finder" in Classic, or a "Looking For Raid" functionality?
---
These are social addons that are only as useful as the amount of people using them.  Similar addons existed in vanilla if you don't like it don't use it.
---
I actually like daze in classic and dislike it in retail. In classic it makes you have to consider going through mobs or going around them, lets stealth characters have an edge getting deep into the heart of the enemies camp and adds more danger to the world. In retail it's just an annoyance "Sigh I got dazed, kill the 5 mobs on me in 20 seconds and mount back up".
---
Of course! I was only able to learn all this by others on Reddit who have shared their knowledge. GLHF.
---
If I recall correctly both the paladin and warlock mount quests still required a fair bit of gold to complete, I know the pally one did for sure. All the way leveling I didn't really worry about saving because of the free mount, then there were a load of materials I needed to complete each part of the quest. Some were expensive too.
---
I made a mistake when I changed the title - I didn't update AutoMod appropriately. There is a new one being posted.
---
Hi, /u/Zhelus

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.

---
Interesting, considering I see a WoW classic tab on the left drop down menu where 100% of the info is classic related. 
---
You’re just one of the bitter anti-retail people who can’t even bear for classic info to be on the same website, so you’re complaining about the most unimportant things and throwing around numbers like “only 2% is classic related.”
---
why is it nuts? it's literally what 3 hours of works tops?
---
they can have a button on the website to direct from Classic to retail...and vice versa from retail to Classic.
---
Worldofwarcraft.com/Classic

Worldofwarcraft.com/BFA
---
Like why are you making it seem it's a huge endeavor lmfao.
---
I think you don't understand what you said...  or maybe you were trying to be sarcastic?
---
When is this happening? Isn’t the classic anniversary in nov?
---
Okay
---
Flight paths. They were so much longer then once they optimized them.
---
All I know is my 55 year old Brother-in-law called me hyped about classic.  That dude has called me like 3 times in 20 years.
---
Need a win for the quest!
---
There are no freedom of speech issues associated with barrens chat.  Ignore the fact that blizzard is a private entity and can set whatever rules they want or not in their space. There are penalties to pay for the things you say. Even if your free to say them.
---
I was actually kicked from my guild on a PServer for saying Druids are great dungeon tanks while leveling. The GLeader was a warrior and threw a very strange fit.
---
Pre-hotting, going bear and running in is tons of AOE threat, very easy on your healer (In really low levels they can DPS most the time and heal you every now and then), and it’s hardly gear dependent. At least on PServers I much preferred good bears over even geared warriors (Again, while leveling)
---
At 60 I think it’s good for a raid to have 1 Bear, but by no means do I think they’re capable of every fight
---
It’s a pointless endeavor. It adds no value. It makes no sense for the business or for the customer.
---
I think I'm at the peak moment of my life for wow classic. No more student so no more homeworks nor long day in school, a 9-5 job so I'm home early, no kids and a wife excited to play Classic with me.
---
TBC got it just right. except it needs the wotlk Sated debuff and for hero to be raid wide.
---
Not good enough. Most of the horde skips anything dealing with AV and moves on to other things.
---
The quest still required a lot of expensive materials to complete, same with pally. It basically almost evened out.
---
You mean that tab that redirects to the page explaining Classic will be back? oh noes here add another 0.1% for having that button.
---
Mages got bloodlust too, tree of life was turned into a healing CD also
---
The struggle :(
---
Nah, I’d rather roll what I always regretted not rolling, than roll the same thing all over again. A chance for a fresh start and all
---
Loving the encouragement! (Not scarasm) :)
---
I'd be set if my wife weren't playing classic for the first time. She is going with my original race/class combo so I am going to be doing something different this time. Sure would like to be able to make a decision but I'm back and forth all the time.
---
LMAO stranglethorniastan I love that
---
Apologies. When I typed hardcore I think I meant min/maxxers. The ones who treat WoW like a spreadsheet and race choices mean invite or ignore for their raid group.
---
Good luck in the raids.
---
No. Im more certain than anything that you are not understanding me at all. But that’s not a problem. Just accept it
---
What do you aim for when picking a class to level? Difficulty, enjoyment, accessibility... I personally will play Druid becouse I love shapeshifting and becouse it is easy to level
---
Repair costs.
---
Prot spec with Reckoning. Aoe, never, die, never run oom thanks to the blessing, wtf are ya\`ll talking about ...slow??
---
They were called wrath babies for a reason. Wrath was the death of a game that catered to vanilla raiders. 
---
Blizzard wanted a wider audience and they got it.
---
I mean, SPriest isn’t a meme. You just only want 1 per raid group. 
---
But you don’t get to wear your tier, pretty much all of your gear will be given to mages / locks first, and your rotation is extremely dull. But they’re definitely not memes
---
What a blast from the past! I remember this video from back then!
---
Main developer has said they wanted to limit hybrids to about 90% of the dmg of pure dps, which ended up being mostly all healers because it was non-optimal to bring a lower dps when that healer would have the same utility. That plus they just went with it and made tier gear only for their healing specs, which in my opinion is the worst part of it all.
---
Holy fuck, what a nostalgic blast from the past.
---
i'll be listening to Hybrid Theory and Meteora. Good ol' times
---
I've never understood this sentiment. PvP and PvE are both elements of the same game. It makes complete sense for anyone who ignores one to be lacking in the other.
---
If you wanted a straight pvp game, you never should have logged in to an MMO in the first place.
---
This is pretty true and sucks. Not much point rushing to 60 unless you’re going for records because then you’ll get to the next bottleneck until the next phase releases. All people are going to be doing is pointless pvp and then MC and Ony
---
I was gonna say the same thing! Loved lemmings
---
Man, I've only heard good things from people who used Firestone back in vanilla, and the footage makes it look strong too. Did you use Firestone in vanilla and dislike it? I'm looking for one man to say it was bad who used it for more than 120 seconds.
---
In terms of sports...it is illegal.
---
I have never bought an addon, i have just downloaded them which is not illegal in comparison. This is the dumbest thing ever.
---
Not complaining, my reply was actually meant for /u/awesometographer a bit down who said there has been no launch issues in years.
---
Ok now I know you are joking.
---
What the fuck do you want it to have? It has the global release schedule, videos, explanation on how to access, a media gallery, a game manual download. 
---
The game isn’t even released yet. What do you expect some massive banner saying “classic is better than retail.  BFA sucks real heroes of Azeroth come back to Classic, the real World of Warcraft.”
---
Give me a break.
---
And once you hit 60, you can farm some karma at neckbeardnests.
---
People can enjoy things which are badly designed. Just because someone likes something doesn't mean it's good.
---
I'm quite certain at this point. Its going to be Horde. Warrior. Probably Orc because I like the lore etc.
---
The real question for me is: Mage, Shaman or Druid as 2nd character? I'll probably level the Mage second and a Shaman third when I have some friends who want to spam dungeons together.
---
I mean more viable as a standard dps like lock/war/rogue/hunter/etc
---
You take one spriest at most and I wish we could take more lol
---
"The materials to complete the quest line cost far more than the 1000g to straight-up buy an “epic” (swift) ground mount. A Pristine Black Diamond alone cost more than 1000g on the Auction House during classic."
---
Source Google, also was paladin.
---
Nobody cares about online discussion about how x y z game is more popular than a b c game.
---
People are so concerned today if they are doing the "popular" thing. Just fucking play what you want to instead of following popular trends.
---
"We the players deserve to know if our game is popular and if our cause was right all along."
---
How are you going to "define" popular?
---
Your comment made me laugh. Thx alot
---
Dota is boring compared to lol? Wtf rofl I think he meant the other way around
---
Yeah IMO in terms of class balance TBC really hit the sweet spot, basically every class/spec was playable and still mostly felt true to their original vanilla identity, they were just fleshed out a bit more so you didn't have completely dead specs anymore
---
Yeah I think TBC's class balance was incredible. There were a couple instances of things like Sunwell warlocks replacing all mages, but for pretty much the entire game every class/spec was viable and each brought something unique.
---
More combo points?
---
Yeah TBC class design was on point. Suck that flying mounts and the 10 extra levels expansion setup were just terrible for longterm. Vanilla with some of the TBC changes (but not the full talents, because powercreep) would be really interesting. I wouldn't trust Blizzard to do it properly though, #nochanges.

---
There was roughly a month period on Horde known as "Scorched Earth." Horde were pissed off because of the changes/nerfs and how they blatantly supported Alliance. The win ratio for Alliance was ridiculous.  So what we often did was 70% of the team would just turtle and slow the entire game to a crawl in hopes that the Alliance would give up. This also was before reinforcements were introduced, and I would take a bet that one of the reasons why reinforcements were put into AV later in TBC was because the amount of turtling Horde were doing.
---
the respec cost is encouraging icy veins and such, why bother doing something original when it's so expensive to change to the best?
---
Yes TBC got it just right, for me as a warlock back than, we shat on everyone from the beginning till the end, only glaive rogues could get close on some fights.
---
He’s a retail player get him!!!
---
/s
---
Tank specs are naturaly immune to daze too
---
"Smite Priests" are not really that "off-meta", at least for leveling. Properly specced, they are not that much less efficient that Shadow Priests for leveling, with the additional benefit of being better dungeon healers.  So if you plan on doing a lot of dungeons while leveling to 60, it's a pretty reasonable choice.
---
Lol I don't need a high sub count to validate my choice to play the game, maybe you should play for yourself
---
I agree thou sometimes calling someone out and harassing them when you in a dungeon etc due to them screwing up over and over again is a good thing since they are not learning from mistakes it may make them quit or focus up
---
It's the same as the die-hard Vanilla players whenever TBC is mentioned.
---
Arguably they never should have been, as everyone using them aren't playing the way it's "meant" to be played.
---
I remember watching this one in my early days of playing the game. For me though, my first WoW vid was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM2rFZGujhk

My core group never fell apart and I'm eternally grateful for that.  I met my 2 best friends in WoW back in Cata/MoP, and we've talked nearly every day since then.  All 3 of us are extremely excited for Classic and can't wait to get into the grind together.

Some people are definitely just excusing their lack of trying with the "map favors alliance" mentality even when you can actually win a game.
---
A strong 5-man squad with geared warriors can carry the horde to Vanndar.
---
However, on pservers you'll usually see a couple of alli hunters and mages that are masters of turtling - they can hold off an average 40man horde raid with maybe 4-5 people. So it always depends on the situation whether you can win or not.

To be fair, Riot Lyte is exactly the type of person who is a problem to a community. Dude is completely unreasonable and driven by a vendetta against bullies from when he was in school. It's sad that he doesn't realize he's the toxic one now.
---
IT'S HAPPENING
---
I’ve never rolled a rouge. Played through a few expacs. BC, little bit of wrath, then came back for WoD till now.
---
I started one in bfa but never got anywhere. 
---
I’ve mained pretty much every other class at some point. So I’m going with rouge.
---
And boy do I plan on being one of the most cancerous rouges I can be &gt;:)
---
I don't care about the wording, I just didn't want to risk being auto banned. Some subreddits ban some don't, cba to remember which is which, but good on you for jumping to conclusions...
---
hahaha good one
---
Haha yeah. The word toxic gets on my nerves these days.
---
Man, 3 Doors Down had some good songs.
---
I get that.  But they are wanting people to play during the first 2 hours to see what numbers will be like,  how the system handles it.
---
I will pay you
---
Anytime a classic pvp video is brought up theres always the people who feel the need to judge the player by today's standards.
---
 Reproduction!
---
No, but item exist now to become immune to daze during limited time. And tank specs are naturaly immune to daze. You want to travel as a war, hit "prot spec" and go, you are immune. 
---
Same for DK/DH/Monk/Pala/Druid

No u

It doesn't really matter what class you pick.

All classes are fun, all classes are viable.

As long as it's not Druid or Paladin, they suck.

No Blood Elves 😊

How do loot drops from world bosses work? Assuming everyone hitting the boss is not grouped in some way.
---
bear in mind this was a short time after TI1 when nobody really knew much.  he was basically just comparing lane phase of the games
---
If you install a rogue energy addon you dont have to spam abilities that much, you learn quickly when the right time is to use them.
---
It is noticable on everything. I am a guy who used to play everythign with like 20-30 fps due to shitty computer and considered it fluent. Then one I was able to play WoW at 60fps and was pumped how different and fluent and... smooth it was!...  
---
Then I was 144hz.... I have realised that .. there is a difference!... a huge one... it felt... alive a bit
---
\*points to dps and healing meters\* Right there officer.

Op asked abt 40 which is freee
---
I was bullied for wanting to talk about World of Warcraft to much in grade school.
---
spriest can be alright but I can tell you're garbo :(
---
Not wanting people who harass and flame others ingame is toxic now?
---
We're happy for ya
---
wait wot
---
So you are saying that something the original game developers has crafted and supported as a part of the game, is not the way it is meant to be played?
---
So what is your budget for this ? Would be good to know to give you recommendations.
---
Added quotation marks for your extremely high IQ.
---
Not true. Itemization is based on 1.12. It's been confirmed:  
---
"This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions."
---
That i thinkminwant it, but i dont
---
Just play mage you will be valued and have fun
---
So then he's a ninja. Then what? You spend hours in orgrimmar yelling 'XX IS A NINJA'? Then he lays low, levels to 60, then everyone forgets. Kinda like all the celebrities caught in any scandal nowadays. 
---
I'm not saying I disagree with you that it sucks, but if you really need a BoE, you should be willing to pay for it.

Nah I'm not stupid enough to go NElf Rogue again.
---
The first "kill x wolves" quest is going to be brutal.
---
If they're making money then they are not unemployed.
---
It's because people have different ideas on what makes class balance. Some people believe that not every class/spec should be good at every aspect of the game and that brings balance. For example ele shamans suck and raid dps but are insane in PvP. It's not all about things being even, it's about having different strengths and weaknesses and a unique set of tools to go with it.
---
When you have every side of every internet argument calling the other the same thing, the word is completely redundant. The classic community is toxic. The retail community is toxic. /r/classicwow is toxic. The official forums are definitely toxic. Twitch is toxic. You're toxic. I'm toxic. Is everyone toxic, or is it in fact nobody?
---
Unless you're talking strictly about something that is literally poison, the word has lost all meaning thanks to people just using it to mean "thing I don't like".
---
Horde gets 3k+ honor from objectives alone, even if they lose. HKs aren't relevant in BGs.
---
So you lost the argument, really good of you to know when you are wrong.
---
Not exactly, most professional sports ban anabolic steroids, but that doesn’t make them illegal, just that you’re breaking your employment contract if you are found out.
---
Steroids in sports are more like botting or selling gold.
---
&gt;but with ~~a~~ **big** brain this time round.
---
you're not wrong, but also if anybodys going to be toxic in a video game i don't imagine a reddit post is going to change their mind
---
And then he'd be stomped by Naxx geared players.
---
you don't need put 100 hours into a character to know if you enjoy the class or not you people are being ridiculous, it is very simple, research the classes a bit, pick the ones you like and try them out, level them up a bit, if you're enjoying your class before you even reach level 40 (where most classes flesh out) then you'll like the class at 60, and what the 'class IS' is whatever you want it to be whatever you enjoy the most its a game remember, its all about enjoying your time playing, if you need to spend several hours on each class to find the class(es) you have fun playing then bloody well do it
---
Considering neither you nor the guy you were replying to understands that objectives are the main source of honor, I'd say that your thinking is more narrow than the people who have been figuring AV out for 10+ years.
---
But it took a year or two to get max level :)
---
I will have a list for people who are great, people not to group with and guilds to KOS. :)
---
If a BoE drops and you really need it. You should be willing to roll need on it against other people who need it.
---
There's also people who buy gold, does that mean buying gold is OK because oh man it sucks that some people would do it illegitinately and so everyone should. That's the exact same logic by the way, you're saying because bad actors exist that the only reasonable answer is that everyone becomes a bad actor.
---
You're good man. It's just funny cause I'm a min/maxxer. I fully intend to try and create the most optimal raid set up I can, but I understand reality isn't perfect and exceptions have to be made. I'd never turn someone down in a dungeon for playing a meme spec but when it comes to raiding multiple hours every week, the sad truth is that certain specs in Vanilla just suck. 
---
It's hard to invest a lot of time in to your class and DPS, trying your best every week, when Joe Shmoe the Ret Paladin is barely beating the tank. Raids are a team effort and playing on a team means making sacrifices to accomplish something.
---
Also, meme specs are for alt/farm nights! Much more fun and relaxed not having to worry about progression or DPS and everyone wins.
---
If the objective is honor why would the mega remain a 30-minute Zerg? Moron
---
How much? Maybe ill swing by Hobby Lobby after work.
---
Classic doesn't do that though. All the best pve classes also make up the best pvp classes.
---
You know there is altrac valley and bg's in classic coming in phase 3? World pvp ia unranked in phase 1, ranked under the honor system in phase 2 and from then on out you will be hard pressed to get rank 10 and above.
---
Random leveling players in wpvp is not what people are talking about when we talk about classic pvp. Its just one of the fun aspects you can do in the downtime between the real pvp grind.
---
Classic is not for you, and you should probably stop trying to "not insult anyone", because your elitism and the over the top belief in your own pvp abilities are bleeding through.
---
From my perspective you would be the guy we all crush both in duels and in bg's and you then complain you just had a bad class matchup or something.
---
So your argument is that you think I have no experience and that because you have experience with one approach, every thought towards the other approach must automatically be wrong?
---
I have healed in raids and I have downranked.
---
I also have cancel-casted, been sniped and sniped others while whack-a-moling.
---
I know what the benefit to downranking heals is. I mean I see it black on white in my Excel-Sheet.
---
What I criticized is that people seem to be only looking at DPM of downranked heals while disregarding mana regenerated outside of the 5-second rule and disregarding the DPS that can be dealt while regenerating mana.
---
That's why I felt that someone should do the math on that, which is what I just did.
---
In 5-mans the healer that heals in bursts when necessary and then wands until healing is necessary again will speed up the run significantly by requiring fewer mana-breaks and contributing to damage dealt.
---
I'm suggesting that the same thing would hold true on a larger scale aswell. All it needs is some coordination. If on average the combination of overheal and cast-cancelling is bigger than 50% it might aswell be done by half the healers being afk. But wouldn't it be better if they weren't actually afk and wanded instead and still would be ready for emergencies?
---
Essentially you haven't given any explanation as for why taking turns wouldn't work. All you've done is saying that because of an assumed lack of experience on my side, there's no merit to the math I've done.
---
That is the RP part of it. You have to specialize your character... You can't have your cake and eat it I suppose :P
---
This is the real mvp
---
1. They are "meeting stones", not "summoning stones".  So unless you have a Warlock, you have to run to every dungeon.
---
2. Class balance got hella fixed in TBC.  Protection Paladins are not viable tanks in Classic due to a lack of taunt.
---
3. No combat rating system.  Instead of gear having 17 Critical Strike rating, it will simply give you 1% crit.  That 1% crit is the same at any level.
---
4. Resistances matter a lot more in raids.
---
5. The level 58+ zones matter more, and you'll find more people to do some of the higher level stuff that got skipped in TBC.  In TBC, nobody was doing Dire Maul or Blackrock Depths, but they will in Vanilla.
---
So ridiculous that it doesn't deserve a serious reply
---
Sure. Plenty of place like this and you'll be the only one trying to do it.
---
You try to deceive us! You have said that you play a shaman named thex .
---
Okay, thanks for the insight
---
PM sent
---
They could, but then they would also be saying that Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria were superior to Classic.
---
Sub numbers were like IPhones—it was easy to go up because Blizzard was constantly expanding to new regions and building brand awareness.  Now the market is saturated, so it’s harder to constantly replace players.
---
The current version of the game isn’t ruined; it has flaws and strengths.  For some people, the flaws don’t outweigh the strengths.  The same will be true of Classic.  I’m looking forward to it, but I’m also excited to see what’s in 8.3 and 9.0.
---
This is funny, because Org, TB and UC are why I'd rather not play Horde.
---
The last thing I paid for (beyond subscription) was a race change back in cata.  I bet 75% of people who still play wow retail have never paid for anything beyond the sub.  
---
As for your wasted money argument, following your logic, you could argue that any time playing retail is a complete waste if you decide play classic.  That's not exactly how it works.   Most currently subbed players who play classic will still play their BFA characters when there is content they want to experience.   They will not delete all characters off their retail realms and dedicate their entire lives to classic.
---
It looks like the article is isn't accurate as many have noted that AV's "initials release" is *not* like it was in 1.12 which is what classic is getting. I'm pretty sure retail AV is likely going to be the same as classic AV.
---
I wouldn't really enjoy the AV games that lasted literal days. Though it may have been fun to do the old turn-in mechanics to summon the raid bosses. Hmm, I think allowing some tweaks to classic like changing AV would actually be welcome, but I think the #nochanges crowd would drown that out.
---
Yes, time goes on. Just like my emotional feeling towards arrogance. I can't properly say when you annoyed me more than the standard annoying comment, but that does not mean it wasn't there. There are certain times and states - even if the process until my eyeball (or going back to my annoyance-analogy - my brain) understood what happened.
---
If there wouldn't be an exact 12 then we'd have a skip at that point, which we don't. Yes there are many factors to ensure which moment exactly was 12, but that does not mean it doesn't exist.
---
I might not be able to explain it in English as well as you do, but that doesn't make your statement correct and mine wrong.
---
Thanks for the dialogue.
---
Dungeon finder isn't needed, it sucks. But summoning stones are the perfect middle-ground. Still need a few people to walk but not the entire team
---
Dishonorable Kills!
---
Hand of justice can kiss my ass!  Haha
---
I think I’ve seen two drop and I was no-lifing it for like two months :(
---
Yeah, it's more getting Judgement in BWL allows you to get some spell proc based builds more viable.
---
I couldn't decide on what to play. Only knew I wanted to play warlock and a tank.
---
Decided on the following:
---
Playing a Warlock when soloing
---
Duo-leveling a warrior when playing with a friend who I convinced to play a priest
---
Rolling undead or orc warlock (on-the-fly decision) and troll warrior (highest tps potential)
---
thats like your opinion man.
---
the stress test client is the actual classic client

You can Jump up the into the yards, safe via spell range and you can fear melee as they try to get up
---
$600 I suppose. Cheaper the better I have an alienware laptop and a desktop so just want a niche device.
---
You're not a jerk because you disagree.  You're a jerk because you made a claim, then refused to back it up and essentially called the OP an idiot because he couldn't immediately understand your claim without evidence.
---
Probably need to purchase a stock certificate for this type of information.
---
Class balance really is an unattainable thing in an mmorpg, unless you want every single class to be exactly the same. I like how Blizzard gave every glass a raid spec, PvP spec, and dungeon/mess around spec.
---
But the game developers created mod support so that people could develope 3rd party add-ons for people to use in the game. Blizzard has from day 1 supported add-ons in the game, and it was part of the design. The API was open for anyone to play with and people crafted some amazing add-ons.
---
However I will agree with you that some add-ons throughout the years have watered down the experience which is why I am going to go with very few add-ons setup for a better experience for myself. I am not however, gonna tell other people that their way of playing the game is "wrong". If Blizzard allows a part of the API open for add-on use, then that is a way you can *choose* to play the game.
---
I would echo the sentiment that 1/29/21 is probably the best "all around" spec as you get a lot of good healing and pvp talents and auto-root which, even with only 33% proc rate, will usually proc pretty quickly given how often rogues or hunters attack you.
---
One thing you will notice from the specs below though is basically that people are saying "here is the spec that will give you enough tools to heal". In comparison, I would point out that you could also have a loadout that says "here is the spec that will give you enough tools to tank/pvp.
---
1/18/32 gives you access to autoroot (which you should honestly always have) but also gives you 5/5 tranquil spirit, 5/5 gift of nature, 5/5 crit regrowth and swiftmend. The build i'm linking below also gives you the pvp talents plus 5/5 feral instinct plus 2/2 primal fury for tanking.

Now you may say, "wow, wouldn't it be nice to have thick hide?" - thick hide is a meme and is absolutely useless. You may also say "wouldnt it be great to have predatory strikes, blood frenzy, feral faerie fire, ravage, and HOTW" and to that I would say "yes of course it would be". What you have to remember though is that no one is going to be Shedo. Feral "DPS" is absolutely hot garbage in 5 man raids. Even when I had most of the best feral gear in the game, I would still regularly get out DPS'd by rogues and mages in 5 mans. You can (rightfully) say I must just suck ass, but the talent spec I have above is extremely useful for being a PVP healer as well, which is arguably a Druid's strongest role. If you want to PVP with your friends, being a feral druid who specializes in attacking, rather than healing, is likely not the right choice.
---
Food for thought.
---
All that matters is what it is worth to you. 10 bucks? 20 bucks? 100 bucks?
---
The more you say you will pay the more I may spend on materials, (Carboard vs foam vs posterboard vs ??) (Hand painting vs can spray vs airbrush colors) (Felt vs silk) (hot glue vs stitching).
---
Nothing is really stopping a guild from taking more.  But yeah, it was a big difference in a vanilla shadow priest (I was only running a priest alt, so I was Disc/Holy) to when I changed up to main Priest in WotLK and was topping the damage meters.
---
$600
---
Elemental Shaman
---
The worst was waiting an hour for a tank then waiting another 30 minutes for them to bother making it to the instance.
---
Silly reddit mobile
---
Blizzard never used that wording though. That was entirely mmo champs thing
---
I will be rolling orc shaman. I think IRC’s are badass and my other option would be troll but I cannot stand not being able to see feet armor. Idky but it really bothers me. Not to mention I love pvp and the orc racial is great.
---
Youtube -&gt; "wow classic class comparison" it'll be one of the first 5 videos for sure
---
Zero social prospects
---
I think you're entirely confused and I'm gonna chalk this one up to "I got offended by something you said, therefore I won't be using any further logic or reasoning in this conversation".
---
A sub. You could have easily searched and found this information.
---
Just a sub.
---
Cheers!
---
I’ve thought about it but that’s what I played in vanilla.. fuckin power house.
---
Lol vanilla ranks are about grinding, not skill 😂 We can compare arena ranks if you'd like. I'm a Gladiator who's beaten the Blizzcon champions with a meme comp. You?
---
Again, not being elitist but if you cloned yourself, I bet you I could 1v2 you. And that's me being objectively honest; not elitist.
---
Dull rotation plagues all RDPS in classic and id argue shadow is a better rotation than mage or warlock
---
Overused, but not wrong.
---
There are many classes and specs that can do well in both, but there are almost always ways to optimize one or the other.
---
I'd say mage is probably one of the better classes that can take a pve spec directly into pvp and be pretty solid still. I imagine most pve healing specs also work just fine in pvp, or you can probably play a pvp healing spec in raids without much trouble.
---
The biggest offenders are going to be classes where you want to play an entirely different role, such as healing/tank in raids and then dps in pvp.
---
Animations and aesthetics are a huge one for me. 
---
Always really like NElfs in WC3, but I think the NElf males in vanilla WoW looked clunky as hell, with weirdly fitting equipment, and awkward attacking animations.
---
Endgame lack of difficulty.
---
Still needs more bodies than defending the bridge
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if quests required you collect 5 times as much of something, but the fact that the drop rates are so low on some items like zevrha hooves and buzzard beaks is maddening when questing with friends. shouldnt every tiger have fur?
---
A lot of people enjoy smoking. Must mean it's good then.
---
Elaborate...
---
When it initially released, as in before all of the patches. Not that weird.
---
Ok, sorry you think you're entitled to a usable item.  But it just doesn't work that way.  It's cash to one person, a usable item to another.  That's just how it works when you're playing with strangers. 
---
Friends and guild members, a whole different story.  If you're doing it with friends you probably throw cash at each other.  If you're playing with a guild run, it's probably expected to have it passed on to you to progress the guild.
---
It all depends, but in PUG group context, you need a BoE.
---
Cheers
---
4-5 healers would obviously go OOM and be unable to deal with raidwide damage-spikes.
---
I'm not saying to use fewer healers I'm saying to use the healers more efficiently. 4-5 concentrate on healing while the rest does a little DPS and is there to help with spikes.
---
Once the 4-5 who concentrated on healing drop too low in Mana, they switch their roles.
---
Looking how Spirit and the 5-second-rule works, it seems like that might have been the intention of Blizzard afterall.
---
Especially considering how +Healing wasn't really a thing in earlier patches.
---
The addition of it allowed to ignore the entire point of spirit and still somehow make it. But when you look at the math, the point where taking turns with mana-breaks actually becomes worse seems to be much further down the line than where the lowest heal with full coefficient becomes the best in terms of HPM. And even if it eventually does, it still should be way more efficient to make people take turns with Healing/DPSing instead of having them compete over who actually gets the heal and who has to cancel/overheal.
---
people still type like this? genuinely asking
---
Warlock because I have the most experience with it.  Human because I don't want to be a Gnome (just personally) and faction because the community of gamers I play with for other games is solely Alliance but I came from Horde so it's like a new game to me.
---
My plan is to Level as a Prot Warrior, one of the reasons being able to simply say "Fuck You!" to all the people who say it is impossibly slow. However, I will have a steady playing partner (wife, boomkin/heal hydrid) so we will have the ability to AoE pull, me tank and her kill/heal, and we can insta-dungeon, since she can heal 5-mans or dps them, if there is another healer around. 
---
So with all that in mind, Prot Warrior won't be a big deal for me.
---
This is a very rudimentary forums. Nowhere near as in depth as the old vanilla forums before blizzard nuked it. No mention of a classic armory.
---
Have you considered going outdoors between August 27th and the end of time? If so, would you ever reconsider this decision?
---
The world does suck me in though
---
Why ask Google when you can expect another person to do the work for you?
---
Knowing that this is how it'll work going in helps. I didn't play at the time but if everything beforehand required 3-4 tanks, then suddenly this one fight is being done with 8, it's a shock. But if you know "hey in tier 3 there's going to be a fight requiring 8 geared warriors" you can be prepared when it releases.
---
I think the worst part of the honor system was the way it was structured gave rise to the “honor cartels” or w/e you want to call them.  It wasn’t that players were organizing to maximize their honor with other like minded players (no different than PvE raiding guilds).  
---
What bothers me is that it that it wasn’t rare for groups to devolve into prioritizing being able to commit time versus actual skill.  The rampant account sharing that went on.  There was such an emphasis placed on just being able to commit ungodly amounts of time.  It let people who had the skill level of an autistic sloth reach rank 14 by sheer virtue of putting in enough time with the honor group that they got their turn in the rotation.  Every server had at least a few people that were a running joke at being terrible at WoW but reached rank 14.
---
You can say the same about PvE content, where subpar players simply showed up for raids and got loot on that virtue alone.  I like to think in guilds that were at least at mid+ tier raiding that they got seeded out.  But that clearly wasn’t the case for most...
---
Word up! Only thing undead doesn't fit right with me is the Warrior. Like, you're a rotting bag of bones... Where's the strength and constitution in that!?
---
Thanks for that information but I read that an active subscription is needed to participate and I don't own WoW yet (or a running sub). I am totally new to WoW..
---
You're right. It is cash for one person and a usable item for another.
---
Greed is for cash, need is for use. If you ignore that, then the entire purpose of need or greed is immediately defunct.
---
Feral
---
I'm going Warlock cause I like the class mythology and also play one in D&amp;D.

NA / PVP / Alliance
---
We are &lt;TBD&gt; (will vote on final guild name prior to launch), an alliance guild on a medium-pop PvP server! We are a diverse group of former guildmates and friends that have been playing WoW together since the beginning of Vanilla. Altogether we have a wide variety of experience with vanilla endgame PvE content, as well as GM-level PvP. 
---
We expect low-drama and maturity from our guildmates.
---
**Raiding**
---
We are casually hardcore - our approach to raiding is a "less is more" mentality. We expect our raiders to come prepared to clear content, but we are looking to raid 2 nights per week. Raid times are still being finalized, but most likely will be 7:30-11 pm EST on Tuesday and Wednesday.
---
We will be finalizing looting rules, but it's safe to say we will land on some sort of DKP system (with legendaries and recipes being subject to loot council).
---
**Class Needs:**
---
We are currently recruiting all classes, but these classes are specifically in need:
---
- Warlock (High)
---
- Priest (Medium)
---
- Paladin (Medium)
---
**Join Up**
---
Please join our discord (https://discord.gg/ntx3xHf) to express interest - there is no formal application at this time, so drop in and look for server selection announcements!
---
The consumable grind
---
Hey I'm just wondering if you could tell me what we need to play classic? Do I need to buy bfa? Thanks
---
ahhh so \[like this\] \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoNY9UVr9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoNY9UVr9E)\] ?
---
I was getting ready for a BRD run.  We had 4 people, were looking for a 5th.  The only person complaining we hadn't started yet, was still goofing off in Winterspring.
---
To be fair, he did say "Classic will have 10 ***Millioon*** subscribers...on day 1."  
---
I think Millioon is not out of reach for Classic
---
I've seen 3 people defend the Horde base alone.
---
i heard that you don't need an active sub. you do need one?
---
I had this in 2005 with an addon.
---
From the latest interview with Brian Birmingham "We will continue to listen to community feedback, and we want to know what people think and want to see next." So the more we tell them what we want, the higher the chance.
---
Same, playing with model viewer + tier sets made ruling out a lot of class/race options easier.
---
Exactly
---
Im also playing nelf hunter ( wanted to play dwarf but shadowmeld is way to handy). Ive done afew leveling routes on private servers just so I dont waste too much time wondering where to go. 
---
Planning to sort my addons out on stress test.
---
Also I quit my job.
---
See TBC for example of better class balance while still having unique classes.
---
Don't be a smart allec
---
Sure, but anyone who didnt follow along since 2000-2005 and is only familiar with those genres as being associated with the earliest video game highlight videos will know it all as "techno" probably.
---
I didn't take it that far but I leveled as prot pally on Nost and it really was an amazing time figuring out how each unique group was going to have to use their skills to overcome the obstacles in dungeons. 
---
I got taken to a few raids but just as a warm body/raid buff. ZG was mostly doable as a main tank, the friends who brought me enjoyed figuring out each fight as we ran through it, but even then raiding in vanilla just isn't for me. The one part of retail that they have absolutely nailed is the raids and going back to their first attempts at it just isn't enjoyable personally.
---
I got to 40 on a mage on nost, mostly playing with a friend and his wife who were priest/warrior, it was still fun but there just wasn't the same puzzle to solve with every pull.
---
&gt;”They are bland and uninteresting”
---
This is a fact?  Sounds more like an opinion.
---
insert *depends on the context meme*
---
Glad you caught on 😂
---
I'm rolling a female orc but I identify as a human with an undiagnosed mental condition known as gender dysphoria. I'll be commuting suicide shortly after I transition and regretting it for my entire life.
---
Addons in 2005 already fixed this.
---
With regards to faction I personally didn't care if I went Horde or Alliance this time. However my friends are all going Horde so I will follow them.
---
Maybe you should use the stress test august 8th to try out for yourself what "feels right" when you are in game. 
---
I am just gonna play all classes to level 10, and whatever character I feel most attached to is what I am gonna level to 60.
---
Not offended at all; your post wasn't directed at me. 
---
I would have even agreed with you 100% if you had offered even a modicum of evidence to support your claim that the OP was wrong.  But you didn't.  Instead you essentially said "You're wrong because I said so."
---
How does that help anybody?  Especially the OP?  All you've done at this point is call someone wrong without telling them why they are actually wrong.  No proof means that the person is going to just STAY wrong without understanding why.
---
&gt;implying that because we are classic enthusiasts, that we need constant reminders not to be toxic (assholes)
---
It's has nothing to do with being classic enthusiasts, like you said, assholes are everywhere, so why wouldn't you want to minimize that behavior in the community we enjoy?
---
It's common knowledge not to be a dick, but sometimes you have to beat people over the head with an idea to get it through the thickest skulls.
---
The standard pve hunter spec does nicely in pvp.
---
There's loads of pvp priest specs that can be used to heal in.
---
SM ruin warlock is often used by pvpers to do both pve and pvp.
---
Deep frost WC mage can be used in pvp too, but you waste 5 points into WC which hurts the build quite hard in pvp.
---
Shaman can spec 30-0-21 elemental and still heal quite fine.
---
There's a paladin healer spec for both pvp and pve at the same time.
---
For druid there's a deep resto build that is used for Flagcarrying and ofc pve healing. 
---
I think that's about it. Basically if you want to rogue or warrior you HAVE to respec, the other classes has some options out there.
---
Imagine reading this post and making an actual life change.
---
What if I think they are both some of the worst versions of this game by far and easily beaten by TBC/Wrath/Mop, which pigeon hole am I going in?
---
Hard truth but classic is the side bitch here.  There's no way blizzard gives up the Trophy husband whose cash shop prints money.
---
I could give this a try, thank you!
---
Mage leveling is fantastic. Frost is the go to spec, especially if you’re doing AOE farming. 
---
Food and water at your disposal, eventually portals/teleports. Control, etc. 
---
Frost is the main spec for raiding/pve - considered by most.  Fire and arcane are absolutely doable, just less ‘efficient’.
---
Warlocks are fun. Unique skills/pets. Potion (health stone) at your disposal. You have soul stones which are great for leveling/dungeons and raids.
---
The main thing to think about is inventory space as it relates to soul shards. Some of your unique skills require it, and you’ll want to have a consistent supply which you can get from mobs/PvP when you kills others while channeling. Some think it’s tedious, others don’t find it as troubling. 
---
Priests - always will have a spot in dungeons/pvp/raids. 
---
You can level as shadow, and heal dungeons. You will not want to be in Shadowform.  It won’t be as ‘efficient’ as the other two classes. 
---
Priests are fantastic, people will always need you. Finding a group will be much easier. It may take longer to level - you can go disc/holy to level - solo’ing will take longer. 
---
—- 
---
All three are great, and bring something different. 
---
What do you want to do?
---
Be the highest on the DPS meters, give out food/water, and be praised for your portals?
---
Summon Demons and Rez when people thought you were dead to destroy them?  
---
Be loved by all, and bring something to a group that everyone will need?
---
A computer
---
Hopefully they will add sub-forums like classes etc. or it will be one big clutter. I already miss the Nostalrius forums
---
I'm not telling anyone it's wrong either. I'm apathetic on the issue. I was just pointing out the point of those arguing against addons, which is the same argument that's been made since Vanilla. And technically they got a good point, whether Blizz gave the thumbs up long ago or not.
---
Until you can download addons specifically from battle.net itself, or they're included in the installation of the game, or even added in a patch, then the argument can be made that regardless if Blizzard allows addons, you're still playing the game outside of how it was designed/intended. Also the game originally was not, and should not be balanced around addons or the assumption every player will use addons, but that's a different argument altogether.
---
Hey man please let me know when you find this information I absolutely can not find it ANYWHERE
---
I mean I didn’t try searching myself or anything, but I can’t find it
---
You've already answered your own question. Paladins. Dive into Paladins like your life depends on it. Immerse yourself in it, vanilla style. Mechanics, lore, fan art, game knowledge. Go off the deepend and turn yourself into the ultimate paladin enthusiast. This warcraft paladin lore video the other day got me (a 10 year paladin vet) hyper-pumped. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP5cQMItOoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP5cQMItOoU) . 
---
If you have to have a reason to play alliance, then here are my answers. 
---
1.) Paladins - See above. See [this](http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-4102.html) link for an unbiased (promise) comparison of Paladins vs Shamans.
---
2.) Stormwind and Ironforge are the closest capital cities to the instance nexus that is Blackrock Mountain, containing so many essential high level dungeons and T1 raids. 
---
3.) If you consider yourself a fan of traditional midevil tolken style fantasy then Alliance is easy to fit into. Replace elves with night elves, Hobbits with Gnomes and you've got yourself a  LoTR appearance.
---
I wouldn't want to remove World PVP.
---
Actually a brilliant move to sucker me in, strong marketing
---
Gold farming for consumes.
---
Ranks being tilted towards no lifers and account sharers
---
People enjoy gambling too. Doesn't mean it's ethical or good for them.
---
That's some shameful shit right there.
---
They were happening after the honor point change in late Vanilla.
---
We used to queue up with our overgeared MT and 3 healers and win games on our own in 8 minutes.
---
Once people could actually quantify the honor (honor points), more people on both factions just went straight for the objective instead of fucking around in the middle for fun.
---
I had to google shitposting- I can’t find a direct definition.
---
I'm definitely playing a priest first. Then a hunter. Those were always my two I played years ago. My problem is deciding on a 3rd lol. I'm thinking Druid or Paladin
---
half the fun of classic was the trial and error of learning your class
---
I’ll be rolling an Undead Warlock. 
---
They were one of the scariest sights for my alliance toons in actual Vanilla, and the fact I’ve played every class at a high level since Vanilla EXCEPT warlock means that’s what I’m taking this time around.
---
Those scumbags deserve it after years of shoving that asshole wall of no in my face.
---
God damn I remember that! That was some of the most fun I've ever had in BGs. I had no idea at the time that was the real reason.
---
Irrelevant anecdotal experience is irrelevant
---
Alliance base is measurably easier to defend
---
Let's just say the base ghetto cardboard model is 25 bucks (shipping and handling included). When you say best possible results I could always do something better. I already have a job so I would mostly do it for fun. I would say 100 bucks if you want me to really take my time and maybe use different materials or maybe even figure out how to get the eyes glowing. Ofc I would send photos of the finished product before any money changed hands.
---
You're weird.
---
I asked for recommendation because sharing wisdon and knowledge is saving time.
---
Yup, that's easy:
---
/targetmarker [@mouseover,mod:shift]7;[@mouseover,mod:ctrl]5;[@mouseover]8;0
---
Each number corresponds to that marker symbol, while 0 corresponds to "clear the mark". You will mark targets with mouseover, and if you select a target (and have no mouseover) you will clear the mark.
---
I usually have a macro like this on action bar 2 (which is hidden, because I prefer not to use floating action bars). I often rebind that to mouse 4 or V, something out of the way.
---
You are not the arbiter of what qualifies as "chump change" and what doesn't, what you're proposing is subjective nonsense.
---
0/30/21 (or 1/29/21) is the most versatile one, allowing you to heal and tank in dungeon/raid and to pvp.
---
I also like 14/32/5 to do good in both dps and tank : [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxbxsfbdtV](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxbxsfbdtV)

I like what it adds to the world, not actually getting dazed.
---
\&gt; Vanilla......some changes.......#nochanges
---
i am confused
---
Then what is a ninja?
---
There's a post they made somewhere a while back where they talked about it. They are some formulas for calculating how much hit you need depending on how much +weapon skill you have too, but idk where that is either.
---
Would be nice if that info was easy to find too, because idk how much hit you need as a human with Edgemaster's Gloves/Maladath :L
---
I'm on the fence with this, I can't really argue with either side that are for or against dailies. In BC it felt like there was plenty to do late game when you were already grinding end game content, but in vanilla if you dont like fishing/cooking the only thing to do between raids is grind gold for consumables/tiny upgrades like enchants. Obviously there is almost always something to work toward but if you only have one character and you are pve focused it kind of seems like there isnt a ton to do with your downtown, right? I primarily played during late BC/early Wrath, so I'm not arguing, merely asking: What do raiders do between raids?
---
Wow classic will definitely be implemented at release, how else would people play it :P?
---
Yeah **AV** won't be though.
---
After I saw the number 42 of Death Coil isn't aligned properly I couldn' stop seeing it ;_;
---
Warning: the following text is composed 100% of a random internet persons opinion.
---
Pick 1 main.  Don't make the mistake of trying to keep 2 characters up to date.  You want 1 character as geared as you can manage, not 2 characters with okay gear.  However, if you have a lot of play time - it is feasible to have a well-geared alt, but (IMO) you shouldn't gear an alt at the expense of your main.  
---
When I was doing hardcore progression raiding in TBC, there were officers in my guild who held the view that a player should only have 1 main character and dedicate all of their playtime to perfecting their ability with that class.  It's a pretty extreme point of view that not a lot of people have.  For most people, this is not necessary at all - but I still do believe that you should only focus on 1 main.  Alts are for fun outside raids, and to support your main through professions.
---
&gt; I personally know a guy who did it with 4
---
No you don't.  Not at 60 in Vanilla.
---
Being an "Influencer" is actually a sign of the changing times in the modern world.  It's almost a totally new job due to the growth of technology that gives more people a platform to be influential in their own area of expertise.
---
Some of the QoL things like clicking each fucking thing when you have a ton of stuff in the mail, posting a ton of stuff to AH, etc
---
Anything that has to do with how much time is spent getting to 60 or preparing for raid or farming is a detriment, but things that make your time in cities faster is good imo. 
---
The goal, it may come as a surprise for most of us, is NOT to sit in IF or org looking sexy, although that's a nice side bonus. Main goal is to be accomplishing things in the world, so less time spent in my mailbox or inside the AH window, the better.
---
Well like I said, there is no such thing as a spec that is 100% optimized for both pvp and pve. It doesn't exist. The beauty of this type of talent system is that there are small choices you make depending on the type of content you are tackling. For example, Shatter is useless in a raid because a boss cannot be frozen. It's awesome in pvp and world exploration, and pretty strong in dungeons too.
---
As for mage, I am thinking of deep frost specs or arcane based specs. You will have to make some tradeoffs, but the pvp and pve variants are not that different. Winter's Chill, for example, is only necessary for 1 mage in a raid. You don't *need* Arcane Meditation or Arcane Focus or Improved Arcane Explosion for most raids. You can take some points out of Permafrost in pvp. Maybe you are entirely fine without Frost Channeling. You just pick and choose what you can live with and without.
---
Had to scroll far to find this one. Definitely engineering for me too.
---
Leaving aside all the jokes, whoever considers that the potential Classic player base is small, or niche, is living outside the realm of reality.
---
I have no idea what is the most likely scenario. Nobody have. However, educated guesses can be made. And my personal one is that between 10% of the former WoW players from the last 15 years (that includes the current BfA players) and around 20% of the former Vanilla, TBC and Wrath players are the potential market for Classic, which is between 13 million (10% out of 130 million WoW players from 2004-present) and 14 million (20% of the former 70 million WoW Vanilla+TBC+Wrath players).
---
Now, those percentages might sound big, but they aren't actually that big. Even if we go on the lower end, 5% of the entire WoW player base from 2004-present, and only 10% of the former 70 million Vanilla+TBC+Wrath players, we STILL end up with 6-7 million people.
---
My own expectation is that between 6 and 10 million players will actually play Classic, out of a potential market of 130+ million former and WoW players.
---
Not even considering the players from outside WoW, which are also number in millions, most likely tens of millions, that are hungry for an old MMORPG. Yes, their percentage will be much smaller, probably 1%, but 1% out of tens of millions is still hundreds of thousands of players.
---
The most likely scenario is that Classic will have much more players than Blizzard expects. There will be millions...how many millions? God knows, but it will be closer to the highest possible 10 million mark than to the lowest possible 2 million mark.
---
The problem is, Blizzard doesn't want Classic WoW to be standalone. They don't even want it to succeed. They loathe the idea of classic and don't want to put any resources to it. They are launching with the bare minimum amount of work or effort into it. Lmp
---
okay
---
You can test it yourself if you have an active sub on 8/8 during the classic stress test. Going improved ambush gets you faster kills, especially if you use combo points on evis and not kidney. You’ll bandage and eat more though. Great in pvp and especially wpvp.
---
I have no problem paying you 150 if you get the eyes glowing!!!
---
Eh I never really found it terrible being a hunter in vanilla and bc. Kept the quiver full, with spare ammo in one of the other bags with some meat to keep the pet fed. As long as you didn't let your pet die and go too long without food it wasn't even that stressful of a time. 
---
I mean yea it sucked only having 2 bags for storage plus the backpack but eh i made sure to always distribute materials fairly often to my bank alt that space etc. was an issue.
---
I don’t care how easy mechanics are. If it can be messed up, someone will mess it up. There’s always that one mage that you explain to that they need to sheep moon, and will for a pull of 2, then go right back to being lazy
---
Ehhh, semantics.
---
What does that mean, final hit?
---
holy shit why was I so dumb trying to argue on reddit, my bad.
---
Elemental shaman is arguably the overall strongest pvp class/spec in the game. Shadow priest or SL warlock is the best 1v1 class.
---
So no, not really.
---
I think we deserve it, but we aren't entitled to it. It would be the right thing for Blizzard to do, but they don't owe us shit.
---
How do you decide which classes are "best for pve"?
---
You want every single class in your raid, and even if we use the example of druids which are mediocre healers and mainly brought for utility/buffs, they EXCEL in dueling/WSG.
---
Now if you meant specs, you'd be flat out wrong. As he just mentioned, ele is god awful in PvE but possibly the greatest burst class in PvP.
---
cool
---
I think a mage would be a blast just for the fact that your a rolling train that has no brakes. Warlock is kinda of meh for me. Like it would be fun but I’m also not crazy about the class as a whole but I hate getting rolled by them and as far as priest. I think priests are bad ass. I’m pvp they will melt your face. But, I’m not convinced I will enjoy leveling one.
---
Little early to be a dickhead, don't you think?
---
&gt;but sometimes you have to beat people over the head with an idea to get it through the thickest skulls.
---
Is this a "toxic" thought?
---
Can't wait for Classic launch to test it out by myself, I didn't receive a beta invite
---
DM won’t be out for a while after release
---
Like I answered to another comment, I'm no game devs but I'm 100% sure you can create a system more interesting.
---
For exemple rank 1-11 being a big grind (longer than current but with no decay) and rank 12-14 you need to have a very win ratio in BG over a large number of game to advance or something like a BG against the other faction to validate the rank or a tournament of some sort every month where the winner get the rank (it's just random ideas and have probably weakness but my point is just to say that you can have something hard to get and more fair)
---
This makes me feel polite for fucking with lowbies on my hunter. Trap lowbie hunter and fear his pet into shit? Polite. viper sting every lowbie caster you see? Polite. frost trap with entrapment on the docks while people try to get in boats? You'd better believe I'm being polite.
---
In early WoW, Master Looter was pretty buggy, sometimes you couldn't give an item to a particular raid member. To avoid this bug, many progression guilds left loot on Free-for-all. 
---
A ninja-looter was usually someone who looted everything off the boss while DKP or rolls were being sorted out. Sometimes it would also apply to a skinner who got the Hide of the Beast without rolling for skinning rights or anyone who rolled straight N on BoP items they can't use - but usually it involved looting the whole raid boss for yourself.
---
I'm a rogue so fuck you.
---
&gt; which FORCES you to learn your class, inside and out. Anyone else  looking forward to class integrity being an expectation rather than a  rare treat? I know I sure am.
---
I think you will be disappointed. There were enough bad players back in the day and not a lot who really knew how to play their class, but we had to talk with each other and help each other out way more than in the current game.
---
&gt;Mages are really good at PvP and pve with one spec pretty much all through to naxx, maybe switching to fire at one point.
---
This just isn't true though? Pvp frost and pve frost look completely different, not to mention most of your mages will be ap frost before speccing fire.
---
Wouldn’t it be better to move the point from something else other than HOTW since that’s the key talent?
---
Yea, you piercing to slow and then run away. While the mobs chase you, you're yelling heeeelp which is hilarious
---
Private server people, known for world pvp and ganking low levels
---
I don't think the difference between a class ability and a racial ability is an example of semantics.
---
No
---
But people overuse the words "asshole", "dickhead", ect, in the same way. They're literally just synonyms. Are we upset that language has adopted a new term?
---
You can try it on 8/Aug in the global stress test ;)
---
There's a lot you can do to grind for gold.  But really it just leaves you free to take part in whatever you want.  PvP, AH/market, Alts, professions, etc. 
---
You generally don't get the feeling of "I don't have anything to do..."
---
Hell yeah dude. Miss these videos and songs from classic. Cranius is worth checking out for those who want some more nostalgia

 **&lt;Cyrus&gt; | Alliance | EU PvP**  
---
Cyrus was founded over ten years ago back in early 2009, and has enjoyed success in MMO's such as Warhammer Online, Aion, Rift and World of Warcraft. Originally a PvP guild, over the years we learned to appreciate the joys and drama of raiding - and some of us have even learned to stop standing in the lava. You can read more about our history at the link below:
---
[https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/](https://www.cyrus-gaming.com/history/)
---
Following something of a general lull in the MMO scene over recent years, we are now beyond hyped to be turning the clocks back and recapturing our wasted youths in World of Warcraft Classic. It's not often you get a second go at things in life, so while we might not still fit into the same pair of skinny jeans we did 15 years ago, we are certainly going to take this opportunity by the horns and throw ourselves into some classic old-school guild life!
---
Thursday – Dependant on progress
---
We will also organise Battlegrounds and World PvP nights.
---
Cyrus is a focused, progression-based guild for mature, skilled and team-orientated players. We have a long-established leadership committed to getting the most out of our members and ensuring everyone is working towards their own and the common goals of the guild.
---
Our raid schedule reflects that of a more grown up / responsible lifestyle, but we still expect members to be highly active, to participate in other guild activities and to ensure they are fully stocked and ready for when it's go time. You’ll need a thick skin, a good sense of humour, the discipline to know when to speak up, when to shut up and the dedication to constantly improve.
---
Any questions? Feel free to reach out to us on here or discord:
---
You would think that in a solved environment trying more challenging routes would be more interesting.
---
I'll have more respect for the prot pally who manages to get himself a thurderfury tanking the content than the nth copy pasted optimal raid strat guild that breezes through content.
---
Flying mounts, and the abandonment of previous content.
---
TBC was when the "low level zones don't matter" trend started. There was no longer any real reason to spend time outside of TBC areas.
---
The quest is annoying and out of the way if I recall.  Everyone that skips it is trying to rush to 60, so in their mind it's something that can be completed later.
---
When you install WoW, does it include a packet of Addons?
---
Can you download Addons directly from Battle.Net/Worldofwarcraft.com/Blizzard.com?
---
No?
---
Then they're not core, even if the SUPPORT for them is.
---
WoW is MEANT to be played with addons
---
If that were the case, DBM/Titan Bar/Questie/Totem Timers/Sexy Map etc etc etc would be already applied in-game the moment you boot it up.
---
Oh trust me people will still suck
---
People would lose their shit if blizzard brought back the original version of daze. It used to be that any mob could daze you regardless of level, meaning level 60 you would be dazed and dismounted by a level 1 mob in the starting zone.
---
Hi ballsdeep, I'm ~~dad~~ jealous 2 weeks wtf.
---
I’m horde for life but even I swoon over IF.
---
Two weeks /played, maybe
---
Sorry - fuck all these nay sayers I want to know how it does as well. Esp with them losing so many subs over time. I don't think we are any more entitled to it than we were classic wow but I am damn curious as to its success. Could be used as an argument to adopt the old philosophies etc.
---
Can't have that and windfury at the same time tho.
---
&gt; The only way to 60 is a long ass grind, which FORCES you to learn your class, inside and out.
---
If only that were true. So many long nights of wiping in easy ass dungeons to bosses with 1 mechanic would have never happened. Having to explain to people why they shouldn't keyboard turn in *Naxxramas* wouldn't have happened.
---
There are still going to people who don't know wtf they're doing, it doesn't matter how simple or complicated an encounter or class is. Classic's environment just demands more patience for those people because of how much longer it is to do stuff, how much more difficult it is to replace people.
---
Yes, you do.
---
They already said months ago there will not be a classic armory.
---
The retail community does not give new players a chance to learn. Want to try tanking at lvl 30? Be ready for a bunch of impatient dps pulling mobs for you. 
---
Bad at healing? Kicked
---
Bad at dps? Kicked.
---
When people complain they are told to find a guild...
---
So you now need a premade group just to find courteous and patient human beings?
---
Level a warlock.
---
If you honestly believe that a reddit post telling people to play nice will change the attitude of toxic players...bruh.
---
**Looking For**: A semi-hardcore raiding guild for my fiancé and I. We'd prefer RP-PVP if available, otherwise a PVP server if not. We're fine with either faction but are leaning Horde. We expect to be available 6-11 PM PST on weekdays, all day on weekends and are fine playing with late-night EST/CST guilds as an option.
---
**About Us**: We're both working professionals and long-time WoW players. I (26/F) started playing WoW in BC and have raided casually as every role and almost every class through Mists. He (33/M) played WoW since release and has been in server-first competition guilds in both BC and WotLK playing priest and later DK until Legion. We're both highly skilled and competent players, although he is admittedly the better of both of us. We also have raided in other MMOs (RIFT, FFXIV, GW2) and competed together in FPS games.
---
**Classes:** Because this is our "last hoorah" playing MMOs we're pretty non-negotiable on our class choices and are not planning on rolling alts. I'm playing a Druid, MS/OS Resto/Cat with ideally transitioning to fully cat or bear if progression to BC is confirmed. He's currently deciding between Warrior, Priest, or Druid depending on what is needed.
---
They’ve nerfed relative health and damage of mobs several times from BC through MoP. I’ll go find a change log
---
You can't afford to take it from anywhere else. Hotw being the bottom of the feral tree means it needs all of the points above it as prerequisites. And you only go exactly as far into resto as you need to get Nature's Swiftness. So you either drop NS to 0/1 and don't get it, or you go 4/5 HoTW and just have a bit less stats.
---
I would argue that assholes **are** what's wrong with this world ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I like the "pen and paper" idea you brought up, I think it really is spot on. Every example of a healthy addons I can think of follows this simple outline. Questie, Atals, Gatherer, are all things I would have likly printed out back in the day or would have up on a second monitor if not for the addons today.
---
The guild I was in would have people in and out through the duration, and we would just ask if it was still going. A lot of time not much progress had even been made in between my breaks. I was a teenager at the time and really only logged to sleep for a few hours and would get back on and into the same ones
---
That makes total sense, I won't have this problem at all because I'm casual and an alt-aholic, so I'll be levelling a warlock for pve and a rogue for pvp (around the time that BG phase drops) and it will take me forever to get either, much less both, to 60. I was just wondering what life looks like as a 60 raider where your primary focus is more raid gear so youre always ready to jump back into Naxx or whatever, but you don't like pvp, and dont have alts.
---
You said that "Warriors are one of two classes that can reduce healing in a target". Priests are a third class that can reduce healing, as long as they're a troll. Not all trolls can use Hex of Weakness, only priests, and you train it at a priest trainer, so it's a priest ability.
---
I don't think TBC removed any class fantasy, and the balance was a million times better than vanilla, with some exceptions (looking at you Shadowbolt/Bloodlust)
---
A lot of guides recommend skipping it along with not investing in a number of skill ranks. Getting seal form is quite annoying but I think it's fun to include as part of the journey. I bought every rank of my skill as I went and even though I was often broke, I was still able to get my mount around level 40 as well.
---
Actually I think this is a pretty big deal. I wonder if any pservers ever got rid of the limit and what some of the meme specs looked like.
---
"Magically-lucky person XXXX has to enter the instance first to seed good loot for us. OH SHIT, YYYY went in first? You fucker, your seed is awful. May as well  just reset it now so we don't do all this work for trash loot."
---
Log in, play until level 25-30. Log out.
---
You're completely viable with one spec.
---
I respect that, especially as a rogue.
---
Might have a million on release week.
---
About 50-100k  a month in.
---
Did so last week
---
eh you're right ! long time no play x)
---
&gt; Rogues are the same deal except you're able to skip mobs so they're a little bit faster.
---
I'd say Rogues aren't nearly as bad to level as Warriors and Paladins. They have much better survivability then Warriors and also faster killing times in my opinion. I'm not really gonna compare them to Palas since Palas simply suck at leveling because they deal no damage have no decent pulling ability and also very little mana reg.
---
Energy is much better resource than rage for leveling since it allows a Rogue to deal damage immediately while a Warrior has to build rage before they can actually start to deal damage. 
---
Stealth is extremely useful to skip mobs and avoid ganks. Their CDs allow them to almost always get away from dangerous situations. Their main disadvantages are lack of sustain and lack of options vs multiple mobs. If you use first aid and stay away from mobs that are more than 1-2 levels above you rogue isn't too bad though.
---
I agree that Priest are faster levelers though.
---
Sure, but if you were level 60, you weren't gonna aggro those mobs.
---
MIN/MAX OR GTFO!
---
Anyone with an active sub can play.
---
**hunter rolls need on ironfoe** 
---
"You motherf... wait, what would OP do? It's ok, bro, we were all new once"
---
Class/spec balance
---
Honorable mention: lackluster boss mechanics during raids ... though that is really minor since the challenge is to herd 35 kittens instead of boss mechanics.
---
I agree great video. However 15 years since release and BC came out 12 years ago.
---
That's not the way I remember vanilla.
---
IF is still packed. Closest route between bank/mailbox and AH.
---
No, consistent r14 rankers find it flawed too.
---
The people praising it usually don't understand how fucked the gameplay is going to be - it's all about faction politics, waiting for your turn, and dodging premades all day.
---
But to anyone reading, you can still play normally and enjoy the ranking system up to like r11.
---
  Have you looked at the mage pve specs and the mage pvp specs? They are totally different. I’m guessing the only reason you think mage can do well in pvp is because you play warrior but mage pve specs are really bad for pvp. You don’t have Iceblock/Coldsnap/Shatter/Premafrost/imp coc/ice barrier/max arctic reach. Basically every pvp oriented talent in the frost tree is not taken for a pve spec.
---
I had to put this into my mind. I think that with streaming, youtube, tons of easy information, everyone is only thinking about min/max char speedruning and just forget to have fun and go along with the game. I went crazy not knowing what to play "omg i wont fit anywhere and everyone gonna do better" and forget that a lot of players are learning too, so just take it easy, the experience will be amazing and if i get bored, just reroll and thats it.
---
But yes, it was hard to take this rushy thing off my mind
---
in vanilla I was orc fury warrior. This time around im going human prot warrior instead.
---
Well, over 130 million people played WoW at some point, with over 70 million of them being players from Vanilla, TBC and Wrath.
---
10% out of those 75 million is 7.5 million players.
---
It's not 9 out of 10...you are confusing numbers here mate. It was never about concurrent players, but total players.
---
It's a mere 15% of former Vanilla+TBC+Wrath players to get to 10 million players in Classic. And it's around 7% of the former WoW players from 2004-present, to get to 10 million players in Classic.
---
Not an unlikely scenario, where you talk about 7%, or 10% or 15%.
---
And you are so sure about this because...?
---
I think that's the plan
---
Originally wanted a tauren, but I'm more likely gonna go orc
---
+ a lot of these questions are just attempts at socializing and Sharin da passion of da game with people who spend just as much time as you do just waiting for classic &lt;3
---
I’m thinking it’s tongue in cheek...or I hope it is...
---
Man I miss my 21" multisync. 1600x1200 was glorious in 2002.
---
Yup same here, I was going to post this until I saw this.
---
MMO champion is a cesspool of classic hate. They outright banned talk of classic wow for *years* until Blizzard did an official announcement.
---
Their hatred for classic never died though, and it definitely still shows.
---
Well yeah, but the differentiating factor between rank 10 and rank 14 has nothing to do with skill or strategy. Ranking up is based PURELY on time committed. While end-game raiding certainly requires a serious time investment, there is still.. ANY element of skill, which high warlord lacks. 
---
i mean, I'm not saying its game breaking or anything. But it was without a doubt a stupid system. I enjoyed it at the time and I plan to enjoy it again.. but it could have been better.
---
Again, failing to see the point.
---
Believe it or not, Im suggesting hordies might want to win as well.
---
He doesn't mention comments, I imagine he means streamers and some people he may of played with etc. It's definitely a thing, same with the low and slow players. Different stroke, different folks.
---
Sorry man, but that's not accurate at all. I remember one of the popular WoW Classic streamers did an example of how bad you can perform in Retail (Sorry can't remember his name - Anyone know?). His plan was basically to do nothing in raids and actually try to see how fast he could get kicked. Purposely taking damage etc, not attacking. Even though he was literally doing nothing, nobody noticed and he actually finished some of the raids. It was the same for instances.
---
Haha, didnt even notice it. I didnt create this btw.
---
Looks like the right color.
---
I'll have you know I take "killing them with kindness" quite literally
---
Wouldn’t a racial ability be an ability given to the entire race? Hex of Weakness is an even more rare ability, because it’s a class ability (Priest) only available to one race (Troll) that rolled that specific class. So you have to be a Priest first and foremost, and a Troll beyond that!
---
Except TBC class balance was actually way worse- especially in the atmosphere of a 25man.
---
Every class was needed to be optimal in a 40 man raid- whereas you didn't even take mages in sunwell.
---
Trying to make every spec equally good at everything is impossible- what it does is shaft the "pure" role classes unless they are unequivocally the best or make every role the same.
---
Lol, I play em all, all the time. No such thing as a main for me. Never will.
---
Grappled. The word you are looking for is grappled
---
&gt; oh lord please don't make me be misunderstood
---
This is such a great song. I used it as background music in my finale of my P&amp;P campaign I was GMing, it really gets the blood pumping:)
---
Thanks! Same server works to. A whole continent can crash, or you can nust randomly crash and get stuck in a queue.
---
No, the showtooltip command will display the cooldown. My macros try to display the relevant cooldown. Take my charge/intercept macro, for example. If I'm in Berserker Stance, it will display Intercept's cooldown. If I need to check the cooldown of Charge, I just tap shift (and this can be done during a GCD since longer cooldowns don't display it). For macros with multiple abilities, but only one has a cooldown, I tend to keep that tooltip displayed with no modifiers. Conversely, if a macro has multiple cooldowns, but one is significantly shorter (5-30 seconds vs 2 minutes), I tend to display the short cooldown. 
---
Obviously you should fine tune your layout for yourself. You may want to have the icons sitting in floating action bars so you can see each cooldown individually. I find that to be too distracting, and prefer to only see the cooldown I'm interested in when I glance down.
---
With macros like mine, you could fairly easily use action bar 2 instead of 1 as your primary bar, which wouldn't change between stances. I have mostly the same macros in the same places, but the one or two button differences make it worth using the stance specific bars.
---
In vanilla wow most people didnt know anything at all even tho they leveled to 60 and cleared a bunch of raids. In BFA you are forced to know about your class and how to play it if you want to do anything thats considered hard, like high rating arenas / m+ etc.
---
People will still wipe in MC in full preraid bis. 5mans will wipe.
---
All of the theorycrafting is done both for BFA and classic aswell, and there really isnt that much difference except you will acctually not be able to get your full raid bislist in classic every tier making people potentially worse at the game since they might not know how to adapt to not getting the right drops, whereas in BFA you can just go any other difficulty to get the very same item effect.
---
In what, LFR and LFG? If it is the brainless level content, maybe.
---
Vanilla had over 25 million players. The peak was 7.8 million concurent players in Vanilla.
---
WoW had over 130 million players. 
---
You are not looking at the right numbers. Concurrent players is irrelevant here. Only total players count.
---
And total players is over 25 million for Vanilla alone, and over 130 million for WoW in its entirety.
---
10 million is a very realistic number.
---
But asshole and dickhead mean exactly what they mean. They have no other definition. Toxic meant "poisonous" for hundreds of years before people decided to start using it to mean "bad" even though poisonous could already be used in that context. Why toxic as a word got so popular, I don't know. I just see it as a red flag that someone doesn't actually have a point to make, they just don't like something.
---
Not upset, it's just boring and dumb. Like how people literally use literally all the time, literally, to mean literally anything, even things that literally aren't literal.
---
It's pretty much this.
---
Want me to share my essential guide? 6 pages and covers everything including the viable methods of gold farm as a priest
---
Has anyone tried to use the Classic Connection part but you're server isn't listed?
---
I started in November 2004 prolly about a week after launch and I played a PVE server called Dalaran, however it not listed in that category.
---
Anyone else have a similar issue with trying to find their server in those list?
---
You have to walked East through Mulgore and through the Barrens, then at NE Barrens you can cross the bridge into the back entrance of Org
---
Trying way too hard bruh.
---
Can you give some examples? Sounds interesting

Ah yes I thought you meant cola, cocaine is very good for you

I’ve decided on a Hunter, but still swaying about the race. Nelf would be nice for shadowmeld + I like their zones. But then again I like dwarves better for RP reasons.

---
If you're playing ap frost, you don't have frostbite, cold snap, shatter, imp coc, ice block or ice barrier.
---
If you're playing deep frost, you don't have frostbite, shatter, imp coc or imp cs.
---
If you think that's viable, we have very different definitions of the word.
---
Hmm i don’t know what to pick. Troll male or female for mage.
---
Have children to boost sub numbers in the future is the end game!
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, but where are you getting your numbers that 130,000,000 people played wow at some point?  That number sounds about 10 times too high.  If that number is correct, then 10 million isn't unrealistic - but I seriously doubt 130 million people have had a WoW account at some point in the last 15 years.
---
Run forest run
---
TB -&gt; Barrens going North -&gt; East at Crossroads -&gt; North to Orgimmar
---
It's fine if it is what you really want to play. Demand for healers in general in raids is high enough that it's not in any way an issue to get a guild or even find a pug except for at the very top end of guilds. Imo they have very clunky mechanics and a small toolkit which makes it hard to deal with sticky situations in dungeons. However, they have very strong throughput (untill they OOM) and feel a lot better to play once you get some gear. People worry way too much about dungeons when the truth is that you outgear them very very quickly. If resto druid is what you really want to play then I say skip the priest and go for it. And that's coming from someone who's planning to play priest.
---
Subscribe to retail on your bnet account, you will have access to classic, you don’t need to buy B4A
---
Yeah, now we can all hide behind alts instead.
---
I think the idea is one option is opted into while the other is an option by default. Ie you make a game thats supports addon/mod as an addition, vs the inate ability of a digestive system to breakdown and/or incorportate steroids.
---
70 million? Wtf are you talking about. Thats not how it works at all. You dont just add up the population peak of every expansion and add it together. 
---
The rest is just rambling about made up numbers because you dont understand that most of the population is included in the next expansions peak population amount
---
I’m just being silly

---
I'm ambivalent about achievements. I like achievements that provide some sort of reward (even if it's just the achievement) for uncommon/difficult accomplishments. For example, if you clear the Gold Proving Grounds in the wrong spec (e.g., clearing the DPS Gold Proving Grounds as a healer), then you get the [[You're Really, Really Doing It Wrong]](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=9597/youre-really-doing-it-wrong) achievement. There's no other reward. Just a silly achievement.
---
High effort silly

Yes you need an active sub on the 8th to participate in the stress test
---
Timezones, you haven’t heard of them?
---
I used to love seducing people with my succubus and deathraying them in the face.  Most times it was so so, but when it crits...good lord.
---
We once had three warlocks levelling at about the level 30 mark when a 60 Tauren warrior tried to gank us.  We seduced him and all three hit him with death rays, one of them critting. D E L E T E D C O W . E X E
---
Both in Vanilla, both so stupid I remember them after all those years:
---
"You healed yourself, that's cheating!" after a duel on my druid.
---
"You pet's damage doesn't count as your damage. I have more DPS!" on my hunter after a dungeon run.
---
Im in same position. I wanna heal so bad. But i wanna play the least rolled class...prolly pally ok. But i used to play druid main...i have to main a druid. But the mage was the very first class u rolled too and god was it fun playing pvp and BLINK man. I could go on for days i feel like, cause i wanna play every class again. The point is i still dont know what i wanna roll or alt even. Enjoy it like we did the first time around. When it launches...ULL KNOW
---
So dumb
---
&gt;Bonus honor in AV is a finite resource from objectives.  
---
&gt;If you cap all bunkers/towers, that's maybe 4k honor. When you've capped the bunkers/towers you can, you get nothing out of the game dragging any further - unless you win, which adds a little bonus on top.  
---
&gt;HKs are barely worth anything unless you're soloing people, and the honor you get diminishes per kill.  
---
&gt;Because of this, both the losing and winning side benefits from the fastest possible games, since you still have time to cap the majority of objectives within those 20-30 minutes.
---
The point is that on average you'll gain far more honor/hour letting alliance win, than you would trying to stall them and win yourself. It's that simple.
---
If you have god-tier groups that can win against allies in the same amount of time it would take to lose, of course you'll try to win. But you're still just going to be rushing past each other.
---
first hit.
---
Person to hit a mob first in (almost?) any way gets the "tag" for the mob.
---
When the mob dies, the person who tagged the mob first has control over the loot on the mob.
---
So you have a lot of tagging wars for certain world bosses.
---
You can reset the tag on a mob if you leash/reset the mob by running far enough that it runs back to its path....
---
So it gets... interesting...
---
I don't think people realize how much this will be a problem in raiding. 16 debuff slots for 20 people is already nuts, but that same amount for 40 people is just insane.
---
I can already hear the drama about who put up curse of agony and who has deep wounds.
---
This is my favorite thing about vanilla. classes don't feel flavourful in retail. warlock is just a mage who throws purple fireballs.
---
This is the official Thex and friends guild. Anyone is welcome to join up whether you're new, experienced, young, or old. We are founded off of the following beliefs.
---
"Without the weakest link, we are unbound"
---
"Alone we are strong, together we are mighty."
---
"Before honor comes sympathy."
---
Our goal is to become a well known guild that strives to be excellent allies. Players outside of the guild should regard us as honorable, kind, helpful, and above all, stalwart defenders of the Horde and it's people.
---
The guild will focus on a sense of community while following a weekly raid progression. Likewise, we will be forming PvP groups for fun in the battlegrounds and consistent world pvp. No commitments required.
---
who is to blame? Mom or wife?

Your type of post is so common here and his references directly to the sub, not twitch or yt, is very clearly pertaining to comments/posts
---
Just do it.  join a casual levelling guild and have some fun.  Who cares if you aren't 60 until phase 2 or 3?!?  We will all be leveling alts and people will be running MC.  Also it seems like the average play time to 60 is somewhere around 6 to 7 days of played time so roughly 3 hours played per level. so you could be 60 in less than 3 months even playing super casually.  
---
Also you know there will be the odd couple of days a month where you will get to play for an extended period of time
---
Which is everyone in TBC

Far more than anyone else I know. I wasn't around the first time my favorite game of all time came launched. This (official blizzard servers) won't launch a 3rd time. I am diving into this as if my life depends on it with all cylinders firing to maximize this two time event for the ages. I started playing vanilla servers about a year before classic was announced right after nostalrius was shut down.
---
1.) Spent about $2,000 on new computer setup (need of an upgrade but my old system would have made do.)
---
2.) Revamped and relearned my keybinding setup to an extreme method that was very difficult to get used to but would be far better in the longrun. Did a variation of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KmZBU5Hf0M) . 
---
3.) Practice speed leveling and vanilla wow in general on private servers.
---
4.) Trained myself to practice binge game 14 hours straight without naps. Get into the habit of healthy pre game practices (workout, shower, text loved ones that all is well, I'm not dead, don't come over to visit, feed pet, make final preparations before 14 hour game marathon).
---
5.) Self reflect on whether I want to be a guild leader or not, as it is great undertaking that I do not take lightly.
---
6.) Watch a metric ton of youtube to research what I can't learn in game on private servers.
---
7.) Ask off for 3 weeks vacation a few hours after wow classic release date was announced.
---
8.) Gather like minded individuals that I can trust to play WoW classic with me in cohesion (somehow this one is the hardest).
---
9.) Spend the final month (now) not playing WoW at all as to reset my burnout meter to zero.
---
I. Am. Ready.
---
These tell us nothing as Classic is a unique release, not just another expansion. 
---
I believe 10 million on launch day is possible, but I'd be shocked if it's more than 2 million after a month.
---
I remember the first time I saw a horde player was in stv. I had started alliance and was such a noob. 
---
I think it was male troll shaman and my eyes could barely process what I was seeing. I could tell it was not an npc due to how it was moving.  I just couldn’t fathom it. It was a non pvp server. 
---
I liken it to the run from darnassus to iron forge.  The world was expanding before my eyes. Immense and beautiful. Just one of the amazing moments in the game. 
---
I had never experienced anything like it before.
---
Improved GW saves you two seconds per cast but time to kill is the determining factor in setting the pace, not ghost wolf cast time...
---
Is this sub getting more and more neurotic the closer we get to launch? The things you people stress over makes me wonder how TF you function in daily life. Seriously. Relax. Just play what you want. Jesus.
---
Tanking is the superior role
---
LOL! One of my buddy's was a legendary Warrior (actually) in Vanilla. Ever since playing with him I always thought UD Warriors were sick! 
---
Gotta agree with you on the description though haha.
---
You can, with totem twisting.
---
So I guess the answer is no?
---
Yeah, that's why you should vendor or stockpile in the start. After a couple of weeks there will be players at 60 who will want to level up professions. That's when you sell.
---
I can appreciate your passion for era appropriate armor but, I got to be stylin'
---
💯
---
**Region**: NA.
---
**Server**: PvP.
---
**Faction**: Alliance 
---
**Class**: Hunter
---
**Raid availability**: M-F 9pm-12am Central, S-SU 9AM.
---
**Looking for**: Semi hardcore/casual raiding and a group to spam BG's with. I am a dedicated player but I have a family and a job so it will be hard to always be available. I have 2 friends that will play and join but they too are in the Dad mode. Fun group of guys looking to relive a part of the glorious past!
---
**Experience**: 2200 in arena in cata and Mop and warlords. Ran heroic and Mythic raids in Warlords. Left in the last expansion and coming back for a more challenging game.
---
It's completely impossible for a mage to spec viably in pvp and pve, got it.
---
More than likely if you don’t have your own guild you should shoot for OT, MT requires 100% raid attendance and running atuement and pre raid Bis runs every day with your guild outside of raids.
---
Free Points!
---
I expect that it will have been. But that only tells me that the content must be hella easy for people to go unnoticed even when leeching. (obviously not the top end content mind)
---
What's to be confused about? They want \#nochanges because they don't trust Blizzard to change anything without screwing it up, but in an ideal scenario where they could get only good changes, they would want some changes.
---
Thank you, friendo.
---
Human female rogue I think. As I want to try melee, and am only interested in swords, really.
---
honestly the spec looks fine to me. should be just fine. the video card is pushing the minimum spec required but it'l play. you might get some slowdown with high populated areas.
---
Nice, I will start planing tonight! I will aim for finishing before classic launch.
---
That's just conjecture.
---
&gt; who did it with 4 and one of them was a druid
---
I'd love to see this.
---
Could you link it?
---
So not trying to start any argument but warlocks are literally the second highest pve dps in the game starting around phase 3/4. Due to hit gear, correct rotation, talents etc. A paladin can help with 30% reduce threat, which gives warlocks a huge cushion to blow up on the target. Also a lock with engineering and correct aoe choice against mobs is going to do a but load of dps. So I’m a little confused by some of these posts and yours. If you really dive into the class with research and listening to safe and alive you’ll would know!
---
This! This is by far the worst part of vanilla. I really hope after a couple years they come out with new classic content and revamp the whole class balance system. You want to tank as a pally? Cool go for it bro. Want to dps as basically any hybrid class? Great! I am excited to experience vanilla as it was as a timepiece but when everyone has naxx gear and the hype has worn off I really hope they consider an option to port your toon to classic+ and not just rerun the cycle with TBC.
---
Omg I've been looking for this for so long! Thank you!
---
If they truly find it flawed they'd spend their time on retail where skill matters
---
Druids can tank just as well as warriors but they are sub optimal for MT
---
Lack of connecting quests between zones. I'd love there to be those 10-15 quests they added in TBC to make the flow of leveling feel better.
---
Respec cost between PvP and raiding. I'd rather spend 500-1000g once and have it save my spec and action bars.
---
The grindy aspect of rankings. I don't know that there is a good solution to this, as the prestige of ranking up definitely brings something to it, and forcing competitive would alienate solo or small groups.
---
There was probably some cranky old bastard complaining about the invention of "asshole", when "whoreson" worked fine for hundreds of years before that.
---
Tauren
---
Rolling Rogue and Warlock again, but on Horde this time around.
---
Yeah, it moves into a grey area.  Because you could technically pen and paper all the damage of everyone in the raid to track DPS and threat. But really, you can't.  But you can get a recount of your combat log to text and then parse that with a 3rd party application.  So really, having stuff like DPS and threat meters could be done with external programs.

---
&lt;Reign&gt; was founded back in 2014. 
---
For the last 5 years we have been around on various private servers/projects with the same core of members that we will be bringing into Classic.
---
We are looking to recruit more top-motivated players with a like minded philosophy of hardcore gaming along with consistent self and group improvement.
---
Going into Classic our “Core” consists of 
---
85% Vanilla private server players who already “beat the game” several times. 
---
15% consists of top experienced retail players such as multiple Rank 1 arena players and raiders from various top 100 retail guilds. 
---
**Raid times:**
---
Saturdays – 1pm CST (all content cleared this day until past-AQ)
---
Sundays – for 20-mans, PTR and Phase 6 content if a 2nd day is needed (we value efficiency and speed)
---
**Our goals:**
---
• Week 2 Ragnaros
---
• PVP dominance / bracket control
---
• World boss dominance
---
• Server firsts / Top 3 NA
---
• Server’s fastest speed runs / Top 3 NA
---
• Resource control (i.e. Devilsaur)
---
• World PVP dominance
---
**Recruitment status:**
---
Fury warrior: medium 
---
Rogue: medium
---
Mage: low
---
Warlock: low 
---
Priest: **high**
---
Paladin: medium
---
Druid: low 
---
Hunter: medium
---
*Our raid slots are competitive and we are constantly on the lookout for* ***talents.***
---
*Even if your class/role is listed as “low” under recruitment status we strongly encourage you to submit your application if you think you have what it takes to become a part of &lt;Reign&gt;*

This looks absolutely stunning. Any chance you'll do other races? Humans? Lordaeron theme vs Stormwind theme?
---
I like mine medium rare you?
---
Too bad the class balance in retail is absolutely garbage. I mean we used to complain about TBC/WoTLK balance, but retail is another story. They’ve fucked it up to a point where they’ll need to start balance from level 1 and work their way to max level.
---
Depends what you call a subgenre. I think House, Techno, Trance, DnB, and Dubstep are pretty distinct things. Deep House, Liquid Dnb, and Progressive Trance are where I give up.
---
Release sub numbers so everyone can see how dead live is.
---
I think this one is open to anyone with a current sub, but I'm not positive.
---
I googled for screenshots where the elapsed time would show those amounts of hours but I couldn’t find any screens, would love to see some

The first WoW video I watched was of a gnome rogue trolling people or something like that. I'm not sure what happened in the video, but I have some images of it in my head. No idea what video was that as I've never seem it again I think.
---
Haha I lolled. 
---
Yeah it literally just so happened to work out. I was in the process of landing a new job, initial plan was to have July be the last month. Turned out to be August. Then suddenly I figured: I’ll just stop at Employer A, take a two week break and start at Employer B.
---
It might actually be that I’ve got last two weeks of August off as well. Then two weeks of work, then a 4 week trip to Indonesia. Yeh.. stars aligned for this one 😅
---
Horde because I am a man and like women, mage because I’ve played a mage for a very long time, frost initially because of fire resistance, into fire for pve and elemental build for pvp later on.
---
Medium rare is the only right way.
---
🤣
---
It’s a new one this week - we had some issues with the old one.
---
good plan! I enjoy playing more of a support role too, being top dps isn't always everything!
---
Airwave - When things go wrong, add that one :D
---
Rp pve? Gtfo cinderella
---
god bless
---
You're about as viable as any other raid spec, which was my point, mages are not "really good" at pvp and pve with just one spec.
---
I wouldn't agree at all with elemental shaman being the best in the game in group pvp. They suck at dealing with cc and have pretty much 0 cc of their own. And what they can do is easily countered by a totem stomp macro. They are more of a solo pvp class if you ask me.
---
I think you are correct but in a fantasy world where MLG AV was a thing I could see horde winning 40% of the time.

**Incarnation** [A] | NA-PvP | Mon/Tues/Weds | 7-10 pm PST | Hardcore | loot council

&amp;lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community. If you take the time to talk with us you'll see our passion and that we're taking this seriously.
---
Apparently the community disagrees. I really don't like how Minmax culture has taken hold. It takes a beautiful game and boils it down to "we have to win as fast as possible"
---
how do you win in an mmorpg?
---
Yeah, I completely understand that. I just wanted to know what you meant, since I'm going to roll mage and could learn a thing or two.
---
If you are a holy paladin and can throw up the correct buffs, auras, and a good healer raid leaders with suck your dick

**Recruitment** : Fresh Core / Need Heals + DPS @ Launch \[Emphasis NOT LIMITED to: Shamans / Priests / Mage / Rogue / DPS Warrior\]
---
**About Us**: &lt;No Bedtime&gt; is a guild created with the mindset of completing all content WoW Classic has to offer in a competitive time table. The goal in mind for the guild was to harbor all different players from Casual to Hardcore Raiding, to create a mature community that you would want to be a part of and meet new people with similar goals and aspirations. Having a casual player base creates a healthy balance to keep the spirits high and everyone grounded. Ideally the goal is to shoot for top 5-10 in terms of PvE progression on the realm of choice. We will be rolling on a non-streamer realm to avoid the plague of immaturity that many of their followers bring.
---
**Experience** : Personally I've cleared and been a RL for all content until Naxx (AQ 9/9) playing across three different roles. This experience was in the Pserver scene but has provided valuable feedback for progressing forward into Classic. At the same time I was acting as the second in command, where this time I would be acting as GM. Playing on NA ping, and acting as a GM will be a new journey that I'm excited for!
---
**Expectations / Closing Statements** : If you are looking to join, then I expect you know how to conduct yourself among other humans with a sense of morality and maturity. We are looking for people who are enjoyable to be around but who also have a goal they would want to achieve. There are different ranks among the guild of which you can find your fit intermittently for the time being or a more cemented spot in the Raiding Roster.
---
If you are interested in joining then you contact me via Discord and/or fill out a guild application or catch me in game; if you are interested in being a pivotal part of our success and joining the officiating ranks of (Class Leader / Council Member) also message me via Discord.

I think it will come out with character creation or a few days before.
---
The thing with priests in wow is that each race that can be a priest has a unique religion which is why they get racials. I view troll priests more as witch doctors rather than priests that worship the light. Same with night elves, they worship elune and their racials reflect that as well.
---
The new insult will be “Yeah scrub I got a 120 who’s 9/9M on Mal’ganis wut”

Aka they stopped 6 years or so ago and never returned. Even in BFA there were only several hundred thousand individuals parsing in warcraftlogs. That number dropped hard week by week once people realized how shallow it was.

Are you trying to tell me that ' some people seem to think the only way to enjoy Classic is by rushing, beating the crowd, playing several hours every day. ' this isn't true? Because I've 100% seen people who are like this. And I don't mean on reddit, I mean some of my friends are like this and some people I've played with are like this. And it's not native to this game either, its across all games. 
---
We aren't saying it's a bad thing, we are just saying that you don't have to rush. Same way as you don't have to take it slow. Play at your own pace is their original message I believe and I agree.

---
Semi-Hardcore Gaming Group
---
&lt;Hive&gt; is a newly formed guild specifically for Classic WoW. We are recruiting members that want to experience the most they can in Classic WoW. We are looking for like minded individuals to build a great community of all walks of players.  We will be clearing raid content and are filling spots for our primary raid group, so get in while you can.
---
About Us:
---
&lt;Hive&gt; is a core group of 10-15 people that have been gaming with each other over the last 10+ years. We range in age from 22-35 and some of us are family and IRL friends. We have both male and female players and are open to any “mature” gamer joining our ranks. I am the GM and have played WoW since the beginning and have played off and on every expansion. Some of our core have played Vanilla but most come from different iterations of the game. We don’t care if you have played or not, we will teach you what you need to know as long as your willing to learn and improve.
---
What we expect from you:
---
Willingness to learn and improve. Be on time to raids and come prepared. Help other guild mates when you have the opportunity. Be mature. Provide feedback when it is warranted.
---
Raiding and Loot:
---
We will be raiding Thursday &amp; Saturday 9PM-1AM US Central time. We will be utilizing Loot Council for raid loot.
---
Extra Opportunities:
---
Since we are a freshly formed guild for Classic, we still have some spots open for class officers/leaders. If interested, you must be knowledgeable about your class and willing to direct others of the same class when necessary.
---

If you're interested in joining or chatting with our current members to see if we might be a good fit, stop by our Discord: https://discord.gg/jxu2xYW

PM me on reddit if you have questions.
---
That level of decay will take a LONG time. Most people that get R14 will likely still PvP, or will be obligated to do so as part of the group that helps them reach that rank.
---
It makes sense that you don't have 90 High Warlords. The ranks are dedicated to the Current tier you are in, Obama and Bush aren't the Commanders-in-Chief along with Trump.
---
I hope we get enough notice for the streamers to actually choose a server... it would be awful if any of them to be up in the air by the time name reserves are out :/
---
lmao no  
---
if classic style mmos were that popular there would be some like it

That’s the content with no mechanics and essentially no healing or dps requirements, it’s just there so everyone can do the raid and not complain about “it’s too hard.” 
---
Anything that is actual content in the game, people will expect you to know what you are doing.
---
It goes two ways, there’s also people calling others out on playing BFA.
---
It’s as retarded as most discussions in gaming, like CoD vs Battlefield.
---
Inventing a new word as an alternative isn't the same thing as twisting an existing one to fit a new purpose. Still, god bless that cranky old bastard for trying.
---
Raid consumables. I think they were out of control in classic. It was just too much. The game was already super time consuming. I shouldn't need to spend thousands of gold just to raid Naxx. It was fucking ridiculous frankly.
---
I would be more insulted if someone accused me of having the character you just described
---
1. Boe drops have the same value to every player (market value). Bop drops have large time value to certain players, miniscule gold value to others. It's worth ignoring the tiny gold value of bops so that when the drop you're interested in comes along they do the same. 
---
2. Epic boe's are incredibly slanted towards warriors; seriously go look at the list. Do you think it's fair that your the one warrior in your group gets 8/10 expensive boe's?
---
A reduction is threat output will lower the threat-ceiling.
---
Make you better, stronger, faster?

It hasn’t been asked enough on this sub yet. We are at 567,824/570,000 posts. Only a few thousand more to go!

What happened and is happening would be fair observations if you believe that the two are and will be one in the same.
---
Of course there will be subtle differences in terms of how the bg (and likely the entirety of the game) operates when compared to memories or private server experiences, but this are some of the exact reason that support the chances of the meta being worked on.
---
What I'm getting at is the fact that peoples understanding of how things operated/operate/will operate is always (or at least it should be) open for discussion and potential improvement.
---
That being said, I'm of a firm belief that the people will indeed find a way to adapt to the *current* meta in a way that helps to shift the paradigm away from that which you described.
---
Finally, to go back to retail AV, your point is moot in the context of classic...Something that has been revised and altered to the extent that it has been (not to mention the rest of the entire game) is not representative... I'm sorry but it's just not.
---
&gt;Yeah here on the classic wow subreddit
---
Its the literally first comment in the chain man...
---
But I mean do you like Tool?
---
Hunter or shaman here. Still undecided 🤔
---
Troll mage. Best racial (you really won’t need 3x fear removals for pvp) in berserking. Frost for the first raids and initial pvp, and then respec into fire for pve and elemental build (or maybe stay frost, we’ll see) for pvp.
---
It certainly helps, but the lack of downtime because you can heal is the top reason. Cat damage is fairly good while leveling and doesn't rely on getting new weapons.
---
As someone who never reached level 60 in Vanilla, what sorts of methods are available to farm 100g a week? I'm not even sure how much money that truly was anymore. Felt like a lot to level 43 me getting his first mount only thanks to help from generous guildmates.
---
And my point is you’re wrong lol 200k is a low number of players to assume are going to play
---
Yeah this is mine. I actually still regularly quote this.
---
"ready normal people?"
---
"so grab your dick and double click for porn porn POOORN"
---
But what if I am a pest controller by trade :/
---
:insert generic meme:
---
Oh no, everything in the brackets is one condition. So [x, y] means that both parts, x and y, need to be true for that condition to pass. If you have [x, y] [z] that is two separate conditions: if x *and* y is true, or else if z is true. The macro reads left to right, so it will always check [x, y] first, then if that is false it will check [z].
---
So in the mouseover case: [@mouseover, harm]
---
First bracket asks 'do you have a mouse over target' *and* 'is your target an enemy'. If both of those things are true, it passes and uses your mouseover target for the spell. If your mouseover target is friendly, then harm does not pass and the spell doesn't trigger. If you select an enemy but aren't moused over an enemy, then @mouseover doesn't pass and the spell still doesn't trigger.
---
If you want the spell to trigger even if you don't have a mouseover target, you need: [@mouseover, harm] [harm]
---
It reads 'cast a spell at the mouseover target if it exists *and* is hostile' or else 'cast a spell if the target is hostile'.
---
You can also use:
---
[@mouseover,harm] []
---
The empty brackets means "always true". It reads 'cast a spell at the mouseover target if it exists *and* is hostile' or else 'cast a spell'. A spell that only affects enemies (like Intimidating Shout) will still fizzle and give a warning if you target an ally, of course.
---
You could hypothetically just use:
---
[@mouseover] []
---
It just checks if you have any mouseover target first, or else casts the spell normally. This runs the risk of accidentally mousing over an ally (which would target them and prevent a spell like Intimidating Shout from casting) despite having a hostile target selected.
---
At 60 yes I believe there is an extensive quest. But at 40 they learn to summon the mount like any other spell.
---
I'm sorry that asking for player counts to be released to the community, for a game the community literally forced to happen, is being "an entitled bitch".
---
And why do you have to be so hostile to anyone asking for anything? If nothing else, it would be at least interesting on a "huh, how about that" level to see the data.
---
Since it hasn't been mentioned, drop rates (and since its directly related, spawn timers).
---
Oh you need boar meat to make billy his pie? Sorry, the farmers here specialize in breeding the rare veggie breed of boars. Combine that with multiple minute respawn timers and 50 people farming the same mobs... Welcome to classic!
---
You finally got to the next zone, congrats! I bet you wished you saved the boar snouts and intestines, crunchy spider legs and whatever else you probably vendored.
---
Why not?
---
I mean "asshole" literally does mean the anus betwixt one's buttcheeks, and "dickhead" meaning the crown of one's cock. When you call someone those terms, you are comparing them to those things. Likewise, when you call someone toxic, you're comparing them to the toxic waste that's excreted after the Green Goblin eats a particularly spicy burrito. Most insults are non-literal references to other things.
---
This, hopefully, is the abstract linguistic commentary that you come to the wow classic subreddit for
---
Why Wednesday specifically?
---
I hope you are right!
---
Honor system
---
Even better! Thanks!
---
I would say a lot of that could go to a guild bank, which is one of the things I wish they had.
---
The lack of guild bank promotes account sharing, and makes it mush harder to distribute less consequential items.
---
It's impossible for somebody to spec in between. You must absolutely spec deep pvp or deep pve
---
the practice binge game one got me laughing. This is absolutely insane and you deserve the neckbeard title
---
I'm a generic person what can I say
---
Can confirm, you looked like a jerk.
---
I had a lot of fun in vanilla with my frost mage, very flexible, a huge toolkit for kiting, and great fun in duels. I also loved dungeoning with him, a good frost mage can sheep 1 mob and kite a different mob while the group takes down hard mobs. I just loved turning around a bad fight. There were many a time I could 2v1 in pvp just due to the amazing kiting kit. My very very first char was a lock, my experience was very bad, I think with what I know now I could have a lot of fun with a lock in a demo or ruin build, if I have extra time with classic I will roll one again to see.
---
I rolled a shadow priest in 29 for twinking was fun but requires more emphasis on positioning and running away while dealing damage(not kiting like a mage). However I just loved to watch a good disc priest duel anyone outside org and just outlast them to death, its glorious to watch. I will be rolling another priest for that reason.
---
With all this said the most fun ive had is with a twink shammy. Playstyle is so fun, and they have a totem to counter anything, plus i like the roll play of the voodoo spiritual shaman mon! This will be my first roll in classic. 
---
Good luck sir, hit me up if you have mage gameplay questions.
---
It helps to realize that most gamers' toxicity is simply ignorance.  They say disparaging things because they either find it funny or simply don't know any better; not because they actually hold some deep-seated hatred in their heart,  Just look at the stereotypical CoD gamer "Lol I'mma fuck your mom hur hur."  Most of the time it's just them talking shit or trying to trigger you.
---
Still a good idea to have thick skin and not take things too seriously.  Also your lifestyle is no one's business but yours, and honestly it's probably a good idea to not divulge too much personal information until you get to know people.
---
Melee leeway gonna make him able to reach you tho
---
Polite scare beast every druid or shaman in animal form? (Does scare beast put you into combat or alert bouncers in vanilla?)
---
Way worse? 
---
Can I have what you were smoking?
---
Yes, bleeding-edge min/max hard core guilds might not take a mage t sunwell, but *most* guilds would, they'd just be a little than ideal. But Sunwell mage compared to bringing a Ret Pally or Balance Druid to Naxx? not even close.
---
TBC wasn't perfect, but it was LEAGUES better than Vanilla in class balance.
---
I don’t want classic+. There was an interview where they said they would consider tbc and wrath.
---
Done, thank you!
---
I’m assuming it will be posted somewhere online. If not through Blizzard then through a third party site. I think the safest bet for launch is finding a server name that isn’t faction related. A server named “Thrall” will clearly be horde dominated, etc
---
It's not about validating anyones choice to play the game. It can actually be a useful indicator of whether this sort of effort by a community is worth it. And it's at the least an interesting number to look at. How many people want to play a 14 year old game that for so long people said no one wants to play?
---
Aw, thats terrible!
---
Maybe through a third party website, but as far as I’m aware there has never been an official way to see this info.
---
I remember when we found a way to essentially queue as a guild.
---
We had about 25 guys in full raid gear, organized in vent.  Never steamrolled that shit so quick
---
Human Rogues are amazing!
---
"Race exclusive abilities since different races have variations in their faith"
---
If this is the actual reason there are different race specific priest spells, I learned something today.
---
Many you seem to fit right into our guild time slots you seem like a perfect fit for our guild. If you want, I can send you some more details on our guild
---
Notice the "in my opinion" part of that.  I'm not saying it's fact, I'm basing this on my opinion.  Just as you are basing your statements on your opinion. Sounds like the pot calling the kettle black here.
---
At this point, we're at an "agree to disagree" because we're not going to convince otherwise.  I'll be running groups as a tank.  Rules will be all BoE are need.  Only exception will be 1st orb to MT, possibly 2nd to healer if there was a difficulty finding a healer, remainder are random'd off in living strath runs.  
---
You can run your groups with your own rules.  Isn't it amazing that people with different opinions can run groups how they want in a game like WoW: Classic, isn't it?
---
Imagine saying this to jahmilli
---
It saved me from getting ganked quite a few times in STV.
---
In my experience, not a single guild I've ever been in or have associated with, has been anti-anything or unfriendly toward any individual or group of people (except scoliosis/halitosis ridden horde scum or dirty alliance dogs, depending on your respective faction.)
---
So no, I don't feel the need to use the filter. It feels artificial and unneeded to me. Most people, at the least, keep themselves to themselves, don't care, whatever. Most people aren't going to kick someone out of a guild because they're a guy who said "I'm going to see a movie with my boyfriend, I'm going to be late for the raid."
---
Those that do are few and far between, to the point that I still have yet to *personally* experience one (on official servers, anyway.)
---
**\[NA PVP Horde\]** LF Sham/Priest/Warr/Rogue/Druid to join our melee cleave dungeon leveling groups for Classic launch. Must put in some practice before launch. We have groups doing both hardcore and semi-hardcore hours. DM me on Discord for more info: Morph#4209
---
I can’t believe I’d forgotten about this video. So good.
---
Thanks for this. MAU would be interesting for Classic alone, but I want it to not include unpaying users etc. Just tell me how many people played classic this week/month for a few months. So I can see whether there was genuine interest like we have claimed all along or not. It would be the right thing for Blizz to release anyway after denying this interest existing for so long.
---
Tauren Druid.  Because only Taurens can be Druids on Horde.
---
I wish I had a more in depth answer.
---
can i be really boring and ask you explain your 6-6 situation? i dont get how that works and im curious?
---
u/viridz so videos like this are fine but mine wasn't? lol you're a joke bud
---
What were the Naxx currency items?
---
I hope there are server forums. I remember looking at everything in the server forum to find out who was doing what. Lots of shit talking cross faction. I loved it.
---
I don’t want any changes either but  they should add death knights
---
Arms isn't a class either. Only some warriors can do it. Same with priests.
---
# &lt;Doggo Noir&gt;US-East PvP | Alliance | Semi-Hardcore | Boosted Discord Server
---
We are a Casual-hardcore raiding guild. What does that mean? Well, the casual being we do not intend to set world first or expect you to be 60 in 2 weeks we will be taking our time and hope to be 60 in about 6 weeks. This also means that if you happen to miss a raid you won’t receive a /gkick. And the hardcore? Well, the hardcore bit means we will be taking raids seriously and will be expecting people to do what is demanded of their class/role and to come prepared with consumables and knowledge of raid fights.
---
Other than that, the guild in its current state is very relaxed. Our members range from 29-35 and all have their shit together irl. Our application process involves a brief chat just to make sure you will mesh well with us. Nothing too serious though. Please look over the rest of our details to see if &lt;Doggo Noir&gt; fits well with you and how you hope to play classic. 
---
**Schedule:**
---
Raids: *Tuesday/Thursday 7pm - 11pm EST*
---
We plan on progressing through end game content at a steady pace that makes sense to our Guilds members. We do plan on reaching and clearing Naxx when that content is available. 
---
**Loot system**
---
*Loot Reservation.*
---
We believe in rewarding members for showing up and performing well during raids but found several issues with the loot council and DKP system. This is a straightforward system that guarantees loot for raiders. There is no bidding, no luck, no council. You put what items you want on a list before we enter the raid and if it drops, it’s yours, it’s as simple as that.
---
**How to join:**   
---
Please take 5 minutes to fill out this application, jump in our discord and someone will get back to you within the day!  
---

I'd be more than okay with that if it means I don't have to wait until the last second to find my server and name.
---
Oh gods I remember those battle's! The puny Alliance would grind their numbers down on our weapons and shields until they ran out of soldiers and we would win by default.
---
Except they didn't. Subs ticked up slightly during Wrath but it was much closer to 2 years of stagnation than to sub gains like those from Vanilla and TBC.
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.

Ever single person I've ever known to play wow before is coming back to play classic.

That’s huge it changes everything xD
---
The two biggest streamers who actually attract followers, asmongold and sodapoppin, have both said they will hide the server they choose for as long as thats possible. Soda has said he may not stream 1-60 at all, in order level quietly and not create problems on the server. Asmon has stated recently that he is leaning towards a pve server since he knows he will get ganked 24/7 on a pvp server and he mostly only cares about pve content anyway.
---
I see what you did there! :P
---
Oh thanks I’ll post it there too good thinking
---
They are the same size actually. It can be a little odd because since Tauren are so big and bearform is much smaller there is an odd shrinking mechanic that happens whenever a Tauren changes forms. This happens with every form, even shaman ghost wolf.
---

---
In general, Horde is the underdog faction in Classic. But certain servers might still favor Horde.
---
One could say the word 'toxic' is cancerous.
---
Everyone is going to disagree on this. Simplest answer is it plays out how the group agrees it should play out prior to the drop.
---
Yeah was planning to put it on one of my mouse thumb buttons. Thanks!
---
That is fun to me
---
Good, and then delete it here.
---
It is a class skill.
---
I don't really care if it is popular by some definition, but having the data would at the least be something interesting. For those that care, we can know whether certain arguments had merit or not. For those that don't; first, nothing changes; second, they might benefit from increased openness and communication between Blizzard and the community, which might even lead to increased trust in the future. That can only be a good thing for the health of the game.
---
I think most people would be on board with guild banks at this point.
---
Back in the day we would account share, and sure there were incidents, but I'd be a lot less trusting nowadays.  Sure you can get around it by having personal bank alts.  But any semi-large guild needs a central place to store important items for the guild without having to rely on a person being online to access them.
---
I assume you're building two computers? However I'm confused at the different parts selection. Looks like one is going to be a beefy computer, and another is like a entry level gaming computer, just because theirs a 750w psu, then a 550w psu. A radeon 5700, and then a rx570?
---
&lt;Eternal&gt; NA HORDE PVP - Loot Council - Hardcore

There will also be a lot of people from retail, and people coming back from other MMOs.
---
I think the implication that any significant portion of classic players will be completely new mmorpg players is pretty daft tbqhf.
---
Nah mods seem to be good with it, but thanks for you input
---
Smite, heals, fade, pw shield, fort, inner fire, holy fire, mind blast, pw pain, mind flay, resurrect rank 1 only, psychic scream rank 1 only, abolish disease, dispel magic. Optional MC/mana burn on PvP servers.
---
Ignore everything else until you at least have ur mount lvl 40+
---
Actually paid full price for Windows
---
For now I think it will be a mix of the initial version plus  reinforcements from retail.

Watercool a ryzen 3? Lmao
---
So warris didn‘t get any interesting perks but all the top stats instead. Interesting
---
&gt;  Just as you are basing your statements on your opinion. 
---
No I'm not. It's not opinion that the system was designed with greed for cash and need for use.  
---
It's literally the only consistent way you can ever use it.
---
I dont even think it saves time I think it wastes time
---
I can do that. I mean it's literally like $40-50. I just want this information shared with the community to increase openness with the community and start to build trust between Blizz and the community.
---
Naxx Bucks

Even if for some reason I end up playing a different class or switching factions I'll still recreate my OG
---
Valuable BoE items = everybody needs.
---
if he's right, then there should be a mass exodus of people who downrank heals  switching to alternate(take turns) healing instead... right?
---
I'll be here waiting. 
---
!remind me in 2 months
---
Ugh I didn’t realize things had changed. I knew about Soda wanting to play off-stream, but Asmond said he wants to hide it? Last I heard they wanted to do a streamer server since streamers interacting was getting so many views
---
Might = Right
---
Edit is your friend in this instance because you mean AV not classic and even still id rather play a wow version I actually enjoy rather than log in and for many actually get a max level character to even que for it. Its a big miss from blizzard once again but credit where its due they are at least releasing classic when they said they wanted to.
---
The word toxic reminds us of the social justice warrior types who coined (the current usage for) the term. That's why we don't like that word.
---
If you're gonna equip it, roll need.
---
If you're gonna sell it, roll greed.
---
Any other choice is your selfish ego trying to get more for itself.
---
Holy disc priest is pretty much the exact same build for pvp and pve. Not sure what lots of these other guys are thinking, posting pvp build then saying they kinda work for pve (like ele sham).
---
**Semi-Hardcore Raiding. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.**  
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before reset, thus the name. :) I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
Closed: Druid
---
Server TBD
---
🔷 **Discord** at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a) 🔷
---
I would expect that after server names are released, you will start seeing popular guilds announce where they will be going. Then I expect someone to do some analysis on what servers seem to be dominated by what, and you can choose a server that looks to be balanced.
---
They took those out in the 1.12 version of AV. The version of AV that we were playing on Nostalrius was the pre-nerf version, which won't be available in Classic.
---
Mage, lock and priest can roll need if the item is an upgrade for them. If not, they roll greed.
---
Hunter and warrior will roll greed. If they roll need, they are ninjaing.

---
Asmon said he wants that but its been impossible to coordinate. But again, he is heavily leaning towards a pve server, whereas soda wants to roll pvp. But yes, Asmon has indicated that he wont reveal his server choice.
---
Doesnt look like thats the case after checking his (short) comment history.
---
You'll make quite a bit of gold leveling and questing
---
Lucky AH and some extra saving, you'll be fine
---
I know i want to play shaman. Period. Unfortunately all of my friends are going alliance...
---
roll on same server? you bet your sweet ass i'm ganking them.
---
I dont think every streamer will be on 1 server. I think every server will be a streamer server bc there will only be a few servers
---
Im a cow myself, I would rather have an activated ability than rely on a passive.
---
&gt; I'd like to see these posts or comments, I only really see what Op is refering to on this sub.   
---
&gt;Yeah here on the classic wow subreddit i found this really ridiculous rule that says you have to play slow and ease into the leveling or else you won't have fun and you WILL burn out.  
---
&gt;Rly strange to me gotta say
---
That last line on the original comment is someone who won't be playing slow and thinks it's 'strange' for someone to do so. 
---
There's an answer to your question. Staring you right in the face. Happy now? 
---
Also calling someone's comment disingenuous, just because you disagree with it is a bit egotistical.
---
I  was in the same situation as you but for me it came down to tier sets and how much I enjoy the class so I finally nailed down Holy Paladin then Restoration Druid to start with and then i'll decide after gearing those two.
---
&gt;Oh, and you can swim in lava.
---
Sounds like a good time.
---
*Forbidden* Server players have a tendency to think youll just deal with it as it happens, if they ninja and you cant handle the extra, its somehow YOU that are bad.... Anyway;  
---
You can pull pretty aggresively, and then step back when youve reached the limit of what you can handle. DPS will be drawn to the big bunch of mobs, not get bored, and wander off to pre-position, loot an herb or whatever like you sometimes see them do if there isnt alot going on. [Something like this](https://youtu.be/AVILovxzCnw?t=349) pull by Preach in beta is too good for the DPS not to give it their all.  
---
Other than that, talk to your group. If you have a plan, go "Stay, Ill pull next 2 mobs back" and so on. People will listen if you seem like you know what youre doing.
---
People in mc gear will own people in pre raid BiS. People in blue PvP set compete fine until people are full on bwl+ geared. 
---
Alts in vanilla are generally that alts, and their gear level won't be close to your main unless your main is never that geared to begin with.
---
But some classes do grind better than others so having a mage farming alt who isn't in purple gear is still viable
---
I am changing my race to troll, for pve raiding.  I will still play a hunter.  At least I know what to do this time.
---
Everyone should need. Anyone that would actually equip it rather than sell it doesn't deserve the item. Something that you will replace fairly easily isn't worth losing a large portion of an epic mount for.
---
I joined a guild and they were like: You're a druid, also we're on horde. So that made it all pretty straight forward from that point on :).
---
I think the point  he’s making is that you’re being  needlessly specific. There is no umbrella term for classes/race+class combo so in this situation  calling it a class is a reasonable jump. It is the definition of semantic detail
---
Yes, it doesn't sound like this is a permanent addition but rather just for the event.
---
That’s pretty cool so these guys want arena in vanilla with no added bonuses to the game , just the flat out arena experience and no loot or otherwise added mechanic to the game
---
Economic build? Cheapest crap you can find?
---
Tuf mobo, crap video card? Come on man.
---
I think the PVP mounts only cost 30 marks from each battleground.
---
You may need to be a certain rank to access the vendor though, I can't remember.
---
Ehh, I'd argue that if two groups of people constantly call each other the same thing (for example, Twitch and /r/classicwow), that word is pretty unnecessary as the two kinda cancel each other out. Just my take, and not an unpopular one.
---
I’ve been watching YouTube videos like crazy. It is kinda wild knowing this game is going to release and it’s going to be such a drastic transition

I think strictly playing with friends and not relying on the fact that you can play with anyone on the server is not great.
---
Everyone will have different things they want to do, different times they want to play and you will end up angry at each other.
---
I would say play w.e you want and level solo.(can add a few dungeons with friends if you're similar level) When you're all at 60 you can truly start playing as a team.
---
Yeah, the raid sets locking Warriors into tanking, and hybrids into healing etc. really wasn't good. I also don't like the token system of later expansions, it doesn't feel good to get "tokens" to drop from bosses, then you go to some random vendor and just buy the godlike gear he happens to be selling.
---
Now, if Tier sets dropped the way they do now, but Blacksmiths had a way to use some materials to essentially change the set bonuses/stats to fit different specs for people, I think that would have been a cool way to make Blacksmithing a more desirable profession. As it stands, I'm planning on being a Blacksmith, but it just seems like the majority of the gear you can make is useless, outside of like Titan Leggings, Nightfall, and a couple other niche things.
---
Time to start process of Alliance dominate Thrall server.
---
30 marks sounds like nothing!?

It takes a long time, yes. Roughly 4 months to decay from R14 to R2. But it also takes a long time and insane amount of efforts to get to R14. The fact that your character is then forced to run around with whatever your current rank is, is just bullshit. 
---
Pretty wack RL comparison, and not the best at that. Former Presidents, Vice Presidents, Senators, Governors etc. are commonly still referred to by their former highest titles. Goes for retired generals too, see for example Petraeus. 
---
They of course are no longer in those positions, but I'm not saying your standing shouldn't decay. I'm saying your character shouldn't lose the title next to their name.
---
nah, doesn't work like that  
---
its a buy to play, pay to play game with mtx  
---
why do all that when most of the games today are just f2p + mtx?  
---
it wasnt the same back in 2009
---
Since its releasing with the same specs required as in 2004 or close to this is mad overkill but fair play.
---
true enough but you will only be able to disenchant up to a certain level anyways, right?

---
Post TBC they could range from 20 mins to 3 hours depending on team balance. Not the 3 days horseshit
---
I think I'm going with priest as my main, due to, as you said, wanting to get easier invites as a casual, and because I like healing classes and Priest is the best healer overall. I played a lot of Druid in vanilla.
---
I think I'll make a Night Elf Hunter alt, because hunter with Shadowmeld, Track Humanoids, and cat pet is a great experience for world PvP. It's not inconceivable that this could become my main.
---
The thing is, I have some very good memories of leveling in the Barrens, so I want to make a Tauren Shaman on another server. I guess I'll see which faction I get more immersed in this time around, and spend more time with that one. The other can be a backup in case I get stuck on a server where my faction loses all the BG's.
---
You're an alliance druid... im going to be so toxic towards you in Wpvp you're gonna want to reroll.
---
&gt;  is that you’re being needlessly specific. 
---
Well the thing is, someone else doesn't decide how specific I need to be. I decide how specific I am.
---
If you ignore what I specified, and I point that out. I'm not to blame.
---
Being able to save a second spec but still cost gold to respec. Saves some time and tedium
---
I think classic is a lot more about how you get to 60 than people realize. Yes, you can rush to 60 and just play the raid content, but there is so much quality along the way. I’m picking a class that lets me have fun along the way. Every class can be useful in raids (maybe with rerolling talents)
---
My Cat could wield that mace, i could tape it to one of her front paws.....  hmmmm...
---
The first WoW video I remember watching was of a paladin fucking KILLING it in pvp against horde in Blackrock Mountains.  My buddy was trying to convince me to roll a paladin and apparently this absolute unit of a paladin was the best.  Any ideas on who this might have been?
---
I was expecting him to take his own life while visiting her grave after defeating Redsword.
---
&gt;vendor the leather
---
Wait actually? Would it not be better to visit the AH on a bank alt and yeet that shit on there?
---
I believe I found the table you were talking about. In there it breaks it down for you. Assuming you have Edgemaster gloves, and Human racials as bonuses, you would need 6% hit.
---
I agree, as long as it's not the gold farmer bots out there farming it. I remember seeing way too many of those back in the day, and I'm hoping it won't be like that again.
---
How many times will this be posted for karma?
---
I came
---
You can win pretty much any match up, lots depends on how good a players skill is as well of course. But what do you think would make sp lock struggle? Any composition I come up only has disadvantages.
---
I was a hunter and usually always top 3 dps in MC.
---
My biggest hate aspect from pservers is the horde/alliance players who are maxed or 10+ levels over you who gank and sit ontop of you for hours.
---
holy shit
---
right in the feels
---
I would agree if totems weren't so easy to counter. Elemental shamans never made me worry in pvp on my dearf hunter. Then again I had aspect of the wild and a single macro I could spam to make a huge part of their toolkit useless.
---
New computer for 2004 game?
---
i love blogposters
---
Yeah. They really fucked up giving us 1.12. None of the really cool early stuff, (long AV for example), and all the awful late stuff, (warriors super op).
---
Don't forget no extra gold for completed quests at max level(the XP is converted into bonus gold). I'm pretty sure they added that with BC. It was a huge gold boost to get your epic flying mount if I remember correctly.
---
If you roll hunter izi loot. I think more instances are closer to Ali as well.
---
Follow your heart.
---
2nd spec would be nice too!
---
I’m actually really worried at the amount of times respecs will be needed. I’m pretty sure the cost of them will eventually start to decline right?
---
Dont play this game.
---
Muppets are to reddit as erm... muppets are to reddit.
---
What class fantasy did TBC strip? Actually while I'm on the subject TBC's gameplay was even *less* homogenous than vanilla's was - resto druids went from spamming healing touch to tree based healing over time, shadow priests got a unique niche as a mana battery and demonology finally got a demon that you could focus your identity around.
---
&gt; hit cap is 5% base. If a player has defense rating &gt; 300 it will give 0.04% increased chance to be missed per point.  
---
&gt;Weapon skill gives you 0.04% increase crit chance per point in pvp, as well as 0.04% less chance to be dodged. It does not increase your chance to hit in pvp unless the player has over 300 defense.  
---
&gt;Further, weapon skill gives .2% hit chance when the delta is &gt; 10. Weapon skill gives you .1% when the delta is &lt; = 10.  
---
&gt;IIRC, the attack table rolls from 1-10000 so "hit rating only functions in whole values" seems to be incorrect.
---
 "Each point of Defense over the attacker's Attack skill adds 0.04% Dodge against players and 0.1% against mobs; on the other hand, each point of Defense below the attacker's Attack skill cuts Dodge by 0.04% against players and 0.1% against mobs."
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
I agree with the removal of punishment for breaks
---
You get three marks per win, so it's only 10 wins for each BG.  Not really as bad as it sounds.
---
Still think you need rank 11 for it to be available for purchase.  Either way, it's going to be a bit of work.  For someone who doesn't want to move starting zones, or do cloth turn-ins, the PVP option might be more attractive.  It's good to have options.
---
How certain classes were very much pidgeonholed into X or Y spec if the player wanted to raid - so I guess you could say Blizz's lack of experience with MMO class balance.
---
On the topic of dueling, once someone got mad at me for healing in a duel.
---
If blizz does not give us this Version:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xQj2fbUGaDE
---
they would pretty much fuck up one of the major Classic experiences!
---
Neither are you.
---
If I as a rogue have a thrash blade, and a krul blade drops and I win it, I'm selling it.
---
If any other class purple boe drops, I'm stating I'm rolling need and selling it (or giving it to my guild bank).
---
We all have needs. Gold enables mine, stats enable theirs. Rolling need
---
When i was raiding long time ago in far far away land of vanilla on some fights we took turns to regen some mana (~20-30%) or when time allowed cast wand 2-3 times (or non stop, minus avoiding dmg zones) with judgement of wisdom (59mana/wand swing). I think both will be used at p3 onwards.
---
I rolled NE druid in the first week. It was brutal and I was broke (too many spells to upgrade). It was miserable trying to level.
---
So after a week, I gave up and rerolled priest. That first week of druid leveling tainted me for years on druids.
---
We dont want armory? I started in wotlk and lack perspective
---
Judging by the minimum specs they released, that coffee maker in the background is probably fast enough to run classic.
---
If you want 3 v 3 you go out into the world and find it :D
---
I died recently while trying out BFA! I was steamrolling through the mobs at level 110-112, but suddenly I hit 113, and the mobs (who scale in level with you) suddenly started actually doing damage to me, and taking longer to kill! God, scaling mobs is such dumb design.
---
ud shadow priest. i need challenge back in vanilla i was T2 Hunter
---
&gt;Probably just copy and paste from classic wow client.
---
yeah that's not how any of this works. but k
---
Gives ya that perfect pink center without the chance of death. You feel risky without actually risking it for the biscuit.
---
And everyone EXCEPT for bleeding edge guilds might bring one ret pally or a boomkin.
---
Will it be optimal? No, but neither is bringing a mage over a warlock in most TBC content for anything OTHER than Ai and table.
---
People like to circle jerk the fuck out of TBC class balance- but the world you’re looking for isn’t balance, and it’s not about classes- the word is breadth and it applies to specs.
---
More specs were useful in TBC because they were homogenized. Don’t have AoE damage? Here have the most broken AoE spell in the game. Don’t have mana regen? Here have an insane amount baked into all damage you deal. No way to interrupt ranged attacks as a melee? Here’s a ranged interrupt that also slows (???).
---
That attempt to bring everything up to par for INSTANCED CONTENT is what killed the world because it signaled that the chief and ONLY concern of blizzard was balancing around that content- the world be damned.
---
The biggest thing for me is NO PHASING AND CROSS REALM.  That absolutely RUINED WoW for me and the sense of community and social responsibility.  Fuck that.  The magic of WoW was making friends, while leveling, only to continuously run into them throughout the 1-60 experience... sharing moments together...waving to eachother in passing....asking if they are on the same group quests as you.... What has Blizzard done to ma boy!?
---
Nobody *needs* a prot warrior to do a dungeon anymore, so this point falls flat. A good tank will still be a good tank regardless of spec.
---
Are you getting at players might not be a good tank so they lose identity or that some classes tank specs can’t tank so they are not a tank?  
---
If a player can perform the same function just as good, dual spec only helps the community.  It also allows more to branch out into other play styles.  There are drawbacks, such as not having to roll other characters, lowering the amount of shards on the market from disenchanting extra items that are instead picked up and just not following the classic gameplay.  
---
Performing the intended role does showcase class and role identity though.
---
The only thing I can think of, and maybe you have one hidden in there, but a gatherer addon, to show mining and herbing nodes.
---
Yeah but I feel that we got so excited for that because we were so young and had no responsibilities. There's still amazing stuff that we get to do but in the back of our minds we know once we are done that it's back to adulthood.
---
The 15 year old graphics.  I’m still hoping for graphics/model toggle in a future update.
---
My asshole is always toxic, especially after tacos.
---
This should be available with the vanilla gameplay...
---
During AQ progression I would have my hearth set to Cenarion Hold. Naxx I would go back to Menethil.
---
depending on what you're doing. i have played druid since 2005 and played private servers (mostly druid) since cata release. this is my experience:
---
Flagcarry in WSG: [use this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMLoZVxfoeq0o). you will need the 4 piece pvp set bonus (3pc if u got the epic set). your trinkets and offhands will always be gadgets for movement and survival. the rest of you gear will be healing gear with the stat prio healing power &gt; stamina &gt; intellect. 
---
Pure Feral PvP: [use this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxgMscbdtV). this spec is the hardest to itemize in pvp. you will need the 4 pieces pvp set bonus again, because since you dont have slows the extra movementspeed is a must have (45% with talents + setbonus in catform). so you need atleast rank8. you will have to itemize with hybridgear (preferably every slot) to cope with the  issues a feral has. those issues are: mana pool, spell damage (moonfire for finishing off people), health pool (hybrid items have less stamina). you will have to use some 2h weapon since there are no 1h weapons worth using until phase 4 thus making it hard to use offhand gadgets (30sec cd on equip). later you should try to get the emerald dragon mace or the aq20 quest mace. those are the easiest to get feral weapons that will last you forever. 
---
[example itemization](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12dca6880be4965f706a27dd51d64e927d004e0879979e7d22bb4e79460b56c95f1ade1f0a564f68afe803264286742587ef643e61f72a0ca77b7bbe6c2fd12912c456185814b0e627f914471046e3bebf52c99f91e549a7f9620a1821c750c9f531fc10c5641e349fa61d7d03ad1209ce78158b27988f7030fb642e5f7a7dc6b0c882575e01041252b0bcc46e1e3038d0c77a0dfeefda7a9595ae4e201dcdf25288bd8db63a2a3a75f6caaa6b30d0c04e2b645d14961f9f5a636a8)
---
for enchants, just get hp, stamina and intellect in every slot you can get. 22int on weapon, +100hp on head/legs (or zg enchant), +4 stats on chest, stam/int on bracer (i prefer int), agi on gloves, movement speed on boots.
---
this gearset can be farmed by every casualplayer since it mostly contains rep and pvp items. the ony head should be easy to get, the aq20 items are super easy obtainable aswell and the ring might of cenarius requires some combat badge grind (which is totally worth it since there is no other way of improving your weapon damage as cat). this will be my ultimate goal if i cant make it further than rank10. if you cant get past rank8 then you can switch the shoulders with AB exalted shoulders and the head with the wolfshead helm or bone ring helm. the second trinket is completely optional but i would go for a gadget rather than a statstick.
---
Feral with NS HT: [use this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxMTscMdxVxfoso). with this spec your goal is it to outlast your enemies. this will be the cookie cutter spec in phase 1 and 2 until you hit rank8 in pvp. itemization would look something like [this](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12dca6880be4965f706a27dd61a62ea26d004e0879979e4d72ebde59460b56c95f1a4ecf3a264f68afe8031652e6b41587ef643e61c75a6ca7db7bbe6c2fd11952c416885814b0e627f9246760d603bebf52c99fa1c50957b9620a1821c760c9e5d13c10c5641e349fa6fd3d33cd1209ce78158b17d81fa0f0fb642e5f7a7d369058b2575e01041252b0ec4438d9274e70e68bedfe9fca6c3282d8ee41ac1d62e278eb3aa65ce). for the gloves there are easier to get options like [these](https://itemization.info/item/15708) and some of the slots could be filled with any "... of the Eagle", "... of the Monkey" and "... of the Tiger" item, depending on what stats you want the most (mana, hp or dmg)
---
tl;dr: go back to the top this is the shortest version of pvp feral itemization you will ever find
---
The closest you'll get to a hybrid is something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0v0obZZVAG0octVo
---
That spec just isn't good, you're missing piercing ice, arctic reach, imp blizzard (good on nefarian and soloing) and arcane meditation for pve, while also missing permafrost, imp blizzard (1 point to be able to proc frostbite), arctic reach, piercing ice and imp coc for pvp.
---
But whatever, keep doubling down, admitting you might be wrong about something on the internet is the worst thing one could possibly imagine.
---
You can make an orc and then walk from your starter zone to undead starter zone and do all the quests or just stock up a fuck ton of cloth and do rep cloth turn ins which is 350 rep for 60 wool going up to runecloth so it will cost ya a fair bit of cloth.

Stay out of Turlyon forum if you know what’s good for you!! Damn kids in my forums.
---
&gt;Neither are you.
---
Great, I'm not claiming to be. The person I responded to literally was.  
---
&gt;If I as a rogue have a thrash blade, and a krul blade drops and I win it, I'm selling it.   
---
If you need for the purpose of selling instead of using, you're a ninja.   
---
&gt;If any other class purple boe drops, I'm stating I'm rolling need and selling it (or giving it to my guild bank).  
---
&gt;We all have needs. Gold enables mine, stats enable theirs. Rolling need
---
Gold is your greed, not your need. Otherwise the system of need/greed existing at all is pointless.
---
This only applies when the value of the item doesn't grossly exceed the utility.
---
I pirate a lot but I draw the line at operating systems.

**\[EU-PvE\] &lt;Truefaith&gt; \[Alliance\] Filthy Casuals Warning!**
---
**About Us:** \- We are reincarnation of vanilla WoW casual guild. Friendly and laid back, yet raiding capable group of nerds. Guild got to like half-way AQ40, which if you ask me is quite impressive for casuals, and that’s on Quel Thalas which was a realm added later, not at launch
---
We don’t focus on PvP tho we will not actively discourage PvP either (but seriously stop wasting time and come to raid ok?)
---
**PEGI 18** – chat gets a little weird sometimes, like last night when we were discussing if murlocks keep their copper coins in prison wallets, since they wear no clothes
---
**What We Provide:**
---
\- Hunter loot and Chuck Norris jokes
---
\- Knowhow … we were there, we did it, we had amazing time so we wanna do it again
---
\- Dire Maul sightseeing tours with a guide (Im so salty with will not be there at launch)
---
\- Friendly environment of adult people, we will jump into the dungeon to help you with your one dumb quest and we don’t care if grinding levels is more time efficient
---
\- Pooling resources, we work together to get our crafters up to speed. Especially if you get some of them juicy patterns from the goblin in Dire Maul (Yes I love the place!), get people Onyxia cloaks and resistance gear…
---
**What Are We looking For:**
---
\- Being casual guild makes this easy, we welcome everyone with good attitude, bad language is perfectly fine as long as it’s a joke. Insulting guildies is a no-no, but we like a good drama, just keep it civil
---
\- Open mind, WoW classic is very different from retail and if you were not there, you will just have to trust us. Some classes are better at certain things than others and you are welcome to do as you please in dungeons. Raids however are group effort and you will be expected to fill different roles when needed, depending on your class (aka when we say heal, you heal). You will also see paladins in cloth healing in MC, its actually really funny
---
\- Currently ***Warriors and Priests are closed for recruitment***, other classes still have slots open

If you resist their kidney shot, do they keep their combo points?
---
We were a shitpost lightning rod.
---
You keep that prestige by running around with your Giant 2H and Shiny Armour.
---
The Rank and Title comes from Active play. Just like the pop up kill and honor earned is for the persons Active rank, not their gear score or max rank earned.
---
I'm planning on playing a druid, so....both?  I'll be running around and kiting most of the time.
---
But overall, I have always gravitated towards either healers or melee DPS.
---
Straight backs and healthy skin.
---
I use NUM0 etc... but that's just because my extra mouse buttons have to emulate an actual keyboard button otherwise they won't work. So I had them set to my numpad buttons because I never use them anyway.
---
I can't sell extra gold or buy extra gold without a third party web site.
---
\[like this?\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoNY9UVr9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsoNY9UVr9E))
---
You don't level as 0/30/21 because that build doesn't take any of the good cat talents, instead level as deep feral, eventually ending in like 14/32/5 and then respec at max level into 0/30/21 for a couple of gold (first respec). 
---
Your levelling spec ends up looking something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxxMscrdtV where you take feral talents, then balance, then resto.
---
Concurrent player peaks are only in the 10 mil range total accounts created is in the 130+ million range saying there is "only"a few more million that have come and gone is a drastic understatement.  Put on top the fact that wow classic will sit between 500k to 1 million views for the first 2 weeks of launch on twitch(we know this based on top streamers that have committed to playing), it won't matter what game you started on or if you ever played millions will try out classicfor the first time on Aug 26th.
---
Same thing here!
---
I know people like that irl. I’m sure summoning food and water for free is annoying .....if they’re paying however...
---
Found the person thinking logically about the situation.*
---
Fixed it for you.
---
No need to level bank alt to 5 right at launch. Not going to need to DE or AH right away, but having him created will let me abuse the mailbox
---
Don't forget if you fuck up and get 3 points into a skill you only wanted to put 2 points into, that is ANOTHER FIFTY GOLD YOU MUST SPEND!
---
Warriors would like to have a word with you.
---
Everyone's just going to use a realm discord instead anyway.
---
On that note, respec prices that quickly grow astronomical. Like, up to 50 gold for a respec is just stupidly expensive, especially considering how hard to come by gold was during vanilla. And a decay of 5g per *month* is just insultingly slow. Really discourages experimenting with specs, since a mistake will be super expensive to fix.
---
no gearcancer addon pls. now get the fuck out
---
I just can't do it again. I love the aesthetic and utility so much but god it was so rough at max level. Probably either Mage or Hunter this time around with a Warrior alt.
---
25/26/0 paladin
---
Totally acceptable PVE healbot, just need gear. 
---
PVE farming is acceptable too but generally you want to be AOE'ing larger groups of level 52 or under mobs with consecrate, blessing of sanctuary, shield spikes.  Very possible to solo big chunks of lower level instances with clever use of your bubbles and other cooldowns.  
---
PVP monster with reck bombs, still same amount of healing support and utility, and extremely hard to kill. 
---
Really great paladin spec.  The only thing you REALLY can't do (like, completely cannot do) is PVE DPS.  Heh.  You do NOTHING.  it's sad.
---
Druids are one of the most fun classes you can play in PVP once you get the hang of them.  They have very high skillcaps that require a lot of game knowledge in order to play well.  But once you do...oooooh boy, are they a menace.
---
TIL I'm a polite rogue..3
---
It was literally every other thread back in the day. It was stupid how many were begging for it.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-priest/
---
fuck.
---
I'm saying that because it's an identity thing it's inherently subjective, and that there is a distinction, (however slight), from being known as a tank or as a player. Due to one's preferred identity being entirely up to the individual, that difference makes or breaks this discussion. The dude you were originally talking to seems to care more about being known as THE tank, rather than THE player. 
---
I'm not saying dual spec does or doesn't help the community, just pointing out what I think the difference between both of your positions. For what it's worth I personally am not a fan of dual speccing, but for other reasons entirely.
---
Yeah those are good points. Back to looking for a guild lol
---
Buildings
---
No.... please read the fucking post again man....... he is calling the "RULE" strange not actually playing that way.
---
You assumed, and assumed falsely why I labled it disingenous, because of the proof I asked for, w/o it is clearly just a made up gripe.
---
Damn I wish I had money....
---
&gt; If you aren’t a wage slave working insane hours to make your boss richer then maintaining a decent character is no problem
---
What the hell does this mean?  Are we looking favorably on unemployed people that sit around doing fuck all while playing WoW?  That seems like a worthless existence.
---
At this point if you don’t know the pathing to level quest by quest specifically. I would get to know the areas themselves and what level the questing requires.
---
Or you can always download a pserver and “practice” your path or route. (This is what I’ve done for a long time)
---
Like for an orc. Durotar, barrens, stone talon, ashenvale, 1k needles, STV, tanaris, plaguelands &amp; winter spring.
---
I play a warrior but, I still feel if Edgemasters or something drops it's a free for all. Just assuming you get a "free epic" that is worth thousands of gold because you can use it. Is delusional.

Raiding guild that will allow me to experience all the content classic wow has to offer. Im a uni student with lots of free time that I can dedicate to the guild. I want to grind and efficiently move through content with people i can be social/friends with. Im not a hardcore player by any means but Im excited to spend a significant amount of time in the game. I've always played retail solo and looking now for a group experience. 
---
**Experience**: Played retail since Cataclysm
---
Dont forget the forsaken slaughtering the last survivors of lordaeron after they helped them reconquer it.
---
Really feel sorry for the darkspears and tauren.
---
Every other troll tribe would fit perfectly in the horde but the darkspears.
---
 the alliance aids in fighting against the scarlet crusade despite the forsaken being the only threatened atm.
---
And every horde  thinking the scarlet crusade is evil should check their own history. Slaughtering others with the legion as an excuse but having done the same just a few years before that. 
---
And thats just the vanilla lore. 
---
Following up, the orcs end up being like nazis just to be defeated and bam, now the forsaken go totally out of bounds and show their savage side. 
---
The only bad thing the alliance did was releasing ilidan and not having the ressources to pay the working class after they almost lost one of the 3 remaining human kingdoms.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=16165/necro-knight all the drops off this guy, as an example
---
How are the Defias members of the alliance? Aren't some of them horde?
---
A pest not a menace.
---
Afaik it was mainly for rogues, because the server had shit tons of rogues. As a mage I had no problems finding groups.
---
Oh wow thanks so much, this is more than I'd ever imagined to see as a reply! I'm absolutely going to level a druid as well as a rogue and will bookmark this page.
---
Fazing our titanforging, putting back the old version of AV... 
---
It seems that they have no problems putting elements of classic back into wow, which would be amazing

Hordie here planning to intentionally skip those quests. Don’t judge the orcs/Tauren by the forsaken’s standards
---
FOLLOW YOUR HEART! If you roll something because someone else wanted you to you will not enjoy Classic as much. You want your toon to be fun and appealing to you. If you play a class because you hear they are good but you don’t like the particular lore behind them you’re probably going to be less likely to want to log in over time. Pick a class that’s appealing to you and a race you identify with. If you like your toon you’ll be so much more likely to have a fun time in Classic
---
I said it’s controversial because I am aware that WoW Classic is meant to be a faith recreation of Vanilla warts and all and not a Vanilla+. I was aware people may come at me and say that i’m playing the wrong game if I wanted a Vanilla+
---
Indeed.. an air cooler would just melt instantly.
---
Yes, but it made up for it with a shitload of endgame content, more than vanilla ever dreamed to have.
---
Vanillawise, every class has its counter. Warrior is Lock counterclass.
---
Vanilla had the right Scissors-Paper-Rock balance. You were predator and prey. TBC had absurdly OP setups compared to any WoW period, except 3.0 pallies.
---
Ya... this won't be how it plays out.
---
There will be 500k to a million watching on twitch.... Add up the avg viewers for the people planning on playing at launch.... If apex a game with no fan base hits 2 million concurrent players within days of launching, imagine a game with around 100million unique players Thought its history launching something and only 1% of that population playing your crazy to think this will be the actual numbers.
---
Same difference, really.
---
ninja my virginity
---
I am just starting a new job so I won’t be able to take off for release day and I’m devastated. People will be level 30 by the time I get to properly sit down and play that weekend. Adulting sucks
---
Well the guild will need to store gold aswell. Just not based off of taxing every gold drop.
---
Can I ask what class you’re going for?
---
I don't remember seeing those threads. Weird.
---
Mage can be a low and high skill gap.  
---
Regular mages in PvP and PvE are good. 
---
Beast mode mages are out of their mind in Classic. 
---
If you know how to play your class/spec well - you’ll be easily remembered by raid leaders and opposing factions to be killed in sight.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed/Thu/Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore |Point-based Loot Council
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm practice &amp; preparation now. We're accepting all great people who are willing to work to be their best.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed/Thu/Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
**Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.**
---
**Looking for**: We are specifically seeking: top tier Mages &amp; a Rogue class lead, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within Epoch please send let us know and we’ll chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild Jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot our Recruitment Officer Narphie#8585, or our Guildmaster a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up our assistant GM on **discord:  XvK#7740**

Are you on the right forums (US)? Dalaran is definitely under the list for normal realms.
---
Well of course you can change a few points depending of what you need more.

"Thick Hide doesn't benefit from the multipliers the way it seems like it should." What do you mean ? It's different on the beta ? Because almost 10% more armor is alot.

Feline swiftness is useless also.

# &lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST 
---
# Hello!
---
Coup is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene.
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game.
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
**What we are looking for:**
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us and contribute to a fun, supportive environment.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently progress through current/relevant content.
---
* For our raiders, we are looking for those who respect other’s time and are willing to put forth the effort required to help us maximize the time we have with our relaxed schedule.
---
   * Additionally, individuals who are willing to accept (and at times provide) constructive feedback to help the guild improve.
---
**What are aren’t looking for:**
---
* Overly toxic, racist, or homophobic behavior. We are all nerds and like to joke around with each other, but we never approve of alienating or exclusive behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a generally positive manner.
---
* Individuals looking to advance their own personal objectives over the objectives of the larger group. If you are overly focused on getting loot, pushing bleeding edge progression, or aren’t willing to integrate with and contribute to the guild community, this might not be the best environment for you.
---
FAQ:
---
* What loot system will Coup use?
---
   * This is somewhat TBD still, but likely **DKP with some sort of decay.** Ultimately our objectives are to reward effort and participation and encourage people to take upgrades when they are available. Hoarding is not something we want to support.
---
   * Legendaries are the exception and they will likely be awarded through some form of loot council.
---
* Will Coup require full consumables and world buffs for raiding?
---
   * **Initially, no.** When pushing progression we may enact guidelines around consumable usage, but flasks and world buffs are not required for content in phases 1-3.
---
   * **While we won’t tell you you can’t stack world buffs, we won’t force the raid to do it either, in general.** On that same coin, we also won’t tolerate social pressure or toxic behavior around this. If you take the time to gather world buffs that is totally your choice, but you shouldn’t fly off the handle at the raid if something happens and you happen to die early and lose them.
---
* What classes do you need the most?
---
   * **All classes and roles are open at this time.** We have a lot of time between where we are now and where we need to be when we first set foot in a raid and all roles are up for grabs in the guild. Raid roles will be granted based on a meritocracy. If you get raid ready by the time we want to start raiding and contribute positively to the community, there is an excellent chance you’ll be able to fill the role you want to fill on the class you want to play.
---
   * **This question is also an automatic red flag to me.** Play the class you want, not the class someone else tells you they need. When you let someone else influence your preferences for such a major commitment, it actually puts a very unfair onus on that other person/group to appease you and ensure you are happy and content playing the game. Ultimately finding the fun in the game is on you and “taking one for the team” is always a bad approach when it comes to class/role selection.

Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!

Says the faction who gets to hide from PvP until they're 25.
---
Lack of dual-spec. I honestly hate being confined to a single spec, and would love to have two so that I can experiment more without having to drop 50g every time I want to perform some other activity.
---
Now, the common counter-argument to this is usually some emotional crap about "ohhh it makes your choices feel important", no it doesn't since you can literally reset your talents any time you want, just for a hefty price. Dual spec changes nothing about vanilla other than making it so you don't have to hearth back to town and pay 50g then go back out to wherever you were.
---
I'd even accept a limited / restricted version of it for vanilla, like make it so you can only swap specs while in a Rested area, and have a 30 or 60 minute cooldown on it or something. I just want that freedom to swap to a DPS or tanking spec instead of being forced to heal and nothing else.
---
Ugh same..I was ret through BC and Wrath. As soon as holy power was implemented the class felt so different and in a bad way.
---
Druid. End of story.
---
This post isn't going to prevent a single person from being toxic.  No one is going to read this and go "you know, I was planning on being a total douchebag to everyone I meet, but this has really changed my mind!"
---
Why not both? If you don't care about how it fits on your head I will just make it strap on and it can be displayed with a foam head underneath.
---
For sure. One is for the kid and the other is for anything up to some vr work. So adequate for that :p
---
I think your confused mate. No point debating with you if you don't actually know what your debating.

**About us**: We are a rather young guild, formed only a few months ago with currently close to 150 members, consisting mostly of experienced vanilla veterans and/or """unofficial""" classic server players.
---
We intend to level at a medium pace. That means we won't stop to smell the roses or "explore" every corner of azeroth but we do not want to rush the game either. 
---
Instead we hope to do all sorts of fun guild activities together along the way, such as guild-only dungeon runs (off-meta builds aka. memespecs are fine, too), lots of pvp, etc.
---
Non-raiders, casuals and socials are very welcome to join us as well, as we're trying to build a big community rather than just a raid roster.
---

**What we can offer:**
---
- active and well designed discord server

---
**Recruitment**: We have a pretty balanced roster and don't lack any specific classes right now so we're recruiting every class and role (except Main Tanks for Phase 1).
---
We still need a warlock and a mage class leader though so we're currently looking for a socially capable player who knows the class inside and out in all context and is willing to help others. Class leaders will also be part of the loot councils and recruit more members of their class if needed.
---
If you're interested please contact me on Discord **[Howaito#3139]** or join **OUR SERVER (discord.gg/VquUGmu)** so we can get to know each other until Classic release!

---
Interesting. Not sure how they are going to square giving retail the OG AV map but not Classic.
---
I guess they have to add reinforcements so retail players can get their free mount at the end.
---
still lower than wow
---
Oh, I’m super undecided, but I’m pretty sure I’m rolling a healer of some sort. Druid most likely.
---
The release date being so far away
---
Range has a major advantage in vanilla. Its not like retail where every class has 10 gapclosers and crowd control. Warriors have intercept, thats it. Rogues has more ways to close gaps, but a good mage should still be favored.
---
If the item is something you'd equip because it's an upgrade to what you have now, it's a need scenario.
---
Greed otherwise. Just because you can use the money when you sell the item doesn't make it a need scenario unless when something drops that you can use but no one else can, except everyone can sell it, you're OK with everyone rolling need on it just to sell it.
---
If you are toxic in vanilla enjoy only being able to join other toxic people. Eventually people will know who you are.
---
Models and graphics form retail
---
"loose ends" conveys it really really well for me. "Glue" Confused me at first
---
I’ve been in plenty of groups with random people I don’t know and have aggred that blue BoEs should be needed for gold.
---
I will have to say respec costs as well. Being a raid healer and then wanting to farm or do anything after raids solo stunk.  Running into most classes solo who had any gear as a holy priest was certain death. You could get a farming alt but you miss opportunities on your main, whispers to run instances as an example. It would have been nice to have duel spec in classic.
---
Yeah, pretty much this.  Everyone loved mages for their aoe and food/water, warlocks for their summons, shamans for their totems, paladins for their buffs, etc...
---
Besides their DPS, rogues were only useful in certain dungeons for their lockpicking.
---
What’s the conversion from Naxx Bucks to Stanley Nickels?
---
Play what seems most fun to ya. To me a rogue was always the cooler class that I always wanted to be at 60, redemption time.
---
Pretty much. I could be Shadow Spec and heal in raids just fine.
---
There are lots of Druid PvP builds, but none that I can think of consider themselves instant cast nukes. NS is basically a lay on hands and should probably be saved for such IMO. I don’t think at any point an NS Wrath would make or break your damage
---
I'm still at work but it was in an interview with a level designer in the countdown to classic podcast. Great podcast too if you haven't checked it out.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I started a few months after BC was released. The hardest thing to get used to will be the lack of Summoning Stones.
---
Yep :) one entry level for the kid and one for me. The beefy one will also be used for vr.
---
Aren’t they adding that as an optional change?
---
i think your comment perfectly resembles the "thin skinned"-LGBTQ culture. if you're able to take a dick, you should be able to take a joke aswell. talking about a "safer community" as if saying some curses will make the people have a psychic meltdown is ridiculous. 
---
the question i always ask myself is, why most LGBTQ-people have to exaggerate their behaviour so everyone else in their environment get the state of their sexuality. if you behave like that, get used to be called out
---
Still one of the best wow movies.
---
I'd say horde is more of a chaotic neutral and alliance is a lawful good, but with lots of evil corruption seeping into the system that we won't talk about.
---
**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP (non-streamer server)| Raid Progression and World PVP**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;** &lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues, mostly in PDT and CDT time zones, that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing many expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW. Many of us played Vanilla WoW back in the glory days.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game raiding content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a consistent progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
While we don't expect everyone to no-life to level 60, we do plan on holding ourselves to a respectable standard when raiding.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate. 
---
Our raid times are tentative, but this is our current plan: 
---
Running 20-man raids on Tuesdays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
Running 40-man raids on Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT and Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;World PvP&gt;** Many of us are interested in running some pre-made BG's when they are introduced, though that isn't the primary focus of our core members. We will look to setup nights for ***coordinated*** world PvP. We have time until BG's are ready, so let's terrorize some Alliance scum and have some fun!
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all people who are passionate about what they play. Our current roster is available here: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing
---
Tank Demand: Low

Oh 100%! I'm neither complaining nor asking for a change - although I could see how it would be read that way given the context of the original post (derp on my part). I love the long crafting. I didn't care about RP stuff as a kid but now that I'm older I love the RP value and immersion of actually taking more than 3 seconds to create something. I guess I was just trying to say that it blew my brains - totally forgot about that aspect of the game.
---
I’ll admit it: I thought wrong of people. I’ll start doing this too. I mean, you’re right, it’s really smart to just say everything is an upgrade and then sell it. I’ll have shitty gear lying in my bags and then put it on before the fight and say that everything is an upgrade, and then vendor it after the run.
---
We’re gonna be rich.
---
Hell yeah! This is what I wanted to hear. Sounds really rewarding honestly; sounds like a good dark souls boss, when you prevail it feels that much better. Glad to hear that, at the end of the day, it’s just good ol’ fun.
---
It’s been a while but I played vanilla wow and hit 60 right when guilds were starting to get AQ on farm.
---
I play exclusively for the PvP and I was exalted with WSG and AB before 60 and AV exalted slightly after 60. 
---
When I hit 60, I went right into the PVP blues with some epics from bg reputation.
---
In bgs and world pvp, since I was a fresh 60 going against AQ gear, I found that druids are very much able to go toe to toe while wearing pvp hybrid gear. 
---
I don’t recall my exact spec, I think it was deep enough into balance to get Omen, which wasn’t a popular spec.
---
Assuming you go against equally skilled players wearing raid gear, I found that you absolutely have the potential to beat every single class...EXCEPT warlocks. Maybe it’s me but I vividly remember avoiding warlocks 1v1 at all costs since their death coil, fear chains, and life drain made it impossible to win.
---
Warriors in best in slot gear are always a problem and take lots of effort to slowly grind them down.
---
Fighting nearly all classes is a war of attrition. The Druid shines at outlasting nearly every class in sustained fights. So if you go in to each fight expecting it to take time, you WILL win (except against warlocks).
---
My best friend also played a Druid and raided frequently. While his gear certainly put out more DPS, we both had the same results in pvp. I just had to last longer since it took longer to kill players and I had to shift to heal myself more often.
---
Even in  mostly blues, from what I recall my win rates in duels/bg/wpvp looked like this:
---
Nearly 100% win rate
---
Mages (unless they are Pom pyro and get lucky)
---
Paladins (takes forever)
---
Rogues (if you jump them)
---
75% win rate:
---
Warriors
---
Shadow priests 
---
hunters
---
Below 50%
---
Warlocks 
---
Druids strength is they don’t need cooldowns to win. So I’d often find myself running away to reset a fight if I started losing advantage. And then stealth back in and start again now that their cooldowns were down. Outlast, outlast, outlast!!!
---
Hybrid shifting is key!  Use the form best for the situation.
---
Personally I like rogues. But the color rouge is nice too.
---
My squad is literally making twinks from the start. Not everyone plays the same way.
---
Bet cooked seal taste good.
---
But the reason why Blizzard started hiding those numbers was the whole circlejerk around WoD because there were people screaming "DEAD GAME DEAD GAME" into an echochamber and it propelled a negative spiral (that and the fact that WoD was a shitty expansion outside of raiding).
---
I am, as are several other vocal priests on this subreddit. However, the old survey had undead outnumbering trolls by a huge number. Idk if the new survey will be different, but it won't matter because a small subset of the classic player base actually use the forums and reddit. I'm guessing undead will still be super popular on horde.
---
I see nothing but the same people you do.  Bashing BFA, while nothing in classic servers could ever be misunderstood or misused in any form.
---
Rouge.....
---
If Fallout:NV is playable, you're totally fine.
---
Exactly. I think everyone just wants to be the best and in doing so forgets to have fun.
---
You must be real fun to game with
---
me :)
---
Cuz I am gonna gank yo ass &lt;3
---
The majority of players will burn out before 60 lol
---
The great part of this mouse is the g shift. You can hold it and it augments the 12 buttons. On top of this you can use shift/control hold with the buttons for further augmentation. You can have literally everything on your mouse! I love this mouse, you made a good choice!
---
Are you saying in BFA it’s easier or harder to find a spot as a hunter? 
---
(This is what I was going to play)
---
My point was that if they havent tried any of the expansions by now, they havent been waiting for classic, they just dont play wow. Im also skeptical of shroud's commitment, he played the beta for a few days at best, then went back to his FPS streams.
---
rank10 on druid is worth it since you wont get much better items for head and shoulders until rank13 or aq40. the wsg rep legs are insanely good aswell.
---
because im bored i put together the bis (in my opinion) itemlist for feral pvp: [click here](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12dca6880be4965f706a27dd51f64ec2cd004e0879979e4d72db8ef9460b56c95f1ade1f0a564f68afe8032652d6b41587ef643e61f70a0cf7ab7bbe6c2fd129228456785814b0e627f914471046e3bebf52c99fa1b5297779620a1821c7609995f19c10c5641e349fa61d7da3bd1209ce78158b27988f7030fb642e5f7a4d468048d2575e01041252b07c4448f9274e70e68bedcebf9a0c3282d8ee41ac1d6292e8cd8db63a2a3a75f6caaa6b30d0c04e2b645d14961f9f5a636a8)

maybe you could get other neck and rings, but i like to keep it simple and easy. the hardest parts of this set are the bracers, the belt and the rank13 stuff. everything else is pretty much uncontested and you will get it by default if you raid long enough. this is the literal feral dream
---
Achievements like this are fine, the only bummer with achieves is when you are an entry level raider and people are only accepting players with proof that they have completed it, i.e. the achievement. 
---
This has been especially frustrating in current retail when trying to queue up for Op: Mechagon

&lt;Competent Casuals&gt;
---
| NA Server TBA | Alliance-PVE | Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding]
---
* **ABOUT US**
---
Looking for a casual raiding guild that'll still progress, are adults, aren't up their own asses and just want to make new memories in classic with you?
---
We're a casual oriented friend/family guild that will be rolling on an alliance PVE realm. We're a raiding guild first and foremost but still plan to dabble in PvP for sure. The guild was made with adults in mind. So those that have jobs, families and a life outside of wow yet know how to bring it during the weekend and raid nights is exactly the type of person I made this guild for. Casual yet competent.
---
* **GOALS**
---
We're NOT in a rush to hit max level. Of course raiding is in our sights and I expect us to get going around Dec / Jan or so. However, I want you to take your time. Smell the roses etc. Once we’re all hitting max level and have some early dungeon gear we WILL be raiding and taking it fairly seriously.
---
* **RAID SCHEDULE (Central Standard Time)**
---
We're thinking weekends in the evening once MC gets underway. 2 nights a week (Fri Sat or Sat Sun) with a much more casual mid week raid night that’ll be ZG / AQ 20 etc.
---
* **LOOT**
---
DKP and Loot Council with a stronger emphasis on DKP. There’s rare exceptions we might allow someone to get an advance on their DKP (tanks healers) for the sake of progression. For the most part things are going to be as fair as possible. This is a promise to anyone that joins.
---
* **EXPECTATIONS**
---
Please check out the guild website for expectations / rules and policies etc.
---
For more info please checkout our website https://guild.competentcasuals.com
---
Link to Discord can be found on the site. Please look over the rules first.
---
Here's my argument and I won't be commenting further. If a BoE epic drops that could sell for 500g everyone should roll need. That money could go towards your mount or a Pre-Bis item on the AH. I look at BoE's like a big pile of gold. Everyone can use gold therefore everyone should roll. This, IMO, is the definition of fair. Everyone gets a fair shot at a big pile of gold or a nice shiny new item. I understand that not everyone sees it that way but I think giving the item to someone just because they are lucky to be a class that can use it is unfair.
---
Holy paladin dps = Shockadin they can even tank dungeons if played properly.
---
In need of at 60 relative to their representation (On PServers) - Warlock &gt; Rogue &gt; Hunter
---
Fun (In PvE) - Hunter &gt; Rogue &gt; Warlock
---
Most like a retail class - None. Fury warrior is the only thing I believe comes close
---
In general Alliance always needs more warlocks, raids only need around 2 Hunters so it’s a bit competitive to get a spot but you’ll get fed gear if you get it, and Rogue is top tier DPS but rather boring in PVE still and there’s a lot of them
---
Wait....what version is Classic getting?  I was under the impression it was the layer 1.12 variant and not the original,  epic IMHO, version.
---
Dude I feel you, 26yo no kids steady job and chill gf. Let the good times roll.
---
When Classic retail goes live, will that mean Vanilla players are considered part of the retail crowd? I guess we will have to start saying "BFA crowd"
---
Druids are a viable MT (in many of the raid encounters as well) and excellent OT.
---
That's how it'll be in Classic. Those changes were largely done before 1.12.
---
Nah, it was simply for testing purposes.
---
That's sort of my point, but maybe you were agreeing with me? Unless you think 39 twinks are running around doing dungeons? Either way twink items are really nice finds when trying to afford all of the shit end game content is going to wreck you with. Definitely has helped me at least.
---
It's an intentionally kinda crappy meme build designed to do both heals and DPS. You aren't in shadowform, so you still have access to EVERY spell you know, so you can smite. Also, a quarter of your spirit is added to your damage and heals.
---
I plan on doing an enhance / resto spec and plan on dps or healing dungeons and in PvP. I’ll just bring a lot of water.
---
LoL  and where did you get the authority to decide otherwise?
---
I don’t think anyone cares about Preach to be honest. Well, atleast his crowd is not cancer like Asmongold’s and Forsen’s. The latter being the big «no-go» if you are avoiding streamers in EU. But I’m not sure if Forsen will play Classic all that much.

They hid the numbers because they were misleading to investors (They started making way more money from micro-transactions).
---
But I'm not saying they have to bring them back for retail, just for Classic WoW.
---
I can't comprehend so many things.
---
Good song, but it sounds really nothing like the original.  I was trying to remember the source material while listening to this version and absolutely could not do it.
---
 &lt;Eagle Knights&gt; \[NA\] \[A\] \[PvE\] 
---
We are semi-hardcore, our main goal is to create a community of skilled,team-minded individuals,who not only love to play WoW Classic and other games(Arma 3,Overwatch,Smite,etc) but to creates friendships &amp; memories that will last a life time. No matter your interest, if your a veteran, brand new to the game, or some where in between all are welcome. 
---
What we are looking for in members: 
---
 We want to build our community first,without a community we do not have a true guild, regardless of class we desire Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing with a friendly group, and a willingness to help their fellow guild members.We don't expect everyone to know everything, but what we do expect is for everyone to be willing to learn and improve in their abilities,when we are able to begin Raiding we expect a proactive approach from our guild members.
---
Raid Scheduled:
---
TBD,we are still working on building the foundation of our guild,we are currently beginning to build our roster.I do not forsee us raiding until mid-october time frame but things can always change as the need arises!
---
Recruitment Needs:
---
We are open to all players looking for a place to call home,but we are also in the need of class leaders.If you are interested in one of these Positions by all means DM me and we can find out if you fit the position!
---
About Us:Many of us did not play the original launch of WoW Vanilla and are excited to get into it,we all want one thing,to enjoy games with a great group of people.Many of our original members are military and welcome Veterans and other currently serving members with open arms!
---
Feel free to take a look at our Guild info and see if we are a fit for you!

#THEX IS HAPPENING
---
Laughs in holyreckoning.
---
lolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
---
If you see a R14 that just means he farmed BG's for months, steamrolling new players, and dropping out of BG's when he faced another enemy R14 group. R14 was just an almost endless grind, that ended in collusion with all the other people trying for R14, including the "enemies".
---
I think all of this arguing about BoEs can easily be sorted by establishing expectations.  Just tell the people in any group you are leading what the loot rules will be.  Then if a BoE Epic or blue drops, everyone knows where they stand.  If they don't like your stance on this issue, they can make their own group.
---
Yep! Plus you have some interesting counters. Mages are monsters in PvP but one of Druid’s best matchups. If you catch a rogue out of stealth they’re screwed too, as long as you Leo abolish up to waste their blind
---
Just spec soul link if you want to kill rogues (and everyone else).
---
You say they got it right then tell how unbalanced warlocks war, so they got it right... for locks.  I played Shaman and yea they "tried" to make elemental/enhance viable but it just wasn't, you had to go resto to be taken seriously.
---
Don’t feel bad, I’m playing on a 10 year old MacBook Pro! You could fry eggs on it after about an hour of play 😂😂
---
May as well be what happened to Arthas. He "died" in a narrative sense when he took up frostmourne, and became a new person entirely.
---
I started playing back in either 2004 or 2005, I'd have been 12 or 13 at the time and hadn't played an MMO before except a bit of messing around on the original Runescape. I got into an SFK group that was getting run through by a high level character. We came across a chest at one point and I ran over and looted it. The high level guy got pissed off at me over ninjaing and left and I didn't even know what I did wrong. I still really don't know why this guy got pissed over a chest in a low level dungeon that had a potion, some food, and some cloth.
---
I plan on having 10 alts just like I did as a child, one for every class/race with a Warrior being on each faction.
---
Bounce back and forth to your heart's content!
---
No, if you want to keep your gold you should plan your spec ahead of time.
---
He’s the only eu streamer I know about so I figured I’d say it.
---
Good god! finally!!!
---
Yeah no problem.  Below is a list of steps to get to Org from TB and vice versa:
---
1. Walk.
---
What you hated about the Priest in Vanilla?
---
Bort?
---
*I See Red, I See Dead - Alliance PVP*
---
Semi-Hardcore PVE &amp; PVP Guild
---
Currently sitting at about 15-20 members of close friends. Most of us age range between 23-28. Most working, military, in school. Planning on adding members through here and people we meet online to eventually fill out the roster.
---
Many of us have raided vanilla til current retail. Most of us have simply been playing misc. games with one another while we wait for this legendary game to return. 
---
Most of us are based in the west coast, but we are flexible with our raid times and will determine what times fit the majority of the raid when we fill out our ranks. As of now, something like 1 weekday + 1-2 weekend days. Start times could be anywhere from 5-6-7 start time based on member schedules. 
---
**What do we wanna do?**
---
We want to relive classic, as most of us feel it was the best gaming experience we've ever had. We plan on doing all raid content, world pvp, bgs, and misc fun bull to pass the time. Progression in raids is a priority. Another one of our focuses is establishing a strong sense of community within our guild. Helping one another, enjoying each other's presence, and having good times is our main social goal. 
---
**Loot &amp; Recruitment**
---
At the moment we are open to recruiting anyone who wants to enjoy themselves with a good group, whilst still challenging and pushing their character to see positive raiding/pvp progression results. We have a decent spread of roles as it is, so any role is acceptable. Loot will be determined via council, the dedicated reap the rewards. Those that show up and show they care about forming a community will be rewarded. Please feel free to message me and I'll get back to you in detail and answer any questions you may have. I can hook you up with a discord invite if you are ultimately interested. Happy gaming yall.
---
I'm not claiming any authority.   
---
The claim is that the system is designed with need as use, greed as gold. Any other method you ever employ, results in the greed button becoming redundant.
---
I had issues where vanish wouldn't work because of the fire aura breaking me out. Sometimes vanish wouldn't work properly. I think after my third try on the last pack it worked.
---
I love the idea of really... sinking my teeth into something. I’ve always been a hardcore, unapologetic altoholic. Because of this I look forward to dedicating most of my time to one toon this time around. I’m a much more patient person now than I was when I was 10 at vanilla launch. You and another commenter have really intensified and reaffirmed my urge to play druid.
---
No point discussing this with you further when you can’t even attempt to approach it logically. 
---
Nobody is talking about vendor trash. We’re talking about valuable boes that could sell for hundreds of gold. You really think people wouldn’t choose to sell a purple that is a 2% upgrade, buy an epic mount, then run another dungeon to get the blue that is a 1.5% upgrade? If you can’t acknowledge people would do that you are poorly attempting to troll.
---
This is the one, all others will be removed!

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**  "Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment.    
---
**Expectations from members** We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**  Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://senilechieftains.com/](https://senilechieftains.com/) for more info!
---
Sorry but I play blizzard games specifically to be toxic. Something about their thin skinned players makes it especially more fun than elsewhere.
---
Sounds good
---
 Legacy (NA/PVE) Weekend raiding guild.
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment, especially warriors/rogues/mages
---
**Misc:**
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
* Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even  
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
* World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
* Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK  
---
 . Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
EDIT: High demand for dps, especially warriors/rogues/mages
---
Honor system, and CC abilities lasting waaaaay too long.
---
I see you planed for smashing your mouse in anger at some point.
---
Because we get it in 9 days after character name reservation.
---
Yeah, that's just not a good guide. I would just refrain from posting those altogether, all you're doing is reinforcing cliches and discouraging players from playing what they like.
---
Anyone know why Moonrunner isn't on the PVE realm list you can search for old acquaintances on??
---
Write down a list of all the cool shit you could do as a hunter and you might start leaning that way. I was a hunter back in vanilla.  Debated going multiple other classes at launch but hunter always wins out.  Feign Death alone edges all the other classes out for me.  Also, beating Rogues in duels with a lvl 1 bow has to count for something in the Rogue vs Hunter choice :P
---
Right now in BFA I bet you'd easily find a spot in a Mythic raiding guild as a hunter, my guild was full of them though.  Ranged is always welcome in most Mythic raiding guilds, its melee DPS that is often full because most Mythic guilds don't bring more than 4 melee.
---
Sad part is that horde gets pwned in wpvp when the alliance actually fights back instead of running away.
---
The fact that i win as human warlock against udead warlocks 90% of the time actually kinda disappoints me...
---
This logic applies to the supression room as well in bwl
---
Explorer was always my favorite. I remember seeing the title in the ads leading up to WotLK, and I knew I had to have that achieve/title.
---
Wow, that is a glaring example of what is wrong with the game.
---
Is it weird that I have a chubby?
---
Right because getting sulfuras is really difficult! You have to clear MC D:
---
I imagine your group would have much different loot rules than the other 99.9% of players then..
---
Making your own popcorn is a good one.  It's pretty low calorie for a snack food if you use straight kernels in a hot air popper, pot, or pan.  Even putting your own butter on it is way better than getting a per-seasoned microwave bag.
---
Any pally ones? /cry
---
*sad doot*
---
You're not going to get an authentic experience with that gear.
---
#nochanges
---
You're gonna be 24 hours after everyone else
---
They are a top 4 leveler and its not even close. Spirit tap + improved wands, stack spirit items and target wand upgrades. You kill shit pretty fast and never go below 85% hp which makes you hard to gank.
---
* (Any reference to "Active" characters, refers to characters that have claimed the ["Dress-up Raubahn"](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/3a1c40b5f2e/) mount from the 4.1 story)
---
That's like only counting players that hit max level in wow
---
That is not even the topic right now...
---
the equation for gravity includes distance (radius), which will always be changing under gravitational acceleration.
---
This has me hyped but also worried! I could get my name (Going for a common first name), but if I choose a realm and get all of my friends to go there I could get a warning about queues later and not have my name if I switch to another realm :(
---
Between that worry and it secretly turning out I’m on a streamer server... ahhhh Thex bless my soul
---
Tank / healer / dps.
---
Make 2 top pick for each Group. 
---
Now try pick :)
---
If you see a class keeps showing up (hybid classes) you should go it!
---
First one I was introduced too was LoL. Played for a while, was getting annoyed at the pay-to-win (ish) of having to farm for the heroes and level the talents. 
---
Had a few games of Dota and never looked back, over 6000 or so games logged on Dota. Dota was the bees knees. Picking a hero in Dota is more fun than an entire game of LoL.
---
Yeah, AOTC achievements were a mistake.
---
I don't know many others but a short clip of Guidelime I saw looked great. Would love if this was an ingame addon as that's more my style :D
---
Warriors are going to be a tough journey but important for raids and Dungeons.. and well rogues, will be on the lookout to always gank such as myself lol,
---
&gt; Market value =/= player value. 1g is not equally valuable to every player. 
---
Are you trying to argue that we should give consideration to players who are worse at making gold than others? 
---
&gt; Oh, so you're the arbiter of the exact point where gold is worth ignoring and where it isn't? I didn't realise that. Where did you get the authority to make such decisions? 
---
Oh, my mistake. Everything is subjective, but it's also somehow impossible for a community to come together and share an opinion. Yep, never happens. Thanks for correcting me.
---
&gt; 8/10 is a number pulled from the nether, but even if it wasn't. Yes it is fair if he's actually using them. 
---
I gave 8/10 as a fairly accurate approximation. We disagree that he's entitled to them for his choice of class.
---
Besides alcor's which I already listed, only elemental mage staff and sash of mercy could be called "expensive".
---
I didnt say no one new, just not enough new players to bump the subs up to 10 mil
---
FACTION WAR, FACTION WAR!
---
First Attacks of Orcs were from the Humans attacking the orgs who pillagered in the Swamp of Sorrows. It's only after this incident that the orcs got more aggressive into gaining the territory there...
---
Hol' up. Ele shaman got a 3% spell crit totem and some pretty good mana retention. Enhance got dual wield, which while I personally feel is less fun/within fantasy, definitely smoothed out their dps with the ability to effectively double their amount of windfury procs. They didn't really peak until WotLK, but honestly, what class didn't?
---
&gt;If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during the name reservation/character creation process, we will post warnings about the potential for long queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms.
---
remember when picking ur realm that thx to layers popular realms will be more valuable and encourage other realms to b more ded, if you don't want to get stuck on a dead realm full of toursists ignore the warnings and queue right up :^)
---
As long as it runs it runs bro!
---
Good to hear, this is basically what I expected. I had one Transgender (guy to girl) in a guild once and it was actually interesting when we had a short chat about it. The transformation wasn't completely done by that time and you could still hear it a bit by the voice - which I think was the reason we started talking about it.
---
Anyways, thanks for the reply!
---
You wouldn't really be able to zerg past hte front line in the original AV.  People tend to forget how insanely covered in NPCs AV was upon release.  It used to be a huge deal to make a push and kill one of the roaming generals because of how hard they would stomp people.
---
That's me!  Over 2k hours of VANILLA rogue pvp right here baby.
---
Then they have to drink again so you can sap them again.
---
I tossed up this idea months ago, maybe displaying faction percentages alongside each realm. I got shot down
---
Who needs healthy skin when I am green and manly
---
Yes, I feed on rogue tears. Nothing feels better than to gank someone who’s entire class choice was about griefing others
---
Nothing.
---
The Ryzen 5 / Radeon 5700 will be played on a gdm-fw900. No kidding ;)
---
#**&lt;Rising&gt;**
---
We're **&lt;Rising&gt;!** A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
**Introduction**
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play. Although we do not have an age requirement as such, we are an adult guild. The majority of our guild are 25/30+ so should you wish to apply take that into consideration.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 23:30 CET for progression raids, although we do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (particularly at the start).
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is fairly young, we are starting to get a solid core raiding team together. At the moment our class preferences can be seen on our website. However, if you see your class listed as low priority or even closed, we are always open for exceptional candidates so feel free to still apply.
---
For loot we're adopting a fair and transparent Loot Council system for raiding with a management team that’s been running raiding guilds for nearly 15 years.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. Personally, a lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values.
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @[Rising] Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, @mizi#3868 or @QFierced#7447.

**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
Pet battles
---
I'll be honest, I loathe it, when people ask for special features to be introduced, because it'd be "fun", when they could just do some grunt work and do exactly what they propose, simply within the confines of what the game already offers. 
---
It's just lazy.
---
You haven't seen a druid cast tranquility I think.
---
how
---
You think that when retail players see a new (free) game out on the bnet launcher they aren't going to want to play that?
---
You also think that all of those players are going to quit retail and keep playing classic?
---
The kid. Don’t blame me :p
---
I know exactly which race, gender, class, spec, prof I'm going to play. They usually chang day to day.
---
In America salary = you work until the  big man tells you to go home
---
I'd call that a straight PvP spec, like how Sp/imp is straight PvE
---
Damn I love buffing, or getting buffs, from strangers on the road. They do the little hop to say thanks/you welcome.
---
10 million would be less the 10% of all unique players to playthe game ever you don't even need "new players" to hit those numbers...
---
Yea. They tried to fuck me lol.
---
Heres a question I also have; how well do druids scale with gear? Warriors get big fat crits and cleaves, mages do insane damage but what goes on with a Druid?
---
If you dont mind runners, pick a spot with level 55ish humanoid mobs that doesn't have a ton of traffic from other players and kill them over and over again. They drop cloth and major healing/mana potions and currency. Lotsa little nooks you can occupy in WPL, EPL.
---
If runners annoy you, pick a spot with 55ish beasts. They can drop a healthy supply of vendor trash items as well as useful crafting mats. Bats/hounds/grubs in EPL or Bugs in silithusif you can handle poison, maybe boars/basilisks in Blasted lands for example.
---
I wish I could slap money down on a half decent PC but tbh it's one of those things I just dont need. I play all my other games on xbox because that's what my friends play on, only PC game I play is WoW and you dont need anything mad for that haha.
---
Going 5/5 Feral Aggression before lvl 32 is 100% useless as druids don't even get ferocious bite until then. And the attack power reduction from demo roar really isn't worth much. Even after lvl 32, ferocious bite is such a small portion of your dps, the talent isn't worth 5 points. I never take it while leveling or at 60 for any role, tanking or dps. 
---
Also, there is no reason to skip feral charge in any druid leveling build. It provides excellent utility as a gap closer, and for one point is a no brainer. 
---
Furthermore, always get the two points in feline swiftness as soon as you possibly can (lvls 20 and 21). The increased movement speed is going to help you far more than anything else you could get.
---
Oh you wanted to buy those edgemaster handguards off the AH? Sadly the fanboys chipped in and purchased it to hand off to asmongold. Better luck next time
---
Ah my bad then, redditing and public transit clearly isn't a good combo for me
---
yea, pretty good metric

Human Rogue Engineering and Mining
---
maybe I wasn't, I'll check again, thx for tip
---
They aren't even releasing this version of AV in classic - I feel like it's such a tease.  I really really enjoyed the strategic pushes and defenses of the original AV.  "Alliance group coming through the mountain pass"   "Pull the general back through our line so we can kill him"
---
Now it's just going to be "WHO THE HELL CAPPED SNOWFALL GY WE LOSE"  When originally, it was a really contested GY since it enabled the front line pushes
---
You can try to grab the name on 3 different servers to be safe!
---
It is not.
---
Create own group. /w healer and tank classes directly.
---
Usually takes 5mins at max.
---
Getting a dps will then be the easiest.
---
Ps: creating own group means you can decide what classes and what lvl they will be.
---
why not? with 40 people in a raid, you can afford to have a few people using total meme builds.
---
Guess I can equip everything as a warrior.  So rolling need on everything.  Thanks for the tip.
---
why selecting a thread where the most important part (names coming later this week) isnt included in the title?
---
&gt; Are you trying to argue that we should give consideration to players who are worse at making gold than others?
---
No. I'm trying to argue that need is for use and greed is for gold.
---
I am dismissing the claim that market value is the same for everyone. Not only does market value fluctuate on a daily basis, but gold in and of itself has different value to different players that you can't even begin to evaluate on an objective basis.
---
&gt;Oh, my mistake. Everything is subjective, but it's also somehow impossible for a community to come together and share an opinion. Yep, never happens. Thanks for correcting me.
---
Not everything is subjective. It is objective for example that using need/greed the way you suggest makes greed become a redundant button, which means it is contrary to design.
---
&gt;We disagree that he's entitled to them for his choice of class.
---
He's entitled to a chance to roll for what he intends to use, against other people of the same.  He's also entitled to greed for what he intends to sell, against other people of the same.
---
Ima purge ur world buffs.
---
Fuck rogue, you want warrior dude!
---
Shadowmeld is OK, but I think it is outshined by Dwarf and Gnome racials in PvP. However if you really like NE I wouldn't worry too much about racials.
---
Hey Mister, can we have our Happy Fun Rock back? It went over the fence and landed in your Turalyon.
---
Except that it does not become redundant as you still use it for BOP's.  
---
Would you agree that maybe the best way to handle this situation is to just not join pugs that have a looting system that you disagree with?  
---
This argument is almost religious in how strongly people feel about it, and I think we both know that we are not changing anyone else's religion as we all believe in the one correct god.
---
If its arguing for arguments sake though, have at it.
---
Shadow priest always welcome in my 5 mans.
---
I think the difference between vanilla leveling back then and now is that the time spent on that first character you start realizing how much you have messed up and the allure of other characters. I know for 1 I made a rogue to start. Didn’t understand leveling professions and stuff. Made a shaman in a newly opened server and rushed it to 40 trying to be as fast as possible (again skipping things like professions) and a bunch of other alts because my buddies were on 2 different servers before finally going back to my rogue. This time around I think the hardest thing is making that decision, but ultimately will be easier to stick with it.
---
Good idea! How many servers could there be someone that’s named Thex irl?
---
If he's anything like me, 6-6 is implying waking up/leaving at 6am and getting back home by 6pm.
---
For me, I leave the house at 6:30 AM, get to work around 7:30 AM, leave at 4:30 PM, and get home around 5:45 PM, sometimes after 6 depending on traffic or the day itself. Just the nature of being salaried; you are paid to be there 8 hours and lunch doesn't count so in reality it's a 9 hour work day.
---
For WPVP, they are pretty great.  In BGs, have fun guarding flags.
---
Doesn't surprise me, this post is being downvoted simply for asking the question. People out here downvoting anything really.
---
Okey, sounds and looks good and clear, hopefully raid groups dont care if I have imp. Mark of the wild or not.
---
So do you view the rich backstory that supplies the race with conflict and motivation to grow and change which lends itself to interesting story telling and story arcs as a bad thing? 
---
Or does being part of being part of the generic good guy squad tickle your fancy more?
---
Thanks for the context.

The sub will last u til a week and a half ish after classic launch. It's just 15$ tbh
---
They’re extremely good, but have a pretty boring role in BGs. In WPVP they’re a blast
---
Thanks for the useful feedback anything that can help people is amazing.
---
I remember when people used to hate it when we would take Snowfall Graveyard on Horde side, because it would make the Alliance turtle and slow the game down.  But we did it anyway, because it was fun.
---
Because its supposed to BE unbalanced só its fun...
---
Lol is that the role that everyone wants you to do in BGs?
---
Back in the day, I joined a match at 0/0 neutral, and hit exalted before the match ended.  There really wasn't a reason to "win."  It was a frontline bloodbath
---
Pserver players make up such a tiny fragment of the population. Do you really think the masses are going to listen to a handful of people who played on an incorrectly tuned server for a few years?
---
Agree, Would it really ruin the game if they reduced the mana cost of a couple of spells so that specializations like Shadow Priest and Balance Druids could last a single boss fight without running out of mana halfway through?
---
That's why you go and to reserve your name on many servers right off the bat
---
Ok I won't. Thanks.
---
Since those 130 mil didnt stick it out, what makes you think they would resub to play the most base version of the game?

**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: EPGP with LC oversight for at least a few months to see how much the guild and the leadership like it. If EPGP is deemed to be not good. We will use Loot Council instead, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exact details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

they'll all quit by week 2 rite?
---
meanwhile everybody who's willing to wait in a queue is likely gonna stick around
---
Rogues are incredibly world PvPers. Their gank potential is insane, and probably the class that tilts the most people in world PvP.
---
If you intend to actually use it. Yes.   
---
Otherwise, you're a ninja.
---
Why are they boring in BGs?
---
Do you have a reference/source for the AV that will be in Classic? I was under the (incorrect) assumption it will be the version that was on Nost.
---
I have only seen most recent mods there so far. I'm hoping that in Classic there might be a subdirectory or something more obvious.
---
Pservers have the advantage of hindsight.  When Naxx released nobody had been gear more than 2 to 3 tanks.  There had never been a need and there just wasn't the time.  Naxx existed for 6 months before Burning Crusade.  That is 24 lockouts worth of raiding, at best.
---
Hybrids, don't work at all.  All of those Druids/Shaman/Paladins are going to be pissed when they have to heal or re-roll.
---
Hey man, if you're NA and going Horde, hit me up. Got a great group of personal friends and former guildies throughout the years prepping for Classic. :)
---
The new one isn't letting me see anything unless I sign in, which I don't want to do.
---
Since you don't get paid by the hour (as you would when paid by wages), you are at your job mercy and can do very little when they force you to work longer hours :(
---
Ah yes 3.0 pallies, I remember the pre-wotlk patch launch. Playing AB and if you saw a try pally all 7 of you just turned and ran.
---
Uhhhh dude. Peter Jackson specifically put Legolas in The Hobbit to make damn sure kids these days still know who he is. Have some faith! How many orcs has hawkeye killed? None. Checkmate.
---
slower solo play
---
I don't like how powerful engineering is. That being said I will be doing engineering.
---
I wonder if it would be better with Paladin and Shaman all the way at each end, because they're the ones that are unique to alliance and Horde.
---
It could be like a spectrum of lawful to chaotic. Maybe: paladin, priest, mage, warrior, hunter, rogue, druid, warlock, shaman
---
Nobody ever blames the dps when the raid wipes
---
Uhm yea that's the price you pay for being a dps. Everyone wants to do big damage, gank people in PvP, farm really easily, all that shit. But when i say i want to find a group in 2mins it's "a problem for everyone else" because they can't do that?
---
There are pros and cons to everything. Saying that every con is a problem that needs to be fixed is ridiculous.
---
And yea, you don't need a prot warrior to do a dungeon. But if you're going for speed and trying to tank a lvl 60 dungeon as fury in your greens and blues, it's gonna be a lot slower than someone who is actually specced prot, in 99% of the cases. Maybe if you have a group that is way overgeared it may not be an issue, but usually it is.
---
How can you tell whether it's full with tourists or natives?
---
Its called Big debuffs
---
I don’t want a second spec that’s free all the time they cost progressively more up to 50g. After a month the cost is reduced by like 5g idk if my numbers are exact
---
Fiery enchant for Ultimate Carnage
---
There’s a common RShammy build that’s part Ele that’s still a monster in PVP, but yes it’s probably best that you heal. The tier is itemized for healing so Ele doesn’t wear tier, and in general yes Ele won’t have mana to last a full fight.
---
That being said, Ele’s damage is some of the highest burst in the game and makes them a blast in PvP and dungeons (You’ll likely just AOE pull off the tank in dungeons). If you wanted to find a guild that had an Ele spot it would be possible, but would be a casual guild

As unpleasant as the graveyard runbacks are, I think it adds tension to combat because you don’t want to waste time running back to your corpse. And I think the tension makes the combat more fun and engaging

**About Us :**  Im not one for the long winded copy / paste that says the same shit that every guild recruiting post says.  We were the best on the server or vying for the best during vanilla.  We no lifed it and, 5 hour raid days 5 days a week.  Been there done that.  We are taking a different approach this time around.  We will get shit done at a focused, but way more relaxed DRAMA FREE pace.  Our core is 16-18 players that played together during vanilla and have stayed in touch or gamed together since then.  Some of our member(s) have top 10 naxx40 vanilla kills (not pserver bullshit).   
---
**Loot System :**  Its a class based Loot council.  Very fair system.  No favorites here.  See discord for more info.    
---
**Requirements :** Have professions that make sense.  Don't be a priest with blacksmithing.  No, we arent requiring every damned person to go engineering.  Really? lol!  We also expect people to show up for raids prepared.  Other than this , do your very best and above all, have fun.  We are drama free.  Any drama or ass hattery and its a gboot.  We want you active in discord from now through launch.  If you are going to join now and be inactive, don't bother wasting your time.    
---
**Needs :**  We have never nor will we ever over-recruit.  We don't need 90 people.  We dont need 31 raid teams.  We keep the team small.    
---
We are pretty much full on everything with the exception of :     
---
**Off-Tank : 1**   
---
**Fury Warrior : 2-3**   
---
**Rogue : 2-3**     
---
**Applying :** We don't do silly ass guild applications.  If you can make our raid times (listed in the header), aren't going to cause drama, and are a good guy/girl, feel free to join the discord below and DM me for access to our channels.  Be active.  Bam, part of the team.  You don't have to worry about feeling out a 10 page application that most people lie on anyways.

I'll always think of this of one of the best machinima wow videos ever made.

It didn't need dialogue or text or anything, just a brief introduction and then music kicks in and all kind of feels happen. And the music is perfect, so fitting.

---
Whhhaaaatttt
---
Feral/Resto
---
Ele/Resto
---
SM/Ruin
---
Holy/Prot
---
Those are the 4 best pve/p specs I know of
---
People have (and will continue to) raid and PVE in PVP specs.  It's not optimal, but it save gold.
---
As for your first question, yes...but also no.  Can you get a raid spot?  Sure.  The average guild will take whatever worm body they can get their hands on if they are short.  But you WILL have mana problems.  For some fights it won't be an issue, especially if the predictions are correct and content will be easier.  You can alleviate some mana issues by downranking your spells, but then your dps suffers.  It's a tradeoff.
---
Try to raid as Elemental, but be prepared to go resto if the raid needs you to.
---
A ninja is someone that breaks the rules of the group to get loot.
---
I played an orc warrior in vanilla and can say that Arms was pretty awesome, especially with a bit of gear. A rogue would go to gank you in BGs and you’d still have a good chance at sinking your axe into him.
---
As long as I have at least 30 fps and a half decent render distance I'm happy as Larry
---
You guessed wrong. I played a mage in vanilla from MC through Naxx and every expansion since. I'm aware that the AP frost spec is more popular now than it was before, but that was not the case in vanilla. A mage will be just fine raiding as deep frost throughout all of Classic. It's not optimal but I made that clear from the get go. Mage doesn't lose as much from taking a more pvp friendly talent build compared to other classes.
---
Yeah but a duel is 1 on 1 and a controlled environment. To me that’s the equivalent of not letting a stealthy get an opener.  A mage should have to use blink in the beginning, etc. Sure you could find a rogue and knock them outta stealth but the reality is that most likely in World PvP they getting the jump.
---
Well, you won't be doing much @ lvl 60 without friends or a solid hybrid spec (there are no solid hybrid specs outside of maybe Ele/Resto for Shaman).
---
So that's going to suck. Healers also take way more consumables than most other classes, like mana pots and runes, and unless you're buying gold then you'll need to them, which makes your life doubly hell when combined with the above.
---
So basically the biggest downside is you're almost guaranteed to require an alt 60 just for farming purposes alone, which is a huge, huge time investment that's taken away from developing your main.
---
As someone who didn't reach max level until TBC, what was it that changed that made the strategy different? It's hard for me to imagine some version of AV where the optimal strategy isn't just rushing the end.
---
My friends call me Thex.
---
Some of these tips are just next level autism tbf
---
Can't get both Ruin and Soul Link
---
Would also give more time to do character customization too
---
Thanks !
---
Did you play TBC? Getting your first flying mount was a grind. Granted it turned into a pretty unfun grind of dailies, but it wasn't totally trivial.
---
Yes it will. Metas happen because pros or the majority go "this is good". For a week the meta might not be as apparent, but it will be there.
---
I like my souls bloody
---
If you have windfury/sword spec, or anything else that can proc extra attacks. 
---
If you don't have those, don't worry about your swing timer.
---
Edgemasters dont work on 2h weapons. So I feel as orc just hope for a BRE, Spinal or deathbringer phase 1 and w one of those you wont need Edgies.
---
Shadow priest, SL warlock and reckoning paladin are the best sustain specs in the game making them the gods of 1v1/1v2 but they're not great pve specs and aren't competitive in premades. Hunters aren't amazing DPS but they're god tier in WSG, AB and world pvp because of their utility and burst.  
---
Druids aren't the best pve healers, but they're the absolute best flag runners in the entire game and amazing world pvp healers since it's almost impossible to pin them down in an ambush and take them out before their group can help them out.
---
If you approach classic WoW with the mentality that specs are at the center of your class' role, that's not necessarily how things play themselves out. Your spec isn't what determines your role, talent specs are there to offer you choice in how to enhance the strengths of your class. Your role is determined by what your class is the strongest at.
---
No way. 
---
Having played holy priest end-game extensively, casters are the ones that don’t really bother you since you can dispel everything, outheal the damage if you know how to bait interrupts, and you have mana burn!
---
Rogues, warriors, and hunters are the real problem. Constant spell pushback, warriors break fear, rogues chain stun, and hunters viper sting will all be a nightmare to deal with.
---
Guild banks did not come out until TBC
---
Alliance in Vanilla generally wins AV because of Pallys and other lvl 60 BGS for the same reason. There is also an advantage given to Alliance early in the phases because of the Paladin Buff in regard to PVE top tier raiding.  That being said, paladin is arguably the most difficult class to level in comparison to the other classes (except maybe warrior).  But if you are going for PVP in smaller 1v1/1v2/2v2 situations Horde are generally better because of their racial. I.E. Orcs dodging 1/5 of all stuns, Tauren's pocket interrupts, and Undead breaking CC at will (pun).  So in summery:
---
 Horde are the best PVPers at small skirmishes 1v1/1v2/2v1/2v2 because of racials. They also have a PVE Min/Max advantage in later phases because of Warchiefs Blessing. 
---
Alliance are better at large scale battles because of the mechanics of Paladins and later level BGs for the same reason. Alliance are also better at earlier Phases PVE wise because the Paladin allows them to get more dps out of the raid before all the World Buffs are released in later phases.
---
Shamans are very limited in raiding. Only the most casual guilds would accept an elemental shaman.
---
I leveled my shaman back in vanilla because I thought elemental was such a cool spec. Sadly it just does not work in raiding and I was quickly forced to switch to healing.
---
Almost no gear overlaps between elemental and resto. You will need two different gearsets.
---
You can choose to raid as resto and PvP as elemental but you will have to pay 50g each time you wanna respec.
---
I get why you wanna play elemental, but if I were you, I would save many tears and just go with a different caster. (Mage, Warlock, Shadow Priest)
---
Yeah, in the open world I’m at around 30, but in raids and major cities I’m at 10-15. It’s brutal
---
1. No
---
2. Yep.
---
3. Pretty much.
---
\*laughs in Horde\*
---
I ganked people as a young fella and now older, I have the need to gank harder well at lest better :P
---
Yeah, no Iceblock and IceBarrier feels so horrible to play as frost.
---
I had absurdly long queues on my server (80/20 balance) so it was difficult to rank up in pvp.
---
So I played mage with a pve spec and gear for a long time.
---
Being made out of paper would be an understatement, it is ridiculous how squishy mage is like that.
---
I get too car sick and miss reading a word here and there for sure.
---
Yes and windfury.
---
I think you might be surprised to see how many people would want to try the version of the game that became a cultural phenomenon. Especially that we know it will be #1 on Twitch and that alone will get people interested.
---
Tidal charm is going to be such a pain to get in 2019. It was so awesome first learning about this item back in vanilla and it feeling like an insider's secret. Prince Nazjek is going to be dead 24/7 on every server.
---
1. How seriously do you want to raid? Casually? Hardcore? If you're going to raid here and there, Ele will be fine. You'll struggle more trying to get a spot as Ele than if you were Resto, there's no denying it. But you'll be able to join PuGs or a casual guild as Ele I'm sure. 
---
2. Gearing is a bit different. As Ele, you want +Spell Damage and this doesn't increase your Healing output. If you want to be efficient in both, you'll need two different sets of gear. You could probably get by with a hodgepodge of stuff for both specs but you'd be far from optimal by doing so.
---
Really hoping they give us a RPPVP realm.
---
Thex Thecret Thervice (or Thervith?
---
&gt;will be able to create up to three characters per WoW account

Probably worth noting that it is \*not\* 3 characters per Realm but \*\*3 characters per Account\*\*
---
Black, like my demons.
---
Alright thank. What if it misses?
---
Well... online gaming communities tend to be quite awful so it's not really a language abuse if you see that term used so much around them.
---
Then "toxic" has a specific meaning: it's someone (you know or who is part of your community/circle so a bit hard to avoid without leaving) who has a very negative attitude or habits that affect the mood of the people around. It doesn't mean that this person is an asshole or stupid, it's more sucking out the fun and making everyone around them as miserable as they are.
---
What synonym would you use?
---
I mained a rogue in vanilla.  They're not boring in BGs and you can still top the kill meters if that's your thing.  If you go Gnome, you've got another out for being CC'd, you've got sprint and vanish to get away (as long as you're not DoT'd to hell by a warlock/Spriest), blind to stop people in combat, evasion for rogues and warriors (rather eat an overpower on cooldown than all their melee hits, hamstring, rend, etc) and then do it all over again if you're sub spec with preparation to reset timers.
---
The fact that servers are so prone to imbalance. People have gotten used to private servers which are always close to 50/50 because the whole community is on the same realm. I think people are forgetting how only a small number of realms were balanced in vanilla, most people were stuck on 70/30 or worse. Even PvP servers were unbalanced more often than not. 
---
This kinda stopped mattering after vanilla because there was no world content anymore and transfer policies became more loose. Paid transfers weren't even introduced until 1.11 and we don't know how/if Blizzard will faciliate it in Classic. Back in vanilla, transfers had a bunch of restrictions; for instance, you could only bring up to 300g with you, and you could only transfer once every six months.

under what game version do you see them? There is very little under 1.13, but rather 8.1 or 8.2
---
They removed elite mobs in the middle and mines. Bosses were also more buffed so you needed quite a lot of people north/south.
---
Yeah what this guy said.
---
*cries in holy pally*
---
Yes and getting basic flying was easy. Also epic mounts are a) not flying and b) not usable in AV
---
Yeah.
---
Your guys were influenced by the legion and not with the age of 6.
---
No there isn’t. Faction based reps for the alliance or horde races allow you to get that races mount and I vaguely believe that a 10% discount on that cities vendors. So basically useless considering the amount of work it takes unless you really want that races mount. Night elf rep tended to be popular since everyone wanted the damn cat. 
---
The rep for the 4 goblin towns that are organized under the steedlewheel cartel to my memory are 100% useless and don’t award you essentially anything. 
---
There are reps that have vendors that give you awards ect but you can pretty much grind their rep and get rep from their quests at level 60 so you don’t need to give it thought while leveling. Also most of the rewards are flavor rewards or profession recipes. The profession recipes are useful but easily obtained usually around honored / revered. Exalted usually awards some sort of item that’s cool to have but not really gamebreaking or amazing. So all of them are strictly optional. 
---
Reputations and their awards where done really different in classic compared to retail where there was usually robust rewards or things that essentially required you to do it. I wouldn’t worry about rep at all until your 60. You can then also do the questing if you were so compelled for the lore of whatever but do be warned that the questing the zones had prior to the cata rework where actually fairly bland and dry from lore so you wouldn’t be missing much if you simply just waited to do them for when you’re leveling an alt.
---
pull faster, let the dps finish off the last 20% of the health of current pack of mobs. Focus on establishing threat on the new pack of mobs. Dont waste rage during the last 20% of health on the current pack of mobs. Just pool rage for the next pack and pull fast so you gaurantee threat. constantly look at healers mana ever couple of seconds will help you know your pulling limits. if healer is low on mana you can always hamstring mobs and kite them around and outrage their melee range or los them so the healer can regen mana
---
I liked priest. Leveled shadow and had no difficulty healing groups until 58+ dungeons. Strath/Scholo/LBRS runs could get a bit dicey but having a hybrid in the group meant legitimate backup heals/wipe prevention.
---
I can’t say anything past there but once you spec into Holy/Disc for MC expect soloing and grinding quest gear to slow down to where you wanna go back to shadow.
---
Yeah I’m definitely leaning towards a mage after all the feed back. Shammys are a blast!
---
Got it.  Argument for arguments sake.  You win, and I guess we will just never have the pleasure of grouping and running a dungeon together.
---
1. Yep 
---
1. Yep
---
The name is use has never been taken and I get compliments on it occasionally. Also trying to get that “Leroy” name as well (yep, yep I said it).
---
Bad hunters.
---
As a Ret paladin, when they added self heals to rogue and warrior, I was like “wtf. This is the main reason I picked Ret paladin over those classes.”
---
The difference isn't even close, and some classes don't even have good pvp sets. 
---
Who do you think is more gimped? a hunter with full tier 2 with chromag xbow who missed out on his pvp gloves he would never wear due to the tier set bonus, or a fully blue pvp hunter with gorewood bow? Because with the same weekly time commitment it takes to get rank 10, I can raid MC/Onyxia/BWL no problem.
---
They changed it so people could test out different specs without having to grind for gold. It won't be like that on release.
---
Well **I** didnt pretend to be the good guy
---
Orc Smash!
---
Me too!
---
Two E's
---
I once had a guild leader who pointed out that I did low dps, so after the raid we spent a few moments together to check the skill tree and to train the class, this was a great experience
---
I'll be playing prot pally, I'm hoping to go far but not expecting it. At 60, I'll do dungeons until I've got BiS pre-raiding gear, hopefully convince a few raid groups to let me off-tank, find a guild that would take me, build up a good enough reputation on my server. 
---
I don't know how far I'll get, but I'll take it slow. I just wanna try.
---
This right here is the attitude I am talking about. You have no info on how classic will be except a beta that wasn't a final build and didn't go to top level and yet you blather about how pirate servers were "Harder". Those players will have a harder time adjusting to not having a go-go-go attitude. Classic will be much bigger than pirate servers, and the tryhards will be outnumbered by people just playing the game. Get a rep as a douche who is always pulling things and bitching about the way someone tanks, enjoy not ever getting groups.

Seeking to establish a guild that is **fundamentally about PvP**, and **ignores PvE raiding**. Dark Spirit seeks to recruit primarily those interested in Druid, Priest, and Shaman classes of all specs. Ignore raid drama, forget heal-botting, and kick in some alliance teeth. **Rank, not Raid!**
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Servertype**: PVP
---
**Time Zone:** US East (EDT/EST)
---
**Event Time**: Every other day, primetime
---
**Main Classes:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
**Alt Classes:** Any
---
**wPVP &amp; BGs:** Yes
---
**PvE Raiding:** No
---
**Optional Twink Bracket:** 19
---
**Phased Progression**
---
* Phase 1: Core Quests &amp; Dungeons for key equipment quest rewards. Twink prep. wPvP zone control &amp; town raiding.
---
* Phase 2+: sPvP Reputation &amp; Rank 10+ gear progression
---
**Events &amp; Schedule**
---
* Guild event every other day, loosely primetime EST, as strict scheduling is not as necessary as PvE raiding. As such, other NA time zones may not be a problem.
---
* sPvP/BG , wPvP zone/town raid, key quests, etc.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cme48e/what_class_should_i_play_to_get_corrupted/). 
---
I really like comments so far. "Thick Skin" obviously is something everyone should work on, but also communication. Of course you can't communicate with little Kevin and Justin when they're queuing together and just screeching in Voice chat (just a Meme, no names actually related to people), but everyone else can be talked to at least until a certain barrier is reached where things might get stuck.
---
I'm with you that many insults are just "how can I try to Trigger this Person the most" comments. If you mentioned you're gay anywhere and they know - yeah of course there are comments of this sort coming, because they think that's a weak spot. (Not defending it)
---
I liked pvping as a healing priest and most players had no idea how to itemise for it. Armor was really good because the biggest threats were physical damage dealers (warriors, rogues) but it was hard to come by. (It's the reason they added extra armour to the arathi basin items for example - the high end pvp community influenced it most likely) 
---
At any rate, my guild was raiding in AQ40 and a pair of trash gloves dropped that had nothing but int, stam and buttloads of armor. I was like hell yeah I want that for sure but the raidleader decided that it was better for the guild to disenchant it since it was not a raid item. Left them on the spot. Still annoyed by it 13 years later
---
Nope haha just an old black Dell CRT. Can’t remember what the model # was before I painted over everything lol
---
If classic is a success, Activision WILL say so during a quarterly earnings call.
---
The only thing I see is under the actual game. I guess the way mine is sorted is by first, the addons I have installed already. I haven't looked down the list (in fact, am going out of town so can't check until later this week).
---
You're essentially just a weaker mage with some smaller trade offs like having a lower CD/lower duration interrupt and the major trade off of being able to heal and buff allies. In order to match the damage output of the game's premier pure-dps caster, it's going to cost your mana. That's not to say elemental is bad, it's just not as specialized for that particular task as mages are. Your ebb and flow in terms of damage is going to be a lot more spiky. It's a bit more of an opportunistic playstyle because of that, but if you can play to those openings well enough while properly utilizing your other unique shaman strengths like healing/buffs, it'll be good and worthwhile.
---
That said, don't get Elemental Mastery, dip into resto and get Nature's Swiftness instead. You should be off-speccing resto anyway, so it's not much different.
---
I still remember a guild finding out after about 8 months or so I wasn't gay and they were all a bit confused! I had never told them I was not was it a guild that advertised as LGBTQ+ but it seems they all thought I was a guy, and therefore when I had mentioned my partner, and then later used the term boyfriend, they all took it as me being gay. Never noticed any difference in how I was treated between being a gay man and a straight woman. Which was nice :)
---
Not having the transmog feature, which is not a big deal.
---
You literally can't bash BfA enough.  It deserves every bit of hate it gets.
---
Oh I just assumed there was some default ordering you were drawing on.
---
I really like the idea of identity as you say. The problem for me back in vanilla was when i got bored waiting for raids as prot warrior i rolled a priest, eventually spending more time on my priest so it became my main, but same story there, went holy and just had to find something else to play between raids so another reroll... And thats the story how i became an alt-o-holic.
---
This is the most r/classicwow comment I can imagine.
---
&gt;Except that, the system works fine day after day with thousands of players all around the world agreeing to roll need on all BOE.
---
I mean gold selling works fine day after day with thousands of players engaging in it. Does that mean everyone should?
---
&gt;If I'm running a pug, I get to choose if I make a button redundant.
---
Neither said nor implied you don't.
---
&gt;My game, my rules
---
Your group your rules, but yes. Provided you're clear.
---
&gt;Rolling need on BOE works and we have proof it works because groups do it.
---
&gt;Rolling greed on BOE works and we have proof it works because groups do it.
---
Exploiting the WSG flag behind the map works and we have proof because people have done it.

There have been ways to get around Daze since WoD on Retail.

Okay, now I have an image of an undead rogue holding the limp corpse of a gnome mage over a cliff Simba-style while 'Circle of Life' plays.
---
NE hunters are confirmed to be able to shadowmeld while using Eyes of the Beast in Classic.
---
That's a pretty viable argument in favor of NE, imo, even without factoring in the convenience of a safe afk session. They also have the highest base agility.

&gt;Character name reservation for WoW Classic opens next week on Monday, August 12 at 3:00 p.m. PDT. Players with an active subscription or game time on their World of Warcraft account will be able to create up to three characters per WoW account and have the name(s) reserved before WoW Classic releases worldwide on Monday, August 26 at 3:00 p.m. PDT.  
---
&gt;We will release details regarding realm names and realm types later this week so you can coordinate with your friends on where to begin your adventure. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during the name reservation/character creation process, we will post warnings about the potential for long queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms. Also please note: Character creation will be limited to only one faction per realm on PvP realms.  
---
&gt;After release, the number of WoW Classic character that can be created per WoW game account will change to the following limits:  
---
&gt;A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm.  
---
&gt;A maximum of 50 characters across all WoW Classic realms in your region.  
---
&gt;Only one faction per realm on PvP realms.  
---
&gt;There is no overlap regarding character limits with World of Warcraft, so if you have 50 characters in Battle for Azeroth you can create 50 more characters in WoW Classic.  
---
&gt;WoW Classic’s worldwide release is almost here so it’s time to get started organizing and planning your path to level 60!
---
Wait, you thought the funniest part was the funniest part?  I dunno if I can get behind that statement.
---
This was how I got my first epic mount at 60 I thinkZ pretty sure I did AV for the stormcharger ram or whatever it just costed like 100 marks or so. Was more fun than just farming for gold for a long time at least. And my PvP skills improved a bunch over that time.
---
you best cut it out w/ that toxic masculinity!
---
I agree, the Humans putting the Orcs into internment camps and turning their backs on the High Elves who taught them magic and their fellow Humans of Lordaeron who were victims of the Scourge was absolutely heinous
---
It is amazing and they scale pretty well! A warrior will do more, but the rogue has more tools. I think you should decide based on preferred playstyle, you will kick ass with either.
---
Preparing for the raids. I just can't play casually and in order to play in top guilds you need to invest time so it almost becomes a job. This time I will try to find a balance.
---
its Frost as mage until AQ40, because Onyxia,MC and BWL all have high fire resist. As to proffesions Tailoring has a very good robe that will last until phase 3+, if you plan on pvp consider pairing it with engineering.
---
No one's forgetting anything, we've been playing this version of AV for the last couple of years.
---
You can kill most of the named elites with a few people, and nearly any class can kite them with a slow.
---
The minelayer can cause a bit of trouble if no one knows what he does, but you can zerg through it easily.
---
It's not for arguments sake. It's for the sake of how the system is literally designed.

---
Event queues are shorter and this event rewards a mount so it should be fine
---
As a Druid I prefer bears over twinks, just sayin.
---
It's still only -20% threat.
---
Counter argument: Rank 14 weapons are available before BWL is even released, and are BiS for melee until Naxx.
---
You only have a point when you ignore the things that prove me correct. Please refrain from further retardation.
---
- It's BIS for Mage Phase 1 (or close)
---
- It's worth 500G on the AH
---
- Most classes have a 500G BIS BOE on the AH
---
So realistically, **--Staff of Jordan is BIS for literally everyone--** Everyone except Mage just needs an extra step.
---
Needs more Rammstein!

There is honor in finding resources for your clan.  There is honor in defeating your enemy and driving them from lands your people need.  There is honor in putting them down to be sure they do not return.  
---
Honor isn’t a matter of morality.  It’s nebulous community points you get for acting in the interests of the group.  Making a deal with the demons wasn’t wrong because of some inate evil, it was a bad decision for the group because those demons ended up calling the shots and had no interest in orc prosperity as a whole.  Gul’dan wasn’t an honorless dog because he consorted with demons, but because he betrayed the horde to feed his own lust for power. 
---
That child you spare may end up a soldier out for vengeance in time, that girl you spare may end up the mother of half a dozen soldiers, raised to try and retake their land.  The only rules in war are the ones you make up to make yourself feel better.
---
The humans did the same thing to the trolls, as did the elves.  Every race is perfectly content to drive every “other” out of “their” territory, and even genocide them because they are a threat.  There is no greater good in all of this.  Just animals killing each other, like they always do.
---
I plan in joining or starting a Twink guild once my main gets in a normal raid routine. But not even going to think about it till then
---
I honestly thought they were pretty versatile in premade BG’s. You are strongest doing things like picking off people in transit or guarding nodes / flags. So you are taking sort of a supporting role. But there’s definitely other things your capable of doing in team fight situations depending on the team fight. 
---
Honestly I feel like you’ll be infinitely more frustrated playing hunter then a rogue. Hunters where hard as fuck to play and between deadzoning, and their cc diminishing returns it’s going to be a frustrating class to play and probably a challenging one to gear. Only truly dedicated people played hunters well at higher levels. So if you’re on the fence of what to roll the answer is basically never hunter. You need to really want to play hunter.
---
were you US?  the forums linked are the EU forums
---
You should have enough gold for flying just from questing to 70.
---
agreed, you CAN put one point into balance early on around mid twenties early thirties just to avoid ganking a little easier. It makes the roots to travel/cat form combo pretty easy if you're being attacked by both a mob and player around 50% hp. I highly suggest taking one in balance early if on a high pop pvp server. Side Note: if someone is brave enough to attack you at full hp, you'll win most of those encounters if you play it right, with the exceptions of hunters or higher leveled warlocks. 
---
It's also good to consider going full 31 points into feral tree then getting furor immediately after. You can also play with getting furor after you get feral charge and feline swiftness. (absolute MUSTS for leveling). Furor early also can save you a lot in early world pvp because you will certainly be switching forms 2/3 times a fight (against mages(to break novas, chilled effects, and land bashes/ charges) , rogues (pop out to abolish poisons apply FF(pre FF talent), hunters(pop out for hibernate, shift for concusive shots).  The extra rage and energy is insane. NOT TO MENTION if you stack it with the wolfshead helm.

We are looking to *bewitch and charm* players interested in all types of content, from raiding, to PvP, to social events. Anyone and everyone planning to try out Classic WoW is welcome, experienced or not. We will be lead by a core of old school Vanilla WoW raiders who have evolved with the game over the years and have played retail for over 13 years. Shirviu, our glorious guild master, has done extensive research on how to progress through each phase of Classic as they launch, and will ensure each member is prepared regardless of their skillset. We welcome both hardcore raiders and casuals alike, as well as non-raiders who simply want to hang out and have fun.

The guild’s strength will be in its unity, friendships, and trust in one another. (&amp; our leader’s insane knowledge of this game; no seriously, she legit cried when Classic was announced.) The officer core will operate with the best interest of its members at the forefront, and will ensure each member is treated with kindness and respect.

**[NA PVE HORDE]** LF1M DPS for 5 man dungeon grind. 12+ hours per day, for the first week. The goal is to be as far past 50 (or at least 50) by the end of Sunday. Part of our group will be returning to their regular work schedules afterward. So our main goal is to get the workers high enough that level discrepancy between group members isn't a big deal. Enabling the group to reform when workers get off work; and those that aren't working to play solo without worry during the workday. Perfect group for people who only took the *first* week off and not the second!
---
That's how I want my community. As far as I can tell I'm hetero (only had relations with women so far and not felt attracted to men) and I barely every had experiences with ideological people that are extreme in the weirdest ways. But when I meet those people it always confuses the hell out of me.
---
Kinda off-topic: I remember seeing someone called "Koreanisch" which is the german word for "korean"  so I whispered him "What does your name mean, I can't read it" because I was making a pun about his name written in "korean". Not that he just didn't get the pun, he also started spaming me with racial slur and Nazi-paroles and treated me as he things foreigners should be treated. Even after explaining the joke behind my whisper he just kept going and called me all kinds of names.
---
One of the most ridiculous moments in my life so far. I still have the Screenshots I think.
---
i generally use names from magic the gathering
---
I'll be happy as long as there aren't that many people spamming "ofc, ofc" all classic long.  I like Payo but the ofc thing needs to start and end with him.
---
And if Edgemaster's drops, I fully expect you to roll Need on them!
---
Then sell it and buy a SoJ.
---
Mages stay viable as a class all the way through Classic.  They're great for pulling large DPS and once you're past level 20 it should be a fairly smooth ride to level 60, they have a lot of utility. 
---
Most mages will be running frost while leveling for AOE spells and strong single target with some builds if you're soloing.
---
Frost will be used all the way through MC and BWL and then there will be a swap to fire spec for the remainder of Classic.
---
Actually, for a short period of time it was an insta-cast.
---
If they do tbc classic i will go prot paladin as it was actually playable in raids. But no, not in vanilla.
---
Thank you, very valuable information! CTF is my favorite game type in every game (nothing beats the short lived bioshock 2 multiplayer CTF imo but that’s a different conversation) so I’m super stoked for that. Something about CTF is very exhilarating  to me so I was ecstatic to hear that druids are essential in a CTF comp.

Limitation of debuff. Why group 40 people if they aren't allowed to play ? My warlock jsut spam shadowbolt, warrior can't use their bleeding, rogue have no poison. The raid content is an impoverished version of the game and it's awful
---
I remember this one, but numa numa is always gonna be my fav..
---
If you want to guarantee a mount @ 40, without farming, don't buy shit.
---
If you want to be spending hours farming, go ahead and waste your gold on shitty lvl 25 weapons.
---
OP asked how to guarantee a mount @ 40. I answered with the only logical and true answer that doesn't involve farming, with personal experience backing it up.
---
Everyone else on this thread agrees, buying gear regardless of class is NOT going to help you get 100g faster. It's ridiculous to imply that it will.
---
If you don't care about having 100g in your pocket @ 40, or don't mind farming @ 35-40, then do whatever you want. But that's a mute point and not what OP was asking.

Leveling wise, druid is a cake walk only beaten out by Warlocks/ Huntards.  Dungeon wise people will tend to avoid you unless a friend vouches for you or there is a dps class that can res on board. For this reason I would recommend getting Engineering/ Jumper Cables. Which you need to do if you plan on PVPing anyway. 
---
Once you get to raids the dynamic will change a little. At first you will be fighting with under geared shamens / pallies on the meters because your heals will be low. Your heals are "eh" at this point so your most important job is to innervate the mage with ignite up or the warlock with all the Spriest stacks. You will be on the lower side of healing until you get to 8 pieces of T2 and hit haste soft cap. This will be a night and day difference healing wise as your Rejuvs will be buffed and have you beating most shamens, pallies, other druids and undergeared priests.  You then sit at 8/8 t2 untill you can replace each gear with the BiS item. This will reduce the ticks of your rejuv slightly as you replace the 8/8 t2 BUT the jump in Healing Power will more than make up the difference.

Hope this helps!

Player Looking for - EU Guild on a PVP Server (UK Based player) Playing Priest (Holy) Alliance (open to Horde)
---
Hello thanks for taking the time to read.
---
I started playing wow a month or so before Patch 1.5 but didn't start raiding until ZG was released.
---
I started in MC and eventually worked my way through to Nax killing 5 bosses (I didn't kill C'thun in AQ40).
---
During that time I was playing a Holy Paladin working my way up from a raid member to class leader and eventually Raid leader. I lead raids in MC, Ony, AQ20 and ZG. When it came to AQ40 and Nax I moved to a more hardcore guild.
---
During TBC I raided Hardcore Chasing Server first kills clearing all content. I'm used to farming consumables and know what is expected of me.
---
Outside of raiding I helped many Rank 14's in pre-mades healing them and being a core member of those groups. I didn't chase that grind myself but happily helped those wanting it.
---
I also continually helped those in the guild wanting to do 5-mans / 10-mans and I plan to do the same when Classic comes out.
---
What i'm looking for in a guild is -
---
EU Guild on a PVP Server (UK Based player)
---
Due to my work and family life now I'm looking for a weekend Raiding guild (Friday and Saturday evenings). With that I'd only be a raid member and unable to fulfil any other roll, or give it justice with the time it deserves.
---
I would like to be able to eventually be in a position with the guild to clear Nax, but in no rush to do that.
---
During the week if I can get online it'll be spent doing dungeons/ pvp'ing or farming. Possibly the odd raid.
---
This time around I plan on rolling a Priest (holy).
---
I plan also to stay Alliance but open to play Horde.
---
I've 2 weeks off work when Classic is released and hope to get to 60 during that time.
---
Thanks once again for your time and hopefully there is a guild of like minded people for me.

Was also time of the boomkin, starfall stunning everything even whatever was in stealth. Was a boomkin in tbc greens killing t6 players with 1 skill

Will send them their names back if the price is right.
---
Will it be part of the addon by default or will you have a link to add that as well?
---
Leather has a very low profit margin, even lower than usual at launch. Unless you want to level an lw later, vendor it.
---
I really hope that guy is not an image of the average classic player
---
Well shit, that's perfect.
---
On spotify its called "Liquid DNB &lt;3 Liquicity!" with an orange waterfall pic. I cant link it atm cause I am at work.
---
As a 'retail player' the last RMT I did in WoW was a server transfer in Wrath. I have to admit though that new Ethereal Transmorph toy is pretty tempting...
---
If they don't, start a free trial of logmein or similar remote desktop tools and do it from your phone.
---
Likely because if you're wiping in dungeons your likely at max level and need 5 people to clear.
---
I want the new spell effects and animation a from retail.
---
I find that jerking it helps.
---
[A blue post months ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2zg97/alterac_valley_in_classic/). That and, you know, everything being 1.12 unless explicitly stated otherwise like progressive content and somewhat itemization.
---
I agree, can we suggest the following to Blizz, make 1.14 later on in the game with TBC class balance while staying in vanilla!
---
Would be a good segue if we progress to TBC much later on
---
Playing around 30 to 50hrs week I hope to be able to do a good amount of raiding and pvp, seeing what you wrote its probably better to re role a different class more then likely. 
---
How hard is it to get 2 different gear sets? Or is it just not gonna happen that and costing 50 gold to re spec.
---
Gold selling is against TOS.  Rolling need on BOE is not.
---
Yes, in any pug I run the loot rules will be clear, and I won't join a pug that has loot rules I don't like.  
---
Exploiting the WSG flag is an exploit.  Rolling need on BOE is not.
---
Heyoo! Wish you were Alliance, we could've partied together.
---
There were also ways to force out a long game by getting the one of the teams to turtle...but patch 2.3 introduced reinforcements, which caused the games to last no more than about 30 minutes regardless of what you do.
---
We can trade, I guess.
---
Hats off to the chill gf’s ! Those who do not necessarily game but appreciate and acknowledge our passion ! (Removes fedora completely)
---
That's awesome. Hope you end up running that guild again!
---
Haha I can tell what you mean. I mentioned it in another comment that I had this experience with someone in a previous guild where I heard the "rest" of her male voice, only slightly, but noticeable.
---
I'm just happy nobody yet complained about my wording thus far. I have said many things people could understand wrong, but I think the tone usually tells what I intend to say. Like "it's hilarious" - not like am laughing at someone, but smiling to myself, because I noticed it.
---
*Most* priests respec shadow at 40/42. It's too mana inefficient to be worth it vs the standard wanding spec starting from lvl 10.
---
5 in imp wand, 5 in spirit tap, rest into holy to get divine fury / searing light.
---
that makes no sense lmao, as if respec costs are what stops people from trying meme builds
---
Mage is top tier DPS and amazing at PVP. Also an amazing leveler. It’s extremely boring in raids. You roll Frost until AQ 40 due to MC and BWL having such high fire resist on mobs or immunities. 
---
Raids typically run 5-8 mages, making gear competition huge. You also pretty much don’t wear tier until Naxx.
---
Thecks
---
Ouais think you can fix most of unbalanced class by numerical adjustments. For example moonkin can be balanced just by reducing the mana cost of spells
---
Me not that kind of Orc.
---
Big agree
---
Yeah, every single gaming community seems to be toxic according to another community. GAF is toxic to ERA, ERA is toxic to GAF, that kinda thing. It makes the whole usage of the word pointless in my eyes because people use it to mean something that is objective when it absolutely is not, it depends what you consider toxic. 
---
Based on your description I could say that person is a killjoy, or a fun-sponge, spoilsport, negative nancy, all sorts of more flavourful and interesting words than "toxic". It's just so dull and tiresome.
---
That's just me, though.
---
I'm all for raiding, did a ton of it for years, but community and interpersonal relationships is what made the game great. And you built a lot of those during your leveling experience, which took months back in vanilla. 
---
People who arent used to it will struggle with how hard it is to even do a dungeon in classic. Just getting everyone there and ready to go can take almost 45 minutes sometimes. Then the dungeon itself can be over an hour depending on which one you're doing.
---
What's your opinion on a casual to a hardcore guild?
---
Is this min maxing eveything and playing only spec that are meta?
---
N-nature's Swiftness..
---
Y I K E S
---
One of my best friends always used Xandur, I like OPs spelling better though. I always go with new names, but my main in classic will be named after my third and final 70 from back then.
---
Do you see the irony in discussing the duality of meaning in the word redundant whilst also complaining about toxic having multiple meanings?
---
I’m not sure but I will say I’ve been watching a lot of shedo the druid videos on youtube and he has a lot of good information. Stat weights and scaling, etc. I’d check his videos out, though he almost entirely plays feral dps spec so keep that in mind if you are playing from a different perspective.
---
They made that jab that if you wanted class balance you should play on retail, and that makes me feel like Bluzzard ingrained in themselves that class balance means no class identity which is definitely disappointing.
---
Yeah I don't mind people stating facts, as long as they're not antagonistic. If your DPS is too low, there's nothing to be gained from not accepting it.
---
I'm going to be trying to be secondary leader for a guild with my friend in classic. Helping people develop for the good of the group seems extremely appealing. Obviously expecting to just have a full raid of seasoned veterans who know everything already is an entirely unrealistic expectation.
---
Okay, give us some concrete examples of what you mean then. So far you haven't offered any substantial arguments yourself, only waved counterarguments aside.
---
Oh great, an orcish princess
---
Great write up man, I was druid main in TBC, but never touched in classic. 
---
Glad to read something factually supporting their 'low-viability' reputation, as opposed to conjecture.
---
If the system is so poorly designed that I can do something you don't like, then maybe time to design a new system?
---
Do you think shadow preist would be viable, I here that they are not wanted either?
---
This is such a bullshit way to get people to buy an extra month of membership for people who canceled untill classic comes out
---
The non-viability of certain specs especially Ret and Prot pallies and feral and balance druids.
---
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Vanilla. But I'm rolling priest specifically because Paladins only have one truly viable spec.
---
Hi Thex, I'm Thëx.
---
Three day long weekend battles on honor release weekend?
---
No, classic crowd and retail crowd
---
6pm EST. So some of us in the minority with jobs actually get a shot a picking a name early? Very cool
---
I don't see the realm I played on either. Whisperwind US. It was a PvE realm.
---
Dude I'm an exclusive gnome player. What's worse then a tiny guy named MrHuggymuffins killing you in pvp?
---
Wowhead Classic's [datamining](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=26656/summon-black-qiraji-battle-tank#used-by-item) says that the cast time is 3 seconds. Interestingly it does not have the flag "Cannot be used while indoors" but that could just be a datamining mistake
---
rip lilith and azrael warlock names
---
Nope. Thats not how it works.
---
I was dead set on mage, then warrior, then priest, then rogue, now I'm bouncing between warlock and druid.
---
Pretty sure those names will be reserved by Blizz before you even have a chance of picking them
---
here in this poll that would not be inconsistent with results.
---
the nost post-mortem was striking in that the avg. respondent age was 22 (3 years ago), and nearly all were between 18-26 or so iirc, yet  a very high % claimed to play classic retail, 11-12 years prior.
---
It's simple for me: If you are going to use the item (equip it) then you roll need. Roll greed for any other purpose.
---
It's quite clear times have changed while reading through the responses though. With the way most people intend to play, they might as well remove the green option entirely. It has no purpose if you roll need on everything you intend to sell because you can literally sell anything in the game.
---
I mean friends say what friends say, right? Like my best friend and I we having our childish and inside insults but also make a kissing noise when sending voice messages or telling us we love each other. We haven't had a single fight since we met (about 12 years now) and I'd wish we would be gay, but sadly both of us are interested in the female physique.
---
What guild/server? At least back it up with something.
---
Thex and the City
---
Or when people stand in fire or the hunter's pet pulls the rest of the instance.
---
They *usually won't but with luck they can
---
Don't Paladins get Judgement pretty early on 1.12?  I started like 2 months after release and at that time I recall having to body pull everything (this was a disaster in Westfall with Murlocs)
---
Hemo rogues will probably just rupture instead, and then kite with crippling poison.
---
This lik is EU, still Zuluhed is not there /confused
---
Not a bad idea. I was thinking they could just tell their goon squads that whoever reserves their name and turns it over to them gets a signed bottle of bath water.
---
IMO anybody can roll need on BOEs for any reason
---
The problem comes when someone actually "need" one item then doesnt get it and as to buy it from the guy that took it for gold.
---
The other thing is If you cant drop a BiS and have to buy it in the AH you need gold so you need on BoE.
---
Havent played before they changed the looting so i dont know how people did back then, looks like a thin line between ninja and "need gets it"
---
The worry of sperg armies, basically.
---
&gt;  If a hybrid can't do the same dps as a pure, their utility needs to be AMAZING to make up for it.
---
No, it just needs to be enough to make up the difference in lost DPS. 
---
&gt; if you ever reach a point where you need that utility because it's too good, you're taking the class, not the player.
---
No one said the utility had to be too good. IMO the utility isn't too good in TBC (except for bloodlust/heroism, which is why I said it needed to be raid wide with sated).

---
You're all trying to be meticulous with the way you play and here I am going to find a stealth cat so I can shadow meld Aimdhoy people
---
At first i hated the gold cost of everything but if im gonna say something today its the lack of gear itemization, like pallies/boomins forced to use cloth gear, how could they not see the limits back then.
---
I'm from EU, I get 15 paid days off a year and I spent 5 of them so I can have a 9 days off using weekends.
---
I don't understand what's so hard to believe about a raid guild doing pvp in their non raid times. You realize that people who ran naxx could ALSO pvp, right?
---
Need to know what the name reservation rules are for deleted characters.
---
Would rather just create a fast character to reserve the name and then be able to delete it and go through real character creation later on without having to rush.
---
I joined the military in 2012. Totally my choice but sometimes the Army takes advantage of me.
---
I was figuring a big drop in 2 but then the final drop not happeneing until after the holidays. Figure folks will have extra time then and we'd see a small spike before everything settles.
---
Because none of us have the time to put in like we did when it first came out. We are gonna grab our warrior WW Axe as early in to 30 as possible. And then just mob around in world PVP Til we are burnt out
---
It was yesterday.  Only name left is Thex.
---
I'm locked in as shaman for my class but I can't decide on race.  I want to pvp so I feel like I'm losing out if I don't go orc but I'm really tempted with Tauren for leeway and warstomp
---
Clearly that achievement, added in Wrath of the Lich King, when WoW had its peak subscribers, is an example of everything wrong with retail WoW. I definitely agree with you, but could you explain a little bit more about why? Because despite agreeing with you completely I don't really understand what I'm agreeing with.
---
There are already nine servers confirmed for EU. The 50 limit has been there default total character limit since forever.
---
Back when I still played, there was always a five-man who stalled at the towers, usually a pair of DKs, a Rogue, a Hunter, and a Shaman.
---
Biased! Alliance part is bigger.
---
No, "private servers" aren't an all-encompassing unity.
---
A certain popular realm starting with the letter N has been using the pre-1.12 AV - as has many others.
---
He doesnt need that many accounts, just $servercount other people that equally hate streamers.
---
The organization compensates me well with pay and 2 days of leave a month earned. The healthcare and a four day at least once a month helps as well even though I sometimes come in during the four day.
---
From what I remember when people would blast techno on vent it was more
---
tss tss tss tss x 1 minute
---
next minute is slowing adding an extra beat every 30 seconds
---
about at the 3 minute mark a woman says a small meaningless phrase, then the song gets more intense
---
Yes it was called Comix. I liked that it had a feature for counting your jumps. I remember as a mage it say, "Stay Frosty" when you ice blocked. Also pretty sure it said Finish him at 20% for the warriors execute. When rogues would sprint it would do the speedy gonzales andale andale yee haw. Battle Shouts were the Godzilla roar. Also gave comic onomatopoeia graphics when anything happened.
---
Fairest way: everyone gets to roll on the super valuable item.
---
I'm done commenting for real now.
---
but classic will require a sub, so technically they are also retail?
---
You have to understand, it's not necessarily the streamer that sucks... it's the following that comes with it. Streamers attract that Twitch crowd which, imo, are toxic and horrible to deal with. They also blindly worship streamers to the point that any and everything they would need would be handed to them.
---
Like, Soda was trying to create a black list of people who ganked him. On a PvP server. It's extremely silly and a heard of followers would instantly hunt down anyone and corpse camp them for ages. On top of that should the streamer grow bored with the game, once they leave their followers go with them. Populations would be unstable and fickle all due to one person.
---
It's just a lot that people justifiably want to avoid. I want to play Classic WoW, not worry about what Asmon/Soda is up to or if I ganked the wrong person.
---
Letting the Warrior get one Charge in for free (and the following attacks) would put you at a huge disadvantage and be quite unfair for a supposedly "fair" 1v1 duel.
---
A decent warrior will still be able to get his charge off in most duels.
---
Except he's not right tho he made a blanket statement that's incorrect
---
&gt;It created the genre. 
---
Maybe if you were born in 2000.   
---
If not, then no it didn't.

I know right? I got downvoted to hell for saying the same thing.
---
Hey man, you do you. No judgement, whatever you find fun!
---
Is there one for mages ?
---
Be content and peaceful in your blissful ignorance.
---
Have you got anything to restock food/water/ammunition?
---
Hey, I bet that a lot of people playing at launch are going to be people who never played vanilla and want to see what's up, if you're toxic, they'll leave, and the game will die without new players coming in. I mean, it will eventually stagnate and die if it never updates, but a toxic playerbase can kill a game WAY faster by making it impossible to get into the game.
---
&gt; Would rather just create a fast character to reserve the name and then be able to delete it and go through real character creation later on without having to rush.
---
Regardless of the ruleset they use (old vanilla versus current retail, mix of both, whatever), you should be doing exactly this anyways.
---
A druid earns every kill, every fight/skirmish feels like one person out played the other. Hunter's are a tough match up, but even losing to one after many minutes of you two playing this weird range game with each other is one of the most satisfying things you can feel imo you feel like you lost a good fight. Even in BGs (besides WSG carrier) the utility you can provide to a team fight just by understanding your capabilities, waiting patiently to come out of stealth or holding on to your cds is one of the most rewarding things ever.
---
Vanilla is known for having short and bursty pvp matches, often with rng like resistances or crits playing a huge roll. A Druid flatlines that more than anyone else (besides maybe a pally) into a long and thought out fight. I never would have imagined I'd have so much fun playing druid and *learning* to play druid as I ever have

---
You hit something OTHER than frostbolt?!  BENCHED!
---
People are impossibly dense on this sub. It's sad. I'm having people argue that because there are specs that are good in 1v1 duels that the classes are balanced.
---
oh cool! thanks.
---
&gt;No, it just needs to be enough to make up the difference in lost DPS
---
Yes, because how do you quantify that? Sure a feral druid could brez but if you never use it, he's useless. Not all utility was in the form of raw dps boosts. 
---
&gt;  IMO the utility isn't too good in TBC 
---
Which just strengthens my position that TBC was still kind of bad for hybrids. WOTLK was MUCH better for anyone who didn't play one of the four pure classes. 
---
&gt; If hybrids did the same dps as pure, why would you bring the class with no utility? 
---
Easy. By giving some of the pure classes some utility of their own.
---
not sure tax is the right word in classic.  your dps is laughably bad.

\*shrugs in priest\*
---
You don't have to if you don't want to. Honestly I'd rather they lock it behind a paywall so people don't make 50 accounts to reserve every name on every server 10 seconds after the reservation period starts
---
The whole thing seems a lil silly, doesn't it?
---
Every healer has an off heal spec that's viable to do content outside of Raids in.
---
True but I will probably end up with some weird combo of one handers during the year(s) leading up to Naxx at some point, especially if hamstring spam won't be as effective as on pservers
---
I think it would be okay to level with. Just slower than shadow only since you won't get shadow form. The trade-off is that you can heal yourself better.
---
Until level 20 you smite and wand things to death. Priest leveling picks up at 20 with mind flay and starts getting a lot better with shadowform at 40. 
---
With this meme build I would go into wand specialization until 20, Respec and get mind flay. Then from there get vamp embrace then go into holy.
---

really? I could have sworn that it will be an optional choice to have nochanges graphics or graphics that more relate to retail. not 1:1 exactly. Maybe it was character models? idk.

I know ive seen a post where they showed 2 different versions of the classic graphical experience. one was as normal as vanilla gets but the other seemed to have much more foliage.

I feel the same with wanting them to re release expansions but differently. It's sort of weird asking the devs to do that but I think if they learn from past mistakes and keep the game CHALLENGING it will keep enough players to keep it profitable. Personally it was lvl scaling, account wide mounts and the abilty to wear item sets you werent actually equipped with that turned me completely off to WoW and other MMOs (Elder Scrolls Online is the only other one I know that does all that).

I guess bliz saw that the Horde was winning some AV matches and needed to revert to the old map that fucks them more.
---
Agreed :P
---
Tanks have the highest demand, followed by healers, follows by mages and warlocks as cloth DPS with simple CC, followed by rogues for sap, followed by hunters, and then DPS only warriors and the meme specs.  
---
Hunters may get a higher priority this time around if CC takes a back seat to just killing things quickly, but they’re not really in demand because they have a bad reputation for not being able to control their pets and breaking CCs with multishot.  Even Freezing trap isn’t that desirable because it can’t be reapplied, which means the enemy will head straight to you or the healer, and you will just FD.  
---
The one exception is that every UBRS run will want a hunter for Drak kiting.
---
Well the problem is my decision required me to accept I will have 2 level 60 characters on different servers and factions...
---
except that it won't be there in Classic (unless there will)

Och! Yer finally awake, laddy!
---
The nicest thing is that it just gives you more freedom.
---
There's a lot of things you can do for gold (farm, play the market, etc.) but since they aren't "have to do so much of it every day", it just gives you more freedom to do things that aren't profitable without feeling like you're missing out.
---
Instead of feeling like "oh I shouldn't work on my alt until my main's dailies are done." It's just asking yourself what you want to do most.
---
Aspect of the pack in a raid.
---
So you're saying ten million and one including your brother in law?
---
Because no one killed it with 4 tanks until level 70 in TBC.
---
I missed the boat when the game was released as I was in the military. Never played until my bud turned me on to a vanilla server last month. I’m absolutely hooked now and have 3 level 20+ characters in anticipation of finding my main for when classic drops.
---
Everyone knows humans have no honor. It's just humans don't go around screaming about their honor.
---
Wrath was the edge of the cliff IMHO.  Achievements like that one became incentives to play a certain way.  In this case, playing a battleground in the complete opposite way that it was legendary for being played.  Group finder made finding a group a cake walk, but the groups were terrible.
---
Your own words are telling.  That was the games peak, right before these things became the norm.  Then it declined.  I myself wanted no part of Cata.

I think you meant epic flying, your first flying mount was the 60% speed one. I remember people were 70 with flying maybe 24 hours after the pack dropped.
---
its not horde's fault alliance rolled on pvp server
---
Any interest in weekend raid times? Say/ sun 12-3pm? If so we can chat.
---
Not really talking about profits or revenue or anything, just strictly population.
---
I would be VERY surprised if Classic had over 1 million active players, 3-4 months in.
---
HEY! Give him his macro back!
---
When I came back in legion I played a tank and actually thought they took daze out of the game. It wasn't until months into the expansion that I was informed about tanks being immune to it.
---
It's the same time as launch, so midnight CET.
---
It's as simple as: boe blue drops, you say in chat EVERYONE NEED. Everyone needs, no ninjas, everyone's happy. If someone wants it to use, they ask the winner for it and it's up to them to be nice or not.
---
It’s called enhanced interrogation
---
Ohh ok. I was a resto druid back then. Combat rogue on pservers though.
---
I remember on ours people would let alliance take snowfall (I think that's the one off to the side near field of strike) to prevent each zerg from clashing. We would make it a point to hold that graveyard and prevent that from happening. People would give us so much shit for it.
---
THIS. Holy shit that is so annoying. It’s fucking VC if you gotta cheese him just kys
---
I don't see how that's more applicable to retail than to classic. Particularly because in retail warlocks have other mechanics that get used in PvE combat, and in classic you just spam shadowbolt. Same with mages/frostbolt. In PvP they're also just entirely different so... ya you were hoping no one would challenge you and you'd just get free upvotes for hating on retail?
---
they are more likely to get on over a weekend, say Friday night to Sunday morning, almost everyone would manage friday, week day workers would be able to play, weekend workers would be able to play.
---
Is it really that big of a difference? I havent played classic in any iteration so this melee leeway and tauren (female too or male only) extra melee range is a little confusing.
---
Well done plus (charred) with ketchup
---
Thanks for the names so far, gives us somewhere to start
---
Ret's peak is WOTLK imo, any version past WOTLK has been worse and worse: someday we will get unique classes/specs once again, until then it's just rogue in different colors.
---
&gt; also epic mounts are a) not flying and b) totally usable in AV I have no clue what you're talking about
---
Link was to EU.  You might need US link.

Ehh, TBC wasn't perfect.  I mean it depends on what you think balance should look like.. resto druids were OP for arena in TBC.  People would be mad if that was never changed.. but once you do the calculus of 'fixing' the issues with arena, over time you end up with the stale 'everyone is the same' problem with class design we have today.

Any interest in weekend raids? We fit all your criteria besides time. Sat / sun 12-3pm est.
---
and you decide that for every player..? nice.
---
The only way druids are doing considerable burst is abusing their high crit %,opening with Starfire. This would lead to nature's grace making wrath a global cool down cast, and reducing it further isn't going to up your DPS. 
---
The same can't be said for mages / shamans due to cast times and no nature's grace.
---
21 points in nature for a slightly faster 1-of wrath is going to be a net loss in dps.
---
If nature's swiftness could cast Starfire, then that'd be something.
---
No need to get so defensive, man. 
---
I got my answer, even if it was indirect.

THANK YOU!!

It was hard to find amidst all the necessary stuff stemming from moderation work, but I got what I was looking for.

If the end product turns out to be something post-worthy, I will put it up here and give credit to you by name \o/
---
Fun group of people!  Very knowledgeable on classic
---
I think it’s time for a new round of bingo.
---
Yes, but at least I can unleash Infernals in the Crossroads.
---
Gray's on being a rebel, I guess? Not sure what that has to do with flying mounts.
---
Does this mean you'll be able to reserve the 3 names/characters without actually selecting a realm?
---
I'm not sure what these absolutes your dealing in are. Most people don't need the handful of gold vendor value that would be a potential item upgrade for someone. Most everyone will need a potential instant 500-1000g.
---
just let the entire wave of min maxxers that want 4 day /played level 60s to go by
---
I'll be farming mounts until classic comes out
---
This is what I am in favor of as well. People respeccing on the fly is what retail is now. You need a different setup for a certain situation? Just go to talents and switch em over.  
---
I want people to have to return to town and wait for a long period to respec.  
---
Personally I don't want it at all for classic wow, cause - this is a recreation of vanilla. But if Blizzard decided to add dualspec to classic, I'd accept it if it had this restriction.
---
No Chipotle in Sweden though.
---
But I just love spicy taco maaaan.
---
Imp devo aura is garbage, total crappola. 
---
Redoubt is a much better talent for tanking especially while leveling.  Paladins kind of *want* to get crit occasionally which is wierd.  But devo aura is crap, still.  That extra armor helps you less and less as you get more armor from gear, so it scales inversely!  Each point of toughness is a better benefit to you, and your allies will always benefit from some other aura other than Devo.  So please don't think I meant to endorse Devo aura as a talent choice =P
---
As a main tank in 5 man/10 man I would think you'd be rocking either a resist aura or ret aura for extra threat.  
---
It's tough because improved RF is a higher tier than any of the others, so once you get there you have to choose between them.  Improved RF is essential for tanking as you said, but completely useless in PVP.  At least shield spec or toughness do allow for some damage mitigation. 
---
That's how I like it though, my paladin is completely PVP focused and I never tank.  I never farm with him.  If I'm doing PVE, I'm healing.  So I can safely discard improved RF and feel good about it.
---
Bam mod.. 
---
Would go “bam!” every time you crit.  Was funny for about 5 mins
---
I was extremely close with pretty much every guildmate I had in tbc and wrath. But when I think back on my vanilla experience there were maybe fewer than five guildmates that I would have considered a friend at the time. I like how you could actually chat in vent with 25 people in a raid without being overwhelmed by chatter, but in vanilla it was pretty strict with the no talking unless you really had to since there were just too many people.
---
I mentioned that in my more detailed response below. But thanks anyway for pointing it out...it can't be said often enough how important communication is in classic !
---
PvP gear outclasses a lot of pve gear early on. Just because you think raiding is the endgame doesnt mean it has to be for everyone else. A huge portion of the playerbase prefers 5 man content, and the class balance there is nothing like raiding. Honestly you're just ignorant.. but it is what it is.   
---
Class balance was at a highpoint in Vanilla. Its by far the most balanced era of the game.
---
I really hope this includes time zones.
---
\-I'll be using the gold that's been sitting on my account for years to buy time so yeah why not.
---
\-I doubt it'll be taken, I generally go for unique names that are at least medium length.
---
\-I have, though that's not what I'm doing this time.
---
&gt; God, scaling mobs is such dumb design.
---
Everyone hated in in Oblivion, it's one of the worst aspects of the game.. then Blizzard is like "let's copy this terrible idea everyone hates!"  Baffling.
---
You are most welcome. Beep boop.
---
Yes, I do actually. One spec is good at 1v1, another at raw patchwerk dps. That is good balance. Inequality is the only way to achieve true balance.   
---
Class balance in wow has never been better than in vanilla, where every spec is useful and excels at something.
---
Yeah, this is how AV was on the p server I played on. If it was a premade, alliance could win in 4-5 minutes. if it was a pug, alliance would just not try while horde took the backdoor and won. 
---
There was a solid spot where I could put down a trap then fd/trap again and entrap a ton of people, but there weren't a ton of archers to take people out. With a mage there, also, we could take out several, or if we had a goblin shredder we could sometimes wipe the horde there.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I remember there being an add on called "tank score" or "tank points" or something like that in vanilla, which was essentially the equivalent of gearscore for tanks.
---
There will be some sort of mechanism for ranking gear and assigning points, it'll inevitably happen regardless of the armory being in/out.
---
Love the screenshot, OP!  
---
You can tell he's chomping at the bit to get behind you.

If you are gonna refuse to play as a priest play another class

How young are you that having bills and student loans and rent and supporting someone besides yourself are no factors in your life?
---
Cool, glad my posts helped. Good luck with your project.
---
Please don't take the name Thex. I plan to use it.
---
I think that was one of the strats as well that I forgot about.  People either sat in Galv keep or at Snowfall and wipe the Alliance to trigger a turtle match. There were several players who got super pissed when we did that.
---
Heck, a warrior one would be nice as well :)
---
Frozen Runes, Cloth/Leather/Mail/Plate scraps that were needed for tier 3 turn ins.
---
Been using the same name since I was like 11yrs old and variations of it.
---
No, its just that you cant fill up every real with 3 characters
---
They don't communicate in retail. Not in a lvl 43 dungeon, not in a mythic+10.
---
They don't because its not necessary. Tools find your group for you. Websites vet player skill for you. Tactics and metas are agreed upon. No one has to travel as autoports and super-fast world travel options are abundant.
---
Turning your post around:  
---
Just because you said *"hi"* in your Group-Finder BRD run, and one guy out of 4 replied *"hey"*, doesn't mean people communicate in retail.
---
And I think it will, but that is something we will never know.
---
They still don't mention what the server cap would be though
---
I don't think it's clear at all that the game was balanced around raiding. I think the design of the classes makes it pretty clear they were designed around dungeons and overworld stuff. I think that's one of the distinguishing features of Vanilla, that raiding and raid balance was kind of an after thought, and it's only with TBC that you really get a systematic approach to balancing builds around raiding.
---
For the longest time, there were Trance songs in my head that I could just not find anywhere. I had no clue how to search for them or remember any words.
---
They are all on your list and you have made me so happy now! Thank you random internet stranger.
---
Lol you're the defensive and jealous one. I said pvp was boring because all I did was roll into pugs and stomp them to death repeatedly. You got jealous because you played an enh shaman at the time and just got kited to death 24/7 so you took it out on me. No big deal.
---
I know you all hate twitch and stuff, but [yes.](https://clips.twitch.tv/BitterDarkWrenchJKanStyle)
---
I'm one that you envy lol I'm maining mage and duo leveling warrior with my friend 
---
I'm settled on those an I'm not swapping out! But I might make a druid and a lock just to have alts and see what they were like back in low levels, I leveled in wrath so I saw some of it but I'm really looking forward to seeing how all the classes played back in the day (and it's not classic wow without a bunch of random level alts) :P
---
Read the fucking comments?
---
Yea i think trolls got them from the loas, dwarves and humans from the light and nightelves from elune.
---
Dont know about undeads tho.
---
I will attend both...
---
Do you want everyone to answer or..? Maybe create a poll or something instead
---
If they got rid of all the catering. Making you actually work for stuff instead of handouts and such I'd be in, I personally think some minds might change during the success of vanilla but time will tell. Either way excited to see the nostalgia train coming to town, I will just be enjoying the ride.
---
To eat my words I'll give the first 1-15 portion of your guide a try come Thursday.
---
Oh god. Let me out.
---
i think the test is at like, noon?  yeah definitely be asleep
---
Power progression is just much more noticable in Classic. When you get a bit more spell power as a mage, you notice it. When I got my 2 BiS trinkets during the Uldir tier (titanforged, socketed and everything) it was barely noticable. 
---
This is what makes Vanilla grinding preferable to me.
---
Priest can clear 50ish gold/h in DM. If you know what to farm you can get much more
---
This is a test for Euro logins primarily.
---
Balance in tbc was only modestly better
---
&gt;Hopefully it does well enough that we will get the option to migrate to TBC classic servers.
---
My body is so ready.
---
you know what, i don't think i ever got this thing lol.
---
I'm guessing a whole lot of people. Everyone I know personally will not be logging in nor give a shit to. Idk why they would launch it on a weekday. I won't even be subbing until August 30th when I can't actually play.
---
World buffs can die in a fire.
---
That's what the paradox is, genius. Think about what you wrote.
---
Why is an item so valuable if it's never worth equipping? Who is buying it and for what purpose if they aren't going to equip it? Of course they are equipping it. You've decided the gold is more valuable *to you* than the temporary power increase, but if that was the only mindset then no one would buy it and it's value would tank.
---
What you've actually done is assigned a threshold to when greed justifies a change in behavior. Someone could simply have a lower threshold and use the exact same justification to need on everything only to vendor it. So what is your threshold? 10g? 50g? 100g? 500g? What's the value where greed justifies rolling need on an item to sell when you otherwise wouldn't (or would you say it's acceptable to roll need on BOP items to vendor too)?
---
Good post
---
Something that has put my "main" class into question for this first phase is if I should keep with the prot warrior or change to main a mage for the first phase simply because of how fun it is to make ports to different places so people get tp'd to some place they didnt want to go to
---
No because it would have to reserve those names on all servers to make your reservation work. It needs to know which server you want.
---
No. It means you can reserve three total characters across all realms. So you can do three on one realm, or one each on three realms, or two on one realm and one on another.
---
The times they proposed for folks to be on to test the stressing I'll be at work.  I'll be on during the stress test just not the initial hours they wanted people to log in.  Thought it was weird to end it by 4pm EST in regards to the login test (not the overall stress test).
---
&gt; Most people don't need the handful of gold vendor value that would be a potential item upgrade for someone. Most everyone will need a potential instant 500-1000g.
---
Who decides who most is? What if you're not in the most? 
---
Also at what point doe the handful add up to the potential for the other given that they have different drop rates?
---
Iamthex
---
In such nice condition too!
---
Most people have jobs
---
Druids peak in pre raid bis (when others have this) and then again with ZG / AQ mix 
---
(Speaking of balance hybrids specifically, unsure of fetal)
---
From what I hear, after AQ and going into Naxx, warlocks, mages, rogues and warriors all go way way up in damage whereas druids and other classes only increase marginally.
---
Maybe controversial but I prefer the way vanilla specs work. Making a choice is a big commitment- you're supposed to play 1 character in 1 single way at a time.  
---
I think the actual problems are guilds demanding their players to fill multiple roles and those same players wanting to do both pve and pvp with perfect builds.  
---
Also, resto specs, to a lesser degree. Specifically, their world grind speeds.
---
I see, I guess I'm anywhere on showing the usually pve raids take in classic. I thought must of the time I would have to play the much to make sure I have flask,potions, gear etc.
---
Yeah, lol. Most of my douchebaggery was for the opposing faction, but I never felt bad about pissing off people in AV who bitch at people for actually trying.
---
No one knows for sure but I think it's highly likely this will be in-client.
---
What do you mean? We're getting the names this week by Friday and next week is the reservation.  
---
If I have to guess we will be able to log in the character selection screen next week to be able to choose our realms and reserve our names. The names are unique for the realm yes, but we will be picking a realm by the time comes for reservation.
---
Very easy to have this cynical view. It's also going to be incredibly useful for them to gauge number of players actually planning on launch, and help mitigate issues on launch day.
---
I think you're vastly overestimating the impact the pserv "culture" will have on Classic servers. Were talking a very small number of people, on any given server. 
---
We'll see what happens. But you're just assuming that will automatically carry over to Classic, which I think is a very large assumption.
---
N-dale is definitely not using the 1.5 AV.  There's no mountain path, the GY spawns are like 50 yards away from the caps, there are way more guards and no elites on the graveyards, it has the 1.11 NPC population and the NPCs are doing their 1.8-changed damage levels.  In a nutshell, N-dale AV is literally the 1.12 AV.
---
I think your chances of finding a guild letting you play shadow in raids are much higher than finding a guild letting you play elemental shaman. Shadow Priest is not optimal in raids but they are much more accepted.
---
Did you ever just sit there in Ventrilo, playing DotA? You’d be pushing and you’d be owning
---
I'll agree with this. It's a counter-fun game system.
---
How did you arrange the brackets for your guild rankings?
---
You grind rep on retail in order to get flying though. For the most part. And you get flying in the middle of the expansion. So your point here is - kind of - invalid, because by the time you get flying, you are done with rep grind for that... and rep grind in each new zone that is added later - vide Argus or zones that are added now in BfA - is done without flying too... 'cause you can't fly in those zones. Grind in retail is a problem because of different reason. It's unlimited. You are never done with your character, you always have to grind for AP, Gear that you already obtained... but it can forge and will be better! Or new raid came out and you have to re-grind gear you already have for guaranteed higher ilvl. The fact that you are never done with grind is a problem. It is not a thing in classic though because you don't have titanforging and all the crazy stuff that happens in gear. Yeah, sure you farm gear but when you have it - you have it, you are done with grind. In retail you are not.
---
Forthright in meaning more similar to situation 1. Just I make no attempt to hide it but I'm certainly not flamboyant or pushy about it. 
---
Safer is indeed a hard word. I think that online culture can have real life consequences. If someone is bullied or called names I don't think it matters if it happens online or in person. It's not like someone goes out and chooses their sexuality and if they are often encountering people who use their sexuality as an insult or to describe something negative I think that has real consequences for their state of mind. And I just don't think that a guild that allows that kind of language fosters a positive environment. You never know what someone is going through on their side of the screen. That's all I meant. I do know from personal encounters that there are lots of people who come to online games as an escape for their realities and I worry that if they were to happen into another environment that marginalized them what that would result in.
---
Something I hated and simultaneously miss is just how much the game hated you, and how it wasn't scared to let you know it
---
Yes!! I remember having this in my computer and watching the life out of it. Darn you RedSword...
---
I'm sad these aren't the same look and function as the old Vanilla forums. The new forums are such a pain in the ass to navigate and use.
---
I've stayed off them for as long as they were changed.
---
Hint: the coast is never clear. Lok'tar ogar!
---
i wish they'd use the same layout of the old forums just for the classic section
---
You heard it here first folks. You are good at dueling and 1 boss in NAXX. We've achieved balance.
---
I remember from pserver hitting level 10 was more enjoyable and exciting then 110 on retail.  At least between 110-120 there is a small sense of progression only cause you're completing the chapters of each zone.  Even then I found the level 10 ding in Vanilla felt more impactful.

---
Combo points stacking on the target.
---
Not true, if you were defense cap against the mob attacking you, you couldn't be dazed.
---
So what do you think good balance is then? For every spec to deal exactly the same damage with equal gear? For all healers too do just as much healing? Sounds awfully boring to me.
---
He could also hope it's still available on the rest of the servers on the 27th. Not guaranteed, but I'm sure some good names will still be available on launch day. Of course after launch day they vanish fast, because people will be name camping with their 50 characters.
---
Honestly I was more excited about this prospect than anything else when Blizzard announced Classic.
---
Thank you! I was thinking the same.
---
How did *I* arrange brackets? I didn't. I was simply a filler who joined the pvp group when I was bored. I didn't manage honor or who got it.
---
I like it. I want to play a RPG.
---
Hmmm... Here's my response to your three points:
---
* Gold grind: Well someone else mentioned 5 mans, and that seems to make sense. Personally, I never really "farmed" gold. I had 90g at 40 for my mount -- mainly by selling pretty much all my greens on the AH as I leveled. Always got a bit more money than I would've vendoring the stuff. I never really understood how I could sell my greens for more than the vendor, but I always suspected it had to do with people leveling enchanting and buying (still cheap) greens to disenchant into mats. I'll definitely be trying this out again this time around, and see if I can still sell the greens, or if that theory still holds true. For 60, I got my mount a few days after 60, but recognize I was lucky as I won a roll for [Shifting Cloak](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shifting_Cloak) in a DM Tribute Run, which gave me 300g. Still I had 600g at 60 without any particular grinding. Also, at 60, I pretty much transmuted essences/arcanite bars as I had herb/alchemy (including while leveling). Not the best in terms of money maker, but I didn't spend much on alchemy, and made money easily without really grinding mats (just buying off AH). But yeah, the DM Tribute is a good example of making money from 5 mans at 60 (though I recognize this ain't the best strat, mainly was just lazy to actually do some gold grinding). Another example is Greater Fire Prot Potion recipe which drops in LBRS, worth another 250-300g and it can drop for anybody at anytime, just depends on your luck!
---
* Respecs: Well, I think you'll have to accept whether you're playing Shadow or you're not. I didn't have that much interest in shadow, cuz I was mainly a PvE Priest (so healing end-game), and I was happy with for the aforementioned reasons (that if you like healing, healing as a priest at 60 (and before) I always felt was satisfying). I was mainly Disc (cuz it gives you the most mana to work with) with some Holy of course, so I could do decent in BGs and stuff, healing or doing *some* damage (but nothing like shadow priest, of course). Also, never really remembered losing many duels as disc, as I always had enough to fear (psychic scream) and regen enough mana to keep myself alive. You'll have *some* room to experiment with specs (as early respec costs aren't too steep), but I think you do kinda have to decide what spec/gameplay you'll expect at 60 (heal or shadow) since switching back and forth often ain't really viable (unless you've got loads of money).
---
* Playing on your own: Well, it's doable, but yeah, it's probably a bit less fun than if you're a most damage dealing class (I alted a 60 rogue, and I'd say that's a fair assessment), but still doable, in BG or grinding/getting mats in the open world. But again, as someone else said here, 60 (healing) priest is pretty much about group play; it's where I think the class was most fun to play (that's what healing is), and again, you feel very valued since you're *the* healer (unless shadow specced, which is a whole other story, of course).
---
But I just want to make or reiterate a certain point. I **loved** healing in Vanilla, so priest was awesome for that. The point I want to make is especially that I think what works so well for priests healing in terms of fun and group dynamics is that when people look for others for a group/raid, you're role is just unambiguous, so everyone is happy to get a priest in a group if looking for a healer (and people always look for a healer, of course!). Pallies, druids, (and I suspect shamans) etc... are just a bit more ambiguous I think in this regard, so their roles as healers are a bit less valued. I don't mean to offend, but I think that's just how people perceive classes. Also, that doesn't make pallies, druids, etc. lesser healers if they really want to heal, just that they're not as valued at the get go. Also, as a priest, you have a wonderful and complete arsenal/toolkit of healing spells, which makes the class dynamic and fun. Group healing, HoTs, fast/slow heals, etc. depending on the situation... so that also I think really helps to make the class more valuable, both for you as a player (fun), and for others grouping with you (value you for your unambiguous and *good* role as a main healer).
---
Sorry for the long post... Don't mean to offend anyone, but this is my experience maining priest at 60 in Vanilla. Things may have changed since Vanilla, which may alter the experience of priests in today's meta, but I don't think some core things will have changed (perhaps just the priest pop might be a bit higher today, but I don't think that should matter too much!). If you choose something else than priest, that's ok too! Good luck in your choices and encounters!
---
Tbf, alliance was terrible back then. They had to give them one bg to win!
---
Is that THEX on the thumbnail?
---
STV is definitely more populated, but if you want to just go be a huge dick, camping Redridge as a high level Horde is an endless supply of level 20's.
---
More specifically, this gif references a private server guild &lt;Pirates of the Pancreas&gt; and one of the members Whitegrape, who have basically spent the last few years camping Redridge on the largest Vanilla private server. All fucking day, every day.
---
I use to spam my auto attack button, not realizing the 'AUTO' part 🙄
---
BGs will be cross realm, as they patched that in for 1.12.
---
I'm always impressed by Reddit's ability to take something marginally comical and, in a matter of days, run it straight into the ground.
---
Priest Shackle!
---
It's common joke about Warcraft players.... Relax dude.
---
You've had a year to book a day off.
---
If you don't need gold you can roll greed I suppose, turns out most people do though 😛
---
Hoenstly probably somewhere in the realm of 100+. You can be a nihilist and say you always need gold and need every item, but it turns out the loot system is more nuanced than that and it won't make you any friends
---
The editing on this is solid, well done.
---
I think they re-added PVP titles in like WOD or something, which was cool.
---
How likely is it to sell for 500g within the majority of phase 1? I think highly unlikely on most servers. But it'll still sell for plenty , comparitively
---
Vi sitter har i venten och spielar lite dota
---
Wait, they got rid of Druid's water travel form at some point?
---
&gt; Yes, because how do you quantify that? 
---
By...quantifying it? I think we're having a breakdown here. I'm talking about the utility brought by boosting the DPS of the pures with stuff like windfury totem, which is definitely quantifiable.
---
&gt; Which just strengthens my position that TBC was still kind of bad for hybrids.
---
You misunderstand me. I wasn't saying "I don't think utility was very good in TBC," I was saying "I don't think the ulility in TBC is overly good, to the extent to which you were referring in your post." Context. 
---
&gt; Easy. By giving some of the pure classes some utility of their own.
---
Like I said, you wind up with very homogenous classes like you saw past cata
---
Balance was a decent pvp caster spec. Like a mage, it's strong against melee. Plus you can sneak around in kitty until you are ready to bomb starfires on someone
---
So an 80s action one-liners addon.  Love it!
---
None of these things are necessarily things that were removed. But things that made them unique. In retail there’s a billion things that makes you fast underwater. There’s even a fishing poll you can equip during combat to insta switch you to an extremely fast shark thing
---
Is it autistic now?
---
Done
---
Karazhan was in the Eastern kingdoms.  Stormwind was still the main city
---
I'm glad WoW didn't exist until I was out of college.
---
Guild levels and perks were cata. I wasnt a big fan as it made it much harder to start up a new guild, most people would join level 25 guilds for the perks.
---
When I last played (pre-naxx patch), N-dale definitely had Korrak, shredders, mine layers, and all the other 1.5 goodies. Those were removed before 1.11 in vanilla.
---
I don't know if anything changed with recent patches.
---
Will be rolling hunter because:
---
1.I have always hated leveling so hunter is pretty much best bet on that department.
---
2.Really like soloing stuff/ 2 manning dungeons etc. 
---
3.Easy farming
---
4.I plan on playing hardcore for month and then go really casual. When everyone has bad gear at the start, hunter should pretty much decimate every other dps class.
---
[5.](https://5.One) Had all classes max leveled on retail when I still played, but hunter/shaman are the only ones I never played seriously. 
---
6.Easy to learn, hard to master is the kind of stuff I like :)
---
I really hope they publish faction balance data before launch.
---
My guess would be it's just like creating your character now, but the login / character creation server isn't connected to the game server. So it wouldn't send you forward into the game. The play button might be disabled, which is an easy flag to set on their end.
---
Sad times my friend. But I can relate to your love of spicy tacos. Make a journey to my home of Southern California to get your spicy taco fix.
---
Warrior to warlock to warrior to mage to warrior to rogue to warrior to mage to warrior to priest to warrior to shaman to warrior to warlock to warrior to priest to warrior.
---
I keep doing it too, but one keeps coming back.  We will see what I do at launch.
---
Undead players can’t be shackled, they’re technically humanoid
---
Most tier sets are geared towards hybrid dps and have sett bonuses that help healing making them garbage in pve and good in pvp. And t2,5 is a straight elemental sett and bis for elemental.
---
I agree when it comes to something like fire vs. frost. A mage can get by doing everything with either spec. Sucks a lot more for warriors who want to tank a dungeon but also want to be able to quest on their own.
---
I did exactly this 😂😂😂
---
Just buy meal replacement milkshakes if you want to full poop-sock classic release. Make sure you chase that with a fiber supplement or those are going to be some horrific socks.
---
People who don't understand this are going to be the boomer equivalent to future generations as boomers are to us now.
---
And so the cycle continues.
---
That undead girl was such a qt
---
The word toxic is toxic, and bitchy as hell. Keep that new-era, wimpy nonsense out of my Classic. YOU are the people I don't want anything to do with, not the newbies.
---
I would love to some day. Swedish taco is very different from your kind, at least according to the Texans I met and offered tacos to, man were they disappointed.
---
Was wondering if any organized guilds were going to roll PST.  Seems like all of them are CST or EST.
---
Yeah disc 5 could get it.
---
On my server, the same AV game would be going on for multiple days. Gotta go to work/school? That’s fine. Just come back and pick up where you left off!
---
Pink rogues with bubble instead of stealth lol
---
According to the other survey, most people &gt;50% doesn't have an active sub, and I doubt most of those people will buy a sub for nothing.
---
Yes they have judgement at like level 4 or 6 or something. But its only like a 10 yard cast so you're basically body pulling at that point. Good luck in Westfall trying to pull just one Defias Pillager on your own lol
---
lol I got the meal replacement shakes covered...
---
To get classic players to log on and pad retails numbers?
---
Who hurt you?
---
If the group agrees, sure. Simply saying it chat when the roll pops up isn't sufficient to me unless everyone agrees. I certainly prefer a different approach. If I'm on my mage and Foror's Compendium drops, my default action is to allow the warrior to have it. If he says otherwise then no problem.
---
But look I'm under no delusions of the world. If this is how the community decides to play it, then we all suffer and I will just be disappointed and concede. I just hope to play with a more trusting and less greedy community if possible.
---
I thought that spells for my paladin would automatically update rank on my hotbar when I bought them. I got pretty far before realizing I was still using rank 1 spells and had to swap them out.
---
Sorry, but its not that simple.
---
&gt;  If a dps places damage on the wrong target they will take agro and start to receive substantial damage. If they die or drop threat it goes back to the tank
---
That works on paper. In practice, said mob may be a [Firebrand Invoker](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Firebrand_Invoker) in LBRS who then detonates his Fire Nova spell right in the group before walking back to you. Or a [Scarshield Legionnaire](Scarshield Legionnaire) who will, on his way back to you, shield bash the Healer (no, the healer doesn't need to have aggro for this to happen), silencing him in a crucial moment, and wiping you.
---
Not every mob is a super-simple "hits stuff in melee range only" kind of mob.
---
And even simple melees will cause problems: The amount of aggro you need to have over a tank to pull aggro off him, depends on whether you are in melee range of the mob (10% over) or not (30% over). If the mob wanders off, he may get close to a, say Warlock, whos on 120%...and suddenly, he becomes the target, because hes now in melee range. And instead of coming back to you, the mob will start murdering your group. Until you realize that something has gone horribly wrong, you are already down 2 people, and the wipe is imminent.
---
So, let's say I am this Warlock, who did nothing wrong, but died, and had to do a Thorium-Point to LBRS corpserun, because you didn't want to taunt a mob, to "educate" a hunter who misplayed.
---
Do you think I will blame just the hunter for that?
---
word toxic did not exist back then delete this
---
Also Ravenholdt manor for rogues.
---
&gt;  Idk why they would launch it on a weekday.
---
Because that's when they work lol
---
This is a really cool idea!
---
I can't WAIT for the Warlock one. I think they received the biggest relative improvement of any class. They went from easily the worst in PvP ("warlocks... are mushrooms") to one of the best in the game with the deathcoil patch.
---
You, as in your guild/pvp group - how did you monopolize the r14s?
---
I feel ya man.
---
At the end of the day, play to have fun. If you want to play Ele, do it. Just know you will have a harder time finding a group as Ele as opposed to if you were Resto or playing a Mage/Warlock. If you're cool with that, rock on.
---
Ah thanks :) wasn't sure if it was too unpolished for some but in the end it was fun for me to make for myself so I wear my sketchy edits proudly for all. 
---
Your comment means a lot, thank you :)
---
I'm going PVE, but I'm still trying to decide regular PVE or RP-PVE. I'm leaning toward RP, because I feel like the population will remain consistent, even if it's not the highest population. I don't want to get on a server that just dies in 4 months, and I definitely don't want to go where big streamers go.
---
I want the majority of specs to solid at a some major facet of the game. No 1v1s and patchwerk are not majro facets of the game. I'm talking general pvp and/or pve.  Paladins in general are bad at everything except raid healing which they are mostly ok at. Ret is so damn terrible in pve that you get almost the same benefit out of a hunter meleing with nightfall than you do a ret pally swinging one. They are also terrible in BGs as well. The best aspect of their kit is putting freedom on a warrior.
---
Oh, I get it. Thank you.
---
at least you’re being realistic and straight up posting how bad reck is.
---
Someone's being a negative nancy.
---
&gt;By...quantifying it? 
---
Alright. Approximately how good is brez compared to the extra dps of just bringing a rogue along over a feral druid? Quantify it for me, please.
---

4HM was designed for 4 tanks. Blizz wasn't expecting guilds to bring 8.
---
You seriously think only 50k will be playing this game after a month? Lol
---
Meanwhile, midnight in EU, good times
---
personally i hate the carrot on a stick design with the neck and the fact that it also makes it very alt unfriendly, it feels like you're forced to play to keep up, rather than wanting to play. Fuck BFA
---
I remember this... forgot all about this. This is classic.
---
I can’t wait to get in right at 3 and see that every one of my planned character names is taken already.
---
Med pop server. Pretty easy when you're one of two maybe three guilds with great gear on your faction.
---
On my first character (I was really young) I had a Tauren Druid named Bella. And boy did I love Bella (Until my brother deleted him). Anyways, I never had a reason to know what a tank was in a group, but I apparently was more than ready to tank RFC, and I did just get my bear form. I didn’t know Bear was for tanking, I just thought it did lots of damage or something. I just thought tanking meant best person in the group
---
So here I was, probably 10 pulls into RFC, and someone says “Let me tank” something along those lines, I dont remember the reasoning. What I do remember was I linked them my weapon to prove I am better than them. Which does not affect bear form because it was white, so not even a stat stick.
---
At that point our healer decided to “Teach” me how to tank, since they probably realized just then that I’m just a kid. I remember going through all of RFC with these guys and then they took me to WC (At that point the other guy tanked and I followed around in bear). 
---
What friendly people 😂😂😂
---
I've tanked DM:East as SL warlock. It worked but it was very bad.
---
Go Nightfall + Soul Link. (Important talents: Resist, Fel Concentration, Drain Life, Soul Link, Imp Voidwalker, Master Demonologist). 
---
Make macro with Void Sacrifice (shield) + instant resummon. 
---
Don't use life tap in battle, use mana pots. 
---
Pull with shadowbolt + searing pain + corruption + spam drain life. Use nightfall procs to build aggro with instant shadow bolts.
---
What names are good to get? Maybe like "Mage" "Warrior". Famous ingame characters? Famouse WoW PvPers?
---
NS Wrath might net you 700 extra burst damage every 3 minutes, where you'll usually not crit.  Really not impressive and most certainly not worth outside of style points.  If you crit it's nice, but honestly you're going to have 1 second Wraths already if you're critting frequently which is between most enemies swing timers and below the GCD... you can just studder step them out and feel basically instant already.
---
I'll just farm some gold and get a token. I can't seem to stay interested in any other game right now anyway, so I might as well goof around farming.
---
Added bonus for hunter, their tier sets are good for both pvp and pve
---
BGs are xrealm, and praise Elune for that
---
What kind of names could you possibly be planning that they would be taken?
---
My first meeting starts at six unfortunately. I usually leave the office around six on a good day.
---
Paladins are generally bad at everything?? WHAT THE.. bruh. Paladins are probably the best healers in the game, both in PvE and PvP.   
---
Paladins are amazing in PvP regardless of spec actually, I know how anyone could argue otherwise. (You can try ;))  
---
Ret isnt that bad in PvE, its only bad if you try to only dps. Be a blessing/heal bot and throw some int gear on, and you'll do fine.
---
Will they be providing the server IPs so that we can ping test them ?
---
Of course, honestly I just wanted to leave a passing comment and then that comment blew up and I can't leave notifications alone.
---
Anyone notice how they require you to have an active subscription to reserve names?
---
Do this for every class for me
---
Excuse me but i can't believe how toxic you are being right now.
---
You are embarrassing yourself now.
---
lmao 7 bucks to not even get my desired name on more than 3 potential servers. lmaoo
---
I'll let you know right now, this is how 90% of random groups will do it. When I first experienced it, I didn't like it but over time I understood why it was done. Sad reality is people are greedy and this is basically the only way to ensure a random player doesn't steal it and sell it.
---
Tin foil hate on, but I believe the release of server names for Wednesday will help generate more subs for the stress test Thursday.
---
You'd be surprised, cause one website gives midnight and the other one this guy linked up here gave 23h00, so still not 100% sure. Probably midnight though, like launch
---
I guess I'm not american first of all.
---
What makes this a worse conversation topic than literally any other pointless speculation?
---
Speculating about shit that doesn't matter is a way to start conversations and pass the time. The community seems like as good a topic for speculation as anything else.
---
Oh I love classic wow and I plan on playing, but there are more than a few issues it has.
---
How would you have data if no one is playing? Polls are not 100% reliable, and if you want polls there are census' here to know more or less
---
The overall difficulty of raiding. I have a growing suspicion most people will never get to see Cthun die or get past 2 Wings of Naxx.  The skill cap on old raiding has a consistently higher DPS wall than modern raids post-Cata. They are also less forgiving in their mechanics. Yes the mechanics are much simpler compared to modern day Eternal Palace, but there are a lot more OTK mechanics in vanilla then later versions of the game. Another factor is the requirement for mats at the min/max raid levels.  Most modern wow players don't know if they plan on effectively endgame raiding they will need to farm at least  6-8 hours a week to make sure you got the flasks/ oils/ pots you NEED to be competitive.  I predict 75% of the players never complete AQ40 or Naxx for these combined reasons. MC and ZG will be what the casual player raids as world buffs can carry them here, doing BWL occasionally.
---
Ahhh that makes sense! Thank you!
---
It won't be a secret that you are on a streamer server.  That is the point for them letting you know during the name reservation process that your asmongoloid or sodumbopin server may have high queue times.  Then you pray that your name is not taking on your secondary choice server and recreate your three names there.  Or go wide instead of tall and have three servers coordinated with your guild ahead of time, so you have two fall backs incase your primary server is a streamer server.
---
The only caveat is that high popularity streamers that may not chose to announce their server may get a high number of players for the first week or less while they play some wow classic before going on to the next FotM or popular new release.
---
&gt;  if it's never worth equipping?
---
Nobody said that..   What about ***unless they are max level BiS*** don't you understand?  Staff of Jordan isn't a level 60 BiS item, so the only people who actually *need* this are twinks.  Everybody else will replace it pretty quickly, so the gold is a much much better value.  This applies to *all* valuable BoEs, thus the statement:
---
&gt; It's never worth equipping valuable BoEs unless they are max level BiS.
---
What is unclear about that statement?  There is no paradox.
---
OOTL.... what is Thex?
---
Fanboys.
---
The streamers themselves aren't really the problem, imo. Asmongold is a fucking loser, imo, but most other streamers seem cool enough from the handful I've seen clips of. It's the impact it has in-game, though. Little bitches/literally worshippers of theirs will be following them around IN-GAME. So it won't be just another player in-game. It will be a mob of idiots who fanboy this other human, literally throwing their money at his feet. Pathetic. And it will have in-game impact.
---
But you don’t have to buy Classic, so it’s not technically a retail purchase? Maybe?
---
If you don't need gold and roll need anyway there's absolutely no method to determine that someone has done that. There is a way to determine if someone rolled need on an item they didn't intend using.
---
Valkyrie?
---
I would probably avoid this server like the plague. Lucky me though, I'm on EU
---
Just find a friendly guild and it will be ok. A shaman of any spec increase the dps to his group so much it really doesn't matter if his dps is lower than other casters. And yes a resto shaman does the same but I really don't think you will get 8 of them in every raid so bringing a dps shaman will solve the issue. Now if you go into raiding as a elemental you have to know that you will never to damage meters and you will have to brake your rotation to reapply totems 100% uptime is important. Also make sure to have a lot if time farming runes you will need them. In the end it is a 120% effort build whit a 75% reward
---
&gt; And yea, you don't need a prot warrior to do a dungeon. But if you're going for speed and trying to tank a lvl 60 dungeon as fury in your greens and blues, it's gonna be a lot slower than someone who is actually specced prot, in 99% of the cases. 
---
No its not, I don't where you get this from. I've done this many, many times already. There's no point in the tank being prot.
---
There won't be that many servers anyway
---
Pretty sure its fine. People on full realms have been using remote desktop mods to log themselves into the queue before they leave work for yeaaaars. That way you are through the que before you get home.
---
Yes it is as long as you aren't using any automation. I use / have used team viewer for years to get through queues and do some stuff during downtime at work.
---
So much to read here, does he have a YouTube or anything also?
---
Friends! Also a second monitor, probably.
---
Things I’d spend rage on before heroic strike while solo leveling: Battle Shout, rend, hamstrung, thunderclap, and rank 2 or higher Sunder Armor. Of them, the only one that does direct damage is tend. And, they all increase kill speed more than heroic strike.
---
Lack of versatility since none of the healers in Classic have strong DPS options (some are okay at times). Perhaps not a big drawback but in every other expansion healing classes have the versatility to play more useful DPS specs when necessary or appropriate. Kind of minor.
---
Respec costs if you choose to try and play both anyway (those meme specs are still fun even if they aren't as good as pure dps) is the other downside.
---
Why do you seemingly refuse to read my posts? Let me copy/paste for you.
---
"I'm talking about the utility brought by boosting the DPS of the pures with stuff like windfury totem, which is definitely quantifiable."
---
“Good to get” 
---
Yeah people will be totally jealous of your awesome name.
---
Considering they announced that a long time ago I’m pretty sure everyone has already noticed.
---
The warning and queues are there to discourage players creating characters there
---
Layering can do nothing with overpopulated server after it is disabled
---
Why?
---
Of course it does. Trying out specs and tweaking different talent choices is almost impossible when each change requires 50g.
---
Love the t3 shaman set 👌 t6 is also amazing
---
And I mentioned that not all utility is simply a dps buff. Quantify brez for me, please.
---
Better to get that info earlier, isn't it?
---
you are buying it, in the form of a subscription
---
Also why I like playing a warrior. New weapons feel sooooooo gooooood.
---
I remember near 24 hour stints in AV good times lol
---
The first respec is free after that, the price increase 5g pr respec until the cap of 50g.
---
I spent thousands respeccing back in the day, had a ton of fun. Respeccing wouldnt be as fun if it was free.
---
I mean most people all need in the first place to avoid that exact circumstance
---
Warlocks have a bad enough time with threat spamming shadow bolts as it is.
---
ed edd and edy was always a show I groaned when it came on cartoon network fridays. I liked johnny bravo, samurai jack, and powderpuff girls more.
---
1g
---
The same reason Alliance has the advantage in retail: Horde has to defend Galv/Iceblood Graveyard chokepoint to win while Alliance can just zerg rush to the last graveyard and start pulling after it caps. The terrain advantage that Alliance has in retail still exist in the 1.12 version of AV.
---
The first respec costs 1g, and it gradually goes up each time you do it, capping out at 50g
---
It diminishes the entire class fantasy of a warrior. Being a dwarf hunter feels better because humans cant be hunters, it characterizes the dwarf's culture to be closer to nature by comparison.
---
The class fantasy of a warrior is a mix of fighter and barbarian. Part of it is feeling like a big buffing beefcake who can smash and wreck people with might and rage. When tiny little 65lbs gnomes can do that too it really makes the class feel way more arbitrary.
---
I just spent around 20 minutes looking for an answer. The ToS specially calls out cloud gaming:
---
&gt;Cloud Computing: Use the Platform, including a Game, in connection with any unauthorized third-party “cloud computing” services, “cloud gaming” services, or any software or service designed to enable the unauthorized streaming or transmission of Game content from a third-party server to any device.
---
There's been threads about people using remote desktop and I don't see any instances of people being banned for it but obviously that doesn't mean it's 100%. At best I think it's a grey area. The purpose of that clause seems to be targeted at third party servers (like nvidia Shield or google Stadia) instead of your own machine. If you find anything let me know because I'm interested in the answer.
---
Not me, but I knew a guy who thought the only mailbox Alliance side was in Goldshire.  
---
So he'd hearth/tram/fly to SW and run down every time he wanted to check his mail.
---
Lmao, reminds me of when i played on Emerald dream in vanilla. There was a known ninja looter that was a female night elf priest, the issue is that they didn't speak english and were chinese.
---
The server had a massive need for healers and because this person ninja looted a ton of gear they had a really good load out. They still got into a shit ton of raids because healers were just needed that much and he had really good gear.
---
Hell it was probably some dude that really didn't know english and didn't know what he was doing when he took everything, remember this was before google translate worked well at all so talking to the guy was really difficult.
---
I used to stalk him on my night elf rogue just to see what he would do in his free time when i was really bored.
---
We lost 3 warriors when Naxx dropped because the top guild on the server was suddenly recruiting AQ-geared tanks.
---
We also only raided with 4-6 warriors in total. DPS warriors were not popular early in vanilla, so not many guilds had a surplus of fury warriors.
---
This. You have to wait for the evade bugged mobs to despawn.
---
Meanwhile on Horde... Ashenvale(zoram always camped flight master usually dead AND we have to run around Astranaar), Stonetalon (flight master usually dead), 1k needles/shimmering, Tanaris, Arathi(stromgarde cheese), STV (grom gol flight master always dead) Tirisfall (SM and entrance to UC picking off people from the zep), even booty bay flight master was always dead, I didnt get that FP until after level 40 because it was dead so often.
---
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HILLSBRAD!!! Not just Tarren Mill, but also the elite dwarf mobs that are friendly to alliance that we have to clear for quests.
---
compare that to my alliance character that got camped 2-3 times in Redridge...
---
I was there too my friend. This was the beauty of class design in classic. Do you want to be self reliant? Or get groups easy? Do you want to synergize with a core group of friends? Is there a particular class fantasy that appeals to you?
---
You can't go wrong on any of this especially if you go into it wanting to play with other people and make friends. Each class brings something to the table.
---
Really depends on the person. I wish they'd add an armory, and I can be a pretty hardcore classic MMO purist. It doesn't really affect anything in-game and it's a good way to compare gear vs. competing players, get ideas for upgrades, scout out potential recruits, etc.
---
The Thex meme was the fastest dead meme I've ever witnessed, it didn't even survive 24h.
---
Thanks for the help, yeah I just find that I probably would have as much fun if I'm so behind in gear because my class/spec isnt a needed. Feel like I would be better off just rolling dwarf preist and being loved by all
---
They will have a pretty good idea after the name reservation period has passed.
---
I'm 100% certain that "big" streamers will have their name reserved for them. They have direct contacts with Blizzard.
---
Definitely in the same boat. I never got to run Scholo/Strath/DM when the content was relevant. The only memory I have is blasting through those during WOTLK with heirlooms like it was nothing. Never experienced any of the classic raids, other than a failed attempt at AQ40 during BC.   
---
Going to roll a warrior with the hope of MT/OT roll, but will likely end up as a fury dps.
---
I think we all did this, most of us for YEARS at first.
---
Well what you've then done is created a situation where everyone attempts to steal an item to avoid one person stealing it.
---
cool thx for info!
---
Let's get real here... no one is going to name their character 'assasshehhe' ... it's all yours, buddy!   
---
'AssThexHehe' is more like it
---
I think you would have to grind at some point but its fun as hell to play together, after all thats what this game is about :)
---
Class balance. Some class specs are simply unplayable, not because they suck (which they do), but because there are better alternatives. TBC was the best in my opinion on this.
---
Paladins, for example, just can't compete with warriors as tanks because they lack a taunt. Simple as that. I wouldn't even ask for damage mitigations like Shield Wall, because hybrid classes shouldn't be just as good as pure classes. Just a taunt and I would be happy.
---
BiS gear that doesn't look cool! Reeeee!!!!!!
---
Damn.. good question. Such mystery even got me interested!
---
Will be eagerly waiting in here for the answer :)
---
Very mature thing to do... I'm not a big fan of streamers but I'm not gonna be a lil bitch about it.
---
20% of crit damage over time, it's roughly 8-10% DPS increase. Doubt any other class will come even close to that mate.
---
&gt;Thunderclap
---
&gt;Hamstring
---
&gt;"increases kill speed more than heroic strike"
---
uh
---
Not necessarily wrong though.  If we could have the class balance of TBC in Classic, I'd actually be hyped.
---
It will probably safe time in classic when you do it in a 5men discord coordinated leveling group and everybody knows stuff like this to the T.
---
The average group just fucks up, people fall down into uncleared mob packs and wipe the party.
---
I always level with a friend (On Pservers. PServers are pretty much confirmed to be wrong in a lot of areas) and leveling with a friend is great, especially once you get to WPVP zones. We kills mobs twice as quickly, so the only drawback is loot quests sometimes not having enough mobs. 
---
Aside from that, overlapping schedules and whatnot can get annoying but it’s a good time to chill and do professions
---
Can't wait for all these posts with screenshots of players claiming "Thex"
---
Ill be playing classic and im hype for the MoP Timewalking week soon after launch on retail. Dunno why we can't enjoy both :)
---
It's more effective to say TRY not to be jerks. Gives them a choice instead of an ultimatum. Little bit of psych 101. People would more often be morally inclined to do the right thing if you offer them a choice heavily implying the good side instead of "be nice."
---
If you're playing classic wow there is always grind. Just do what's most fun for you. Open world I personally prefer a duo or trio though. But that is just my preference
---
ahhhhh right when i have class =( 
---
to skip or not to skip that is the question
---
unless you have some name you really want and know it will be contested its just scamming you out of 7 bucks.
---
Really need to separate EU / NA guild recruiting.
---
I'm sure they can run the data on the number of characters created per faction per server from the 12th - go live date.
---
There’s only been a handful of times in my life where I’ve truly enjoyed an “I told you so” and I’ll be damned if  [this ](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294258/character-name-reservation-for-wow-classic-monday-august-12-3pm-pdt) isn’t my favorite of all. Suck it Trebek.
---
Sorry man, but you haven't really done much to convince me, other than getting angry. Have a good day.
---
From what blizzard has said, and with the implementation of layering, they expecting a massive influx maybe even expecting close to 10 million to sub for a month.But they also expect the numbers to drop fast, which is why they plan to remove layers after just a few months.
---
And to think I did the Exalted grind in vanilla. Never again.
---
"A level 10 character is required to post on the forums"  
---
Okay... I haven't played since Cata, and I no longer have characters on my account. How am I supposed to interact with the classic community before launch? I was hoping to advertise our upcoming guild but I feel that its a bit bonkers to ask me to buy a current version of the game, level a character to 10 only so that I can create a forum post for the Classic Version...
---
game client
---
I'm not going to re-sub until launch.
---
3.
---
Or 2 if you already don’t have tons of play time
---
Which it is so widely applied. Everyone wants gold, no one wants to risk something so high value being stolen, it's the safest option. If you want fair distribution of equipable gear find a nice loot council group.
---
Male Night Elf Rogue! Combat DAGGERS (is the aim)!
---
I say NEIGH to the min maxers. All the videos really make me wanna go human, but I see night elf’s in the rogue tier sets and it convinces me.
---
Also never levelled a night elf or a rogue. Making this experience as fresh as possible.
---
i thought yellow mobs would aggro you like red mobs... so i pulled all of the ones in my way before they would aggro me. This went on for waaaaay too long before i realized.
---
Given that it currently has 0 active players that is a strange assessment to make.
---
To me I think it comes down to reward structure. Vanilla was more grindy but also felt more rewarding. It is partly the grind itself that makes it feel rewarding. When the reward is gained too easily it starts to feel mundane and expected. Small upgrades feel significant, as do small decisions like talent points. It feels like there is weight to these decisions, even if not a lot as you can still respec and such if you regret the choice.
---
I'm confused. I could have sworn I played on a pvp server named Frostwolf, but that's not an option on the classic connections forum. Does anyone else remember this server or am I nuts? 2004-2007 ish.
---
Come on man, you know what he means.  If you like these genres then you know that the general populace will lump everything together under a single genre.  A WoW forum isn't the place to get pissed at people for mistaking or mis-genreing acid jazz downtempo or whatever sub-sub-genre for techno.
---
If I tell people I like electronic music and they say "Oh, like Skrillex" I say no, but other artists similar to him.  I don't try to explain how Aphex Twin is different than Skrillex because who cares?
---
Some guy made the crucial mistake of posting his chosen name for his main, unwittingly birthing this generations most sought after bank-alt name.
---
Im going mage because I love how connected you feel playing a mage. Everyone always wants food water and portals.
---
Let us know how you really feel!

Horde &lt;B Y O B&gt; | Horde NA PVP | Hard-Casual / Semi-Serious Raiding
---
ABOUT US
---
We're a hard-casual PVP Horde guild looking for people who have lives outside of WoW but still like to log in and TCB on the weekends.  Our guild leadership ran guilds during Vanilla and have experience with MC, ZG, BWL, etc.  Now we'd like to kick back and enjoy Classic with fellow chill adults who have a job, family, and life outside of WoW--but who still understand what it takes to prepare for raid night.  This guild was made for YOU.
---
BYOB's priority will be raiding but we also plan to make an impact on PvP with guild pre-mades.
---
GOALS
---
Raiding is our main priority, but we're not in a rush to get to 60.  We'd like to be 60 and raid-ready by late Nov-Dec.  Let's enjoy the grind and help each other prepare for raiding.
---
Main raid: Fridays and Saturdays, 3 hour(~9:30pm-12am estTBD) raid nights on weekends, with weekday raids coming once ZG launches. 
---
LOOT
---
A combination roll and Loot Council. Things are going to be as fair as possible. (Still TBD) example...weapons, rings, trinkets on loot council, members will know where these items go before we even step inside the raid. MT/OT will have priority, but other than that all set pieces free roll.
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Be punctual (on time).
---
Be excellent to each other.
---
Play your class to the best of your ability.
---

Man that would be annoying if they didnt include time zones
---
The fun thing is you get to almost always pick your fights as a druid in Vanilla. Between being able to shapeshift out of most things, travel form, stealth, and heals, you can quite often get away if ganked, and it's great being able to sneak up on someone in cat form and gank the shit out of them yourself. So I find that to be really fun.
---
This! you're the only other person to say it!  6-8 hrs a week need to be sunk into mats. This is no joke. Raiding is a part time job.
---
Killspeed is kills per minute. You can kill faster if you don’t have to eat every pull. I literally don’t have to eat before level 30 because I can keep killing, then Bloodrage/bandage every 3 kills. If you’re using heroic strike as anything but a rage dump, you’re wasting rage.
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/french-and-german-realms-for-wow-classic/60051
---
That's four languages and it's safe to assume both PvE and PvP for each, and RP has been confirmed as well.
---
SERVER FORUMS PLZ!!!!!!
---
Trash respawning in dungeons/raids.
---
It was as essentially a forced time limit, it was the game saying "fuck your pace". Never liked it.
---
Go run some tests and get back to me with your numbers. I have played a long time as a Shaman, and I can tell you, even with a LUCKY triple crit on a WF proc, I will not drop anyone in that single attack unless I vastly out gear them.
---
&gt;Which it is so widely applied.
---
That's an appeal to numbers, which is a logical fallacy. It doesn't justify the action.  
---
&gt; Everyone wants gold 
---
Everyone has the ability to press greed.
---
Just to piss off the people who trusted the meter above all else, I once challenged my guild leader that I could top both healing and dmg meters for an MC boss (Chromaggus, I think).
---
He said I was an idiot, but then I did it. Blessing of Sacrifice, baby.
---
So this isn’t exactly my area of expertise, but I’d assume Priest is easier to gear. Anethema/Benediction is incredible and used until AQ 40 which is arguably the most important part of your upgrades, and aside from that almost all healing gear is cloth anyway. I could be wrong but knowing you have a BIS raid weapon until AQ 40 coming seems like it would make the overall hearing process easier, especially since you can go shadow with it too
---
No, not all of it is simply a DPS buff. But a lot of it is. So you can go based off that and leave cute little bonuses like brez, DI, ankh, tremor totem, BoP, etc as just that...little bonuses. 
---
The whole point is that attempting to quantify the value of the utility is part of the gameplay of putting together a raid comp. Do we need slightly more DPS, or do we need bres? It helps when the numbers aren't horribly lopsided, and, wait for it...
---
tbc was, imo, when the numbers were least-lopsided while also maintaining an interesting niche for utility classes. Just like I said in my original post. Feel free to disagree, just stop with the pithy comments pls
---
They do these events every year. One year it was an MC Timewalking, one year it was Battle for Southshore/TM, now its a classic-inspired AV...this isn't shocking by any means.
---
Are you sure? I thought the first respec was 1g?
---
No offense but I'd avoid it. Too many tryhards here lol.
---
&gt;People hated jail break.
---
Because it's technically easy. You pull a group, kill it, and then move onto the next. But booooy does Marshall Windsor think that's a terrible idea and you should in fact pull everything at once.
---
Gank redridge.
---
Lmao I said pvp was boring in naxx gear and you launch into some fucking crusade for internet truth as if it was IMPOSSIBLE to do pvp on the side when you raided naxx. Have fun with your life and try not to get jealous of people's success from 15 years ago when they were still a teenager.
---
That really depends on what I've eaten. After some Chipotle my asshole feels really toxic.
---
Did a quick search and also couldn't find some, but pretty sure it exist somewhere. I had a few but sadly a few years ago I wiped my PC and forgot to backup my vanilla wow folder... Lost all of my pics from that time but like 1 or 2 ...   There is also a few topic on b.net forum with some reporting some game going up to 7day. If i find some i'll let you know ! (Sorry for horrible english, it's my second language).
---
Dont think those were a thing in classic
---
They both share the same loot tables lol dresses ftw
---
Hope there is a realm named Tpaartos
---
On the other hand rogues consider it unfair to have warrior stand around with 1h + 3000 armor shield + defensive stance.
---
A duel for most people is to learn and test their skill.
---
Kiting a warrior 41yards away does not really help the hunter improve his scatter +feign death + trap usage. 
---
A warlock opening up on a warrior with 30 yards away with curse of exhaustion + other dots will win 100% of the time.
---
In the end yes, you can open like that, but the duel is pretty much wasted time.
---
You didn't show your skill against the warrior and you learned nothing.
---
Ketchup, i see a man of class.
---
Yes, after the stress test anyone with an active subscription can create up to three characters before the launch, so you can reserve your name(s).
---
I'm probably retarded for asking this question, but 3 Pdt is apparently 12 am CEST, does that mean that is it the "morning of tuesday" for me?... i'm having a difficult time figuring out when to fuck up my sleep schedule to wake up at night just to reserve a name
---
Besides the fact, who would really care if it was Lay on Hands.  As long as it is part of your toolkit.  Some of these are freaking funny.  It would be like telling a rogue to not go stealth for an unfair advantage.  LOL
---
We will finally this week get our first answer from all the RP PvP feedback! 
---
Without a doubt no realms with it though, but an answer!
---
Druids are the cure for altoholism. If you get the itch to play a different role just farm a bit of gold to change your spec :).
---
So you're going hunter this time around as well?
---
I remember people talking so much shit about hunters in the chats and I was afraid I'd made a bad choice. Stayed away from duels and any pvp for quite a while, and then I duelled my rogue friend around level 30 and I just smoked him, couldn't believe it haha. My greatest world pvp moment was getting jumped by no less than 3 rogues at the same time, they obviously thinking what an easy kill. After some magnificent kiting, feign death+freezing trap and what have you, I emerged victorious.
---
Yeah, just talking about that makes me more inclined to choose hunter again. Also, traveling the world searching for rare exotic pets, ah!
---
You are correct and incorrect. As far as World of warcraft is concerned the horde are not the aggressors anymore. That happens when the horde was under the control of the pitlords and guldan and others. But under the reign of Thrall, they are the good guys.
---
it's exactly like any other community. You have unreasonable people from both communities who shit on games that aren't theirs and you have reasonable people who don't. This is literally any gaming community out there, Classic Wow nor BFA are any different.
---
\# &lt; Middle Management &gt; Semi-Hardcore Raiding Guild, NA-PVP, Alliance
---
\# Loot System: EPGP
---
\&amp;#x200B;
---
We will be implementing EPGP but there will be clear priorities given to specific classes/spec/roles with our focus being on raid progression. Members will be awarded additional EP based on guild contributions, such as material farming, having all raid consumables, flasking for progression, and being keyed and ready for raiding within a month of launch. We will also be implementing a decaying element and will have clear spreadsheets detailing item price and priority closer to launch.
---
Each month players will be given an opportunity to list one off-spec item they wish to have priority on. After main spec is figured out the item will be decided on by /roll to those that have priority. If no one has priority then it is open to everyone else to /roll on.
---
All legendary items will be decided on by way of loot council.
---
\# Raid Times:
---
Plan is to Raid Tuesday and Thursday with Sunday or Monday as our clean up date.
---
Raids will begin at 9:00 PM EST and last roughly 3-4 hours.
---
\# Who We Are:
---
We are a group of old Vanilla Raiders who kept in touch and have played on and off over the years. As a result our core is a bit older with most of us being in our 30s. We have varied levels of experience from those that missed out on vanilla to others that have cleared Naxx. Our focus is on raiding and progressing through the content.
---
With our home and family lives we are not focused on world or server firsts. We want to be successful in raids, but we are not a hardcore or min/max community. We expect raiders to be on time, have needed consumables, have their gear enchanted, and be appropriately spec'd. We will never dictate what race to play, deadlines for reputation grinds, or professions (with first aid being the exception). We may award additional EP for achieving some of these goals based on future needs. (Such as being exalted with ZG within a time frame for enchants or crafting recipes)
---
We are a social group and all are welcome to apply. Anyone looking to level casually, pvp without the R14 grind, have a group to run 5 mans with, and even potentially get into raiding later on are all welcome. I can't say as a boomkin that there will be a raid slot, but you will likely be able to find a guild UBRS group and some people to run WSG with.
---
\# Class Needs:
---
Currently open to all classes.
---
Our focus is on raid progression and while all are welcome, raid slots will be reserved to those willing to spec for filling needed roles.

Sounds like a fantastic idea.
---
Let's just make a flat surface with all the quests arranged in a giant spiral shape.
---
I support you on this OP.  I shall wait patiently in the shadows until the filthy Hordes attack you and then, provided one is low enough health, and you aren't vastly outnumbered, shall rush to your aid!
---
Yep, the later rank grinds are just too much and encourage extremely unhealthy behavior.
---
This isn't retail where you can say and do whatever without any repercussions. People are going to have to be nicer because you will see them over and over again. Server reputation will matter.
---
This thread is useless.
---
Im all for classic, but most of this stuff is still in retail, and not even worse in retail.
---
30 energy for distract is very costly though. I guess they could wait but you would be instantly on alert
---
More propaganda. I see green I kill
---
That you can eat and drink at the same time
---
&gt;orcs come through a magical portal murdering everyone, women and children along with soldiers
---
&gt;they do so by raising undead corpses to fight with them and summoning demons
---
&gt;eventually they lose the war, and they're allowed to stay alive, and put into camps instead of just burned in a shallow grave
---
&gt;REEEE WHY ALLIANCE SO MEAN TO US???
---
I've heard that any class which can go Orc, should because their racials are altogether bonkers. That being said, playing Tauren lets you play Tauren, so my choice is clear.
---
I still remember getting shit for capping Snowfall in one of my very first games.  I initially just assumed that the point was to cap as much as possible and didn't understand why it was a problem.
---
Definitely the respec cost. It was an absolute pain as a healer to farm raid consumables.
---
I won't do the same mistake again and roll a mage. I'd love to play paladin again, but there is no way I have the time to farm with the most laughable dps-specs of them all, which is holypala.
---
I leveled to 60 as holy with my first char, therefor I had no comparison for a long time of how much easier it could be with another class.
---
Pretty much everyone does, we're all sick to death of semantic arguments derailing actual discussions.
---
No gear is absolutely useless. All gear can be sold. BoEs just sell for more, and hundreds of gold is more useful than a couple of gold, which is useful to some extent.
---
PeOpLe DoNt GaNk LoWbIeS tHaT mUcH oN pVp SeRvErS

Battleground matchmaking will take players from all realms (or a battlegroup of some sort, who knows)
---
"no one does wpvp at 60 because bgs"
---
i'll be seeing your noob ass at brm. better watch ur back kiddo.
---
High value is basically anything boe blue or better, and some specific green items
---
I know they sometimes went on more than ten hours but the longest AV I was in was around five hours, and I thought it was the most epic thing ever.
---
I'm gonna piggy back off this post.
---
Is leveling tailoring to 300 and crafting Robes of the Archmage worth it? How long will it last?
---
Will I have to buy a copy of wow classic, or is it sub only?
---
Skip. The answer is skip. Skip the class. Don't go to class that day.
---
I'll be impressed if I make it in 2 months.
---
Much respect!
---
It’s not that it’s not in retail, but it’s what made the classes distinct. It’s not flavor if everyone can do everything. Who cares if a mage has a port? You can hearth and teleport anywhere on 15 min cool down. Seal form? There’s a fishing rod for that. Etc
---
That at least had the side effect of extra XP.
---
I think raiding will take a lot less time than it used too because people know how to play MMOs now. Also I agree that progression through Classic is much better because the world is a threat so you have to be more careful and it is an actual adventure rather than just a level grind.
---
write into google "3 pm pdt" and it will tell you, no need to enter a website.
---
I never joined the cabal of douchebags.
---
I joined the cabal of "Just fucking walk".
---
Cause seriously I was sick of doing everything in vanilla and I still am to this day. Even on retail I'll wait for pug locks or new locks to drop cookies and portal before I do.
---
This whole post is that its annoying. &gt;Druids - Could teleport to their sanctuary of Moonglade - Could turn into a seal and breath/move quickly underwater - Could turn into a tank or melee dps at a moments whim
---
Warlocks - Can steak the souls of enemies and be the only class able to summon, create soul stones, health stones - 60 Mount quest you go to the back of an extremely deep cave in Felwood I didn’t even know existed and speak with a Dread Lord
---
Mages - Can teleport and portal at any time they wished - Can make food and water - Blink (Sounds dull but blink is the tits) - Freeze into a block of ice - Slow fall
---
the first 3 classes he lists are literally the exact same in retail
---
That's not how it was on vanilla so it should not be like that on classic. The point of vanilla is that you play on a realm and you inky face people from said realm.
---
If you were into WoW podcasts back during Vanilla/TBC you've almost definitely heard of these guys.
---
Earlier today they dropped that a new episode will be dropping for the first time in years on August 30th.
---
Honestly, I just needed someone to get the hype out of my system.
---
If you haven't heard of them I highly recommend you give some of their old podcasts a listen -- it's a great mix of funny, WoW discussion, and just general geeky conversation.
---
Okay, that's fine, but unconstructive complaining just ruins everyone else's hype. Not to single out Another\_Road -- this sub has a lot of that.
---
Lakeshire: A Horde town with Alliance quests.
---
&gt;Implying I don't sleep at work
---
I think the grind was built in to classic by lower drop rates &amp;  big rewards from long chains. BFA feels more grindy due to smaller rewards
---
Why doesn’t blizz to “rolling ladders” like diablo?
---
We could easily get to the point where a new expansion server drops every 3-6 months and people who want to progress to BfA can migrate their characters forward through each expansion. 
---
You could literally give players the option to stay on any expansion as long as they’d like and let them choose whether they want to play on new / old servers if they choose to migrate to the next expansion.
---
undead are clearly evil, orcs and trolls dumb violent savages. tauren are good though
---
BoE's should always be rolled as Need when in a random group.  Just because that one person says they need it does not actually mean they are going to put it on that exact moment.  In a lot of cases, they end up selling it so those that rolled Greed are now screwed out of that money.
---
In random groups, and this is established at the beginning just in case:
---
BoE = Everyone rolls need
---
BoP = Only roll need if you are/can use it and will equip it.
---
How about Thexist? Can I use that?
---
If you have national streamers it’s almost impossible to escape because there will be prob. one PvP Server in German were every German streamer will play
---
I still remember Fusion's tits of turalyon. Great times.
---
pally shit never drops
---
Are we sure warriors will still be top DPS? I keep seeing that pop up, but it's all based on pserver data, no? With that revelation about boss parry, dodge, hit cap, etc., are we sure that will still be the case? Is it still the most likely to be top, or is it all up in the air now? Were warriors top DPS at the actual 1.12 in 2006?
---
&gt; you can swim in lava
---
Sold. Druid it is.
---
Avoidstreamers.com is also keeping track of if. But there’s no promise that he will keep it updated so all the power to you!
---
Dear god no
---
To be fair Hex of weakness is both a racial and a class spell. Only priests know it, and only if they are a troll
---
Tank
---
&gt;   A WoW forum isn't the place to get pissed at people for mistaking or  mis-genreing acid jazz downtempo or whatever sub-sub-genre for techno. 
---
Strawman argument. We aren't talking about Sub-sub genres. In fact based on that reply i'm not sure you know what Techno is (House and Trance are not Sub-sub genres of Techno). Also your the only one saying I am angry, in fact the only people who are angry are the people misusing the genre names. Nobody has this issue when talking about different types of rock, but when it comes to electronic music it is all Techno, EDM, and Electronica.
---
&gt; If I tell people I like electronic music and they say "Oh, like  Skrillex" I say no, but other artists similar to him.  I don't try to  explain how Aphex Twin is different than Skrillex because who cares? 
---
Unrelated point. If he just said electronic music playlist there would be no issue as it would be accurate.
---
Thanks for that!  I'm not really up on streamers so just having a list as a point of reference is excellent.
---
Was always fun to see who you ganked and see what stage they are at now.

yeah but when it sells for 500g using it to level is fully stupid
---
Run by an airline with an impeccable safety record too
---
Will it be as good as a pure DPS?  Probably not.  Easier than the other classes in their healing specs?  Absolutely.
---
Yeah it’s a weird amalgamation of an changes - lots of 1.12 geography and NPC count/damage combined with pre-1.12 things like land mines and korrak (who used to be up in the mountain path east of iceblood/stonehearth).  I am super intrigued to see if the live event will be the early early AV or just the 1.12 one we’ll be getting in classic.  No mines, no elites, no pvp.
---
what about it?
---
It’s a good question! We can be certain they will be top tier at least, but it’s proving that PServers are wrong in a lot of areas so we can’t say for sure (Not their fault, finding values for everything for those servers must be a nightmare)
---
I watched &amp;listened to this so many times when I was a kid lamenting over some 13 year old girl
---
That's so awful... If someone admitted they were in their first dungeon I would probably go all out to make it a more exciting and fun experience for them. I remember my first dungeons and they were all bad experiences for me; it made me not want to dungeon until LFD was a thing, and it makes me wonder how many cool things I might have missed out on!
---
Sorry you guys got unlucky with your dungeon mates. :(
---
The best duo partner for a mage is, surprisingly, another mage
---
I grind some max level herbs and mines and side level the next character on the side to herb and mine then when 60 with that one level the main professions on the main. EX BSM and ENG or something else along those lines BSM ALC. I think getting an alt leveling is important. and obviously to run some end dungeons to start gearing for good content.
---
The last thing I heard about it is that some of the animations they used back in the days of classic do not exists anymore and they couldn't bother to reassign existing animations or redo missing animations for new models.
---
I don't know if it has changed since then.
---
Yeah there were many sites around the time where you could make a character profile. Most guilds wanted one when you applied.
---
Sorry, but I'm already the Thexiest Shaman alive.
---
I loved TBC, but even at the time I didn’t like daily quests or a faction neutral capital city. I prefer the Horde vs Alliance rivalry more.
---
blizzard too buys making cash shop mounts to fix game systems soz
---
Get full prebis pve and pvp gear. start raiding. Make 5 million gold so I can afford to pvp in phase 2-4
---
The trolls were there before the humans right? are they not the oldest of all the races?
---
Part of it is also time invested. Later on 60-70 and 70-80 took quite a while and on top on 1-60 it starts to feel like far too much. It's not so bad if you already have a gang of mains and alts from the previous expansion but as a fresh character those multiple months start to become major deterant. Especially if the zones themselves lack variety(I'm looking at you Cata.)
---
Oh sorry didn’t know you were a sergeant on the stupid police.. carry on officer.
---
Huh, I hadn't thought of it like that. For the most part yeah, they kinda are... heavily reliant on context though.
---
You have no freaking clue what you're talking about.
---
I definitely don’t want to do that... if I outroll her for a tier piece I’ll be cut off!
---
you just prove my point that alliance are the bad guys haha
---
You're just listing all of the pure DPS classes minus hunter and saying they're the best, but I don't get what they're supposed to be the best at? 1v1? 1v2? Premades? BGs? World PvP? Every one of the aforementioned activities?
---
You're not saying WHAT they're the best at, you're just saying they're "the best".
---
Yeah I agree with this one.
---
A BoP drop that has clear mage stats can clearly only benefit a mage.
---
A BoE drop can clearly benefit anyone. No one should get dibs just because it is best for their class.
---
pally is the best pvp healer in the game, though
---
WoW has an estimated 2-3 million subs at the moment while 100 million accounts had been created in 2014. We outnumber them, it makes sense that there are more people bashing the modern game than Vanilla if going by those numbers.
---
People who enjoy the modern game are busy with just that, the modern game. Very few people who enjoy the modern game and don't want classic is gonna go to forums or subreddits dedicated to it at all, because why would they?
---
It killed WPVP and changed the feel of the size of the world. I like flying mounts but the consequences are too big for me to say it was healthy for the game
---
I said please.
---
You can choose any combination of servers but it's still no more than 3 characters across all servers per account.
---
Which makes me suspect that this *name reservation* is just usual limit of 50 characters per account lowered to 3 and without possibility of entering game world.
---
Flying had its pros and cons. Pro: Fly over the continent faster and get straight to your destination. Con: You’re flying over the continent and going straight to your destination.
---
Exactly. Tough to find a guild with the thought of them going into a server I want to avoid.
---
Both are umbrella terms and can be used somewhat interchangeably. *Eurodance* would be a more precise term for most of what is on this playlist.
---
Oh, it's not my channel, I'm just a fan of the podcast.
---
Definitely toss them a sub though, it's a great podcast to binge while gaming.
---
kek
---
Oh look, an enemy player coming right at me. 
---
\*woosh\*
---
I'm excited to play a mage and not be a mouse clicking keyboard turner.
---
Thanks.
---
And don't worry, I'm not going to tell any secrets.  Don't want to just give away the keys to the kingdom.
---
I started at the age of 9 at the tail end of TBC as it was a birthday gift and its on Dec but I loved every minute of it and have played even upto this day and I am so hyped to play what I missed in a legit way instead of the private servers.
---
[This](https://soundcloud.com/tayyip-korkmaz-1/best-dance-trance-mix-robert) is a mix I found on limewire way back in the day that I'd listen to while grinding. 
---
I'm still looking for another mix I used to listen to that has [Gigi D'Agostino's I'll Fly With You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEkMw7wz_eA) as the second song, if anyone happens to know where I can find it.
---
That is a lot of text with no new information.
---
Retail bad
---
AB and WSG are in phase 3.
---
I never mandated it. The fights easy.
---
Until a month later when 80 percent of the players have given up.
---
&gt; 3 pm pdt
---
to be precise its midnight CEST.
---
it was stupid of you, yes. if a soj drops it’s like a sack of gold dropped. everyone needs it. people greed on low value greens as a courtesy. when the big bills come out you’ve got to be more careful. it’s why jewelry stores have security guards and bakeries don’t.
---
The point is that your version of vanilla is not the only possible version of it.
---
Pirated server players are always toxic.   Just look at this sub.
---
Drive truck up a hill&gt;Tie break pedal&gt;Climb under front tire&gt;pull string&gt;Play WoW classic in heaven.
---
And the slippery slope to an arcade game with no substance begins.
---
pretty sure I was specific in my post. classic timeline under thrall.
---
Using healing potions during duels was frowned upon.
---
you'd need a really good healer since you're taking full damage from hellfire including damage from the mobs that are hitting you.
---
The entire backbone of the game is based on 1.12. They can obviously gate and deploy raids and dungeons.
---
/u/Sage_On_Reddit thoughts?
---
Thats exactly what happened to me.  I was 9 in 2004 and my friend's father was in the beta (I lived in Irvine at the time so he must have knew someone at Blizzard.)  I never seriously got into the game until I got a job and my own money in 2013.  I'm so excited to not only experience the nostalgia of my 1-40ish experience, but getting to do all those things I never got to do in the first place.
---
Later levels you can reliably take down 2, sometimes 3 mobs easily as well with minimal downtime. Send your pet to aggro a couple, pull threat on one, face tank it while you shoot the one your pet has aggro on, finish it off while your pet growls the one attacking you, kill that one. Not to mention being able to solo pretty much any elite quest you’re properly leveled for!
---
Hotspot! My internet is less than reliable so I have to do that on a semi-regular basis anyway.
---
Is naxx out on August 27?
---
So he's almost blind?
---
Yeah, it was rough.  For a class that was supposed to be the most versatile, your talents sure pigeon-holed you into a singular role.
---
&gt; Their main disadvantages are lack of sustain and lack of options vs multiple mobs.
---
While limited, evasion and blade flurry are hugely helpful for multiple mobs. Generally one of them can help you get through a pack of 2-3, just gotta stagger using them and be careful about pulling and you can probably always have one handy in a pinch. Now, you'll have to eat after, but w/e. I learned the hard way that as fun as daggers are, it's combat or bust for leveling. Also, slice and dice is your friend. Plus, I like not having to worry about my mana/rage/energy resources when leveling, no auto attack/wand, just keep my health up a bit and go ham, but that's just me.
---
yes, its midnight at tuesday morning 0:00.
---
The class balance in vanilla is indefensible, and it's only controversial here because a lot of players are threatened by any mention of bringing their spec in line.
---
Let me rephrase that:  
---
You fly over the continent and you fly over the **content**. xD
---
I’m aware you would have to outgear them and they would have to be cloth and maybe leather but...it’s still possible..so yes it was an incorrect blanket statement
---
I don’t care about competing for gear, just don’t want to mage it up. The “don’t want to heal” part is hard. I like healing but I’ve rarely dps’d and that sounds fun too.
---
Yeah I don’t have any memory of the wow forums where they weren’t full of toxic idiots.  It’s like MMOC except maybe a little less elitist...but not much.
---
You get less xp but your also killing mobs faster do it evens out. Besides it’s so much more fun with friends
---
TRUST me on battlegroups being a good thing. Joining some 6 ally / 7 horde AB that immediately gives you a message of closing in 2 minutes because of insufficient players is not fun.
---
Oh yeah I totally was. And I guess I don't remember what was available to use in AV either.
---
Warlock sounds like your pick
---
Whitegrape is a ganker and sharphealz and littlechuck would fight him. I am becky and I babysit littlechuck because our warriors need help
---
No you wont, not in classic.
---
Retail meaning the current product, so a while ago Legion was Retail. If someone says BFA or Retail they are referring to the same game, at least for now. When the next expansion comes along, nobody will refer to BFA as Retail anymore.
---
Am I right to remember that Classic has a separate slightly cheaper sub rate for a stand-alone version? Or did they do away with that?
---
I didn't have one until reading this post, but now that I think about it...
---
It will be kind of embarrassing to show up to work after I took a week of PTO to play video games.
---
I'll never forget critting 20k with Judgement in ICC
---
Bet Thrall gets taken in the first 5 minutes.
---
A forced meme cringefest.
---
smh
---
Cloud gaming is technically account sharing, that's all there is to it. There's zero reason to worry about remote login.
---
Uh not really... the first 60s will have the abundance of black lotus, devilsaur leather,  ect all to themselves.  
---
Keep being trendy though,  mate.
---
I was thinking this while mindlessly tanking a heroic last night. Sure you have way more buttons to press, but there is basically no reason to look at anything but the buttons. Druid tanks in classic had about 4 moves, but you have to be constantly watching threat on any targets you're tanking, keeping good positioning, and being ready to grab targets when crowd control ends.
---
I forgot mounts didnt scale back then honestly so I cant be trusted anymore
---
I thought bind on equip meant you bound that item to that slot and were stuck with it forever.
---
How is that nickel and diming? I want to be in the stress test so I can practice grinding. I find value in that so I'm willing to sub early. I also want to make sure I get the name I want. So it's worth it to me. I don't find it "useless". If you want to talk about purchasing a "skin" or something, in some other game, that's fine. But it has nothing to do with this discussion. You're just making yourself look either misinformed, or tyrannical (your opinion should be everyone's opinion, etc.).
---
Why do you give a shit what other people do? I'm not criticizing your choice. Why do you criticize others?
---
I’m leaning that way for sure. Pally/shaman is very tempting too. I guess I could alt the lock since they are much more viable solo.
---
&gt; Of course you can get stuck with terrible weapons
---
Nice thing for a warrior is, if they're a little patient/willing to tank and hit every dungeon they can, I bet they could put together a plan that includes keeping a pretty solid weapon on hand semi-reliably - I imagine it'll still be slow, but also that the solo questing will be less painful. Rogues, on the other hand, are gonna have a tougher time being able to just jump into an instance :(
---
At least I got chicken...
---
Laintime, he’s so hot right now
---
That's a good point.
---

Just don’t compare yourself with ppl that are neets. 
---
Take your time, and accept that you will not be able to do everything.
---
I’ve never heard of that. Was seeding ever a real thing that could be influenced?
---
 A very small, small percentage of the player base will be really awful to new players.
---
Uhhh where is Zul'Jin on the find old homies thing?
---
Death is a good alternative.
---
Because actually getting to do BG's is better than getting to see that one random nobody on your server in the one BG you get to play in a 12 hour period.
---
They cannot use Axes.
---
I’m 30 and I don’t have my own business or kids. I won’t be able to find lots of time so it will be impossible to be addicted. Surely you just won’t have the time
---
Yeah anything over a 10m CD is unfair to use IMO unless you’re dueling best outta 3.
---
Downtime. Spending 75% of your game time either walking to and from places or sitting and eating/drinking just feels like a lot of wasted time to me.
---
Close second would be class design. I think Vanilla -&gt; TBC was the single largest improvement the game has ever had, gameplay-wise. I like that Vanilla classes are really well-defined and have unique roles and utility, but it comes at the cost of *extremely* barebones rotations and mechanics.

Yeah I wasn't a fan of the AP farm in Legion, but I also wasn't afraid of just playing whenever I wanted/had time and just let the catch up mechanics kick in.  I do hate that with dailies and emissaries you feel punished for not playing for a day.  I'm Vanilla, I could just play more on the weekend to make up for time missed during the week, if I even felt the need to "catch up".
---
Really looking forward to nerding out for Classic launch then tuning it back to more casual weekend play with a fee hours here and there during the week and not feeling bad if I don't log in for a random night because real life got in the way.
---
Hm, I don't know if that makes sense. Besides shaman/paladin both factions can pick the classes, so there's no reason why hunter represent horde or rogues represent the alliance.
---
I think you should've went more for "what works with the background"-approach. Both hunter and shaman look strange because their respective colour don't have a good contrast to the red horde background imo.
---
Rogues can’t use axes until WOTLK. And Orc just gets a bonus in Axe
---
You act like I'm not already addicted.
---
Nope.
---
Getting yanked while in combat at 25% life as a warrior. Like fuck you asshole you’d kill me fair why not wait for me to not be in combat.
---
Classic is the new retail. Retail is the new classic.
---
Yo when did you fall into the Dead Sea homie you salty a f
---
Bad vibes bro
---
I’m just saying if a warden staff crops and a feral Druid doesn’t get their bis until aq cause people think needing means I need gold that is super lame.
---
There are plenty of games with addon support, WoW is just the big one.
---
We are all marklar
---
You're just bloodying it up so much that it's patchy and worthless. :)
---
If being realistic is being salty, then yes. Nice meme btw
---
I remember you can jump the instant you land so you take no lava damage. Do we know if that was the case in the beta?
---
I'll actually argue the opposite. The old honor system was okay if you just accept the fact that not everyone gets to be "High Warlord." The highest rank isn't won like a participation trophy.
---
Weakness and plague are their spells. I think they just worship death itself or something.
---
But of course you can
---
More likely the retail game servers just won't be up and you'll get an ordinary error message.
---
Yeah, combat really makes things easier than everyone thinks for a rogue, even before blade flurry which is just freaking amazing for leveling. A 2/3 point SnD to open a fight alone will make a world of difference.
---
mobile hotspot and log on the laptop.
---
For casual cata babies and MoP toddlers it is
---
Have fun vendoring grey items and planning your talent tree, old man!
---
look at these mental gymnastics. boomkin good in pvp? lmao.
---
Yeah come to think of it I'd probably put raid size at #1 over class balance.  I still remember every single person I ran Kara with.
---
IIRC most warriors weren't prot for tanking because it was harder to build rage in prot and going more DPS in another spec meant generating more threat.
---
Terrible idea. It would accentuate faction imbalance. 
---
"Oh there's 60% alliance on that server? I'll roll alliance as I don't want to be in the underdog faction"
---
Next thing you know there's now 70% alliance on that server.
---
Thanks for the reply, back to the drawing board for me haha.
---
A lot of the old world was nerfed in patch 2.3, with lots of places that had elites being converted to normals.  Leveling through on vanilla there are a lot more dangerous places in the world.
---
go pve alliance, is the best
---
All it really does is help them by adding a flimsy layer of anonymity.
---
I'm 85% sure you are 100% correct
---
go to the russian one, improvise adapt overcome
---
So it’s a little bit of a lie to say you’d run out of quests per se. Classic wow has numerous zones for every level range. So you may run out of quests in a zone but you can just go to another zone and do those quests. You’d also be completing the quests in half the time, easily completing group quests that would otherwise require you find a group, and you can do higher level quests that you might struggle with solo otherwise. You can additionally occasionally run a dungeon. Done right you won’t necessarily have to grind if it’s just two of you.
---
No jnternet? Man it is 2019
---
Not like all names are gone when you are 3 hours late.
---
PvP and Alliance is the best choice.
---
Well it really comes down to this. Do you want to feel powerful in pve/pvp?
---
Mage/Warrior
---
If you don't care about that pick any other class and accept the fact you're not really good at anything.
---
It also keeps people in one role, forcing them to be good at it. Once dual spec became available every ret-pally started volunteering to tank or heal, despite having no idea how to do those things.
---
Monday - Wednesday here too :) thanks for labor day blizzard!
---
I scrolled through the topic, but cannot seem to find the amount of servers you mentioned? The topic only mentions that the exact number will be announced at a later date.
---
The biggest problem was mana. It's quite risky to use Life Tap while tanking.
---
Most likely blizz will just delete or mark yours for rename. Those streamers are too big of an advertisement tool and community outreach.
---
Yikes
---
I am pretty sure it was Katrana Prestor who orchestrated the whole Stonemasons scandal. Not that the rest of the Stormwind nobles are guilt-free, but Katrana is not exactly what one might consider your... average human.
---
We have yet to decide on factions lol, picking classes would be a dream at this point!
---
I mean yeah, but you still need to be dedicated to the guild, your not getting it by showing up to half the raids unprepared.
---
Please don't use words just to try and sound smart. This is a discussion about differences in opinion, specifically relating to when greed justifies a behavior change. The market value is irrelevant to me. If Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros were BOE drop and could be sold for 1,000,000g (btw that's more than a character can even hold in Classic), I would still advocate for only allowing those that were going to equip and use it to roll.
---
You make a good point I made this in a rush and I could be wrong but doing the starter zones take you upto honored so they would have way less cloth to turn in over starting from neutral.
---
Sounds like overhandlin' there.
---
Druids actually have way more flavor. They can enter the emerald dreamway now which has portals to moonglade and all the nature focused zones. They also have a toy they can get in moonglade that teleports them to a random place of nature in azeroth. Underwater form is actually useful for quests in retail. The one annoying thing for druids is them having 4 talent trees instead of 3 because blizz buffed bear and cat so much that they had to be seperate or it wouldn't be fair to rogues and druids.
---
The flavor druids really lost in retail was their feral tree being jack of all trades, master of none. You were never better than either a protection warrior or a rogue, but you were always a better rogue than any warrior and vice versa.
---
&gt; they require you to have an active subscription
---
Because without subscription it would make no sense at all. 
---
You can be sure there would be people creating tens if not hundreds accounts to reserve as many names as they please. It would be free after all
---
Loved reading this, i’m rolling a Druid in Classic for the first time and i’m super excited about it! I feel like there is a lot of Druid hype going around which is so great to see considering i’ve heard for a long time ‘druids are the weakest class’.
---
P.s. I think you could make a really successful YouTube series out of this for classic and the other expansions and potentially for Classic+ if it ever happens!
---
Sure
---
I find it hard to believe that any good tank would let a dps die just because they pulled aggro. It is literally your job to pick up aggro when a dps pulls it. Taunt is SUPER reliable, sure it might not work 1/10 times but if you’re not marking and making the kill target obvious to begin with you’re probably bad at your job, just like how the dps is bad at not assisting - the difference is the dps can actually kill the mobs and is far more important the efficiency and speed of the group. 
---
As a healer I would rather heal good dps than a bad tank any day.
---
Y’all treat this shit like it’s early EQ and taunt was garbage. Tanking in WoW is not any harder than being a dps in classic, all the *hard* learning required for tanking you can put in before doing the actual dungeon.
---
Tldr: if you think it’s too hard or annoying to pick up tauntable mobs that dps pull you should go back to 1999 and play on the Everquest tlps where you barely have to look at your screen to be effective.
---
Yup. Plus boes tend to be more rare items. Even if it doesn't benefit your class the ability to sell it and use that money to buy a boe you actually want. 
---
I think what the back and forth arguments in this thread on BOEs has really shown me is that I really want to find a guild so I can avoid these kind of arguments
---
i remember there being an addon that told you where the soul came from. useful for trophies like ears in d2
---
The Paladin Discord is huge and also mostly theorycrafting ways to improve their DPS/TPS (for the Rets and Prots, respectively). I've used their spreadsheets for multiple other specs because they're so dang thorough. It would be nice for them to be on the list there, but I don't think any of the guys who put together that Discord have really done much research on the current Pally situation (you'll notice there's not even a Paladin section under "tanking").
---
If I'm thinking of the right one, is that the Comix add on?? I remember it would play a lot of old cartoon songs between zones, spring noises when you jumped, and big ***BAM!*** and ***WOOSH!*** animations when you landed crits. I was in love with it and will install before anything else if it's supported for Classic.
---
You can go fury warrior to benefit from axes
---
The point is you don't even join the guild, as a shaman/paladin, unless shaman and paladin get priority on the weapon.
---
I don't know about dinging 60 quickly, but I do have plans once I get there. Farming gold for work mount and leveling professions. Then farming pre-raid BiS to get ready for raiding.
---
I Definitely didn't think about it like that but you're probably right. I've set aside tons of time in the first two weeks of release to go ape shit playing it so hopefully it'll be easily manageable after that.
---
I play bfa and I believe classic might seriously overtake it in numbers.  
---
  Retail just aint the same
---
Alliance will deadass fuck over the elven refugees and then talk about honor. Lmao
---
If you’re asking if you have to physically log into the game, or can just go thru the website to reserve the names we’re not sure. 
---
But Classic and retail are bundled into one price, so you only need to pay one sub for both games.
---
They could also have gated the battlegroup system. You know?
---
Didn't notice your comment before I seconded the same thing. +1 for Comix and everything it's done for us.
---
Am I the only one that's sad that things like this exist for PvP?
---
guild banks; better UI/profession/AH windows; more guild management options and tools; improved mail
---
TBC classes are waaaaaaaaaay better.
---
Meanwhile the tauren are content to just not be murdered by centaur.
---
classes don't really feel special in classic.
---
most specializations are trash and not even viable in meaningful content.
---
if you just want to RP, yah sure, whatever.
---
So hyped to still my shithead, ex-GMs name. Not even gonna play on his server but I can’t wait to send him a picture of it. Maybe he’ll pay me for it?
---
I fully agree. Outland made sense, and as a stand alone expansion, would have been fine. It was literally another world and they could have hand-waved flying being possible due to gravity or whatever due to Outland literally falling apart in to space. The problem was that they continued doing this for every new expansion. While Northrend *was* apart of Azeorth, they made the Vanilla content irrelevant.
---
Ironically, they tried to fix this in Cata by changing up the old world. Problem is, it was basically only 1-60 and new zones randomly tossed in that you LITERALLY teleported to. Blizzard needed to make the old zones relevant but instead they kept forgetting they existed and we got left with an empty world with the exception of the new zones in every new expansion.
---
This is the community that is upset that they can be reported for bad behavior now.  Of course they'll be toxic.
---
Legit had no idea you had to get a key for UBRS the end game hype is growing!
---
But if you don’t want long queue times, you will want to be on the underdog faction, hopefully evening out the percentages
---
3 chars per account? Where is it written
---
Are you sure there are ranks in phase 1? I was under the impression that there will be no credit for HK’s until phase 2?
---
Will be on stress test, won't be at launch unless I don't get to sleep (I'd like to start early next morning).
---
Lmfao dude it clearly IS a problem. The fact that some specs are called "meme specs" proves this.
---
Region: NA
---
Server: PvP
---
Faction: Alliance or Horde (either)
---
Class: Fury Warrior
---
Raid availability: Open
---
Looking for: Hardcore with dungeon leveling at start (Long push at start, many hours per day)
---
Experience: Heroic ICC
---
After going through the Beta I check linked Alliance guides for Classic accuracy based on 2 quests that have different requirements than private servers
---
* **Bounty on Murlocs from Guard Thomas in Elwynn:** This quest is level 7 on most pservers so almost every guide includes it in the eastvale quest hub but on the Beta it had a level 10 requirement which means it wasn’t doable with that group of quests. Your guide doesn’t include this quest in the eastvale hub which is a good sign, hopefully it wasn’t just coincidental
---
* **Seasoned Wolf Kaboobs from Chef Grual in Duskwood:** This quest requires 50 cooking which most people who are power leveling won’t have as there’s very little incentive to spend extra time leveling cooking when leveling asap. Any guides that include this without noting the cooking requirements is probably basing their guide off pservers
---
Based on those above I’m not exactly sure if your guide is based off pservers or Classic Beta but it’s seems like a good guide regardless.
---
That being said I leveled all the way to 33 on the Beta on Alliance and the Beta quests lined up pretty well with my guide with very few issues so even guides that are based off pservers should server people well. The only thing I’d warn is that XP values might not be exact so you have to include grind sections if actual Classic XP doesn’t line up with where guides say you should. This will specifically impact quest availability because there are lots of hubs you’ll get to in a guide that require the specified level in the guide to obtain.
---
Definitely interested in this. 90% of guilds are not going to survive the first month. Getting a lot of similar people together on the same server is a good idea.
---
No we didn't.
---
Go pally tank and affliction lock wombo combo elite speed leveling. mage also works.
---
Also why not play a PvP server? Your going to be duo leveling which means you'll win lots of engagements. . . until they cry for their 60 friends to find you.
---
Ah man some of them were so nice though. You're right, it did hurt smaller guilds perhaps, but as the owner of a level 25 guild for most of Cata... it was really nice.
---
Hey, I happen to quite like Un'Goro Crater, thank you very much.

Wish there was some kind of deterrent for ganking people 10+ levels lower than you. Like it added a 10 min CD to your hearthstone or gave you some kind moral debuff. Basically to stop you from griefing lowbies. Or a ghost of the lowbie followed you around and cursed you constantly idk.
---
Why? She seems like your average politician.
---
Please explain where I backpedaled? What goalpost did I move? The point has been and still is that if someone wants to equip and use a BOE item for any reason they should roll need and others roll greed. I am not the one adding qualifiers at every turn (i.e. is the item valuable, are they a twink character, is it BiS, etc).

Well it is what it is, the next wallpaper hopefully will be an improvement. It's my first time using only adobe illustrator and vector art.
---
Classic!
---
One of the best parts of vanilla and  TBC for me was the server forums  community. Talking shit to each other etc.
---
Also one of the reasons why we cant have Shard 23, Layer 6 BS  in classic :( Imagine going on the forums and seeing someone talk about the happenings at goldshire last  night and you were literally on goldshire, on the same server, in the same place... and didnt get to see what your community is discussing.
---
My point was just that one of the most immervice thing in vanilla is knowing people from your server and battlegroup / cross realm dungeons is what killed that in the end.
---
You can agree or disagree but that still one of the main thing people enjoyed about vanilla : the community. Realm forums were a prime example of that.
---
&gt; And it was death by a thousand cuts 
---
Nail on the fucking head
---
The "grind" in vanilla involved the most part of a MMO (hint it's the 2nd M), it was multiplayer.  You met people, you grouped up, you kept a friends list.  It's not just press 1 button to q for dungeon then spam aoe until everything is dead.
---
It actually does not (imo).
---
Neither race are purely good or evil :O
---
You guys must have played on the lowest pop realm ever because I never had to wait 12 hours to enter WSG.

&gt; Dont know about undeads tho.

---
Ya check under the Galstaff post
---
That's really only when you outgear the dungeon and the group is good. You can easily gain enough threat if you're in blues with an average DPS group. But it's true once you get raiding gear.
---
They won’t have any 60 friends... we intend on staying with the pack. The fact that it’s a fresh environment reducing the likelihood of being ganked may have swayed her on the pvp server aspect.
---
I thought missed moves waste the energy but don't consume the combo points? Might be my memory being a but hazy, but that's the feeling I get. Haven't played a rogue since original vanilla.
---
The problem is that your bags will be constantly full. I could see this backfiring pretty quick.
---
I agree should have been at least contained in the outlands.
---
Calling somebody else dense while at the same time confusing "your" and "you're".
---
Incredible. df

I dunno. Shooting from the hip there. I saw the phase list in passing the other day.

When an RPG get diluted to "press buttons and then ... slot machine"

Launchpads are usually used by DJs and similar kind of persons. But with some neat piece of software, called LPHK from Github, you can convert it to a really great hotkey launcher with 80 buttons. This should be enough for all circumstances.

Seriously, the Orcs imprisoned in Lordaeron should be thankful they weren't summarily executed at the end of the war. It's exactly what the Orcs would have done and were, in fact, doing to the Draenei back home.
---
Stop usung that god damn word and define it. Is being slightly confrontative toxic? Is it toxic when you don't want to play with someone who doesn't know what they're doing? What about trying to joun groups, and then beung silent
---
Players like whitegrape go to redridge because it's littered with people who are lvl 15-20 so it's fun to terrorize. People get mad but as an antiganker it gives me so much content and fun, it's like a BG for me where my goal is to hunt down rogues. Sucks for hte lowbies tho for sure, especially with the escort quest because even if I'm there they can still kill him faster than I can autoattack them to death lol
---
Yeah, people discuss 'meme specs' *in terms of WoW Classic*
---
If you'll recall, **I** have been talking about TBC this entire time, which I held up as a model for a pretty good  level of balance between pures and hybrids.
---
You need to be wearing a helmet.
---
You can feasibly tank or heal any dungeon before level 50 as a paladin specced anything as long as you got a shield, consecrate, and your group isn’t filled with idiots.

Nah. If kids can't hang like it was in 2004, they can go back to Fortnite. I'll say whatever I want.

---
Thanks!  I thought about doing the YouTube thing, but I have very little in either the talent or the patience to make and edit videos.  Maybe one day...
---
And I feel you with the druid hype.  I think it has something to do with all the classic content being put out.  The more info that gets out there the more people realize how some of their assumptions were wrong.  Like I said before, if you didn't play a druid, or were directly affected by the druid changes (lol mages) then you might not ever have realized how good or bad they actually were.
---
&gt;because your role in the raid sucks
---
It's a game. If you don't enjoy what you do, do something else.
---
Don't expect to be rewarded for choosing to do something you don't find enjoyable.
---
I'm not particularly opposed to your conclusion, but your reasoning is bonkers.
---
Gotta grind out my Arcanite Reaper HOOOOOOOOO!!!!1

Nothing, just some cheapskates being cheap.
---
Why do I need a separate cook? Mom is perfectly capable of bringing a hot plate of tendies down the basement stairs.
---
No, but healers don't get gear during prog usually because tanks and DPS are more important for clearning bosses.
---
Bigger heals than necessary doesnt kill a boss faster and safer, but bigger dps will.
---
I saw a lot of that same question asked and answered, but you worded it the best.
---
I don't know if this counts, but my parents told me if I ever used /yell the "Stormwind Police" would come and arrest me. I have no idea why they told me that, I guess so I wouldn't use it to spam? But I still never used /yell until like wotlk or cata.
---
&gt;I said "as soon as they come out." Can you read?
---
Nowhere in your original comment is this said you fucking troglodyte.
---
"OK so it was in 1 patch out of 12. Shouldn't really be the norm for classic IMO as it takes out a lot of the immersion and life from a server. Nothing feels better than getting to know your enemies in the outside world and meet them in WSG. Or face your rival guild etc."
---
You adding on to your retard spew after realizing you said some stupid shit doesnt erase your original retardation.
---
&gt;Anyway, have fun, you'll be back to bfa in 2 months waiting for LFR queues in whatever capital they created this expansion, not even saying hi to XXXARTHASXXX when he joins the group the game made for you because you can't be bothered trying to assemble a party 
---
The fuck you spewing retard lol?
---
I'm not even for cross realm BGs but your argument was retarded and you appear to be retarded as well and it needed to be poked full of holes and thus was.
---
gg bub
---
I’m absolutely going to try to get a Thex on a server. It won’t ever be my main though. I have some vanilla nostalgia vibes to live out so I’m sticking to the same names and everything.
---
How am I supposed to sell naming rights to Thex if I can only reserve on 3 servers?
---
I think my point is that IT'S NOT YOUR PLACE TO DECIDE WHAT OTHERS THINK IS WORTH IT.
---
I can't believe we're actually having this discussion. That's like arguing that $100k cars shouldn't exist because YOU would never pay that much for one. I wouldn't either.... But I would never attempt to tell someone they're wrong in valuing one that much, i.e. buying one.
---
Get the hell outta here with this illogical nonsense.
---
Fear of missing out won't MAKE anyone do anything. You always have a choice. No one is making me sign up early so I can do the stress test and get the name I want. I'm CHOOSING to do it because I WANT TO.
---
Probably a catababy.
---
&gt;So I really hope Blizz does some different balancing this time around to make these specs viable for end game raiding so not everyone is pigeon holed into one spec per class for raiding.
---
It's not going to happen.
---
That its not released yet.
---
Keep in mind, the Warlock usually won't be the one initiating the WPVP. This means that they will be much more vulnerable than in a dueling scenario if they don't happen to have the correct prep done eg. Healthstones, soulstone, and the correct demon. If the player attacking the Warlock is good, they stand a decent chance, despite Warlocks being very strong 1v1 class. Most, and I really mean most, players are not good and can't take advantage of these factors. So, in a world where everyone plays perfectly, Warlocks are no longer 'S' tier at WPVP (still A or B), but since most people suck, odds are you will be pretty successful in WPVP. That's my experience anyway.

To be fair though, "classic" players had their mmo turn into something they consider shit, with retail players not having to experience amything of the sort
---
Played a human rogue and after completing the class quest in westfall, got a debuff called Touch of Zanzil. It lowers agility, prevents you from stealthing, and kills you after 7 days. For some reason I thought that when you died from it that it would be a permanent death and your character would be deleted. I know there is a quest to cure you but I was extremely green and didnt know where to get any of those parts. 
---
For days I was panicking bc I thought my rogue was gonna be permanently killed. I tried asking for help in chat but every response was, just do the quest, being laughed at when I asked where to get said items for quest, or getting sent on wild goose chases.
---
With minutes left I made a final plea in trade chat for help. I got a whisper from someone asking if this was about the rogue quest debuff, I said yes. They asked where I was and I said at the  Rogue Trainers area where you turn in the quest. Told me to wait there and he would help me. I thought he was going to bring me the mats for the quest but in just strolls a pally that uses purify on me and then walks away. I tried to give him all the money I had at the time, less than 20s, bc in my eyes he just saved my character from deletion. He denied compensation and said it was no big deal.
---
It took many years and two expansions for me to realize how dumb I was.
---
This was not my experience in retail TBC. Still had to grind a LOT just to get normal flying.
---
That's basically my guild - I don't care much about min/max. As long as the raid team can work together and overcome obstacles, I don't care about doing it faster or more effectively. I just want to conquer challenges with a community of people that I genuinely like.

They're also great for making soundboards.
---
In what fucking way is this a scam? There is nothing underhanded about this, there is no deception. If you have an active WoW sub you can reserve a Classic character early, that's it.  It's a bonus for people who are subbed. If you don't want to sub yet, then don't.
---
Oh, I won't. I can understand people emphasizing the end game where the best rewards are, though.
---
And yeah, every class can raid. I've been in very few raids, ever, where we didn't have  at least 1 of every class. And that was just sheer luck (our druids can't make it today). I'm leaning a lot more towards your side, honestly.
---
and the other guy says pallies, the best pvp healers in the game, suck at bgs.I don't want to be on his side lol.
---
Just look at all those comments! This will be great!
---
I love flying in mmos, personally. 
---
It does break the immersion, and the whole idea of meeting people traveling through the world, plus this can make a lot of areas dead.
---
I just don't care much about the downsides. But for most people the downside is to much.
---
STRENGTH AND HONOR
---
It's not about who gets gimped harder no question.
---
He just stated that it's wrong to say the problem goes only one way. It's just mostly one way. :P
---
I hear ya brother. No matter what anyone says I know I'm going to get addicted to classic wow. I am married,  work fulltime and have a baby girl who is almost 2. Whenever I'm on the computer for too long my baby will start trying to get my attention and be super cute. All she wants is to be with me. That's going to keep me grounded for sure. With correct time management I believe putting quality time into family AND classic wow is very possible. 
---
Side note: my guitar practice is probably going to suffer lol..
---
Make sure you pick the spec you want to play and dont respec until closer to 60. It will save you a lot of gold later!! 
---
I gimped my talents on my first playthrough and with all the costs like water being super expensive, mount costs (unless pally/warlock), skill costs, and repair costs adding up you wont have any gold for respects after the 2nd one so choose carefully.
---
Adding to that, it was also present in the beta/stress tests, and is how low level characters were getting tens of gold. The quests they completed at the artificial level cap was granting them the bonus gold.
---
Deep wounds (and weapon proc dots) will be pushed off by almost anything worth having. Although god help the warrior who whirlwinds next to the sheeped target on Majordomo and gets a crit. That guy has upset me too many times.
---
You don’t interact with players or the world when you are flying above it.
---
Waow you say retarded a lot, grats for being ableist love. Anyway, enjoy your night.
---
I sincerely hope they launch a second set of servers and don't convert classic over. I want a permanent classic with -maybe- expanded content, not any expansion.
---
More exp from dungeon elites in classic than psever. Might as well get some exp while you are there.
---
I pay for retail anyway. It's just a bonus for people who have game time. It's not like you hafta buy it. If the name you want is taken just hit up a random name generator and just pick the first thing you can pronounce.
---
my buddy thought that priest's fade made them invisible for its duration. he showed me how it worked by running through mobs then dying.
---
Essentially deleting a character in one 'global', aka one-shotting someone (usually more than one ability, though). An example is old "swifty one-shot macro" videos.
---
I was such a noob back in vanilla and I loved going on the Turalyon forums to see what all the server cool kids were up to.
---
Because the grind is easier to do when you make friends along the way
---
It's actually a fact that everyone needs gold.
---
I for one will enjoy those who think like you who will cry at half the playerbase for "ninja looting" and promptly being told you're wrong.
---
Because there is nothing to ensure the player who "needs" the item will actually use it and not just resell it.
---
If you want a Staff of Jordan at a lower level, guess what? You can hope your /roll wins you the item or you can buy it yourself.
---
Well shit, I need to join his guild. They’ll pay for my mount too because I shouldn’t have to pay for that shit 😂😂
---
This is a sexy idea
---
All need boe epics.
---
No exceptions.
---
Not even stockades for the tank.
---
We all have prebis to buy/craft.
---
Sorry not sorry.
---
Half a month of subscription cost, since it's 14 days in advance of launch. Sure, you can play BFA, but for those that don't intend to, it's effectively $7 to reserve names.
---
Oh please... Until Thrall the Horde's greatest hero was Grom, who was only SOMETIMES a genocidal maniac as opposed to being ALWAYS a genocidal maniac.
---
I used to use one of these to communicate in PUBG. It was possibly too much fun.
---
I played so much PvP in TBC and resto Druids were probably the hardest class to kill.
---
Challenge accepted
---
Yes, inspecting one's gear and determining for yourself their worth/value for any type of role you may consider playing with them for.
---
Why is that funny?   These mats really aren't worth that much to the guild.   The point of the guild is to get epics for the guild.
---
We all want thex

Now I feel bad. I need to act more mature in the World of Warcraft.

---
&lt;plaGue&gt; is a large **german speaking** group of friends that have been playing WoW on and off since Vanilla. With every reentry to WoW we have rebuilt the guild and raidteam, growing our group to a community of skilled raiders always curious of what new stuff WoW has to offer. We have a wide range of people, from old &lt;For the Horde&gt; raiders, all the way to world rank 1000 players.
---
With an experienced Leadership, who has raided in Vanilla up to and including Naxx, our number one goal is to build a community that enjoys spending the evening together, while clearing the raid content in a timely fashion.
---
We are recruiting chill experienced raiders, looking to have a good time. Lacking experience in Vanilla is no problem, as long as you have decent raiding experience in any expansion.
---
Currently our raiding roster is getting close to 40 people, but still has room for any dedicated player of any class. We are aiming at an active raiding roster of 50-60 people, to ensure a smooth experience for all of our raiders.

**[EU Alliance German] 5 man dungeon leveling group**
---
**Our goal**
---
We want push to max level in the first 7 days of the launch. The majority of our exp will come through grinding instances, 
---
while also doing certain quests/quest hubs along the way. 
---
You can check out this video for a ruff understanding of how we will level: youtu.be/GXPu3jEZ0-I 
---
We have done our own optimizations to that route.
---
We are a group of 4 friends that have all been playing wow since around TBC. 
---
Some of us have focused more on raiding, achieving multiple realm firsts and world top 100 ranks, while others have focused more on optimizing the leveling part of the game.
---
We are looking for a chill and experienced player, looking to have a good time.
---
Currently our group roster consists of:
---
- Warrior Tank
---
- Priest Heal
---
- Warrior DPS
---
- Mage
---
We are looking for 1 dedicated player. Class preference would be a Warlock, but other classes will also be considered, since the person playing is the more important part.
---
**Play Times:**
---
Launch day: 00:00 - 22:00 CET
---
All further days: 08:00 - 00:00 CET

The tuf gaming X570 WiFi. I’m pretty noob to building. I picked it because there were a few YouTube guys that liked it and it had WiFi and support for the gen 3 architecture.
---
I even offered to give them one as I was an enchanted and they were like 25-30g or so. Nope, better for the guild to nexus it!
---
Make azeroth great again! FOR THE HORDE!
---
There’s really no constructive complaining to be had though. Classic is a time capsule. It has elements that are outstanding, way better than retail,  but it also has those issues that I mentioned above and those issues can’t be changed (at least not in the current classic timeline) because then it wouldn’t be classic anymore. 
---
I personally am in the “keep classic going after Naxx but balance some classes and add new content.” Not to the point of homogenizing the classes, but give every role some reason to be brought, even if it’s not for pure DPS.
---
might be hard to be an off-tank without a taunt
---
I followed your playlist man, just keep updating it :) gotta love some mid 00s metal/rock!
---
Be honest, how many of you guys are using your slots to reserve the name Thex?
---
pretty much the only spec that's gonna be new to the meta is tank warlock, less of everything else min/max 2 strong
---
I think the Forsaken priests still use the Light, since there are several Forsaken NPCs in the lore who were former priests / paladins of Lordaeron. I also remember reading something about how using the Light causes undead priests extreme pain.
---
So ur gonna take ur hand off the wasd n go all the way over there and use those keys?
---
 ... really? If we assume everyone actually uses all three reservation slots, that means at least 2/3 of their data points are nothing more than potential alts to be played WAY down the line
---
And what good would releasing that info do anyways? "OH SHIT SKULLCRUSHER, MY CHOSEN REALM, is 53/47 ALLIANCE! I BETTER SELECT A DIFFERENT SERVER FOR MY HORDE TOON!" and boom, a 53/47 server turns into a 70/30 server before gameplay even starts.
---
Across the board, the faction split is damn near perfect, which is super impressive design on Blizzard's part. Most realm inequality arises over time and would be essentially impossible to predict.
---
1. gnomes and humans have it easy to meet up at. The deep run tram connects their capital cities. Though it would probably be better to spend the first hour leveling to 5 or 6 and head in your cities with a fedex quest and then meet up.
---
2. I thought there was a 10% penalty (still much better to duo level), but I asked Kargoz (horde streamer) to test it early in the beta on his stream and his obliged. Did not see any penalty.
---
3. There are places where instance grinding can be faster. Scarlet monastery is the go to example. Since there are 3 dungeons that can be done one after the other. BRD as well.
---
4. Joanna's solo WR is like 116 hours. you should pace yourselves.
---
For the same crowd I'd like to add something else: Always finish your vegetables.
---
False.
---
&gt;for the guild
---
I know, in retrospect, that flying mounts caused a lot of problems and removed tension from the world. The game would probably have been better without them. 
---
But god it was epic playing TBC at launch when you first got a flying mount. I was one of the first of my friends to get one and it was the ultimate flex for a few days just to whip out the mount and start flapping around while they were forced to obey gravity like a bunch of peasants.
---
The DPS #s were closer in wrath, sure. But by then all the utility had been made raid wide and often didn't stack with other raid buffs of similar types, effectively eliminating the niche aspect of utility classes. 
---
Which, again, was my original point. That TBC was the best example we have of hybrids being close enough in dps (when factoring in the DPS their buffs provide), while still providing unique things that made them attractive. 
---
You keep trying to argue other points. I never said you should or shouldn't take a warlock over a priest. Just that if you did take a priest, you'd at least get something noteworthy to work with that would help your raid--mana for your healers or mages. Also Shadow Weaving to help your other warlocks. Just like when you put in an enhance shaman, he wont do as much damage as a rogue or warrior, but he'll grant wf to them which will be close enough while remaining an interesting choice.
---
Ohh no, I posed an interesting ethical question on another sub.  What a monster!!
---
Needing for greed. So dumb. No one wants to think anymore so instead of considering of someone actually needs everyone needs. Hate this so much.
---
My wife still had level 1 food when she hit 60. I was wondering why she never had bag space even though I bought her 16 slot bags. So I logged on and saw she had grey items and low level food. She kept it cuz she didn't want to waste it lol.
---
I dont care much about whose side anyone is on, but people here keep parroting this stupid nonsense about druids being horrible at everything, that "meme specs" cant raid etc. Like even top guilds in vanilla had meme specs, and they did just fine.. doing 500 less dps is not why your guild is stuck on Vael lol
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Like someone said, wait for Burning Crusade Classic.  2 years maybe?
---
Why do you think that the quickfix version won't work on its own?
---
4-5 tanks for BWL. 5 tanks and 3 tanks for MC stuff. plenty of off-tank positions
---
This is for the guild.  Even if all it does is help you farm gold, it helps the guild.
---
As a mage you are constantly going to be spamming abilities in pve, non-stop. Rogue hits ability buttons far less often. Energy regenerates very slowly pre-wrath, so even if you spam sinister strike, you are waiting like 5 sec before you even have energy to use it again, once energy gets to zero.
---
But dont spam abilities as rogue. All of your rogue abilities cost energy, so you need to have energy to use abilities like kick or blind.
---
Warlock is MUCH stronger in 1.12 then in other patches so maybe that counts.
---
I'm sorry but as a typical Warrior I pressed Ctrl+F, typed "Warrior" felt good and commented this.
---
No, my argument is that prior to Naxx there was no reason to gear up 8 tanks.  Did warriors have pieces here and there?  Sure.  Were they geared for the highest raid content in the game at that time?  Fuck no, not even close.  A hodge podge of gear from here and there does not make one viable for that content.

##**⭐️Who is Nostalgia?⭐️**
---
Nostalgia is a small and efficient group looking for players who are interested in all endgame content. We all have played Vanilla and other expansions and are excited to relive the experience in a more relaxed and efficient manner. We are not looking for hardcore elitists - just friendly and dedicated individuals that want to finish end game content and have a good time while doing so.
---
##**⭐️Who are we looking for?⭐️**
---
- If you’ve never been in a guild, we welcome you to have us as your first.
---
- If you’ve never played WoW before you’ll have 60 levels plus our support to figure it out ;)  
---
- If you’re a die hard veteran who’s farmed every raid and done it all you’re more than welcome too. 
---
- Our goal is **Quality over Quantity**, **Maximum Efficiency**, and **Good Vibes**. If this speaks your language welcome to Nostalgia. 
---
- We are currently recruiting **all roles** Except Hunter but definitely need more DPS such as Warriors, Mages, Rogues, etc.
---

Thanks for the response!
---
Hello my name is Afzari and I’m an altaholic
---
Bring laptop to class.
---
Bit of a bold claim there but I really think people are underselling the potential of this game. Not only are there tens of millions of people that played wow in its prime that might want to return, there are probably others that want to try the game famous for ruining lives. Retail isn’t that, but classic is. If the game gets popular with teens (it did before, it could again), forget about it. I don’t expect the game to blow up that big, but I won’t be surprised if it did.
---
&gt;Which makes me suspect that this name reservation is just usual limit of 50 characters per account lowered to 3 and without possibility of entering game world.
---
Well, yeah, of course. It's the simplest way to do it.
---
Wasn't there a popular mace stun spec at one time?
---
As a healer I still don't understand most of the raid boss mechanics.  Stay out of the fire, decurse when needed, play whack-a-mole on my raid frames.  Going DPS this time around, so looking forward to actually seeing what I'm killing.
---
I imagine those will be added closer to launch. I don't see why they wouldnt have them
---
&gt; Not if you want Rank 14
---
Rank 14 is a job.
---
Also to add for number 4, the range is anywhere from 80 hours (fastest possible time-solo hunter) to 240 hours (casual, slow, lore-based, adventurous, etc player). An average player running a guide will usually have 5-6 days, or 120-150 hours. That’s purely levelling. If you want to pvp and do other things it’s going to be closer to the 10 day mark, or 240hrs. I would say, pace yourself and enjoy the game, there is TONS of content for every level range after level 10, so don’t rush through it if it’s your first time.
---
Yeah that's pretty OP.  Crazy what went through the devs heads back then.
---
That sounds great, especially about the lack of CDs required.
---
There is also like zero reason to be solo killing mobs at level 60.
---
My plan is to continue reading/watching class breakdowns waiting for that one sign in the sand that makes me decide.
---
Then on release day make a new character on a whim and accidentally make it my main
---
I dont have the exp table handy but its 50% for two people and I think 33% for 3.  It goes down from there with a slight bonus to total exp when you hit 4 and 5.
---
If you want to do it I encourage it.  Some loot quests will be a pain in the ass but if you're all okay with taking it easy it will be a shit load of fun to be on voice chat together especially if you take the time to head to the same starting zone.
---
Gnomes have an easy enough path to ironforge and the tram to SW.  You can even get through it lazily with 2 deaths max
---
I plan to have a twink in each bracket except 59, and if I level an alt to 60 it will do a good chunk of the rank grind at 59, as getting to rank 10 is quite doable there and less painful later in the phases.  49 is my true love in the twinking brackets, but it’s not always the most active range so I plan to have options, and use my main to fund them.  I have low interest in raiding, and lots of interest in pvp.
---
I was looking into it before this post but looking more closely with so many asking. I think it might be possible in an ordinate amount of work with how I've developed the site but will require some time.
---
I'm doing my part
---
I disagree. I don't think the recent lvl 40 1v1 tournament is fully representative.
---
If my memory serves right at 60 and geared it was frost mages dominating the battlegrounds. 
---
1v1 was probably Warlock or Shadow Priest though.
---
Not sure why this is getting downvoted. It's actually a good question.  
---
According to [wowwiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Qiraji_Resonating_Crystal) and elsewhere on the internet it seems like this mount was usable while in combat (however one had to be out of combat before the cast finished in order to mount up). This wasn't fixed untill patch 3.0.3 (WotLK).  
---
Also it seems that this mount was useable while falling, and could in fact be cast instantly but only if you were already mounted. This was fixed in patch 2.2.0 (TBC).  
---
   
---
If Blizzard are going all in on the #nochanges then I guess we can expect these things as well.
---
Wow Classic will be even worse I'm afraid, because it's harder than mop right now, dungeons take more time, and every mistake will be more costly. Thats why I made a post like this , but it probably won't stop peoplee.
---
my god, not using wasd to move?? in CLASSIC???? #NOCHANGES
---
Because warlocks could learn swords, they were meant to weild them in melee against stuff.  
---
Combo points were too complicated to deal with as a rogue, I'm just going to deal damage.  
---
all purple gear is created equal, and obviously should immediately be equipped, regardless of stats and level.
---
Which should take maybe 1 weekend of playing in between all other chores.
---
This game is a fuckin joke in its current state.
---
They’re absolutely not useless everywhere else. By the end of Naxx they’re the best healers, their buffs are incredible (But extremely annoying to constantly be buffing everyone with them), and they’re the best PvP healer. That’s not to say they don’t have issues. Ret is a meme in raids, Prot is even a bigger meme in raids, and they basically auto attack their way to 60
---
Like I told another redditor (whom I have since blocked as he offered very little in the sense of constructive argument) :
---
I never said druids were perfect.  But they are a lot better than people give them credit.
---
My group of friends most likely will be as well.  It's important for me to find ab early morning weekend raiding group though, which is much easier to find joining an EU guild/server.
---
first stealth you can learn is lvl 32 in hillsbrad
---
\&gt; Properly specced   
---
5/5 spirit tap  
---
Wand  
---
Done.
---
Server identity isn't useless. Having a name that you have always gone by is very important.
---
God it's been too long since I've heard any Senses Fail
---
I won't be in the stress test or the name reserve rush because I'd just be wasting half a month of subscription time until the 26th.  Nobody would take my char's names so I'm not worried at all.
---
You can use it for multiple things. In fps, I use it for a dpi shift, so I can drop dpi and steady my aim for longer shots / sniping.  In regards to wow I use it in place of a ctrl modifier, as I play on a laptop and reaching ctrl is kind of weird.
---
Don't worry, I'll get to warlocks soon.
---
We outnumber them....? By what metric? With what proof?
---
I'll believe Classic has greater than 3 million players when I see it. Not until then.
---
This is an EXCELLENT video on threat, highly recommend for everyone to watch.  
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=pQqgcm82IFE
---
I think it's only really a problem for prot warriors. Repairs are insane for plate and prot spec farming is agonizingly slow. If you have a decent guild they'll farm for you, but if not than it sucks.
---
Well, at least he didn't OOM.
---
hey this cuddly with benevolent elephants, you reached out to me on disc but it is not allowing me to reply to your direct message because we are not on a shared server.
---
Fuck yes haha. Thex will be my Bank alt
---
My earliest memories from WoW was when I was around 5, leveling fishing for my dad bc he hated it + farming leather for him while he was at work. (We played a PVE server so didn’t have to worry about ganking). Had a toon on his account until I turned 7 and got my own account (right before BC launched).
---
If I remember correctly, I didn’t pay attention to story or anything of the sorts. I understood basic game mechanics though. Could find my way through the world, could figure out most quests, could run all dungeons up to ZF, spent A LOT of time farming mats/tradeskilling, understood how AH/factions/PvP battlegrounds worked. Was a very slow leveler (for obvious reasons) but got my rogue up to max level every expansion until Cata, which launched when I was 11 (130 days played on that character lol). My first raid was ZG at 9 years old.
---
So kids can definitely grasp the game. I was far from being good but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Playing WoW with my dad and doing BC quests for the first time is one of the fondest moments of my entire childhood. Hope things go just as well for you!
---
 PvP monsters later on as Ele how are Shamans in 1v1/wPvP they seem like they're just damage cannons in BGs
---
Same with rogue.
---
hyperbole for effect
---
I was always going Druid (for an alt{as if I have a main lol})
---
As I get older I try really hard not to be that person that just say's oh X used to be so much better everything sucks now or the way this generation says or does things is so stupid or ridiculous. I look at how my parents behaved and my grandparents when confronted with something new whether it was a new procedure for something or technology or language or fad or really any change. They met it with ignorance embarrassment frustration hatred and ridicule.  
---
I refuse to do be that old man and I think more people should think about that when they start looking down on things they find silly or stupid that are new.
---
\*Tips fedora\*
---
Only alliance are going to queue for that clusterfuck
---
That is kind of a limitation of mobile browsing experience. The best way I've found to do it on mobile is hold the link until the tooltip shows up. Another menu pops up from my browser but i can click away from it and the tooltip is still there. So it's possible to see the tooltips but not 100% pleasant. I don't know of a better way to get the tooltips working on mobile atm. I'll think and research about what options there are.
---
That video was posted in 2007.
---
The way I see it, as long as a meta vs non-meta raid are clearing the content, it doesn't matter.
---
All this stuff about guilds stacking world buffs, consumable buffed out of their mind.  They're blowing potentially a couple hundred gold a raid for buffs, all to save a few hours, all of which that time saved could have been farming.
---
Like, let's say you farm 50g/hr, but going full consumes on a raid is buff time (i.e. lost farming time if you have to log out of your main to maintain buffs) and lost gold for consumes.  If I'm spending 200g to consume up for a raid, then I better be shaving 4+ hours off my clear time.  
---
Sure, that time could be spent clearing more raid content as well like a back to back MC/BWL clear as well.
---
But either way, my guild is going to try out some meme shit.  There are some stuff my vanilla guild didn't do like double and triple pulling MC bosses that I want to try out.
---
If I wanted to go full try hard, I'd go find a guild for that, but I'm not really wanting to do that.  In the end, we all get 1 raid clear a week.  Doesn't matter if it takes 1 hour or 10 hours.  Loot output is the same from the raids.
---
The first time I did it was within a week of Vanilla release and it took me like 2 hours of swimming around off the coast to find the item. The second time I did it was with thottbot/wowhead and it took me like 10 minutes (mostly travel time to the area).
---
&gt;  But they are a lot better than people give them credit.
---
Better than what credit? Different people have different opinions. If you expect to deal good dps or to be able to tank on par with a warrior you will be mistaken. I know that's not what the opinion seems to be on this sub but it's just the truth.
---
Meh, I'd give it to a Boomkin tbh. At least theres some comedy value in it.
---
Ps. No guild should ever hand you the mats for free... Some dude standing around in Org "advertising" for your guild is effectively worthless. Will be selling the ingots to the highest bidder to pay for consumes for the guild.
---
If you want to recruit people who think Molten Core is the hard shit, I guess that plan might work. But if you wana cut the wheat from the chaff. Run a guild organized pug raid weekly and effectively let you trial the players as much as they trial you. 
---
But sure, give it to the Shaman or Paladin otherwise. Takes up a bank spot.
---
Better yet, Sell it for even more money.
---
Certain class specs being for all intents and purposes not useable. I wish paladins would have been viable tanks for example.
---
Check my username out you will love it
---
&gt; just because they pulled aggro.
---
There is a difference between pulling aggro and pulling.  
---
Now, granted mistakes happen, but if you're going to keep making my job as a tank deliberately difficult, I'm either kicking you, or leaving.
---
Probably better than raw
---
I'm not doing a taste test though
---
They are both pretty damn easy to gear.
---
Pallys because you can wear cloth through plate and priests because their tier sets are actually really good for healing.
---
Won’t be able to use them until phase 3 but you’ll have the time and freedom to level them up and gear them out.
---
This is my plan too, although I really want a 49 too
---
There isnt much to gain from hitting Exalted with your own faction. The discount is achieved at Honored and the mounts are always available to your own faction. If you want to minmax reputation you would probably need to switch starting zones periodically to avoid doing gray quests while also making sure to do all the quests that gives you spill over reputation.
---
You won't be a GM, so it doesn't matter what you think.
---
right in the fucking Blue post. What's wrong with you?
---
I wanted to be hyped by this, but I can't. They created a disarray of unofficial &lt;LANG_NAME&gt; servers with limited official support in EU. You pay just to create a character on some random realm, by the release time you know it's now a Turkish realm and you can gtfo.
---
I will just think of an alternative character name while on it, and wait to see real situation what realm is what.
---
it's gonna be a thing.  the meta since private servers has been spam healing the tank while they max threat so bosses drop to fast dps.  but melee settings were wrong on privates, bosses actually get like 10% more parry chance and some other things so melee tanks get a huge nerf comparatively, while warlock tanks just ignore all of that and have the highest threat in the game
---
Ye I found out that weapon expertise is quite significant in Vanilla, which makes Human rogues a lot more lucrative than other races. Trying to find alternatives though!
---
I think the one everyone recommends is Joana's atm. I'd start there.
---
Reminds me of this bank robbery plan I heard about, where the robbers get jobs at the bank and they just **give** you the money... ingenious.
---
I do find it entertaining that the guy telling me I'm explaining common stuff is also yelling that others can't tell them what to do.  
---
Willingness to pay doesn't mean much. People are willing to pay for lootboxes, but that doesn't automatically mean that it's a good thing for the industry or that it isn't predatory. By your logic, you want lootboxes in the game since people are willing to pay for them and you can't tell them what to do. See the flaw? I'm sorry for using "make you", "compelling you" would have worked better, but we have to understand that for many with addictions they can almost be treated as equal. 
---
You are grasping for straws if you believe that I was whining that it isn't free. It was merely a question one can ask themselves when understanding why they decided to have it be a paid service two weeks before the launch of the game.
---
We clearly have different views. That's fine. Also, the issue with capitals isn't a misunderstanding of their use, it's how you used them to sound like a little child who just got told they couldn't have more ice-cream.
---
you know youtube didnt exist during most of vanilla wow?
---
I guess, just seems stupid for the sake of this post. If it's really to get a number count than I'd imagine the real number of subs will double come the following Friday. Makes more sense to have your employees work 1 weekend for the 14 million players?
---
Either get good or stfu. I don't have time to coach noobs
---
There were plenty of alt code names in classic, where do you get this information?
---
I expected a warlock to turn up and soulstone you.
---
"Your character's soul belongs to me now"
---
hahaha ohhh shit
---
Might be a bit more of a death run for you, but Westfall or even North East corner of Elwynn might be better so you're not dealing with NPC/town aggro and can stay out of the way of the majority of players. Redridge NPCs are much higher level than 15 that it could cause some problems.  
---
Either way, looking forward to it, might make the treck to UD country on my character.
---
My suggestion is come prepared with auto target + auto attack macros and camp spawn points if layering doesn't significantly help the experience.
---
How many realms will there be? 20? That means it takes only 5-6 spergs to reserve it on all realms. Why bother then?
---
deleted and remade my character because i got lost and didn't know hearthstones existed
---
I'm willing to use a mace early if need be, finding a good sword is going to be so hard on launch!
---
We're not fair here.
---
That was in TBC. You don't have the talents (nor the weapons) in Vanilla.
---
K buddy. Good luck with that.
---
I think so, dude.
---
I think that hes saying that everyone AND their brother in law will be playing Classic.
---
Hybrid tax
---
Theorycrafted. As viable as shaman or hunter tanks. You can do it IF the group pays attention or on specific fights
---
And this is when I quit sadly.
---
Ret is the leveling/PvP spec
---
Also they don't have any chairs.
---
Thex for me on 3 different realms!
---
7:31  for a juicy near one shot  
---
Heroic Strike Crit 1051  
---
Whirlwind Crit 695  
---
Autoattack Crit 993
---
Sword Spec Extra Attack Crit 883  
---
well hold on a second, heroic strike is the auto attack so why is there 2 white damage procs? double Sword Spec proc?  
---
a lucky second autoattack because of GCD efficiency?
---
Yeah 10k gold in mats that can exchanged on the auction house isn't worth much to a guild.
---
Bottle of vodka.
---
lol. You are so fucking dense, I swear to god.
---
Hybrids (and everyone else) lost a lot of their identity in wrath because all the buffs were interchangeable and nothing mattered. Every class was the same as the other classes that brought its buffs. 
---
Maybe you think that's worth the hybrids doing similar personal DPS was worth it, but I don't. I prefer to allow the personal gap to be a bit bigger, because their utlity brought more raid DPS back then (WF totem was *real*) and that is just a nice interaction I think people enjoy on a visceral level. You get *excited* to have that windfury totem, etc. It makes group setup a little more interesting than "ok we got all the buffs, nice." 
---
Final thought: please don't procreate
---
Ankh - FROSTSHOCK!!
---
The most shaman move ever... Thex for that!
---
Lmao, like this post is going to change anything. Grow up dude.
---
It was more for the 'scope' of supported weapon types (as we all know, Rogues got axes eventually in later expacs). That's why in-game thematic characters are special.
---
+ Swords
---
+ Claws (fist)
---
+ Daggers
---
+ Mace
---
Heavily depends on weapon coeffiecients
---
They lock character names in one faction only.
---
there won't
---
Honestly, I thought the same thing when I realized my classes start the same day, but the games demographic is going to be 90% 18+ year olds. Everyone has jobs or school or kids now. Many people are in the same boat, I wouldn’t worry too much.
---
Undead Warlock?
---
Fastest for hunter is to stay in darkshore until level 20ish grinding your face off but that is a special case. [https://discord.gg/kekm962](https://discord.gg/kekm962) On Bornlesszero's discord (a great NE speedrunner and great guy) there is a hunter channel with people who have great speedrun times. Check it out if you are looking for specifics for your case: [https://discord.gg/kekm962](https://discord.gg/kekm962)
---
It's not really to get a number count... It's to test the servers/layering tech.
---
Kinda agree with you that Warrior probably has the least flavour not the classes, but I still love playing them
---
everything cover but the sleeping before lounch, im not taking monday off of work so that might be an issue, i dont have alot of days to spare.
---
Imagine caring about this in 2019.
---
You won’t even have to wait. They’ll be in STV before most of us make it to Stormwind/Orgrimmar
---
If you want a warden staff for your druid plan on farming a couple hundred gold to buy it off the AH rather than expecting people to all pass a couple hundred gold to you just because of the class you rolled..
---
Classic will be different. There will be some of those same Dbags, but they will get a rep on the server and you will know to avoid them. You will make friends (prob other husband/wife groups, they were pretty common back then) that you group with more often than not. I had a steady 4 other people that I did 5 mans with and that was pretty much it. We would usually only have to pug 1 other person if someone couldn't play that night or w/e. We talked the entire time... mostly just about life and what not. I would highly recommend finding a good group of people that know it will be your wife's 1st (basically second, but classic 5 mans are a lot diff anyway so- 1st) and want to be a part of it. I used to love taking people that had no experience and showing them ins and outs of the dungeon... some of it self motivated, if I teach them really well I have someone else to run this with! Wow that got really long, sorry for the book.
---
Tell that to the guy that said it's easy to dedicate time to your character as long as you aren't a wage slave.
---
Taunts definently could still be resisted in vanilla, there was glyphs like one for DK taunt (Dark Command) to gain 8% hit on it, you are right however that they  gained range
---
If you go alliance youll have disadvantage as a lock against will of the forsaken
---
guilty
---
Some people like healing
---
I find everyone wants to play warrior, rogue, mage.. and a shaman named Thex.
---
I still have a wifi card in my PC so I'd just set my phone up as a hotspot for awhile, it's unlikely the internet would be out for more than a few hours.
---
It’s main purpose was actually to enhance player identity “I’m jisco, the frost mage. That’s storfan, the holy Paladin.” According to Kevin Jordan, anyways.
---
You can't go wrong with the core four... Warrior, Priest, Mage and Rogue.  Tank, heals, caster dps and melee dps!
---
Okay okay, the warriors are better than the rogues at dps, but their outfits are so  fugly.  Fashion = +250 dps!
---
I have to do this. I'm on my third account so I don't have any of my Vanilla achieves anymore so to avoid all the assholes that accuse me of lying about playing Vanilla to dismiss my opinions I use alts.
---
Oh 100% - agreed. They could have just as easily done the name reservation the weekend before and arguably still had the same benefits and only "wasted" 48 hours or so of sub time.
---
I guess I just consider "gimped" to be a harsher word. I wouldn't say "this guy has 1 piece of his gear I don't have. I'm gimped" to be accurate. I would say "this guy has the bwl xbow and I have an EPL quest bow. I'm gimped" is accurate, though.
---
Not only that, but unless phase 2 is significantly longer than it was on retail vanilla, nobody will even be rank 14 when bwl comes out. The first rank 14 on our server was rank 11 when bgs released. I would have mentioned that, but that other poster was just determined to be a doucher.
---
My bad guys, what I meant by this is: someone slaps the label toxic onto people who are assholes and all of a sudden people view said assholes as the worst people in the world. It’s a dramatic label that’s too often used, I was agreeing with OP
---
It’s gonna be mostly warriors rogues and mages
---
Why would those names be reserved?
---
It's not even saved between page transitions. It is very temporary. I didn't want to store that much information locally and I feel like it's pretty easy to pick up where you left off. If I get a lot of feedback that people want persistent checkboxes I'll look into it.
---
Well, I guess it's time to find a guild so I can make friends to coordinate with.
---

Feel free to provide any constructive counterarguments.
---
Yellow attacks (aside from like slam) don’t reset your swing timer, however “extra attacks” do reset the swing timer, and “extra attacks” can proc off yellow swings.
---
Ofc there’s other benefits to knowing your swing timer such as hamstring kiting, but I’m talking about dps not reducing damage taken.
---
I was on horde. I'm sure it would be a lot better on alliance.
---
I know about the PvP gloves but I didn't rank so I didn't have the gloves. 
---
Nightfall has a very high proc rate when you are channelling Drain Life + Corruption. Corruption ticks every 3 secs but Drain Life ticks every 1 second so the proc chance is very high.
---
Nightfall makes Shadowbolt instant cast, mate.
---
Shadowbolt does great threat, actually.
---
Even if you have pushback protection from Intensity you'll still be taking damage from Hellfire because Hellfire damages enemies as well as the warlock itself. On top of that you're tanking damage from the mobs. It's good for AoE dps but we are talking about tanking here.
---
There aren't "a ton" of Searing Pain talents. There's Improved Searing Pain which increases crit chance. 
---
Searing Pain is not a useless spell but it's not good for tanking because of pushback. It's probably more useful on Alliance because of Concentration Aura but threat is not an issue.
---
You're right, he is a winner at streaming, I can't deny that and would never want to even attempt to mislead others to believing otherwise. 
---
That said, he's a loser at *life*. Aside from not being obese, he exhibits the rest of the neckbeard stereotype of a loner with none/few successful personal relationships and growing as an adult. He lives at home and is addicted to gaming.  That trope is the one that successful professionals who do have lives outside of games, struggle to fight against. 
---
Plus he's a huge asshole to people, from what I've seen. The way he talks to people is really awful, so even if he was not a total loser outside of gaming/streaming, then he's still pretty unlikable for that, alone.
---
Serious question. He's really someone you look up to? Someone you would strive to *be like*?
---
Not that I mind that people like him. I don't. I dont care what other people like. I dont care if a billion people watch his stream. But I would care, if I was on his server, and I'm out in the wild having to deal with the dozens of people following/parading him around.
---
There are lots of names that are already blacklisted. Basically anything significant to lore.
---
When I played vanilla I was 11 or 12 years old and my uncle was sharing his account with me so I could only play certain times of day. He played religiously so I was in a constant state of withdrawal waiting for the next hit.
---
What?
---
Yeah most likely raid tiers will come out when retail is in a drought vice versa
---
your life must blow man
---
Those players 
---
A: won't even touch classic
---
B: will see themselves kicked out of groups that took 30 minutes to assemble once or twice until they learn their lesson
---
I am already looking forward to this kind of behavior - as I am going for heals... will be fun to let little pissants like that die and run back from GY :D
---
Redridge is neutral so the alliance will get flagged for PvP also. That’s the reason I’ll be heading to Redridge.
---
There’s plenty of areas that don’t have guards so that shouldn’t be a problem.
---
Not to mention that is the exact same system used by the last stress test, even down to the create three characters per account.
---
a skilled prot warrior can sell tanking service for 5mans. That is what I plan to do.
---
I actually agree, I just worded what I said like a Neanderthal. That’s the point I was trying to make
---
I'd like to see a full guild of druids doing raid content.  Might need a token class to dispel magic though.  But I think someone mentioned earlier there are consumables that will remove a magic debuff.
---
"HERE COMES THE PAIN BITCH"

"YohnStamos has been slain by gloom"
---
:( good memories, but you're right. teleport/static bot was still useful in groups.
---
FUCK YOU. Go play Bfa you butthole. Fartfaces like you aren’t welcome in classic. 
---
Selfish ass
---
All these *spins board* **millennial** ... lmao made me chuckle.
---
1 am mate.  3pm PDT is 0000 GMT.  That changes when we switch back to standard time to be 2pm PST is 0000 GMT.
---
This is not true AT ALL. Yes, you will occasionally face someone using Free Action Potions, but certainly not every fight. Not to mention that with 2 ice blocks in a mage arsenal, you're going to have your opponent use 2-3 potions each fight?
---
Come on dude. The vast majority of players are going to never use a Free Action Potion and even those who do aren't going to have them for every fight. You're being totally unreasonable.
---
You know you are right and as a long time member of the alliance I encourage you all to leave these issues all to the alliance. No need to address any of them we will take all the issues and the good loot from here. Have a nice and relaxing day.
---
There’s options aside from Thex? Lies
---
&gt; If you see a retail player, don't be toxic to him/her, add him to you ignore list instead.
---
cringe edgelord The_Donald poster
---
Hell no! 😂
---
I didn't understand threat. Went into Wailing Caverns on my first character an Undead Warlock and spammed the everliving fuck out of Searing Pain. The rest of the group set me straight after the first couple of bosses.
---
In the very same run I got red gear (wonder why...) and not wanting to embarrass myself further in the eyes of the group I whispered my more experienced friend in a panic because I thought the gear was broken for good and I needed to get new pieces.
---
Hi! Welcome to the internet. You must be knew here.
---
I wouldn’t hold my breath. Just have 1 million would be amazing
---
As I said before. If every class can do every role equally good no matter what, that waters down the game.
---
3pm on the west coast, and I'll be driving home from a customer meeting, looks like I'll be bringing a laptop with me.
---
If you are discussing the Wintersaber quests, those are repeatable, not daily. There is no gating if you have the time to grind.
---
Well the time was given in Pacific Standard Time and you're in Central Standard Time, which is 2 hrs later. The Texas school system has failed you.
---
Danger. Most places will have the wow client totally blocked in their firewall. 
---
Must skip.
---
Thats a sound plan!
---
how much grinding
---
Are there any viable rogue builds that don't spec into dual wield specialization?
---
True, but I guess you're more likely to see level 15 players roaming in westfall to pick a fight with.  Nobody will be naturally progressing to redridge in the stress test, so finding people would be a challenge.
---
The people that are saying all roll on boes when another class can use something and it’s bis for them pre raid are the same people trying to reserve flask of the titans and the gear they want when they make pugs. Believe that lol
---
will bgs be cross realm when they are released or will they be made cross realm later down the line
---
Eyy baby wanna have THEX?
---
It makes you wander so you could be sap-able
---
I was an optimistic lad and expected scaling to apply to everything, becaue why else would they design it?
---
...still have no idea.
---
These are the things making me consider these two.  I like the other classes, but being a rogue in the early 40s with thrash blade and the sm quest sword felt so good crushing those tanaris pirates
---
I thought it's Skarm the Tank. Kappa
---
I do!
---
It takes stones to be a Warlock.  Ask yourself if you've got the stones for it.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Totally! And it was important they did it so the warlock could get off a shadowbolt.
---
Gonna play horde
---
AMEN BROTHER
---
LET US MEET THEM IN GLORIOUS BATTLE
---
I am just using their hosting. But since you asked about the content that's all the reason I need to nerd out. The site was originally a wiki which ran into many limitations that I had to outgrow but transitioning to a site was going to be a big task. I liked the ease of editing using wikitext but also liked the control of the full web languages. So I wrote a custom generator that inhales a subset of wikitext and produces the website. So I get the ease of editing in wikitext and the control of the full web languages and have the amazing wiki templating system to boot that makes keeping the pages consistent extremely easy. It will also hopefully make generating another output like that needed for guidelime that many are asking for as well. Has paid many many dividends.
---
I love that line, makes it infinitely more epic!
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005--053500030003
---
That is pretty much the basis of every frost raiding build. For optimal deep frost build you want to go down to Arcane Meditation in the Arcane Tree and the rest go into frost (usually to get Winter's Chill). Winter's Chill is the "raid buff" talent and at least 1 mage should have it, but it's easily something we can cut for a more pvp friendly build.
---
Everything else is optional. Arcane Focus isn't really needed either and could be moved to Imp Arcane Missiles if that's a thing. Even Frost Channeling isn't that important and probably means even less with more optimized raid groups and quicker kill times than we originally saw. I raided with Ice Block, Cold Snap, and Ice Barrier my entire time in Vanilla.
---
Hats okay. I'm 0/9 M on Mal Ganis.
---
Trolls and Dwarves are definitely the best races for their respective factions
---
You could just implement an “are you sure” button that wouldn’t require a change to a game system.
---
From what we know, when they are released.
---
Just wait until the client actually opens for name reservation and every other post here is "Look at the name I got saved for my Shaman!!!"
---
Hehe, just wait until you group with a hunter that can't control his pet :D 
---
Wipes will be commonplace in vanilla - people will think twice to leave a group that took 30 minutes to assemble &amp; 20 minutes travel time.
---
As a priest, the idea of a tank who is actively conscious about mana sounds great.
---
That is correct
---
Depends on whether or not the item is a quest item or not.  Some quests just use generic materials like [Goretusk Liver Pie](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=22/goretusk-liver-pie), and some cause mobs to drop quest-specific loot.  These items get deleted from your inventory (a warning pops up before this happens).
---
I didn’t know what the spell book was and I accidentally dropped my starting spells off my action bar in the first few levels, so  until lvl 12 I almost only used melee attacks.
---
Mine isn't. I can't handle that much soda and sleep deprivation these days.
---
That means a lot, thank you. I've done UI work for some medical software companies in the past.
---
auras because raid wide in WOTLK
---
great, thanks
---
Even Classic is a repost.
---
Thanks for the tip. I’ll try my luck in Redridge first and take it from there.
---
Evasion implies illegal activity.  What they did wasn't illegal.  It kinda sucks conceptually, but that's how accounting works.
---
Can I use this?
---
I really can't be bothered with only 48 hours of beta, especially when most of that time I'll be sleeping or working. I also don't care enough about reserving names when that causes me to waste half of a subscription because Blizzard is greedy and trying to milk every penny out of players.
---
Adding on to yours - there was no "Return to Graveyard" button, so if your ghost got stuck somewhere it couldn't get to your corpse, you're waiting for a GM ticket to respawn.
---
Only on PvP servers
---
Walking/riding to dungeons. Group finder is amazing.
---
Awesome, thanks critical.
---
Idk I suppose if you really didn't want to do it at 20 but u unlock ghost wolf at 20 so it's not as bad as it seems lmao
---
I’ll be there!
---
Farm devilsuars and hoard the leathers until everyone hits 60 and they need it for their pre raid BIS list, then make an easy 5k gold for consumes and mount.
---
Idk if blizzard can fix people lol
---
You're right I thought that was changed one patch prior to 3.0.1 (so it was technically TBC but kinda not really in the grand scheme of things)
---
There is already at least 1 addon that basically does this.
---
I mean, if you can actually play that much per week, then yes, you could play two characters. Hell, you'll probably need to in order to not be bored haha.
---
:( I might have to give my account info to my buddy because there's a high chance I won't be available at 3pst. EST sure, but not 6. At least the name I intend to use on my rogue is very rarely taken in games, even ones that have been running for a while but I have a mage name in mind from pop culture that could definitely get snatched up
---
That moment when you run across fellow TDS fan in a WoW reddit....
---
What the fuck are you talking about lmao.
---
aint no honor in world pvp baby!
---
Yeah mostly, but it seems kinda hypocritical to me for Humans to deflect blame because of being manipulated by Onyxia, but judge the orcs for getting manipulated by the Burning Legion.
---
That makes sense. Were you posing it as a bad thing, or just an observation. If the former I disagree, I think it's very smart business to maintain a revenue stream.
---
When I recently played on p****s*****, dungeons were no issue what so ever. People communicated and in general followed instructions very well. Ofc there is the one odd noob that you encounter, but I ask myself, is he an ass BC he doesn't know better or am I the ass not teaching him how it's done.
---
I think once you get into the higher LVL dungeons most of the crappy players will have given up already.
---
And if push comes to shove, I'll just roll a mage, solo aoe grind to 60 and call it a day.
---
Toxic: a property or substance which is inimical to the necessary biological functions to sustain life; poisonous.
---
He’s typing gibberish. There is no warlock tank.
---
A website _is_ an API. I guarantee that it would take about fourteen seconds before someone made a bot to scrape the pages and compile them into their own scoring site.
---
Thanks! And i guess it has haha
---
Just make multiple chars lvl 20. It takes a day to do and u will gain rested bonus.
---
Maybe I'm remembering it incorrectly, but I remember in Vanilla the name release was not instantaneous. It was something like 30 days before the name was released from the account.  (can anyone correct or confirm? lol)
---
Intrstresting I always here eveyone talking about grinding, grinding. I guess it's not a much time as it's made out to be? I play about 5hrs everyday.
---
put on spell dmg gear, pull big groups of satyrs/poison eles in felwood, barkskin -&gt; hurricane -&gt; ??? -&gt; repeat
---
Things like only doing shortcuts in instances to not being right to roll need on quest items. Specifically the gems from lbrs that you need to create ubrs key.
---
You’re assuming that there’s gonna be constant farms setup and innumerable guilds actually clearing enough of MC to flood the market.
---
*pssst* there’s not
---
watch out you said a naughty word, ban pre-empting.
---
illidann here i come
---
nobody else will think of this
---
Mike Tyson, Noooooooo!

That's how timezones work. It releases 0:00 CEST on the 27th, which means it's still the 26th for our American friends.
---
sry can't hear u through my priest's divine shield, something a tank wouldn't know about because they need rage
---
Read the wall, love it. I think we're what you're looking for. Feel free to check out my post history to see a basic/vague description of our guild. I think you'll fit right in. 
---
We're a guild of mostly close IRL friends and close e-friends that we've made over time. Some of us have been playing wow since vanilla and many of us that don't play wow anymore, continue to play with one another in various games (at a high level). We're mostly all working individuals/military, aged 20s-30s. Our focus will be raid progression, pvp in all aspects, community events, guild camaraderie, and fun time bullshit shenanigans as a group. 
---
Again, let me know if there's anything else you wanna know. We're a great group of people, and looking to meet more and grow as classic progresses.
---
That’s some serious statistical analysis right there.
---
Look fuck all y’all - for the scourge!
---
It this subreddit over the last month is any indication it's going to be all thex.
---
So, fun fact: for Rogues, Human Rogues aren't as OP as you'd think. Yes, the Sword racial is quite strong, but by BWL it's actually completely negated due to gear/weapons providing +Sword Expertise.
---
Reason being, Rogues get +5 swords from their Talents, an insanely strong talent. This puts the Rogue at 305 Sword Expertise. Human Rogues get an extra 5, meaning you'll have 310. The kicker? At 308 expertise, the benefit from Expertise drops off dramatically to the point that it is almost a worthless stat. So, before BWL, a Human Rogue only really gets the benefit of +3 and once you obtain Maladath, you get +4 Sword.
---
TLDR? Humans are a great pick but for Rogues, due to the Sword Talent, the gap is much smaller than people think. Human is still the best PvE choice for the Alliance though since no other race provides a direct DPS Boost due to their racials, unlike the Horde side (Orc and Troll).
---
*rolls PVE and /wave everyone*
---
&gt; Other people are completely incapable of judging which things are actually good or bad for the game and just have staunch arbitrary beliefs of "If it was in during 2004-2006 then it's good, if 2007+ then it's bad."
---
No, people have genuine opinions for real reasons. You may not agree with their conclusions, but categorically dismissing their reasoning like that is not helpful.
---
Personally, I was opposed to the Armory when they first proposed adding it, and I'm thrilled by the idea that it won't be back. The only behaviors it enables are pathological ones.
---
Oh please, the Trolls have been idolizing Hakkar for generations and you guys were like "it's all gravy baby"
---
That refeers to letting someone else use your game, this happened during hearthstone beta, someone wa like "im done but i can share it with people using this" and they got called out by blue posts
---
Yeah that seems to be the feeling I'm getting. Too bad lol
---
You actually think you’re going to tank anything beyond hogger?
---
Hunter gear!
---
lol that's your reaction to that story where they died once?
---
If you're their target I think you can jump back on the platform and kill the mobs after you drop VC. Still a waste of time imo though.
---
What bgs can you use flying mounts in??
---
you can't out-threat me so u don't have a choice in the matter
---
You can spec 30/21/0 if you want (or even 20/31/0) and be able to raid-heal while also tanking in 5mans or 10mans.  You can also PVP in these variants but generally for PVP I would want at least 21 holy for Divine Favor and full 5/5 reckoning which in pure PVE tank builds you may not take. 
---
You can also spec 21/0/30 and be a viable DPS when you outgear stuff (like DPSing MC in your t2 set)!  This is a pretty good PVP spec too for doing burst damage.  Once you get really good gear this spec actually becomes a pretty solidly OK DPS choice but you need truly great crit% to keep vengeance up all the time.   YOu also go OOM pretty easily. 
---
Honestly, paladins are not great PVE tank or DPS BUUUUT you can 100% be a great raid healer and also be really solid at different aspects of PVP.  You can be a ret boss in PVP while also being a dress-wielding flash of light maniac with 21/0/30.   Not many classes can effectively PVE and PVP in the same spec.
---
most will sunscribe the day of release to maximize the game time paid for.
---
Yea but we've got *Thex* now
---
I like innovation, but you don’t need this for totems.
---
https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2500693-Classic-will-have-10-Million-Players from a thrrad earlier today
---
Ayy, Ann Arbor represent!
---
I disliked the community it brought with them. While it obviously doesn't apply to everyone, stereotypes exist for a reason. Many UD players were edgy as shit, and many Belfs were children or weeaboos.
---
The quality of players on my server at the time on Horde felt like it went drastically down with the addition of Belfs.
---
Also I just have a personal beef with the change in style for Belfs. Originally they seemed to be designed to be very proud (see how they held their noses up at all times) and xenophobic, thinking themselves superior to all others. While there's still remnants of that, the new design made them more into a running gag of "Haha elves are so flamboyant! Don't touch my hair xD"
---
me and my friends at uni had a slightly odd introduction.  we played dota 1 against bots for a while, becoming absolutely addicted to it, before hearing that there was this new game that was basically the same but looked more modern - it was ofc LoL so we played that for a while
---
we ended up watching some of Ti1 while testing our setup for watching some LoL tournament that was on around the same time.  We, being noobs, thought dota looked boring because not much ability spam was happening... oh how wrong we were.  Once me and 1 friend got invites to the dota 2 beta we never looked back
---
Go dagger spec. Done.
---
There's plenty of people who aren't going to no life this game, to the point that any upgrade to what they currently have, is a needful situation.
---
people who play retail wow
---
&gt; Cool I hope you roll a hybrid and are forced to heal.
---
Why do you think we're talking about WoW Classic? I was talking about TBC, something I've already reminded you of. In TBC I think the personal DPS numbers were close enough; in Classic I don't.
---
idk why I bother trying to make the conversation easy for you to follow. You will just decide that I said something completely other than what I said and argue against that instead.
---
Cenarius attacked the orcs first. They were forced to drink demon blood in order to defend themselves.
---
 The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
---
Flying ruined everything.
---
You could clipboard alt-code in for some reason during vanilla but I think it was unintended.
---
I know at some point names get temp locked to your account after deletion in retail, just not sure what the triggers are.
---
To add to the discussion, a large portion of a Priests Pre-Bis is directly from BRD (like 8-11 pieces) in the current patch. While I don't know anything about Paladins or their Pre-Bis, getting a Priest into a decent gear situation shouldn't be too bad as a result. Nothing like leveling while also grabbing the gear you were going to farm at 60.
---
The Horde symbol is not symmetric like that.
---
Gj on the the class vectors.
---
Set server names already so we can know where Friends are going and all that. Especially if we have to choose on the 12th a little heads up would be nice.
---
Sure, that's why I shared it. Enjoy!
---
At the same time though... Only 3 more weeks.
---
I remember back in classic WoW and on FFXI I had a shitlist of players who I had met and who, whie they weren't bad enough to land on a blacklist, they were bad enough to never group with.
---
That's the future of people who are douches to each other. And in a game with no random matchmaking, where you need others to do content, you don't want to be landing on people's lists.
---
Haha, glad to help. It's been a while since I've been in web development, so it was nice to get to make some contributions. I noticed some remnants of the voice control code, but didn't quite look into it. Assumed it was a first start at an accessibility feature, which would honestly be pretty dope.
---
It really all depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Assuming you hit 60 fairly quickly and get geared out in Pre-BiS, all you can do is raid and hope for gear drops. A good group will be able to clear MC in only a few hours early on (and even faster later in the game) meaning all that's left is PvPing and grinding gold/consumables.
---
It is a lot of grinding, but it all depends on what you're grinding for. Your epic mount? Maxed out consumables? PvP Ranks? There's only so much you can really do in a week.
---
Timezones are a thing
---
whaaaaa, no way! I loved shatt
---
It will be the 27th in some parts of the world. For those in the states, it will be the 26th. 
---
Timezones can be confusing.
---
I had this mod for grins, and had some fun annoying people with the spam! Fun little story about it: One time my guild was in AQ40 in the gauntlet on the way to Fankriss. I popped combustion, and managed to get a 10 stack of it somehow (ie next fire spell is a guaranteed crit). So...when we stacked everything up to murderlize them, I went into the middle of the crowd and popped blastwave. Needless to say, I spammed the hell out of the raid, and was disconnected as well :D
---
USB tether your smart phone like you do during power outages. works fine as long as you don't need to use voice like skype or disc on the same device.
---
Nihilism will get you far
---
He's not wrong. Just replace it in BRD, it's not like that has a high barrier to enter
---
Shadowstep.
---
it made the game feel less grounded
---
I get why some people get the appeal, I just don’t see burning ~$7.50 so I can login and create 3 characters. Nobody cares about that when the first started playing wow, it’s no different now. 
---
Also I don’t want to buy more game time after playing for 2 weeks. That would make it $30 for the first month of playing which is a bad deal as well.
---
# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; 18+ Competent Raiding | NA Horde
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun. Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers(**Hunter, Rogue**), Raiders(**application only**), and general members of all skill levels.
---
The server type has been decided by vote:  
---
**The server type is PvP.**
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, or to extend the raid time to midnight, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two 4 hour raids is quite doable.  
---
Tuesday 7-11PM  
---
Thursday 7-11PM
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most drama causing decisions from being made.
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all star to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40 people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of a guild of decent individuals to run dungeons with or just hang out, you can simply join the guild. **You only need to post an application** **if** **you want to raid.**
---
Please, do not apply if:  
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.  
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.  
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:  
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.  
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.  
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, post here, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Shizune the guild leader.

So by hell do you mean your bringing the burning legion? with you cus that was last expansion... and that's not classic!!!

it says eu so it doesn't matter.

You screw up TWO TIMES and they never let it go. We've changed for good now.

*looks at Sylvannas*
---
TBC I would frost trap FWGY and stop the mounted kiter of the commander and gaurds there. I could solo turtle for the horde long enough for us to win. Being BM I was unstoppable for 1-2 minutes with the commander and guards which was all our side needed. Also I would trap their tank when on Galv which made Galv kill their dps and healers.
---
Good old community focused warcraft :) I can remember my favorite video about fire mage pvp  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w) but there was a plenty even home singed at that time also that one with "Too sexy" song, remember how I watched that with friend who bring me in the world of warcraft :D I hope there will be new coming with classic wow! ;)
---
Norwegian?
---
Melee in AV is miserable
---
assuming the 3 characters are on the same server, Blizz would just count that as 1 when calculating the alliance/horde ratio. But since the 3 characters don't have to be on the same server (i.e. 3 characters on 3 different realms), then yeah, the stats won't be accurate.
---
Divine storm for Ret paladins
---
The Druid would be better off selling it so they can respec resto and get into raids
---
It makes you immune so no
---
If the answer is no, just grind out some before raid time.
---
I see no reason why it wouldn't work on Blind, but Stoneform is blanket immunity, like how slows won't work on someone with Blessing of Freedom.
---
I’m taking boe epics which are bis for a class until raiding and beyond. No reason a class shouldn’t get priority for that (as long as they equip it) it’s no different than boss loot imo. It’s comical people try to defend greed by saying “they don’t have a right to it” even though it’s no different than any gear their class uses
---
That's kinda what I said though.
---
There are numerous factors that go into determining whether it is worth using. As an example, if my main has the only Lionheart helm pattern on the server and I make thousands of gold a day in crafting fees then I might value leveling with SoJ over selling it. Maybe I think it looks cool and value the appearance over the gold. Maybe it saves me seconds, minutes, hours, days off my leveling because it's the best thing I find for 20+ levels and I value that time saved over gold later. Value is relative to the player and their situation and goals.
---
Come on guys were gona have to work extra hard to get Thex!
---
Little fuckers are having the time of their lives.
---
Why is it bad that you want to play a class that you think everyone else wants to play?
---
I was little bit mistaken, it's addon "cdframes". And it includes 2 panel with your cds and enemy's cd
---
Yeah what an idiot lol, he's gonna ruin his experience by playing the way he wants to, not the way you want him to.
---
What a loser.
---
Paladins are harder to gear up in raids since the tier1 and tier2 sets are terrible for healing.
---
T2 helm is not a random world drop, nor is it a BOE, nor is it pre-raid.
---
I want to agree with you but this example is almost as irrelevant as they come.
---
Taunt as a Druid or Paladin.
---
If they went through and polished the graphics to retail level it might hit on the teens but I imagine the demographic for vanilla is 20-40. I have nothing to substantiate that, just my thoughts on who it will appeal too.
---
Was going back and forth between mage and hunter every ten minutes for weeks, until I realized I can be both and decided on a warlock. Right now I'm just doing my best trying not to think about it..
---
right. cuz you just wait until frostbolt cast is finished and has hit the target until you hit the key again
---
Better than 3 pm PST. Guess I'll leave early that day.
---
It launches 27th 00:00 London time. Obivously it will go live across the US during the afternoon sometime depending where you are at.

---
No. Stone form doesn't attempt to remove poison, like abolish poison does. It makes you completely immune to them, like how Divine Protection makes you immune to everything. It can't fail.
---
Fair Haven checking in.. looking for a server/guild..
---
Na but it should work on abolish poisons. Vile Poisons is not worth it over Imp poisons though.
---
Good info, thank you!
---
Oh nice now we have the guy who tells people what they can play to compete 15 year old content
---
Meh, I main'd priest and I would much rather have my tank be quick on the pulls. Mana breaks suck.
---
world pvp?

Heroic Leap 100%, especially with the Prot PVP talents!

If your idea of class balance is being good at running flags in wsg, then there is little more to say from either of us.
---
Trick question: All wars are crimes.
---
Man i dont even blame them. The lfg system in retail is retarded. There is no option for who how you want to play. Its from rookies to nfl veteran's were all placed in the same pool and expect to get along. If i was an nfl player i wouldnt want to waste an hour holding peoples hands who dont know whats going on. And if i was a rook i wouldnt wanna be pounded into the ground continuously. Im suprised they never had a player rank system if they used a match making system. Its actually so terrible its hillarious. I dont blame these "toxic" players nor these "n00bs". Im excited to have no match making system so your nor forced to play with players you don't want to.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info. Do you know if cdframes will work in Classic? or is this screenshot from retail/private server?
---
The argument is that there is a set number of raid resets before Naxx release. If you clear all raids when they're off ID, you should have enough gear to equip 8 tanks.
---
Priests don't have Divine shield.
---
Ah yes, them good old generalisations.
---
Honestly? Odds are most of us on the Horde don't even bother with AV. AV is Alliance favored to an insane degree. I don't want them to try to change it or balance it as I want classic to stay as pure as reasonably possible, but Alteric Valley still sucks dick for the Horde. The most experienced PvPers will know Alteric Valley sucks and wont even bother. 
---
And frankly, that's all it will take. If most the good Horde players wont even bother trying, or simply have less interest in trying multiple times, then it will snowball. More and more Horde players will get stomped on in AV and just never try again. And then boom, you have your Meta.
---
Lol I’ve been thinking the same thing, but it appears your answer is “yes”
---
And for you, Frodo Baggins, I give you a vial of my finest bathwater
---
The luck of being in EU not having so many streamers to worry about!
---
I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast.
---
IMO it's not so bad when leveling because you can pretty much always level one character on rested and your higher-level character can send items to your other character. The issue is once you reach 60. There is no way unless you have no life to raid on two characters simultaneously. I did have two 60s back in Vanilla, I did a lot of dungeoning on my main to gear up for MC, and barely played my alt all through MC and BWL, but our guild hit a progression snag and we started re-running MC as well as doing frequent ZG runs. My main with tier 2 took a back seat and I kind of tagged along with newer guildies through ZG and MC a couple of times to gear up my alt. My alt didn't really see any major action at 60 until the tail end of Vanilla's run and that was just due to circumstance.
---
I work 24hr shifts and am hoping to find a guild willing to work with me. Although I am not holding my breath.
---
Deep Freeze. It was so good they removed it from retail.
---
blizz should have a way of auto-generating doctor's notes on character creation day and launch day for paying customers.
---
Oh, well shit. I was going to be toxic, but then I read OP's post and now I'm not.
---
Kidding of course, but I find this a little pointless. Anyone who is going to be an ass is just going to be.
---
Druid population will not be low. That's a myth. Just count the number of posts here that are about druids and compare with other classes. Each and every player thinks "druid dps is viable now that shedo has made a guide" or "im gonna be druid tank like skarm".
---
Some alien invaders invade the orcish home world, rename the planet after themselves knowing full well another alien race is chasing them.
---
Kiljaden hmm i wonder where these dranei went?
---
Mannoroth, probably this planet draenor it used too be classified as 12c the local inhabitants are so far immune to the fel as they are shamanistic in nature and weild no magics.
---
Fanboys aka wastes of space
---
I'd rather see Classic+ than TBC tbh.
---
NA is notoriously bad at videogames though.
---
Glad we agree that hybrids weren't strong enough in tbc.
---
Well there it is... the dumbest thing I've read all day.
---
prayer of mending
---
They most likely already have characters made on their server of choice. At one point soda mentioned that streamers we able to save their names before everyone else.
---
I mean I'm probably gonna recreate 4 of my top toons over the years, and perhaps branch out to 1 or 2 more classes that I've considered. What is a main anyway.
---
It's not even close? They're not even in the top four. Hunter, mage, warlock and druid are definitely faster. Rogue and warrior are faster too in my opinion (although I've never leveled a rogue to 60). I've never played shaman or paladin, so I can't say anything about those.
---
The grind to 60 in Vanilla is fun because the world is alive and relevant.  You could play it single player if you chose and the game would still be on par with any other open world adventure game.  
---
The vanilla grind in BC and beyond is a desiccated mess, a chore of dragging yourself through content that has been intentionally obsoleted, whose only purpose was to keep everyone from slamming the first zone or two of the expansion at once.  All that lead up to the scholomance and stratholme and Blackrock mountain mean nothing in BC because you immediately head to Outland at 58 for your free naxx ilvl gear.  In WotLK, Outland is just where you grind to 68 before heading to Northrend, completely ignoring the build up to the conflict with Illidan and Kael’thas.  Even in Cataclysm, they didn’t adjust the old world to take you 1-80 before letting you exploring the now unlocked zones.  You were still expected to drag yourself through Outland and now Northrend even though everyone has been talking about how those events have been resolved.  
---
That method of killing every expansion that came before just compounded until they slapped the adjustable level bandaid on to those zones, but it was too little, too late.  What SHOULD have been a standard “you can start at the latest expansion’s minimum level” ended up being a “you pay for a level boost every time you try a new character”.   Even offering free expansions just gives a player with a subscription the chance to go gawk at the expansion they missed, marvel that no one is there, and cancel their sub.  
---
Even in BFA, I can’t start the expansion at the beginning of this arc.  All the stuff that led up to teldrassil burning and the plaguing of undercity was the expansion launch event and is no longer available. (I think)  They put all this effort in to having a continuity based story, and you can’t even go see all the stuff that came before because all the plot conclusions are tied up in raids.
---
The reason why it’s a fair critique is because one one exists in a bubble. If this “cash grab” goes well for Blizzard and people pay for the opportunity to reserve 3 names, it encourages Blizzard to do more things like this in the future. It encourages Blizzard to find more opportunities to separate you from your money. 
---
So while you may find that the cost of the price of an “early” subscription is worth the value gained, other people won’t. And chances are they won’t find value in the future opportunities Blizzard has for things like this. So they will lose out in potential access to the name they want now, and whatever else Blizzard comes up with down the line. 
---
I don’t want to say something like, if you start your subscription early with the intention of getting access to the stress test and reserving names, it will cause Blizzard to change their subscription model to be $15 a month for retail and $15 a month for classic, that would be a silly slippery slope to start. But if they get away with an extra $8 now, what’s to stop them from setting the reservation time a month early for $15 next time?
---
Stop taking this forums crappy stereotypes to heart.
---
A warrior in good gear can solo pvp most classes fine.
---
A warrior can grind and earn money just fine.
---
That being said play what you like.
---
This is your answer OP. I'll just chime in and say rolling prot or ret is totally fine. In Zul Gurub we had a ret paladin who had more dispels than anyone else and did more damage than the warlocks - which says more about the warlocks but still. 
---
The simple fact is that Paladins have far above average support capacities. Most raids want 3 or 4 per run. Even if one is ret or prot. Further, palafins are IN DEMAND because they have a low class population.
---
How can anyone play ascension WoW is beyond me.
---
.....except....Azeroth doesn’t belong to orcs. For the horde to complain about all the problems the alliance has caused on Azeroth is like the Burning Legion complaining about the problems the orcs caused on Draenor. Barging into someone else’s home and then raging to them because their house is a mess seems...obtuse. Maybe go back to Outland and fix the problems you guys left there in order to commit genocide here...
---
It's also good to have a much higher level character that can supply your alt with gold and stuff you can make leveling rather painless for your alt. I remember at a certain point after doing dungeons and then raiding enough I didn't have much to do on my main so I leveled my alt.
---
Yeah but it's going to be cross server BGs so queue times don't depend on your servers imbalance.
---
Old nerds. This is totally my wheelhouse. Looking forward to more.
---
Only if you are perceptive to sarcasm.
---
Wanding is good up to a certain level. It's not fun but it's definitely effective, especially because early on wands are very strong compared to your spells.
---
&gt; Realm Names later this Week!!!
---
Finally! This is literally the last bit of information I care about before launch, good luck avoiding the streamers and also would there be a way to create individual realm subs for recruiting or just gabbing with our new potential friends?
---
Because bliz is allowing the big streamers to reserve their names before asshats are able to take them. Classic wouldn't be a thing if it wasn't for the streamers that pushed for it and played the beta to advertise it.
---
Just 1 if you're very, very lucky - All 3 gems are not 100% drop, and even if all 3 drop on your first run you still have to win the roll for each of them. So it can be 1, 5, 10 or even more.
---
*Larplarpson gains Shadowform*  *You have been kicked the party*

Healers heal, and top healing on the meters is from the best healers.
---
The ssd did that much of a difference?  I’m at a point now where I am almost in need to upgrade after squeezing almost every bit of power without upgrading my stock hp laptop. The problem is a 256gb ssd costs more than I paid for my laptop...
---
Well, I don't want to raid at all. Maybe just a ZG pug every now and then. Mostly planning to do PvP/dungeons.
---
Mobile hotspot. Works fine.
---
Hex
---
Travel time or hybrid class design.
---
I don't know if I am misremembering, but I thought at one point in wow history, maybe TBC, they had 1 hour of free respecs if you accidentally put a talent point in the wrong place.
---
Umm... no
---
Thank you, I felt weird typing that out but I couldn’t place it.
---
Some people also want to reserve alt names too.
---
He is most likely one of the ones that leave so no issue.
---
Fair, I was deliberately trying to be absurd, because I think this whole thing is silly.
---
Except it was a regressive tax on healers and tanks -- the classes you actually needed more people to play. There are better ways to remove excess money from game economies.
---
I've been waiting til closer to launch to find a guild to start with and I'll definitely be rolling on a PST PVP server. If you have the time, dm me. Im my duoing with my best friend, him a priest and myself a hunter.
---
I agree with you. But if your wife never wants to do a dungeon again after that shes overreacting as badly as they did.
---
The pyroclasm talent is really really bad. It's 26% chance over the course of a full hellfire, which means that each tick has a normalized percentage. I think hellfire is like 10 ticks, so that's 2.6% chance to stun. And since you'll rarely rarely get a full hellfire off the effective rate is even sadder.
---
a shapeshifting reptilian?
---
It will be when someone impersonates them with their normal name and does some shady shit. Can already foresee the "soda stole my X" or "Towellee stood in stormwind begging for gold" posts that would come from that. It's best just to let them have their names and stop the fanboys from causing issues.
---
Problem is it primarily affected healers and tanks -- the two classes you needed more people to play.
---
You eat pieces shit for breakfast?
---
Because they are getting special treatment.
---
And you can be damn sure they don't limit them to take 1 name, they will be prioritized and get to take 3 names, so it's not only "their" name. Oh, and imagine if streamers such as Ninja would get prioritized, don't you think there are a bunch of others who also have used "Ninja" as a name? Don't you think more people have used "Chance" as a name? You can be damn sure Sodapoppin will reserve both "Sodapoppin" and "Chance"..
---
Funny how I get downvoted, you want people to get special treatment in Classic?
---
"Streamers name" Its not THEIR name until they get it in game.
---
Streamers will probably get in an hour early, even if they dont theyll be first on line since thats what they do for a living.
---
I doubt that
---
i think it will be a lot better. when i was learning how to heal on private servers and doing an absolutely terrible job, nobody ever got angry with me and they certainly never rage quit. you pulled bc you don't know what healing aggro is? np. we wiped? np, let's do better next time. this is your first time doing deadmines and you accidentally pulled a boss? lol we're gonna laugh about this the entire run back.
---
i remembered people and the things they did, if someone was a douchebag i just wouldn't group with them again, it's a common sentiment. i think it will be a much friendlier environment than retail
---
Which is one of the things holding me back investing a lot of time classic. I enjoy BFA actually, and my memories as pally in vanilla were fun but healing isn’t that great after a while.
---
Like others said, if we could have the talents/specs from BC in vanilla it would be good mix, but it wouldn’t be vanilla.
---
Have fun, we won't miss you.
---
Couldn't this theoretically be used as a streamdeck alternative if you had one?  Even though it's a bit more expensive...
---
gross, that's absolutely disgusting and not allowed
---
Its from ps Lightshope, but i saw Asmongold's stream wow beta and such addon worked. Clip you can see in this thread, someone posted it.
---
Skinning and mining is best unless you're gonna do alchemy later.
---
Great post, I'm sure you really thought this out before posting it here.
---
Yea, I see this one as an absolute win. Same with having to maintain the pet.
---
I feel sorry for you.
---
goldmakers never spend gold, that's for the gold buyers
---
Oh nice we have the guy who cries about everything
---
Edgemaster gloves, arcanite bars
---
I'll have to check it out. I've always loved Paladins. Main has been one ever since late Vanilla/TBC up until BFA. But after a while the healing just got a bit old. I liked the idea of prot or ret but seems that most info I've gotten has indicated its usually an uphill battle making either of those work (more so getting people to give you a shot in groups).
---
Soda has already mentioned that Blizzard was allowing them to reserve theirs early.
---
Epic!
---
The words of a druid that counts undead as allies cannot be trusted.
---
Sell it RMT 🤪
---
LOL aint anyone gonna pay you anything for Towelliee. You might get a vape pen and some gloves to abuse your wife so you can be just like him.
---
Pfft, c’mon. By that logic then Arthas is off the hook too, except for culling of strat, but those were all humans so why does the horde care?? If people are going to blame Arthas for his Lich kingyness then at least similar blame has to be granted to ner’zhul.
---
Ok bois whats the tactic to find the servers with the least amount of nazis?
---
I'm thinking womens names; any other ideas? what do nazis really dislike in Warcraft?
---
Create the sub the moment you find out the name of the realm you want to play on.
---
That's not how it works at all... Deep Wounds is 5% of your main hand weapon's damage, per second, for 12 seconds. It's really not a lot of damage, basically a free Rend.
---
Even Impale, 20% ability crit damage, isn't very good since abilities make up less than 20% of your total damage.
---
In PvE you're better off specing things like Imp Zerker Rage and Imp Intercept to generate more rage or improve uptime on fights with a lot of movement.
---
whatever their shield is, idk im not a priest
---
Funny thing is well know how many players they expect by the number of realms*5000. So we can all laugh when they undershot it.
---
DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO
---
I'm going to name my hunter's pet "Thex"
---
Thanks, added!
---
if the dungeon finder hadn't been implemented people would still be manually making groups and toxic people would be a) not getting groups b) relegated to groups with other toxic people. it's crazy to expect them to take it out now tho, i dont think the community would let them
---
The problem with Vanilla and PvP is the raid gear is the best way to be PvP geared, aside from the best PvP gear and the best PvP gear is nearly impossible to obtain. 
---
At some point MC and Ony Pugs will be common though I think, also at that point, lots of players will have tier 1/tier 2 gear. 
---
I think one drawback to keeping WoW exactly like the original is that there will be no new content to keep people progressing, and the item levels will eventually level out with lots of people with at least tier 1 raid gear. This will make it difficult for people in blue gear to be competitive in PvP.
---
I think part of these changes were less about balance and more about getting rid of the idea of support classes. If your class can do a role it has to do it as well as every other class that can do that role, instead of doing that role a little worse but bringing other shit to the table. Thats why I fell in love with shaman. I didnt want to be the best at whatever role I was doing, I wanted to be there with my team and make sure they were the best because of my help. When the warrior charged a big group of enemies I'd be there to throw in a heal, or a frost shock on that mage trying to get away, or a tremor totem to save him from the warlock in the back, the grounding totem to eat that aimed shot, and make sure he hits like a truck with windfury totem. Some of us really like being the dedicated support guy, but Blizz quickly gave up on trying to make that viable. Why bring a support when you can take a dedicated healer or dps? Because with the right toolkit it was so worth it.
---
**Region**: NA 
---
**Timezone**: West Coast / PST - Evenings Preferred.
---
**Server**: PvP
---
**Faction**: Either
---
**Looking for**: A hardcore PvP focused guild. (Emphasis that the PvP is the hardcore aspect). That is still capable to clearing relevant raids - to get the gear - to go back to PvPing better equipped.
---
Anyone can throw 200 players into a fight, but we are looking for a guild that is able to to more damage to the enemy faction, with less people. (Quality &gt; Quantity in PvP). 
---
**We are**: Right now I'm representing several personal friends and guildies from other games that all have the same passion: wrecking people in PvP. Regardless of if it is a FPS, MMO, or RTS - we all enjoy the thrill of PvP combat, going into tough situations and coming out on top.
---
I currently have about 5 hard yes's for Classic - and several more waiting in the wings to see how the game pans out. We all have substantial early WoW experience - most of us in Vanilla raiding through most of AQ40 / Naxx.
---
Currently my group is looking to play:
---
1. Rogue / Spriest (Either)
---
2. Pala (A) / Priest (H)
---
3. Pala (A) / Lock (H)
---
4. Mage
---
5. ??? (A) / Shaman (H)
---
If you are looking to form a PvP focused guild with the intention of dominating the server and making your enemy hate and fear your guild tag - please reach out to me.
---
Thanks,
---
Yeah, if you're a ret the only chance to endgame raid is to swing nightfall around all herpy derpy, as for protection... forget about it past level 40.
---
Only if you're east coast. 5pm for me and I get off at 5. My name is Bill on current wow. 0 chance I'll get that again.
---
YeS tHeY wIlL
---
lmao
---
Dunno what you mean, but its one addon that changes ui on this screen and its "modui".
---
You will only be desired in raids as a healer. You are lucky and getting carried by your guild if you are raiding as some other spec.
---
Being expected to heal a tiny guy named MrHuggymuffins.
---
The culling of Stratholme was a necessary evil. Had it been done by a commander who wouldn't deflect over to the scourge, it would have saved countless lives. The citizens of Stratholme were pretty much already dead.
---
Priest and warlock are really fun to level and are also have a great pvp toolkit by the time you hit stv
---
Kinda neat they're going with the original realmlist. I highly doubt i'll re-meet anybody on ysera i used to know but still gonna roll there for maximum nostalgia.
---
&gt; Like I said, it worked and it was fun but it was nowhere near as good as havin a Warrior.
---
Warriors tanks are getting worse in Classic what with the +10% parry chance! 
---
&gt; Nightfall has a very high proc rate when you are channelling Drain Life + Corruption (on one mob). Corruption ticks every 3 secs but Drain Life ticks every 1 second so the proc chance is very high.
---
Against 1 mob it's still somewhere in the ballpark of once every 20 seconds average.
---
&gt; You also get healing aggro on the rest of the mobs from Drain Life
---
Even counting healing threat, talented Drain Life barely gets to within 33% of the threat output of a talented Searing Pain. Although it is good if you want minor AoE threat in comparison to Searing Pain.
---
&gt; Nightfall makes Shadowbolt instant cast.
---
Still triggers a 1.5 second GCD, leaving you with nothing to do for the duration (which is why I said it basically halves its cast time which is normally 3 or 2.5 seconds).
---
&gt; There aren't "a ton" of Searing Pain talents. There's Improved Searing Pain which increases crit chance which is obviously good but without pushback protection it's only situationally useful.
---
Cataclysm and Devastation are both Searing Pain talents, and if you're Destro-heavy then Searing Pain benefits from Ruin and Emberstorm (dual-wield Fury Warr style).
---
Thanks a ton for sharing your experience and information you've gleaned from your attempt.
---
I has what the vast majority of other add-ons do in one package and is highly customizable. Bags, action bars, nameplates, move anything, raid/party frames, minimap, etc. are all there. Best is subjective but it is a solid option to just install one thing, tweak it, and be done with it (saves profiles too). You can swap in other specific add-ons like bagnon, vuhdo, etc later if you want and keep what you like. Its incredibly popular in retail.
---
You will have to wait for TBC:classic for spec diversity
---
They will all show as high pop. There's really no telling what each will be until a few months in. Once people start quitting you'll get a feel for what realms are high - med - low pop.
---
In the census, it's actually 52% horde and 48% alliance so the gap isn't that large
---
&gt;t’s no different than boss loot imo. 
---
Of course it is, boss loot can't be sold (or bought) for a significant amount of gold on the AH. If I win a warden staff even and I'm a warrior I can just sell the staff and fund my lionheart helm simple as that.
---
&gt;even though it’s no different than any gear their class uses
---
Hence why I don't expect people to pass me boes that my class could use just because of my class. If I'm playing a mage and staff of jordan drops I'm still telling everyone to roll need because that's what's most fair, everyone in the group has the same chance to win it.
---
spending Gold for mounts noggenfogger some epic items from ah, enchants for all items, repairs bags reskill.flasks and buff food.
---
for a good game to buy everything  i need between 3000-4000 Gold for one hero.
---
How do you put those icons next to your name?
---
Lol. That is indeed pretty awesome...don’t blame you.  Nevertheless, the factions wouldn’t have been galvanized as they are if the orcs didn’t come and essentially force alliances to be made amongst the races. Sure there were racial tensions in Azeroth already but that happens everywhere...like Draenor.
---
you're a tank, so tank.
---
if you're with a good group you'll be fine.
---
A single human was corrupted. Almost the entire race of orcs were.

---
*"Alright adventurers, the time for greatness is quickly approaching! Join with us to protect Azeroth. Grab your sword and fight the Horde!"*
---
We are an Alliance (NA) Guild that will be formed on a PvP realm at launch. We are a group of real-life friends and coworkers looking to build a fun and productive group of people that want to enjoy everything Classic WoW has to offer - from raiding to world PvP and battlegrounds, maybe a sprinkle of role-play to top it all off. We have experienced raiders from every expansion to noobies to Classic WoW. We plan on low pressure leveling - I mean lets stop and smell the roses, right? Although, I know there will be a few of us that will waste no time getting to level 60, we will not expect that from everyone. Once level 60, we will have our focus on farming Pre-BIS gear, maxing our professions, ranking up from honor farming, and helping guildies to reach level 60. Our goal is to progress through all raid and PvP content (BG premades).

I have a problem. I spend gold on ways to make more gold. Buying things that will be expensive in a month or two and hording them, buying out all of a mat important for levelling professions like black pearls, then posting 3 at a time.  I eventually amass a ton and start to spend on twinks maybe? I also fund guild.
---
She already didn't want to before she went in, then had a bad experience. How is she overreacting? If anything the experience justified her hesitation (in her mind at least).
---
This...this is just dumb.
---
You're making the assumption that theres no bleed over. That all retail players are only experienced with the current (or recent years, current) version of the game.
---
Some of us played Vanilla, or at least TBC, and continued to play retail (or at least off and on) through to retail today. We've seen the game change considerably from expansion to expansion, so your point isn't really accurate.

Oh yeah I expect classic to be more balanced than retail is currently.
---
There will be for sure

Same price. I don't recall bliz ever mentioning a cheaper sub. Think that was just people here asking for it.

I'm not playing Horde because I think it's right.

I'm playing Horde because that's who I am.

The Forsaken are the best because they're above such mortal foolishness as "honor".

You buy things for your friends. Or you buy raid drops (either as part of a guild or as a service from a guild to which you do not belong).

Roll a dice to decide, but you know, when the dice is still rolling you definitely wish for something.
---
To bad, you are NA  :/
---
That would be a nice change. I enjoyed that "talent preview" option.  Just in case I clicked too fast and the game was lagging, suddenly I put 3 points in when 2 was my goal. Whoops.
---
if you'd really take into consideration your guild you wouldn't play Ret/enh in raid but holy/resto

Mana Table

The way Disengage works in retail. It's like a get out of a falling death for free card.

Because it’s pog? Far more so than boring old vanilla...
---
i dunno if you'll be excited, you'll see how the internet has evolved now
---
**Region**: NA. Colorado
---
**Server**: PvE/PvP.
---
**Faction**: Alliance preferred.
---
**Class**: Mage, but also plan on a warrior alt
---
**Raid availability**: any day but Sunday and prefer starting after 8pm PST 9pm MST but can go as late as needed. I prefer only mandatory raiding 2 times a week with a third night being the exception rather then the rule
---
**Looking for**: Semi-hardcore/midcore raiding guild, with the majority of the guild being mature adults 25+ (I am 35 and not looking to play with a bunch of highschoolers). I want a guild that has a set of clearly defined looting rules that are followed. 
---
**Experience**: Hardcore raiding through WOTLK mained a warlock but have been a gamer all of my life and used to working with large groups having been a guild/clan/team leader for a variety of games. That said I'm not looking for or want a leadership role this time around.

For everyone who is new:

This elixir produces one of several random effects when drunk, including (but possibly not limited too):
---
- Slowfall for two minutes
---
- Shrinking you for 30 minutes
---
- Turning you into a skeleton form for 30 minutes (you can still attack or cast spells, but you can't mount or ride a gryphon/wyvern)
---
*zug zug*
---
May have just been US realms. That or failed memory cause I don’t remember them until later expansions.
---
Dont speak on behalf of others. Its really disrespectful
---
Wow I had no idea, thanks for clearing things up! I didn't want to be pigeon-holed into playing human, so I'm glad that's not the case. What are some sources of weapon expertise aside from racials? And how much do other dps classes typically have in an end-game scenario?
---
Sure it's not 3 minimum?
---

Won´t be in phase 1

lol @ 51 points in balance without Moonkin.

And what of Gul’dan???? Took two to tango in that dance muh dude—two demon-possessed individuals reaching across the universe to one another....nothing would stop them! their destiny was too great! It really is quite romantic.

Farming gold until there are consistent groups for dungeons, then gearing/attunements.

&lt;Centrally Planned&gt; | Horde | NA-PVP | 9:30-12:30 EST/6:30-9:30 PST (Tues/Thurs) | Semi-hardcore
---
Introduction: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; was formed by a group of folks who met playing modern wow, enjoyed each other’s company, and found communist memes amusing (For real though we have a lot of liberals/leftists. You for sure don't have to be. But if you get triggered by the existence of the left, that might be an issue).
---
Raid Schedule: We will be raiding two nights a week 9:30-12:30 pm EST/6:30-9:30 pm PST on Tues and Thurs. We will use loot council made up of a mix of officers and a weekly rotation of raiders with a focus on gearing tanks and healers first.
---
Player Expectations: We are listed as semi-hardcore because we all have lives and know some accommodations must be made for that. The officer core is made up of people who are neither in high school nor unemployed with the ability to no-life and play 24/7. That said, we expect people to come prepared with consumables and arrive on time. As we only will raid six hours a week, we need to be efficient and players should aim for 80%+ attendance.
---
The guild will be focused on the PvE content of the game but we are intentionally rolling on a PvP server as it is a pretty fun aspect of the game.
---
Ideally looking for:
---
&gt;2 fury warriors
---
&gt;
---
&gt;1 warlock
---
&gt;2 mages
---
&gt;1 resto druid
---
&gt;could likely fit one of anything into the core roster + I would like to shoot for a ~50 person raid roster
---
On Culture: &lt;Centrally Planned&gt; is centered around establishing a healthy and comical environment for those looking to progress through classic content with a semi-hardcore attitude focused on personal responsibility. We look to provide an inclusive atmosphere where homophobia, sexism, racism, and the like aren’t tolerated. You don’t need to have a bleeding heart, but if you can’t keep casual bigotry out of guild dealings, somewhere else would be a better fit.
---
If this sounds like a good fit, come say hey on our discord channel https://discord.gg/vmC5sMb

First video I saw was Grim's first one...lol

I'm going gnome and fully embracing their world view. We will wipe you scum off the face of Azeroth.
---
It's hard to convince people to get lost is the magic of MMORPGs but when they do they will get hooked. The main hook for me when I was first trying it out was the friends I made along the way. It's harder to quit something when you have such good friendships and people waiting for you to log in every day
---
Msa
---
It was just a guess, I don't remember the exact number and your statement isn't necessarily true. The pathing is made to kind of show off the zones and the wyverns often fly in unoptimized ways and not straight to the point. Besides Silithus was just an example, it's the flightpathing in general and they don't fly too fast either.
---
&gt;	Dont forget the forsaken slaughtering the last survivors of lordaeron after they helped them reconquer it.
---
Yeah, but they were racist assholes and deserved it.
---
&gt; Am I right to remember that Classic has a separate slightly cheaper sub rate for a stand-alone version? Or did they do away with that?
---
This was never a thing.
---
Gnomes are pure evil. Make one and embrace their master plan.
---
I play wow
---
Druid should be in the middle. You know, balance
---
A lot of good replies here. Another downside is at 60 if you change your mind and want your healer to dps you'll have an uphill battle ahead of you.
---
* In most pve scenarios you'll be more valuable as a healer than as dps. You'll probably make the runs longer, feel like you're holding your friends back, or get some hate.
---
* Finding healers can be hard so there's the lingering, "If you went back to heals we'd have a full group by now".
---
* And it sucks having to wait for groups to fill up. Healer LFG privilege is real.
---
You'll have a lot of work to do. Be prepared or make sure you want to heal on your healer. There's a lot of upsides if you're down for the cause.
---
Wait did I miss something?!?!? Name reservation was the 13th (Tues) and release date was definitely the 27th (again Tues).  Wtf is this 12th and 26th shit at 3pm??
---
Woah woah woah, you mention Benediction for priest, but not Rhok'delar and Lok'delar for hunters? The most epic quest in the entire game?
---
Yeah and blessings last for 5 hours, and hearthstones have 3 min cooldowns right???????
---
It is often said that an SSD is the biggest single upgrade you can make to a system, especially if you're running off a 5400 rpm laptop hard drive. The thing did have some serious driver problems and other issues bogging it down that the fresh install has eliminated, so that was also a factor.
---
Not true, bootlicker. Classic is a result of the large demand from nobodies populating private servers.
---
I love this story, I hope it's true.
---
i love defending red ridge but when its just a rogue who refuses to fight you its aids. as when you do finally hunt him down its gonna be another hour before you get him again
---
Fuck off and go monitor a hall or something
---
No you're not
---
Drinking demon blood and going on genocidal rampages is just an orc culture thing. These alliance people should stop being so xenophobic and learn to be multicultural. If that means a demigod has to die from time to time then so be it. Dont be on the wrong side of history.
---
&gt;top healing on the meters is from the best healers.
---
Almost always incorrect.
---
&gt;!Ner'zhul (spiritual leader of the Draenor Orcs) was tricked by KJ into believing the demon was his wife's ancestral spirit, and that the Draenei were about to turn evil.  Ner'zhul eventually shakes off mind control and attempts to stop KJ's orchestrated genocide of the uncorrupted Eredar, but his universally hated mentee, Gul'dan, betrays his teacher.!&lt;
---
I guess it’s pog for spergs.
---
Gotcha, thank you.
---
Damn, guess I mis-remembered. Thanks.
---
Retail moves a million miles per hour. If you quit you will have anxiety knowing how much has changed and how much grinding you have to do to catch up. It's not worth it IMO, that's why I'm waiting for classic.
---
All I want to do is pvp in stv
---
Who is crying just think your logic is dumb
---
I just jump on and run old content for mounts tmog while I wait seeing as the money has already been spent may as well get something out of the running time
---
I work shifts too. Lucky for me I got a lot of colleagues who want to swap with me. I'm thankful my schedule can be so flexible.
---
Felfire can't melt truesteel beams.
---
Wake up.
---
start a character with them.
---
Ah yes, but you claiming she was overreacting with as much information as me isn't disrespectful, I see. I was merely trying to offer a perspective you might not have considered.
---
What level?
---
Frost shock causes a debuff which can overwrite much more important debuffs.  On Bosses it's probably moot because bosses are slow-immune though.
---
Awesome! Thanks for reminding me of this
---
Alright there pitchforks, just trying to keep the subreddit clean. If you want to see a bunch of twitch stream promotions and razer naga ads, go right ahead
---
Back in the days, before the group finder, the server communities kind of kept track of who were toxic a-holes. So if someone misbehaved they got a bad rep and noone would party with them. Hopefully we can get back to this in Classic.
---
Ye it was probably multiple factors. PvP balancing, removing supportive natures etcetc. 
---
I hate it. IT came at the cost of class identity, RPG elements and needing others.
---
Or it’s just a duel and they can live with it - you can just laugh your ass off about it. 
---
I played shaman so all I ever had was NS, when rogues would want to wait between duels after beating me the first time I would say “okay so you’re admitting you can’t beat me without your full load, that’s fine” and just move along. If someone wants to bubble hearth during a duel, go ahead and just laugh at their expense
---
You know those people were about to turn into zombies, right? Killing them off right away was a good call.
---
Arthas did nothing wrong until he picked the frostmourne, that fucked him up really bad.
---
So your going to be taking your hand off one keyboard to constantly shift back and forth to another keyboard?
---
No offence but this looks like a stupid idea that will slow you down.
---
Just get a Razer Naga or other mmo mouse so you don't have to constantly be taking your hands on the keyboard.
---
I bet there is a bunch of keys around wasd that you never use or bind either which would be much more efficient than this.
---
Even in classic there were toxic people around. That's the nature of an MMO, even without cross realms. People will have different goals and methods to getting those goals and even that was found to offend people back then.
---
I'm hoping there's some reputation stickiness unlike retail, but make sure to ignore toxic people, make friends with the folks that you have in common with.
---
I did the following shift rotations in classic, 8-4:30, 11-7:30 and 3:30-12. Managed to raid with a competitive horde guild on my server. So yah... its doable.
---
Please explain to me how the Blackrock Orcs and their partnership with the Black Dragonflight has anything to do with the Alliance?  I believe Hakkar is the result of Trolls, which screams Horde as well.  And how is the faction with the Undead going to blame the Alliance for the Lich King and Kel'thuzad?
---
And don't even get me started about the Tauren and the Quilboars.
---
Technically the Lich King exists because the orcs lost when they invaded and then they betrayed the Legion. Also the Lich King was originally an orc warlock.
---
I've told this one before but as a warrior I didn't put 5 talents points into the no-brainer Cruelty talent (5% crit increase) because I only had a 5% crit chance by base and by my calculations increasing that by 5% would only give me an additional 0.25% crit chance.
---
I mean, if they play druid, I'm sure they wouldn't complain. Seems like they were joking, though.
---
I dont think I can handle a lot more of these threads.
---
I can't tell whether I hate the editing style or I love the editing style.   
---
Yes?
---
He was max level though :(
---
Shouldn't you be making a Druids can thread? No one cares
---
Haha, you already replied to me on a comment I made on your post :') cant wait to use your addon!
---
\^ What you did there?...I see it.
---
Me live in shit with spikes.
---
Me like shit.
---
If me not follow proper diet, shit morally grey.
---
Take it to r/classicwowRP
---
That was in the novel that was released for TBC that had the retcons of the broken ones//Eredar being one in the same when in WCIII and Vanila lore they were not. 
---
As of vanilla patch 1.12 and before the lore was the IRC’s were mind controlled into doing their deeds by the burning legion.
---
Wrong, the Orcs were already corrupted by demon blood and had the goal of conquering the world.
---
Orcs were led to Azeroth as reprisal for Azerothians thwarting the Burning Legion's first invasion.
---
What was the consumable that turns you into a rabbit? At least on PServers, it’s ridiculously OP for flag carrying. You can’t see the flag or their nameplate, and they turn into a critter sized rabbit.
---
Ironforge. Such a grandiose city.
---
Asking here instead of googling for info?  Sounds like you're better off playing retail.
---
Seriously, what is with people who look at healers as some sort of 2nd class citizen? For me it’s more fun than DPSing due to the balance of planning for the future (knowing when big damage is coming, utility spells needed etc.,) and reacting to unplanned damage / saving people. Meanwhile DPS is just doing their rotation the whole time.
---
This is literally what some people told me in this post without the jk part, I'm not even kidding. Unfortunately, toxic people will always be here.
---
Some guys go for the crazy ones though
---
Because it's a mmorpg.
---
Not about to be lectured on toxicity by a user of t_d, metacanada, shitpoliticssays, and pussypassdenied. What a toxic soup you swim in. Bye Felicia.
---
Yeah no you don’t get to say that, I’ve played prot and ret in vanilla and they’re unbalanced and useless in raids as prot and barely even useable as a dps option. Vanilla is the era of unbalance and anyone with a brain knows that the fact we have meme specs proves this
---
I think it was more stupid to pay to play a stress test server where you’d wait almost an hour or two to log in, play for only two days and get the character deleted after...which was months before the launch. 
---
People are fucking excited to make their permanent characters this time. It’s the price of a cheeseburger, fries and a soda....
---
Well, in 2004 WoW was the casual game with no grind. In 2019, Classic WoW's grind at least has an end. The lootbox titanforge mechanics of modern WoW mean you will never achieve completion.
---
This is what I use with the g600. Basically, I use the front 6 buttons for combat abilities. I use the back 6 for utilities (portals, professions, water, food etc...) &amp; then I use the side button on the right for polymorph instead of a modifier, since I already have tons of binds and don't really need to make use of the extra binds.
---
Avoid playing on a German server around 1940 I guess?
---
I remember back in the day a guy told me on wich server maydie plays. I made a char on this server and wrote him a letter how awesome he is. Never got a repl. To this day I don‘t know if it was the right server
---
I think he will :)
---
good call
---
It holds it for a month I'm pretty sure.

Not just any joke though, just internet jokes. Apparently.

Amazon is releasing a AAA MMORPG set in the world of Lord of the Ring.
---
Even though I can't wait for Classic I'll give it a try.
---
I'm not a druid but I do too...
---
If you need it (it is an upgrade and you’ll equip it then and there), then I’d say you’re justified to roll Need. If not, roll greed. If it wasn’t an upgrade for anyone, then everyone will have rolled greed.
---
priest - levitation
---
Well the sub will carry on and allow you to play classic when it releases, so you'll be paying 2 weeks up front and then you'll have two weeks of classic until your next sub

I just thought that it was cool that it was posted in 2007. That's some history right there. I don't know why you would infer anything else.
---
basically tbc
---
It'd be weird if you didn't
---
FOR THE KING!
---
PVE consumes are crazy expensive depending on how try hard you want to take it. Flasks in particular will cost hundreds of gold in classic, people won't be using them except for the hardest of content.
---
Reminds me of Calvin &amp; Hobbes lol

what do you mean by this? Like an addon that tracks this? Or an addon that auto buys you shit when your low an at a vendor?

What is lul short for
---
Nice list, thanks for this. I want to stress to raid healers how important Healcomm is!
---
Yikes.
---
In comparison to the expansions after Cata, yes Cata was the hardest.
---
"Teach me how to die" 
---
Instead, let me teach you how to read and comprehend.
---
"WoW was my favorite game to be ever created. Starting in cataclysm"
---
So, this means he never played prior right? Cataclsym was the hardest expansion he and or she played. Come on guy.
---
You throwing in your, "VANILLA WAS THE HARDEST THO" implication is just kind of, irrelevant? And yes.. There's an argument to be made that endgame Cata content was immensely harder than Vanilla's.
---
They’re likely referring to a ton of the optimization guides and posts.
---
It can seem pretty daunting when you see all these leveling routes, skill guides, talent trees, etc.  So these posts keep coming and they have every right to be here.
---
However, some very casual people, like myself, feel like it’s these posts dictating “how people should be playing the game.”  (It’s obviously NOT the case, but it kind of puts this fit-the-mold or GTFO feeling around the game.)
---
The counter posts are just the ones letting the other casuals know that they can be casual.  No requirements for guides or devoting your life to knowing the ins and outs.
---
TL;DR:  Guides make casuals feel they need to optimize.  Posts come out saying you don’t have to optimize and just have fun.  Comments on these posts then say they don’t ever see people saying how to play the game.  Both sides are right, but it’s not commonly communicated clearly where this all comes from.
---
Rogues I find too easy to deal with when felhunter is out.
---
Plainsrunning
---
CST = Central Standard Time
---
CDT = Central Daylight Time, only used when it's daylight savings time.
---
Same applies to other US time zones.
---
If they actually revealed themselves to be Shapeshifting Reptilians then I wouldn't even be surprised anymore.
---
I'd settle for in combat Charge personally.  Isn't Charge also really inconsistent in vanilla?
---
Druids can be good af at tanking and world PvP. That’s more than enough to keep someone busy. You probably don’t understand how good the class CAN because you never played it.
---
it me
---
Kidnap their closest friend/family and offer release on the terms of reaching 60 with you.
---
Druids can't actually tank or dps good as feral. But sure.
---
to get all blues and all keys and prequests
---
+dmg and +healing made that quite easy. MT prio healers get prio lewt
---
If anything mage is more spammy because you’ll be spamming frostbolt until you’re oom whereas rogue depending on spec you might be timing abilities with your swings and also you will sometimes be out of energy and press nothing while pooling. Which doesn’t happen to mages, you continuously spam as mage with no downtime until you’re out of mana.

40 man raids.

K. Hope the hunter rolls on all your warrior gear lol. Enjoy classic

My group has 4 if you’re interested, we’re adamant on a PvP realm.
---
&gt; Druid for a while could blink in cat
---
wtf?
---
Finally!
---
My original comment was meant to be flippant and funny and play on the stereotype Belves have gained. I’ve been a huge fan of Belves since WC3 and the only place they appear ‘flamboyant’ and ‘don’t touch my hair’ is in their /silly emotes which aren’t meant to be taken seriously anyway so I don’t have a problem with it.
---
lol QQ kid
---
They are healers in pvp. Ele is bad. Ench is half as good as a hwl warrior and far worse before you get the gear.
---
Victory for Sylvanas!
---
It's been so long but I do remember it having issues, especially when used against moving targets.
---
Will Blizzard add a third faction?
---
Will Blizzard introduce interstellar travel?
---
Will Blizzard set fire to their headquarters?
---
We may never know.
---
Ahh sorry bud just looking for 2
---
Fair enough, but I feel like that should have been made more clear.  The game is a US game it should be fair to assume if they say 27th it's US 27th and the global date might be later depending on time zones.  This is the first I've seen a date and time and it's a little late to swap days off work.
---
Will be an honor to heal my alliance brethren through the darkest and deepest dungeons.
---
[See you all there!](https://tenor.com/view/wow-for-the-alliance-gif-11541819)
---
oh right, sorry about that, Yeah i guess its still over 13 years ago it was uploaded, crazy to think wow has been around for so lonmg.
---
I don't; but time will tell.
---
Raiding is the clear endgame? For me, PvP is the clear endgame, and Raiding is just the means to equip the best gear for PvP. So for a Shaman, you would use Resto spec to raid, and then either stay Resto or go Elemental for PvP.
---
Not positive but I had a character with 2 letters in cataclysm at one point.
---
&gt; I understand the balance idea of it for PvP but my god is it lame for actual gameplay.
---
I blame arenas. They had to make it even meanwhile in 10 v 10 wsg or 15 v 15 ab it doesn't matter
---
hunters have mana and meaningful pets
---
We’ve known for weeks.
---
orcs yes, darkspears are basically just potheads.
---
Valuable BoE items = everybody needs. Always.
---
That’s the forsaken fam. Different faction
---
If you’re a priest and decent you’ll have to deal with the annoyance of people constantly whispering you to come heal their dungeon. Sometimes even people who just found you on /who. Can be a good thing though, but sometimes you just want to chill alone and solo queue some bgs or farm some professions.
---
AKCTUALLY, every major conflict in Warcraft up until Warcraft 3 and the first couple of expansions are directly related to The Burning Legion in some fashion. 
---
Like that South Park episode on the Simpsons episode, "LEGION DID IT."
---
Warcraft I - Burning Legion corrupts orcs and uses them to attack Azeroth.
---
Warcraft II - Burning Legion Plan Electric Boogalo 2. 
---
Warcraft III - Burning Legion creates the Lich King and uses the undead to try to attack Azeroth again. 
---
Warcraft III Frozen Throne - The Burning Legion's creation has run amok, but it was their creation that started those problems. 
---
Onyxia - daughter of Deathwing. Deathwings corruption was done by the Old Gods because they wanted to lure the Burning Legion to Azeroth to use them to escape their imprisonment. She is a product of that attempt in conjunction with the Burning Legion. 
---
Nefarion - same deal.
---
Ragnaros - actually I don't think the Burning Legion had any hand or influence in this. Just crazed Dwarves (not associated with the Alliance mind) that had a hand in this. 
---
Lich King and the WotLK expansion - Burning Legion did it. 
---
Kel'Thuzad - Created by the Lich King who was created by the Burning Legion. 
---
Hakkar - Separate deal. That's a Troll thing.
---
Cataclysm - Deathwing's madness is a product of the old gods using him to get to the Legion. 
---
MoP - same deal. The mists were put in place to protect Pandaria from the sundering caused by the Legion. 
---
WoD - Garrosh tried to prevent the corruption of the orcs by the Legion but still ended up failing. (I AM INEVITABLE! - ~~Thanos~~ Kel'jaden) 
---
Legion - LEGION DID IT.
---
BfA - ...I...well. Legion is gone now so...
---
Yep, definitely exaggerated
---
I agree, the dungeons were incredibly fun and required strong tactics even at the 5 man level.  On top of this though, each piece of gear upgrade I got made me feel amazing.  Especially when it was that one BIS pre-raid item or whatnot.  Satyrs Bow, Voones Vice Grips, Savage Gladiator's Chain, or other hard to get items that everyone is jealous of because they've been grinding it for weeks.  These items were even more exciting for me than MC gear.  I didnt get this sort of "high" back until Blackwing Lair.
---
LMAO
---
I thought Rain of Fire did damage that scaled on the size of the enemies, because bigger targets would get hit with more of the fire.
---
Lies, there was only speculation, for weeks.
---
"Shockadin" = worse Fire Blast every 30 seconds
---
Good stuff right there! I was a NE hunter back in the day as well and I just loved shadow melding, also had the rare Saber from winterspring with stealth so we would get up to some borderline rogue like business in bgs just like you described. Wicked fun!
---
If it's hunter for me this time it'll most likely be Orc, however. I'll miss shadow meld but extra pet damage and stun resist isn't half bad either. Also I can get a badass wolf that'll fit my character perfectly.
---
Not a hardcore rp player but I like to match pets with race, and look good.
---
Beast stalker/master will look awesome on my orc too I reckon (female).
---
All these moral arguments are honestly superfluous. All anyone needs to know: If it's red, it's dead.
---
Its against the TOS to impersonate someone. It saves them work and drama from having to deal with name thieves.
---
These guilds will be devastated by all the ret paladins and enhancement shaman not joining
---
As I have stated multiple times, this blanket statement is not viable for some classes.
---
To get to 40 THERE WILL BE FARMING, you will always need to stop and farm extra mobs to fill in the quests.
---
That being said, for warrior and rogue, the best use of time, because at the end of the day gold=time, is often to buy a weapon to fill the void from quests and vendor purchases weapons. Often you can find from someone or on the AH a weapon that is 1.5-2x vendor price, which is equivalent to BUYING it from a VENDOR, something that is included in most leveling guides.
---
For hunters, yes, sell all your shit, dont buy shit, etc. etc.
---
But as you offered advice for other classes (buy a wand) I wanted to set the record straight for the classes I have the most experience for.
---
My advise would still be, dont waste 3-4 hours trying to kill something at the low 30s with the quest reward from lvl 22. You will speed up getting your mount (which is the ultimate goal after all) if you spend 2-5g on a significantly better weapon, which sill only take 20-30 mins of farming to off set.
---
All in all, -3:00 hours + 30 mins = 2:30 minutes faster to get level 40 and get your mount.
---
Aspect of the Cheetah probably

They only have a limited number of data centers, so you should have the same ping to all servers at that data center. You could probably test your ping to a server on retail at that data center, and it should be the same for classic.
---
I always liked being ranged back in the day...but nothing instilled more envy in me than being crit by a 2h melee. It's just devastating.
---
The echo would drive me insane.
---
While I like this post and think it's interesting, there is nothing wrong with someone starting a discussion about whether it's advertising. That's what the comments section is for. I get that constant rehashed memes and being able to go through a sub in 2 minutes doesn't make for great content, but a sub flooded with ads is much worse. Remember when the league of legends sub first started and every front page post was some shitty kotaku or pcgamer article upvoted by a thousand bot accounts? That is what happens when the community doesn't pay attention. /u/powerwordjon is correct that it's a short step from this sort of fan made stuff to bot promoted posts about logitech macro keyboards with server time on the LED display and gawker articles about the underrespresentation of Tauren amongst non-druid classes.

Someone is excited to get their free in-game pacifier and inflatable sword for joining the alliance I see. For the Horse!
---
Using my body to get DKP
---
But that is sarphog's point. People who were playing in Vanilla have watched the game change into its current retail form. People playing the current retail game have not watched it slowly transform into WoW Classic.
---
Wpvp
---
You can go ahead and buy it on the AH like the rest of the people. Valuable BoE items = everybody needs always. I say that as a warrior. Whom will have a lot more to lose out on then a druid. It just is the way it is.
---
Its against the TOS to impersonate someone else.
---
Letting them reserve names just saves Blizzard customer support the tickets.
---
Honestly, I like playing with newbies and first-timers.
---
It makes me feel all smart and accomplished and like I know a lot, when I get to share that knowledge with others.
---
There's a special kind of satisfaction in taking a group of people who have never seen the content you're running before and being the reason they clear it. 
---
WoW is, was and always will be a game about teamwork and communication- you don't master it by topping the DPS meters and knowing more about tactics than everyone else, you master it by sharing what you know and improving everyone else in your party. 
---
Knowledge is one of the game's most important buffs, and anyone who has it can cast it on others. Sometimes it even stacks. 
---
It's useful in a group if everyone states how well they know (or don't know) what they're doing up front.
---
Encourage others to speak up, and be willing to explain things- often people who admit to not knowing what they're doing will end up picking it up quite quickly once they've had a nudge in the right direction, moreso than people who think they know everything already.
---
(Also if anyone happens to want a tank friend who loves talking people through content, get in touch. ❤️)
---
&gt;My experience of vanilla AV was mostly stalemates in the middle were we kept moving from one side of the field of strife to the other back and forth trying to push through.
---
A man of culture
---
And that's all? If so, then does it really matter if it can be fun?
---
Sounds like a free weapon swing every 10 seconds that ignores armor.
---
The time spent skinning at lower levels is actually a gold loss vs. farming at 40.
---
Thick and Rugged is where you start to make money, because this is where the leveling of leatherworking slows down, and requires more mats.
---
You are better off, long term at least, only skinning to skill up before 250ish.
---
You mean that little pipsqueak that hangs out with his evil dragon babysitter? Nice role model ya got there.
---
Probably because the **main classic post already tells you this information**
---
&gt;We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, **but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!**
---
And they just assumed you had the ability to read.
---
All of them
---
So was the Horde.
---
Well that’s unenforceable nonsense.
---
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they base their decision off of how many people go through with the name reservation.
---
Free Imp Sap for everyone and Stealth not costing movement speed.
---
“Closer to launch” doesn’t mean before name reservations. Nooooob
---
How does this save your world buff
---
Yeah, flying islands with landing zones.  you have to walk across them to quest and if you want to fly you have to go back to your landing zone to fly off
---
Garithos did nothing wrong
---
...or you can play alliance/pve with your wife.  Either minmax for pvp or play with you wife, pick one.
---
The short answer is no. If you’re interested in being a 3 minute wonder roll mage.
---
AQ Trash
---
In my ~7 or so years of playing world of warcraft, I have NEVER seen any variation of any of those names you posted my dude. Them getting special treatment saves every body headaches down the line and keeps wow classic from turning into a drama filled shit storm.
---
Not talking about BoEs that is nonsense. We are talking about items that can net 300-500g. You can farm 3g in no time at all. 
---
People have different views on this and I get it. The best thing to do is clear this kind of stuff up before grouping up. I personally believe it is fairest if everyone has a shot. If you don't then we won't group up. Simple.
---
Yep, they assumed too much of you. I bolded the part for you to read and for some reason you chose to focus on the unbolded portion.
---
I knew you would struggle with this one but I tried anyways. Good luck my dude.
---
I still don't fully understand the Deathwing's back fight.
---
You can do that for like about 12.99€/month
---
Unfortunately this is true. Either you're a dick or you're not. Telling someone not to be who they are isn't going to make a difference.
---
I think there's gonna be a lot of warriors since you can reserve your name fastest without selecting class
---
iirc it was added back in cataclysm whenever they released RBGs but i could easily be mistaken.
---
I think TBC had incredibly well-done balance. I love that shadow priest had it's very specific benefits enough to be viable. Ele, enhance, ret, boomkin, feral are all the same. Good enough that people were basically as willing to bring them along as people were willing to roll them. Ret was overplayed with less spots but I enjoyed ret so much I was willing to compete for the spot. In vanilla I wouldn't go that far to compete for a spot as ret (I'm not saying it's impossible but I'm not interested in that)
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
Druids have shorter digestive tracts that let them eat things that humans wouldn't be able to, like raw chicken.
---
I agree that people are going to beat his record, seems obvious. But your last 2 points are really bad.
---
1) Comparing retail AOE grinding to that of Vanilla is laughable, your character is a god in retail and almost unkillable it feels like with all of the healing/abilities and damage you have. Not the same at all not even close.
---
2) Siting private server times must always come with an *, many of them have been proven to use inflated xp values on some of those speed runs. Anyone thinking that the half as fast speed runs on private servers are legit should think again.
---
You tried and failed. I understand nothing.
---
Hopefully my boosters are ready to get me 60 in a week 😜
---
You weren’t even old enough to play classic when it was first out lol. Asking people if some private server bug is gonna be in the game. lol get out of here. Probably just got your learners driving permit my dude
---
I played druid in from classic through cata. You are picking and choosing what points to argue. Noone is saying druids can't do the things you are talking about. There is no real argument for druids being balanced. Moonkin is not viable in any capacity, feral druid is relegated to offtanking, and the best in slot threat weapon is from gnomeragon, and resto druid is strictly worse than the other healers. Can you tank 5 mans and off tank raids, yes. Can you heal in raids and 5 mans, yes. Is the class balanced to be inline with other strong classes? Not by a long shot.
---
I was vote kicked out of my first dungeon in wrath and was my first time healing and was garbage at it. Was embarrassing and I'm an avid player, it made my wife not want to play at all. I let her know that was the first dungeon in a long time people have been so toxic. I'm hopeful that classic will be better because it has to. It's been stated here before that people will learn really quick that you can't play like you can play on retail and it will either make or break those types of players.
---
If you don't have anything to do between darkshire and the graveyard, it's actually quicker to fly from darkshire to westfall and then run to the GY.
---
It will be a gain in value, yes, but the same tme spent farming at 39 or 40 will net more gold vs. the cumulative time for all those 2-3s skinning beasts in your 20-30s.
---
This is similar to the saying the "Bill Gates loses money if he stops to pick up $100 bills"
---
Lmao, okey, so if anyone takes the name I plan to use, then I can report them for impersonating me?
---
Streamers are not celebrities lmao.
---
I’ll reserve three characters on the Thex-RP-PvE-Realm. What about you guys?
---
Looking forward to the «horde overpopulated servers», «Horde OP racials» posts and more Alliance crying.
---
There are pieces that are plate for healing, you get best of both worlds, and specially leather healing gear!
---
There may be an argument to be made here but in the end, you don’t *need* that money while the warrior will use those gloves forever. You might have a point if you were using that money to buy your own bis or upgrades and not consumes because we can all agree that consumes are less important than gear.
---
However if we’re going by your own metric that 8/10 boe items are warrior items it’s very likely that you don’t *need* that money on the same level that the warrior needs the gear since you’re likely not buying gear.
---
But even if you are buying that 2/10 item it’s still greedy because a piece of gear in someone’s hand is inherently worth more than gold in someone pocket equal to the amount to buy that gear, as a result your taking something inherently less valuable to you from someone who would find more value in it. Why is this the case? Well take it like this. Edgemaster will not always be in the AH, but gold will always be farmable. And speaking of farming gold, what’s the class which is the worst at farming gold? You guessed it! Warriors! By an absolute long shot. Essentially you just took a piece of gear that was inherently worth less to you to make your life a little easier while also making someone else’s life way harder. 
---
Oh oh, and let’s take that logic about need vs greed you were using there and take it to it’s extreme. If money is a valid reason to need, why shouldn’t a warrior roll need on everything? Bop vendor for a relatively small amount but it can certainly add up. And especially if the warrior is being forced to buy all his boe bis items because everyone keeps rolling need on them. And taking that 8/10 stat (which I have no idea is true if it’s not your argument of “since most boe items are warriors we all should get to roll on them” falls apart *anyway*) warriors seem to be in the most need of money and the least able to get it when it comes to gear thus justifying rolling need on everything I guess. 
---
In the end you’re making someone’s life way harder to make yours a little easier and that will always be a dick move in my eyes.
---
Hey come on now, they're good guys too. Sargeras just wants to make sure the void lords don't hurt us. :)
---
Yeah I'm definitely struggling with this decision right now. Also the name reservation unlocks at a super inconvenient time for me.
---
I'm thinking I'll wait a week, sub 3 or 4 days before the official launch and get a name then. I'll hopefully avoid the casual mass of reservations on launch day.
---
It subjective what is no time at all. The worth of certainan amount isnt the same for all the people. I agree on establishing the rules beforehand, as it seems its very 50-50 how people view this issue. I just dont understand what would be the point of the greed roll, if not rolling for money.
---
Oh, I can assure you that there will be tons of drama in Classic.
---
It's the principle of special treatment. The whole idea of Classic is everyone being equal adventurers.
---
Warrior would be best but will require pocket heals. Hunter and mage will be great solo due to high CC and range. Rogue will be great in wpvp but meh in BGs. Also when everything is on cd you aren’t that useful.
---
Who you choose to associate with in your free time is a big deal.

Been raiding BWL to naxx so flipping hard I know the tacos and skips of every dungeon and raid by heart.
---
Yep I’m ready reroll class
---
There better be at least one RP realm that sounds very Horde-y! I can't wait to see the selection though either way.
---
Yeah.  Why haven't you broken out everyone else?
---
Isn't enhancement one of the best DPS classes in TBC?
---
Yeah, I'm quite sure the 14 day reservation time is to estimate how many players / servers they need. And if they add more before release one will be RP PvP for EU and NA.
---
So hopes not our yet!
---
It seems like it could get unnecessarily complicated, but it depends on how you want to spend your time. You could farm cloth for turn-ins instead, or farm whatever you enjoy farming for gold to buy cloth for turn-ins.
---
I'm going to need you two to settle this in the Gadgetzan arena.

Been playing around with a Warrior stunlock meme-build: 25/5/21

---
The idea is to dual-wield maces (did anyone say Ironfoe + Hand of Justice?) and combine mace stun + revenge stun + concussion blow so you can be a "rogue in plate". I know, I know, this is probably a garbage spec for various reasons. I suspect those abilities share diminishing returns, not to mention a total lack of any good offensive abilities. Prepare to stance-dance a lot!
---
Can you update this with the server you choose? I'm PST and would love to join a server full of similar timezone people.
---
That's what I get for being on mobile xD not correcting it, epic auto correct
---
Does it extend if you actually log in and play the character a bit? Because by then it’ll be an actual player no?
---
He removes buffs, he can’t remove DS nor Hakkar but it can save your 200AP from diremaul
---
It doesn't matter. It got old days ago and we can let it die.
---
I don't get it dad.
---
Neither do I son....But it sounds cool
---
Hopefully they sneak in RP-PVP and enhance hype instantly.
---
Funny cause I remember playing my mage on week 2 or 3 after launch.... HMMM
---
You're such a sad person lol
---
Greed is for an item that you don't need. Say a BoP robe drops but you don't need it. Maybe your current one is better or you don't wear robes. It's basically a "if nobody needs it I'll take it" button. BoEs are way too valuable to just let whoever can use it use it. I don't think we will be changing each other's minds here so it's probably best we stop.
---
Gotta farm them light feathers
---
Plug in my phone on and play on data. 
---
Did it alot then I was a firefighter in the Army. We had some long drives from time to time, had my laptop with me and kept the grind going while on the road. :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjrmyv/character_creation_in_2_weeks/
---
&gt;Do you think I will blame just the hunter for that?
---
Yes. That is who made the mistake. Though I guess if you are not paying any attention as a healer it could wipe the group. If a hunter is pulling mobs to you move to the side. They will silence you if they walk right next to you so the very simple way for you to avoid that wipe is to move. Why would you blame someone else for the hunter wiping or attempting to wipe your group. Even if a warrior tries to taunt it, it might miss and then everyone is dead anyway. The only solution guaranteed to work is for the dps to follow the marks on the targets. But fyi you can blame whoever you want for the wipe, crying wolf won't give a good tank a bad reputation
---
10 min and 2 for slow fall
---
I sure hope so
---
Paladins having seals and auras
---
I never did this shit in vanilla but my god private server people refuse to do the shit normally. Unless I’ve just had over 30 bad runs
---
Region: NA.
---
Server: PvP.
---
Faction: Alliance.
---
Class: Druid, feral preferred but willing to heal and/or tank.
---
Raid availability: Evenings in CST, usually ~9p-12p. Can play longer on the weekends.
---
Looking for: Semi-hardcore/midcore raiding guild with some PvP groups as well. Have multiple friends that plan on playing with me and likely want to raid/PvP as well, including a warrior, paladin, hunter, and rogue.
---
Experience: Raid experience up to a couple Naxx bosses. Cleared Onyxia, MC, BWL, some AQ40. Experience tanking, DPS’ing and healing. Achieved Field Marshal rank in Vanilla PvP as main flag runner. Friendly and competent player looking to find a good group and have some fun!
---
I played Heroes of Newerth exactly \*once\* because of essentially the same experience.  In a non-ranked game!
---
Accurate male to female ratio lol
---
Man I hope BC and WoTLK servers are being considered after WoW Classic's run.   
---
Just QoL classic until it's in a 'perfect state', then roll out BC servers and do the same thing until we reach Cata.
---
Yeah but hitcap for taunt was easy to get (especially with glyph)
---
There actually *is* reason for those two in particular, although the same logic can't neatly extend to all classes in the current formatting; that is, there are more hunter options on Horde, more rogue options on Alliance.
---
Usually people do that on Discord these days (on pservers)
---
Even better, many of the most hardcore will be doing dungeon leveling with pre-planned groups.
---
Hopefully he keeps his attitude off of the NA servers. :P
---
Yes, one that can't crit, doesn't generate rage, and is every 20 seconds, not 10.
---
It adds ~2% damage, not even close to the proposed 8-20%.
---
Grom did order them to de-forest a shit load of the forest for lumber though lol - if you played the warcraft 3 campaign
---
Yes but a rogue will press a button every 1 second while a mage has frostbolt cast time and effectively presses 1/2
---
A chunk of playerbase don't want to see any QoL changes and here you speak about changing endgame mechanics.
---
tell them "you don't think you want to play it, but you do"
---
Naming my troll shaman Xeht just for shits but I imagine I don't need to reserve that
---
I’m ready to not have more of these posts
---
I always found folks that played mage had rogue alts and vice versa.
---
Class and even character identity.
---
I like the idea but Blizz isn't going to canonically make Retail doomed just for Classic players lol.  
---
Retail is just going to divert into it's own path, I wouldn't be surprised if next expac does something drastic lore-wise sorta akin to what Runescape 3 has done compared to OSRS over the time.
---
for flagcarry, is there any situational use for one or both of the +armor trinkets?
---
The people that dont like getting ninjad?

---
That's some pretty heavy stuff.
---
I'll be rocking out to the wonderful soundtracks and ambiance of each zone, cause nothing gets you more immersed then the specifically hand-crafted tunes.
---
You're just wrong.
---
Modern WoW suffers because the game doesn't start until endgame, which makes the levelling process essentially an obstacle to get to the actual game, and that's how it's treated. Coupled with that, the end game content is just a more obtuse level grind, but feels far less like a coherent adventure or story, and more like a collection of chores that you do routinely in order to unlock more chores. 
---
You're never really Done. There are no real milestones. You just keep doing the same stuff hoping what you want will happen by chance.
---
It feels like it was so recently that I was starting at the 100 days countdown. So much has happened since then. Goldshire Dog, release date, the great layer debate, the hunter bugs, the beta duel competition, the closing of the beta, the Thex meme.
---
It's been a wild ride. I can't wait to finally play.
---
Hp/mana regen become faster around cataclysm or pandas. Also most classes now have some kind of autoheal so water isn't so necessary.
---

Pressing the key harder makes your Sinister Strike hit harder.
---
Keep lifting!
---
I'm also super butthurt about the shitty flying unlock system.  I get that a lot of people dislike flying, but the cats been out of the bag longer than it was in the bag for, and I never saw an issue with the "Get level cap, pay a gold sum to unlock flying".  I can't be bothered with grinding 16 factions shitty daily quests to revered/exalted to get account wide flying.  Just let me pay 50k (or whatever number Blizzard deems appropriate) per character at level cap and be done with it.
---
LAP (or FAP if you manage to dot him).
---
Do we know if NA realms will be designated by timezone? Such as east, central, and west realms?
---
I'll settle for "thethex"
---
When you are in STV, the whole world is a pvp video... You need to get entertained! :p
---
I thought we were on a thread made to complain about classic mechanic You can tell me I'm wrong, that it's a good mechanism, but don't tell me "No change because I said so"
---
Plus, this was not a mechanics, but a technlogy limitation. It wasn't made purposely
---
*Looks at Garrosh*
---
Just because it sucked for your server doesn’t mean it did for mine. Criss realm ruined pvp for me. I’m not proving shit for you. I don’t care why they did it. I hated it then and I hate it now. Look what cross realm did to retail.
---

All you need, you can thank me later
---
What's going on in the last picture with the blue chains and skull covering the door?
---
Mage is only faster if you can aoe, gl with that shit and that's coming from a mage that's taking the week off to level. Priest is blazing fast compared to mage, warrior, and rogue due to 0 downtime.
---
Idk what you are talking about, most private server hardcore players i have seen have complained that dungeons on beta were too easy. Dps pulling everything on private server isnt a thing because it's a guarenteed wipe unless you are in a strong group that knows what they are doing, Meanwhile on the beta you can pull a whole room without dying because elites hit twice less.
---
Yeah, the first day of the wotlk pre patch was huge for ret.
---
Just the SoC animation made it clear that you're going to destroy your next target. It had the nice explosion vfx which was removed shortly after.
---
I got it in 3min version in the playlist :)
---
This is how it already works in Vanilla private servers, though..
---
gonna make a Tauren and call him thexybeast
---
I think my keyword was just classic wow server names. Went to a number of other threads on other sites. One of which has the blue posts and the exact same discussion.
---
No. 
---
Blizz have stated that they will not be fixing/balancing/touching Classic in any way. Classic will stand as mirrow into the past. 
---
And I wouldnt have it any other way.
---
Yea, and that was retconned for Legion. 
---
Originally, the Legion existed to absorb planets of their magical essence, resources, and snuff out all life because that's what they do. 
---
And Sargeras was corrupted because he got tired of being the jailer and "fixing shit" when it didn't look like it would ever end. There were always "bad" forces in the universe and he was tired of it being a never ending quest. 
---
That was retconned for Legion. Instead, the Legion was designed because Sargeras found out about the void and their plans to corrupt a titan. For whatever reason, corrupting a single titan would be enough for the entire universe to go to shit, so he decided to just destroy everything. 
---
Blizzard wanted to "shake" things up by introducing a character that had some "gray areas" to their ideology. This is actually a trend you'll see in movies in recent years (Thanos in Infinity Wars, Killmonger in Black Panther of the top of my head).
---
Blizzard is continuing with that style of villain in their current expansion too with Sylvanas. 
---
I understand why they would need to revamp their 20 year old main bad guy, but I think they did it in the worst way possible.
---
So....  first toon was a hunter. When I was less than level 10 I had a green boe bow drop, nice right!?  I went to equip it and the dialogue box pops up warning that equipping the bow will bind it to me. Thinking I was going to have a cursed item in my hands that I wouldn’t be able to remove I never equipped that bow.
---
Ahh that makes much more sense now thanks! 
---
And how does the priority system work? So why is it that with [@mouseover, harm], it hits the mouseover target instead of the selected target?
---
Only 8 more days of work!
---
Sorry we do stuff in the world besides be homeless and pathetic. Think about it. The only people that belong on azeroth is tauren and maybe trolls. Orc shouldnt be here. Neither should undead. Trolls are so bad they got taken in by the homeless orcs. 
---
Not to mention everything was fine until the orcs showed up on azeroth... 
---
If you don't like azeroth leave
---
Ya but the meme npc testicle huggers are still using it strong. It is interesting however to watch a meme trend across the internet and watch the lemmings fall over the cliff over it.

Not yet new computer will arrive in two days then gtg.
---
Not only do you have to get a key, the 3 parts to the Seal of Ascension are unique drops to a single player in the party.
---
Most streamers will be trying to hide their servers for as long as possible, eventually chat will figure it out by one of them running into them in a starter zone and saying it on screen or in chat, but this would be a good tool if you're starting a day or two, or maybe even a week after launch, not for reserving your names honestly
---
See I wouldn't actually mind getting into PvP more and focusing on it, but I'm not really sure how the scene works in classic. I heard that BGs won't be available for the first phase or two of classic so that is off-putting as well. How does the PvP gear progression work? Do you acquire it based on your ranking? Thanks
---
First dungeon at lvl 87 ? There's a reason dungeons start from lvl 15 you know...

And that's to learn.

Epic mount, engineering/enchanting, and raid consumables.
---
I envy you
---
You can't make someone play a game they're not interested in. If the issue is that you weren't playing together because you're higher level and they only want to play when you're both on then make a new character to play with them, though that sounds like they're doing it just to play with you and might prefer to play a different game.
---
I absolutely agree. Tbc without flying would be fucking marvelous. It absolutely ruins world pvp
---
But, you may be able to be the Nightfall dude. 
---
I am looking forward to doing pvp with my warrior friend, the horde scum on this sub seems to fear that combo alot. :)
---
Based on behavior of the client during the stress tests (servers live before the start, allowing character creation but "world not yet available" or something similar) the character name reservation will involve actual character creation in the client.
---
Professions matter.
---
Leveling
---
My guess is that Fartrand is the guild leader
---
I'm gonna be completely honest here, the thing I'm not looking forward to is the kids who will say "this is shit, it takes to long, bfa is better". I mean they never went thru this when this was retail. But instead of flaming them or getting angry. I'll try just to ignore them.
---
Wouldn’t this be plausible if you weren’t doing any dungeons or grinding?
---
Hate to tell you buddy but guilds that are "shift friendly" are extremely rare. The fact of the matter is that working around one person is manageable, but working around more than that is nearly impossible.
---
I would compare it to playing Dungeons and Dragons. It's nearly impossible to find a group of 4 people who can meet every week on the same day. It's even more difficult if each person does shift work. If you have even 2 people in a guild that have variable shifts, then you have to 1) hope that they both get an evening off on the same day and 2) hope that the rest of the guild is okay with raiding on that day.
---
Guilds are going to choose 2 nights a week that are raid nights, and if you can't make it, you can't raid. It's a shame, but it's just the reality of organizing 40 people. It's far too difficult to organize variable schedules.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
Preach
---
So this is the hill you choose to die on? Interesting.
---
Arena would be 100% possible even on a competitive level even if classes stayed different from eachother due to it being a team game and not 1v1s but Blizz apparently didnt understand that idk
---
In TBC the talent worked against dispels
---
We used a Warlock tank back in Vanilla for our server first kill of the Twin Emps in AQ40, to handle the caster dude.
---
That's it. That's all they should be used for if needed. But, goodluck n finding a guild willing to hand-hold you through the process of MTing as a Warlock. Also sorry for that guild, they aren't gonna get too far.
---
Yes, I don't understand why people want the phases rushed.  We should all just take our time and enjoy this.  I am going to min/max while also enjoying each zone again and grinding rep/professions/all kinds of stuff.  I work a ton so I really don't want a ton of content constantly being added with no time to see it all.  I'd much rather things be drawn out.
---
“Not me, but I knew a guy” 😏
---
Death Grip
---
&gt;Most streamers will be trying to hide their servers for as long as possible
---
Are you sure about that? I haven't heard that at all so would appreciate a source on that if it's alright. My understanding is that most streamers (Asmongold and Esfand, Tipsout, Sodapoppin, etc) will be very transparent about where they'll be playing so that everyone knows what they're in for. And besides that, they'll be streaming from day one for maximum hype (and thus maximum $$$ for them), and /who is a thing that exists so it'll be known within the first few hours of launch.
---
Asked to death. Roll shadow for faster leveling (get wand spec too). You can heal just fine until endgame when you can respec holy if you want.
---
Or level as Holy - just will be slower.
---
NA or bust
---
Both are a great asset to any group.  I like paladin because as a holy/prot spec you can pretty much do it all (save for tank raids).
---
Nice , shaman and lock horde for sure. 
---
Unsure about that druid call though, I mean the big names in lore that are druids tend to be Night elves. 
---
Priests could be closer to the middle too and rogues maybe more horde cuz  Garona. Hunter I see as horde but also as Alli cuz the dwarf in opening cinematic! Lol . 
---
Well done though, sorry for adding my two cents I know no one asked.
---
I wasnt planning to sub until launch day. Does that mean I cant claim character names? I wouldnt want to use up a week of gametime between this and launch.
---
Best way to counter a dwarf stoneforming your blind, is to gouge+ magic dust
---
some of the posts I have seen recently were using Coordinated Universal Time (UCT). just one of the things we consumers have to be aware of when parsing data. Not like it's a big deal in any event, whats a few hours between friends?

Yeah thinking about it, you are right. Just had to think about what eviscerate did 😉
---
Then shouldn't druid and rogue be switched?  Tauren can only be druids in wow for balance reasons.  Lore wise they're night elf only.
---
And it only takes 5 minutes to do! The mission starts at the 21 minute mark, but the entire run is awesome.
---

---
The name reservation is limited to 3 per account. Once it goes live you get the usual.  
---
10 per server.  
---
50 in total over wow classic.
---
Don't get blacksmithing if you plan on playing a lot at Max level
---
Arcanite reapers on horde side should be quite profitable.
---
I’d be so fucking pissed to put so much time into a realm just for it to be the same one as asmongold. For the sake of everyone they need to plan it out ahead of time
---
Had similar times with my dad Vanilla-Wrath, this game blew my mind. I was ages 6-11 when I experienced pre-cata WoW. I had Playstation and Nintendo games that I really enjoyed but I had never seen a game on WoW's scale, it was the big kahuna of my game library.
---
People who you have to convince to play will probably not be people you want to play with in the first place.
---
Only rogues get wep skill from talents, with only a handful of items giving weapon skill that most aren't worth using.
---
The thibg with wep skill as well is that the first 5 points are worth 20% glance damage and 3% hit, with the last 3 being only worth 10% glancing, which mean orc and troll outdps human with their active racials, as you are basically forced to get the expertise talent anyway.
---
there are add-ons that are meant specifically for Classic, just put the folders containing them in the interface/addons folder wherever you have classic installed. curseforge has a drop down filter to show just the classic addons so you don't have to guess
---
But how could anybody forget about the pure gold known as [Life of an Ebayer](https://youtu.be/zkSNtClBVOo)
---
German
---
Yeah? Just no good at max? Which professions would you suggest for a warrior?
---
&gt;Better lore+zones? Completely objective. 
---
You mean subjective!
---
Yeah they really forced it in. Sargeras was supposed to be the "definitive, big, bad guy" but they forced a grey area on him. I'm a sucker for WoW lore so pretty much anything they feed me I'll consume but yeah, disapointing. Since "WoW" came out, the stories went downhill unfortunately. Even burning crusade I thought was pretty bad. Illidan's story arc is so frustrating. Regardless, I agree with you but I'm such a fanboy I'll eat it up anyways.

Any interest in weekend raiding? You seem to fit in very well with us other than raid times and I'd love to chat. If you think sat/sun 12-3pm raids send me a dm. Though keep in mind that is est.
---
Well, with the improved sap talent, you'll have a 90% chance of having that happen.  
---
Because without that talent, sap broke stealth.
---
Subreddit specific flair. Have to do it from a browser either on PC or mobile, don’t even think the official app supports it. It’ll be on the right side of the sub saying something like “set my flair as”

I'm talking about the attitude you are currently exhibiting. Pirate server players have spent years conditioning themselves to a broken, poorly done, emulation of a game. The beta they played is not a final build, and never got to top level. You can't get any real info from that.
---
Guilty
---
We should've just followed Ner'zhul damnit
---
I’m super looking forward to meeting noobs. I am a massive knowledge bank when it comes to Vanilla, so hell yeah I wanna help people and answer questions. Definitely going to join a guild full of people who never played Vanilla and (hopefully) raid with them through Naxx.
---
I played a Rogue so I could stealth to the end of dungeons, wait around for a group, then tag the boss as they pulled it. Then I would let them kill the boss for me. 
---
Had no idea how instances worked.
---
I'mma make a tauren feral druid and call him Rawr.
---
*NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO STEAL THIS*
---
I really want to see all those "stop pulling Korrak!" rants on bg chat.
---
Lol @ you hardos
---
There's not a ton of action here yet, but Blizzard posted a vanillafriends-ish set of threads trying to reconnect old pals, too. May as well give it a try: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/get-started-finding-people-here/215459
---
Sit back you smelly horde and let me tell you a story.
---
My father Yorf Dorf, was a proud and noble dwarven brewer.  He traveled down to the Black Morass, which is now known as the Blasted Lands to gather some very rare flowers for his award winning "Loch, Stock, and Two Smoking Gnomes" stout.  
---
While he was down there a giant portal opened.  
---
There was my father, minding his own business, as any good dwarf does and some smelly green creature that appeared to have been a cross between a Kodo's testicle and a Trogg's afterbirth came out of that portal. 
---
The creature cut him down and killed me Pa.  
---
Barely even needed to touch him either because he was the ugliest thing the world of Azeroth has ever seen, and that's saying a lot because we have Gnomes. 
---
I will never forget that day that the Horde, and more importantly the Orcs took Papa Yorf away from his son. 
---
Go back to the Outlands.  Feck yer sisters, eat yer poo, and build some more mudhuts.
---
You don't belong here!
---
Eh, that's kind of up to personal preference then.
---
I like the backflip they do when I kill them.
---
I mean not really. They eventually retconned him in WoD to be somewhat decent if I recall correctly. But in Warcraft I and II he's basically Blackhand's right hand man slaughtering humans around Stormwind and then kills Blackhand literally so that he can lead the genocide himself.
---
Frankly I was shocked in WC3 when Thrall decides to name his new city "Orgrimmar". 
---
(Now, with all that said, the humans of Lordaeron were on the whole pretty damn awful between the Second and Third War, so there's that.)
---
It's not that they're Alliance's problem. Rather like, only alliance stands its ground against it. Nefarian ? Stormwind troops. Onyxia ? Jaina's on it. Naxxramas ? Lordaeron's remaining is on it. Zul Gurub ? Alliance again. C'thun ? Elves it is. Are you horde savages to busy trying to clear ragefire ?
---
Puntable
---
Thanks for the advice, will follow it :)
---
I'll be playing all paladin specs. I'd say in dungeons I'll be playing prot &gt; ret &gt; heal by preference. And in raid I'll main manage to find a guild to main ret, and then heal as a backup when someone is absent or an additional healer is occasionally needed.
---
I'm gonna level as ret.
---
I think the biggest challenge as prot is to get decent gear to do dungeons comfortably. Paladin raid tier sets or even PvP sets are more than enough to tank any dungeon even if they don't have much tank stats, but trying to tank dungeon in mostly green or dps focused gear is not a good idea.
---
As I did in Vanilla, my plan is to be the friend that is available for any of the 3 roles for dungeons. Just be that easy going guildy, always there for dungeons of WPvP. I'm also looking forward gathering different gear pieces for all my 3 roles. I even MTed ZG several time back in the day, which was one of the best moments I've had in Vanilla.
---
When ganked? I simply kill the guy. Honestly when I was a noob and in full green I didn't want to WPvP, and then I just flee. But as soon as I got some decent dungeon and PvP gear, and even raid gear, I don't remember being successfully ganked by 1 guy. I just destroyed them with my reckoning spec.
---
As for the talents, I'll be rolling with a reckoning spec in which I have both consecration and seal of command, which effectively allows me to do dungeons in all 3 specs, and more importantly PvP decently. I'll only respec pure ret for raids, and stay raid specced when I'm broke.
---
Limpspring

Still better than handing out IBS to every freshly minted 51 for just sitting there through a 30 minute Zerg.
---
Hope yall enjoy it. Vegas crashed atleast 12 times trying to do this.
---
Not to mention that for the night elves, and especially for Cenarius, the woods are WAY more than just furniture.
---
Yes, blacksmithing is unfortunately not the best money maker without those great patterns.  However, there are still a decent amount of good items.  Twink gear, enchanter rods, sharpening stones, and then ofcourse, everything you gather from mining.  It will benefit you for leveling.  Honestly though, do what you want and you will still have fun :)
---
I’m one of them.
---
First Aid
---
I genuinely don't understand the hyper anti-streamer server attitude here. Half of the fun on the beta seemed to be them being able to create events for the community to come together and participate in out of thin air. Going to kill world bosses, Huge World PvP events, Dueling Tournaments, etc. Does community interaction like this not appeal to people? Isn't that half the point of Vanilla? You'll eventually tick off every other checkbox of leveling, farming mats, etc, if you occasionally get interrupted in exchange, I don't see the issue. You'll get interrupted all the time on a PvP server anyways..
---
Just another reason we could greatly use a RP-pvp server.  It certainly won't stop the toxicity but it will greatly cut down on that type of behavior where reputation means more than any other type of server.
---
Playing a least played class and getting instant invited.
---
I liked flying to the floating islands in Nagrand. Quite possibly my favorite place in wow.
---
I look forward to caring about my character. Character progression is going to be awesome!
---
Also it's against ToS to impersonate someone soooooo.....
---
ok i swear i thought it was just me  
---
their UI is the most convoluted like...i have no fucking idea what the fuck im looking at. replies to OP are posted under OP? or something? what the fuck are all these player avatar things under the OP. Literally who thought this was good
---
I would think Account doesn't refer to [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account but to WoW account. So assuming you mean 2 WoW accounts under your one B-net account, then I would guess that yes: 6 names across both WoW accounts.
---
Tinker
---
As a dwarf, I'd like to trade the gnomes to the Horde and get Taurens in return.  What say you Papa Cow?
---
I didn't know about extra action bars or addons, but found my way to the macro system. So armed with my printed-out list of hunter abilities I constructed an elaborate system of macros to enable the use of all abilities. It would automatically rotate hotbars depending on what I wanted to do.
---
This was even more pointless because despite the default 0-9 keybindings I still clicked all of those macros.
---
Yup! A great clarification.
---
People will struggle to outplay a good druid regardless of their class. Its the rarest and most unpredictable class, much less when played by someone worth a shit. They're good in BGs because there is always something to be done and plus druids are hard to pin down.
---
I never had a bank alt to mail stuff to.  I constantly ran my ass back to IF if SW several times a day just to vendor stuff and store things.
---
BS and Engineering are great for a warrior if you dont mind buying the mats or having an alt
---
Eh ? I was almost never blamed as a Healer and it was my main role for quite some time.
---
You shouldn't let people blame you when they made a mistake themselves. 
---
That does NOT mean you shouldn't try to improve with better cooldown management and your target priority but that comes with practice
---
Also, it makes me sound like an asshole but, if people want to act like jerk, I am a Healer, I can find another group. Yes yes, reputation is important but when if you are confident in your skill (good metrics for that is the amount of people asking you for run ), you should be fine.
---
It's also important to dissociate jerk from bad player. People can learn, even if they are slow. It's  your job as a Healer to save them, to give people a new chance to do the same mistake again and eventually, improve.
---
To answer the thread, Worst thing about being a Healer in vanilla ? Hunter... And their freaking Mana burn.
---
Trex here I come!
---
You can enjoy new stuff as well but man ... when and if I ever retire I am so playing Goldeneye again.
---
I remember first getting the Firestone spell on my lock and trying to melee, what a mess that was. (Didn’t it originally only add damage to melee attacks, or am I having a false memory here?)
---
Yea I think it’s fairly common for some serious streamers to use ones.
---
There is no honor in war. Only in battle.
---
In D&amp;D my girlfriend plays a gnome named Gnomalisa.
---
Your respecs are going to be 100g after you
---
Do it like 5 times or whatever. It’s very frustrating to raid as healing spec, have to repair and then have to spend 100g to respect so that you can more efficiently farm for raid prep.  Also, if you like to PvP and you want to Raid be prepared to make concessions with your spec unless you want to be pay for respecs all the time.
---
Yeah I think that's my plan.
---
There’s a difference in someone you have a relationship with  speaking to your face and randoms on the internet. There’s no relationship to ruin with internet folks, so there’s little-to-no holding back on input. Downside is that you may get some criticism that isn’t particularly constructive.
---
what class you playing?
---
Did you do this because the main thread defending right click reporting was by an lgbt person saying they need it to fight against trolling they received? 
---
FYI for those that haven't seen yes the main defence thread with Blizzard saying it will be in was someone saying they were trolled for asking for a lgbt friendly guild in Barrens on the beta.
---
Wolfshed helm is great for getting back into battle after needing to heal is what I noticed.
---
This man plays a rogue or hunter.
---
Speedbump
---
Right-click reporting is bad for left-handed.
---
I vote for Left-click reporting or neutral/middle-click reporting
---
Would you argue that it makes it feel worth it? Coming from FFXI where consumeables were really expensive and made such a huge difference in your character's output, consumeables were extremely worth it there.
---
I never raided in WoW but if it only makes a small difference, I would agree with you.
---
Can you link me the source to this...
---
Yeah I am not the best at photo shop I use to stream a lot and never did much editing but starting to learn more everyday
---
I think some people don't actually know. It's not advertised at all so if you used to play wow but quit completely (meaning you don't read reddit or follow any wow youtubers) it's definitely possible not to know. I even bet there are some % of people that play other blizzard games regularly that don't know. 
---
It's just to people us it seems like everyone "should" know because we frequent all the right places and it's such a big deal to us
---
Been available in the EU for a few days already.
---
As I ride on my bike at the end of Dark Knight, there’s a few plot points that just don’t feel right...
---
👍🏻
---
Do you intend to play classic or are you just going to continue to curate all of our bullshit as a hobby?
---
Probably a Pally actually.  And they can bind a key to /say I can do this all day.
---
Truest thing I’ve read all day
---
Wait, are you talking about Prestor or Clinton?
---
Even if just one poor new player does this im predicting it will happen (probably an alliance player)
---
This is a serious problem. You’ve never been standing in orgrinmar minding your business and a troll just ran up all jank tusked and called you a fat cow. I might be a Tauren but I have feelings too.
---
I agree that hunter is not so bad, I actually enjoy the class. 
---
I just meant compared to locks, hunters have more of that kind of thing to deal with. 
---
So it seemed odd that someone who would refuse to play warlock because of a silly thing like shards would then turn to hunter as the solution, lol.
---
It should be common courtesy, you shouldn't have to "invoke spoilers". If it isn't relevant to the topic (which it wasn't in OP's post) then there's no reason to spoil anything, regardless of how old it is.
---
50g cap on respecs
---
#**HOLY SHIT YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND???????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
---
Correct. It was Onyxia that single-handedly weakened Stormwind almost to the point of collapse.
---
That’s wherw WoW starts actually.
---
You deserve C****r.
---
It's not a phase, mom!
---
I'm not forcing anything on anyone?
---
- Don't be racist!
---

---
- Druids!  Feral Druids!!
---
Found a radio edit and added it in :)

Love the toxicity that already exists in this community.

I really doubt it, theyd be delaying all their followers from playing wow at all then until they announce it.

Not a mechanic but I had issues with many of the abbreviations starting out.
---
Switched my main over to a Gnome Mage thinking I would be very popular with all the Looking For Gnome &amp; Looking For Mage chats going around. Not sure when I figured out what LFG / LFM stood for, but it definitely took longer than it should have.
---
Damn, feels good getting that off my chest after all these years.
---
That’s because they allied the wrong trolls! It should’ve been the Amani! Zul’jin for life!
---
Still praying for a surprise RP-pvp realm! \*fingers crossed\* 
---
If not hopefully we get this info asap so the community can figure out what pvp server to take over
---
Must be a shaman, shhhhhhhhhh
---
I would not argue that. I have never played FFXI but, classic wow already takes a dick shit ton of time. It takes about 8 hours a week to farm the consumables you need to raid naxx. Keep in mind as well. Thats what you need to raid Naxx successfully. If you wipe a lot learning the instance it's gonna cost way more. 
---
Like I said though I can't compare it to whats acceptable in FFXI because I haven't played it. I just know needing to spend 8+ hours a week just to raid is insane. Considering most guilds that aren't turbo imba players are prolly gonna spend 12+ hours a week clearing it.

**Raid Times:**     As most of us wish to keep raiding on retail in our hardcore guilds   we   will raid different days from the norm to accommodate this.     Friday/Tuesday CET - 20:00-00:00 (We may add a Saturday night during the     first 1 or 2 weeks of progress if there is enough interest)
---
**Loot Rules:** We will most likely use EPGP loot distribution with additional priority for important roles such as Main Tank etc.
---
**Recruitment:**     We are currently looking for any players who wish to experience all     content that Vanilla WoW has to offer at a more relaxed pace to allow     IRL time or time for other games. Socials are also welcome to join  our    community and have fun in dungeons, pvp and other games with us.
---
**CURRENTLY RECRUITING**
---
You can check out our current roster and recruitment needs here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VU6gIWk4iDepdJSIhJN-mfM5xGeQTtyslFkP9e2vwvU/edit#gid=861069355](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VU6gIWk4iDepdJSIhJN-mfM5xGeQTtyslFkP9e2vwvU/edit#gid=861069355)

**DON'T     BE DETERRED IF YOUR CLASS IS NOT LISTED HERE, WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE     LOOKOUT FOR EXCEPTIONAL PLAYERS AND SOME MAY EVEN BE WILLING TO REROLL     TO ALLOW YOU TO PLAY WHAT YOU WANT**
---
We     do not care if you are a veteran at Classic wow or if this would be     your first time, we simply ask that you are serious about playing in     Classic WoW and our community.
---
**What we expect from you:**
---
**Communication.**     You must must be able to communicate effectively in English in game    and  over voice com. You must therefore have a decent    microphone/headset. We  use Discord as our VOIP.
---
**Dedication.**     We don’t have any insane crazy requirements, we simply ask that you     prepare the basics for your character including consumables and   enchants
---
**Attitude**.     If you are a total asshole, then this probably isn’t the place for    you,  we aim to continue and extend our current atmosphere and    friendship  group.
---
**Attendance.** Near 100% attendance should be mandatory for all raiders especially since we will only be raiding 2 days.
---
**Connection**.     We expect that you will have a reliable internet connection, we know     this is vanilla but that doesn’t mean you should be playing on a  dial  up   connection from 2004! :P
---
A home and community which you are encouraged to be a part of both outside and inside of raids.
---
A well formed community between players allowing for you to find something to do even on empty days of the week.
---
A new group of friends to interact and play games with.
---
Progress at a steady, constant pace.

I've been actively recruiting people for a Alliance US-west PVP guild for 2 months now, if you actively are getting "dope" server, We are interested
---
60 levels is a much different experience than 10, and getting to do it in a living world. I can't imagine a new player right now leveling from 1 to 120. It would be so lonely.
---
The problem with that is that certain classes (hybrids mainly) were penalized the most by respeccing costs. 
---
Druids, for example, can tank, heal or dps reasonably well if they spec into it. However, even if they specced into it, they were never better than their "pure class" counterpart. 
---
So being "locked" by way of gold price to a spec that is still inferior, even if you can spec to three main roles, feels bad. 
---
Now if those hybrid specs were also on par with "pure classes" then it would be OK, but vanilla didn't offer that.
---
I don't think I understand. The functionality in the API is there because they want you to use it. They didn't know in advance *how* you would use it, but they did mean for you to. It was designed with the intention that players would take extensive advantage of it.
---
When use cases arose that went beyond what the developers intended for you to do, those portions of the API were restricted.

Technically the Orcs were tresspassing and cutting down trees... Then the Nightelves were like heeeellll no
---
They're not second to anyone. Shaman are at the end because they're exclusive to Horde.
---
Shadow as neutral levelling seems pretty harsh. It's a very strong levelling spec really, definitely in the top half of specs in the game. High kill speed and sustain, just no movement spells lets it down. Putting it on the same level as disc and holy doesn't seem right.
---
Exactly! The RPG element is completely non existent in retail anymore

By that time we were all Swe, we had a few Nor/Dan/Fin. I'm the GM of the guild (small spoon). We were an admin gang from an old Counter-Strike site that made an guild (we had 85000 users playing CS). Sometime early 2006 after a year of raiding somone said we need to meet. I asked my parents if I could have an small gathering of gaming buddies over for an BBQ. They allowed it (I was a non drinker at the age of 20, so this is 13 days after my 20th birthday). We were 50 people over 48 hours that met and BBQed, we have done it for the last 15 years.

---
Class : Rogue (myself) Warlock(friend)
---
Raid times preferred:  Weeknights/sunday as early as 7pm EST to as late as midnight EST. Would prefer to raid 2-3 nights. 
---
Looking for: Semi-hardcore raiding guild, no real preference on loot style as long as it is not simple rolls.  Looking for a guild that plans to help each other get to 60 and start raiding fairly early. 
---
About us : Both Canadian, late 20s to mid 30s. We both have jobs, but play alot of video games. Currently do not play retail wow, but we both raiders  back in classic, have played every expansion together. I am a long time alliance rogue player while my friend will be a first time alliance player. Both very serious about raiding but can't commit the time to be in a hardcore raiding guild.  We both also enjoy pvp and alts, both have working mics and enjoy hanging out in discord. He plays alot of PoE while waiting for classic while i am doing more netflix things at the moment. 
---
We are looking to see what is out there for guilds we may be interested in. 
---
Thanks for reading.
---
21 points in Enhancement buys you more than Flurry and crit, though. It also buys you a pretty significant buff to blocking (more important in PvP than PvE), near-instant-cast Ghost Wolf, Guardian Totems (those totem buffs are huge in PvE and PvP), and 5% parry. On my last Shaman, I stopped at 21 points in Enhancement and put my next 19 points into Resto before filling out Enhancement, and it felt like the ideal way to level a Shaman.
---
they decided to skip vanilla, classic starts at cataclysm
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, it's not dead and it certainly survived 24 hours
---
haha, Hrafnin FLygur? Mortifiera? Hollow Grin? :D

Stratholme Live till my eyes bleed. I will dominate the phase 1 orb market.

I got a LOT of mixed results trying to research priest leveling in general. Shadow definetly is the best of the three priest leveling specs, but the rankings are compared to ALL other classes, and it didnt feel right putting it up there with mage hunter or warlock.
---
Interestingly i haven't seen anything solid about the trick where you could keep your demon alive and still get the DS buff. It was used by md/ruin warlocks.
---
Some here have claimed it wasn't in the game very long but I seem to recall it lasting quite awhile. Honestly I can't recall when it was finally patched out. 
---
I remember for a period of time on the official forums it was a known "bug". I say "bug" because I remember one of the blues named Tseric saying basically it wasn't really an exploit and more of a clever use of mechanics. It should be noted however that Tseric was known to play...... An MD/Ruin warlock.
---
The only information we have on that is "What the community desires"
---
Which scares the hell out of me. According to Blizzard that's how wer got to BFA as well.

It's a reference to Roleplay the movie, best movie ever!
---
Unless you're running with the same crew that are intentionally letting you gather all the pieces it could take a long long time. Once you have the ring though people will usually pay 10g just for you to open the door for them, so it's a long term investment.
---
Hunter
---
&gt;he has every single totem bound to an individual button instead of using a totem management addon
---
While Priests are the strongest overall healers, and probably the most versatile, I'm pretty sure Paladins have them beat on raw healing power.
---
Try and keep politics out of this.  Orcs drinking demon blood is not in any way a cultural thing.  They were pawns of Kil'jaeden and did not do anything like that prior to Ner'zhul being tricked into an alliance with the Burning Legion.  And even then, he tried to back out of it before being betrayed by Gul'dan.  You shouldn't draw sweeping conclusions about an entire culture by looking at a single opportunistic sociopath.

Imma go aay hi to stormwind wit muh homiez &gt;;)
---
Which race though? I kinda picture "thex" as a troll name for some reason?
---
We don't know.
---
A likely outcome is that they progress some servers to TBC, but only let people migrate characters off a realm.
---
The realms will stay intact and be Vanilla forever.
---
Because when they come to WotLK or some other undefined expansion, people will start complaining "bring back Vanilla".
---
Here's hoping.  It does kind of make it sound like they may slip one in there.  Maybe I'm just being too hopeful.
---
I like Teci and Temble, I don't plan rolling any Gnomes on Classic so I don't mind sharing them.
---
Tyrannosaurus Thex?
---
yah I quit during the lich king and kind of just heard about how everything went down hill from there anyways. I’ve seen a few videos on recent expansions and they don’t even look like the same game I remember playing.
---
It shouldn't scare you.  There's no reason they can't launch new Classic servers once a year (or whatever) even if they've moved on to other expansions / content.
---
&gt; I wonder if it would be better with Paladin and Shaman all the way at each end, because they're the ones that are unique to alliance and Horde.
---
There is no information on this. The community also seems very split in wanting Classic+, BC, or nothing.
---
I'm a Classic+ man myself.

I always thought it was odd that hunters used mana.

Yes. Evil old god magic. Their king tried to kill Troggs and inadvertently killed 80% of his own people. Although... Was it an accident? Or was he purging gnomekind!

---
Well you already put enhancement as 'good' levelling. Shadow is going to be a lot faster than enhancement 40+. Of course people will always argue with whatever you put down.  
---
I mean for warrior I notice you put all as bad which seems pretty harsh to me as well. I would much rather level as an arms or fury warrior than a disc priest.
---
Charge in Classic acts more like the retail version. It doesn't feel like vanilla's charge at all.
---
A few did; usually only one per raid.  It was a DPS loss, since you lost DS, like you said. But you got back some of the lost DPS by being able to pick up Shadow Mastery, as well as being allowed to apply corruption and get instant Shadowbolts.  DS/Ruin was still better for DPS, but mostly people just wanted Blood Pact on the tanks.
---
It wasn't a mainstream build by any means, but it was popular enough that I wanted to mention it.  Just like SM/Ruin, you could easily PVP with the build too, which probably helped it's popularity.
---
This one is fine, by the way. I just thought I'd give some feedback.
---
Make sure to get dartols rod
---
Hey, shadow isn't *that* bad for raiding. Top of the meters? Hell no, but they can easily be mid-tier. Neutral would have been more fair.
---
It's naive to think either side is better than the other, in general, and if you do believe that you're just as much a part of the issue as those you're calling out. Each side has good people and bad people.
---
Btw Thaurissan summoned rag , resulting in the DI dwarves essentially  becoming rags own little personal army.
---
You also left out the fact that night elves were the first ones to meddle with the well of eternity and fuck with magic, attracting Sargeras and the burning legion to azeroth (and , therefore, Nerzhul aka the lich King as well, being deceived by Kiljaeden  -- a top officer for Sargeras )
---
If we are gonna point fingers at anyone for azeroths biggest overall shitshow it's definitely night elves .
---
I'd rather just see more Tier 3 sets.
---
Same, I'm in my 30's and friends who havent even touched any game in 5+ years are getting hyped for classic. Most didnt know about it before I told them though
---
I actually pray for this.
---
I'm not much of an EQ player,  but I think it's awesome they literally just launched legacy servers for their 20 year anniversary.  Been playing that,  I'm not an EQ player,  so I don't really like the game,  but playing it is super cool and learning with vets. 
---
I certainly hope new servers in the years ahead are something they will consider
---
Nobody sat down and was like "okay guys here's this new word you have to use". Languages evolve. People start using different terms for things. You can either adopt the newer language or stubbornly stick to what you're used to. People will understand what you mean either way.
---
I believe it's 8:00am Tuesday 13th AEST for any lazy Aussies out there :)
---
Awesome, thanks.  2006 feels like a lifetime ago.
---
Interesting! i always heard priest edged em out barely, but paladin was particularly good for burst heals. Paladin will certainly get recognized as being a powerhouse of a healer, don't worry there!
---
One of those names is not like the others

BoP dumps threat? I thought it only temporarily removed them from the threat table, fully restoring threat after the BoP cancels?
---
This is the least funny joke ever
---
You did pick a flair though! Warrior at least lets you tank, so there's that.
---
Thank you. There was a huge TIFU up post a month ago about a guy snipping his balls while trying to shave for his significant other. Turns out the whole post was an add for Manscape razors, but the vast majority of upvoters didn’t know or care. I would hate to see this subreddit end up the same way
---
I was also liking troll for berserking since that will be 60% total haste with flurry up.  Though I don't know what the threshold is for the 30%.  Why do you suggest Tauren?
---
Another thing that helps is the tank can't just quit your group and instantly re-queue and be in a new one in Classic. It takes time to form a party and make your way to the instance so unless you have somebody that's constantly wiping your group it's easier to just corpse run and try again than to start all over.
---
Happy to be of assistance; and if you ever need some clarification on anything, feel free to ask!

You mean by putting the genocidal incurably demon blood infused semi-beasts that invaded their world and destroyed half the continent into camps, instead of killing them off? How cruel.

I have a n52te in the closet.  I dug out my  Steel Series Merc Stealth for classic. I’ll miss my mechanical for some stuff but otherwise best mmo keyboard IMHO. They aren’t made anymore so they are salty AF to buy now days.

Also I bet they sound super sexy. We had a girl in our guild EVERYONE went completely gah gah for, I mean this girls voice could melt butter and dudes were jumping over each other to help her with mats and questing and shit just to hear her little lilting giggle. Years later during the near end of TBC my buddy goes, hey man do you remember Khal**** and I'm like fuck yeah I do! Too bad she transferred server why? Hes like check out this link she invited to be a Facebook Friend!...

It only takes like 45min to do all the running involved. Unless you're going for server first 60 I'd say get the form. 
---
Also, a hunter is 100% going to beat you to server first 60.
---
Having played Priest a lot in vanilla I agree with all your ratings bruhh.
---
Sort of in the same boat with a few heavy favorites.  My choices in today's current order of how im feeling... warlock, shaman, warrior, mage, rogue or priest... I look at this as a 33% win so far... hunter druid and pally are out for sure... for today.  Maybe writing out my reasons will help me form my decision and maybe help you also... or not. 
---
Breaking them down with some of my thoughts on selecting each class... from the perspective of not having played wow for about a decade.
---
Warlock:
---
I keep coming back to the lock but everyday is a fight to keep this one up top.  Don't have a lot of experience with the class, I had a 39 lock twink back in the day that I eventually leveled to 70 but never really did any meaningful raiding on.  A lot of this decision is due to high solo ability and also pvp as a lock I loved.  As my first character could farm gold easy, fun world pvp with fun class mechanics as well as mount quests.  Downside is raids, debuff limit, hardest to hit cap will make some times frustrating but worth it in the end in my mind after fighting to get a dps spot.
---
Shaman:
---
I did no raiding in vanilla and instead went hardcore as bc came out.  Mained a draenei resto shaman, was in one of the top golds on our alliance side.  My guild got stuck on muru in sunwell and I think this was close to wrath coming out so didn't spend a lot of weeks trying him.  Healing is like a love hate for me.  I love healing a crazy hard raid as you feel amazing when you keep a tank up through some enrage or other crazy healing moments like an aggro swap where you somehow save a squishie from... getting squished.  You felt like the backbone that held the raid up.  I didn't like that healing was all I was wanted for, in bc with dual spec I'd get jealous that other classes would switch sets and spec and play a different role, also getting priority to loot that would essentially be for an off spec.  I want allowed to off spec so extra gear would only be for pvp purposes and deemed less necessary.  No problem I'll just keep saving your raid topping healing and watch other people get cool shit.  Best for the raid so you just gotta suck it up... it is what it do.  Pvp wise not my favorite but had a ton of tricks to play with.  Close second to warlock right now as I love leveling enhance and I really do enjoy healing...a lot. 
---
Warrior:
---
I really want to talk myself into this one.  I have limited tanking experience.  I rolled a dk in wrath.  Tanked heroics and naxx rerelease ulduar I don't remember much, this is close to when I stopped playing.  Was it ulduar with the 10 man hard mode or whatever? I remember trying to get a 2haxe there... anyways... tanking I had a lot of fun also.  I like to do a job and do it well and the tank was the easiest way to get respected as a class.  Be good at your job and people will know your name.  Preamble aside I'd like to try with the penultimate warrior tank.  Leveling will be a pain but fine, being broke with repairs no fun.  I would probably just level in dungeons so not a big deal.  The problem I have with this that is kind of a deal breaker might be my available raid hours.  I see plenty of guilds looking for players during my work hours... all of the ones listed right now in fact.  Not one graveyard guild out there.  This is the biggest downside for me right now.  I have a lot of time to play, that time just starts at 1030pm pdt and this is when about every guild on the list is getting done raiding.  From that time on I have 8 hours at least free or more if I sleep a little less but demand is looking low for those hours so competition with other tank would be high if late night raiders do pop up.  Maybe?

That's plenty of a novel for now so I'll just eliminate the mage and rogue section.  Will most likely be one of those top 3 and that is a small enough number to select my 3 names.  You did help me OP! 
---
All that being said if any late night raiders looking for filler.... going to be a tank, healer or dps for my 3 choices there...horde pvp NA.  All 3 will get leveled eventually.  Hope any of my insights help with your decision OP, mainly was just thinking out loud for my own benefit.

I've heard that it can be quite handy to use the thumb directionals for movement, leaving easier to reach keys for keybinding instead of movement.  
---
That being said I have an Ergodox-EZ, which is kinda like a gamepad in some ways. There is a semi-decent learning curve, and I haven't really played much wow with it yet to be honest.

Yes. I too use my keyboard for totem binds.
---
sometimes mechanics like that can be confusing, to be fair. Like in Path of Exile, there's a HUGE difference between "increased" damage/critchance/shootypower and "more" damage/critchance/shootypower

Unfortunately, yes.

Been using a Logitech G13 Gamepad for years. Would like to change, but I am so used to the G13 I imagine it would be difficult.

**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. Currently we are primarily recruiting for the Saturday team which is fairly open to most classes/roles. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule.
