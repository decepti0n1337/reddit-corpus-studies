True, 103 is bigger than 100, I guess it depends what are the trinkets you are deciding to ignore to have that 103 slotted.
---
Dude you have different items for riding that you swap out. I‚Äôm always catching other epic riding 60s when I wear gloves/boots/trinket. The difference is big.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone understands the fuck you‚Äôre trying to say in your first comment
---
Could be on a laptop with mobile internet
---
Is there no Winter Veil in this update? Did I stockpiled all those small eggs for nothing!?!?
---
you're a moron lmao
---

---
&gt;It's called old school runescape, obviously they're not going to make any changes to it. What is "old school" about new stuff?
---
imagine being this dense
---
Silly druids
---
Nostalrius died for this joke version of AV. 
---
Add mines and buff the NPCs
---
Are you able to find any for sale? They are always out of stock when I search.
---
So it's basically like the "Classic AV event" in Retail? Haven't been online yet.
---
I love these cinematics, it makes your character seem like a huge hero in the Warcraft universe. We should get our own garrisons or something.
---
Horde PSA: cap snowfall gy
---
I remember it like this in later vanilla, not sub 10 minutes but fast matches were common and people would complain and get mad if too many were fighting in the middle of the map and wasting time.
---
None of my addons broke. I just loaded them even though they show as outdated.
---
Was the case for americans so yes it will be that duration.
---
This joke version of Av is no changes .
---
Npc were stronger back then and there was more of them. It was harder to rush through.
---
Yes! I'm winning on it!
---
Probably eye of shadow in the demon area in winter spring. You might have to do some kiting etc. 
---
Depends what it sells for obviously. On my server it's about 250 gold ish. Usually get 1 an hour if you're kill speed is good. Split the gold. If you get two then each take 1 to sell.
---
I don't believe you.
---
Yeah a lot of these comments are fucking mindblowing.
---
&gt; if I don't hang out with her for 6 hours then it's neglect
---
lol
---
So my addons are down after the update today. 
---
In particular, tsm and questie. What do I do to get them live? Should I go back to twitch and re-download them? Or will they fix by themselves?
---
This is what I wanted and was my reason for joining. I'm actually quitting over this, I feel ripped off.
---
&gt; This is why people fought for the old version for so long
---
If anything, if there were BGs in a pre-honor enviroment, people'd go slug it out in the BGs for hours probably.
---
In a post-honor enviroment, and with the carrot of R14, and all the elite PvP gear in it's post-buffed state. and the gear being great for some classes.. Honor/hour is best, WSG queues are longer because less honor/hour.
---
Lol guess I was right in thinking that I shouldn't bother with BG's on classic if I care about actually having fun. 
---
Maybe on an AV weekend.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm horde on that server and now reroll on Venoxis Alliance. It‚Äôs going towards 35/65 A/H, which is very unbalanced already.. sad days
---
Horde won? Fake News. ^(/s)
---
I love census. Our alli side is very active and has good data, our (my) horde side is lacking l, so I started being the census person. Has been quite interesting seeing the balance even out as time has gone on. 
---
For ref it's a pve server, alli heavy, but the gap has closed a lot since the early days
---
because its an AI you fucking idiot
---
Its no pvp its pve only and borring af... hope they release the other version
---
I think he‚Äôs lying too...
---
I don‚Äôt play retail. But vanilla this version of AV is fast if people rush the end bosses. Npcs don‚Äôt hit very hard. It‚Äôs easier than earlier versions of AV which has npcs who hit like elite dungeon mobs.

---
the only thing annoying me is the people who give up if the game goes past 7 minutes. Like if its too slow for you just take the deserter. Its annoying having like half the group freak out at people still trying in a winnable bg
---
Because you can play a niche build with niche weapons and items that just work in the lower brackets.
---
Hence why I want to be worth as little as possible! Probably less of an issue with battlegrounds now. Hopefully folks will just be trapped in AV forever and I can actually farm and quest.
---
Yep, just as I said, full riding set, not a fighting set. You do you, I'd prefer to use fighting gear fighting, which serves better than my ride enchants.
---
This so borring and 0 fun
---
Untrue no changed is version 1.10
---
i'm the same i quit wow when my guild finished raiding until 8.3 for the content (were just too small for mythic consistent 15-18 and can never get the extra peepso that are willing to sit out if theres more than enough) resubbed for classic and now im gearing up a 120 shaman while playing a shaman on classic
---
i gotta say having classic for when i just want to relax and goof off in pvp and MC and having retail for my serious PvE M+ or raiding has made me enjoy both so much more
---
no changes wanted the earlier version...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
stop repeating this
---
I would have preferred 1.11 AV
---
Av is pve only and will be the meta... better quit the game already
---
I would gladly let everyone know I‚Äôm a fucktard if it meant half the people here could smell their own shit lmao.
---
You sir, are a lifesaver. Much appreciated.
---
oh shit this ain't that I've supposed
---
ah yes, its the alliance's fault...
---
Yeah well also depends on the class you play, as a mage I can always reset combat once I caught them, swap back and start the fight.
---
I'm now at 16 games with 2 wins, i'm movin on up in the world!
---
yawn.
---
we are playing 1.12 Vanilla. That's what AV looked like in that patch. 1000s of things minor and major are NOT the same as on WoW launch in 1.12 patch both now and in 2016. just stop this nonsense
---
Why do you think you get a level boost for modern wow for hitting 60 in classic?
---
Anyone actually in that situation isn't gunna be sitting on their ass playing games.
---
Can you recommend one?

That‚Äôs mean. Huntards are the classic version of Huntards. #nochanges
---
Av is pve only and 0 fun. Unluckily its the fastest honor per hour
---
Yep, a ton of pvp on LB back in the day.
---
Think you can just click 'update' for your addons on Twitch mod page.
---
640g
---
It is not at all like AV back in the day.  You were either drunk, high, or in elementary school if this is how you remember it.  
---
/yawn
---
I just got back from the gym.  I was hoping that while I was gone someone would come up with a solution, but it seems like noone has.  A method GetTotemInfo has been removed from the public API, which has been causing a lot of totem related macros and addons to no longer work.  It's unclear at this point if it was an intended change or not.  Ninja change for sure though.
---
Biggles needs more ally‚Äôs. not a terrible end game balance of 59% horde to 41% ally
---
Did you know there were multiple iterations of AV, so if you remember a different version you aren't necessarily wrong?
---
What a concept.
---
Yeah you most likely only need 3-5 people to take towers back, because lol sometimes not even one person does defend the flags, most of the times it‚Äôs just 2 peeps.
---
Kind of defeats the whole purpose of AV imo. I wonder if people would be upset if they patched so you'd have to actually capture towers or the graveyard before you can confront him.
---
they're not even 10 minutes now, most of mine are 6 at the moment.
---
Yes 100% agree. Its zero pvp but pve only. Its terrible. Its borring. Unluckily its the fastest honor per hour
---
I just hit level 46 ! still going strong with shit loads to get done.
---
Speaking from experience though

I‚Äôm about to black out.

"Sorry guys gtg, my dog just came out of the closet"
---
I think you might have missed the joke. The image isn't a cinematic and these features are in retail.
---
i came here with the same problem, and this fixed it for me. THanks!
---
I would have worked on bettering myself in real life and focusing on real goals instead of my warrior character goals.
---
If your goal is to get as most honour as fast as possible then yeah this is normal. AV is both teams running past each other to get to the final guy. It's a pve race if you're going for the best honour per hour.
---
Hey, remember this comment. Lol
---
This is the real AV experience as long as honor exists in any form. (for rank, or currency to buy gear as in  BC+)
---
This. I logged on my old twink today and the lvl 19 had 1.2k health, lol.
---
You can use an add-on to automatically switch into your riding gear on mount and back on dismount. It's what I do to get the best of both worlds
---
It probably re-uses a lot of the data from retail.
---
Yeah well since you guys keep adding variables like enchants (which I had already adressed) and now the class, ofc, I can also fit my narrative if I keep moving the goal posts.
---
I just said carrot alone made no noticeable difference on epic mount, which is true. You stop moving for one second that the other mount didn't and the 3% speed is basically null.
---
R14 grind would be fun with wsg premades beeing meta.. but this av is meta and 0 fun, 0 pvp. Pve only
---
Cap IB

Once you get the hang of it, you realize that tribute runs become increasingly easier and very consistent. It allows for more wiggle room than you‚Äôd assume at first glance.
---
Disclaimer: I haven‚Äôt done Maraudon farming.
---
you want a druid and a warlock for their armor debuffs. they'll provide more damage than an extra 2 fury warriors, or a fury warrior and a priest since the druid is probably a healer. the amount of healers is variable depending on the encounter needs, so. also, one priest should be 31/0/20 and the rest should be 31/20/0 to maximize the lone warlock's damage for free, since even a 31/0/20 priest heals just fine.
---
So far, it seems to favor premade vs premade.
---
Even then, a good premade group steamrolls any pug group, voice won‚Äôt help there.
---
This one is good
---
Honor is a ladder
---
He sits around mid for about 10 minutes, then proceeds to path all the way to the alliance base. We were turtling back and forth for awhile until Lok *stomped* the alliance to their base. Within a few minutes of him patrolling forward, we killed Vanndar no problem.
---
I wish I could say it was a great victory, but having to listen to "Let the alliance win!" "This isn't fast enough honor" "Lolnice RP nerds" was very disheartening. I'm glad I was battleground leader and could make this happen, but I don't think I'll be participating in much AV from now on. At least I got this little nostalgia trip!

Is it just me or wasn't he a lot taller in the past?

I have to put the cat out.

Response: Why is it burning?
---
Why are you taking shadow priests to pve
---
That seems counterproductive
---
I don‚Äôt care about that. I‚Äôm just stating that this AV is accurate to the vanilla experience and can be considered no changes
---
One of my guildies swear they had a 6 minute run. I was low key impressed. I didn‚Äôt know you could even run to the boss that fast.
---
epic battles, aka mages aoing and you dying as a melee after getting one kill and walking back. I fell asleep when p2 was released and I sat doing nothing during these epic battles as a melee... 
---
I really dont understand why and how you people glorify this. I would much rather play WSG for the pvp aspect where you have smaller fights and where you can personally outplay the enemy.
---
The categories drop down. Horrific. It's not even alphabetized.
---
I swear he used to be huge.
---
He grows in size with every Alliance he kills. Unfortunately, I didn't get any more pictures due to trying to lead everyone into defending our base while Lok'holar pushed forward.

The neutered AV is an absolute godsend.  I was dreading the exalted grind on two characters but I should be able to get it done in less than a week at this rate.  I'm so fucking happy that it's possible to get 6-7 minute wins without even being in a premade.

That‚Äôs what it was lol. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Sort of everyone messed up.  Priest should have used SS but maybe they were knew or didn‚Äôt even knew they had it and reflex clicked release.
---
If I run back and someone didn‚Äôt and they weren‚Äôt specifically being a shit all run I would drink and rez them.  Mana is an infinite resource so he was just being a dick, or sour you chose not to run back with everyone.
---
In the future though, assume its your job to run back with the rest of the group.  Its annoying when people act like that is time to afk or do whatever while the healer is forced to run back and rez one or all the group, we barely get any time to drink in game let alone get 5 mins to chill out in a dungeon.
---
It actually isn't. At all. In fact it says right in the rule. If the base image isn't World of Warcraft Classic then it's removed. If it isn't removed it's because it hasn't been reported and we have not seen it yet.
---
No you stockpiled them for Winter Veil
---
You will get better survivability from the damage options elemental provides rather than speccing into defensive talents in the enhancement tree. A dead player does no damage, and ele resto also includes the burst to take out key targets. You can wear a shield regardless of spec, so you are somewhat tanky anyhow. 5-10% more block chance (with bad str) and 5% parry won't be worth the heavy investment into enhancement considering the other options available.
---
It's a nifty idea and you can make it work, but you will probably enjoy the other PvP specs more.
---
any good stuff for mages?
---
Ok so its easier for alliance to enter base...then why dont Horde defend??
---
"My cat pulled out my Internet cable and I didn't realise"
---
queues are very long but i can't say i'm surprised
---
I love the classic community, but not the game. Hate the retail community but love the game. So I just hang around this subreddit while playing retail, works for me!
---
30 seconds - yet for two months alliance claimed all horde would have game-breaking queues HA
---
Hey maybe. I'm making my own fun though I never made it far in pvp progression this time around I just might!
---
Happened to me Playing in AV. Have to log out and in to clear it.
---
Seriously. Some people just like to say some funny/weird shit before they log off.
---
It got changed a free expansions ago. Its still around but it shares a cooldown now. It's not been op for awhile.
---
Lol, i guess the answer will be nostalrius was betterü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Why the second /cast auto shot
---
I can't wait to grind out the Frostwolf Howler!!
---
You are in a raid group so you get the honor for every kill divided equally among the raid group.
---
Go back to retail boomer
---
This is a freaking joke.  Farm PVE to get top PVP rank.
---
I don't care if every rotation has like 6 buttons and a proc and a cooldown now or whatever, the removal of talents and general class identity is horrible
---
I spent like 20 minutes in the stormwind portal ballroom trying to figure out if I could get to darnassus.
---
There aren‚Äôt considerable queues at all.  I have 30 seconds at most.
---
I wouldn't, it's pretty annoying how some of the BIS pve gear is in AV. Thankfully these quick battles mean I can get my gear then never BG again
---
Any BiS List that merely puts in 1 item and doesn't consider stat weights is unoptimized and thus not "BiS".
---
If you have Hit from other items, truestrike becomes worth a lot less and you can wear Black Dragonscale items as a warrior dps for example. 
---
If you're tanking or healing, things get even more "feelcrafty". Do you *need* to dish out more threat, or can your DPS go nuts from the first second on every boss already? Do you really need the MP5 from this item more than a Shaman who is totem twisting when you're playing a priest, and bosses in *your* raid die in 30sec to 1.5 min? Probably not desperately.
---
Loot should not be distributed because it's "BiS" but because you actually need it to further strengthen your raid. How you allocate DKP based on that's up to you - if you're even using DKP.
---
F
---
And a 5-cap victory? Or was that added later?
---
So I couldn't queue with my friend at all. WSG had the queue as group option but not AV, is this intended?
---
You didn‚Äôt scroll down before you decided to post this, did you? 
---
AV is the hot new thing to whinge about!
---
This is why emotes are always enough Good thing Blizzard banned then and win traders
---
for the record, I am pro-rep farming and am excited for my ring
---
Twink games tend to be more competitive than the majority of level 60 BGs simply because the people playing in the BGs are there to PvP because they want to play the game and not because they are grinding honour. They have none of the bullshit that comes with honour farming such as dodging, afking, people not even trying etc. A lot of the time they are genuinely more interesting than a level 60 match.  
---
Level 60 games tend to be more one sided i.e full premade vs pugs, and people can still be totally out geared just like a twink vs non twink. 
---
You can create your character(s) and then just play the game, without needing to raid/farm/update the char every patch. The only upkeep is consumeables.
---
pls no defend
---
Yo shoutout to the #nochanges crowd for this atrocious incarnation of AV
---
Farming pve to get top pvp rank? something is not right here.
---
I could very well be remembering it with a nostalgic twinge. I played as a rogue in vanilla, for what it's worth.
---
Lol
---
&gt;I know this is satire, but I'm going to get on my high horse anyway and give random people relationship advice on a video game forum
---
Eh I was right I have a 30 second queue feelsgoodman
---
My cursor exploded in size. Anyone else have that issue?
---
No, I broke the dam
---
I mean, to be fair they are unlikely to cost mana for enh or ele, since neither of those classes use mana for anything but heals and mana management for resto is not nearly as big a deal in retail. Also, chances are they will have a WotLK style system where you can cast 4 in a single global, kind of like a "Move all active totems to me" thing.
---
stupid blizzard! this is worse than not having battlegrounds!
---
no?
---
So run the census yourself if no one else is uploading data.
---
And anyways whats so funny about 52/48 balance favoring alliance? Its hard cold data based on sample size of more than 3 million accounts.
---
Doesnt mean that there are more level 60 and active alliance accounts than hirde because there isnt since horde is more popular but originally there have been more accounts created on alliance side. Its just a fact.

You have entire patch cycles to get LFR content done. If you want to do past tiers of content then you need build a group. I'm not sure what the disconnect here is. I don't see how this ruins retail. But, I guess if you don't mindlessly bash retail in this sub you just get downvoted.

If i do MC on wednesday before 10pm am i able to do it again on sunday? (EU server)

*only to be mindless pve grind for honor
---
Honestly, I would prefer not having current AV at all.
---
Its by far the most efficient way to gain honor, so I can't expect to just ignore it and still rank effectively.
---
Theres no queue really
---
Towers are destroyed in this version.  There is no taking back.
---
Even with all its weaknesses, retail is still superior to classic in a lot of ways.
---
WPvP is even better on retail ffs. Saying this as someone who plays alliance on retail, with war mode turned on 100% of the time.

---
Do you really wanna see how many left classic already? Lmao this sub.
---
Its a neck piece so it wont. Only actual keys minus the coffer keys
---
But it would be absurd for Blizzard to continue to allow it.
---
WSG is a flop too. Sure, its nostalgic, and nice when you win. But in pugs, the truth really shines through.
---
CTF is a terrible format for MMOs. All that matters is movement abilities and evading combat. Rogues can completely ignore a flag defender by pressing one button. Druids can ignore any fighting because they can just get a free pass from movement speed inhibitors. If you're trying to chase one down, youre screwed as soon as you get out of range or get slowed. Its the same in retail too, completely broken due to movement ability classes.
---
The best BGs for an MMO like wow will always be capture-point objective BGs like Arathi Basin. They require a fight to occur at designated points, forcing combat and outplays.
---
Here we see the uninformed normie that doesn't understand how the honor system works.  
---
    
---
BGs going live with the new honor reset is absolutely the best option, not dropping it the night before, skewing the standings for a whole week like crazy, leaving it up to whoever can grind the most during the night  
---
As for tomorrow, I am dreading  that AV might actually be the superior honor grind, as I play a druid and have been looking forward to FCing my way to r13 for the past 6 months..
---
&gt;Wrath is retail with worse graphics. 
---
Except it's not, so nice try.
---
I like the idea but the enh points don‚Äôt add enough to the survivability to justify it imo. Also you rarely have the space to be casting 2.5 sec healing waves. U barely have space for 1.5. So def drop all the points in any healing wave talents.
---
No private server I have played on ( nostalrius elysium northdale) 
---
Only northdale had a nerfed AV and even then it wasn't this bad.
---
Nostalrius had in my opinion the best AV.
---
I know it's a meme, but I want to share the opposite spectrum.
---
I think a lot of people try to believe that 8 hours a day is a short amount of time to play. I think a lot of people are addicted and don't want to admit it.
---
I find it incredible that someone can find 8 hours straight to play with a partner. I'm just being honest. Unless it's a "dudes night" or you two don't work at the same time, I just don't see how you can find that time.
---
If you're in a relationship, you should REALLY keep note of how you manage your time. Are you neglecting your partner? Family? Friends?
---
If you're out of a relationship, I think it's fair to make sure you remember if you are putting off real life responsibilities. Are you 30 without a job and not applying to jobs? Are you alienating people because you just want to play WoW 16 hours a day?
---
Ultimately, how you live your life and spend your time is yours. Nothing wrong with enjoying WoW.
---
But personally, I do feel much happier in my life since I stopped the 16 hour sessions I would do in WOTLK to minimal time now. Despite being busier, I'm far happier and do feel healthier not having that constant urge to be playing 8+ hours a day.
---
 I do think more people are addicted than they want to admit, and are hurting aspects of their life by playing so much.

Asmon's toxic schtick he puts on for the stream encourages people to be toxic in a video game, Ice is just a piece of shit in general who doesn't care about what happens to those around him in the real world. There's certainly overlap between online assholes and real life ones, but lets no pretend they're the same thing. Ninja looting in wow is never going to be even close to as bad as destroying someone's property in real life, period.
---
If u type afk you'll be kicked so that's why the dude left
---
We've not had to really deal with mana for a decade.
---
If that were the case then more people would be playing BFA than classic. Which is not the case FYI.
---
&gt;And anyways whats so funny about 52/48 balance favoring alliance? 
---
That's not he funny part, it's that if this sub is anything to believe you'd think it's 70/30 favoring the horde, at least. Even OPs own analysis assumes the overall ratio would favor horde 
---
&gt;Doesnt mean that there are more level 60 and active alliance accounts than hirde because there isnt since horde is more popular but originally there have been more accounts created on alliance side. Its just a fact.
---
This is the most unintelligible thing I've read all day. "There are more horde because horde is more popular" is not a valid statement, particularly when the only data you have available is currently showing the opposite (be it true or not). And unfortunately just following up your ramblings with "it's just a fact" does not make it a fact.
---
Cos ally got their shit together and horde dont even know how the bg works lol. Legit see horde just trying to pvp and cap gys and towers
---
Are you describing classic spells or retail classes here now?

---
The cat is out of the bag a long time ago so to speak. People figured out AV more than a decade ago and rush strats have been the norm since then.
---
As I mentioned in a previous comment, both private servers and Blizzard attempted to restore the original version of AV (Blizzard basically fully restored the original version for their classic PVP event) and both on private servers and the original AV they had in BfA was rushed through as quickly as possible.
---
You can recreate the old game, but you can't force players to unlearn one and a half decade's worth of optimization.
---
But can't only your team see what you write?
---
Yeah, and yet people played a bunch of different versions.
---
I think I do and I still do. Having a lot of fun playing and socializing with people.
---
This post aged well.
---
Forgive the ignorance but is classic AV the one that grants exp for completing the BG, or is it the one where you get tokens you have to turn in?
---
Essentially I‚Äôm lvl51 and trying to figure out if I can level effectively by doing BGs. Tired of dungeons and questing is impossible on my server.
---
Turns out he was right I have 30 second queues unplayable
---
Will watch that video now, but the explanation I had heard was the dark portal model used to be a placeholder for instance portals and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre around. Real instances obviously have a real portal now.
---
I had never heard this and it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense in wow lore to me, but if it‚Äôs in a dev diary it‚Äôs hard to dispute that..
---
Type ‚Äû/afk remove‚Äú works better imo
---
How do I leave Battlegrounds? Clicking on the faction icon by the minimap brings up no option to leave before the game ends.
---
queues are literally 1 minute lol
---
we're the testers
---
why spend lot money when little do trick
---
Don't be afraid now, I made a call for you. Two nice gentlemen in white outfits will come get you and take you to a place where you will get the help you need, ok?
---
Right! People out there saying "oh it's just the combat log, you can read it" must be speed readers with an extra set of eyes if they can do that and pvp at the same time.
---
30 second queues for horde lawl nice prediction bozo
---
Bro listen to yourself. I am saying old content is actually fun and you literally said
---
&gt;LFR is a loot pinata
---
How about go enjoy urself and quit harrassing me...
---
Ya I'm a priest and this happened to me. Died before so not sure what triggered it.
---
You realize the mode running right now is a direct copy of the mode as it was in 1.6? That was the whole point of his comment...
---
Lmao, you‚Äôre pretending fully geared and buffed up gameplay is the same as pugging dungeons?
---
This aged well
---
This av doesn‚Äôt have mines?
---
Finished the floors, trim, garage, and lighting.
---
Wife is super awesome for not getting on me about it
---
Welcome to 1.12 AV
---
No The tanking set is not good because you need to drop form for roots and NS heal etc so the cenarion / stormrage set gives you what you need with armor stam mana and heals.
---
widepeepoHappy lolw slamed and farded
---
Tank warrior here. I rock a 1h and shield for most of the fights I'm tanking, but on some fights, like Onyxia, I swap back and forth. But after the changes today, one handed weapons like Mirah's Song (that can be equipped in either hand) replace my MH weapon. Previously, the one hand weapon would replace my shield and I'd switch to dual wielding, but I can't do that anymore. Does anyone have a work around for this?
---
2-4 minutes for AV. Not sure about WSG
---
am I that old? Damn
---
&gt;You seem to be taking this pretty personally for some reason. 
---
You are here arguing with me, so you seem to be taking this personally too.
---
&gt;He also said he doesn‚Äôt have the ability to do it(for whatever reason) so I don‚Äôt know why just because someone CAN technically do something, everyone acts as if that is the end of the discussion. People seem to act as if you have ANY problems with something that you need to sit down and shut up if you don‚Äôt do everything yourself. Seems pretty scummy to have that outlook to me.
---
Just because you have a problem with something doesnt make it scummy either. If you think other people need to come up with loot rules that you like, even when you're not the one organising the raid, then maybe you're the scummy one. 
---
&gt;Also, talk to him, I just clarified what he said since some people have poor reading comprehension.
---
I already did before you even replied, so you're the one with poor reading comprehension i'm afraid. Next time look into a mirror before throwing around insults.
---
Idiots
---
Adibags also does not display, hopefully updates will come soon.
---
Is a crusade only of the brave.
---
Blizzard releases content &gt; people speed run the content &gt; bitch about no content &gt; quit til new content patch
---
Rinse and repeat
---
You'll hate me for saying this but they'll very quickly realize it's more efficient to AFK out and take the 15 minute deserter than to be stuck in a 90 minute turtle. And then it'll be a dozen or two leftovers who run back and forth looking for the few remaining players left to kill.
---
Because everyone playing WSG is in a premade, can't play that alone.
---
Oh first it was 30 minute queues for horde always now it‚Äôs OMG ITS THE FIRST DAY NO ONE WILL PVP AFTER TODAY LOL you lost dude just admit it.
---
Found one that worked, thanks
---
Do you know how long it will take to grind?
---
I feel like, at this point the dude is already in the shit-house with his wife, so why not just go oh ahead and clear the instance too while you're already in trouble for being a shit
---
Stormherald the shaman here, figured I recognized that name and character.
---
Nah this place is exactly like r/wow it's endless bitching
---
Av is for the epics
---
I would recommend something like this . You can always trade natures swiftness for elemental mastery if you want more offense against large groups. Most of your effective healing will come from  lesser healing wave because it's faster.  This will make you useful in a team fight because you can defend yourself and continue to buff allies. Healing wont be a priority , but you can pocket heal a tank pretty efficiently until back up arrives.

Yup.
---
No, I said trying to use LFR to run old content is against the design of it. I never said old content wasn't fun. I just merely said that you have to build a group for it. This doesn't ruin retail.

Pounce, only works from stealth. Kitty version of rogues cheap shot.
---
For anyone just wondering. This was in faerlina, this happen about a month ago around 1-3am and forgot I took a screenshot of it until I seen it this morning. He was our shaman healer going into BRD and after waiting at least an hour for a tank, he pulls this one on us. I know he's probably trolling but I just thought it was pretty funny thats all lol.
---
most ppl just want to get their epic ring/offhand fast
---
Well I only played one as DPS and tank in vanilla so I guess that would be helpful context that I should have mentioned.
---
There is no one left in the world. Today I announced in ungoro the location of rich thorium 3 times and in 10 mins no one came to get it. Everything is back to normal, if you see max level opposite faction they are just there to farm and couldn't be bothered with you. Same level players are cautious because if they start a war there is no 60 backup to help.

8 Hour AVs on Nos wut, I remember them being anywhere from 5-10 minutes long with the longest one being 30-40 minutes, you can actually find videos on YouTube of AV on Nos with the matches being less than 30 minutes.
---
I really wish Blizzard would Fix stuff like this. Yes it would be a change, but stuff like this weren't known about in Vanilla. Some of these quirks are gamebreaking, like the warrior Slam bug which makes 2H fury pretty much the highest DPS in the game right now.
---
I mean I‚Äôm horde and I have 30 second queues seems like logical thinking
---
that's awesome, I think my guild would definitely use this! It would probably do well on this subreddit
---
I remember being blacksmith and having those keys inside the keyring. So I'm pretty sure you're wrong.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. It's been nothing but amazing people for me. The discord is also really active.
---
wait, do you sell the actual fish or the growth elixir?
---
That's not natural selection.
---
People call it turtling. I call it defence.
---
people will default to the most efficient way of grinding.
---
Because you ended up fighting other players, you know that pvp thing.
---
I was a hunter in vanilla and chose mage in classic for the utility and ability to make gold. I'm always the made fun of class.
---
Imagine wanting to play a 40v40 bg and bypassing the entire enemy team to pretend its a raid boss speedrun.
---
Far more than 50 so it isn't going to show you anything you can't see from the screenshot.
---
Damn that is way easier than I expected!! I am alliance. Have been grinding for my epic mount. I currently have 700g
---
Why would typing /afk remove afk?  People fall for it at least once and never again
---
What turtles and how does one force em?
---
LH used old AV. It didn't stop people from rushing.
---
This AV rules.
---
New? people were typing this 15 years ago.
---
What part of rule 3 is he breaking?
---
I would disagree with the latter portion, because them using an emote  saying they "stole" (i'm assuming this is what you meant instead of stop) does not have unintended consequences that affect your gameplay, getting a 15 minute deserter buff does.
---
I personally love it win or lose tbh. This is way better PvP
---
everything is cringe when youre 16
---
Ok boomkin
---
Retail players were told fairy tales and believed them
---
But we have to play it to get the exalted rewards
---
Parrots in the oven.
---
What is sad is that all the pvpers looking to rank though wsg and ab won‚Äôt be able to do it if they want to get past r9. AV gives 2-3x more honor so the pvp system is literally be turned into a repetitive pve system.
---
On the + side I can actually enjoy pug vs pug in wsg and ab. But anyone serious about ranking will find themselves experiencing an even more tedious grind then world pvp.
---
You weren‚Äôt just wrong - you were 1800% wrong
---
Rushing to complete the objective of the battleground isn't win trading, it's the most efficient way to grind honor/rep via AV.
---
I really wish they'd given us the better version. Not this shit.
---
no it's not lol
---
This isnt pvp lmao. You dont do any pvp at all
---
dude retail is old school AV for 3 months and classic has the newer version of AV.

Oh God the hypocrisy is PALPABLE.
---
There is a users name being displayed who wrote the troll emote
---
It's basically just Nature Warrior, Elementalist Mage, and Shitty Resto Druid now.
---
Except that they skipped the best AV?
---
Blizzard announced ages ago we are getting 1.12 AV, everyone knew what was up. Idk where these people you're talking about are.
---
Keep yelling "I told you so!" though if it makes you feel like a big man or whatever.
---
Yeah I did right after this video lol. Almost left those out..
---
Dude, it's a prank. I fell for something similar in D2 years ago. You laugh at yourself for being a dumbass and move on. Fucking snowflakes man.
---
BUT 0 towers dead? 5min av oO
---
Thats another selling point.  Only reason I am swords is because I was daggers in original vanilla.  Just wanted to do something different.
---
Yeah people don't understand that twinks are 
---
 easily caped in gear whilst 60s are not often on same level playing field so you can be shit and decked out in naxx gear and do well. I don't know why people think twinking is less skill, it isn't.
---
You absolutely can force people to play a certain faction by implementing faction queues. Yea people might get separated but let that be incentive to roll on the other faction. What faction you play on really isn‚Äôt that important. Not nearly as important as proper balance.
---
No one care about honor kills, ppl just want to farm honor reward, medals and rep.
---
The quickest I had was 30 minutes. On average it was 2 hours. At worst it was 16 hours.
---
I see where this was supposed to be funny
---
Best av, the original version, could go hours. It was the best thing ever.
---
Already gave it to a friend.
---
So what you‚Äôre implying is that retail is too difficult and needs to be made easier?
---
Prove me wrong! If you believe it or dont understand the difference between a mage port and a summoning ritual, you deserve to get yeeted out of the game.
---
No there isn't
---
Yes I agree. Your gear farm is more important than the PvP experience of everyone else.
---
Here‚Äôs the deal with how guilds Typically run an MC raid. You need 2 prot warriors as MT/OT, then usually a feral Druid tank is 3rd tank. Then usually you have two warriors that run as fury and will be Offtanks when bosses require. 
---
Swap to dps, make it known that you would like to be a backup tank and tank on fights like Garr and Sulf and Domo. They will give you loot after the MT and OT have their loot.
---

We just had our 2nd binding drop and I received felheart shoulders from baron. pray there isn't a rollback.

Cross-realm trading.
---
I'm sure it was a personal attack against you and your guild, op.
---
Yeah, there aren't gonna be many facets of the game that aren't tainted by it, from the looks of things. Tbh, raiding might be the easiest thing to avoid them in, pretty easy to join a guild apart from it that way. But anything in the world/pvp is gonna *have to be* efficient...
---
I personally used to find the mage portal wall shtick hilarious.
---
A lot of people were upset about the expected state of AV pre-release.
---
Fairbanks is a server, you dingo
---
The Classic AV event on retail is actually better than this version If it's just constant zergs or people just love to turtle.
---
source?
---
Farm pve for pvp? Please explain?
---
Do not come to darn, its my sanctuary

That's the server...

Give them a break, they've only had a decade and a half to get this patch right.

Hey, can you upload your 19 Druid vs a 19 Priest? Show us how much fun that is.
---
didnt read
---
Oh, my. I can certainly see why Blizzard made this an urgent issue to fix.
---
Imagine taking the servers down most of the day and then doing a realm shutdown in prime raid hours.
---
Small indie company.
---
He is still recovering from the abuse of the past few weeks. Maybe in time he will become himself again.
---
Right. My original comment was that it'd be interesting to see a server with this same functionality but without all the weird shit that's been added over the years. I'd probably play casually if there were heirloom sabers or horses or gyphons instead of an actual rocket you ride on. Idk, it's just off putting.
---
They did decide. Making the 1.12 AV was the easiest from a technical perspective and that is probably why they went with it. They did spend a bluepost dicussing why they chose to go with the version of AV that they thought would be most "classic".
---
AV boss rushing.
---
Hunters get large ammo specific bags dont they? Totems is 4. Idk about buff reagents. Soul shards get a special bag too dont they?
---
the games arn't even comparable and blizzard just makes bad games now, like look at D4 they just make stuff that looks prettier and forgot how to actually make real games
---
No changes was 100% on board with 1.12 replicated exactly.
---
Yes. It's cross-realm. Might need to wait more than 3 minutes but it'll be there
---
Believe it or not people used to play wow for fun, not to minmax every fraction of a second to be "efficient".
---
Horde won world PvP on all of the realms and now alliance wins all AVs. Fair trade I'd say.
---
I have to say DPS players do not have a single "wait on dps" bone in their body. They zerg shit so fast. On the flip side my ability to generate snap threat is very honed haha.
---
I played vanilla wow during my high school years and I remember very long AV games.
---
People were fighting for days.
---
So it's not a fairy tale.
---
Regardless of spec really, the main stats you're looking for in PvP gear is stamina and intellect (And to use leather. Ideally with high armor, but mainly just avoid cloth). Stamina is obvious, and int is easy to see the benefit from with a balance or resto (or hybrid thereof) spec. But really, even as a feral you'll be doing a lot of shifting in and out of forms, will need to heal yourself a lot, cast entangling roots on kiting targets, using moonfire on kiters/runners and so on. You need a lot of mana. 
---
You won't be doing a lot of uninterrupted damage, and fights (1v1s especially) are more like marathons than sprints as a druid. In cat pve gear you'll hit them hard when you do hit, but you might get more opportunities to get up close to hit them, or survive long enough to hit them, wearing intellect gear.
---
I miss the days of casting Portal to Silvermoon in AV and saying "Click to summon mage table!"
---
Same
---
A lot of horde are dumb and spam to kill Belinda.
---
It really is super dumb.
---
Might be certain realms were flagged connected.
---
Druid represent! I rolled Druid myself because I was sure I'd be burning out quick if I was forced to a single spec. I am now HotW/NS. I heal raids, tank dungeons, and on my free time I like running around in Cat and fite.
---
Haven't really heard any good ones myself. Most of these are just lame and made up.
---
The only one i remember is one a friend of mine said to me during some tyrs hand grinding.
---
"Sorry i got to brb, i just popped a zit and im bleeding like hell"
---
He came back a few minutes later and said
---
"Had to get some paper, fucking zits!"
---
I dont remember which of my RL friends this was, or if he was just my brothers friend. But apparently he had a zit problem:P
---
I have the screenshot still. Poor guy.
---
Can I be you
---
Everyone wanted 1.12 aka Nostalrius.
---
Currently this is the fastest way for AV rep for both sides.  
---
Soon, the desire for honor will outpace rep, and less rushing will happen.
---
This is a consequence of regional BGs though.
---
Lmao. Waiting for your acknowledgment for being wrong and subsequent apology please üòä
---
The #nochanges crowd, or anyone that actually played vanilla, wanted 1.5 or 1.8 AV.  There was a ton of complaining when they announced 1.12 AV but cata babies like you didn't even know what we were talking about.
---
They are doing a server restart. Who knows when they will come back.
---
Anyone have recs on east coast servers to transfer to? I'm on a west coast server now which won't jive with my work schedule for raids. Two big concerns are an active server with decent end game guilds, and relatively balanced factions for decent world pvp.
---
When someone says "y'all" online you know they're strange
---
Actually if you paid any attention I didn't leave the BG... How do you think I got the rest of the Screen Shots if I go kicked out of the BG from typing /AFK?
---
Nope
---
this is a standard strat
---
If someone does that in an AV just report them for afk and they'll get kicked because it's really hard to drop the idle debuff since it's a zero fest with virtually no PvP combat. They wont do it again.
---
OK I tried logging in... 6:50 PM PST... no servers available? What am I missing?
---
They had to shut the servers down to fix some major bugs.
---
Win trading is *trading wins*. 
---
All of the examples you gave are the two teams making a strategic decision independently (nobody is communicating to organize it) that rushing the faction raid is the most efficient way to win the BG.
---
That's not win trading. It just isn't. You can argue that it's shitty, but it's not win trading.
---
Why would you? Classic is better
---
Lol who the fuck finds that out, and why?
---
Yes. I agree lol. I just hate seeing "hur de hur NATURAL SELECTION!" On something like this. Car crashes due to faulty brakes....NATURAL SELECTION.
---
Clearly I am way too animated on the subject, but omfg lol.
---
I appologize to all of Reddit for this comment and the other.
---

---
I just quoted what you said, it‚Äôs another excuse
---
Has anyone seen any communication from Blizz on this? Were others kicked in-game?
---
1.12 is a bad patch.  Lots of "catch up" style changes to the game. Give me a classic + that is \~1.2 and ill delete my two 60s right now and start fresh.
---
" We have to do a very quick restart to pick up a fix for a priority bug. " So who knows
---
Gaming laptop batteries die very fast when not plugged in

That was like 2 patches of vanilla - this version was in vanilla too.

They were fighting long in a very specific match release version. That‚Äôs not this version. In 1.12 they zerged the boss.

Why play a game that's fun but makes it a challenge to get good gear when you can play a game that's quick, streamlined, and passes out gear like candy?
---
...
---
Did I just describe Classic and Retail?
---
100 gold says this guy spams "g o t o re t a il" after ganking someone fighting a mob 4 vs 1.
---
"We have to do a very quick restart to pick up a fix for a priority bug."
---
This warrior in wsg picks up the flag and almost immediately goes "shit pizza here" and drops the flag and afks for a few mins.
---
you get 1 rep per turn-in... i wouldn't say insane.
---
That was not 1.12
---
Blizzard really needs to release some new classic style servers with the next expansion. Even if all they did was remove sharding and cross realm, it would make the community 100x better (and I'l probably play it again).
---
Who gave you those answers?
---
Server list just came up, servers should be active in a few minutes.
---
why... why do people still take screenshots with their phone? Is it so hard to post a normal screenshot?
---
Can finally get in to see realms but they are offline give it just a few minutes I'm sure it will be back up soon.
---
Huh that would kind of explain why it's super easy to just zerg
---
People aren't playing either game because of what Org looks like.  Come on now.
---
Your post say 23 minutes ago. Oof. Bad timing.
---
Just in case what? Your delivery driver hits on you?
---
Literally no one did. The No Changes group wanted the original AV - they warned the community that the version blizz was putting was gonna be awful and they were right and for some reason they're being blamed???
---
It was probably just the easiest to implement.  Pretty much every poor decision they've made concerning classic has come down to laziness.  What is the most money they can leech while doing the least amount of work?
---
Stop doing that, I'm using my AV trinket to teleport to base and Aoe / Sapper with mages and wipe alli's silly all in rush.
---
That's normal. 5 minute matches are not normal.
---
Ok no
---
Wow Classic has been canceled due to disinterest.
---
the honor is absurd yea but when every1 is getting it its not lol
---
Hello fellow Bloo-moo resident.
---
You get honor - both in WPvP and BGs - from being in a group/raid with others and honor is split evenly. 
---
You do not get honor for healing people outside of group - only those in your group/raid.
---
Bold strategy, Cotton.
---
From what I've seen here, the prevailing reason seems to be to prevent cross-server trading in BGs. So if that's the case it should just be a quick patch and the servers should be up within an hour or two
---
Bro everyone lives in a country
---
No they're playing classic cause it's not a landfill.
---
I mean I wasn't before either. :-P
---
It's BS, I was so looking forward to old AV where you can gather resources and release awesome NPCs that matter. They released some trash new AV version that is ruined like everything they touch.
---
did in original, forgot on second, my b
---
I feel for people getting interrupted in raids, but they definitely didn't have "over a decade to work on this specific patch." It's not literally copy-pasted from Vanilla considering some changes to things like battle groups, and Classic has only been in development for a couple years.
---
Am I the bad person for thinking I would probably click the link to that just once?

---
I play Alliance on classic lel
---
How is this PVP??
---
Most AV's go the entire game where 90% of the raids don't touch an enemy player.
---
No, she was spitting out headphones from her mouth
---
unlikely, AV is better for ranking than wsg compared to nostalrius seems like
---
In Vanilla WoW, there was absolutely rushing. Maybe not immediately but AV was solved and became quite rythmic after a while.
---
Everyone jerking over the half dps increase on some BIS enchant they put on their new raid loot, sleeping on the carrot, the glove enchant, and the mithril spurs.
---
If you treated AV the way you did gearing for MC, mount speed would be required to have on alt gear to switch between.
---
It seemed very buggy. You could single pull guards at the graveyards, etc.
---
I'm hoping the current patch is to fix it.
---
It's taco tuesday bro
---
Is this a possibility?
---
Yeah, having a leader board was kinda nice....
---
It‚Äôs back
---
No one seems to understand this.
---
Well the people saying they were going down forever were obv trolls but the other answers seemed sorta plausible to me
---
Masturbate
---
Lol you're the garbage rogue that kept getting owned in Org on Rattlegore for like 3 days straight.
---
They read all the hate here and posts about how classic is dead and terrible and just decided to call it a day and shut the servers down.
---
There's a screenshot with 1 honor kill and 5min av duration on this sub already though.
---
ive seen no proof but rumour is you could cross realm trade items , so its prob for the best they disable this for now
---
They're back on now so it's all good
---
theyre up now
---
Servers back up
---
Hey! Me either lol
---
This is me, rofl. Healing Gear, Tank Gear, PvP Gear, Cat Gear, and then those trinkets. Even my bank is full now and I don't even have an epic mount yet so I can't justify spending more gold on bank slots.
---
That was during a time when players were confined to a server and reputation &amp; guilds mattered.
---
???? Blizzard made it clear what version of classic y'all were getting.
---
It‚Äôs not even just retail players being deceived. It‚Äôs also old players returning and fooling themselves.
---
Nope, and it didnt exist in my vanilla server either. 
---
    Infact if you are fishing on my current server I see most people purposely trying to fuck with said person.
---
    Double infact if you were worth honor before bgs and I saw you fishing, id kill you 4 times till there was full honor dr, just like any other player.
---
This was the fix .. I didn't rename the file, but I did create a new nvidia profile for the wowclassic.exe. Fixed it right up. Thanks for posting, probably would not have figured that out, ever.
---
Within about 6 levels of each other, it's more optimal to enjoy questing with your friend than worry too much about the level difference.
---
The old AV had way more NPCs, people were focused more on capturing objectives to reduce the opponents reinforcements and there was a lot more actual PvP. It felt like a epic battle instead of a race to find out which side has the better tanks and healers.
---
How could they ever have predicted that people would approach this game like a job and play it relentlessly until they'd figured out the easiest way to exploit everything. 
---
People used to love this battleground. The battleground is still the same. The difference is that the players are sweaty adult psychopaths now.
---
Haven‚Äôt played yet but yea it‚Äôs sad to hear that the Newley implemented AV is already being abused to a point we‚Äôre you can‚Äôt even play for objectives,etc. 
---
First day....... WOW must have caught blizzard by big surprise! üòí
---
Unless you are playing with Russians. Those guys just wanna fight 40v40 all the time
---
We had a r14 HWL in our guild in vanilla and it was weeks on weeks of 3 guys rotation for 24/7 coverage in BGs. It was insane.
---
Prison key isn't an instance key, but it does last.
---
Why are you so mad lmao? They told y'all you were getting 1.12, stop bitching about it just cause retail has ONE thing superior to classic
---
But you can play classic super casually? Once you finish the small grind to lv/gear a char you only need to farm for 30-60min for consumable money and do a 1h~ raid once a week?
---
I remember doing this to people I'm vanilla. I cant believe it's a thing still. Thank you for sharing this. Please tell me you fell for it.
---
? Vanilla WoW didnt release with 1.12 talents or balance either, so what the fuck is your point?
---
It‚Äôs not even just ‚Äúhurdy dur, stupid retail player being fooled‚Äù. It‚Äôs old boomer ass players that are returning after years absence fooling themselves as well. Dumb people being dumb is all.
---
this is this shittiest version of AV. there is no pvp in it, just mindless zerg to kill some shit pve content. in order to rank you have to do it over and over again until it becomes insufferable.
---
 
---
enjoy!
---
at this point you don't even know if ppl that are responsible with classic wow are plain idiots or just sabotaging the game.
---
Not on the biggest one that I cant name without my post being deleted. We Had matches last hours and sometimes day's and it was the first version of AV.
---
You may have mental faculty issues
---
it was the meta in vanilla wow before bc.
---
I didnt predict queues, I just countered OPs post because if horde DOES has queues, then ally will be destroyed in the world like it was phase 2 again.
---
You can just afk now, 5 min matches
---
One complaint to the next, we cant enjoy wpvp because theres too many horde and now you cant enjoy bgs because people are trying to get rep and win fast.
---
This is not 2004, this is 2019. People min max in mmos way more, or atleast they try to do a lot of optimal things so they can flesh out a stromg character. It is just the way shit has been for years now.

You think you do but you don't..
---
Ah fair enough!  I am currently swords trying to get into daggers, but I'm not sure I can find preraid bis daggers that would do better dps than sword of zeal and mirahs, so I'm waiting for sweet raid drops if I ever can get into MC ha
---
I feel like an idiot - I told my guild that it would be about 20m long and they called me insane.
---
Nope. 
---
I'm in Europe.
---
I've had to deal with the retards over at Blizzard customer support for a week now (7 tickets) trying to recover an item I deleted only days prior to the initial ticket. I deleted the enchant "Fiery Blaze Enchant" from a quest in the Badlands. Only to soon after realize it would be a good item to put on my Ravager axe for AoE. I then get told that "White items are deleted quicker from our logs" and that "we want your choices to matter". It is absolute bullshit that they refuse to return quest items that were sold/deleted. There is no integrity issue whatsoever involved with returning these types of items. Yet their incompetent customer support would rather not restore it and leave a customer angry than realize that there is no harm returning such a thing.
---
But Blizzard will be Blizzard.
---
yeah crossrealm av is why this doesn'T exist anymore. Too many min/maxers around in AV queues.    
---
Sure av wouldn'T open on some servers othervise but with all those noobs around rush bgs would happen way less.
---
The trolls are the natives to azeroth. Everyone else are the invaders.
---
then there's me just randomly meowing and sometimes yelling to kill that kitty
---
Fuck man you have no idea what I went through trying to remember the Improved SS cost. I was like I'll be damned if I fucked up this joke because I know I'll get called out on it. These are WoW players. They know those numbers better than they know the frontside of their cock. I started playing WoW at classic release and stopped after like 3 months, haven't played in a bit, so I forget the numbers. I googled SS, then directory to ISS.. page is down. God dammit
---
Best one I've had is mid naxx "brb going to have a shower and get some cheese"
---
It's better. You get waaay more honor, but less rep. Rep isn't exactly hard to come by though - honor is harder.
---
This isn't what PvP was like on either vanilla wow for the private servers. PvP servers is the real experience but this is just poorly thought out trash we have gotten for as far as PvP is concerned.
---
Wow is down for me so can't look at my macro but you need to do a /equipslot X Mirah's Song so the weapons/shield go into the right equipment slots. X being a number of course.
---
DM T 5/10
---
Hunter Q 6/10 (if you do all bosses actually solo and without warlock curse)
---
Mara 4/10
---
Didn't work.
---
Obviously you‚Äôre not on the true heartseeker
---
because back then there were no real addon sites which everyone knew about, there were a couple of addons but they were few and far between and nothing that makes a huge difference.
---
Keyboard warrior here. To protect and serve all his fellow troll/griefers!
---
Spy being dead has nothing to do with KoS lists.  There could be an addon dedicated entirely to this.
---
Sure but I have no faith in blizzard or the pserver meta.
---
I'd say a majority of the people I notice will stop to kill me when I'm fishing.  I've even been camped while fishing.
---
I get that people are jerking off over honor but killing fisherman is pretty lame.
---
To be fair, I was going to roll on Horde on BB if they were truly dead.  Less competition for R14
---
How do you make a "new profile?"
---
av was always going to be pve with some pvp mixed in. best strat is killing lieutenants as horde and letting alliance win, not zerging. turtle is the worst.
---
&gt; The battleground is still the same. 
---
no, it is not, at least have the fucking decency to google shit before u spill your ignorant crap
---
Finding ret paladin engaging and other classes boring is very unique, more power to you though.
---
AV is for PVE, WSG and AB is for PvP.
---
Not dismissing the rest of your post, but
---
&gt;Viable = a possible class, with the right raid composition
---
Ret Paladins have no right raid comp. They bring nothing a Holy Paladin can't bring, while also being arguably the best healer in the game.
---
This is fucking trash, the best WSG premades cant keep up with this, grats on rank 14 to 24 hour account sharing/botting solo players.
---
See no problem with this outside of bgs.
---
Retail has many issues, but I'm kinda baffled over your microtransaction comment. Did you know they added the underlying support for paid transfers in Classic this patch?
---
Hey, just wanted to come back and say I was having a shitty day at work and left some shitty replies to you. I read this last one and I agree with you here.
---
Sorry for the shitty replies earlier. Something in your above replies triggered me without warrant due to the day I was having and I wanted to come back to apologize
---
No, it's rp instance...what the hell
---
you can take them back before they get destroyed!?
---
"Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game."
---
Same. Fuck sake.
---
BLIZZARD BAD!
---
Going to the store instead of door dash.   If you go to the store, shower please.  I don‚Äôt need your stank next to my apples
---
Orgrimmar has always been a landfill
---
It‚Äôs so annoying!!!
---
I doubt it was a surprise. Private server players have been saying since before classic even launched this is how av would be.
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
Hahaha, chill. I'm guessing you're one of the people furiously grinding AV rep in your underwear?
---
I don't care enough about this conversation to do a single second of research, but my point is still completely relevant: the concept of blending pvp and pve in a raid battleground was immensely popular in vanilla. 
---
The problem isn't with the battleground. If people weren't trying to squeeze this game to death for fifteen year old digital rewards then we wouldn't be having this conversation.
---
things on the private servers were also not terribly close to what vanilla was, i think il try it.
---
Because $15 a month is a negligible amount of money.
---
so two arrows hit the target instead of one. duh.
---
The faction "cities". Horde = Shrine of Two Moons and Alliance = Shrine of Seven Stars.
---
641g
---
Even back in the day when stuff got really fucked and they DID reward extra time, nobody ever got a month. You'd get a day at best.
---
And ever since they announced 1.12 AV the players that actually understood what that meant were pissed.  Do you have a point?
---
I dc'ed after the fix and right when i was joining av
---
I reconnect to find my self stuck in an empty score board. I cant get back in queue :( help anyone?
---
Well, I play a couple days a week and we raid on this day. It significantly affects our guild. Just pointing out the problem.
---
100$ should do
---
It wasn‚Äôt that great of a joke is the point
---
Worth the attention to point out that their action has done a bit of damage. Doesn't matter to the scale, just the fact that action was taken that hurt the experience of their members.
---
Maybe if you learned the difference between ignorance and stupidity you might actually not make yourself look like an ass.  
---
:\]
---
good
---
I remember getting it on my warrior back at the end of vanilla, was a good weapon
---
Your 15 minutes at $15 p/month comes to about $0.003 I‚Äôm sure the check is in the mail.
---
You can't make these people happy. They didn't want classic, they wanted a fucking time machine.

---
brb bowflexing
---
So you're just lying now?  We've been bitching about 1.12 AV since it was announced.  You probably just didn't understand what the adults were talking about.  I'm pretty sure private servers use the 1.8 or 1.5 version.
---
try /afk
---
People are winning without killing another player. Hard to call it player vs player.
---
It‚Äôs also what adds to its mystery, which I really really enjoy to be honest
---
It's funny how people wanted no changes, now that people are actually playing classic they realize some changes would be nice.
---
This is pretty much how Old school runescape went as well.
---
Action is action. It's about showing respect and care to your members, not the value.
---
I definitely remember tiping 1g for 5stavk of water in av earlier
---
Any guild deciding to raid on the day of a big patch needs to be prepared for the occasional bug reset to address something.
---
Just pointing out the problem in the most obnoxious way possible.
---
Yeah I play regularly on my laptop and it'll die in like20 minutes on mid graphics if not plugged in.
---
Night reaver or Crescent staff?
---
its going to be the same, if the backdoor jump works then slow falling /noggenfogger slow falling from the clift to the left can skip a hunters frost trap/blizzard spam.
---
Thank you for at least bringing a good point to the table in comparison. I understand that, but it is still a large disruption.
---
You can prevent the enemy from destroying the towers.  There is no taking back, as they are never taken in the first place.  They are destroyed.
---
This is why i cancelled my sub.
---
World pvp is ruined for a second time and at the very least they could of delivered old AV and failed at that aswell.
---
I simply dont understand the concept of joining a PVP server then crying about it - but once again the carebears have won.
---
I find it hilarious that blizzard has been "given a second chance" not to run its business into the ground and then it goes and repeats the exact same mistakes of the past.
---
Like having a second chance at life only to drive off a building for the lols.
---
People aren't roasting you for being upset, they are roasting you for demanding a months free play because of a reset to fix a bug after the biggest patch classic has had so far....
---
Neither roll horde.
---
Mvp of the night!
---
It is tagged as gripe/vent. So you chose to come by.
---
When did nochanges turn into somechanges?
---
It has done the trick!
---
well we had long AV's, and very hard ones. Where the NPC's oneshotted you + mines.   
---
But the version we are getting, is AV nerfed over 3 times.   
---
So the AV you are remembering, is maybe one of the other versions.
---
Haha wait till everyone is done grinding AV, don't you worry bozo. WSG queues are already 15min for Horde ;&gt;
---
That‚Äôs annoying and I know what you mean regarding the original behaviour. Can‚Äôt confirm the new behaviour you‚Äôre seeing. 
---
I also recommend just having a macro. I have a DW macro and a 1H/shield macro.
---
I would go with gnome. A warrior naturally struggles against mages (and roots in general) much much more than they do against rogues.
---
I used them as much as possible so I didn‚Äôt look like a fucking idiot with my cyan dress
---
Sure but if you don't put that in your LFG, you're a bit of a dick.
---
If we keep it up maybe blizzard will release star hi basin and bonus honor weekends for Christmas
---
Hahah it will age very well don't worry. Queues will only get worse from here on out, you'll see. 15-min WSG queues on DAY ONE bodes well for the Horde.
---
Do you think nochanges means set everything to 1.12?  Because that's miles from the truth.
---
About as much as it did 15 years ago.
---
Give em a call then
---
Lmao
---
The great thing about wow is each have their own use. But IMO the PVP tier list is strictly Gnome &gt; Dwarf &gt; Human. Perception can be very useful but dodging a blind makes the rogue 1v1 a lot better. Gnome makes a few match ups better but mostly the mage match up. Unfortunately this 1v1 is still tough even with escape artist.
---
Regardless of spec, I recommend going with skinning and mining as professions while leveling. Warriors lose a TON of cash on repair bills, and leveling a profession is a massive time/money sink. Use skinning to sell leather on the AH and/or extra vendor trash. Same with mining, unless you intend to save mats for leveling blacksmithing later - then make an alt for that single purpose and send him everything until you max level and need it. Otherwise, smelt everything and then vendor the bars for extra cash.
---
I have to admit, they are pretty equal in my experience. Especially, SGC. Felt like sweet release.
---
I think a page dedicated to the game is the place to make this type of complaint public? If not then I'm in the wrong place. You chose to come by and reply.
---
So what was the purpose of a multi-day AV, then?
---
And lots of new things were found when they dissected it through private servers through classic.
---
Problem with some of the talent system is that some talents boost leveling and some boost spells.  I hate talents in games that extend duration or cooldown; it's lazy design.  
---
But at least you can find gems in wow classic. Retail is vomit and when you compare the specs, they feel watered down.
---
lmao GOD WHY DID I READ IT. WHY WHY
---
You've probably already heard this, but in classic, you shouldn't just be running down the road avoiding mobs everywhere you go. You should be killing things on the way from one point to another. Grinding is a huge chunk of the leveling xp in classic, and if you don't do it on the way to and from everywhere you go, you're going to end up having to catch up eventually.
---
I looted my first epic back in vanilla from the harpies in AV. Good ol Dwarven Hand Cannon.
---
Fuck I gtg to the hospital. Buddy ate some gluten earlier and his dick just flew off.
---
This is how you efficiently grind honor. Don't act surprised.
---
AV has not been about the pvp since cross sever bgs started  this is nothing new if you want pvp you have to single queue into wsg ab and hope its not a premade. Because not to soon after premades start to know who is who they will start dodging games because they will know it will take to long and not be worth the honor   once every one start getting 14 then maybe people will start playing to see who is better or for fun but till then rip pvp
---
I remember stunlock warriors. Generally considered more of a "lolspec" it was great for harassing players on graveyard nodes in AV or AB while waiting for backup to arrive.
---
If you only have time to farm for consumables and raid 1 hr a week that "small" grind of leveling and gearing could take you months.
---
&gt; Now keep in mind how Ion has been saying that "Horde v Alliance is the core of WOW" as an excuse on why cross-faction raiding can't be a thing...
---
Because they make stuff up and claim everything is set in stone when, in reality, nothing is set.
---
I've actually been playing since the end of classic/beginning of TBC (unlike all the Rank 14 Naxx raiders) and Blizzard has changed lots of things that they originally said were unchangeable. The biggest ones I can think of off the top of my head are WoW tokens (selling gold with extra steps), faction changes, making characters of both factions on the same PvP server, and character boosts.
---
The way things are going, it looks like they are eventually getting rid of the whole Alliance vs. Horde aspect of this game. It isn't going to happen in Shadowlands, but it could happen in the expansion after that. They'll probably implement some sort mercenary mode that works all the time (without actually changing races) instead of only in BGs.
---
51-60 yes
---
Any estimates as to how long it will take to reach exalted with AV rep with the current 10min games?
---
Seriously? Who cares.
---
But if it would have been truly nochanges then AV would have been harder.
---
you cared enough to comment
---
this was my guess. saw another comment in a diff thread of a guy whose priest friend bugged and was stuck at 1hp. could still take cc and shit but his life was frozen at 1hp. it's something to do if you have a point in a certain priest talent. idr which, never played priest.
---
kk, thanks
---
When you say you see them invited instantly, how do you mean?  You‚Äôre in a group with a mage, someone asks in chat, then they‚Äôre in the group?
---
Ok edit I just had one of those games and it literally took 7 minutes lol I‚Äôm sorry I was quick to assume that‚Äôs my bad bro , but I‚Äôm in another game and I‚Äôm 30 mins in now so I see what you mean
---
Damn I need to make a boomkin
---
Damn I just struggled for so long getting into MC cuz of this (I know the window trick, but the lag was insane and tons of guildies died doing it, I had ony buff)
---
Wish I saw this before! Good tip
---
In the original version of AV u gotta turtle for 2 hours to finish the quest
---
As a PVE player, I‚Äôm not complaining.  Sucks I‚Äôm forced to farm it for some easy BIS gear.
---
If I want PvP, I‚Äôll play any relevant PVP type game.  One where the devs are scared of continued balance, support, and *gasp* changes.
---
pfft how boring. okay kid.
---
run away from the class.
---
Oooohh! Sick burn! (Not really)üôÑ
---
but how? he would literally need the alliance dwarf in the same room as him. this was likely just a one in a million thing.
---
And look to my last post which got hugely downvoted by peoplesaying BG would be shit and not solve anything. 
---
Here we are my friends.
---
You‚Äôve got the right idea.  Of you want bonus points you might find a Blacksmith who can install an iron or mithril shield spike for a little extra group threat.
---
In general with large groups and DPS that won‚Äôt hold still, the best you can do is keep mobs off the healer; just focus on the one or two really dangerous mobs in the pack and let the dps handle themselves.
---
What??? 1.6 AV isnt a change it's how it was when it was released, a change would be implementing something that was not in vanilla simple as that like re-balancing specs or adding Transmog or increasing the debuff limit past what it was in vanilla etc. What we're talking about is the difference between patches it would of been nice to have it release in it's original form, that would be the opposite of a change.
---
Grinds aren't a "challenge", it's just another way of gating gear. It's stupid game design that me as a sole PvE player has to do PvP in order to get the best PvE gear. Makes absolutely no sense and it's something I did not miss about vanilla
---
Gambling
---
Oooohh! Sick comeback (Not really), just leave if you don't care dude, you are a pest
---
Might have been the guy in my guild. He's a priest.
---
&gt; I don't care enough about this conversation to do a single second of research
---
this is another bulshit cause u have no idea what you're talking about.
---
the fact that you're pushing your stupidity upfront doesn't make it right. i see no reason to continue this since you're like the anti-vaxxer of wow.
---
plz fuck off on the block list
---
It still surprises me that theres people who have never summoned either big boi.
---
Jeez I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe they should remember that their great customer service has always been a part of the overall blizzard experience. I guess when they lay off everyone and stretch GM's thin like they do this is what we get.
---
Put one point for 2h mace and axes and equip, this way alliance would not think you are a healer and will not focus on you first.
---
I wish they‚Äôd add flying mounts, I‚Äôm sick of running everywhere.
---
Also a dungeon queue system would be kind of cool.
---
Deep wounds is not good enough for leveling for 3% crit to make a significant difference. I think you mean Impale. I still wouldn't take it over battle stance as the primary stance. For single target, maybe. It's probably a wash between kill speed and downtime. For 2 mobs, I doubt staying in berserker is better. You'll be taking big hits while WW is on CD.
---
Welcome to 1.12 nerfed av
---
You should be sorry.  For someone that is publicly ranting about the state of the game you have very little knowledge of it.
---
Undead players are KiS for me, but I would kill Gnomes if I could
---
it only happens to priests. someone else in the comment chain said what the talent was that made him unkillable too.
---
Although i rolled my warrior as a dwarf, i think gnome is better. Also 3 vs 1 min difference on CD's. Mages are gonna be very hard even as gnome. Warrior is all about getting close to the target, and this is one of the few ways that will help that.
---
Also curious about this
---
Thanks NA betatesters OMEGALUL
---
They put the best gear rewards in AV.
---
Can you blame people for going after the best gear in the fastest way possible?
---
did you have materloot on&gt;
---
Weapon skill is possibly the most under-appreciated stat in Classic WoW. By attacking lower level mobs, you do more damage. Why? Because of their defense values which check against your weapon skill. The higher your weapon skill value over an opponents defense, the less effective their armor is (essentially works like armor penetration).
---
 (We know this because the same rules apply in reverse, when fighting higher level mobs).
---
At some point, usually around 10+ levels higher, your attacks ignore their armor completely. This is why you do so much more damage on lower level mobs - it's not only your player power is higher, their defense/armor is useless against your attack.
---
A man of great wisdom
---
Its working exactly as intended - this is how av was in 1.12 pretty much the TBC version of av
---
You know, if we were fucking ALLOWED to queue with groups, I might get a gang together to set up some really cool defenses and tactics.  
---
But Blizzard intentionally removed that capacity because losing to superior tactics and organization is not allowed.
---
Why are they only 10 min?
---
Yeah I got to play wsg for like  an hour before work. Almost didn't at all cuz I thought servers would be down till 6. Then a Guildie messaged me on disc saying they were up, so I got to sneak a couple games in.
---
Av is pve only. Borring af and 0 skill involved... there are max 5hks in the whole bg. How can you call this pvp?
---
also who even goes to AV for pvp lul its a pve bg
---
we used to have pride, we used to find glory in our kill counts, we used to want to win. Now we realize that winning is inefficient and we just want the rewards :(
---
classes don't really matter when it comes to professions. the exception is casters for the bop robes or whatever it is they get.
---
the most min-max professions to pick are engineering and blacksmithing for glimmering mithril insignia (30 sec fear immune trinket).
---
I was being facetious. The fact is the definition of the spirit of BGs is going to be different from person to person based on which version of AV they remember the most fondly (1.05, 1.12, TBC, etc). Blizzard designers have never released a manifesto defining what their intentions were, so all anyone can do is be speculative. Sure, I'm guessing 7 minutes zergfests were not what they had in mind.
---
He prefers to play warrior without looking at dogshit ugly character models
---
Its so borring. How can you even call this pvp? It takes 0 skill and is pve only... pls make it only give 10% of the honor
---
Wow that's a lot of percentages.  Good job counting that high champ.
---
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed and somewhat amused that you think running from one side to the other to kill some npcs qualifies as "playing" anything.
---
Yes. You will not be in an AV that lasts for days and you will probably never see the raid bosses either. 
---
Classic is very very different from vanilla even though it‚Äôs the same game.
---
happy ccake day m8
---
Anyone remember Nostalrius?  This shit didn't happen.  Leave it to blizzard to fuck the classic experience.  Nostalrius was 100x better than this shit.
---
Killing NPCs is indeed playing something though.
---
80% of this game us about running around and killing NPCs
---
It‚Äôs a meme, sir
---
Long av battle suck. The worst think ever I remember from vanilla.
---
Have you seen dwarf females? They are worse than any horde char model.
---
i was looking forward to farming herbs to r10 but looks like im going to have to participate  1.12 av sux
---
It is. Just not as you intended. Pserver players knew this is how AV would look. It has been discussed off and on since pre-beta. It's a mindless rep grind.
---
I remember getting this trinket back in the day. Is this from the Wetlands or one of those zones?
---
dungeons don't really require tanks in the first place so it's an irrelevant discussion
---
Lol, love how self-deprecating you are. You actually seem like a good guy. Hope you can get over your anxiety.
---
I did leave. If you don‚Äôt want me around, stop engaging me. Why are you wasting your time replying to me? There are more important things to worry about like if a level 50 or whatever should be allowed in a lvl 60 WoW BG. I‚Äôm small potatoes compared to the urgent problem of someone below 60 being allowed in a 60 BG.
---
how bout dont be a dumbass lmao - do you fall for those "x pickpocketed 10s 97c from you" emotes too?
---
*blizz laughter intensifies* yes yes, gooooood give in to your feelings!!!!
---
The no changes guys, of which there are varying degrees, are also the people who know Vanilla better than the people remembering it through rose tinted glasses. Every pserver player and their cat knew that 1.12 AV was going to be distilled down to Zerg meta.
---
Why are you so salty? He didn't kill your cat.
---
Why would you share this
---
Just farm BRD for pre-bis until 60, at least that's what I did
---
Because ActiBlizz put in the new version of AV where theres no NPC elites walking around and Alliance can just zerg in and kill the horde boss. 
---
I was just in a game where all 40 horde and all 40 ally just ran past each other. I stopped still and nobody even took the time to charge me or put a DOT on me. I was out in 3 minutes with zero HKs. Its absolutely fucked.
---
**QUERY**
---
10% from dying to a *non-pvp* instance of damage.
---
ok man, i dont want to engage you or whatever, just don't like it when people act that way and say stuff like "who cares" or whatever, so i feel the urge to comment on it, i dunno, im defensive
---
make Hunters Huntards again!
---
QQ
---
It's this dogshit slipper slope fallacy nonsense that got us in the position where people like you combat objectively healthy changes with the same terrible argument over and over. Thanks for nothing.
---
T-clap is awesome, but really only if you are able to charge a group on the pull, so really only works in dungeons, and only without CC. There's a lot of problems with charging groups for a pull, so it can only be done occasionally. Otherwise, imo it's best to ignore it for what you've got in defensive stance. i.e., demo shout for the initial AOE threat, then tab/sunder.
---
Yes, you shouldn't be able to ignore the bunkers/towers in MC gear.  Really shit the bed on difficulty.
---
No changes
---
Because hunters don‚Äôt have this ability.
---
Idk about you but every match ive been in alliance win but we get less honor than horde.
---
Yes it was quite often in late 1.12 vanilla , most people just race against time,even Horde has disadvantages you can still burn the towers at get honor and reputation. 
---
Well still there would be some geared people loved to trigger the large combat in the middle to cause the match last very long. They don't need ranks or exalted reward, they just want watch the world burn.
---
Why am i not suprised
---
Again, no shredder machines!
---
Av is 0 pvp and pve only. Its so borring and takes 0 skill
---
I think once you get to Mara it's safe to switch to Prot and live there until 60.
---
How are you this stupid?
---
You were never going to hit 14, I'm sorry.
---
I hope they changed something
---
This is how it was in Vanilla. Once games stopped taking hours and hours, rep came very fast. AB and WSG are a different story.
---
It‚Äôs from the quest to kill Gahz‚Äôrilla in ZF. Someone in your group needs a mallet created in the hinterlands to summon it.
---
Lol yeah I just moved my keybinds and I‚Äôm still clunky :/
---
&gt;Av is 0 pvp and pve only. Its so borring and takes 0 skill
---
"OMG TORNADO" is our traditional alt-f4 farewell.
---
For me personally, farming for 1 really low drop chance item that sells for a lot  is not worth it. I like to farm items that sell for about double or triple the vendor price that drop very frequently and stack in your inventory. I like doing this because it helps me keep going when I can see my gold steadily rise, instead of farming for hours with nothing to show for it just hoping the next kill makes the last 4 hours worth it. Also, when farming many many mobs for lots of drops, you still have that tiny chance of finding a boe purple drop that sells for hundreds of gold. My current favorite farm is the blasted lands buff materials, such as Scorpoks pincers, basilisk brain, vulture gizzards, and boar lungs. They sell for between 80s and 90s on my server
---
You're actually talking about skill when ranking is about farming plebs as premade as fast as possible. There's no skill until arenas.
---
It's not broken.
---
That‚Äôs me :) 
---
I do get a *ton* of honor though. Usually get 5ish kills before a death. Have I killed you before?
---
Back in vanilla I had a guildie get up to go to the bathroom, tripped over his dog and put his knee through a glass coffee table. Sliced up his leg real bad and almost cut a vein where it was gg you're dead. He got on chat and told us he had to go to the hospital before logging. No one believed him till he posted pics on our guild forum. Straight up murder scene looking shit.
---
Find a guild who appreciates you. Bears are awesome and have alot of utility.
---
Depends on what you mean by solve. I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs more tolerable to travel around BRM now.
---
üëå
---
6min avs are so borring. Its pve only and takes 0 skill
---
You say it's badly designed because you don't like it.  The success of the game tells me the fact it was extremely successful, despite your opinion.
---
Happy you enjoy it, but don't romantisise a system that was badly designed because it followed the design of being casual friendly and giving participation epics to all players.
---
Do you see it yet?
---
With the release of battlegrounds, twink items will probably be going up in value (no source, don't quote me).  To that end, Shadowfang Keep is a good bet for excellent twink BoEs.
---
Welcome to classic
---
yes this is how it was
---
Even rich/successful people get down on WoW. It‚Äôs likely objectively one of the entertaining things you can possible due with current media. MMORPGs are really a fuckin miracle of modern technology.
---
You better dont play wow. Av is borring and takes 0 skill. Its 0 pvp but pve only
---
It's not like this in the original version of AV.  It's much much more difficult to win.  Zerging really isn't possible.  You have to take down the towers, deal with archers that hit hard, upgraded troops and land mines.
---
N O  C H A N G E S btw
---
Let me guess, you were/are astoundingly bad at math in school
---
hahahahahah implying blizz has any resources still in bfa. that shitshow is a lost cause that no one has cared about for months.
---
just wait when the bot honor farmers get in AV, then we'll have a cozy 20v20 slugfest
---
I've been in here 50 minutes now finally got the GY at the top so we won't get send back to stonehearth lol
---
I like ctp but mostly agree.
---
And lots of people just stay middle in wsg and fight lol
---
Its so borring. Its 0 pvp. Please fix
---
are you actually running wow on your graphics card and not internal graphics? the patch messed that up for a bunch of people
---
I wAs In Av FoR a WeEk iN vAnIlLa!
---
Ok. I get it. I‚Äôll leave my opinions to myself and leave you alone. I‚Äôm just some rando on the internet.  This whole interaction means nothing in the scheme of things. Don‚Äôt waste your energy being defensive to randos on reddit. Life‚Äôs too short for that dude. May your level 60 BG questions get answered satisfactorily  for you. Peace out.
---
Everyone else still complaining though, or they haven't played another AV yet
---
Because this is a highly nerfed version of AV.  The PS used the 1.05 version which was much more difficult to win.
---
Ur thinking pedopedia
---
I've never seen an 8 hour maintenance. Back to bed I guess. Just wanted to play some BGs when they drop, it looks like they've postponed it 7 hours back !
---
Lmao maybe. Maybe everyone went full idiot this whole day.
---
No, out of a purely scientific interest I‚Äôd wanna see a gangrenous asshole just to know what it looks like.
---
Thottbot it my man
---
Gnome by a mile. Escape artist is the *king* racial for warriors across all races not just alliance. It makes the mage matchup actually playable and thats your toughest fight as a warrior.
---
Its so borring. Its only pve and takea 0 skill. Blizzard pls fix
---
Sexy
---
Someone said they stopped people being able to time join for pre mades, so might be more dependent on randoms working together now vs a core who queued together zerging.
---
I didn't mean anything personal by it, 99.9% of people "going for rank 14" just aren't going to make it.
---
Think it‚Äôs time for you to give up
---
100% agree... its so borring and takes 0 skil√∂. Pls fix
---
What, you didn't know that Gnomes have a corkscrew penis akin to that of a duck, just with more cogs and doodads?
---
Thank god they gave us this version, I can get exalted and never queue it again.
---
Farm crusader enchant in WPL.  Just got mine after a few hours.
---
ok boomer
---
Horde are just soft from stomping p2 due to sheer numbers. Noobs can't win a fair fight
---
Right? Imagine playing this game solely for 15 year old gear, and then getting mad when people suggest that it should be fun to play with gear as a part and not the whole of the fucking point.  Someone should tell these dudes there's an easier way to get the gear. I just ran AQ on my lvl 100 pally while the server was down for 15 minutes...
---
This isn't the "old" version.   It's the nerfed version they came out with just before TBC.
---
Yeah details and some frame add-on broke for me. Idk which frame add-on it is, because I don't use any. But it said it wasn't compatible, whatever it was :P
---
That can't be true I literally just a defended a GY 1v3 which allowed us to cap it and then we took Vandarr down total game elapsed 52 mins
---
Does skinning a bear still aggro every bears?
---
It gets you there marginally faster.
---
I have not disconnected once so far in classic.
---
Eh every class has a bunch of stuff they have to carry. I lose most of a bags worth of stuff on my rogue between poisons and reagents etc. Druid is way worse as I carry 2-3 sets of gear.
---
Nothing wrong with ‚Äúwife aggro.‚Äù Everyone complaining about it is likely single/cant appreciate the phrase because they legitimately don‚Äôt get it.
---
From what I've seen a fair bit of people *do* mean "never change the game ever". They want Classic to be a museum piece they can come back to years down the line.
---
What is deathtrolling?
---
Not until BWL
---
You are not in a raid group
---
all day AV wasnt optimal at every point in classic
---
why aren't you showing the kills, buddy?
---
Depends on the server. In vanilla fast rushes to the end were normal pretty much the entirety of AV for certain servers.
---
sweet summer child
---
It's cause all the pixel gremlin min maxxers don't like to have fun when they play video games.
---
Everything is a rush, sprint to the end so then we'll have everything and then........
---
......
---
.....?
---
Just checked it for Kirtonos. Seems like it's mostly horde, but census shows that it's pretty even. But then I looked at ONLY level 60... and it was 65% horde.
---
"I wanna freebie"
---
Take a pill
---
Hold the door
---
down voting you dark rune stealing scum!!!!!
---
Wel it doesn't just take "some" time. I just calculated it and if you're only 2 seconds away from being able to attack him, it will take you 69 seconds to catch up, and if you're 5 seconds away, it will take you 172 seconds.
---
Mostconsumable keys besides like blacksmithing keys won't fit
---
!.12 isn't early AV.  Early AV is 1.5 or 1.8.
---
Eat a wee wee BUDSKI 
---
Bro
---
Brohhh
---
At least I still have memories of the AV that took 2 hours to queue into, and a whole day to finish.
---
Yes turning in marks gives xp
---
fyi, blizz actaully had an event they released the original AV, people still did exactly this. Happened on pservers that tried to do release AV too.
---
Lol it's so funny hearing everyone bitch in chat about people defending and capping towers etc...you know, actually playing the game.
---
Very wrong. Blaumeux is horde dominated at about 60/40 but that shows a 90% alliance. Yeah no.
---
I‚Äôm honestly starting to believe this.. like if every phase/update is implemented to make people rage quit lol.
---
And this is why so many people willingly took the heat, daring to ask for older versions of AV despite the #nochanges crowd freaking out on them.
---
Source?
---
Was made [10g](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609863240985346058/654037714064244766/unknown.png) in patch 1.12.1 and we running 1.13
---
But no one really knows until someone gets exalted
---
BGs themselves don't give xp, but you can turn in BG marks for xp
---
FYI, dungeon queue system existed in vanilla. That's what the meeting stones originally did. The meeting stones currently in classic are actually wrong.
---
Have they announced what the restart was for?
---
I heard a rumor the marshals weren't buffing the bosses, which meant you didn't need to do anything but zerg the boss.  That doesn't really work when he's buffed.
---
Go into the system settings, somewhere there is an option to manually set your graphics card to "gaming"
---
Prob optimized it when their sub numbers were going through the roof and data wasn‚Äôt some free commodity like ole Bezos is making it
---
How about you stop being a whiney bitch
---
No they're not the stats on barb blade beat dalrends
---
Ultimately, you'll want at least 4pc of the PvP set for the speed bonus.  Until then, it depends on if you're carrying as full resto or 1/29/21.  Either way, you'll want a mix of high armor/+sta pieces from the tank BiS lists for the armor and stamina plus a fair amount of +int because you'll be doing a lot of form dancing.  If you're an enchanter, get you a smoking heart of the mountain, ASAP.
---
I'd shoot for
---
Bone ring helm
---
Atal'li Spaulders (ideally Eagle or Monkey, but really anything as long as it's got +sta)
---
Stone shield cloak
---
Chestplate of Tranquility
---
Ghoulskin Leggings
---
Wildheart Bracers and belt (nice amount of +int and 200 armor set bonus)
---
Slaghide Gloves (again eagle or Monkey is best)
---
Cadaverous Boots
---
Smoking Heart of the Mountain
---
Ring of protection
---
Fordrings Seal
---
PvP Trinket
---
Unyielding Maul (+22 int enchant)
---
#newclassiccontent
---
Where people have not had 10+ years to farm information and it's new for everyone!!!
---
&gt; This version of AV is not compatible with the vanilla honor system. Very very very very quickly people are going to start optimizing how they can afk/bot through AV.
---
This version is very compatible with the vanilla honor system. The vanilla honor system is a horrid garbage system, where the best way to rank up back then was to share your account with more than one person to always have your character existing in the world.
---
 The skill of someone didn't matter, just # of hours spent grinding.
---
WSG is fucking awesome...
---
I'm pretty new to this, I didn't play back in the day. Did everyone bypass bunkers then also? That seems really strange to me. It seems like a weird pve race and not a battleground.
---
It‚Äôs perfect how it is, all the people with brains can get their rep in a couple days and never queue again. Leaving all the brain dead PvP chads to do their stupid battle ground.
---
The current meta is the same meta as in 1.12.
---
Yep, its pure strategy as it is, it's more efficient and the bulk of people want the honour more than fun. It's the same trap as retail where gear is the end goal and the journey doesnt matter. As long as a rush win is an option at all that is what people will go for.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt see much bitching there anymore
---
Oh bb pls
---
Do you get to roll on the loot that drops in AV?
---
ive always had mindflay never respec away from it, but i respec to change up my shadow tree and i had to rebuy all my mindflay ranks again
---
Not entirely true. Its harder for some classes to get honor in the overworld than others. BGs level the playing field in that regard.
---
I just did three matches, won them all, but only got 1188 bonus honor each time because everyone skips all the bunkers, the general dude and shit.  They just kill the warmasters guarding the boss when they get there.
---
Three was enough, it fucking sucks.  Boring as hell.  Classic can still be a fun game but people and modern gaming mentality has ruined it.
---
I'm not saying I want 5 hour long turtle fests but this is honestly worse.  Private server mentality has ruined the game (and yes I know people didn't actually PvP much in AV back in the day but we definitely at least tried to finish all the bonus hobor objectives.)
---
r14 was never about skill.
---
The mara quest to kill princess
---
&gt; That's sad isn't it? Rank 14 will be achieved by who could sit and do AV for a longer duration of time
---
Doesn't change how R14 was achived back in the day, execpt by now, a singular person might be able to do it due to it being XR BGs, so not everyone in the AV is from the same server, so it doesn't matter if 39 of these other people are earning the same honor as you. The people to hit R14 faster, will be those spamming AVs and getting quick 5m-10m games with a match full of no one from their server the most.
---
Get a work laptop. Problem solved!
---
Yet the pspergs are half the reason its been shit so theres that
---
I‚Äôm unsubscribed atm waiting for everyone to get into BGs so I can level in peace. Pulse check on how the open world is doing with BGs out?
---
&gt; I hope to god BFA is just a filler expansion
---
BFA had way more stuff than Shadowlands seems to have
---
I was referring to the bosses not being buffed by the 4 tower guys. I'm pretty sure this is unintentional and was fixed in the rolling restarts a few hours ago.
---
Alliance won EVERY time guys. Then horde won EVERY time. SImPle
---
ATM it's less than a minute. I'm sure it'll get up to ten minutes or so in a couple weeks.
---
They literally said they hate the exalted rep grind.
---
They aren't enjoying it, they're just happy its not as painfully long.
---
After playing 5-6 more I got two that lasted 30 minutes or so, and the horde won both.  The key for horde is not straight zerging, must have small group harass alliance, if they wipe the zerg stalls out and things get crazy.  If it is a straight up PVE race, the alliance win every time, I think the meta for this will play out as people learn better strategies.
---
Yes, preach and offer your gentle hand, let him into your ancient and withered bosom, so that he might know the way.
---
Top comment has solution
---
COMING MLADY
---
Are you an Alliance main? How can you ensure that your biases don't cause you to have too much faith in the reliability of your data?
---
&gt;Have you seen dwarf females? Dummy thicc. 
---
Ftfy
---
Another day ... meh.  Oh well...
---
Prior to 1.8 you had to kill Korrak at Snowfall to get this quest finished.
---
epic off hand with bis frost or fire or shadow spell power.
---
Obviously not your first time going out of your way to be dick lmao
---
If it's any consolation, Thrash Blade isn't all that good. The proc rate is about 3.8%, and while the specifics of how that factors into your damage (because it can proc off of instant attacks like Sinister Strike) are a bit muddy, it basically just makes it a \~37DPS weapon instead of the \~35 it says in the tooltip.
---
Consider replacing it with eg. [Cho'Rush's Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18484/chorushs-blade) or [Argent Avenger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13246/argent-avenger). Personally I'm using the [Skullforge Reaver](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13361/skullforge-reaver), debuff cap be damned; its proc occurs relatively rarely, so it often doesn't even proc during a boss, and when it does the debuff has very low priority so it'll just get knocked off if it does apply (and will knock off like, Deep Wounds or something equally minuscule).
---
Or, obviously, you can get Dal'Rend's swords, to which I say: good luck.
---
IMO the bosses and their guards need a significant damage and health buff. (Reduced by taking towers as the game intends.) Played around 15 rounds today. Only one lasted over 10 minutes. Most of these "PvP battlegrounds" were won with less than 15 people having ever been killed. 
---
So lame to see two mass of 20-30 people literally pay each other no mind as they pass within spitting distance so they can rush to kill the enemy boss.
---
Guess I'll just farm for exalted and never touch it again.
---
Not really... you want int / stam / armor.  Leather healing set is closer to what he should be aiming for.
---
Psperg?
---
yeah give it a solid week boys, i got two characters who need rep rewards
---
Yes for it to work master loot needs to be on
---
It's everything we expected it to be when they told us they were using 1.12.
---
Anathema isn‚Äôt too imbalanced. At least horde puts up a damn good fight
---
It‚Äôs not fun, you don‚Äôt get shit for rep when games end, if you want a massive PVP battle just make a raid.
---
Damn you really hate parents huh.
---
no, i'm asking do they not get specific bags which typically have larger capacities?
---
Well yeah, a lot of the people playing will be folks who fucked up and didn't gear fast enough in vanilla to get into  late game content, but now they DO know what is worth doing and can go straight for it. They know what classes are most in demand and do the most damage/best tanking/best healing, so they can pick one of those and always have a group without worrying about their slot being at risk because nobody sees the value in their spec/class.
---
If you want to get some actual pvp in, wait at your general with as many people as you can. Kill the healers before they cap the base and they‚Äôll teleport back to their base. Then you‚Äôll have a nice turtle game going that will last several hours!
---
3k xp per tuen in 39 bracket
---
This is why I que with a group of hunters and we frost trap the bridge all the way to the entrance to our boss room. Lots of time wasted in that trap
---
yes,  the discussion was about what is happening in bg.
---
spijker said that bgs are putting up impressive numbers. i said that it doesnt matter since, IN BGS, the numbers are the same for everyone, so everyone scales the same in bgs. cause you, know, bgs happens in bgs.
---
so, in percentage, everyone is in exactly the same spot.
---
from the bgs with the bgs in them
---
Originally it was a masterpiece of a BG - but then everyone decided they would rather just do fast games for rep instead of actually playing it.  So, Blizzard nerfed it five times.
---
Haha, I had the same ring drop for me back in the day.
---
Wrong.  In the original version of AV it was a drop from a troll boss.
---
So why would blizzard put it in the game?
---
No, because Horde can do dungeons located in Horde territory and get to lvl 40+ this way. SFK - RFK - SM/RFD. Alliance has Gnomeregan instead. Fuck Gnomeregan.
---
It‚Äôs 1500 xp per 3
---
Why was this downvoted so hard. This comment is basically "I am excited to play so I hope it's ready soon" 
---
Like...aren't we all excited to play? Why downvote the guy
---
Meme war crime
---
So it isn‚Äôt me??
---
Is that all rumor? Because I've seen multiple people say they were unable to trade gold cross realm in BGs while trying to tip for mage food.
---
BACK IN MY DAY I FARMED ALL THOSE TUSKS ALONE... AT PRIME TIME... ON STALAGG WITHOUT LAYER HOPPING... as *Alliance*
---
too bad you can't queue with groups
---
It‚Äôs weird how no one wants to actually play the game.
---
Must be nice to have the time
---
I don't think winning gives you xp. I think you gotta kill mobs.
---
We wanted the old AV during vanilla. Like, from the moment they nerfed it to hell. Old AV was terrible for rep and rewards, but was just good fun.
---
&gt;And fuck the boomkin changes leading into legion
---
They pale in comparison to the absolute murder done to survival spec for hunters then.
---
I don‚Äôt like it.
---
Liekly only other Healbott users but it may use the same standard as Healcomm and therefore should work even though its not technically same lib. If they are using different standards, then the least popular one will likely convert eventually.
---
Definitely not for Druids - it's mail.
---
It's got a lot of Stamina so would be OK for Hunters/Shamans who have weak gear on a PvP server, but that's about it. Useless item all around and only sells because some people *still* think being purple means something.
---
With a 2h and multiple targets should I prioritize cleave over BT? And for 2h raiding is Slam good to spec in to?
---
2% on gloves, 4% on boots and 3% on the carrot
---
SUF does support Healcomm 4.0 as of a few weeks ago.
---
It hits based off AP
---
thanks dude!
---
55-60 is pretty  fast..
---
go  BRD , go lbrs , go  strat  , go scholo  gg 
---
if you have friend run  LBRS / strat scholo as soon as you can its like 70k xp  per hour  , my 2nd  warrior  did  57-60 in a day of grinding  strat / scholo  with premades
---
32 warriors. 8 shamen
---
I can't read this right now (I'm at work) but sounds like something I've been thinking about some. For instance, most Pre-raid BiS lists for hunters list the polearms from Strat, with the best one giving something like 1% crit and 56ap. But there's a polearm from DM north that has 35 Agi.
---
Now, Agi alone gives hunters +2 ap per point of agi, so the +35 agi is equal to +70ap. Also, if we estimate that \~53 agi = 1% crit, this polearm gives \~0.66% crit. Obviously the 1% crit is slightly better overall (especially with 5 talent points giving 30% additional critical strike damage).
---
Or is it? How often does a Pre-raid fully BiS geared hunter deal critical strike damage? My character is only lvl 50, but so far in my experience non-critical hits still do the vast majority of my damage done (I generally get around 10-15% crit depending on the type of mobs I am fighting). But anyway, wouldn't the additional ap actually provide more damage simply due to the majority of damage still being done without critical hits?
---
I mean, I could be wrong here, but it does puzzle me as to why this polearm is not listed as any top-3 weapons for Hunters on the pre-raid BiS lists I have seen so far.
---
&gt;They "perfected" WoD from 10million subs to 5million in a few months.
---
WoD was, get this....5 years ago. So like get with the times I guess?
---
Yeah it's a shame rogues didn't get a class hall
---
Yeah, it's really sad the opposition to *fun*. I've been rebelling a little bit by sitting on Drek and fear-bombing alliance into him when they're trying to kill the adds.
---
Need to check if you can discombobulate yourself the moment polymorph is applied with batching.
---
If you are already polymorphed, discombobulator won't do jack, though.
---
Blizz went for the worst version of AV, even when the no changes crew was saying they should use an older version.  Don't blame us
---
My hunter used to fish with his quiver...I used to think what is this weird spanking paddle I am fishing with? Then I realized it was the quiver.
---
If you want to know what is normal then ask vanilla players. Private servers are third party and not " normal" wow.
---
here is a  census i took tonight after raid from about 10:00-10:20pm server time.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/QAqFB2O](https://imgur.com/a/QAqFB2O)
---
 53.2% horde / 46.8% alliance @ lvl 60
---
Molten Core harder than LFR anything? No.
---
yes, they do - but these bags eat bag slots.
---
Amazing
---
yeah crazy. 4 runs and I'm already almost half way into neutral. 2 wins 2 losses.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is become a firefighter in a small-medium town where nothing happens and I can fuck around and be paid for it?
---
&gt; If you don't like AV, go play WSG, if you are looking for true PvP BG, with strategy and all...but I feel like most of the people complaining here know they are not good enough for WSG, so they cry about AV where you can just blend in...
---
yeah except you're kinda forced to AV because the honor is superior.
---
if only they would've released just WSG now that would've been a totally different story.
---
The royal we
---
they literally stated their reasoning for doing it. and it wasn't what you said
---
why wouldn't they have just said in the blue post that they were restricting the API to fix the chat lag if that was their reasoning?
---
they would have
---
Sometimes you didn't die when struck by a lethal attack, you instant dropped to 1 HP and became invincible. Happened to a Priest in our AV
---
Some guy on Reddit said he bought one, wore it like twice and it's falling apart, so he doesn't wear it anymore. Probs made in a sweatshop and they sell it for hundred if dollars..
---
I didn‚Äôt. I just stopped playing entirely for the time being.
---
Term is from the original Starcraft where Zerg units were weak but cheap to produce, so the strategy adopted was to simply overrun your opponent with numbers.
---
I don't recall.
---
I played a warrior. Killing blows was all that mattered.
---
More likely they just don't suck.
---
Just enable nameplates for a sec at least? Ctrl+V by default
---
and, for the record, I never said that you were wrong.  I just said that you didn't provide any proof. Which is still 100% true, even if for some weird reason you were right but Blizz declined to mention that.
---
There is a quest just outside of the town in Desolace you get from an npc standing under a tree. My questie didn't show the quest nor had she had an indication that the quest was available for me. Check on classic.wowhead.com, search for the weapon and read the comments, it told me the exact coordinates.
---
I dont get it
---
No it wasn't. Literally only ND had AV be the best honor per hour, every single other pserver you did wsg or AB except for AV weekend.
---
It was announced literally months and months ago that it would be post-nerf AV, even during the Classic beta AV stress test there were 5-10 minute long matches
---
Why is this so shocking to people when they've talked about it multiple times?
---
Ah thanks
---
Or we could all go out and ride a bike, hop in a pool, play with kittens, or get out and do productive work.
---
https://youtu.be/n4TyqYsC26g
---
This even effects unbound BoE great to. Which you will have to repair before you can AH or trade it.
---
A 40v40 player vs player fight has never taken any amount of individual skill in any video game ever.
---
&gt;Once geared up in dungeon bis and having epic mount/decent gold pile to sit on, there just isn‚Äôt the same kind of repetitive play value. 
---
This is how I feel right now. I need like 150g for my epic mount but I barely log in for raids right now. I would love some Mythic+ Scholo or Stratholme to fill in the gap.
---
What server were you on? 
---
Because if you're on an RP server it has special rules for names.
---
That's been a general rule since the beginning. No pop culture names.
---
You‚Äôre technically not supposed to name yourself after famous people. Part of TOS.
---
I would think that a good number of no-changes people were on board with 1.12 compared to having a redesign lead by the current developers. I would also wager a good number wanted no changes but from an earlier version. There are also certainly some who just wanted this version so they could get their rep and never go back. I don't think anyone was really unified about AV in particular.
---
This is the late Vanilla AV. In my first character I basically got to "Knight" just doing AV. Log on did some AV, went to work, came back got in the SAME AV. Next day we heard Alli or Horde won AV and it was either cheers or back at it for revenge! BTW there wasn't Xrealms bgs theb
---
Druid is the class that can do a shity version of everything
---
I've been seeing warriors tank in both the fury and protection tree so they can track and do DPS without having to respecc. 
---
Does anyone have a link to this build?
---
If neither appeals to you, you can continue playing classic. Just don't deny other players, that's all im saying.
---
Hats off to you Noishrol.
---
Damn I miss the original AV.   Miss my HWL razors.
---
Promised myself I wouldn't play Classic until &gt;4 hour AVs were common again.
---
One person having carrot on a stick is not valuable. Even the entire raid having it only matters if both sides don't stop. Right now the meta for one side is to give up on winning and stop halfway up the map.
---
So the only thing that would massively sway AV winrate is being persuasive enough in BG chat or lucky enough to get a group that knows how to not overcommit to objectives in the middle of the map.
---
And Scorpid Sting and Viper Sting though I don't know about Wyvern Sting. Also the green dragons (NOT dragonkin) and all elementals are immune to the three I know about above. In the same boat they're immune to rogue poisons I believe.
---
Just a bit of old school RPG flavour that just hurt more than it helped.
---
they literally did run out of time. It was supposed to have a huge battleground. attached to it, you can still see the caves where the entrance would be. Otherwise its one of the most visually stunning zones of classic, with like 5 quests. They had so much more intended for that zone.
---
Apparently the quality is really disappointing too.
---
Skill is fighting premades okay mr skill
---
It took me 5-6 hours to get each level after 55.. idk your schedule but I got from 55-60 in a week just getting 1/2 a level a night and going hard over the weekend. Also at your level I‚Äôd recommend starting your own xp farm groups for LBRS.
---
Me either, but I enjoyed the price is right clip. /Shrug
---
5 hours on the east coast
---
Wsg isn‚Äôt skill. It‚Äôs going to be premade va pugs for the most Part.
---
Just change it to Kanyay
---
On Nost (old av) people could easily prevent this. If 1-2 mages decides to turtle teh game would be much, much longer. Unless your premade has really good rogues that can chain CC them as the zerg moves past the towers with the OP archers.
---
The nerfed version of AV is a fucking joke though.
---
Our tank got the second binding for thunderfury and we were so scared he wouldn't have it after the shutdown. Luckily no rollback but all the mc trash respawned
---
there are some empty caves plastered in faction banners. Not sure where the horde one is but the alliance one is just south of the fligthpath, kinda hidden off a twisting path into some mountains.
---
yeah this won't work. I tried it for a compantion pet quest reward taht i accidently deleted and wasn't on the item restoration page. They just gave me a generic response about how that is the intended classic experience.
---
You mostly want to stack +healing as a druid.  Mp5 is not very good since fights are over so fast.  On longer fights in future raids you can put some on if you need it but in 99% of situations mana is not a problem using dark runes and mana potions. 
---
Spell crit is ok for druids but not something you really want to focus on.  Hots obviously don't get any benefit at all, and a spell criting can just end up being overhealing in a lot of cases. 
---
Pretty much any other blue healing ring is going to be better than that one.
---
/r/polyamory perhaps
---
your item was probably on the item restoration list. If it's not there, pretty sure they can't restore it.
---
If I'm 2h horde should I use hamstring over HS to dump rage?
---
wouldn't be surprising, there is a lot of interesting stuff along the coasts, and the water elementals hang out there
---
We use suicide kings and decided bis is bis. Yeah we have prio for the important stuff. Maybe this isnt relevant to onslaught cause we dont have ret pallies, but were letting the moonkin use his suicide kings spot on whatever he needs like anyone else, he shows up everytime, orange or high purple parses for his spec(which isnt a lot but hes still trying), and the combined dps we gain on our locks/mages if added to his dps would put him around 500+dps. And he helps me(the only resto druid) buff, plus innervate and battle res. Why wouldnt we reward him with equal loot opportunitys for just playing a meme spec when he brings his weight.
---
What window mod is that?
---
I'm a PvE player and my BiS  offhand til p5 is from exalted with AV, if I didn't get a reward from it I'd never touch this shit. 
---
If Australia could weaponise the toxicity from Arugal we'd have created a weapon to surpass VX...
---
a portal from 1 point to the other would be game-changing for that zone.
---
It's called lazy, and I have nothing to prove, y so serious
---
They don't even have a Classic specific twitter account.
---
how? BGs dont give exp
---
People checking for exploits in fresh content is common practice...
---
But you can‚Äôt equip/unequip gear when dead anyway?
---
Second this. There are quests to do, too, depending on the game you get in. Every win is 3300 xp and most wins have been under 10 minutes long start to finish. Plus you‚Äôre earning honor and rep. And it‚Äôs fun.
---
probably a clarity in pvp thing, knowing the racials of your enemy at a glance
---
Sitting on glorious two minute ques myself
---
I get 3300 exp for every win by turning in my marks.
---
Funky things seem to happen you pug raids. Let's say you have 35 guildies in your MC, and pug the last 5 spots. Somehow, those 5 guys seem to get the highest rolls and get all the best loot, robbing your guild of the loot that it organized the raid for. OP is comparing those puggers to the unbelievably lucky contestants in this Price is Right clip.
---
Naturally, pug members aren't really statistically favored in any way, it's just that their wins are more salient than when your guildies win, so their wins seem more frequent in your memory.
---
How did you affort a mount at 40??? Did you farm gold????????? Your social life must suck lol. I wouldnt have time for that
---
Yeah especially cross realm. I feel like nobody will care about loot etiquette since they don't directly play with them
---
Yeah you probs saw the one I saw
---
ive had these three things since i got my epic baby and i have it set to equip/unequip when i mount/dismount
---
This is the private server way
---
i haven't actually tried it yet but you used to be able to get sunscale and nightfin
---
Horde side it's a PvP wep because no +5 to weapon skill.
---
if you poop in ur dreams u poop for real!
---
Attention
---
This is a dark and terrifying future that I hope I never see come to pass.
---
neither does turtling lmao
---
This isn‚Äôt special, I‚Äôve seen him several times...from the alliance side :/
---
Now if you had summoned Ivus, THAT would be something I‚Äôd like to see...on account of I‚Äôve never been with a team that has summoned.
---
Kurinaxx was pretty damn balanced when I was on it. Haven't played on it in a couple of weeks though.
---
This sums up a lot of why this game could be better. Everyone needs to chill on the grinds and just have fun sometimes
---
fighting gear doesnt work well if you cant reach the enemy to fight
---
Absolutely 100%. As long as the healer has mana we can pull.
---
If you have 35 guildies in a raid you shouldn't need pugs at all
---
yadretsey sruoh 72 rof deyalp I
---
The same thing happened in the "real old version" that retail had. The same thing happened on private servers which also had the "real old version". The game hasn't changed, but the people who played it kept playing it on private servers, and the way they play it has. Unfortunately it seems like this is a rude awakening for people who never played private servers at all and expect Classic to be exactly like in the old days. It never will be. Not when it comes to PvE, not when it comes to world PvP, and not when it comes to battlegrounds.
---
I know, but lets say you're getting camped.  Res, get naked in like 10 seconds, then die and spirit res
---
Shit if I‚Äôm gone for a few minutes she wonders where I am. I can‚Äôt just go do things without her knowing.
---
I do not
---
A maximizing honor/rep tactic is to capture them all BUT let the enemy team zerg and win a the same time.  Your team only gets 1 token but you can be getting ~3k honor + ~500+ rep per 5 minutes while the winning team only gets ~2k honor.
---
Factually incorrect.
---
I've been able to zoom all the way to first person and slowly wall through the cluster. I only tried it a few times, but it worked pretty fast.
---
There was a guy in BC who said "brb fucking mum", to this day I wonder if it was incest or if he was complaining about his mum bothering him.
---
Yeah, but if Blizzard tried to alter AV today to fix this PvE zerg nonsense in order for the Battleground to make sense as a PvP event, people will just nerdrage and say they are destroying Classic.
---
It‚Äôs a rep farm for most
---
72 hours is pretty impressive. Guess I'm a rook.
---
Ok boomer
---
Sounds good on paper, but no tactical mastery sucks.
---
No they‚Äôre not anymore stop spreading misinformation. And yes they are doing nothing
---
I'm away from the country until next week, but once I'm back we can run the census together on different timeslots to see how the server is holding up.
---
Yes
---
I mean if you into that you could just sit there and rub one out at the same time while watching.
---
Two and a half hours of AVs only got me 2k into friendly, winrate makes a serious difference!
---
It was way earlier
---
They didn't decide to. They didn't keep version controlled source code until 1.12 and the oldest database version they had was a backup from right before TBC, 1.12. This was literally the oldest code and database they had, so they couldn't go any further back if they wanted. Then they ported it to the new client. There's a Blizzcon video on the whole thing, it's pretty cool if you're into software development.
---
I always have issues using a credit card so just go through PayPal now. Same card but no error message.
---
Making people aware of this wont help you get your quest done
---
I usually queue up certain videos to watch.
---
Hell, I remember back in vanilla the meta on Zul'jin was for Horde to never leave the cave and simply allow Alliance a win ASAP. AFK honor farming was all the rage.
---
Answered the horde survey, can't wait to see the results!
---
They did a server reset at 9pm on a Tuesday. Whoever had that idea should get a raise
---
*all. Not most. If you get kicked for Zerg rush honor farming, then all are forced to Zerg rush honor farm.
---
It's more like coming home expecting to find your cute little sister only for the dog to call you big brother.
---
Jesus, it happens on horde side, too?? That‚Äôs disappointing. That‚Äôs literally every game I‚Äôm in on alliance.
---
Why would you whirlwind two mobs for less damage and more rage when you could cleave them for more damage and less rage. It also doesn‚Äôt have a cd.
---
true, there's nothing stopping the horde from defending and pvping on a pvp server, isn't that what they like to do?
---
a valid query
---
Does it matter that I have none of the expansions aside from WotLK and BC? I'm not sure how any of that stuff works now
---
~786,000 xp required 56-60 @3,300xp/10 minutes at best = 238 turning OR ~38.6 hours playtime. This is all the very best case scenario with regards to no turtles and near instant queues. 
---
No even remotely worth it.
---
Man, I'm really sad we got rush AV from the start. The old 12 hour pitched battles were so much more interesting
---
ElvUI
---
The only people who would complain are those who will never play another AV after their rep grind.  And I really don't care what those people think.
---
Rumor is that they are used to open doors?
---
Arrow?
---
well they were so you don't think
---
Was ducking ridiculous
---
Pve server players who sorely waited for AV must be gouging their eyes out, within minutes the meta was figured out and it causes them to never enjoy pvp, not even in BGs.
---
Well I guess they can queue vs pvp server premades in WSG and face off against people who have every pvp trinket/consume/item and engineering.
---

---
BGs only live on US servers?
---
I also left quite a few high lvl toons on a PVP server for a RP server. I was new to wow, and didn't know how shitty phase two would be.  I'm super happy now and I have a lvl 47 warrior already. I highly suggest rolling on a PVE or RP server. Everyone on my server, Bloodsail bucs, Ally side is super awesome and very helpful. Your welcome to come join us. 
---
Lots of phast two refugees came over too, so there are still plenty of people leveling a, and leveling alts too.
---
&gt;Noone actually wanted this AV.
---
Speak for yourself.  This version of AV makes the rep grind so much more bearable.  I should have exalted on both of my characters by the end of this weekend.
---
Can I reasonably gain exp while doing AV? I'm lvl 57 and I feel like I'm going to miss the hype and the sub 10 min run hay days if I dont join in now, but I'm so close to 60. My guild is saying do AV to get my BiS offhand, but it's not THAT major of an upgrade over Spirit of Aquamentas.
---
I think I figured it out.  If you haven't downloaded the newest healbot from the healbot website, it's not going to communicate with other people using older standards.
---
37 dps vs 35 isn't really as straight forward a comparison when you're talking about a warrior. The extra rage gained from additional main hand hits adds a significant amount more damage.
---
Laying down on the nearest bed before logging out
---
They could have encouraged people to roll Alliance with faction-specific queues. The main problem with faction balance is that it always gets worse. Transfers (free or paid) make things worse.
---
A 65/35 server will eventually become 90/10. A medium server will become low and so on. People will flee imbalanced servers making the destination servers worse. Imagine if tens of thousands of Alliance go to Mograine and Ashbringer. Those servers could become 65/35 for Alliance and Horde may then transfer away and the cycle continues.
---
Retail has shown us that, for the most part, everyone ends in a few megaservers that are unifaction. There's almost no benefit to being in: 1) Minority faction or 2) Small server.
---
The trade thing seems reasonably fast to find out due to trading with mages for water and what not.  
---
The summon one seems... Dodgy to say the least.
---
Hopefully they add everything except for instant 60 boosts.
---
Kill me now.
---
I was expecting these long epic games of yesteryear with people upgrading the guards and stuff.
---
But all I saw was min/maxers who only care about farming honor points using a PvE method. People who would rather lose fast then play an epic game.
---
And who could blame them when there is zero incentive to play a long game. You don't get any more honor at all for winning fast or slow. It's the same amount.
---
AV can be fixed if they just increase the amount of honor gained over a long game duration and add in some other incentives to prevent both teams from racing to finish.
---
How could Blizzard play test this kind of zerg playstyle and call it good? Alterac Valley has so many cool quests and things in it and literally no incentive to actually do any of them. Zerging is absolutely the best option for honor points. Which kinda sucks because that was never what a good Alterac Valley game was.

just throw all your keys into the bank, then right click them, they'll go into the keyring.

---
The -2100 to armour well outoutweighs the 14% damage loss from glancing blows when boss armour is high enough. There's no such thing as a PvE two hander for alliance, they don't have windfury.
---
*laughs in Pursuit of Justice*
---
Playing retail way more and enjoying it entirely because of Korraks Revenge.
---
This is the way Classic AV should have been and I genuinely am only interested in AV at 60.
---
Hearing that it's the diet AV race version makes me a bit sad and I can't see myself playing much Classic since there's no glorious AV battles
---
Turtles will still happen but...retail does it better for now.
---
They forgot to open BG's in EU, classic blizz
---
You don‚Äôt get exp from BG
---
Why play the game when u can reach exalted in 3 days and not have to queue AV ever again and stick with a fun premade for WSG for the rest of eternity. People see AV as a hurdle, not a grind. If it was a grind they would make some changes and make the PvE element much harder than it is. There is no grind atm, its all just a chore to get it over with.
---
Of course, I just used those numbers to provide a clear example of the situation.
---
It's pretty useless, it's like other lvl 50 ish epics - decent but not even close to best in slot for anyone come raid time. See if you can sell for 20-30g and get on with it
---
&gt; Funny how the doomsayers keeps saying that any step towards BC or LK will inevitably lead to some downward spiral towards retail.
---
It leads to that or stagnation.
---
Nah, there were at least 6 different commons strats and counter strats even deep into TBC
---
Ohhhh, we call them (food name) rolls here in England, so like a pizza roll or an all day breakfast roll etc
---
You guys fuck us up all the time on Thunderfury all the time haha
---
Is the gear released with phase 2.5 too? Or is it locked until 3?
---
Yeah likely as healcomm has done similar with version 3 -&gt; 4.
---
as ally with 60% mount, whats the best way to slow the game down? [druid]
---
We are both learning because I always assumed hot pockets were everywhere
---
yeah guess what the troll boss spawns in the middle after 2 hours
---
Deathhhhrolll
---
Should have left Herod when they gave you the chance. I don't feel bad for you at all.
---
But you can get those lots of places why would you do that during a match?!
---
Just kept playing Xbox
---
Dude you guys almost always control BRM and DM entrances. I can never get to BRD without getting ganked by alliance PvP guilds
---
We'll both sides would raid just as much, unless there is some huge hardcore pve guild on the server on one side it would not skew the data
---
On mine it sits around 200 to 300 gold
---
What does that have to do with OP wanting things that were in vanilla to not be in classic?
---
Does anyone know if he and the ally boss drop items in this version?
---
That ain't your bf he's your Voidwalker summon.
---
I had a similar feeling. I got sick of just trying to push for 60 as hard as I could, so around 54 I decided to just try other fun shit in the game instead of just pushing levels. I'm a rogue so for me that meant trying stuff like BRD solo runs (pickpocketing and killing a couple of bosses) and respecing for pvp. I've also run the occasional dungeon looking for gear that will be decent at 60.
---
It made the game a lot more fun and I felt like I actually wanted to play the character again. 
---
I've definitely been a slower to level, but I'm enjoying it more.
---
I'm not sure what suggestions to make for a hunter, but I know there's things like running Mara or DM North that apparently hunters can solo at 60, so maybe you could do Mara pre 60 for a bit of a challenge and a way to make a bit of gold?
---
I'm rocking Mirah's and Bone Slicing Hatchet until a raid epic replaces BSH, but there was a time where Thrash was better than what I was using.  Cho'Rush's seems like an upgrade from it, and appears pretty easy to get.  I might spend the time to go grab it.
---
Yeah, I tried getting Rends, and I might need on them if I see them drop (Still need girdle, bracers, and truestrike anyway), but I'm not holding out, really.
---
Yeah. It's so sad. I was looking forward to original AV, and instead we got the most crippled, worthless version of AV that ever existed. Literally tragic.
---
Because I value truth over biases. I can't cheat or lie with my numbers. I write down what the census says.
---
My constant census show that the trends are fairly stable. I encourage anyone to run a census during a few evenings in any server and prove me wrong. I will even run the census with you in Gehennas for either side because I have no characters there.
---
Are you up to take my offer? Got to be next week though. We can do Tuesday and Wednesday at around 8 server time.
---
If anyone doesn't have the [AutoCarrot](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25304-AutoCarrot.html) addon I'd highly recommend it to automate the gear switching when you mount/dismount.
---
Same. cant see anything either...
---
Nope! Tauren Tippers-Sulfuras!
---
just under 90 mins till out in EU,
---
I have to agree, after 4 AVs this meta of just rushing the boss is just as bad as I remember, except players are a lot faster at it now. The 7 minute run is the only redeeming quality of this nonsense now.
---
That's been a problem since day one, I don't remember anyone proposing a better solution. I don't think anyone but the no-life rankers would have a problem with premade vs premade
---
Farming gold while your team farms honor and rep for you.
---
Same here I play on a gaming labtop and average around 70-80 fps. After todays update it is almost unplayable at a steady 19 fps. I updated my driver and that didn't work, I disabled all my addons and that also didn't work.
---
Going to try this in the morning. Thanks.
---
60.
---
I didn't even know you could summon these guys

---
I straight killed Asmond in BG's today , it was great to go back and watch myself do it.
---
I can confirm trading gold didn't work. It's the first thing I tried (with 5s) and it said no trading except conjured items.
---
Nvm I see now. They open bgs at 8
---
It is comical how many people think they have a chance to get r14
---
&gt;Do you still run dungeons after you‚Äôve finished every quest and got every item you need?
---
yes
---
That would be great, an add on with a kos list and maybe notes, that pops when you target such an enemy.
---
Step 1: hand of freedom
---
Step 2: watch them panic as you run straight towards them and they can‚Äôt do anything about it.
---
Step 3: t-bag
---
Not a fan of p2. 
---
You know what‚Äôs even worse?
---
How long ago was this and was it in ZF because that actually might have been me lmao
---
You could probably have a WeakAura to show when it happens?
---
Take any advice on ah with a grain of salt, each server has it's own economy and what works on one (server) might not on another.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm trying to grind to exalted and gtfo out of here. That place is complete hell
---
My guidie got kicked today for this. RIP
---
Alliance doesn't even wins.  
---
  They win the bg but horde gets 3-5 times the honor alliance gets by throwing the game.
---
It‚Äôs even harder to be melee dps. At least hunters have a good amount of range.
---
Well, many people don‚Äôt.
---
We've been zerging! I've won more than half my AV's today!
---
Group raid not are in you
---
not bad I'll try thx, but most times ally win and horde dont even bother getting to vann.
---
Kill stuff
---
So it is a surprise to you for not needing skill to rank up in classic?
---
dont even need to.
---
Just right click keys into bank, right click keys amd theyll dissapear into your keyring
---
they did not even fix the thing that you could hide inside walls in warsong  ... and  that is  obviously exploiting.. it was done in the beta   and was not fixed  what do you expect
---
Because crits with Mortal Shots are a ton of DPS. Your percentage of crits is the difference between 380 DPS and 540+ DPS in raids. It doesn‚Äôt matter that the majority of your shots don‚Äôt crit; crits are what push your DPS over the edge.
---
Besides, the BiS for Hunters is the 2H sword from King Gordok in DM North, which is 60 damage and 1% crit.
---
Is it really about the PvE for you guys? When I'm doing PvE, I do so while chatting with my friends. Unnecessarily complicated rotations can get in the way of that.
---
The depth and skill comes in PvP and no class wins it by following their PvE 1 button rotation...
---
[ewchewjean](https://www.reddit.com/user/ewchewjean/) gotta agree on the "build X to spend it on Y" being handed to almost each class. It's something I also noticed and it subjectively stops feeling interesting after a while.
---
No we wanted 1.5 av at launch then maybe it would progress to 1.12 av like it did in vanilla, exactly like it did in vanilla i.e.... no changes
---
If they truly listened to no changes we would've gotten vanilla AV.  
---
  This is the fucked up post 1.8 version.
---
Nah man, you just haven't learned of the good strats yet!
---
It‚Äôs just whack that ppl who barely PvP and aren‚Äôt competitive will get tons more honor than ppl who are fighting in premade wsg to farm honor
---
Except the solution of giving us old AV, is part of vanilla, whereas a modification of the honor system would not be. 
---
Also, trying to get 39 other players to do anything but play the most efficient way is futile. And really, you'd have to convince 79 other people to play a different way, 40 of which you can't communicate with.
---
At least 300 per av, which at 7 minutes is totally fine
---
A scrub says what?
---
Underrated comment kek
---
Kanye is an actual name though.  This is the rough equivalent of banning someone named Taylor because of Taylor Swift.
---
Premades dodging other premades is insane skill
---
I agree, I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck what the PVP chads think. Just wanna get the rep done ASAP for my BiS offhand.
---
You can buy a ram from the alterac valley quartermaster when exalted and it's only 640g
---
Jokes on them, my CPU does not have integrated graphics,
---
&gt;source: dude trust me
---
The problem is if you stop to kill Galv/balinda the whole group falls apart and you only get 20 ppl to drek/vann, then if the enemy faction wipes the game is now a turtle. Horde always wants to kill Bal because Alliance has the quickest path but most the time Alliance wipes and then turtles.
---
The best games I had on pservers were the ones where Horde actually defended their base. The games turned into 1-2 hour ones instead of 15   min zergs.
---
Holy shit downvotes, dudes here gotta have some sour lives to live :O
---
It's hilarious that before release everyone was talking about how they missed the community of WoW because it seems most of the people left still playing this game are toxic AF.
---
Good.
---
Yeah but that's how AV has always been, it's been THE way to farm honor, even on retail that's how it is, spam the hell outta AV for the best amount of honor, if you really want AV to be a PVP duke it out kind of BG talk the raid into turtling
---
Or make your own turtling group and use the addon to queue as a raid and just turtle.
---
Then you just have to level weapon skill
---
Here‚Äôs the top 3 fury dps 2 hand weapons (all orcs) spamstring build and their current top dps on Golemag with no world buffs and no flasks (just elixirs and roids):
---
1) SR at 650
---
2) BRE at 635
---
3) OEB at 620
---
1 and 2 have almost the same gear. 3 is missing an MC ranged wep and bracers. It‚Äôs pretty close now, but BRE should overtake SR on bosses with high armor in the future.
---
BRE is also the best for pvp until MoM in p6. Enjoy, you hit the jackpot.
---
This is great, now I don't even have to respec each week
---
When i met my wife and we decided  to be together it was not my first long term relationship, I'd been married twice before.  I know exactly how much I game and I was honest with her from the beginning and prepared to take a pass if she wasn't ok with it.  She agreed that it was fine and also games with me whenever she can.  These days she's a doctor and I get to play 8 hours a day when I'm working and 14 hours a day when I'm  not. We still spendquality time together, in fact it's easier to really make it count because she's not home from work all that often. We share all of the house work and I manage to play many many hours of Classic WoW or whatever I like every day.  
---
TLDR: know how much you want to game, engineer your life around it and be honest. Be prepared to let that lady go if she's not the right fit.
---
I think everyones agree that mages are OP in vanilla.
---
You fail to mention that there are ways to break the cc/slow, plus mages are very weak in terms of armour/hp.
---
They are indeed pretty handy to have and they are strong for PvP but they have their flaws, just like everyone else.
---
Sure would be a shame if you actually enjoyed an aspect of this game instead of just using it as a means to an end
---
let the rage flow, then apathy kicks in
---
Yeah I get it. I. Haven‚Äôt done AV since vanilla so guess I forgot. Just prefer wsg/ab and they‚Äôre considerably harder to coordinate feel like it should be rewarded in scale
---
It's not even "pvp chads". 
---
The "pvp chads" like this version because it's quick honor (but messes with the system) but most of them will be in WSG premades.
---
AV being long just had more fun to it, it was the BG for casuals.
---
nope, either or.
---
He truly was the Hemingway of our times
---
Should 1h fury warriors be considered for Core Hound Tooth?  
---
Also, does weapon speed being normalized have anything to do with offhand rage generation and flurry procs?
---
What are these keywords wrf
---
guess enemies finish faster than u get to mid
---
Pro tip send 5 people to galv
---
Too complicated group still splits up.
---
Sure would hate to enjoy the thing you're voluntarily spending time on
---
This defeats any purpose of pvp grinding to be honest. You can lose  AV in 6 minutes and get more honor for the time spent than queing for WSG and winning. It defeats any kind of honor grind because you can get more honor solo queuing av. Makes pvp groups and guilds almost irrelevant
---
We have similar things, just not called hot pockets. That sounds like something you'd buy in an adult shop.
---
3 min av, 15-20 min wsg
---
Bullshit
---
Imagine acting like anyone actually enjoys av
---
We did Ony first and rolled into MC right as server was restarting. Planned it really well, but server crashed multiple times due to the amount of people in MC.
---
Eh. I just log in to raid.
---
That's our guild master lol

Balsamic sock thing

---
But it will hurt my game experience. I like the fact that you are rewarded to run a better specc for your purpose if you cough up those gold for a respecc and as mentioned before, I think it's an important gold sink to keep the economy in check. So yes, if we'd have dual specc my game experience would be worse than it is now.
---
wow, BGs barely out and folk crying and moaning already?!?! why do some folk play this game if they hate it so much??!?!
---
Dk what to tell you about getting exalted cuz i have never done it but the lobotomizer is a good dagger to get if you are not raiding or havent gotten a gutgore ripper yet. If you see yourself getting gutgore in the next raid or something then dont buy the dagger cuz it costs like 125 gold and gutgore is a better upgrade due to its higher dmg that is needed for your backstabs and its proc its pretty good.
---
God I love these. So well done. Stuff like these always makes me want a updated graphics WoW. Like how Heroes of Storm looks with their character models.
---
"Throwing the game" means to forfeit by not trying. I'm not sure how you consider that the same as winning.
---
Haha! I, too, love causing misery in other human beings.
---
Are you Horde on Herod? Because i had some healer with that exact excuse a month ago or so.
---
Its a damn game. Quit if you can't handle the massive influx of everyone regardless of skill in day 1 of BG release. Go take some prozac and chill.
---
Yeah, good job Blizzard dealing with the queues.
---
You realize that alliance only competes with other alliance for honor points, and horde with other horde, so it literally doesn't matter to alliance that horde gets that many more times honor.
---
It probably required certain conditions.  Just cause it didn't happen to you doesn't mean it didn't happen at all.
---
TIL High Warlord is a pve title :(
---
My server at least has been up for at least an hour as of writing this BUT I tried to enter AV but it isn't enabled!
---
&gt;[Told you so](https://classic.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=384542&amp;region=us)
---
hah? that doesn't prove that hoborspy caused the chat to crash that ONE time.. if anything I think it's already been proven that the chat lag wasn't caused by honorspy since its never happened again even though people were still using it?
---
Make hour(s) long AV matches? No TY.
---
Haha get rekt nerd
---
You break the cc with your pvp trinket? WHOOPS IM JUST GONNA POLY AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 40 FUCKING SECONDS!
---
Yea thats the easy answer :) I want to do it on my rogue.. why, cos she is there.
---
AV rep has always been stupid easy to grind. In fact, in WotLk (or Cata) you could use faction tabards to grind out racial rep in AV just as easily, even when you aren't intentionally zerging.
---
Why do you think people suggest Classic+?
---
Except you tucked your tail and logged off for a while just to avoid admitting being proven illiterate. Have fun being in denial, queues so far are less than 1 min for the horde part which actually shows the balanced population taking part in bgs.
---
Coffee key is consumable. And it stacks. It's not a key from technical implementation perspective.

cool thank you. I should have specified, not so much to farm her, simply to kill her, kind of a challenge thats all.
---
If you‚Äôre not helping getting drek down you‚Äôre being useless and might as well be afking
---
Happened to me and I came here first looking for the solution, thanks.
---
Oh yeah I was only talking about actual grind. Not pvp for the sake of it.

Of course it has. Have you ever played battlefield? Or any other large-scale FPS? You can have one guy mowing down a dozen people from the other team if you're in the right position.

---
same reason people push for anything, cos its a challenge.
---
Yeah this is literally the only argument I head about it.. spoilers, *way* less people than you think are dropping lots of gold in to respecs. Most that do, go and farm for the gold in the first place in order to do it.
---
So what magical gold is being sunk in to these respecs exactly..? And you haven't actually outlined anything about your game that would be worse.
---
It wasn't dirty until you made it dirty!
---
They quit enforcing that years ago. Same with the rule of having no alternative characters in your name.
---
Warlock players that can‚Äôt handle the fact that their class isn‚Äôt as good as they remember at Classic, so instead of proving me wrong they prefer to downvote the comment.
---
Thanks for your answer, most appreciated.
---
Vancleef did nothing wrong
---
Same here man I haven't touched OSRS since classic launched.
---
Oh look, it‚Äôs the post complaining about people complaining.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm at the same played time and halfway through honored but we‚Äôre winning every game only lost like 1
---
This is the exact issue with the new av style . No incentive to run premades or group for actual PvP focused BGs now
---
I'm not new to wow, i'm a vet from original.   I just didn't think the camping would be this bad
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why either of these names need to be hashtagged. 
---
Is this maintenance message supposed to take off on Twitter or something?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna level an entire new char when I don‚Äôt even have my main at 60
---
The true classic experience.
---
There are ways to close the distance fast, interrupt and so on.
---
Take a chill pill, mate.
---
Second shift, borderline random days scheduled. Always have at least one day off during the week.
---
It‚Äôs whack. And between the two sides, ones gonna rush and what should feel like the most epic experiences are lost on people that just want this game to be a gear pi√±ata. If that‚Äôs what you want, fine, but it ruins it for folks that had a blast with proper AV back in the day. 
---
The other side is: you don‚Äôt like AV, don‚Äôt play or do the rep grind with quests objectives etc. but there‚Äôs no option right now, nor will there likely be one, to enjoy what was a major positive experience for a lot of folks. But the death squads, those were legit...
---
Nina!!  üò¢  Still too soon...
---
Then don't play it.  You have two other bgs to play, why do you think you have  the right to ruin a part of vanilla that so many people want - when it really doesn't hurt you? Or is your absolute favorite thing in vanilla speed killing the av boss? That's what you plan on doing every free second even if there's no rewards?
---
Go tweet the Blizzard CMs on twitter about it as they will look into it and possibly undo it for you.
---
But yeah that's dumb. They should check into it. Its a little tiresome when we keep seeing GMs fair to enforce the rules correctly. Or give some favortism. 
---
One guy on my server transferred to a latin realm a month ago because he was blacklisted from all guilds here. But he didn't speak anything but English so it didnt work out. He kept opening tickets demanding a re-transfer, and they told him no every time. Well apparently 7 times is the key, because the 7th GM did it for him.
---
God damn horde
---
You're alliance, so of course you would say that
---
Bout to drop that lit album.
---
That‚Äôs not how it has always been.. Well In vanilla at least .AV was always good for solo queing.. but an organized group doing wsg and ab would always get more honor.  AV was primarily used for bgs to run in between ques since they lasted so long and could hop in between a fight  and hop out when you were able to join another battleground
---
Nah it puts winning the game in the hands of the alliance and they wipe half the time and then the game is a 30min turtle.
---
&gt; should have their character turned into a gnome mage for a month.
---
Gnome paladin.
---
It'ss removed
---
I'm horde not sure if its a biased experience but people keep saying horde are the real winners of the alliance burning down drek. I personally dont see how its a competition we dont compete vs the other faction for honor.
---
Does retail have infinite content?
---
&gt; Also, what makes you think everyone prefers classic+ to bc or wotlk?
---
I don't think such a thing. I think *some* people prefer Classic+.
---
Well there‚Äôs a common thread here and it‚Äôs min-maxers abusing the game systems rather than embracing them.
---
This. Huntards driving me crazy in WSG
---
Gold trading didn't work. I tried to tip in my first av game at 1240pm pst
---
What I also would love to see is revisiting old zones. They tried a little bit in BfA by adding some PvP dailies to old zones but I would love to see more happening in world. I want it to feel alive. It's absurd that after all these years some areas are just like they were at launch.
---
But it's a ram
---
You have the quicker option of deserter, so why stay just to cry?
---
leech from people killing people. OR moonfire everything and hope for the best.
---
Yo these are dope. I‚Äôm not sure if you want these to be solo projects, but I‚Äôm a fellow 3D Artist. Mainly use C4D and Redshift render engine. 
---
Followed you on Instagram, hit me up if you ever need a helping hand :D
---
This is me in every game
---
Keep in mind people usually have spreadsheets to know the top damage of each item. Don't go by websites though. Check your class's discord out. It's by far the best resource for pure information. Like for my class, Fight Club is a godsend. It's like Elitist Jerks of old but for warriors. The hunter's have a similar discord too, I would say check into it. I know this doesn't answer your question but I wanted to bring up how bad many of these lists are. Like that god awful classicbis website has/had it set that Dal'Rends was hunters Pre-Raid BIS weapons and they simply are not.
---
Work in progress! On Majordomo, but we wiped twice cuz our sheeped targets cuz dotted from a enh shammy.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12969/seeping-willow
---
I enjoy plenty of aspects of the game.  PvP isnt one of them.  If I want to pvp go play some counter strike or FIFA.
---
I can't even get the intro trinket quest done because these AVs end so fast =/
---
Yes, everyone please level a mage. Especially Horde on Bloodfang-EU. My kitty druid needs more food.
---
because Hord kill the alliance commander and LTs for rep and honor while alliance just zerg derk so in the end horde get more honor for the kills then alliance do for the win
---
Getting discord and counting down is hard
---
Nah humans have the rep thing, remember?
---
We didn't think we did, nochanges overruled all anyway, but now we blame Blizz
---
The cycle is complete
---
&gt;There are ways to close the distance fast, interrupt and so on
---
Mage just blinks away.
---
Was it really worth getting 3 capped
---
Overworked seems real real chill now on Kromcrush...
---
Questing again after being unable to move and didn‚Äôt die once. Glad I didn‚Äôt opt for the PvE route now. I got close.
---
FAP doesn't prevent poly.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, you only compete against your own faction for honor. Alliance should win 100% of the time especially if horde is killing bal.
---
Asking for progressive itemization is the dumbest fucking idea I can possibly imagine. Yes, lets make it so that with the perfect knowledge of what's coming we force everyone to collect hundreds of items and gear that are terrible for them to use right now, but will become usable later. People will surely love having like 8 sets of gear to future proof themselves.
---
We should also perfectly replicate every mistake that was made in the game, allowing not only exploits but also punishing players by forcing them to play gimped versions of classes that we know were broken and later reworked.
---
Doesn't work, bud.
---
Please dont do this, just zerg drek and get your 6 minute wins for the good of everyone else
---
Here I'll say how it really is being someone who actually used to watch asmongold. Asmon and his followers have nothing better to do than joke around in a fun virtual environment where they thrive because there are no substantial consequences for taking a joke to far. Therefore he and his following thrive in pushing social and cultural boundaries to breaking point. They're all joking all the time, all of them are trolls 24/7 7 days a week. Inevitably as this boundary is pushed onlookers (having never seen  a social movement like this) think that many of the participants are serious.
---
 Their actions are creating some negative consequences(even though it's a video game) so it is my prerogative to stand up against these horrible people and preach about their wrongdoings on Reddit. they all walk and talk like extremists so they must be extremists. This will have real impacts on a huge number of people irl. - no it's not. You really just have no idea. Stop trying to police the internet.
---
It was fun for ranged classes maybe but 40v40 is cancer for melee
---
How the fuck
---
8 hour AV's were never fun lol

Here ya go! Fury/Prot is actually really great for raid tanking. For 5 man dungeons its definitely worse (though still doable!). The gearing is a bit different as you definitely want to be hit capped and each bit of gear is definitely noticeable. The main reason to go this is if your raids DPS is having to hold back from fear of pulling threat on bosses in raids. If your DPS is that good then go with this spec as it lets you build your threat much faster.
---
NO CHANGES
---
It‚Äôs cause they kill Balinda
---
&gt;Does retail have infinite content?
---
Retail has content some people prefer, as with BC, wotlk.
---
&gt;I don't think such a thing. I think some people prefer Classic+.
---
And you have have both classic+ and BC/wotlk. I'm not saying classic+ should never be a thing.
---
*World PvP is going to be great, best thing ever!*
---
P2 launches
---
*World PvP broken this game sucks. I hope BGs out soon*
---
AV launches
---
*This AV sucks...*
---
I see kinda pattern here.
---
I hate when your right! Those five levels are a millennium compared to a mage leveling experience
---
but what benefits do alliance get for zerging derk?
---
why cant they kill the commanders / LTs for reps / honors?
---
or is this a general agreement to make games as fast / efficient as possible for both sides?
---
Well, i 1shot mages on my ele shaman. Every 3 minutes... Its like, who gets the first shot off wins. Like a real duel!
---
Meanwhile its nearly impossible to lose to a mage as a druid.
---
NO CHANGES REMEMBER
---
On my Rogue i have 2 spells that both get rid of fear so what i had to do to bind them to 1 key is something along the lines. 
---
/Castsequence reset=120 Will of the forsaken, Trinket of the horde.
---
What that does is cast will of the forsaken on first click then the trinket on the second click, and then waits 120 secs for the cooldowns to go away before being able to click again. Is that something that might work for you?
---
my favourite is when both teams fuck up at rushing the boss and then some idiot just spends the rest of the match crying about how bad everyone is because we didn't all forfeit so he could requeue into a different instance. Nothing's worse than people who think they're elite but aren't actually
---
Reads like my grandfather trying to use a GPS..
---
So far so good. I finally got a bunch of quests done in the EPL and WPL! Managed to land at Chillwind Camp and no immediately get murdered by 6 people.
---
IM MAD AS FUCK AND YES IN DOGSHIT. I know deep down
---
Imagine doing anything but PvE in AV.
---
How much Honor the other faction get is irrelevant.

What are EP values and how did you decide on those numbers
---
its just people in general just wanting to zerg to be as efficient as they can if Blizzard would of left the buff from the towers in the game it would be much much different
---
QQ fake news grow up
---
Back in TBC people werent min/maxing. Now it is more efficient to end AV quickly and get into a new one in order to get honour.
---
If you have the hit or edgemasters then yeah, I would say so.
---
Finally, dome peace and quiet
---
Waiting for the post from the guy who had the most honor for the week but didn‚Äôt rank because he didn‚Äôt get his 15 kills because he spent too much time in AV

Twinks can be like that, my suggestion is to find others to queue with since solo q can be a literal nightmare. You can also set different goals for yourself besides winning to make sure it stays enjoyable, since nobody wins every time. If you lose the match but learned a new jump or majorly outplay someone of the same class for example, you still gained something from the match. Learn to have fun no matter what the situation is. I‚Äôll add one more thing; you are going to do 100s if not 1000s of bgs on this toon. It‚Äôs Very possible to have an unlucky day and lose 10 games in a row, I wouldn‚Äôt give up just yet, you could end up winning every game tomorrow.
---
Isn't the "battle group" the entire Region?
---
Dynamic flock wing
---
There are engineering shenanigans, such as grenades, pretty handy for PvP.
---
Maybe duel some mage friends? Practice makes perfect.
---
Please make a post for every player you kill, treat this like your personal blog.
---
Casuals should try retail. No one who is half decent at the game enjoys AV. Least of all the day long stalemates that we loved as 10 year olds.
---
In my experience huntards haven‚Äôt really been an issue. But who gives a shot complain all you want.
---
its the honor dude. if you want to rank you have to get more honor than the others, and you cant do that without 10minute av games all day now
---
This is 1.12 AV, blizzard specifically said all content will be 1.12, this is no surprised considering we got nerfed MC.
---
This isn‚Äôt really proof of anything. Just that Blizzard had their games available at different times.
---
No it wasn't but it happened because it wasn't mathed to shit for 14  years
---
1.12 is possibly the worst patch to run Classic off. It was literally thrown together at the last minute to prepare the game for TBC and to get more people into raids. It's the "eh, next expansion soon, may as well enable tourist mode" patch. You are seeing the direct consequence of not going with a more progressive patch-by-patch approach.
---
wait, that's why nobody kills tower?  
---
The General buff isn't active!??
---
They're both the classic experience. The beauty is that with the shared subscription you can actually experience both versions right now as long as you have a 60+ character in both versions of the game.
---
It‚Äôs technically 8% miss with a 1% additional penalty for more than 10 difference between weapon skill  and the targets defense (315 for bosses). Having at least 305 weapon skill grants 2% hit and removes the penalty, effectively granting 3% hit.
---
Vanish does. Prep+cold blood spec is probably the easiest way to handle a mage. Spider belt is an awesome item aswell. Dont know much about other matchups tho :D
---
Same shit happening horde side
---
Hey I've been playing with my filter on and loving it, but today's update seems to have broken it! Now it says "a supported game is required to use this feature". Have you had any luck getting it to work? I know they changed the name of the game's executable from Wow.exe to WowClassic.exe and that broke my Steam configuration for a sec...
---
This. Instead of whining about the meta, be the difference. Go defend, pvp you‚Äôll get a higher win chance and have fun doing that
---
Well thanks for your input everyone. Quick update: lost 2 more since my initial post -- in the meantime another player called me an idiot for "running into horde base for no reason" (TIL going after the efc apparently does not qualify as a reason)
---
I am not a good player by any means, hence my desire to twink. I have no delusions about my skill or lack thereof. But I stand by what I said:  I'm bad; nearly everyone else is plain clueless.
---
I thought this entire game was about going back to WoW's glory days? Even if like 2% of the population actually enjoyed AV in its original stage, that's 2% more than for the current version.
---
can't put coffer keys in keyring in vanilla or classic #NoChanges
---
It feels more like 44/55 horde favored. I love world pvp on here as a alliance.
---
Are there any confirmed rations?
---
but that would have required actually paying people to implement properly. this is so much easier for the devs.
---
What does any of that have to do with you getting rekt in the 39 bracket wsg? Keep pulling stuff outta your ass, it‚Äôs serving you well so far.
---
The people who usually say 8 hours is too long are almost always the people who 8 or more hours a day. If you work that much with a wife and/or family, 8 hours a day is to the point of either severe sleep deprivation or neglecting your partner.
---
If you don't work that many hours it's fine I guess.
---
Why does it matter if Horde gets more honor?
---
Solo it'll be tough.  Just keep heading there at the start and see if anyone else is heading that way.  2 or 3 people should be able to get in before the game is over.
---
From all the complaint threads about wpvp, it sounds like most Alliance players have 12 kids, 4 wives, and only 30 minutes to play a day, so it will probably take them a week or two to get their rep finished.
---
You land lubbers are tougher than I thought.
---
Yes we did. All the private servers did older version of AV.
---
If you‚Äôre rage capped and everything is on cd with a Hs queued you should spam sunder. It‚Äôa a high threat, no cd ability.
---
How about instead they added the entire non nerfed game?
---
you are right. Acually im leveling a mage alt just for aoe griding so i guess that should be enough
---
Cause it goes for 6 hours instead of 6 minutes.
---
It sounds like you need a hug.
---
Thats prenerf where AV fights would take hours or days :x
---
Appreciate it. Thanks for that.
---
But is this the 1.12 version of AV? You aren't being clear.
---
I think we get access tomorrow at 0pm
---
Its probably coming when the honor resets in like an hour.
---
Is this all this sub has come to? Constant, annoying circlejerking? 
---
Zeppelin masters literally yell out where the Zeppelin goes when it arrives at the tower. There are guards everywhere that you can ask for help. And I don't believe you when you say that everyone was roasting you for asking a question.
---
Why do you feel the need to write what is essentially a fallacy statement? People are venting their frustrations that the game is now PvE again.
---
I got more honor today in AV than I got the entirety of last week. And I was 99 standing. Nobody ranking up is doing world pvp anymore
---
Lapdogs, all of you!
---
Go try Korrak's Revenge AV on Retail.  It's what AV should have been for Classic.
---
then find a premade?
---
Insert Wonder Women gif of her running towards a baby
---
Each hit will consume a charge of sweeping strikes, so if you WW two targets then it will use two charges of sweeping strikes.
---
So its pointless?
---
The issue is the faster way to rank up in pvp is not doing pvp....
---
Because he would need top tier people around him who do the same :x
---
Sometimes my Nvidia cards do this. 30fps bug. I alt tab and alt tab back and than its back to normal fps
---
i dont get it either not really explained
---
World pvp is a waste of time now. You can get more honor in a day in AV than an entire week of world pvp. Unless you like killing people out in the world, go over server
---
Check and make sure that it's your gpu being used and not your integrated graphics. Some people are saying that it was switched with this patch.
---
They still enforce it, here's the official article, updated 4 weeks ago
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764
---
My friend got forced rename for having a "Willferal" on an RP server haha
---
so freaking epic my dude. epic win
---
You think it's logical to play games for fun and don't care about your problems.
---
‚ÄúMy wife just came home and my gf is still here. Wish me luck‚Äù the screenshot is on here somewhere
---
Don't get me wrong I have plenty of gripes with it too. But it's so polished now and the Bfa story is genuinley interesting, I'm still questing after hitting max and it's not for some hidden reward.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the anniversary event in retail it‚Äôs still not even the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù AV. It‚Äôs like a mash up of old and new just touted as the original experience.
---
Well I enjoy AV. Guess I'm not half decent man, feelsbad. Thank you for pointing out how bad I am, would have never known without you. /s
---
thats how it goes
---
Classic made me appericate BFA for what is was and I enjoy both of em
---
I only need a better Classic.
---
If this was a private server, it would be abandoned by now. That's how bad the state of things is.
---
Yay! Flamelash is saved!
---
Mods were just as popular back then.
---
It is
---
worked immediately! thank you so much.
---
dunno how i could have missed this. guess auto detect in advanced system settings within wow was going straight to integrated like you said.
---
appreciate the help!
---
you are me! Thats exacly what I do on raid nights! :D works 99% of time
---
A weapon to surpass Metal Gear..
---
Yes you did what? Want 1.12?
---
I guess I'm just nostalgic for the orginal AV. It was a different time, people wanted to win. They didn't just roll over for the other team because it was more efficient, they fought hard, fought for their faction. It was so much fun!
---
use it
---
Where is mr smite?!
---
Great work though, really detailed!
---
xD you noticed
---
lmao I can't believe people fall for this
---
It's possible it's more for the quest, yea.
---
Had this happen on strat ud. Shady hunter insisted we did crossbow guy first. So I knew what was gonna happen and as tank I set the pace and saved that for last. Thinking back. Should of just replaced him so we didn't have to find someone for Baron, but he got a little benefit of a doubt
---
It does. When vann spins with the buffs, tanks and melee dps will die.
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt think it was too bad but you‚Äôre right smaller scaling looks cleaner
---
It's the best honor too. Feels bad.
---
&gt;Its ok forcing women is a-ok in my culture
---
Your culture is garbage.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs Mythic+ raiding for masochists trying to get some Uber specific piece of gear that‚Äôs warforged and titanforged and penisforged and assblasted and all that whatnot, but is it really worth it when shadowlands will just make those useless anyways?
---
Yes? That's like...the entire purpose of the game? To get gear? Do you not do MC because Naxx gear will be better?
---
Here we go, people crying about other people crying has started...
---
19 paid time off days in the entire year? That's 9 days under the legal minimum in my country... america I'm guessing?
---
Being horde is just that good
---
Just WSG. You are fucking over your whole team.
---
that's what being grossly overpowered gets you
---
It's more about taking the path of least resistance. It's just the most efficient way to grind honor.
---
If only we got the original version of AV :(
---
feels like my fps got better.
---
well i'm not surprised at all at the retail scum turning this into a 'max honor' race...  
---
Has any horde actually grouped to turn AV into an actual fight?
---
  &gt;complains about 6 min AV with no HKs
---
  &gt;also standing in drek's room over his dead body
---
lmao
---
this has aged well
---
Fuck you.
---
-horde on heartseeker
---
Maybe it is because Horde has PvP oriented racials like WotF, melee burst and mass stun while Humans do not got EMFH yet, so best Alliance racial is gnomish, for melee classes, dwarven for anti rogue. NE and Human racials do not help if combat has been initiated.
---
He does apparently.
---
  
---
And I agree, it looks like shit.
---
You get more honour from NPC kills and the Horde boss is closer to the Alliance spawn.
---
As a PVP player I would prefer it if raids could be cleared in 5 minutes without any fighting at all just walk in and pick up the loot thanks, dont really see how that would be a problem
---
Can confirm, your mom is my fat wife.
---
Your monarchy that was completely run by un- elected bureaucrats at the time , stiff you on payment for a job that was for the well being of the people - of course you are going to form a militia to fight the dictatorial powers at be.
---
.. where it was burned down in the legendary quest line though.
---
Same boat. Never played on a PvP realm since WoW exist, wanted to try. Nope! not my cup of tea.
---
Yeah you guys said the same thing about leveling up then started crying when 60's came through your 50 zone and started wrecking you while questing.
---
At this point I don't see how anyone can fly the Olympus colors. How embarrassing it must be to know that you are one of the most destructive forces arrayed against the success of Classic WoW and its legit players.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1110514-frame-rates/
---
Meh just be single, do whatever the fuck you want and do whomever you want as well.
---
Horde doesn‚Äôt win more often, alliance zergs the boss while horde farm npcs for honour.
---
Thanks. I guess I've just been preparing for bgs to drop for so long, losing them all felt like a slap to the face
---
Maraudon scepter doesn't count as a ring, right?
---
It is quite funny though. I am sort of laughing at the #nochange mentality, as what we needed wasnt #nochanges but fixing the actual problems blizzard introduced themselves.
---
Pretty sure this is details, unless I‚Äôm misremembering, something similar happened during the first couple weeks of live with it with it saying ‚Äúso and so is out of range‚Äù or something along those lines
---
I mean. Everyone knew what classes were going to be OP. It's not like back in the days of release when nobody knew what classes were OP and which were unfinished/trash.
---
And thus, 15years late, they finally understood why wow has always been a pve game.
---
It really doesn't matter which team gets more honor though since you don't compete with the other faction for rank.  So to rank as alliance you try to turn wins as quick as possible.  
---
Since horde can't win the zerg, they try to kill all the NPCs they can for honor before it ends to stay competitive in their faction.
---
Because classic is all about min/maxing. Why would anyone bother with an inferior and more inefficient version?
---
This is the dumbest thing I've read today.  Congrats and may God have mercy on your soul
---
Retail living rent free in classic players heads.
---
I assume this is America? Because I live in Europe and here, if you ever get sick, the first 3 days the company you're working for is gonna *excuse* you, then if your sickness extends, you just go to the doctor and get free. Recomended is to always go to the doctor first. Other than that, where I live, we get 6 weeks per year vacation.
---
...so? Honor/h is great
---
Nah, the version that wasn't shit would have made people happy
---
Because people largely have no idea how the pvp system in classic works.
---
Inverse for horde...i can't convince them to try to win for anything.  Everyone cares about honor more than rep...ffs, is winning such a crime?
---
People just want something to complain about, that's all.
---
He's lying.
---
If there's no such thing as PvE two hander for alliance then doesn't that make BRE a PvP drop for them? :p
---
Horde side, my guild is made up of a ton of private server vets who have cleared every raid hundreds of times, it makes no sense to give BRE to someone who doesn't PvP regularly because MC/BWL are going to get cleared at about the same pace regardless. BRE goes to someone who is willing to no-life premades and carry the team to get rank gear.
---
I think you and the likeminded people will be reported as afk and get kicked more often than not
---
Alliance won but horde got double honor?
---
Apparently the mount is 10g at exalted
---
This comment is as stupid as it is willingly ignorant
---
That's how you get rid of retail players
---
She definitely gets fucked by them though. Who knew such a large woman would be so into gnomes.
---
I‚Äôll have to improvise
---
Says who, when
---
Love it!
---
People still zerged on private servers but even the best premades had to do two towers so it took a bit longer. And pugs wouldn't do it as easy as they are now since there were elites and mines.
---
rank 13 to 14 takes a minimum of 7 weeks (with every week haveing a standing of 1)  iirc
---
Just defend, that's PvP.
---
Anduin is not exactly elected either.
---
The OP didn't specifically ask a question, but required the person reading it to come to their own conclusion, hence the Socrates method.
---
Which Marshall's?  If you happen to remember.
---
Not only did server shutdown on us our server got trolled by someone dropping ony head 20 mins before 6-7 guilds were going to raid and had agreed to drop time for the buff.
---
‚ÄúHurr durr I‚Äôm not gonna do a single seconds worth of research on anything, but I‚Äôm right and you‚Äôre wrong and I‚Äôm gonna plug my ears if you say otherwise‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre proud of this mentality?
---
 Not going to lie during the rush of leveling we were in the heart of monsoon season here in Tucson. The power got knocked out the third night I think after launch. I was on my laptop so I kept going and the router and modem were plugged into a battery back up.  From the time I mentioned the power shut off until the battery ran out I managed a couple levels. Power came back about three hours after that and then after a four hour queue I found out the person I was leveling with left me in the dust.
---
Heh this is basically me, except 4 days a week.
---
And we hardly got progressive items.
---
Disabled details and still getting it
---
Oh yeah I knew on RP servers they were stricter about it but I don‚Äôt think they do on regular anymore. That article appears to be RP specific. Nice name though lmao. 
---
I remember I first learned of this rule when a guy in my guild in March 2005ish had his name changed from Countnighty to Nightymared or something similar. Basically having Count in his name was considered a title. And this was on a regular pvp server too. The guild even got its name changed eventually too because it was &lt;Kirin Tor&gt; and that was a Blizzard thing.
---
In the old RPB books they depicted both sides as unreasonable. With the nobles not wanting to pay and the stone masons demanding completely over the top payments in the order of several million pieces of gold.
---
Wow that really sucks. At least in the retail anniversary event you have to cap the bunkers/towers.
---
Virgin obviously
---
Odds are because you‚Äôre horse, and the faction imbalance means instance queues for Alliance while horde have to wait
---
Thank you for the constructive answer.
---
You forgot the part where they call ppl who average 3/h a day casual.
---
They literally choose to play a version of the game thats 15 years old. retail with all its content is still available. Then they complain that there is no content when they got bis gear after a month of release after playing 24/7 as efficiently as possible.
---
Its ok if they want to speedrun or have a new challenge, but pls stfu about no content. I sit on 8 days /played and im not even 60 yet, far away from bis. Maybe most of those tryhard minmaxers should find a life or a game where skill is more important than time.
---
The cool thing about classic is all the interaction you can have with players, sitting in a city talking and dueling, helping lowbies in the open world against gankers etc, that stretches the available content massively. But when you treat every aspect of the game like a checkmark its becomes boring if there is nothing to ckeck anymore.
---
Probably because that people who play pvp want to pvp rather than doing more brainless pve in "pvp" battlegrounds.
---
If you queue up for a battleground you want to fight with other players, not mount 5minutes, kill a boss and requeue.
---
whats the name of these figures on the screen?
---
Everyone asked for 1.8 no changes doesn't apply here because we know blizz was going to start with 1.12 patch no matter what. 1.8 av wouldn't be a change just like not having naxx out in 1.12 technically isnt a change
---
That was only the first patch. The ones inbetween were better mix between getting the boss up and pushing
---
#NoChanges
---
Alliance can zerg faster and you do get some rep from killing the NPCs.  So it's horde making the best of the situation.
---
You could try to start convincing people to stall or wipe the alliance zerg and give your offense more time.  But it won't be an easy task.
---
It's a meme that came from an episode of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
---
 https://youtu.be/AHzw4QvE2Do
---
Do you want to say that you are big?
---
Drink a free action potion and literally dumpster them in two hits.
---
There is no way that Blizzard isn't doing this on purpose. They could easily prevent faction imbalance, buff raids and AV. Not to mention the 1000s of bots running freely since launch and all the class bugs reported since beta. It took them months to add keyri g? Are there only 2 developers working on the entire thing?
---
You don't lose access to any reputation gains once you hit revered, so there is no advantage to waiting.
---
Quit bitching for everything in this subreddit. 
---
Only reasonable thing so far was the shitty memes that could be different. Yes its 2019 and if you did not want to ask/check in advance what is this subreddit then don‚Äôt cry now, its your fault.
---
Everything that happens including your post today is known long time already, stop acting like its something new and strange.
---
Btw you can be grateful that the way to farm karma is casual bitching rather than make good posts. I would like to see you then browsing reddit on shifts with your brother trying to explain to your mom why u cant have dinner together.
---
Grow up, if you disliked what you got so far - just quit already.
---
With old version you rushed but had to do towers and galv still. Also there were mines and elites do that upped the difficulty.
---
Many of whom played since Vanilla and are well aware of these things?
---
Just because you got turned into a cat doesn't mean you now know that spell.  Its his ability shifting you, like a mage poly-morphing you for example.
---
BIS for shaman tanks because of the high stamina and meaningful agility, just beats out the savage gladiator helm. 
---
Got one on my shaman in the AH for 40 gold could not be more thrilled
---
Yea enter instance with both chars. Hunter kills mobs, you can have ur war follow hunter since they're range. Otherwise have war wait within range of mobs.?

---
Golly gee, what a mystery.
---
I am a warrior and I feel you, but you can't claim mages are omnipotent.
---
I am fury and I have killed some, player skills are also important.
---
everyone understands the 10 english words you need in BGs
---
i dont see the problem
---
The very first iteration of AV made it damn near impossible to progress through BG due to mines everywhere which would insta-kill people. The only way you were able to make any progress was by pushing through the entire 40 man opposition, which was nearly impossible. Having these long-winded battles going on for hours and hours and hours is fun at first, but it grows old fast.
---
I don't understand why we aren't killing these bosses, free honor and rep
---
I've tried googling this but I can't find the answer: how do I join the same AV battleground with a friend that is in my party? We've tried clicking "fist available" at the same time and that doesn't work.
---
It does. I accidentally disenchanted my green Frozen Wrath cloak (same icon as another cloak) and then restored it.
---
Yeah its so boring. Gonna unsub actually. It was a fun ride though and a trip down memory lane. Gotta say PVP was alot more fun in 2004/2005 :)

---
Less than +5 weapon skill is worthless. More than +5 weapon skill is marginal (it reduces the glancing blow penalty: the sweet spot is +8, but +5 is whats important). 5 is what you want, and what you need to get.
---
But they have 1.6 AV in retail
---
Oh shit! Get the staff lad!
---
Except we didn't want this av so no shit we're going to complain
---
That I understand.
---
So from what I have gathered:
---
Even perfect WSG premades don't give you as much honour as a brainless AV zerg?
---
If you want to save them for a higher honor bracket you could.
---
&gt; Yes, Alliance have transferred. Because the options are stop playing or pay transfer. You fail to realize this every time.
---
Now who's dense, what I said was TO the server, not FROM, like is it actually possible to be this stupid? I'm only said it like 15 times, letting alliance transfer to and horde transfer from this server would also fix the issue without ruining the game for literally everyone left on the server.
---
&gt;  even if they have to really search.
---
Oh, so when alliance has to put in a tiny bit of effort to play on the server, that's ruining the game for them, but not when it's horde that has to?
---
&gt; It‚Äôs like talking to a fucking wall, my lord...Ok, fella...If people are flocking off of a server, it‚Äôs because, and I need you to follow me here...It‚Äôs because they ARE NOT enjoying the game on that server. I‚Äôm not insisting anything,
---
Yes, I am following that, they're not enjoying it because they're vastly outnumbered, but letting them flock of the server does nothing to solve the issue, it just fucks over everyone left behind AND ruins it for the other faction, how hard is that to understand?
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt use straw man when you have no idea what it is. It‚Äôll go a long way in making you less pretentious.
---
So you insisting on me just thinking this is a bad move because I want to farm honor as a horde on that server is not a strawman despite me *a* playing alliance and *b* not being on that server?
---
&gt; like ACTUALLY unplayable.
---
It's funny, because what you're describing sounds fucking awesome, if you're not the kind of crybaby who just logs out.
---
&gt; quit bitching that mommy and daddy Blizz didn‚Äôt give you free honor farm
---
And again, "only people who could be against this is people who want to farm honor"... what?
---
&gt;  and just be ok that the few hundred Alliance can actually PLAY the game now instead of getting farmed to pad your ego.
---
A. Twice in 1 post
---
B. How many hordes can not no longer play the game?
---
Exactly
---
They cap at 20
---
Back when AV lasted days, I grinded my WAr alt from like 52-60 in AV.  The Yeti cave was particular good because no one ever came in there.
---
if you're alliance...
---
as horde: 6 games, 6 losses, 2532 into neutral, 15 HK  
---
horde allowing the zerg loss is the dumbest thing imaginable. so glad my sub runs out in 3 days
---
That is certainly your opinion. It's very polished for what it is, it's just not fun for you. I havnt played wow for most of bfa but I enjoyed legion.
---
Does he bring his weight, though? 
---
If he was resto, would he be more universally useful? I mean, MC is easy so whatever, just use alts or memes. But I wonder how the community will start feeling about boomkin when the content gets a bit harder. Maybe not BWL yet, but AQ, Naxx?
---
Then again, I'm not a very edgy player. I had all 3 tank classes geared up in WildStar when I was MT, just for fights where it would be optimal to switch out to another class.
---
&gt; Yup, the down votes are from basement dwellers who's never worked in a major city

&gt;	That's my point, that the game is acquiring gear, not what you do with it. 
---
So?
---
&gt;	So if the acquiring of gear is really boring (like pvp without any competition) you probably shouldn't play it.
---
That is a bit like saying ‚Äúif acquiring of money is really boring you probably shouldn‚Äôt go to work‚Äù. Because you can‚Äôt just ignore the reward. The reward matters. You are willing to do something boring in life when you feel like you are getting something out of it.
---
It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúpixels‚Äù. You can‚Äôt say the same thing about money either.
---
Yes, this is a video game. But video games don‚Äôt have to be the opposite of boring. All they have to do is bring joy to you. Some very great games are quite boring by design. Take Sudoku, Solitaire or Gris.
---
WoW is a skinner box and thrives on your human weaknesses to gambling. The game is literally about the dopamine rush of getting those upgrades. If you don‚Äôt get that, then **you** are probably playing the wrong game.
---
alliance also compete against other alliance who farm honor faster

I got ~12k rep tonight and I also left for an hour and a half to do MC
---
I tried to get my trinket so I could teleport back as one or two games some pre-made (who were fucking uselessly bad) kept calling for it but I was always already at boss. So next game I decided to go grab it ... Hello 15 minutes deserter buff.
---
What a madlad
---
I recently hit 60 and started running dungeons and shit to get pre raid bis for that inevitable time i start raiding. I got a few questions though.
---
Dire maul- I know you enter it whenever you like it but is there a certain gear requirement? As in whats the bare minimum of gear required for me to not get told off and removed from a DM party? Pre raid bis? Half pre raid bis? Bis?
---
How does the need/greed go on mats that i actually need to craft a pre raid bis item? Do i greed anyway or is it okay to need them?
---
Yep
---
Auctioneer shows 3-4 gold on Herod.
---
I just found one and threw it on my mage alt tonight.
---
And stay down
---
Are you an Orc?
---
yeah, All i want to do is play a classic 1-2 hour AV match. I'm so sad its a zerg. You shouldn't be able to pull single generals out of the boss room. They should all the tethered together
---
Trinket kidney, zerker rage gouge/sap, if he tries to restealth be ready with charge as combat drops. Use health potion or fap if he's deadzone kiting, you need a handful of hits to kill him. That said once he gets some gear, perditions blade etc, it's going to be rough either way.
---
Yeah I am not blaming you. Times have changed. People didn't care too much in the past but now a lot of people are just doing everything as efficient as possible.
---
People can be as casual or serious as they please but don't try to act like something you're not.
---
Until the inevitable patch making it pre-nerf AV and forcing the matches to be longer it makes zero sense to take 2 extra minutes wasting time on the small bosses when you could just take out the tower masters in the main boss room and kill the boss quick and grind out fast honor/rep per hour.
---
Pvp trinket, consumables, engineering, rend, berserker rage to cancel gauge, intimidating shout, bandage, barov peasant caller, that about it. If you want to never lose a 1v1 Vs rogue get the Baron Rivendare 2h sword, the regen is actually broken stupid op.
---
So what? Nobody should have been looking to design an efficient way to do that anyway, it's not even remotely the point.
---
Only got to play 1 AV today. Horde won.
---
...The Musical
---
&gt;	It admits you need to cheat to reach that level, which means you are not good enough to do it alone.
---
No bone in this hissfit of you two. But those two conclusions are just false on a logical level. And I think you know they are, tbh.
---
Priest don't have the range to pull from bridge.
---
No one should design an efficient way to get items?
---
You can't get more than 20 so turn them when you get 20 or less otherwise you will not receive more if you have 20 in your inventory.
---
Are you fucking sorry?!
---
Why would they stay if they cant play the game they payed for.
---
what the fuck
---
you can queue from anywhere in the world?
---
blizztard really wants to fuck thing up eh? :D
---
You will have to visit a separate Artisan Leatherworker in Camp Mojache (assuming you are horde because of the location mentioned for your dragonscale trainer).  Additionally you will want to level up using normal recipes as you will only have a few Dragonscale specific recipes when you first specialize and they are not efficient for leveling up.  Most of the dragonscale recipes will either require pattern drops, faction-specific reputations, or be bought off of the AH.
---
Corpse camped by undead rogue. So probably not
---
if you are after rep over honor it doesnt matter
---
People are zerging because Alliance is predominately PvE and it‚Äôs the best way to get rep. 
---
They aren‚Äôt here for PvP or honor. They want their welfare epics.
---
People would pay for that.
---
Be the change you wanna see, there's still plenty of horde running to BRM.
---
Es tut mir leid?

---
Here‚Äôs the deal. Classic was going to be THE throwback game. It was what millions of people who played in 04-05 were hoping for. All those people that are disconnected with current gaming, can‚Äôt follow the speedrun, min-max, efficiency based style of modern day gaming - they were all hoping to go back to simpler times with this one. 
---
But, from pretty much day one, they have been denied this experience because Classic has succumbed to the same shit. 
---
It is incredibly frustrating to see. The one game that was meant to appeal to US and not THEM, is gone. Classic is just another 2019 game. Just another mindless race.
---
That is why people are bitching. They feel helpless and frustrated, because they cannot change what has happened to the game they wanted and thought was really happening.
---
This is just not true.   
---
On FP mostly yes. But on boats you had alliance groups of 15+ all the time. On raid night you had sometimes 40-120 flooding it. It was constant PvP with dispells, healing, burst damage, defending the rear of the boat.
---
Now it's unadultered dungeon crawling to gain honor and ranks.
---
Sucks but paid transfers
---
they go to your mailbox so you can hold as much as youd like before they expire
---
Just like back in the day amirite guys
---
We asked for 1.12, we even demanded 1.12, we're getting 1.12. We have no right to be upset when we get 1.12.
---
Also if you don't like AV there is WSG and world PvP you can do instead, it's great that there are options. And in the future we'll get AB and we'll have even more options.
---
But changing it to the older version instead of using the final "vanilla wow" product is a change, so yeah it is the #NoChanges mong's fault.
---
Another masterpiece. I love your work. I will frame your pics, I will put them in my "gaming room".
---
Are there high resolution pics for large scale printing available?
---
Is it possible to get an epic mount for 640g if i get exalted with AV and rank 4 honor?
---
Best regal Dad that struggle to get gold for epic mount
---
go eat shit pussy
---
The narrow hallway next to Iceblood Graveyard is a choke point that everyone must pass through.  A few mages with improved blizzard can wipe the zerg at that point, which sends them back to respawn at the last graveyard.  When they rez, they will wipe YOUR zerg....and the battle is on.
---
are you smoking crack? it's like 20 silver maybe
---
You are better off using Google Translate than to pretend you are having a conversation.
---
Im right there with him lol. Quit my lock to main my paladin, Ret is actually really fun.
---
*Laughs in Tyrande*
---
Who cares it's one dumb item
---
Have you actually played it recently? By now, it's played exactly the same as the retail version of AV, with both factions just base racing.
---
The difference is the current community is all assholes wanting to be e-famous on their shitty twitch streams which didn‚Äôt exist 15 years ago. Back then we made ‚Äúworld first‚Äù kill videos and pvp videos because it was cool to share stuff, not because we were trying to monetize the game due to not having any marketable skills in the real world.
---
Swords are still viable for PVP but you‚Äôll need really good ones that are pretty difficult to get. I can burst someone down in under 5 seconds as a coldblood hemo spec but I use Vis‚Äôkag and Brutality Blade.
---
You only need two as far as I'm aware, "go retail".
---
imagine complaining about shill on this subreddit
---
THe thing witht he day+ games was that you would leave after an hour, then go back maybe later that day, the same game is going on, then maybe the next day you'd go back and again, the same game was going on.
---
Felt like a true warzone.
---
Runeblade has been fixed/nerfed. Can no longer be snapshotted with anything and have zero scaling.
---
If the point was getting the item fast then they would just give them to you.
---
You claiming that way less people doing it than I think doesn't mean anything. All the proof that you have "very few" people do it or any proof that I have that a lot of people are doing it is just anecdotal since we don't have any numbers. However, I do know that I like how the balance of the economy is now and removing a gold sink might hurt that balance. So there is one way it may hurt my gaming experience.
---
And I very clearly stated the fact that I like being rewarded for sinking that gold into getting the best specc for my purpose. So if you want it more clear, my game is worse if we got dual specc because I'm not rewarded for spending time to farm to have money for respeccs.
---
On another note I like how you are OK to farm consumables to perform at your best in pve but you aren't OK to farm gold to perform at your best for pvp.
---
And a tip, join a guild or persuade your own guild to raid Tuesday and Wednesday which means you only need to respecc back and forth every second week. That'll cut it down the farm by 50%
---
You seem to have missed one of the central tenants of old school rpgs: getting good items takes an ungodly amount of time.
---
This is too true
---
They also spammed "1.12 #nochanges" non stop for almost two years. It looks like the loudest and most annoying voices won as usual.
---
It should come as no surprise that we'd be getting 1.12 since we pretty much threatened Blizzard to give us that version of the game.
---
Even if it takes a long time, you can still do it in an efficient manner
---
Fyi, grinding 900g is sometimes less effort than av exalted. Depending on your class and realm.
---
How is anyone abusing anything? People dont play the same way they did 15 years ago. They like to lie and pretend they do by buffing randos they pass while leveling but they don't *really* play the same at all. People are much smarter. Play more efficiently. Computer's play better. Servers run better. 
---
All of this adds up to an experience that will **never** be the same as people remember it. MC was cleared week 1. It was speed ran in less than 30 minutes. A huge amount of people don't even want their tier 1 because it's stat weights are worse for them.  
---
And, as seen this week, all of this stuff coupled together trivializes what people thought was going to be this super challenging back and forth with battles that encompass a full day.
---
Exactly why AV is being rushed because it's a trash bg and it has always been trash.
---
There is also the other side of Azeroth lol
---
Retail is so well polished, there isnt much else but polish left. Vanilla was successful because it wasnt completely polished, it had certain charm to it that's been polished away in retail.
---
Skull of impending doom breaks gouge and blind
---
American boomer joke
---
Is it same for WSG ?
---
but then they LIP and sheep you (which goes through fap), can't pummel a sheep with LIP on either.
---
Well said.
---
Nice
---
It loooooks like one of the goblin engineers, but I could be wrong.
---
probably yeah, horde has a strategic advantage in vanilla AV
---
Sorry but thats just not true. Most of the time you had 5 to 10 people using a boat and 20+ horde killing them twice. The only time this didnt happen was during raid hours where you had 100+ people going to ony.
---
if you are rushing, you are doing it wrong, because if your team fucks up anywhere you loose, and since you rushed you've given the opposing team a large boost in their chances.
---
Make the other sides life difficult, take a graveyard...do some other objectives
---
Yup, unfortunatly
---
My friends and I have been queueing for a specific number. Queues a bit longer though
---
You are aware that factions honor standing has no effect on each other right? So it literally does not matter if horde gets a million times the honor.
---
Well duh
---
I'm not upset ofc.
---
Im just debating.
---
Does anyone know why my tunneling service (Exit Lag) has stopped working after the patch?
---
*Drops dead*
---
You can't queue anywhere, but you can enter anywhere. Just like it was in 1.12
---
Implying no PvP happens on normal servers is what led to people going PvP when they would had been perfectly fine on normal servers from the start.
---
Whenever I've played my alt on a normal server I've seen tons of battle, especially in Hillsbrad.
---
This is a bug though, will be fixed soon enough
---
Very nice swords! I‚Äôll have to look up how to play cold blood hemo! Daggers look easier to get your hands on in general
---
Still got the OG 1.0 Box in my shelf, was horrible. However I tried it again this year in february and have since dumped \~2000 hours into it. Really the last time I was this invested in an MMO was shortly after TBC was released when I barely managed to hit 58 through Vanilla.
---
I do still play both Classic and FF XIV, wherein Asahi is the name of an NPC who would REALLY [creep you out..](https://i.redd.it/w817ii15aez01.png)
---
but that does not matter at all,
---
ranks are faction specific, so on the horde side is more honor but they are worth completly the same when everyone gets 3 times as many noone wins
---
All I takes is a group of 5 alliance (Maybe that‚Äôs you and 4 buddies) to kill ever LT and Commander.. you can manage that in the time it takes for the group to down Drek.. and there‚Äôs your 2.8k honor in 6 minutes compared to 900
---
Wat
---
On this version of AV, Alliance won 95% of all avs back in the day
---
I quit playing recently and the only thing I regretted was missing BGs. This doesnt make me feel as bad! I'd honestly be happy that someone's backcapping. Out of those 40 people, how many of them will actually reach a rank that's beneficial to spend time caring about their honor/hour? Like 1 or 2? The game really has changed with the way people play it
---
Ah didn't read that part sorry.
---
I'm waiting to see how blizztards will adress the growing shitstorm.
---
Earthshaker is quite even. Differernt zones have different factions. 
---
Feralas is constantly camped by Alliance to the point people are barely running DM as you won't get there alive. Not to mention LHC is almost always being camped by a huge raid.
---
If you spend a couple of hours it means it can be solved in 10 mins.
---
Yea, it's pretty disgusting.
---
I for one, like that it's like this. AV can serve a valuable dual function as rep farm for fresh 60ies and a ranker containment zone. Might make solo-queue WSG actually fun as opposed to just getting you stomped by premade honor farms.
---
tried several times to play retail a few years ago, but people just didnt answere when i asked them for help... i wasnt sure if i was on some chinese server or something like that
---
Thay I can agree on.
---
Only problem with this is: a waaaaay higher pop server cap.
---
Which makes imbalances even worse.
---
Dungeons can be done in greens, just know your role and class.  If you‚Äôre new to the dungeon, let people know beforehand.  
---
For mats, it‚Äôs typically greed unless you mention it beforehand for bop Libram items.
---
Depends on the server, I guess. I'm playing on Venoxis (56:44 H:A ratio) and we had to fight for our honor. We died all the time, but because you just resurrect when the boat switches, you just keep killing each other. Even if you only manage to kill 4 out of 15, it's still decent to great honor.
---
So you can have it the fastest way possible and can stay logged off again bored till next content release? No thanks.
---
did you play the earlier versions of AV? they were not what we have now.. not at al
---
As a mage would it be worth it to drop Herb (got Alch aswell) and pickup Tailoring instead just for the Robe of the Archmage? I'm 2/2 T2 already and I got 2 T1 pieces aswell, but despite clearing raids every ID I have yet to see the goddamn Arcanist Robe drop.
---
There'd be close to no loot competition for the Arcanist Robe.
---
I don't farm a lot of Herbs anyway, but I don't really want to drop a solid gathering profession that could hypothetically make me gold if I needed it.
---
People have known since before Classic was released, that this was the AV we were getting. Its been stated many times. So again, if folk dont like it, dont play it! its that simple.
---
From a horde perspective, it is absolutely ruining any fun AV used to bring. They would rather lose on purpose to farm honor than actually try to win and get more rep and a more fun experience overall. 
---
I'm not going for rank 14. I just wanted to have fun playing the bgs I used to love. But the way the horde handled today was absolutely pathetic.
---
you should know that 5% still results in some misses
---
Good to know. Im at 500g and i make like 150g per week farming herbs. Then i will continue farming until i get my epic mount
---
Yeah I know, I was just stating instead of rep, they are just being honor efficient and playing it to get more honor, while we are rushing for the win and getting less. So it's better for the rep grind for alliance was all I was saying :)
---
10/10 - have an upvote my friend!
---
Soon as you get out, rend him, switch to zerker, pop zerker rage, hs, ww, switch back to battle stance, op when it procs is priority, ms when you got the rage.  
---
Theres other things to do. If he starts making space, switch to zerker, run/walk away from him to intercept. You can also switch to defensive to disarm but i wouldnt say its necessary since modt of the time youll be critting them so hard, the rage to disarm is a waste. Dont forget you have fear, though not as strong for ud, works for others.  
---
Unless the rogue is ultra top tier or they massively outgear you, the matchup is heavily favored for warriors. Its like a 8-2.  
---
Your priorities are as follows: rend&gt;hs&gt;op. Rend shouldnt fall off unless somehow the battle lasts a real long time but no matter *what* you need to rend **first**. Most rogues will panic and waste their prep trying to double vanish, it stops bandage shenanigans, resap shenanigans. 99% of rogues dont know how to deal with it.  
---
Another thing is: do **not** stay in berserker stance. You want to switch to it mainly for zerker rage and intercept, *maybe* get a ww, but dont wait to get it, just switch the fuck out. The reasons why should be obvious: you take 10% more damage and you cant OP.  
---
Remember you can zerker rage out of sap, but its risky staying in that stance. If you ever walk into a rogue, pop bloodrage and demo shout immediately to pull them out of stealth. You hopefully can just auto them and then rend, if you get that, you pretty much won.
---
because its first day
---
Solid 5/7 comment
---
lol bro you got him good üëåüëåüëåüëå
---
Ideal selection of classes in a party of 5 killing off random non-grouped players from every level bracket all hours of every day. Then another welcome party on the pier in Theramore. The only argument I buy is that you had competition on raid nights, the rest was pure grief.
---
So, as a follow up, I queued up at 2:30 am and was in a bg within 10 minutes so I'll take that all day.
---
I've already learned that they released some kind of PVE version of AV, will have to test this weekend. If I dislike that too I will continue to uninstall as the game will then have nothing more to offer
---
Yeah, I'd rather 10-15 hours AVs for sure, 5 hours is way too short
---
well you don't have to send the whole 40 man to kill belinda or the horde one, just need like 5 people lol.  i'd say it's worth it for sure.
---
Mostly the elite Troggs in the mines but yeah, this.
---
Your problem is not you're a 56 Hunter.
---
It's that you apparently spent the last 50 levels or so not putting together a friends list of healers and tanks you can do dungeons with.
---
Do a /who. Look for a Paladin or a Druid. See if they'd like to tank. Then find a healer. Then look for two other DPS.
---
No it's not lol. Nobody in the #nochanges camp ever wanted the 1.12 version of vanilla wow from the start. Literally nobody. Everyone wanted a progressive patch system starting from earlier patches and an earlier AV. Neither of which we got.
---
This is so good! Convinced me to make an alliance alt just to venture into Deadmines again!
---
Wasn't even trying to get him yet here you are with your salt lol
---
Should YouTube lbrs xp grind.
---
Then you can hate mages.
---
Just cap stonehearth with some mates as Horde and see how the rush ends.
---
yes, instance and autofollow. 
---
You can run Scarlet Mon over and over and over with the hunter doing all the killing. You'll get great tanking gear in here, which will help you quest, and then you can get the hunter to help with the elite quests as you suggested.
---
Absolutely sell it, unless you‚Äôre planning on staying at the 39 PvP bracket forever as you‚Äôll replace it at 60
---
QQ more. Why do I have to farm raids week after week to get gear? It's not supposed to be easy and doable in a few days
---
ffs I dont want to play with nazis
---
good job killing classic blizztard
---
Because the addons require time to get updated
---
Winning 3-0 wsg gives half as much honor as losing an av
---
This pretty much kills wsg groups
---
Would have been much happier if only wsg came out
---
Who would have thought that completely removing an entire API that addons have used for forever would cause a bunch of LUA errors.
---
Oh wow
---
No, solo queue only. You can try the 3-2-1 click method, does not work great.
---
Yeah im sure this is very different from server to server. But im sure that most server have a problem here outside of prime time. I just cant imagine that you have 10+ max lvl alliance regulary go to or from theramore.
---
No, but I believe it does take away the mats you got for disenchanting it.
---
Agreed. Its a dub for that. I saw someone post 8 of the same items and wondered how maby pll were doing that
---
Best way to get lost honor?
---
You realize there isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù. All those alliance players who didn‚Äôt constantly complain and got their world PvP kills are going to stay ahead of you until they stop deciding to PvP.
---
Nope, neither does ubrs key or onyxia.
---
How much rep per win?
---
Thanks for sharing! :)
---
I hate doing dungeons now, there‚Äôs always some dude opening with a variation of ¬´¬†ok big packs come on come on come on gooooooo¬†¬ª
---
Same with searing gorge key
---
Yeah but it kills wsg premade groups for hord
---
Weirdly I keep getting more honor than alliance even with losing. I got to honored today and I think ally only beat us on honor like 3-4 times, even though I've only won maybe 4 games total.
---
Got Rhok the other day. Damn its fun when you find a unshielded mage or warlock drinking. 
---
One shot!
---
So, let me get this right....you're QQing cos horde players are killing alliance Lts and commanders, where as alliance are zerging to Drek missing everything else out.....and crying cos Horde get more honor?!?!?!
---
old AV was live for longer than nerfed npc AV, old AV is more vanilla,  it is more #nochanges, nerfed npc AV was the beginning of the end of AV
---
When you proc crusader with one weapon, you can switch to another with crusader or 25 agi to either proc another crusader or have 25 agility.
---
Zerg is better honor than WSG. AV in two weeks will be the ranker containment zone, I think.
---
I personally really like the style of paladins. I played a warlock to 30 initially while using the paladin as a bank alt. Going into classic as someone who hadn't played vanilla i had no idea what to expect from the classes. 
---
While The combat wont be for everyone, Its a lot like old school runescape combat, I played OSRS quite a bit and when someone made the comparison i decided to try it out. The warlock is still level 30 and my Ret pala is raid geared.
---
While leveling you have ALOT of tools to deal with pretty much any situation you find yourself; Self heals, immunities, instant cast cc, lay on hands, blessing of freewin. 
---
Raiding as ret is hard, you have to fully sweat it out to do 70% as much damage as warrior who wont need to try anywhere near as hard. I raid as ret personally.  You do make up for the lack of damage with the utility though, dispells during bosses, blessing of protection for threat control/saves, another aura for another group, another blessing etc. While holy can do these things too, you wont have 5+ holy paladins in one raid, you need priests and druids for their buffs too.  
---
Speaking of holy this is likely what your guild will want you to raid as, its pretty busted, the best single target healer in the game by far, throwing out rapid fire flash of lights or holy lights super mana efficiently.  I have not seen a holy pala go oom. Biggest weakness is a lack of aoe heals or heals over time. Paladins have to hard cast single target heals. They also arent exactly the most... interactive raid spec but this isn't unique to them and a lot of raid rotations end up being 2-3 spells. In this case flash of light rank 3-6 85% of the time.
---
Prot is super fun for making money and tanking 5 mans, you pretty much can sleep through it while doing good damage thanks to all the reflect. Not so great in raids since you cant taunt and becoming immune to crushing blows means you need redoubt, which is a talent that increases your block after being crit. Can tank onyxia with the blessings threat method, people wont really be that likely to agree unless its a guild run. As prot with reckoning pvp becomes hilarious, after letting a mob hit you while pressing a certain macro, after about 15 seconds you can select anyone for deletion with a reckoning bomb. Takes some prep but is very fun. Reckoning also makes fury warriors or rogues hilariously easy to kill in pvp, each time they crit you with their fast weapons you get a bonus swing on your big dick 2h, get a double swing with a double seal of command proc, the rogues dead and the warrior is low af with no way to heal himself quickly.  Rogues will often open on me and then just get one shot because of the crits they stacked up on me while i was stunned.
---
TLDR: Pallys are great. if i had to order the strongest to weakest specs Holy&gt;ret&gt;prot. Holy is busted, Ret is try-hard for not that great results and prot just kinda got fucked by blizzard interms of raids.

---
The thing is that AV is just zerg pvp... the same dumb large group pvp we've had for months now and it's boring. We just want the quick wins for the rep rewards.
---
WSG pvp is SOO much fun. If you're looking for actual pvp, queue for that. But if in AV, don't intentionally troll your team and cap other GY because it causes people to rez in the wrong place, lose game = less rep, etc...
---
You get way more honor anyway spamming WSG and winning and it takes actual skill and not just zerg tactics like AV pvp even if you're 'playing it properly'.
---
What anime is this? I'm so confused. Stone golem dudes?
---
Wtf! Now I'm mighty pissed without even stepping foot into AV yet &gt;:(((
---
I remember there used to be some addons to sync the queues somehow long time ago. Gonna have to keep an eye out for it again.
---
I don't think BGs give you experience, otherwise how would twinks be a thing?
---
Imagine thinking of battlefield as a game that takes skill
---
Strange how people stop playing games when they become riddled with microtransactions.
---
System -&gt; graphics -&gt; advanced -&gt; take off auto graphics and put it on your gaming card.
---
As a Prot warrior. Rogue is pretty much the only class I can 1v1 without issue
---
GL with r14.
---
I wonder what it does if you have used those mats already
---
I usually just go to the kitchen and smoke a joint.
---
The point is REP with winning fast, not honor. The rep rewards from AV are 10 times better than anything you're going to get from the honor rank rewards anyway. Don Julios and Don Rodrigos literally never get replaced in all of vanilla.
---
It existed then. Casuals were just the majority and information wasn't as readily available. Did y'all expect the people who have been playing pserver for 14 years to not use knowledge they acquired? It's not ruining classic, you just haven't played on a pserver with this solved game have you?  This is the state of the game, take it or leave it. Bumblefuck vanilla is gone, people know a lot now and will use that to their advantage.
---
IMO watching TV is so much worse than playing video games. Playing WoW can be mentally stimulating in a number of ways, and encourages socialization even if it's behind a keyboard. When you watch TV your mind just goes into standby mode.
---
This is lesters House from GTAV
---
Yes, it's a joke just like we said it would be.
---
I miss Nost, a team that actually cared about the vanilla community and provided the best version of AV there was. I fucking loved that thing.
---
Current AV is so fucking stupid.
---
or 1.12 talents without bwl out yet lol
---
Burning out lol, I've played runescape for 12 years, I don't burn out.
---
All you can hope for personally is to gather 4-5 others from your server and join as a premade, forcing a turtle within your own match. It‚Äôs unlikely this with gather any traction, as most players don‚Äôt visit this sub
---
1% Hit is around 14 SP. Go to the warlock discord, you can sim your character with an excel sheet there, it will give you your stat weights for your gear and buffs.
---
&gt; Their way of playing the game is being as efficient as possible to get the items they need
---
And then stop playing the game cause there's nothing left to do.
---
Do you think in  a group of 40 randoms from your own server, noone would roll need on an epic item to sell on the auction house?
---
because everyone(incl pve players) are farming, give it 2 weeks and que times will be high for hordes
---
Nice comment dickbag
---
Just get a group of defenders and force a turtle. Defend the Iceblood GY and Frostwolf GY. Dont let the alliance zerg straight to Drek.
---
Amazing work
---
Most people don‚Äôt understand the profit motive either. I‚Äôve  easily spent a couple hundred dollars on retail by buying tokens and level 110‚Äôs PLUS my subscription.
---
Blizzard only wants classic to be successful to get people to retail. Retail shits on classic for how much blizzard makes profit wise. 
---
Classic is not a smart money move without micro transactions. And that‚Äôs not gonna happen in classic
---
Under the stupid assumption that people in 2005 wouldn't be doing the same tactic then if they had smart enough teams.
---
It's live on EU?
---
get 5 or so friends and defend. this then stops the zerg and you get a longer game.
---
That‚Äôs just a crappy thing to do to your team mates.
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea myself. I think be the chance you want to see in the world and force turtles if you really want. Not even sure if it‚Äôs no changes, as pre 1.12 is the OG AV format with the goblin shredders and mine fields
---
Zum'rah Vexing Cane from ZF can be obtained at low 40s (albeit drop rate isn't amazing) and is only slightly worse. You'll also get a better mainhand+offhand combo in mid 50-s.
---
Judging by your impressions, I would recommend warlock. Leveling another auto attacker might be tedious. Warlocks utility is great and they're strong in PvE and PvP. Plus they are easy to level and are just sexy.
---
it is. and I already finished 5 AVs at least
---
Good, go shadowlands
---
You get tokens you have to turn in.
---
I'm level 57 and got 15-20% of a level in experience in one evening.
---
That's correct but they still don't play the bgs like that because of the reputation. No one cares if they get the rings today or on Sunday. I also think I've heard that the caster ring isn't available until p5.
---
That is why you go to the least populated city and queue from there.
---
The robe is best in slot until ZG, so it's a good investment for sure.
---
The main miscommunication here is that we are not honor grinding (those that want to rush). We want REP. Because the rep rewards are far better than the pvp rank rewards and easier to get. As long as you don't turtle every game you can get the rep banged out in a couple days. If you turtle... it takes a week or weeks to grind out the rep 2 points at a time.
---
The change that blizzard needs to make is to make it easier to grind out the rep while playing the game as it's intended. Increase rep rewards for kills/objectives so it's worth collecting armor scraps or whatever.
---
More like jokers. The dude is a joke
---
imagine playing a videogame in 2019 and you cant play that videogame anymore for a few minutes
---
like fucking hell, this is peak social injustice. classism, racism, equal rights dont have anything on this. i, for one, *demand* my 24/7 playtime in a 15-year old videogame. lets start tumblr-blog and cry wolf on every social media platform out there. DOWN WITH THE BLIZZARD PROLETARIAT! WORKERS OF THE WORLD ^((of warcraft)) ARISE!
---
Is it tied to wow executable by any chance? They renamed it from wow.exe to wowclassic.exe I think, so any tools that rely on specific name need to be updated
---
As a mage, you don't really need gathering to make gold. Plus, once you have your robe, you can drop tailoring again and re-skill herbalism. And the robe is reaaally cool - so I'd get it
---
If shadowbolt and frostbolt are the same to you, I don't even know where to start the conversation lol. But as a paladin having more abilities hidden behind a spec feels off and bad. I did love having dual specs / free respec so I'm not saying retail is pure bad, would have loved classic with some qol features of later games.
---
But class design was on a better track pre-cata. Blizz has never been great at balance but talents have always provided a way to tweak your build next to gear. Yes, 5, 10, 15% smth may not seem like much but it is and it extra is when you top off what you get via gear. You had less spells hidden behind specs and had more ways to build your toon while leveling and during end game. (I do concede that some people follow guides to a tee without understanding them properly and this was terribly bad in wotlk where they'd follow guides but have gear not suited for it but that's a different discussion)
---
But I did play mostly tbc and wotlk, didn't play to much vanilla back in the day and cataclysm class changes pushed me away from the game.
---
Why is the mission called no russian?
---
Main reason I like to keep it manual-is with item rack.
---
Yes I'm sure all the people with raid gear feel soooo stupid right now /s
---
&gt; Dps ideally shouldn't start AOE until you at least get a sunder or revenge on all mobs
---
Ahh.. if only.
---
I'm well aware of this.  It was a mistake to change in 1.7 and it remains a mistake now.  
---
I'm well aware that this is indeed exactly how 1.12 AV really was.  I'm also well aware that 1.12 AV was only a very small portion of what AV was like throughout most of retail vanilla.
---
Lol, fking 10 idiots took my post serious
---
/sarc
---
Is that necessary nowadays, peolple are just below avg IQ..
---
I'm not sure how this matters.
---
That Ouro dude on horde streams too I think
---
AV exalted takes longer than farming the difference between AV mount and normal epic mount (160 gold), but if you don't mind lagging behind your team in every AV and want the other reputation rewards anyway, then might as well go for it.
---
Gz on circlet of flame
---
.
---
If you‚Äôre smart you‚Äôll ask people to pass lead and turn on master looter
---
Downvotes does not change the fact people just rush for Boss and finish AV in 10 minutes guys.  Can't even get people to kill Balinda.
---
Massive thank you to the boys in &lt;Takeover&gt; for making this dream possible. &lt;3
---
If you defend something we will report you with our group so you get kicked out and have a forced 15min break.
---
Either play by our rules and dont play at all.
---
Never played AV on nost, but that sounds like a good AV!
---
No it wasn't. I didn't say you did? I'm just perplexed why you took the time out to post this, even putting battleground in quotes as if to be cynical, only to not bother going for honourable kills.
---
I am this guy. It is so mind numbingly boring to slow walk through a dungeon, only pulling one enemy, sheeping the rest. I want a challenge.
---
t. Gnome Mage
---
If everyone missed honour, then noone missed honour
---
Damn, 6 weeks? I live in Europe too but here you generally get only 5 weeks if you're under 35.
---
Its almost 50/50. Thing is, Alliance Control stuff that most people see, like BRM.
---
Horde controls farming areas.
---
North of Hillsbrad, if you climb the hills you'll see a large camp.
---
Horde have the strat figured out. Lose on purpose while maximizing rep and honor in that timeframe. Have even been stalling alliance more and more just to pick up extra elites for the 200 honor.
---
what alliance are getting honor faster tho
---
unless you are getting a wsg queue insta with a premade and 3 capping/re-queuing in under 10-15 minutes then AV is still the best honor alliance are getting
---
If you don't want to run Dungeons, this is a great way to gear up for pvp.
---
Weirdly I want to gear up in pvp for pvp but I *have* to wait a *long* time for an opportunity for loot roulette which will take *ages*. At least in bgs it's in my hands.
---
Why would you downvote this? youre prob gunna get cursed
---
What? You're not killing the bonus mobs. They're letting you win to reset their instance.
---
Not accounting for the time spent and that the other faction might rush and you lose anyway.
---
&gt;.you know, actually playing the game.
---
i mean it goes both ways. rushing to win is still playing the game, just a different way of doing it
---
i enjoy both, i like fast zerg who can win first games, and i like 45 minute long back and forths. both are "actually playing the game", just different ways
---
Thats what is being explained, horde are getting faster honor and alliance are getting faster rep.
---
I had forgotten the rewards, some of them are really great...
---
So, the current meta is just to rush boss, and it's over as fast as possible ? If so, how long does it take to reach exalted ?
---
On the vast majority of pservers, AV was a dead meme and only revived for AV weekends and everybody was fine with that. It was even released on an AV weekend on LH, I think. Or maybe on Nost.
---
Not even the rep farmer want to play AV, nobody wants. You do it, be done with it and never look back. But now all are stuck in this mess of a BG. 
---
Now the people actually interested in PvP are stuck dungeon crawling AV for honor and it's so not fun.
---
There was like 3 totems in my spell book. And believe it or not I did actually like the version of shaman that was balanced (albeit poorly) around being a relatively stationary turret. Wotlk / cata shaman was my favorite iteration of shaman. It had a totem system and class identity that hit the balance of powerful and unique.
---
It looks like all EU servers are in one battlegroup, including the russian servers.
---
There's no way any of this is real.
---
The captains take no time at all and give you a bunch of extra honor. You get that honor even if you lose, so it‚Äôs beneficial for both teams to do them because then you still get a significant chunk for losing.
---
Reeeee
---
Any FPS takes skill, sit down man.
---
lmao, true dat!
---
It's fun as heck though
---
If we get AV weekend on friday it would be 50% more rep.
---
I never played it but can't you defend your base..?
---
I have decided to go for 29 twink for easier competition since I'm a big noob and never played wow before. Now I'm stuck getting the BiS bow from RFK for 4 days no, got the rare elite 2x so far and both times he dropped the shoulders.
---
banthok and star are p much hard BiS right now. unless you're rocking choker of the fire lord or vectus neck, you should be using star
---
and banthok is bis for a hot minute, t2 belt is better i think in p3
---
the real argument is chest....t1 chest vs rotv vs volatile. i'd say ROTV is more or less BiS right now in general. lock discord has volatile power + mana igniting cord as BiS but thats some weird sim shit where its "technically" bis but its a dream-gear scenario
---
get star, get banthok, use either ROTV, volatile or t1 chest.
---
I'd leave because progression is important to me, but that's me. You need to figure out where you're at and what you value here: do you feel really awesome in this group, or just comfortable? Is the guild moving forward, or do you think you'll be stuck without a full roster for a long time? Do you think the guild is going to stick together for a while?
---
Where you should be is where you're going to have the most fun; bluntly, it doesn't sound like your guild is probably ever going to crack shit like Horsemen or C'Thun, but there's still lots of encounters like Rasuvious and Skeram that's easy to handle through Phase 6, maybe even PUGgable. The Horsemen broke my classic guild, and I want to clear them very, very badly; I'm prepared to commit the time to get that done. Are you, and more importantly, do you want to?
---
You must ride the mount until you fill your progress bar soldier! How dare you want to play the game, BGs were never made for PvP.
---
Classic is pretty much free profit for them - they've set it up so that the maintenance costs will be minimal - AND it's marketing for the version of the game with lots of micro transactions.  Win-win.
---
Micro transactions not happening in Classic?  They've already all but announced paid server transfers - that's a micro transaction.  Classic won't have the number or variety of micro transactions that retail does, very true.
---
I mean yeah
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter. If the loser gets the gold medal, then what‚Äôs the point of winning? I couldn‚Äôt give two shits about the horde PvP brackets.
---
Like I pointed out, several alliance friends are already exalted, so it‚Äôs really just a trade off
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrNrLly1vvM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrNrLly1vvM)
---
They say they don't enjoy it. 
---
Do you remember what forums were like when Phase 2 dropped? Do you have any idea how many people complain about the mindless grind for gold? People get into this rat race to fit in the wow tryhard community standarts and end up ruining their own experience, just because most people have the mount ready at 40, and they dont, they feel bad and try to compensate with stupid actions. That is stupid, not being good at the game or spending much time on it.
---
I agree. I just dont get why people are moaning. You either like playing classic or you dont. If you dont like it, go play something else. Its really that simple.
---
If you are going to rep up with Argent Dawn get the trinket and grind undead mobs in the plaguelands.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll just do this quest before I go to bed..
---
Ugh, never mind, this post reads [removed] when I'm not logged in.
---
&gt;Make battlegrounds count towards the 5-per-hour instance limit.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This could turn those 5-minute AV games into 12-minute games. 7 minutes of PvP is better than none.
---
&gt;* You have to be in the BG for 2 minutes before it counts towards the instance limit, so people who join just before a BG ends aren't penalized.
---
&gt;* You have to have an available instance slot when you queue for the BG. If you queue up for a BG, then enter a PvE instance while you're waiting, you can still enter the BG even though it takes you past the limit.
---
&gt;This post has been censored and no longer appears on r/classicwow/new. Too many downvotes, maybe.
---
Yeah, pattern is that blizzard is making some bad decisions.
---
P2 without BGs would be great as a some large scale pvp event but P2 without BGs as a long term content was fail and they should expect it!
---
And now shitty AV that can be done within 5 minutes... And no, that is not a failure of players either.
---
Both are bad game designs.
---
The winning play in this conversation would be to not participate.
---
lock discord is a great source of info for locks and whatnot but careful what you take from that info. IE their BiS list is technically BiS yes, according to the sim, but the chances of a warlock getting all of that gear any time soon is probably around 0.1%. 
---
(also had a bunch of sweaty nerds rage at me when i asked for real/in game examples of volatile power/mana igniting cord being BiS, IE a WCL with a warlock with those, got labeled an idiot/troll/etc lol)
---
Woah
---
And now we see the violence inherent in the system!
---
When is crackdown 3?
---
You should see a youtube video. There's a lot of information to explain.
---
people love to complain.  
---
But they don't understand the logic that voting with your wallet is infinite times more effective than voting with useless reddit posts.
---
As someone whos never even seen rag submerge you have so much more free time in a guild more dedicated.
---
The worst part is that he will *not* be ignored, because it's also best honor. You now dungeoncrawl AV for best honor for ranks. Urgh.
---
too bad they're all undoable in the 5 minute zergfests that every AV match seems to be now
---
Pve sucks which is why I want to PvP but pves keep trying to make me pve in my PvP
---
totally agree. all it takes is 5 horde to defend Iceblood GY and Frostwolf GY and stop the alliance Zerg.
---
Can you at least tell us what the sandwich is made of?
---
I'd like to agree, but then I see Ion's deadpan face in a new interview and all I can think of is "Hello Darkness my old Friend". I'd be surprised if we won't see more fuck ups/lazy implementation of classic features in the coming phases.
---
you will if 5 people report you.
---
what's the difference, slower or faster honor gains with this version ?
---
I'd like to have both versions. You pick which one you queue for.
---
ItemRack is also a great addon, I can't play without it on my paladin. Not only does it swap item when you mount, you can have other conditions to put gears on. In Stormwind/Ironforge? Put on some leisure suit and a silly hat. No need to individually swap the items.
---
Yes, rush rush rush. Need honor. Get gear. More gear. Oh now there's nothing to do. This is so boring. I quit.
---
While they were explaining the rules, I was thinking " why even explain the submerge, we won't get there". I was wrong.
---
And yes, Having to do 2 raid nights in MC will become a problem when BWL releases. I remember Vael being a guild breaker since you needed some coordination and gear to do it. I don't think we can do that!
---
Is it me or this dude looks like Jesse from breaking bad?
---
Yes you will. 5 AFK reports = instant kick, even if you're in the middle of a fight. Great system.
---
If you have ideas on how to improve the game, should we just quit?
---
People complain because theyre passionate and care about something, don't confuse it with hating something.
---
It's possible to be critical of something you like, in fact it's very natural to feel strongly about things you like.
---
Voting with your wallet is a very weird argument I feel like and not a constructive way to show your support and opinions.
---
Don‚Äôt give them the choice. Tell a group to stay behind and defend, and if you have 5-8 people you can AoE the crap out of the bridge and wipe  quite a number of people, who then get sent back to their starting base, right in the middle of your zerg party.
---
Turtles are fun. Plus it keeps the freeloaders from passively earning PvP ranks they don‚Äôt deserve.
---
ah yes, fast queue times, shitty gameplay, the hallmark of retail. you should try it out, you'll love it there
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25304-AutoCarrot.html
---
You're welcome.
---
People are allowed to enjoy the time they spend on something while still disagreeing with the way it's being run. If it's making you miserable and you spend four hours a day raging about it, you should probably quit, yes. But I'm not going to apologize for thinking Blizzard needs to be doing way more to deal with server population issues and faction balance, both on megaservers and dying ones.
---
I would like to be playing this game for a long time, through Classic+ or WotLK. If Blizzard doesn't start taking this shit more seriously and communicating more, my experience is probably going to suffer for it. So no, I will not apologize for voicing my opinions, and neither you or anyone else should shut up because you don't like the fact people are complaining.
---
Alliance is full of whiners who ruin everything with their whining
---
See how you sound? That's how you sound. Don't get mad because we figured out how to get honor/rep... without even really doing much aside from killing NPCs.
---
Yea, it goes to 0 durability
---
Yeah, it's been this way since the start and people come back for every expansion while simultaneously complaining about how it's the worst one yet. They simply can't let go. It's either addiction or a sunk cost fallacy for time.
---
I dont remember like this at all. There was a patch that changed the game from turtling to base rushing over night.
---
Yes, but they take an entire bag slot, leaving them with much less space overall than simply a few mats taking up some space.
---
Once you get exalted, you‚Äôre just stuck getting worse honor than the other faction... horde will get exalted, it may take a couple more days, but the honor won‚Äôt stop.
---
I tried starting a guild called Unoptimized for people that want to play the game without looking up info about it but I couldn‚Äôt even get enough signatures, seems like most people enjoy your play style more.
---
Perhaps I'd prefer the first option if we had the numbers to fill up our own raid. Right now, we're doing a joint effort with another guild, which seems flawed, to me. If we don't end up fusing I'm not sure how it'll progress.
---
It's true, though, that we had a flawless kill on Sulfuron and Golemagg, even Domo. I need to think about it..
---
[That's a nice name you have there, OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/deka6w/just_my_level_50_warrior_its_been_a_long_trip_but/)
---
Pick one
---
Progression &gt; fun
---
Or
---
Fun &gt;  progression
---
You could even have the best of both worlds and leave alts in fun guild whilst having your main hardcore.
---
ok
---
But ranking system is faction specific so it wouldn't really matter.
---
Wait, that's a bug? Warlocks can't give out healthstones?
---
I doubt that. If you do crazy grinds like that you are committed to the game and want to show off.
---
Do you like auto-attacking and having 1 spell on a 10 second cooldown as your only offensive? Then roll a Paladin!
---
SUKA BLYAT
---
I dont think thats how woosh works
---
MC was cleared week one because the gear and talents are infinitely better now. Just standing in one spot and clicking frostbolt does at least double the dps now compared to what it did back then.
---
Yeah i'm saying, I heard that this wasn't occurring in classic.. wondering if that's what was fixed
---
I'll check that one out too thank you
---
I mean consistency is a big thing, premading wsg gives consistent good teams that can get quick games going. AVs can turn into slow turtles that produce almost no honor and you can choose to afk out for 15 min deserter while the WSG premade is pumping honor continuously. 
---
If everything goes perfect av might be more, sure, but no group q reduces consistency of games
---
You need roughly 250 of it
---
I keep seeing this word ‚Äúefficient.‚Äù I don‚Äôt play a game to be ‚Äúefficient‚Äù I play a game to PLAY THE GODDAM GAME.
---
I lead a wow classic 40man raid I can shine so light on the perspective of the leadership. I learnerd wuite fast, that each somewhat serious(even casual serious) raiding guild in classic will bleed members like crazy. If people leave and tell the leadership via pn/mail and they didn't get much/any gear then we just say: yeah okay, whatever. If you're one of those 3: 
---
* Main tanks/ important Offtanks
---
* Healers
---
* People who got more than one piece of gear/got a piece of BIS
---
Then obviously your departure will sting and if things go from bad to worse, I'll put people on my shitlist so I know who I won't invite when they come crawling back. Still, Nobody can FORCE you to stay. If you wanna leave, then fucking leave. You'll do the leaders a favour by being blunt and sayy what you wanna do. Apply at another guild and once you can switch guilds tell your old guild the news and be done with it. Nobody wants a drawn out, painful separation
---
Or people are starting to remember that you get better honor from grinding down the objectives than you do winning so if you‚Äôre trying to farm honor then you should let the alliance rush drek while you take all the towers and kill all the elites so you get like 3000 rep per game while they get 800.
---
You're partially correct, but more correct than the guy you were responding to (that's all that counts, right).
---
Warmaster/marshal buffs were not added until patch 2.4. They did not exist at any point in vanilla, pre-BC or initial release.

Isn't that what MC is?
---
I hear there's a subreddit for a version of this game with more modernized graphics. Even Deadmines has an overhaul. I think the dedicated sub for it is r/wow
---
Hopefully i have minor speed and swiftness pots to escape those... Ouf!
---
I never said that I was opposed to it - I said I am split.
---
I totally understand the Pro's and Con's and for me (because I am not on a "unplayable" pvp realm) it is split.
---
You would be surprised how much that isn't an outlier. I have seen a couple of Posts of exactly that Happening with free Transfers. And those were on to shit Servers. So why not do it when you actually plan on transferring anyway.
---
I never said that it is an way more important issue xD But I can see that this Topic really goes under your Skin so I won't get into this. 
---
Don't be mad at me I just wanted to Point out the negatives because OP asked for it. I never said I was for or against it.
---
You better read careful =)
---
cheers!
---
I am very confident that if Blizzard doesn't adjust their communication style enough to start listening, people will start burning out and leaving. I'm confident in this because that's largely (not solely) what caused so many longtime subscribers to leave in the first place, and it's a pretty consistent pattern in the history of games as a service. You can take your playerbase for granted for a while, but not forever. So no, I don't have to do shit, because although I'll enjoy the product less it's still worth the subscription for me, and I have absolutely no reason to believe this will play out any differently than it usually does.
---
I appreciate your post, thougn; the willingness to deride all of Blizzard's critics as annoying and pointless on the basis of the most obnoxious ones is nostalgic in the same way Barrens chat is. So thanks for that.
---
Damn I must be yeeting my time away playing Stellaris or any other 4X Game that easily last a week..
---
Maybe the people that do enjoy it aren't the same people you see complaining. Play your way, and let others play their way.
---
literally doing god's work
---
I'm not sure whether that's true or not, but dang i couldn't watch that person from APES stream long than 10 min after their world first Rag kill. Extremely condescending and a major sense of superiority. Every answer he gave to questions in chat made him sound annoyed and as if everyone else but him was an idiot. All he could do was complain about vanilla wow too despite playing it all the time

Several million gold pieces huh? Maybe I should be a stone mason instead of a hero of the alliance...
---
Fighting defensively to the point where you're sacrificing offensive opportunities, like how a turtle ducks in its shell. Used more in the fighting game community, but still works here.
---
What‚Äôs funny is if people did the captains and capped the towers it would take 2x as long but be 3x the honor. So they‚Äôre actually being wildly inefficient. And now they‚Äôre all crying because horde actually *is* getting more honor when they lose because they‚Äôre accomplishing these objectives.
---
/u/relaxok 
---
&gt; Yeah i'm saying, I heard that this wasn't occurring in classic.. wondering if that's what was fixed
---
And I'm telling you that this can't have been what was fixed, because these buffs were not in vanilla, and thus were properly not included in classic.
---
Lol zug zug go to retail. Talking about shitty gameplay - How good was flight path camping us for weeks?
---
Nope soloq only
---
Yup a certain server had pre nerf av with the mines and everything, people still zerged and won in 7 min
---
No. Turning in the quests does.
---
You don‚Äôt get desert before you eat dinner.
---
Problem with that is, classic brought so many more people back. If they leave classic, they're not going to get those numbers back to retail.

My favourite is group finder in retail. You clearly can see what role everyone has (tank clearly missing) and title says "Need tank, ready to summon". Still random hunters and rogues just request to join to group.
---
I've come to decision that average player either can't read or is dumb.. or both.
---
Big chicken of doom with space lasers
---
Totally agree!
---
To Ninja'ing --&gt; it is very easy and if you plan on transferring anyway it is also cost free.
---
You can Change your Name with it if you like to. So no repurcutions :P
---
And trust me there are a lot of People that scummy... People will scam you out of 20g if they have the Chance. So they will certainly do it for 3-5k which is actually more than 1000$
---
*small indie company*
---
There is no race. Everybody that never missed bracket one once will get WF rank 14 simultaneously and anybody that did anything less won't. That ends up being dozens and dozens of people.
---
Everybody roll greed.
---
Is it crazy that this is the most exciting new feature for me since launch?
---
Dam Monday was one of the days I farmed honor.. this sucks balls
---
Imagine trying to gatekeep a snoozer battleground in a 15 year old game with a comment like this :']. 
---
People click on it not because they cant see the difference, they click on it since AV is such a doozie that you can play it while focussing on other stuff. Or because 20 people are standing on top of it...
---
Can you provide evidence that this was indeed a change in patch 1.7? Because I've been unable to find anything at all, so I'm curious how you're well aware of it. Just because patch 1.7 supported disabling the button does not mean that group AV queue was possible prior to that.
---
You must be seriously desperate for attention to spam this comment on threads.
---
üòÇ
---
I hope you mean working on your BiS list.
---
First it was 30 minute queues now it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOMG ITS THE FIRST DAY GOOD LUCK LOL‚Äù you guys are absolutely pathetic you sound like 6 year olds when they find out they‚Äôre wrong and need to find another excuse to save face.
---
While I agree with you that that particular syndrome of late-stage capitalism is very demoralizing and bad for the game industry as a whole I don't agree it's gonna solve itself just by voting with my wallet.
---
Especially with Classic, a game that goes against the trend of micro-transactions and trivialised Gameplay and indulges the idea of a traditional RPG-game. If anything we should keep supporting this game despite it's flaws to show them that games made with passion are more interesting than those with mobile-game aestethics.
---
I wouldn't know, I rolled pve to avoid that kind of toxicity.
---
How to win AV as Horde?
---
Welp. After the first night of AV, I think that's patently untrue. Horde love a good turtle. Will disrupt a Drek rush and drag out the game just to spite the alliance.
---
&gt;Its why we got arena
---
And that's why I prefer TBC over Vanilla, although Vanilla is it's own experience. Looking forward to TBC classic.
---
If you‚Äôre a ‚Äúpve player‚Äù you should have plenty of free time as raids only take 2-3 hours a week and there is nothing to do for the entire week. I don‚Äôt understand why you want battlegrounds to be as fast as possible
---
Hi,
---
I'm thinking about to starting to play classic, most likely as a healer for PVE content. But I'm unsure about what server to pick.
---
I know the difference between PVE and PVP servers and I like the world boss potential in PVP servers. But I don't want to be run over (and over, and over, and over again) while lvling...
---
So hit me up with what servers you recommend, both PVE and PVP on EU. If you got a feeling about the split horde / alliance it would be great, the last graph I saw was a couple of months old..
---
Also, if someone has a good argument to what healer I should play I'm all ears. Like which is the one most needed at 60 (in terms of both performance and how many that play the class). Priest is the only I have never healed as before. (Lvl 70+ content)
---
not really. content dries up really fast. 
---
very boring game if you're not employed
---
amazing, great job
---
They didn't add EXP to battlegrounds until around Cataclysm, if memory serves; so no.
---
Just to clarify he is speaking about new anniversary event which is different from queueing to normal AV.
---
Oh ok, I didnt know how that works. Thanks for that :)
---
Damn, why are Blizz always so backward. It's like they are doing this on purpose just to piss as many people as they can.
---
The real punishment is that they get more Honor for losing games.
---
Not if everyone else on your faction is also getting it. Lol
---
Dawww were your random predictions off?  Does that make you mad??
---
No, it has just been fixed in Classic as well along with the release of battlegrounds and all that.
---
My reccomendation is to search for another guild that suits you more as a player, theres nothing stopping you chilling with your friends in the guild outside of raid times but holding yourself to them just because "they are fun guys" seems like something that will burn you out in the long run.
---
But dont dog your boys make it clear youre leaving to not burn your bridges.
---
People gave you the wrong info. Nobody knew what would be coming and payed Transfers were a Thing in Vanilla.
---
It came mid 2006 while BC released early 2007. 
---
People ASKED for payed Transfers since day 1 when Blizzard fucked up the Servers and Groups of People got split up on different Servers with no means to swap because of 2347238947queues.
---
This is a way for Blizzard to redeem their mistakes and cash in on it even more.
---
But the world is not gonna end because of this like why is everyone on this Sub aways overexaggurating and saying this is the end of classic :d
---
Dude the beginning of BC did not have the resources.
---
maybe you should try to group with other level 39 twinks. 1 twink and 9 scrubs will not win you bgs!
---
Ngl that would be hilarious lol someone should make an add on
---
Blizzard tends to do bot bans in waves. It‚Äôs not incredibly effective. 
---
My bot story: I found a bot farming fire elementals. But at one point when I was trying to out tag him I noticed he was a shitty bot who kept killing mobs that I tagged. So I just used him as a farm slave.
---
As for lore, I'm not the most knowledgeable guy, so I'll leave that to others. Gameplay wise, I'd just recommend to start playing without a guide, trial and error. Sure, when you group up with people there will be an expectation that you somewhat know what you're doing, but you don't need to rush to that. I think you'll get the best the experience, the one many of us had 15 years ago, by just trying stuff out, and after that you can start looking at guides.
---
World pvp on a larger scale, aka southshore vs TM, gets boring really quick. So do AV turtles, when it's just mages spamming blizzard on either side. If you're a melee class you feel completely useless in those.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Oh look, its the comment complaining about posts complaining about people complaining.
---
The point is that this is the 1.12 version.
---
Not AV from 1.5, MC from 1.8, items from 1.1 and so on.
---
Article 13?! You violated Article 13?! Nice knowing you man, gg.
---
It was always only a matter of when it Releases.
---
I bet the first complaint was out before the first AV was finished worldwide xD
---
Could be, not was.  Was is revisionist history, or someone pretending to have played vanilla wow.
---
horde has now 1min queue for AV,
---
so right now its, 11h and not 130h
---
This was a fun read, cheers!
---
Without faction balance, horde is going to dominate TBC. Not worth it
---
It is. :)
---
Thanks for the info! I geuss I'll go into it blind then.
---
It was pretty similar with this one where it would attack for around 5 seconds or so and then just run back to the spot it started from, I started pulling the ones it had tagged away from it while killing my ones and it didn‚Äôt know how to react and just stood still
---
What is your ideal version of the sub? What kind of posts would you like to see on the front page?
---
Reference to Chestnutz ofc
---
If one person only pvped on saturday and another one only on Monday then the monday guy gets fucked and the saturday guy gets more rank than he should.
---
This is actually accurate.  It was possible to get the insanely long AVs but it was rare.  A couple hours?  Sure, that's normal.  12 + hours very rarely happened.
---
It always cracks me up how people just want to burn through content and then complain there‚Äôs nothing to do. There‚Äôs no progression in Classic beyond Classic. We‚Äôre only three months into a multi-year game here and everybody is acting like they‚Äôre ‚Äúbehind.‚Äù And in the process you‚Äôre ruining it for everyone who wants to actually experience ‚ÄúClassic,‚Äù not whatever this bastardized shitfest is that retail people have turned it into.
---
&gt; re you trying to argue that early AV wasn't significantly longer than the newer version in the later patches?
---
Nobody is arguing that.  They're arguing that calling it a regular multi-day event is hyperbole to the extreme.
---
There was also reports of being able to summon flag carriers.
---
And none of that from doing quests inside the place? Like handing over the looted items from bodies?
---
Lmao it does matter, some ppl might have not played at all on monday and others might have grinded as u said 9+ hours. Those ppl with 9+ hours would have gotten ahead.
---
It really is fucking annoying to play with them, believe me. I mean how are we supposed to communicate with our team
---
"Yeah, that... dude with the letter that looks like an A is the healer"
---
Can't wait until they nerf AV and people get thrown in to the matchmakingless pugs vs premades wsg grinder, and they'll hate that too
---
You constantly accrue reputation as you play the game. If you actually played a long enough match you‚Äôd notice.
---
Wasn't "Sorry I have to leave early" but our guildy went completely AFK during Sartarion +3. He came back about 2-3 hours later. Apparently he went AFK because his porch was on fire.
---
So Imagine you wouldn‚Äôt have to work. maybe you are not normal then ? Ooof
---
Find a new guild....
---
New meta, popping ony head for AV.
---
That was the point originally though. Honor was more from Wsg and AB, you did AV for the rep.
---
It's Blizzard.
---
They have repeatedly shown no interest in listening to opinions or voices of others, to the point where they openly silence hong-kong support in favor of keeping their chinese customers.  
---
Hell, even retail is evidence enough. It didn't become the shitshow it is today by Blizzard listening to the opinions of paying customers that keeps giving them money.
---
The keyring takes a bag slot?
---
Cookie's face be like: "The f*ck? Are we really doing this???" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Fucking badass!
---
&gt;Late stage TBC pvp is probably what most people actually remember liking.
---
Except for Warglaive Rogues XD
---
Lol you are just another one of those complainers about wow is dead.
---
Next you will complain about the People complaining! Like me :D
---
Just Play the game dude. On Reddit is seems like that but on my german Server there is plenty of People playing you just connect with the wrong People tbh.
---
Yes it has been minmaxing on private Servers too and still the game is a great game and it actually Comes down to skill even more when everyone is BIS geared.
---
Not the same - yes - but still Classic wow in the world of azeroth and not dead. Surely not. 
---
Just because you dislike it doesn't mean the same for all.
---
Get off of reddit - it really gives a bad Picture of wow
---
You need a /question macro when they try and poly you. It happens way to frequently.?
---
So sad that this is an accurate assumption.
---
What if he just Feign Deathed all this time?
---
Ratios are so 13 hours ago. We‚Äôre now bitching about AV taking 6 minutes. And soon we‚Äôre gonna start evolving into bitching that horde gets 2000 more honor then alliance despite losing cause they take the time to kill elite mobs.
---
I don't know if I'm not explaining myself well or if you don't try to understand what I'm saying but it feels like each time you avoid my point:
---
You can tell me that any of my ideas are bad if you have reasons to believe they are bad and I'm not pretending to be the one holding the truth or the right person to balance the game.  I also totally understand that some thing I'd like to see, some prefer not to have it and it's not a problem. 
---
However... stop using the 'it makes the game like retail' or 'it will spiral into terrible things' fallacies.
---
It's a fact that in Vanilla and nobody cleared MC until 5 months and even one year later, it was still quite an achievement and nowadays after only 3 monhts it's not. Like it's a fact that 1.12 is power creep and made the game easier. Now you can tell me: "I don't think it's a problem as I don't like to wipe on boss and I'm just here to mess around' you can tell me "yes it doesn't feel like Vanilla but who cares, it's classic and classic is easy PvE because everything is figured out' but don't tell me it's fuzzy memory to say that Classic PvE is easier than Vanilla.
---
And yes retail mindset isn't easier or harder: it's "pick your own difficulty from super-easy to super-hard" so as long as I'm not saying that BWL should have different difficulty mode, you can't tell me that it would be a change that would make classic feels like retail. If it would make the game feels like another version of WoW, it would be like Burning Crusade who had one difficulty level for raid and that difficulty was hard.
---
So again: you can disagree with me and say you like the game as it is but don't tell that change that aren't even similar to retail would turn the game into retail. In another words and to reuse your analogy: don't answer to people asking for more Dark Souls in Classic that it will turn the game into Animal Crossing, it's just non-sense.
---
It is, but AV is currently better honor, especially for solo players, and has better (and far more accessible) rep rewards. WSG is currently premades vs premades from what I heard, which means long matches.
---
What a load of wank

Well thank you! That is how we got retail. 
---
Give Classic 2-3 years of Reddit Moderation and you will be at retail again =)
---
would love for server transfers to come soon, I'd like to play with friends who got split up because a lot of people have different groups all starting different servers at launch :) would also be sweet if they added a horde-&gt;ally transfer, so we can have a little more balance - but that's just me
---
Just taking the piss sorry, I understand retail isn't what you're requesting :)
---
Prat broke for some things, but the chat still works fine. ArkInventoryClassic also has some odd errors
---
If the players wanted to pvp in it they would pvp. Instead they want to minmax honor farming.
---
Better grind rep now, queues will drastically increase once everyone is exalted, I guess?
---
Wtf? That isnt deathrolling. That isnt even normal rolling.
---
You pick a bet for example 20g. Then you roll for 10 times that number as your max. The next guy rolls for whatever you got as their new max. Then you roll again for what they got as max. Until one of you rolls a 1.
---
For example:
---
A: 30g bet
---
B: ok go
---
A: /Roll 300 --&gt; 176
---
B: /Roll 176 --&gt; 54
---
A: /roll 54 --&gt; 12
---
B: /Roll 12 --&gt; 2
---
A: /roll 2 --&gt; 2
---
B: "fckn hell"
---
B: /roll 2 --&gt; 1
---
B now gives A 30g.
---
B now gives A 30g
---
dont think an item with that name exist ingame
---
And that would double or even triple the time spent diminishing the hourly rate. The vast majority of people queuing right now just want the quick win because they expect a nerf/hotfix to how fast they're played out.
---
yeah the MC progress is frigging exhausting, finally the AV rep items are here, so we can make it past Garr....... oh man
---
That may be true for some servers but not all. There were plenty of 4 hours games on K1 right up until the end. Now, on K1 you only got AV to pop one wekeend every 3 weeks so that may have had something to do with it
---
Negative.  I'll be doing most of my honor farming in this BG.  I probably won't spend much time at all in the others, unless they bring back bonus weekends.
---
It constantly tells me that "I am not in a raid group" while in AV. Does anyone know why this happens? The text doesn't seem to be from an addon.
---
Just my opinion man - if you really want to a guide, I suggest heading over to [wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com), there should be something like what you're looking for. Either way, I hope you enjoy the game!
---
Is it fast to get honored reputation as a horde? My hunter really desires those ice-threaded arrows.
---
Is Vancleef's gravel voice hot to anybody else?
---
Well they probably did, just not at first.  They don't seem to be doing progressive anything in classic.
---
Unprecedented.
---
You're probably just roaming in the wrong places. You can see it during things like world bosses etc, horde generally always have a stronger showing, especially at Azuregos.
---

I am a human fury warrior with edgemaster's who happen to win deathbringer, should I aim for a second DB or a CHT/Brutality Blade for OH
---
Lame as fuck
---
&gt;... and we can make that happen if we work together as a community. 
---
sory dont want to be be mean but do you even read this subreddit sometimes yourself?  there was some sort of "community" before p2 - now whats left are min/max BiS nolifers who will report and kick you in an AV while you are in combat because you delay it by having pvp skirmishes .. do you really think what you proposed is anywhere close to reasonable ?
---
Its just as you say. People had this idea of the hardest and funniest version of the game ever, and it wasn't hard back then (at least not for me) but it was a lot of fun. But the problem lies in the fun part that is like a book that you read a long time ago, and you are reading again, and even if you forgot many parts of the book, you still know how its going to end.
---
Thins like this is what makes me point that most of the players complain on things that they don't even understand. Like the quest log in retail. Many people complain about how quests are trivial in retail and look like a chore, but they "forget" that back then everyone was downloading carbonite, and now questie, and back then was thottbot. We also don't play with single digit fps anymore (ffs, you can run classic in a cellphone!!!). In fact, our computers could put in shame the mainframes of that time.
---
Lets face it. The game was crappy mess back then, but it was fun, and gave us everything what we dreamed and more, also part of the fun was figuring out that mess. But now we know how the book is going to end, and we already did the puzzle (or know the answer at least).
---
TL;DR: Stop blaming blizz and start blaming the players.
---
This is what AV is all about. Grats!
---

Id be more interested in Don Julios
---
Kodos are actually super useful in some places. Due to bigger hitbox tauren on kodo doesn't get dismounted in some waters (fellwood horde FP for example. You can jump over it in some places, but our taurens just pass that river. Tested it out while RP walking to craft our first Rhok'delar).
---
It should be.   I‚Äôd like to know if it‚Äôs better then the dire maul north ring x 2 for rogues Pve.
---
Experienced exactly the same thing.. I assumed it was TSM bugging, as it said it had to re-cache items but took forever. Then left for work. But I went from 90+ usually to 20-30 this morning
---
&gt;you‚Äôre just stuck getting worse honor than the other faction
---
That isn't how that works
---
Probably not, since they are a stackable item.
---
Go to settings advance settings and make sure it's using the correct card and not auto detect
---
Is that some kind of unspoken agreement between both factions so they can grind rep as fast as possible? Just wondering why it isn't possible to defend or whatever.
---
Sorry for the stupid question but I've never played Vanilla or AV, just wondering.
---
It doesn't matter what Blizzard does, people are going to bitch.  I'm just confused why the people who have been complaining for 6 months are still playing.
---
Thank you a bunch, that worked for me after a restart!
---
So, what phase are we in now? 2.5? BG's are out, but BWL is not?
---
No updates from blizzard on when to expect the loot table changes?
---
So, how fast do you get  reputation in these 7-10 minute games?
---
my mans a clicker
---
If you're getting an error message constantly popping up, it's gotta be from an addon that thinks you're in a raid and keeps trying to do something.
---
And it has begin!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8w8g2/people_who_played_on_private_servers_is_this_a/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8x0ee/this_version_of_av_suuuuucks/
---
It's more people are aware and grind their pre-raid BiS before even hitting 60 and now have a much better understanding of how to play. People don't go into MC with whatever shit quest gear with int and agility and try to pyroblast molten giants anymore.
---
Land of the free!!!
---
You'll have to define can't, because it's apparently very different than my definition.
---
The difference is, they earned nothing with whining. But the horde already destroyed a server with their min maxin toxicity.
---
Guys do the speed bonus stack up? Line can i go with mithril spurs + carrot + riding skill on gloves?
---
Alliance AV is instant.
---
As long as we dont have to play with the french
---
Winning is more rep
---
All NA servers are in one group, so I'd assume the same for EU. Tried some AV yesterday (in the hours after the server went up), queue times for Horde were mostly instant, sometimes longer (never over 3 minutes). Id expect potentially longer queue times once the initial hype dies down, however with the big battle groups it shouldn't be an issue for a long while. For Alliance, I'd expect the queues to be even shorter, as the overall Alliance population is lower.
---
Gnome. I got rank 13 in vanilla as gnome warrior. Escape artist with the PvP ticket makes a huge difference Vs mages etc
---
Wow, that solved all the FPS problems. Good catch! I feel stupid now haha. Thanks!
---
Ohh noes how horrible. Not like these people who grinded on Monday only would make it to any good rank at all.
---
Well, my ideal version of the sub is far different from any realistic version of the sub: there'd be no memes, for one, and I get not everyone is me and like memes. But there are changes I'd suggest.
---
For starters I'd like to see criticism that's a little less toxic. Ideally it would be primarily constructive, but I'm a realist. Right now the complaint posts that get heavily upvoted are 70 percent vitriol and 10 percent circlejerking, which is a shame because there's some really valid stuff in the other 20 percent. Stuff like putting a cooldown on rehashing the same topics as submissions tends to rein that sort of thing in.
---
Rules against low effort content tend to reduce clutter as well. The bottom line is that a lot of what's in the sub feed right now is drowning out people who actually want to talk about the game itself. To be clear, that's fine; not everyone **wants** to read a breakdown of steps Blizz can take to reduce faction balance because they're on a PvE server or their personal balance is fine. But the only time those posts get any significant traction at the moment is if they're downright venomous, and that's bad on several levels.
---
Is it really as bad as all the complainer posts tho?  
---
Alliance wins 90% and matches take 5-10 minutes?
---
If I do several AVs a week getting lots of honor, do I still need 15 HKs in case they don't happen in AV to get a rank the following week?
---
it is yes, 1% crit &gt;
---
In 3.0, as planned. I think it's expected around January, but I'm not sure where the rumor is coming from.
---
Hunters will come for pyro then peace the fuck out after they don't get truestrike. So many times.
---
Have a little think about what you've asked and why people might have been looking forward to getting the key ring.
---
LOL this is so true.
---
Well they dont
---
10 minutes av ?:D
---
You think you want it but you don't
---
i like it :)
---
&gt; The only thing that will solve this is when the tryhard minmaxers finally get bored and go back to retail, and leave the community to us diehard graybeards.
---
All the tryhard minmaxers are mostly old pserver vets who've been playing 1.12 for years. Them going 'back to retail' would require a time machine.
---
It really depends on what you want to do. With this guild you will maybe clear BWL at some point, but you will never kill Cthun. Do you want to clear the newest content or not. If this is worth more than the fun you have, hanging around with others, you should change.
---
They should understand.
---
You should never blame the players for something like that. If the incentives make the players act a certain way, then the problem is with the incentives. Maybe it wasn't as apparent back then or maybe it worked because people played differently. I don't think you can say that the failing is with the players though, if anything, its just a mismatch between incentives and playerbase. You could easily design a BG where people acted the way you wanted, by just changing the incentives.
---
Yea matches are super fast, unless one side decides to turtle for some reason. But quick matches are best honor/rep per hour even if you lose so it's in everyone's interest to rush and avoid actual PVP.
---
Dunno about the actual winrate, I only had time for one match before I went to work, I think my friends are having a good time in there, I'll ask what their winrate is looking like atm.
---
Lure single players into the keep (Mind Control with a Priest being the best way), so they aggro Drek'Thar with his adds, and pull him outside while their raid gets ready.
---
yes, pretty much this
---
This is actually partially true.  It was a failed experiment though.  The queue system was effectively broken, and nobody used it until much later in the wrath expansion.  You had to travel to the dungeon and click it to get into the q, which took forever, and most of the time failed to produce appropriate groups. In BC they changed the stones to act as summoning stones, which never existed in vanilla.
---
I hope they wait with fixing it until people with jobs also had a chance to farm easy honor/rep, not only the no-lifers.
---
How did this even happen? Just zerg to the end like in retail? What is even the point.
---
I play a HPala on a PvE server and I don't regret my decision at all, although I have to admit I didn't participate in any World Boss kills yet. WPvP on a PvP server is just ganking a player on a lower level and/or ganking players outnumbered for 95% of the time, so unless you are into that, just roll PvE.
---
On my server (Everlook EU, Alliance), Holy Paladins seem to be in demand the most for raids groups (not just among healers, but in general). I've also seen several guilds looking for Resto druids, though I'm sure a Dwarf priest should eventually find a spot as well. 
---
Keep in mind that playing Pala means you will just spam FoL 90% of the time, its basically the frost mage amongst healers. I'm totally fine with that, but its certainly not for everyone. Also, the Paladin is the slowest among the alliance healers to level with.
---
This seems like shit honor if you ignore *all* objectives. Getting a couple towers and a captain would give twice as much even if you lose. But this is the best rep grind for alliance it seems.
---
Why don't you just play the game at your own pace, rather than following the tide of rushers?
---

Lol geuss I'll be a cute little puppy then. Thanks for the info!

Well fuck

Human here - 385 rep per win + 110 per 3x token hand in = 495 rep per win. 45k rep required, ~90 games with no other contributions. Quests and handing in armor scraps etc. all give rep, so it's much less than 90, but that's the math.
---
To add to this:
---
Inventors focal from your solo maraudon farm.
---
Witchblade.
---
Dagger of the new moon from the many DM W runs you will likely do.
---
Rod of the ogre magi
---
All of these are fine.
---
If it is not contested, I suggest you free up 25-30 bag slots and farm the Sky Shadow bird mobs in Deadwind pass. Their loot table includes an  8s feather, a 12s wing, a 17silver writing tool, a 19s egg and other 1-2s vendor items.
---
You should be able to get 20-25g per hour (if you are the only one farming).
---
&gt; But I'm the tank...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Edit: I am lvling a shammy tank alt with some stronk BoE gear, consumes and enchants. Not sure if I can recommend using rockbiter and high rank ES without shield and some decent gear and or defensive talents.
---
/salute 
---
Im a shaman raid tank myself and just finished tanking MC, such an amazing feeling :) If you have any questions, let me know.
---
Exactly. People are treating this just like retail AV where everyone ignores each other and just rushes to the bosses. It's pathetic. It's ruining the pvp experience for everyone who signed up to play real matches and honestly this is why I won't be resubbing to classic; everyone is playing it as if it were retail and it has become simply not fun.
---
some of these casuals never crafted a nature rune and it fucking shows
---
One just plays for the loot and one plays for the fun.
---
I don't quite get the uber min-maxers.
---
So you grind out all your AV and honor rep in a week. Get all the gear upgrades. Then the AV content is 'complete'.
---
Great, then what?
---
IMO they're the reason that the Classic schedule has been so accelerated. They smash through the content to fill out a mental checkbox then sit around and wait for the next bit of content. Then they'll go through that as quickly as possible, whereever possible not engaging in the content at all.
---
But in the meantime, players who don't want to play like that are forced into their shitty playstyle.
---
Those same people will cry in a month when they dont have anything to do.
---
Yes the reset, but usually the raids gathers in the entrance, which counts as indoors. As long as there are people in that area, the boss and adds will attack them. To reset the boss, it needs a coordinated move out of the entrance into the open field. Also, each person killed will like spawn in the tunnel all the way north, because all graveyards are tapped.
---
R14?
---
People are too focused now on rushing to the end and trying to be a badass. The community is dead.
---
The vote with your wallet only goes so far until it hits the point that the only people paying are the ones that enjoy the trend a game is going,, and while we may think the company wasn‚Äôt listening when they were, that crowd that are still the ones paying will have the say of where it goes - pushing it farther into the area that a dissatisfied  ex-player wouldn‚Äôt want to see.
---
This company does listen, are we so short-sighted that we forget the only reason this game is a possibility is because they listened?
---
Wholesome. Take my upvote, guy
---
Whats the difference between this one and the other AVs? Just curious.
---
Yeah the playerbase has become terrible tbh.
---
Ye there you have it :P
---
I have gotten item drops in AV, so I assume so. Also got a pristine black diamond or whatever.
---
Exalted with which race? Sorry I'm new
---
Which is also the reason why Retails is what Retail is now. And then people start Bitching that everything is to easy.
---
Does it have to? This is the AV I remember from all throughout TBC. The only thing different is pvp ranks.
---
Becoming stronger for PvP
---
And people downvoted the shit out of me when I pointed this out; that the social aspect has gone and everyone has turned into retail assholes again.
---
Frostwolf Clan (Horde) or Stormpike (Alliance). Rewards are a couple epic items, including very good rings for melees and caster.
---
"Hey I'm problems, and I have white."
---
One just wants the gear for himself thats why he wants it nerfed so he can run his wsg premades
---
Yes on man speaks for an entire faction. Pathetic
---
Clever kid.
---
Exalted? You get reputation from AV?
---
Missed hitting R7 this week because of it.
---
‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt affect me then it must not be a big deal!‚Äù
---
Sit down.
---
I mean, buying a warden staff for one boss fight and speccing as a warlock tank before the boss is even out is pretty neche lol
---
I wouldn't worry about Vael at all, if at all Razorgore might pose a bigger issue for casual guilds. Vael was a guildbreaker 15 years ago, now he wont be a issue at all i believe, its a patchwork type of boss that didn't age well imho. 
---
For the i think its hard to make a recommendation, it all depends on what you like.
---
For example i'm playing with ppl i played with 15 years ago, we started with +-20 raiders, killed ony with 20 players, started MC with 20 players and are up to rag now with +-30 ppl in raid. Which i feel is a lot of fun. 
---
The first Ony kill in greens and blue's (we didn't chase pre-bis or everything) was actually a lot of fun, doing MC bosses with 20 ppl is a lot more fun (imho) than with 30+ which makes them mosty pushovers. The most wipes we had on a MC boss before a kill was like 3 wipes and that was with 20 undergeared players. 
---
I wouldn't like a first rag without doing the sons phase imho, it was a important part of the fight back in the day and i would pretty sad to miss that. Pre sons kills will come later anyway. 
---
I'd say if you like the challenge maybe stay with the current, but do inform them that you have some issues with way things are going.
---
If you like fast runs without a lot of challenge i'd say maybe switch guilds to a guild that provides that experience.
---
Im not a ¬´nochanges¬ª player actually, but classic is supposed to be harder, things are supposed to take longer and there will always be downsides to almost anything. This is what differs classic to retail. People like you made retail, a shit version where no1 needs patience for anythin, can level from 1-120  and be full epic gared in 1 day.
---
This isn't just disapproval, you're personally attacking me and questioning my motives for wanting people to be less angry around here. I want that partially because I think Blizzard would be more likely to listen if this place was a little less toxic, but mostly because communities that are angry in this particularly way tend to contribute to a phenomenon called risky drift, where the opinions and emotions expressed get more and more extreme till they're completely disconnected from reality. It's not emotionally healthy, and it can lead to antisocial behavior.
---
Same here but with my girlfriend. Though I only said "got to go, emergency"
---
Not saying that you‚Äôre wrong but... Many players don‚Äôt want a fix.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not like the community was all ‚Äúplease Blizzard! create a new version of AV and honor system so we haven‚Äôt incentives to rush everything‚Äù
---
Also we wont use it for that fight
---
December 9th* but yeah, we've been noticing it on our server too (eu)
---
Pah. The nobles betrayed him and that is why he murders many innocent people.. He isn't morally grey, he became a monster after their betrayal!
---
Nice picture.
---
this. the honor per hour/rep grind has been great, but for some reason alliance keep fucking wiping on drek, and then turtling because they didnt wait for GY/rezzes. sooo annoying.
---
Or German in WSG. That used to mean instaquit for half the team opposing them
---
The cleaverist!
---
ReTaIl PlAyEr DuMb Xdeeeeeeeee

You don‚Äôt get the item back probably.
---
So original...
---
Try again..  
---
this time with some feeling. ü§£
---
I do think OG AV now would be somewhat less fun since people do so much more dps now. It's way faster and flashier, less room for errors. Including all the side quests.
---
I've never seen any of the dal'rend blades drop in my few UBRS runs, but I've seen those truestrike shoulders twice.
---
My advice is to only farm the dal'rends if you have a dedicated group that doesn't mind doing only rend runs. You can do it with less than 10 people too!
---
Dal'rend's has a similar damage range with Krol Blade, so I don't think your sinister strikes will lose too much damage.
---
Stick with whichever you get first imo. I'd prioritise the epic mount first, then get the Krol.
---
Cheers!
---
What was your xp per/h in SM?
---
no
---
Way to go my man! Interactions like that is what made us love the game in the first place! Thank you for sharing and best of luck with all the irl bullshit!!!
---
Yet you still can't do it.
---
Imagine it like this, you and 50 other people are employed by the same company for paid by the hour work. You and 24 other employees are scheduled to work Monday and Tuesday while the other 25 worked Wednesday through Friday. On the following Wednesday you all get your paychecks, except you and the 24 employees who worked Monday and Tuesday get nothing, while the other 25 get paid for 3 days of work.
---
How is that not a problem?
---
Shut up
---
And the 3rd Reich is the result of political changes in 1930s germany... does that mean we should avoid all changes because the Fuhrer will arise again?
---
Or get good team mates, healers that want to do shit need protection or literal god pvp skillz.
---
You don‚Äôt keep it on once you get close to battle. ItemRack makes it easy to change gear sets. I‚Äôm new to WoW in general and I can‚Äôt get by without ItemRack as a Druid. I have a cat poweshifting set, cat dps set, bear tank set, car dps, stealth set, mount set, and 1 other Shadowcraft set all setup. It only changes the items you set it to, so when I click on the mount set (or you can make it auto-change when mounting) it only changes my trinket and boots with spurs. Then I can use whatever set I want before I get to the battle. A bit more work for a small gain, but I use a non-epic mount and I can still almost stay at speed with the epic mounts.
---
Nice brightness
---
This happened quite a bit in retail as well. I remember complaints of no content in *Wrath of the Lich King* and *Mists of Pandaria* because people cleared the final raids rather quickly then the next major content was an expansion pack. People should take a break from WoW if they beat all the current content and have nothing to do but there's a big social element that keeps them logging in.
---
Yeah there just isn't a join as group button for AV, you can try and time the "join" click with discord but there are often like.. 100 AV's at once so the chances of getting into the same one are not great.
---
Also weirdly I keep getting the queue faster than my buddy, and so have been waiting an extra 5 seconds, and I will still get the queue first, not sure if they try some class balancing or something but it's wacky
---
hey if you wana fawk im available
---
Aside from the obvious of holidays and off weekend days off in many industries, the truth is also that alternative / flexible schedules are becoming more and more common. Personally I could never work a 9 to 5.
---
At the top of my head I simmed OEB at something like 30-40 DPS higher than BRE on a single target boss fight for my pre-BIS orc warrior with some world buffs, so the OEB weapon skill is significant. That said logic dictates BRE is infinitely much better for cleave or fast kills where you can't armor debuff your target. Instances, trash, add fights, or PVP.
---
No, most will just keel complaining ü§£
---
Cuz orcs when walks always look at the floor, almost.
---
How does this even work? You just can't join their premades? 
---
We used to just solo queue as twinks, or queue as like 5 if enough friends were online. Why would a randomer blacklisting my twink even matter?
---
nice video! Caperfin here.
---
Im the author of the guide talked about in the video. **https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150**
---
If anyone has questions send them my way. I've also raid tanked successfully as a warlock, priest, rogue, hunter, etc...
---
i got honored tnight
---
You remember people playing organically because at that time the game was still evolving and players were experiencing these things for the first time. You can‚Äôt make a puzzle that‚Äôs been solved a mystery again. 
---
People know which items are optimal and what they have to do to get them, and they are going to do those things with dogged efficiency put of a desire to ‚Äúdo it right‚Äù and get all the things they missed or failed to achieve the first time. Its inevitable.
---
Besides which, there are probably a lot of players like me that have no actual interest in battlegrounds but who are being pressured into grinding by guild BiS requirements. Believe me, I would love to leave you all to your epic battles, but if I don‚Äôt do this then I don‚Äôt get to dps Blackwing Lair. Competition for raid spots is fierce and sadly the BiS list demands that I have that stupid ring. 
---
So until I have the stupid pvp currency to buy Don Julios I‚Äôm gonna be here in your queue hoping for a fast damn match so I can go back to doing stuff I actually like.
---
AV gear was all at the quarter master last night. Just need the rep to buy!
---
Also looking for one.  If anyone knows and posts to op, could you tag me as well please?
---
LFG at 23:00, corpse crawl in P2 to entrance at 23:30, start clearing 00:00 because a party member dropped in lava and doesn‚Äôt know how to get up to BRD so ress sickness and corpse crawls again, finish clearing at 1:30 with a couple wipes, HS, sell junk and go to bed 2:00, can‚Äôt stop thinking about your preraid BiS at 2:30, wake up at 6:00, go to work, do adult stuff and repeat. 
---
Anybody else a tad sleep deprived?
---
What do you think was removed that is causing this? The communication change is completely unrelated to all of the taint we are seeing.
---
Ayee thanks
---
The grind is what it is, people will always do their best to find a way to do it faster and easier, that's human nature. 
---
If rushing Drek and killing him in 7 minutes awards the highest honor per hour, then that is what people will do.
---
Than that means they will have something to do if they will play and keep complaining.
---
Thats funny.. we asked for classic and all classic was. We got it. Now choose, classic or retail, simple as that
---
At least Ashitgold admits he gets carried through SM for loot
---
Sadly Actiblizz won't do anything, they need that free streamer advertisement.... Most people who play are just second fiddle to them, they don't care.
---
I  happen to be a druid, so stealthing around isnt bad.
---
It's fun running around WPL 1v1ing horde players, and winning most of the time, they really dont know how to pvp if it is even odds. On my warrior though, without stealth, you just get zug zugged by 20 horde.
---
Not concerned about myself, just want people to play with not bail ship. 
---
Stop being a scrub man, if you wanted pvp, real pvp. then you'd want even servers
---
This is what happens when you open mix all tue servers!  Back to just a face in the crowed.
---
people abusing report on retail were actioned w/ suspensions
---
Hi, it‚Äôs called trinketmenu
---
blizzards pretty garbo ya
---
Ofcourse that's a thing. Man oh man.
---
Because I can fix the terrible blind ranking system by using HonorSpy.
---
People can't learn to just appreciate what we have, and have FUN. People in this game does seem to play to have fun.
---
twitch will do something too get together with ppl hes doing this too and mass report
---
Nah man, I‚Äôm seriously having the most fun I‚Äôve had playing video games ever.   Av games that take like 50 minutes are seriously bringing me so much joy,  I ducking love it.   I wanna play to have fun, this Zerg Meta is dumb.
---
I'll make it my life's goal to prolong every AV i'm in as much as possible.
---
so, one of the best race class combos in the game?
---
Lol not false
---
He doesn't know the site has been renamed years ago?
---
So called pvp-er trying to have good pvp ranks don't enjoy pvp. In the outside world, they'll only grief low level players that can't retaliate or gang 5v1, and in PVP battlegrounds, they will avoid the ennemy as more as possible or even let him win if that mean more honor
---
Because it's a service that's been available in the game for 13 years, including during vanilla. It's not being offered as a solution to the imbalance issue, it'll be open to everybody for any reason they wish.
---
Hey all, I'm glad someone made a post regarding this, it appears some items may not be available until later phases, I found this video from Quissy to be quite informative, although keep in mind it was indeed produced just prior to release of Battlegrounds. Although I have still found the majority of information to be accurate;
---
https://youtu.be/sgXDYvlEH-o
---
This. No one is saying you have to follow the train to the enemy base.
---
Blizzard don't moderate abuse of this on live. Literally 0 chance they will on classic. Stay safe is another garbage steamer who can't play for shit.
---
Quests and mobs give exp in AV. You can enter at level 51.
---
That's about right.
---
Im sure you took things in your own pace! And that‚Äôs great :) but honestly since you are only 46 there‚Äôs a reason you can still enjoy it, When phase 2 hit if you were below 60 but above 48 you‚Äôd get killed so many times because you were worth homie.. you can‚Äôt rly say questing is easy in plenty of zones, you haven‚Äôt experienced the real struggle, but dw as alliance you probably will still be corpse camped once you are actually worth any honor
---
Honor, not rep.
---
Would have been quicker to kust answer yes or no pal. Also nik ta m√®re
---
Reported for streamsniping or what?
---
Holy SHIT you‚Äôre a king! 
---
I was at 20fps scratching my head, knowing it had something to do with the patch. Now I‚Äôm at 100. 
---
Thank you so much
---
If they do them it means they still think its a fun thing to do.
---
They could do a billion other things yet they choose to zerg av.
---
Are you kidding? After the clusterfuck that is AV, I'm thinking to myself "at least they won't / can't ever fuck with twinking." Expect a massive twink revival in Classic. 
---
Playing as a twink against other twinks is also some of the best fun I've ever had in the game. 
---
Some twinks are super hardcore and I've stayed in touch with some people in the community even though Blizz killed them in retail.
---
Is farming salt an effective way to make gold?
---
True... Vanilla was made awesome by the players, the Classic community is toxic as hell
---
True Vanilla AV according to *you*. This is also a true version of AV from Vanilla.
---
PVP in WoW is all trash until at least TBC anyway. At least in AV you can get your rewards quickly without having to subject yourself to too many encounters with vanilla class design/balancing.
---
Then i will stand my ground and aoe those filthy hords down
---
playing defense is fun and one way to win ! wish more ppl did it
---
Yeah mine does this too.  If you holster your weapon and cycle thorugh them, it fixes iteself though.

I'm a warlock and I have a 24 slot "soul bag" that holds 24 soul shards. Everyone has a main backpack + 4 other bags. I have the backpack + THREE bags + my soul bag (which can ONLY hold soul shards). So I literally have one less bags than other classes do AND I have been carrying around keys. The fact that it is 24slots does NOT in ANY way make bag space any "more convenient" for me outside of being able to have more soul shards on me at a time.
---
My server is called Lucifron
---
Just go to twitch and Update them, worked like a charm for me last night
---
1/10000
---
what reasons would there be
---
Dungeon healer here - Can confirm! (Married, sock owner)
---
Had to renew my sub 3 days ago to try BGs. Last sub I‚Äôll have though.
---
Living also need key to the city never take the fron entrance.
---
Unsubbing from the game at this point. This is ridiculous. Vanilla AV is what I was looking forward to most all these years... and this is what we get. I am BEYOND disappointed. This is it. Very, very, very done wasting my time hoping Blizzard will do something right for a change. They can't be bungling this by complete accident this much and this badly.
---
they named a server Mankirk and it is not pvp... "confused peon" ...Zug zug?
---
Lol they put in nerfed AV and decided to nerf it some more.
---
This reply seems like that child game "mirror mirror"....?
---
Nowhere I said "this better than that", you do realize that, right?
---
Not during this phase.
---
i'll slap my mom somethin else if she doesnt have my hot pockets ready before raid time
---
Just like classic. Not the most skillfull players are rewarded, just the ones with the most free time on hands.
---
And this is a game design challenge, when half the group doesn't want to play the game. 
---
But it should get better when most people got their honor in a few weeks.
---
The nochanges people arent really to blame here, it's blizz starting us off on a patch that is way too late in vanilla for any of the content to be at ALL relevant or progress oriented. Nochanges was for the spirit of the early releases, not the late.
---
zerg to lose to maximize honor grind to gain rank to get gear to zerg lose more efficiently?
---
no thanks, if they can't handle me back capping and forcing a turtle they can go resource zerg on retail
---
That's pretty toxic. Its unfortunate to notice a pattern of toxicity in player behaviour, in the previous patch the toxicity of gankers is what killed an entire server.
---
Especially considering this was supposed to be the game with the good community and all...
---
420
---
1) that info isn‚Äôt new
---
2) that info is drastically out of date
---
3) paid transfers are here and no one gives a shit cos cross realm bgs are here 
---
4) typing this article would have taken time, you better have been waiting for a queue to pop.
---
Was about to say one in a million when I realised you were right. Doesn't matter what the first person rolls.
---
There is an addon that syncs everyone's queue button up so everyone joins the queue at the same time, 95% of the time it'll put everyone in the same battleground.
---
Why play at all if this is your attitude toward the game? Literally what is the point if you dont want to play the content, just get rewards that will be utterly pointless? What is the point in getting all that rep and gear if you dont intend to use it for this same endgame content?
---
I mean premade 40 vs 40 rashuing can't be the optimal strategy right?
---
Used to do this when I played a disc priest in TBC. With my resilience gear I could fearbomb and wipe all but the largest groups on last boss, great fun :)
---
I love that this is happening all over again
---
Skyrim joke
---
0.0001% or 1 in 10,000.
---
This sucks... I was looking forward to AV, because my memories of Vanilla AV were huge zergs that lasted for days.
---
I don't ever recall 5 minute rush wins being a thing ever - perhaps very late into Vanilla?
---
3.3k xp per win (3 marks) it seems. Not great XP/hour by any means, but pretty effortless and you get rep/honor at the same time.
---
The odds are:
---
100/(100*100*100)=1/10.000
---
That's some crazy odds!!
---
Because players tell themselves "i can have fun after the grind" the grind never stops. Or when it does they'll get bored and quot lol
---
People reported me afk cos I wasn't with the zerg ball
---
Because Asmon plays for longer.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure.
---
I joined an AV yesterday with zero add one and was in the game but not in a group and upon leaving (turtle match) I did not receive deserter
---
Does anyone know the costs of the exalted rewards from AV? Can‚Äôt find a source anywhere.
---
this version of av is basically the retail version of av, which is shitty as f\*ck  
---
in the original av it was near impossible to kill generals, even with a single tower up  
---
now people just run in in blues and kill the sh\*t out of vandar / drek
---
Na man, this just insane. You provide valid points and people just give u bs responses.
---
OP is not complaining ABOUT paid serber transfers. They were in the game and they can be. No one has a prob with that
---
But in the current state of faction balance, transfers will make imbalance worse because everyone just swaps if they are the lower faction. Also it risks ruining the balanced servers AND on top of that they see an opportunity to charge you for a 15 year old game? The same amount as for a  current game (retail)???? Thats outrageous!
---
Classic is an OLD game. Old rehashed code. Nothing more. And thats sad, at least some fking management to make shit like imbalance better. Fking come up with something, you multibillion conglomerate. Jesus fking christ and the people not seeing the fault in this? 
---
That smartass above me whos like, it was fun I had my fun now Im done. Yeah ok fkoff. Unsub
---
Excuse my french but it is my culture.
---
But didn't he quit? Media whore...
---
How fast is that? Does it count as an epic mount?
---
Fkoff
---
Better than half the content on this sub.
---
+1 I laughed
---
Alright, seems pretty decent. Thanks for the reply!
---
Rogue here, I want the off hand dagger please.
---
"Water is wet. Change my mind"
---
&gt; I'm just going to throw this out there. I played on an RP server in vanilla, and with RP tends to come a bit more.. creativity with builds. So we had a melee hunter. Now let me tell you, as a healer at the time, I would have preferred to just 4man places instead of take him anywhere. I'd rather have literally any other class/spec, it's just an extra person doing next to nothing who also needs healing. If you want to have fun by all means, but make sure you're minimizing the impact to other peoples' fun because you want to memespec.
---
You played with a melee hunter who obv did no put any effort to make it work. A melee hunter's dps can get really high if the appropriate amount of effort is put into it. I've played as a melee hunter and constantly compete against ranged hunters.
---
It's sad really - min/maxxers trying to maximise their gear for what exactly... what are they using it for. An endless pursuit of better numbrs, without actually using it for any purpose (i.e. PvP)
---
Sunlight hurts eyes, halp
---
It's an bug that's always been in the game for as long as I can remember. Funny to see it's still around.
---
Considering how big Classic is it really is sad how little effort Blizz puts into it
---
For him it‚Äôs actually not free. He actually get‚Äôs paid for it because he is a streamer with huge amounts of viewers.
---
AV was always a PVE race
---
it just used to be a lot slower
---
But theres no reason to win. 
---
In fact theres incentive to lose rather than have the game draw itself out
---
i saw someone start a mara full run at midnight ... i was like "good luck with that, i am off to bed"
---
None of this applies to me, but okay
---
Why are you like this?
---
This'll get nerfed pretty fast - at least the Honor part of it. I predict a 50% reduction in AV bonus honor by next week's reset.
---
And I‚Äôm sitting here wanting paid race changes :(
---
Sorry I'm not gonna spend 6 hours on this, gonna need a timestamp.
---
Can confirm that, saw a guy in Ironforge this evening with the Stormpike tabard.
---
Protip. Your can skip the bridge. Once the horde figure that out, alliance will never win.
---
go south, all they need to understand
---
He had all of his viewers mass report him for killing him in a video game, and bringing to light his terrible stuff he does like ninja looting. I don't care for him either way, but to be fair I watched some of his videos, and it looks like he does go kill him a lot, but he documents how he finds him each time as proof against a stream sniping claim.
---
Yes.
---
From what I've heard and seen, mobs outside deadzone or melee and mobs out of LOS have a smaller chance of resisting FD.
---
The spirits can also resist FD which will keep you in combat even if the king and the caster run for your pet.
---
I'm currently waiting on my deserter debuff to be removed after being report spammed out of an AV because the people from one server don't like people from my server.
---
Would be nice for that to have some repercussions but I doubt it.
---
I know druids are great against frost mages, but what about fire mages?
---
Is there even group queuing for AV?
---
Killing balinda and the elite mobs.
---
They actually (short time) ban for it btw. Sadly enough, i think all of these methods are great to filter out mouthbreathers.
---
Precalling it now: you're wrong. 
---
The people that are ranking quickly learn who each other and start grouping with each other. They do this to make their honor grind easier while also blocking bracket busters from busting it. 
---
If you were not invited to your server's top honor farm group today and haven't been queuing all day in mostly premades, you are not hitting rank 14 this calendar year.
---
Gold farming is a problem though for healers, at least for me as a Paladin without any tanking gear to farm lashers or run Strat reserving orbs.
---
For this reason I'm leveling a hunter right now.
---
If you're confused, that's Balinda, a captain in AV that most horde raids rush instead of going for the final boss.
---
She has a few lieutenants nearby worth 200 honor each, and is fairly easy to kill.
---
In a pure rush to the finish, Alliance usually win, so most Horde groups kill her to basically get something out of the bg.
---
Which means they killed the NPC‚Äôs in there.
---
No there is not, speaking for EU server. So this is not true at all.
---
I mean fair enough, but be up front with your group first that you want to do that.
---
As a tank I'll just choose to find another group. It might be boring for you to play your class, but it's not fun being a tank in those kind of groups.
---
If you find the normal dungeon run style boring because all your class does is spam Frostbolt, well that was your choice.
---
I‚Äôm all for paid transfers.  They were in vanilla, so why shouldn‚Äôt they be in Classic?
---
Trust me im not a fan of him at all. But im not naive &amp; petty  enough to trashtalk him and/or think im better than him. Same goes for all the hate on other streamers. Its just phatetic half this sub gets filled with comments like closetmangafan's
---
What are the Horde queues looking like for BGs?
---
Currently unguilded Orc Shaman on Mirage Raceway-EU and very often find myself in the same situation as you. It's always nice when you get a cohesive group who know what they are doing and have clearly worked together before. Have build up a semi-decent sized friends list of people who I like to run with now which makes it easier to get groups going forward.
---
Glad you are having fun.
---
Same here, got all the keys in my bank. I‚Äôm happy to get my bank slots back.
---
Horde are currently rushing Balinda, and kills all commanders and leutanants in towers, we get around 3k honor and 650 rep while alliance rushes last boss for 1,4k honor.
---
Avast ye swabs! Repel the invaders!
---
That or if it can stealth put into stealth and passive.
---
It wouldnt change anything if they did 1.0 through 1.12 or just released 1.12 straight. People min max everything and would do the same for 1.0 as 1.12.
---
Currently waiting out a debuff because players from an incredibly toxic PvP server (I used to play there it's horrendous) don't like my PvE server. Been happening to people all day.
---
Nothing will happen because of it.
---
nobody is gonna hit R14 this calander year anyway...
---
It's fun to run dungeons in a geared group once in a while. Me and a guildie needed dark iron smelting recipe from BRD so we got 4 guildies and a random from LFG chat and blasted through the whole place in like 30 minutes, then decided to go back and clean up the stuff we missed, trying to pull extra mobs on the way to see if the tank could handle it, fun times.
---
top guilds use full consumes and proper spec on every raid, respeccing doesnt cost much at all if your raiding once a week or even better if you do tues/wed reset for 2 week respecs, theres no excuse for pvp spec
---
It's not possible, whole industries would go down if people (consumers/customers/end user) stopped wanting to be spoon fed.
---
Yo I have a bridge to sell ya
---
You guys horde? Cause alliance have instant queues.
---
All the way at the bottom and click on the item your looking for. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/alterac-valley-battleground-classic-wow
---
About 500 per win with the token turn in if you do a rush
---
Ridiculous to see some of these people complaining..
---
Player: rush to last boss and kill it
---
Also player: omg why blizzard I didn't see a single enemy wtf
---
Loving all these posters,  you're doing an amazing job
---
Pretty fast grind with the current zerg meta, lot of people have been asking how long it'll take so there it is. Doesn't appear that Don Rodrigo's is in the game, unless only casters can see it for some reason? Good luck with your rep grind!
---
they're trying to fuck up classic so people would go back to retail
---
Not directly, but you get a pretty good amount from turning in the badges.  My cousin leveled 10-60 almost exclusively in BG‚Äôs in retail vanilla doing exactly this.  Believe he was rank 10 or 11 by the time he hit 60 too.
---
Same. As a tank that doesn't PvP, if this is available I'll queue all week.
---
Beautifully worded and I get it now. The light! Ty!
---
Pretty much all items before the item rework had no spellpower.
---
&gt; And this is a game design challenge
---
They could always just have made the intended way of playing AV also the best way of playing it.
---
I remember waiting for these comics back in vanilla. Just wanna say thank you, and great to find this again. Many fond memories!
---
I think people choose to interpret "early 2020" in the most positive way possible. 
---
Early 2020 is what has explicitly stated, though.
---
What a disgusting person, he actually wants to be rewarded for being good at PvP instead of rushing AV.
---
There has never been a fun version of AV, this is at least the quickest to farm exalted and necer look back.
---
Please stop giving these mouthbreathers attention.
---
lame
---
MoD is huge for pvp but obviously useless for raiding and dungeons. Are you on a pvp server?
---
No changes.
---
As far as i know noggenfogger costumes reduce hitbox. So deviate delight should as well.
---
This is real
---
Does anyone here have a permanent feeling of being 'behind'? even though I got to 60 within the first month of release I don't have a epic mount, and farming gold as a holy spec'd paladin is a rough deal. Instead I've taken to leveling alts, which I feel might end up the same way and just end up stagnating around max level. What really should I be doing at this point to make meaningful progress? Should I be respeccing to ret when not raiding and grinding? somehow I feel more lost in the end game than I did desperately cranking out the last 5 levels or so.
---
thats pretty insane, to be exalted in less than a day! How many games, roughly do you think it took?
---
Thank you for your input, even tho nobody asked. You will soon be contracted by Blizzard.
---
Is the odds in your favor? Or is it just dumb luck?
---
God I miss RIFT.
---
Such a good concept game.
---
Alright.. and i guess the ''boss'' is another boring tank&amp;spank...? Wooo
---
Dude, if u cant understand that the fact that the weekly update on the honorsystem has suddenly changed and not been communicated out by blizz whatsoever is stupid then idk what to tell u.
---
Im not going for high rank i just wanted my damn pvp boots on this resets and now it looks like i wont get it due to this
---
Back in the days i wrote stuff like "write down '/afk show' to show afk players, funny time back then..
---
I genuinely dont get it. I remember running av in tbc and "rush" starts were impossible since the defenders had such a huge advantage. You HAD to take graveyards and eliminate adds before your standard raid could make a dent in the boss
---
I just found it funny. Don't attack anybody its all jokes brother
---
It was a lovely time growing up playing this gem of a game and I'm thrilled that I can share this with my kids now. I thaught them everything they need to know to start their journey, gave them the basics but there was one thing I was adamant about. This was what I told them everytime they entered Azeroth and this was what I sent them to sleep with after I kissed them good night. There was one rule and one rule only. **Never violate Artivle 13 ever!**
---
This is exactly what people asked for. Mega servers instead of merging. No changes with what Blizzard had left from vanilla. Like 15 years later the game is so figured out, what were you expecting? People to not make it a speedrun? That is all there is left for this game.
---
Yeah i would basically want to see everything. How time consuming is raiding nowadays?
---
Back in vanilla I ran my Twink through dead mines at least 40 times, and not a single cruel barb dropped... fuck you edwin. Eat a bag of moldy dicks!
---
Good enough to comment on but not upvote some would say....filthy animals
---
yeah but on pservers the zerg wasnt nearly as easy/fast as it is here, you could actually pvp if you wanted to without the game ending in 6 minutes or less
---
Asked this in another thread but I‚Äôve cut down my list
---
I can‚Äôt decide what alt to roll and I‚Äôve spent weeks trying to decide (60 Fury Warrior main)
---
Initially it was Mage, but I‚Äôve decided that it isn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of casters (besides the below as they are a bit different)
---
Warlocks I like for their utility, summoning, soul shards add a different aspect to every other class, and the pets - and they are a bit rarer!
---
Priest was my main in vanilla/TBC, it is a caster of course but it has multiple ways to play, in shadow spec and as a healer
---
Druid I‚Äôve never played, but again I like that it can fill a number of rolls
---
You got more honor, they got more rep. The thing is you compete with your own faction for honor ranking so it doesn't really matter that much to alliance.
---
He means the exalted gear is equivalent to R13/R14 gear, basically free for killing 3 NPCs in ~10 minutes.
---
Hijacking too post
---
Been using Spurs, glove enchant and carrot for months. I'm nearly always in the front 3 players in AV alliance Zerg. I'm also one of the first targets for a mage nova or warrior charge. Lol not good for a disc priest.
---
It is just your feeling. There is nothing to behind from.
---
If you are level 60 you are already qualified to clear Molten Core in 2hours.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e963tb/exalted\_stormpike\_14\_hours\_as\_human/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e963tb/exalted_stormpike_14_hours_as_human/) 
---
Here you see a guy who reached exalted recently - check those prices.
---
if its 2 cc classes then yes absolutely. 
---
2 rogues at 55 should destroy a warrior
---
oh wtf lame
---
It seemed to me that that people were excited to play classic yet somehow had the goal of making it unplayable, like going from level 1 to MC on farm in a matter of a few weeks (for many people, not talking about world first specifically), and engaging en masse in the sociopathic honor farm, first in in world PvP and now in BG's was somehow exorcising demons they had with the game.
---
But you're highlighting a most negative situation here. Ofcourse people don't like to an instance for 1,5 hour if you can do it faster. Faster is not the problem, it's the constant chasing for doing it BETTER AND FASTER. Why not make some nice pulls, get loot and get to the next pack. And ffs dont make such high demands for group setups. You can clear every 5 man with some standard setup, you dont need the mos optimal setup to finish something
---
Blizzard could only recover the 1.12 data. (And little bits of just before it.) Classic (including AV) was always going to be 1.12. There was no way for anything else to happen.
---
While retail AV is a new thing. It has old Vanilla AV as inspiration but otherwise Blizzard is free to use all their resources (programmers, artists, designers) and create whatever they want.
---
I was having the same issue as OP and this fixed it for me. Much obliged.
---
&gt; Should I be respeccing to ret when not raiding and grinding? 
---
Nope, ret paladin grinding is on par with holy.  
---
Either get yourself farming alt like mage or hunt. Or tank for drops :)  
---
P.S. I moved to new server and found there interesting thing - level 60 players where selling "boosting" low-level dungeons for gold.   
---
2g per run in DM/Stockades. Not much, but still viable :)
---
Sure, but they didn‚Äôt just replay the same content for 10 years. Once new stuff came out they moved on, and they were keeping what they knew to themselves, so the information was less refined and less available.
---
Soda did WSG yesterday with ven and cdew, they seemed to really enjoy it but it‚Äôs not as efficient as AV spam.
---
Click item.
---
Select vendor who sells it. 
---
Lists all the prices you seek.
---
If you're not ranking then why are you even whining about the reset? Its meaningless to you after you get your trinket.
---
For those in guilds using a DKP system, does it actually work?
---
I‚Äôve heard a lot of people say it can cause a lot of problems but I am thinking of bringing it up to my guild leader or leaving.  This is our 5th week raiding MC three nights a week and I have only missed one night as a tank.  Yet, we are experiencing a lot of turnover at warrior and I keep losing rolls to warriors I have never seen before.  At this rate I am fed up and even thinking of quitting wow altogether and wondering how other guilds out there handle this type of situation.  My consistency and effort have only been met with letdown.  I do have the bracers because everyone in the raid at the time had them, but have otherwise not won a roll.  Even saw a 58 fpa warrior get the shoulders.  Need advice
---
My friend, ur disorder is nothing to joke about.
---
if u do infact suffer from major depressive disorder u should stay away from stuff that can trigger said disorder.
---
health is more important than a game.
---
wish u well m8.
---
Your comment has nothing to do with what I wrote. I think wow destroyed your braincells
---
Just because you can force yourself to not drink for a month does not make you a non-alcoholic. Same goes for WoW.
---
When the anniversary event began I saw a few summons, as people probably wanted to see them. But in the end people will go for the most efficient route, sadly.
---
It's about rep, not honor
---
small indie company :)))))))
---
yeah pretend you are looking for opposing raids while mercilessly slaughtering any solo player you see
---
Because resto druids were impossible to kill for most classes 1v1.
---
In fact I recall a bug with a toy car which allowed for an additional cast to keep going while you cast a new one.
---
Even with literally two casts, that could barely kill a resto druid.
---
That makes sense.
---
Hahaaah ! Amazing dude
---
Yea. It looks [like this](https://imgur.com/a/D3GdsQ7).
---
Its completly random, no skill involved. Dont know what he's suspecting us to ask, he got lucky and made some gold.
---
I feel really sry for you. My condolences.
---
How do I do that though? Lol
---
Do I have to redownload them?
---
Well I guess it depends on the rolls, when I first started I checked out 1899 straight to 1, which is ludicrously unlucky. Since then though I‚Äôve been on a roll so maybe I‚Äôve got all my bad luck out on that one.
---
queue*
---
Do you remember spell cleave? Even though none of them were going to be the first to 60 they all played like they were. Leaving groups if their "XP/HR" was lower than a certain threshold. This is the new era of wow players.
---
They weren't talking about people like you. They're talking about the horde who continued to mercilessly camp in IF and camp the same 10 people who are left all day and night, even after most alliance had left. If you weren't even safe in your own cities on a server that has the worst server imbalance, I'd leave too. 
---
Btw paid server transfer are possibly coming soon. Read the patch notes. 
---
Btw 2 mid 40s isn't even halfway, best bet is to just reroll. I have multiple high level toons on a PVP server and rerolled because I wasn't happy. I have a 47 warrior already. 
---
Or you can wait for transfers and do some BGs in the meantime since they're cross server.
---
Oh, thought it would be in top middle of your screen. Not sure if this is from an addon or just some bug in the game.
---
If you get into a decent guild you will be clearing onyxia and MC within 3 hours. Unless you're gonna go altaholic or try rank in PvP, classic isn't time consuming at all.
---
how is this a surprise.
---
I see people talking about 5-10 minute games approximately, let's assume 10. If we further assume the que time is nearly 0, that'd turn out to 84\~ games. Add +10% for non-humans and land on 93 games, rounded up. 
---
Just theoretically, of course.
---
"Not a fan of him at all", but you know what titles he has, bitch at people because you perceived them as saying they're better than him (which they didn't) and take it upon yourself to whiteknight him in a reddit thread. Hmm...
---
I that case, i must make a "looted forors compendium back to back in trib solo run AMA"
---
The boots are bis for my class in pve for a good while. Still not relevant to my point that this change to the reset schedule should have been communicated
---
God I'm so tempted to reroll alliance just to have easy access to deadmines.
---
So as a semi-casual 60, does that mean that I can't enjoy AV until Naxx comes out?
---
I just want to have fun in AV fighting against a group of Horde who hopefully want to have fun fighting me.  
---
I don't particularly care about the rep or honor of it.
---
Do you think non-rush games will be hard to find until people have gathered some gear from P3?
---
You get 3xx rep for win, and since he said he was getting 15-45 minute matches that means they got a bunch of other objectives done, which can amount to quite a bit of rep.
---
I prefer this to the pvp before BGs
---
Also don't see the Epic mount? Or is that a different vendor?
---
I actually doubt he (or others streamers) can afford to just run around on a mount inside AV for two months straight, as it's not entertaining for his viewers.
---
don julios isnt even one of top 2 rings in THIS phase for rogue
---
Well everyone else in your faction is also gaining the same amount of honor, so that's who you are competing with.
---
So, you aren't a fan of casers, but list both of the other caster classes as your top 2 choices?
---
If you like playing multiple, then druid, paladin or shaman are the way to go. All of them allow you to not play a caster, when you don't want to.
---
&gt;30 seconds
---
that's quite fast, go kill some more lvl 20 allies until it raises to 5 min. /s
---
why would blizz  address  it? they dont give a crap about imbalance, wpvp or anything else
---
Your first mistake was deleting your mid 40s alliance toon
---
Well you are simply outnumbered. You are ruining the experience for 39 people by essentially ruining their way of playing they consider fun.
---
Kinda reminds me of a porno.
---
We're all getting the same amount of honour while competing with each other. What's the problem?
---
Wow..15 FPS.. man I feel you \*hug\*
---
Ohh, well I think people are getting into the spirit of fighting the way I'm used to so I'm happy about that :) thanks for the info
---
The real winer of this AV is horde tho
---
12 hours as horde got me revered, something like 5 wins in all that time. The rep meta is fucked for horde because of imbalanced map.
---
Equivalency points, they're a ranking for individual stats. A rule of thumb for PVP is that stamina is the most valuable main stat so you give that one the highest score (in my case 10). On my mage I also value spell damage, so I give it 10 and 9. Int is useful but not as useful as the others. For rogues it's Agility/Stamina above everything else.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this. I've honored this by reading all of it.
---
I will try to at least improve the hunters in my guild (I'm a hunter) as I see them using arcane shot which I basically use 0% of the time. As for the rest, perhaps I'd be too prohibitive on the raid composition so maybe it would not be a good idea. We had 11 shamans yesterday in our raid. I guess 8 is ok for the fire resist totem. I might propose that we fuse the guilds since the other guys are a bit more strict about the schedule. Basically, even if the raid is 20/20, they pretty much lead it and we help out (healers have their own channel).
---
A guild merge definitely seems ok. Also, we've got 800 members or so in the guild and at some point we had 100 people online. Now it's more like 60 or so. We've got many alts, that's true. Probably the real number is between 300-400.
---
Horde have 4 objectives to the alliance zero in this picture. They would also have a bunch more npc kills. If you want honour don't win as fast as possible you have to take objectives. If you want rep then do win as fast as possible.
---
There was sarcasm in the past too.
---
Yikes...
---
Thanks!
---
Ikr, all these people talking about burnout... Like what, did you guys never touch Runescape?
---
Been playing RS since RS Classic, burnout is a myth to me.
---
arms definitely for mortal strike, kang the decapitator is best in slot, vice grips of the bear from zf or even strength I‚Äôm not sure if strength is an option but its also best in slot.  there are a few best in slot plate BOES like hydralick armor and sun scale helmet I believe unless you want to go for something like the Viking helm in Ulda is really good.  The legs from princess are also best in slot and her ring too.  really I think you only need to do ZF and Mara and most of the rest of the items can be bought generally cheap on the AH minus kang.  Warriors are really strong at 49 though you will have a lot of fun.
---
My question is, is there any stream sniping proof to back it up? From what we were told he was banned for "bullying" which is laughable when you consider that one of them is a millionaire playing a game with 10's of thousands of followers.
---
Oh, yeah, I can totally do that on my own while everyone else is rushing. Great advice!
---
A bit disappointed that AV is just a degenerate run by PVE thing apparently. Now that I read about it here, I remember that it was that way in vanilla too for a long time. But the thing that stuck from vanilla a lot more were the epic, day-long matches, and as someone who plays classic only casually and doesn't care for getting exalted, I would've liked to play one of those again ;)
---
We kite two elites into the crowd coming out of Bal and they‚Äôre worth +190 honour each, little things like that have become routine. As far as I can tell ally just pure zerg it, completely skipping the horde mini boss and most elites.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e7219e/got_there_in_the_end/
---
Korrak's Revenge in retail is just a straight PVE zergfest now too.  It was fun for a couple of weeks, but you can't stop the meta.
---
I do and stop starting your sentences with 'Imagine' just because your favorite Twitch streamer does it. Get a personality.
---
There were a dozen threads for a year on why this AV was gonna suck. Blizzard did listen... they gave retail the best version.
---
Every game i've played has been horde lose, gain 2700 honor, while alliance gain 700. Thats the same?
---
What you said then!
---
I remember falling for that -.-
---
No I understood what you meant about the xp. The point is irrelevant because I've still invested a huge amount of time in my character. I \*could\* get another character to mid-40s, but I would also need to farm cooking and fishing to 300, level up my other professions, farm my mount up again. It's more than just levels.  
---
And I'm not sure what a paid transfer precedent has to do with being made to pay Blizzard for the mistakes of Blizzard.
---
Let me guess, you're alli?
---
Same here bud but at least we're not facing 15-25 min queues right off the bat
---
How much is the frost wolf? In total
---
Hey man same thing happened with me! Was lvl 14 on a new server running rfc befriended the healer and we ran every dungeon lvling up together with his other friend. Now we shoot the shit in discord while playing and are in the same raiding guild.
---
Haven't done AV yet but since I've had to tank every SM run I did, I really wanna know who doesn't have to pay attention. Maybe the DPS, since they would get aggro then run/jump in circles as they got chased
---
Ken oath
---
is there a way to display dodges/misses/etc in the combat log? i know you can enable it for the floating combat text but id like to be able to review the fight via the log.
---
I see what your saying, but part of the rush comes from blizzard rushing content. I know people who play 18 hours a day and complain they don't have time to do everything before Blizzard pumps out the next content in half the time vanilla took.
---
I take it you‚Äôre just fine with 1.12 talents and itemization?
---
You are an actual window licker, go paint more pottery you fucking simpleton
---
I know there was, still didn't surprise me in the slightest.
---
Is your guild still growing? I was in a similar position a few weeks ago. Tonight, we one shot everything for the first time with no issues.
---
Having a stable roster and a few weeks of gear makes a big difference.
---
I would not roll in a guild as the one you described. If may work if you have a steady raid roster and everyone is fine with rolling, but high turnover? No way, never.
---
DKP is one of the most fair systems, if not the most fair one. It rewards you for showing up on time and coming prepared, attending, killing stuff and staying for the clear - depending on how you've set up your DKP rules, of course. And even on the nights when you fight for an item / items and don't win, you're improving your own position as you likely made some other guy bid a sizable amount of their DKP for an item. The one problem that might arise is when some people start hoarding for one specific item and passes on everything else and raids in scrubgear - but that's behavior that your classleaders / leadership should dissuade. And DKP squish for next raid tier, no saving up all your DKP in MC and using it to buy ever item straight away in BWL. 
---
It may not be for everyone, I think it's a fair and simple system - and it is not random like /rolls are.
---
My post was just a troll and a joke dude, stop policing me on the internet.
---
Pretty much on the dot my friend. Whether your honor/hr is 1k or 10k doesn't really matter. Everyone else has the same honor/hr, and it's really just about who ends up with an hour less sleep than you/an hour more playtime than you.
---
There's literally no benefit to high numbers. 
---
Back in vanilla on my server we had a warrior who sat on grand marshal for 28 weeks straight. He grinded about 550k honor per week minimum, and the one just below him did about 270k a week.
---
He could've grinded 300k and been safe, and it would not have changed a single thing.
---
Maybe not the most efficient regarding speed, but questing is a great source of gold (base gold + bonus gold instead of xp + items to sell)  
---
It's definitely more enjoyable than farming the same spot for hours.
---
 Blizzard: "I hope your ready for an unforgettable BG release!"
---
Community: "mmyes"
---
Blizzard: "Oh gee god, this BG release is ruined!! but what if I disguise this mess of a release through a lengthy server shutdown? Hohoho delightfully devilish Blizzard!"
---
asmon likes to talk shit, then whenever shit hits him back he cries like a baby, he wants to play but fuck if someone plays back then its harassment and whatever else.
---
Asmongold is quiet literally the male version of a female that cries rape if she doesn't get what she wants.
---
Which is what I'll end up doing- to each their own, but I legitimately loved the hour long stalemates.
---
Return it to the earlier verion of AV.

Done.  Sovled. Fixed.  You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Simple loot rolls witohut any system beneath it to support long term palyers sucks. Your high turnover also indicates, that you are seen as a target. I.e. people join your raid with an alt to immediately get some items from random rolls nad leave again.
---
Your guild must establish a DKP/Loot council/EPGP or similar system to bind people to your guild and to ensure that people like you aren't disgruntled by losing loot to new members.
---
Also 3 nights MC a week? Do you need this long to clear or do you have twink raids?
---
There's dungeon loot tables and a few other things that aren't simple gating. But for the most part it's using 1.12 mechanics.
---
I play horde on flamelash, its been very peacefull for awhile now.
---
I wanted to play with my friends. I had way more fun playing with them than I did alone. I don't regret starting over. I regret believing that Blizzard could handle simple things in a 15 year old game
---
Outrage culture strikes again on the most pointless non issue topic.
---
Get a life op
---
That‚Äôs literally how hero based ctf is, some classes or jobs or heroes will be better than others at defending, attacking and carrying the flag. Just do your job.
---
It‚Äôs the better pvp mode imo that actually has somewhat skill to it since it‚Äôs 10v10 meaning you as an individual have to pull a lot more weight.
---
AV is pretty bad though, literally Zerg to the end. And you can‚Äôt blame people, they just want their don julios
---
I can't find a definitive answer on where black lotus are in AV. Yes, I should be doing objectives, but i'm broke as hell after crafting hide of the wild and that'd be helpful. Any map have locations pointed out?
---
HIS NAME IS COOKIE
---
&gt;but people still think any change is bad.
---
no, not ANY change, only the changes the hivemind doesnt want. LFG addons were everywhere in vanilla. And blizzard removed it for classic cause a bunch of neckbeards kept reeing
---
You don't compete with Alliance, so their honor doesn't matter for you.
---
It's not about giving up, it's that once you get wiped at Drek, and people start respawning at base, horde gets wiped at base and you have a 30m+ standstill if not more. For a lot of players taking the hit from a 15 min deserter is worth it at that point.
---
I weep for your server because that has not been the case for me
---
Why is it broken?  Horde cant win on a straight Race, Alliance have easier access to the horde base &amp; towers. So why wouldnt horde go for Belinda and the Alliance Lts? Seriously, are you advocating that Horde should get less honor killing all of the NPCs except Van, while alliance should get more just for going straight to Drek? What are you annoyed at?
---
'15 years on and i just found out you can surrender a BG, thanks ya cheese eating surrender monkeys'.
---
AV is only so bad how people make it. You can have nice 40vs40 kill battles. But ofc if no one wants to do them you don't have them.
---
In a few weeks once alliance have acquired their exaulted rep queues will start to increase but I dont see them getting too bad.
---
aye that sounds fair enough.
---
2h / week for MC, you should have a greater fire prot pot aswell(6-7g)
---
No but you could also just not do it then? 
---
There's a difference between being in situations you don't enjoy and choosing to spend hours upon hours doing something you hate just to check off a box on your BIS spreadsheet. You do you man.
---
Forgot us level 50s just wanting xp. I'll join the fight at 60 but for now I'm harpie grinding
---
Av is for Rep, not honor. :D
---
Warriors are good when geared at max level. But regardless no lvl 48s can survive the death squads of 5 lvl 60s
---
Wow you are very dumb.
---
You mean Cookie's Cove don't you?
---
Warriors are THE worst class in 1vs1. Very strong if you have a pocket healer though :)
---
Earthfury? Think I've seen you around
---
I really like how bgs arent even 24h in the game and all the crybabys are now shifting from "cant do x y in the open world" to "omg blizz fix av so broken, its unplayable!"
---
Horde are invaders, so of course they are bad.  They didn't come to tell you about the good Lord Jesus Christ.
---
Yes so they can tell their investors that retail attracts more people so they can stop wasting their time.
---
Well, yeah, the weekend long AVs were like mini-games. It‚Äôs depressing that they‚Äôre gone. But mathematically the honor works out better in the zergs, I think in my 6 minute matches I get 1k and in the one 45 minute match the horde won, they got 4K.
---
You don't believe there are small packs of roaming 60s looking for easy kills?  
---
I don't doubt that it was super shitty for a lot of alliance players. But I don't see how I contributed anything to anything. I was just trying to play the game with my friends :(
---
My point is you didn't have to delete your old toon at all. Your friends could've joined you on that old server.
---
Do you understand what sarcasm is? 
---
I hate to say that, but he has gotten you hard.
---
Who or what is that in the left larger cannon.
---
Bahhaha thats pretty much my wow life atm.
---
Come home from work prepare dinner, eat and spend time with mrs all the while thinking about logging on to wow. 9pm feels about sufficient time spent with mrs and encourage her to go bed. Log wow 9:30 try find a group to run dungeon 12-1am log off. Hop into bed and goodle bis gear for another 30mins or so. Wake up and repeat
---
typical mimimi
---
It's not broken. PvP is working exactly as it was years ago.
---
Alright thank you very much i think i will give it a try. Now i have only have to decide between rogue and Shadowpriest haha
---
The quest is not owned by anyone so just bad luck someone went to claim, not a "trolling"
---
I play Alliance on Faerlina.
---
Last night I ran about Un'goro for 3 hours and was only killed once by the Horde. Even then, it was just a solitary warlock that seemed to be farming herbs. 
---
This was from 830-1130 EST.
---
There were clips where you can clearly hear Asmon's stream on the background. Also having ally alt to /who and asking others doesn't make the stalking and targeted harassment any better, which is also against the rules of Twitch. He's a literal e-stalker and I wonder when he's going to drop the "e-" part. People just don't mind because they hate Asmongold.
---
Think I saw on atlas loot that it's released in a different phase
---
People are toxic. Put em behind a screen with no face to face consequences. It‚Äôs amazing what they are ok with doing and saying.
---
Yeah, I was a DK in WotLK, so cannot really compare that to the classic experience ;) 
---
But in vanilla (and BC) I was a mage and the most interesting parts of the gameplay were early cancelling spells due to bad ping.
---
Sarcasm is pretty hard to detect in texts if you don't understand the context.
---
I barely had enough time to get the flag for the quest
---
And? It‚Äôs still the person you think of when you hear that name. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more than one Paul McCartney, Britney Spears, and such, but there‚Äôs only one of each when you hear it.
---
Once they get full Warlord gear and wep it will finally be time for them to conquer their ultimate end goal - killing lowbies in Hillsbrad and STV.
---
That would drive me crazy quick enough
---
AV was rushed in vanilla too.
---
&gt;don‚Äôt act like top 25 guilds in the world from Vanilla weren‚Äôt going Charlie Day on **everything**.
---
What in the fuck does this even mean?
---
Reminds me of when I tried some retail a few days before classic launch day.  Logged in, had no fucking idea what I was doing, 1/2 my buttons were missing from 4 years before, my spec was reset and talents were completely different.  Then an orc walked by and was standing up straight and I was like fuck this and logged out never to come back.
---
I think the main point of the article makes sense, but the example they gave is yup pretty bad.
---
It is what it is man. I have 3 45+ toons on a PVP server and I wasn't happy so I moved on. 
---
You can fix it. or wait on blizzard to, which probably won't happen. or quit. 
---
I chose the former, am super glad I did and haven't looked back.
---
about 20 hours
---
Don't know the exact interview, but I screencapped this gem from Blizzcon. Look into his [face.](https://imgur.com/a/pABZFdZ)
---
It doesn't.
---
It's because most people who play this game and that are in this sub are totally braindead.
---
Did you see that ‚ÄúI did a thing‚Äù video he did about the aurora borealis where he used that same joke? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
All of these stupid posts make me realize that people still don't understand how the PvP ranking system in this game works. It rewards time played not players' skill. You can have "fun", competitve PvP or you can grind ranks;Sadly, you cannot have both.
---
it's actually not fun for the team that doesn't turtle, its incredibly boring.
---
There were 3 of them and they had reached the same level as I had, more or less. It made much more sense for me to reroll than for the 3 of them to reroll. If it was up to me I would have had them join me on Alliance side, but hey ho.
---
4/5 of the people doing the honor grind are not going to make it to the rank to get gear.
---
I mean legion was OK - but it had huge problems too.  I'd 100% play classic over a new legion quality expansion.
---
I probably will give the new expansion a go when it launches just because it's new shiny but I doubt it'll keep my attention.
---
People were camping everywhere and hating that too. They do it for the rewards even if the task is boring af
---
good point! he'll change his tune as soon as enough viewers start complaining, I'm sure.
---
You do that and the other Horde players will bitch and moan about how long the game drags on. They want their quick loss. :/
---
Warriors go fury, that‚Äôs all there is to it. No one wants to heal your undergeared, inexperienced character. The DPS warriors want the night gear too. Your raid isn‚Äôt gonna let you OT and take gear so you can stand on the side line not tanking and not doing damage. Your not helping your raid
---
Well the alliance is happy about your short queue times, win win.
---
cause ally = nabs
---
How where they going to load the cannons anyway
---
They obviously find it fun enough to do it.
---
&gt;Does anyone here have a permanent feeling of being 'behind
---
No because i'm smart enough to not compare myself with people who have a playtime ten time bigger.
---
Atleast not right now. 
---
But as soon as people are mostly exalted, there should be other forms of gameplay in AV.
---
there‚Äôs no directions telling you how to get the fuck out of the blood elf city
---
ok huso
---
Yeah but the dinner is a near never-ending turd. There's lots of people that like classic and despise the leveling.
---
I can‚Äôt help it. I still find it funny and do it occasionally
---
Wrong on so many points. Read up on the warlock discord.
---
Do **not** go spriest if you want a raiding spot in Naxx. Guilds would be taking 1 max and if they plan on it, that slot is likely already filled, likely by an officer. That's my advice!
---
People have been stockpiling lotus for ages, could just be selling old stock.
---
Not every dude from england is a skinhead...
---
Yo I got in a 42 minute AV last night and had a fucking blast. Both sides fucked up the rush and got caught in the middle trying to break through. Ended up with like 116 HK‚Äôs
---
Just reply
---
    I don‚Äôt play with pedofiles
---
You don‚Äôt understand the honor system I think. It‚Äôs irrelevant how much the other faction gets
---
Can't possibly be that efficient when 2/3 games end in 7 minutes.
---
you are clueless arent you
---
I left a bg last night by just shutting my cpu off after 45 min in WSG with only one flag captured. I didn‚Äôt know how to just leave the bg. 
---
Not complaining. I love this experience. But man it was wild.
---
you should get a title "the Sad"
---
Because every group of fresh 60s can beat Rag on their first day of raiding...
---
Yet they made Korrak Revenge on retail
---
The last time I fell for that was in 2007. lmao
---
Completely new player here! Being an old fart with little to none keyboard skills (keybindings), what would be a good class for me?
---
I‚Äôll be going Horde and so far people have recommended mage and hunter as they require less button smashing.
---
its also against twitch tos to send your chat to harass other people and you are supposed to mod your chat. both should be banned for a certain amount of time. cut and dry.
---
As a russian i must say that russians who play Valve games a quite different to other russian gamers.
---
If you‚Äôre horde I would highly recommend shaman.  It‚Äôs a good mix of caster, melee, and utility.
---
K.
---
Yep its pretty bad version..Blizzard in vanilla nerfed long AV's hard and then they didnt bother to correct that mistake .
---
That gives no raw benefit over other players, but ok.
---
someone going to have free time i can feel it!
---
If i didn't need exalted I wouldn't
---
well, the current situation is to either farm honor by afking av to climb rank or abandon rank push to have fun in ws.
---
if the av rush was not possible then the honor difference would be much smaller which would be more healthy for the game. its also not a question of lack of feedback for blizzard since there was enough, but them implementing something without understanding the consequences. well, that happens when the people in decision making positiong and your devs are dogshit at video games.
---
good thing is that alliance player should be able to quest in open world again since the honor farmers are stuck in av and queues are around 2-5min so far.
---
They might, but they allways speak native when they found just 1 other country man.....
---
No, but some in the raid will do that.
---
Population had nothing to do with it though. If it was up to me I would have kept playing Alliance, because I prefer the racials. I just wanted to play with my friends. This situation would have happened whether I changed or not. For the record, none of my friends even made it to 60 before quitting, and had no part in the mass ganking either. They spent most of their time trying to 3-man dungeons as rogues because they are mad bastards. Never seen anybody have so much fun as they did, though.
---
What fish you get in AV?
---
is it in? finally make space in my bank!!!!!!
---
as a new player, what happens if you do this?
---
&gt;How people with physically demanding jobs are able to handle this
---
We drink a shit ton of Coffe and at somepoint we are used to it. Most of the time when I finish my work I'm like "Ok, somehow I managed this but I get early to bed!" and few hours later it is 2:00 am and start regretting my decision again
---
There's also the possibility that they only had classic-compatible code for this version, and were given no time to convert / rewrite the other versions.
---
Which is still bad from management, but not on the devs.
---
Gambling... but seems more fun than just doing it in one roll
---
does that mean i can finally get to lvl 60 now? omg !!!!
---
Oh no! Alterac Valley is impossible now - how will some members of the group not know to ignore all the horde and run directly to the boss.
---
horde are still getting sick rep for killing the Lts and commanders, and handing in the quests. They'll get exalted in no time.
---
It kicks you from the BG and you get the deserter debuff
---
You get ported out of the BG.
---
I mean there‚Äôs guilds that clear mc in 30 minutes, so it‚Äôs already that way.
---
BRD is one of the few dungeons that has gone completely unchanged since classic.
---
Haha my friend delivered the best one.
---
We were on discord doing a ubrs run with a bunch of randoms. When i hear glass breaking noises through my headphones.
---
So I go brb and take a look. Outside it‚Äôs a meth head cracking all the windows in my apartment complex with a shovel.
---
So I tell my mate on discord I probably should do something about it. He instantly writes ‚Äúsorry guys, violentstonerdude needs to deal with a meth head outside, the run is over‚Äù. They thought he was joking.
---
Luckily the police pulled up 1 minute after and I could continue the run while hearing a screaming meth head being detained in the background.
---
are rogue/driuds still going deep and camping the base graveyards?
---
Played one yesterday that went just over an hour. Was awesome.
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs funny how much truth there ended up being here. I was certainly on the side of wtf i absolutely do want this, and now I‚Äôm unsubbed.
---
The honor in AV is so good that nobody in their right mind would be trying to get any in the open world.
---
It's as if everyone who said BGs would alleviate the world gank issue were totally right for pointing out the incredibly obvious.
---
Yes, massively more honor received in AV than doing world PvP, especially if you cap the objectives, kill the LTs and commanders/bunkers.
---
time elapsed 5 min ... how is the this possible?
---
Haven‚Äôt seen a single actual case of this that wasn‚Äôt a display bug. Bliz actually fixed the first two weeks that did have errors retroactively which is why some people gained a little bit of rank progress randomly a few nights ago.
---
Its not about the Version of AV, players are zerging no matter what because people know better about the game now. Why waste time playing AV out if you can just lose but still get maximum honor/rep?
---
The odds were high that from reading the title I predicted this would be another post with a picture about how someone rolled the same number as someone else, like 100 posts before you. clap clap.
---
The amount of comments in here that are like "lol ball and chain" "wife aggro" "lol fuck girlfriends can you believe she wants to spend time with me" is depressing.
---
There is no fun version of AV.  AV is the operation metro of wow.  It is trash and the sort of people who enjoy it are trash
---
My girlfriend comes back next week after being 4months in another country. I had to work my ass off during this time because my new job is hard as fuck (and ofc they pay a guy in his mid 20‚Äòs like shit as well). I played in my freetime so much classic because it calmed me down. I feel you buddy
---
It's pretty annoying to lose 1 cap in WSG and have 3-4 players just GG and leave, like if there was ever a chance for a comeback it's gone now, really drains the thrill of the fight, which is why I'm on a PvP server and in a BG in the first place. Can't say it didn't happen in vanilla too, but these guys are really missing out on the 0-2 games that I have come back from, nothing feels better than underdog comebacks when they work. Shit, even if you lose 2-3 the tension in the air just rises and the brain does it's little reward dance all the same.
---
&gt;Have you actually played it recently?
---
Yep. I last played it this past weekend. I've played over 60 games, having leveled 7 alts from 110 to 120, along with one from 102 to 117 so far. Never experienced a single rush. The tower masters being alive will increase Dreks health from 240,000 to 3,800,000, a number not feasible managed by the downscaled level 60s in there.
---
It puts you in &lt;AFK&gt;NAME, and since you are AFK, you are automatically removed form the bg, with 30 mins (iirc) deserter status. 
---
Which means you can't queue for battlegrounds for 30 minutes.
---
It's a kind of prank, some would call it griefing, idk.
---
You're such a rebel. I wish I was as cool as you.
---
How much I did this in AV, holy molly... fuck I feel so stupid about it now :/
---
Take your upvote
---
Yeah but it would have be agonising for the other 70 people in the game. I know it's your way of fun but I hope this kind of stuff is seldom because it's just slowing down the inevitable
---
What I don't get about it is if you skip the game to get to the best items, what do you then do with said items? If you're just doing raids/bg's to get the gear, what's next? Bank stand for 12 hours a day showing off?
---
Twinkinfo redirects to xpoff. And he actually put me and others on ignore lol
---
Lol I played 4 hours of horse riding simulator today, don't worry you didn't miss out on much
---
Anyone who waits in two hour queues is actually an idiot. If you're on a server that has queues during primetime just remote log in before you get home. It's seriously not hard.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Can't wait to enter the fray!
---
i got more honor from 6 hours of AV yesterday than i did from 60 hours of wpvp last week, and people are't even playing AV for honor yet it's all about the rep for the alliance PvErs
---
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you over being logged off outside of raid hours because there's jack to do aside from raiding in Classic.
---
You can have the horde kill the NPC for the ony head quest turn in and when he respawns another ony head can be dropped and the buff will go out. Only takes a few rogues to kill him and it's a short respawn timer.
---
Good lord, this is peak gamer brain right here.
---
I think you're talking about MN but my experience watching him is completely different. I find him to be a nice and funny guy, enjoyable to watch.
---
You can say what you want but chance is a good guy
---
A good guy that never learned how to have normal human contact but he's still a good guy
---
You might look like one of them, but they still hate you
---
I like retail for the content outside of raiding, especially M+ keeps me going.
---
Haha yeah i just do turn in quests and troll the people barking out orders in /BG chat
---
I think you should ask yourself what you want from an alt?
---
I'm also a warrior main, and for me the ability to farm gold efficiently in a reasonably engaging way was critical, as i was sick of being gold starved as a warrior. I also don't like casters, so I went with a hunter for this reason. It keeps many elements of gameplay i like, while providing something new and engaging.
---
If you want to try a different role I think druid is a great shout, especially with BGs round the corner.
---
He is not.
---
He is standing in the foreground, together with the pirate sitting on a crate and Greenskin.
---
That's not a great example of sarcasm though because that's not how the system works.
---
One by buddies got a +4 stats off Belinda
---
Yeah that was kind of my point. Have no problem if people dont want to stick around for a longer game. My problem is when both sides wipe and the game is basically reset and then people start telling everyone to let the other side win and flame people who are still trying.
---
You have an add on that‚Äôs gone nuts.
---
He's streaming.. Just under his  mimimimimi no one wants to see wow and everyone is streamsniling me twitch account aka skippypoppin
---
Druid healers , priest healers.
---
I'm not sure a 7 minutes PVE AV is better. When you go into a battleground, you first of all go there to do PVP. So yes, being casting AOEs on a bridge (or anywhere else in the BG) during 6 hours makes sense.
---
As time consuming as you want it to be, also depending on your goals in the game.
---
Instant queues?  They're like 5 minutes for Horde in our battlegroup.
---
asmonbald is pure as pure as an asshat as they come and his guild is full of ninjalooters.
---
I mean, just like every new patch people will spam the new shiny toy and the world will be empty for a week or two and then its back to people farming and fighting happens because people are farming the same thing. 
---
Im alliance so idk what the queue times are but WSG was instant all last night.
---
He stopped streaming to hit Rank 14 aka probably was doing some lowkey win trading.
---
PVE server doesn't really help with the fact that WoW doesn't really have challenging PVP gameplay prior to TBC.
---
Faerlina would be my only guess
---
We ran (4) matches in like 2.5 hours (queue times) with our premade and won 4-0, played entirely against other premades. Was a ton of fun.
---
But it‚Äôs not efficient and we‚Äôre not going to do it again because we know the AV meta is the only way to rank seriously. AV is the death of PvP in this game atm.
---
How life always comes to kick your ass when your having fun :(
---
I only have one question - did you search for his titles and achies just now for a reply to the original comment or did you search for it in the past and just kept knowledge of it? I'm honestly just curious, unless the Google search thing was a "I'm pretty sure it's one Google search" and not "it's definitely one Google search, I know because I've done it"
---
When I was brand new to the game in like 05 on New year's right after midnight my best friend told me "span alt F4 for free gold. It's a new years reward" 
---
Oops.
---
Jump ship.
---
You're right, it's pretty selfish. But so is a roaming gank squad killing lvl 50+ levelers. There's really no answer to make everyone happy.
---
For like 2 days
---
Tbh, in my eyes whole classic experience is 1 huge rush shit show.
---
People know this game so good, that they don't enjoy it, celebrate it.
---
All just want to be max lvl, have best gear at once and now win AV as fast as they can.
---
I was super excited for classic and I'm starting too loose interest in it, cause I can't catch up. 
---
Wsg are going to be all premades, AV are going to be a pve race. Time to cancel my subscription I guess.
---
Honestly if you can get your team to clash with alliance in the middle of the map (when everyone typically just rides past each other) and wipe them, the alliance will panic and all sit in their base lol. I‚Äôm alliance and have noticed this happens in the few losses I‚Äôve had. If they wipe on Drek or in the middle, the WHOLE team will camp the base graveyard and essentially give up.
---
Personally I fight for the enjoyment and not for a payoff. Same reason we fought before when it meant nothing.
---
Ha. Had this same thought last night. Joined LookingForGroup at 10:30 thinking... Maybe I can find a arena run. Ended up being full Mara clear.
---
How to fix the visual bug?
---
actually he's the one person who's spamming this over and over, check his profile.
---
Try 20-40 minutes delay between 5-10pm on Firemaw for the last 2-3 weeks
---
Well yeah, WSG is for when you actually want to have fun in a BG.
---
I clicked on one yesterday while trying to pan my camera around.
---
There was a post from a human who made exalted in 14hours
---
I think the concern surrounding classic as a whole is that people aren‚Äôt taking time to enjoy the game. Instead they‚Äôre focused on gearing as efficiently as possible, forgetting to have fun along the way
---
Oh good to know thanks. I'm so out of the scene it's incredible how much the game has changed lol
---
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt stop thinking about your BiS at 2:00‚Äù good to know i‚Äôm not alone!
---
Like actually. LFR Orgozoa is a million times harder than any other boss from MC (aside from maybe rag). It doesn't take away from the enjoyment I get out of MC, though.
---
I love reading this sub as someone who doesn't care about classic. Fresh complaints every day, it's amazing, much better than most drama subs.
---
Which is less than travel time to your dungeon/world pve spot, especially less than your corpse walks.
---
Then you start doing PvP, and get rolled over by people with actual gear. And I've yet to encounter one of my Pug raids clearing MC sub 3 hours, and that's with way better items on lots of players than "just 60".
---
You get mass reported for playing on Mongo's server? What's wrong with this "community".....
---
Since the update my ping has gone from 163ms up to 2800ms+. I have tried disabling all addons and I‚Äôve tried updating them. 
---
I‚Äôm based in Beijing playing on OCE servers using the tunneler Qiyou. Haven‚Äôt had a problem since launch, until now.
---
Buy a Honda, never have car issues again :) Hopefully there is some positive things in your life too and remember to focus on those :)
---
Once you get geared from ranking you can go turtle AVs for fun like I plan to
---
Or take 10x longer if you want
---
This is wrong in a lot of ways to any warlocks reading this. I really encourage y'all to visit the Warlock discord for resources, evidence, and bis lists with alternatives backed up with math
---
Well how many threads of complaints would there be if they did not implement 1.12 AV? You assume everyone agrees with you.
---
Someone photoshop in Lord Serpentis plz
---
19 bracket is for nerds. 29 and 39 is the place to be.
---
I might misremember, but weren't paid transfers introduced way into AQ, not that long before TBC? If so, that's still in Vanilla, but arguably very late compared to now. Can't quite recall though, it's been a while.
---
Nothing wrong with being the under dog
---
Its Actually insane how much this sub hate everything. This community is weird
---
This is false information. You can in fact earn EXP by killing mobs in AV and turning in quests.
---
No one will bother stopping the zerg/rushing on either side, that‚Äôs what people want. If AV is more efficient, no one will swap to WSG.
---
We went 4-0 yesterday and queue time was approximately 15 minutes, each bg lasting approximately 10-20 and we received approximately 1/2 - 1/3 of what we would have gotten in AV the entire time. It‚Äôs shit, Sprawl.
---
Why would you pug high level stuff if you can just get a guild?
---
Day before yesterday, we set up a UBRS group taking 3 under-60's and a total of 4 healers with 1 tank. Not ideal. So we brought in 3 warlocks and grouped them with two priests with holy nova.
---
Proceeded to hellfire every single pack until after Rend, where it stopped working. It was glorious.
---
Because the horde are so god damned ugly they result in eating fish to look like humans.
---
This is really cool!
---
Sounds awesome. Can't wait to try it out!
---
Oh, he's just copy pasting it, lol.
---
If you own the base version of wow you essentially own all expansions up to BFA, so you can get to 110.
---
Don‚Äôt worry friend, the Horde will be there to liberate you soon!
---
Nobody tell him
---
I'm alliance, they're instant. But again like I said, the ONLY reason to level this way is to lvl while also getting exalted with the AV faction for the weapons. 
---
Either faction, you will level slower than grinding/questing in the world. The mobs you grind are 51-53 maybe 54 I forget. 
---
It is not efficient. It is solely an option to lvl while leeching honor and rep.
---
I'm not talking about "people", I'm talking about what I liked.
---
Lol, brutal but true.
---
Dude just start farming prebis items .... don't quest.
---
You ever try to have sex in a pool? Water definitely not wet.
---
If you're pasting stuff into the picture anyway, might as well up the brightness first ;)
---
You can level an alt to keep in touch with that guild.
---
A slightly organized casual guild is way better than any pug.
---
Mara is boring. After you kill tinkerer, you cN kite rotgrip from the lower bridge all the way up to princess. There are plenty of vids out for that. You get a hydra sometimes but you just fd after rotgrip dies.
---
Dm trib is way more money, especially if you practice. Aside from blues that drop, major mana pots actually sell for a decent amount on my server. You can always sell chest loot too.
---
No spec is needed for dm trib. Ive ran mm/surv and mm/bm. Theyre both fine. Its about learning the quirks and controlling your pet more than anything.
---
[This](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-patch-1-13-3-lua-api-change/384543) is the actual post you should be linking, and this proves literally nothing you've said whatsoever lol, you're actually proved MORE wrong than before.
---
Zero mention of spam, latency, lag...not a damn thing. They wanted to alter the social dynamic and how players interact...
---
Keep trying, maybe one day you won't look like a complete baboon.
---
What is the mod that shows all those stats?
---
Probably blood razor/thrash blade.
---
It's not a 5-10 minute rush but still both factions rush to the other base, taking towers on the way, then waiting in front of the boss for the towers to drop, followed by pulling the boss. Sure its not as fast, but there is still not a lot of PvPing/defing going on. It plays exactly the same as regular retail AV.
---
Yup if you effectively play for 1-2h a day (dinner shower) u will level slowly just enjoy. Tipp:  Google some mob grinding spots for warriors ur lvl if u run out of quests. Yes, like the southpark episode!
---
No, from where you are, the XP required per level feels pretty similar through 59. There‚Äôs no sudden extreme spike.
---
They were, yep. But we're also on 1.12 talents with 1.12 items in a 1.12 AV. Paid transfer arriving early doesn't really hold any weight.
---
I mean you can't exactly count 6 of them as full bosses, they're just minibosses, but I get your point. Classic Scholo feels like much more of an adventure than MoP Scholo.
---
That would just make people grind the remaining HKs in world pvp at the end of the week, hillsbrad style.
---
Maybe think about doing other things like AV rep grind and/or just play less and level when you have rested XP? I know my last day playing for the year will probably be Saturday, so I‚Äôll try to ding 53 and just get a good chunk of rested XP while I‚Äôm away.
---
We had some fat loot last night, same concern. First trash mob dropped bracers and we saw that 120 something spell power trinket. Thank blizzard we didnt roll back.
---
So with current AV meta, I guess WSG is pretty much dead? Can a good premade match AV honor gain per hour?
---
Yeah me too, its awesome! So entertaining.
---
You get 30 days.
---
stfu retard LUL
---
Yep, it‚Äôs just a waste of time!
---
Sounds like good times were had! Hopefully things look a bit more uppety IRL soon as well. Until then, try to find your way back to that group or a similar one; who knows, perhaps their guild even has a spot for a healer?
---
Dont need to stealth as combat, imo its quicker to just level and come back and train on jukeboxes, and easier.
---
Russians  are cancer in literally every online game, not just CS:GO and Dota. Rude, entitled, bad.
---
"Mate, what do you mean you need those files today?! I need Mageblade too, do you see me whining? Don't be a lootwhore, whats your DKP?"
---
I can only repeat what I've written.
---
Classic is supposed to be Vanilla recreated exactly. They only got 1.12 Vanilla data. They can't just create something earlier because that would be guessing. Even if for some people it would be better.
---
While in retail they are free to do whatever. So they can go on by "feeling" or memories or old videos, etc.
---
This one right here
---
I was mainly wondering if theirs any limit to how much mail you can stack.
---
Do you need ram/wolf riding to use it?

Can anyone confirm this works
---
&gt;My job sucks, my parents are showing age, most of my friends are depressed, money is tight and my car needs work again. 
---
I'm an unemployed 31 year old college student. My father is deceased and my mother is getting older daily. I have no friends. Money is worse than tight, it is almost non-existent. Two of our cars need work, and the one my wife drives can't make up its mind.
---
But. I'm happily married with two wonderful children. I have a house, we all eat, and we have clothes. 
---
No matter how much life sucks, there are always things to be thankful for which can be found. 
---
Take joy in the small things and find yours where you may. Good luck to you.
---
I find the fact the bunkers and towers don't buff the end bosses in this version to be the most confusing. Wasn't that a thing in 1.12 AV? Would bump games up to around 15mins minimum, I would think.
---
What's the point of holding them? Til AV weekend pops or?
---
Shit this is TBC classic? Thought i played the re-release of vanilla.
---
&gt; Ive been wanting to see a Boomkin tank myself.
---
I've tanked as a boomkin raid tank on pservers for a while now. Is there something you want to know in particular?
---
It doesn't matter to Alliance. They'll win every AV and Horde will only play AV for the huge honor. Horde won't queue for other BGs if they want high ranks.
---
Asmon didn't have to pay attention in SM because he's handed everything by his followers
---
Thanks.
---
I'll give tribute runs a shot I guess, I've got almost 200 in engineering to make those c4rium charges.
---
I just disabled all addons but a select few. Tsm was giving me problems so I‚Äôll turn it on after they figure out what‚Äôs going on.
---
Ah well, thats a shame.
---
This is why most twinks avoid the 19 bracket. Its horribly boring to play seeing as you only have half your kit, no mount, and have to deal with people like that.
---
I'll stick to the 49s thank you very much!
---
you think the blue pvp helmet is better than t2?
---
What INTERFACE ADDON for your spells do you use?
---
Blizzard is just a dead company by now. Think about it: people pay money to be able to play a game in it's previous state. And even THAT they fuck up. They just suck so damn hard, it should be told to everyone working for Blizzard day in and out how shit they actually are.
---
Like 80% of PuGs, at least on my server, are 30 players from a guild and 10 randoms, that are the "casual guilds". Loot distribution still takes forever, trash pulls take forever, there's the odd wipe at Geddon or Majordomus, and Raggi always takes stupid amounts of time to explain, set up and then still takes 2 to disband amount of tries. Good groups I had manage roughly 3 hours, terrible ones took 4 hours to reach Raggi and gave up there. 
---
Those are the raiding experiences of like 50%+ of players. I know from my guild raids it can be much, much faster and easier, but acting like MC is a free clear for anyone reaching 60 is just bullshit. You need to find one of those good guilds who always have ~40 players of their own to clear MC, and then get a raid spot there. Otherwise it's "LFR" for 1 hours, then another half an hour to gather the raid and get everyone in discord, followed by a 3-4 hour MC excursion that ends up with a Ragnaros kill in a bit more than half of the runs.
---
Far too many people either never experienced i and only heard stories of "the good ole days", or clearly don't remember how shit went.
---
I remember doing world pvp either in TM/SS or trying to raid crossroads to get horde to come out as a random thing we did.  We didn't do it for honor, we did it because we were bored.  We'd do it for an hour or two and leave when it got boring.  It wasn't something we HAD to do, it was something we did to kill time.
---
People now HAVE to do it to rank up.  I hear people talk about these epic TM/SS wars as if it was something constant and on going.  We did it for a few hours, not even every day and then went back about sitting afk in IF.  I don't know where these people are getting the idea of what glorious world pvp was like, but I never experienced what they said I did.
---
I like how everyone on reddit has a masters in economics, marketing and business. You seem to have all three, very impressive. Please, oh wise one, tell us morons what the investors want to hear?
---
Well TUF is going to be better than most 2H they got from MC so far if they didn't get lucky with Bonereavers or Sulfuras so I don't really blame them for wanting to rep grind it out ASAP before queues inevitable slow down.
---
I'd also guess that it's aimed at Q1, but that's still a 3 month time period. Your speculations have some sound logic behind them, and I partly agree with you.
---
But in the end, it's only that - speculation and guesswork. We'll just have to wait and see.
---
I played 5 games last night and won two of them.
---
Presumably it was to prevent exactly that. Dumb I know
---
There was also a great deal of cross-server trading going on in AV yesterday. That's what the restart was for.
---
There was a pretty big flux of high value items from low pop to high pop servers.
---
I don't buy that. Sure some streamers can be very toxic and self centered. But even if we accept, for the sake of the argument, that every streamer is that kind of huge asshole I still think they only make up a small single digit percentage of today's Classic players.
---
This is a general attitude problem which changed during the last 15 years. That change happened slowly but rather uniformly. You can observer the same kind of attitude in pretty much every modern multiplayer game today.
---
So it's really not surprising players today will play the same 15 year old game much differently. And since the game is more or less the same, we of course notice the change A LOT more. Because this is one of the few examples where we can observe how players, of more or less the same player segment, approach and influence the same game with half a generation gap or experience.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt get the honor gripe. You don‚Äôt compete against the other faction for ranks, so who gives a shit about the honor gains lol, unfortunately AV is just a rep grind fest, and will probably be abandoned once everyone hits exalted.
---
And the alliance are happy you have short queue times, it‚Äôs a win win scenario.
---
It feels like they want to fuck up this game and us on purpose
---
I don't know how much of a gold sink it is just as you don't know how many people use it or not. 
---
I have no proof it will hurt the economy and you have no proof it won't.
---
It will still make the game worse for me since I don't get the reward for knowing I'm always gonna have my best specc while some people won't have that. So you are still wrong that the game will be the same and there are only good things to come from this.
---
What a pointless thing to get upset about lol
---
Killing mobs inside AV and turning in quests will give you EXP.
---
Yeah, absolutely. The pserver players in my guild just had me going full conspiracy theorist lol.
---
i dont understant whats the issue?
---
I think you get more rep when winning, but the honor gains are better for Horde if you don't try to win and kill Balinda + Lieutenants.
---
I like to grab four guys and sit at the stormpike chokepoint and stun/net/slow horde as they run by. Best case for us, it turns into a long turtle. Best case for the rest of the team it delays the horde enough for an uncontested win. 
---
Either way they'll complain but it's fun pvp.
---
Making me laught all those kids like you Who cant conteign themself in front of true fact , even if its bad writed .
---
So 100 wins for non-humans lol.
---
that's a good question, maybe when in cata hunters got that talent to tame core hounds, it included being able to tame exotic stuff and that functionality carried over or something. I wouldnt know anyways.
---
Another vote for going in blind. There‚Äôs something magical about knowing absolutely nothing.
---
If you let people know that you‚Äôre new, most of the time they‚Äôre happy to pass down knowledge to you, especially in dungeons. And you get to experience a lovely full circle moment when you pass that knowledge down to other newbies later on!
---
Also, don‚Äôt be shy about creating a liberal amount of toons! It‚Äôs great for understanding other classes, seeing new places and getting access to more lore. Playing a different race, or even faction is like playing a whole new game.
---
If you're bad enough to fall for these tricks, you're too bad to play AV
---
PvE PvE PvE
---
PvP servers sound fun. The constant danger of a gank. Seeing an someone from the opposing faction, will they attack? Will they pass me by?
---
The reality is that on most highly populated PvP servers any zone 48+ you will die on sight and there will always be people looking for you to kill you. 48-60 levelling will likely need to be done in dungeons.  
---
It will take you 3+ deaths minimum to get into BRD/BRS. Potentially even more if there happens to be a raid holding the mountain.   
---
You can never go to contested zones to just farm or chill, because there's almost always someone there who will kill you.
---
Roll PvE the first time round. Then you can choose to level a PvP toon if you want after.
---
I'm Horde so the important question for me is.... how much rep do I get per loss?
---
oh ok, so you won't be upset when I need your BoP upgrade so that I can vendor it for a few silver?  good to know
---
Yes... I understand that buy the person I was replying to specifically said:
---
&gt; people say it works for Classic as well which is how pre-mades are getting into AV/WSG
---
Notice the obvious mention of WSG? That's why I said it.
---
Did we actually figure out what Blizzard patched last night around 8:30/8:45 est?
---
Was it cross server trading?
---
This might blow you mind, but different people enjoy different play styles.
---
Aye, I just didn't find any longterm enjoyment from those battles as they mostly involved uncoordinated zerging and using overwhelming numbers. It also utterly sucks for melees as going in is usually a deathsentence unless you are only picking off people at the outskirts, which kind of devaluates the concept of participating in massive battles.
---
He didn't afk level his warrior in dungeons.  Only his alts.  I get that you want to hate the guy but facts are facts.
---
It's people who can't compete at 60 :)
---
The honor grind has just begun. People aren‚Äôt even in the 10s yet it‚Äôs gonna be another 2 months till we see high ranks
---
Shift-space brings up the list of who's in the BG and there should also be a Leave Battleground button, too.
---
lul :D
---
meltdowns like this are why I browse /new
---
Rogue player, and raid frames bigger than mine - what is going on?? 
---
My Grid2-frame roughly spans the area from your Garrote to the empty button under Ghostly Strike, and reaches somewhere up to your stealth button-ish. And I'm a healer!
---
Oh god I use to love seeing this, its harmless and hilarious
---
Glad to have you back! Hope you can keep enjoying the game:)
---
Report and move on.
---
What add on are you using for character stats and item level?
---
&gt;you can clearly hear Asmon's stream on the backgroud
---
can you provide some clips?, i missed that completely
---
Probably so..I did not see many sites that had them. We have a couple of yhose robes ,and I can't believe they still sell them. They are so badly made.
---
I was saying this to my buddies last night. Saving 100g each week now until I'm exalted with av.
---
You get as significant amount of awards from finishing the game win or lose, if you defend the game becomes a tug of war, I had a game last over 45 min last night, it would been massively better for a side to lose 5 seven min games then to win that single battle.
---
The salt it real..just need like everyone. Its a green, if 30 of you greed and 5 need, yall fcked...so just need.
---
You kind can.  But paradoxically, the #nochanges crowd is preventing the game from being more authentic to its roots.
---
No Shit sherlock. And I dont enjoy spamming frostbolt and so do a lot of other mages. My point was, for them it might not be about optimization, like everyone claims here, it might be because it is just more fun to aoe mobs.
---
&gt; Step 1. Invite a warrior Step 2. Have the warlock summon the warrior Step 3. Warrior tanks
---
Step 4. Realize that warrior tanking is boring and doesn't bring a challenge and further trivialises a 15 year old game and have the warlock tank again :)
---
Yes, the 1.12 patch had CRBGs. It's literally nochanges and people still find a way to bitch.
---
Maybe I'm just way more lucky than you are. But I don't share that experience. The majority of my dungeon runs are rather relaxed and smooth.
---
OH NO NOT TRASH GREENS!!?!?!? MONSTERS
---
or maybe, just maybe, those 5 are lvl 53's who actually need that upgrade
---
Since you are a hunter, this is also your best gold grind.
---
No need to run normal trib runs. You clear it solo faster then a group.
---
Absolutely this. You should be hard farming BRD til 58/60, then strat/scholo/BRD til 60.
---
Look up BRD bis guides but youre pretty much lookin for arena and a few things from the prison area, golem lord, and angerforge for now. Advertise which bosses youre doing in lfg because almost noone runs the whole thing anyways. Kill what was advertised, reset, fill in whoever leaves, keep doing.
---
The first few will be miserable and youre gonna get some PTSD even when running around corners in major cities from BRD. Once you get geared and used to it youll be able to make your runs smooth as butter.
---
Goodluck
---
Rams aren't that bad. Better than Ford's.
---
I hate this so much. World PvP got old real quick because it was always either running around rolling over single players or small groups, or being alone and getting rolled over. Now we finally have BGs for proper fair PvP, but the BG where you actually play PvP is dead because it gives less honor than the PvE rush without any PvP elements. 
---
Like, if you leave this shitty AV version in the game, at least make it worse honor-wise. Then people who want to just farm rep or a bit of afk-honor in PvE spec can still go there, but the rest of the players gets at least a bit of vanilla-like PvP action.
---
It wasn't a lengthy shutdown though.
---
This was basic shit already back in 2007 tbc arenas?
---
Coming from others competitive game this makes no sense to me! So basically highest ranked people will not have necessarily good skills, but just the longest playtime/highest games played?
---
Well, as horde you win about 20% of the time, so I wouldn't count on getting the rep gains that some people are calculating here.
---
Unfortunately no it doesn‚Äôt :( wsg is far less honor per hour than this Zerg AV. Unless they change something AV will be the way to rank which really sucks.
---
Ebbnflow has your resto druid needs.
---
Just wondering... when was the last time your Druid used a Polearm? .... ?
---
Was in AV until 1am. Had to be at work at 7am...it's gonna be a long day
---
Might not be the most optimal one but I'm really comfortable with it to be honest!
---
bonethugz
---
Yeah totally. And I guess that's why they give us these vague timelines, so they can release content when they think it's needed and not be bound to an arbitrary timeline (the content has already been made right? They just choose when to release it).
---
Personally I'd be fine with it coming much later, I guess we'll see.
---
Leatrix Plus / Dominos
---
Where do you buy the AV gear/off hands?
---
Being politely informed that you're banned from something you didn't want to be a part of anyway lol.
---
"Sorry, you've been deemed unworthy of cancer"
---
Alliance can end game in around 7 min, our premade gets it in like 6 since everyone has epic mount. Rep farm is primary reason ppl are doing it
---
You are telling me a shadow priest or feral Druid can outheal a Ret pally? I have yet to see it. 
---
And holy pallies still out heal resto Druids and holy priests. While the latter two might provide better raid heals, holy pallies are still always the top of the healing meters due to healing efficiency especially during a long fight.
---
Downvote me if you want but that‚Äôs the game. R14 weapons are big.
---
How much are Freezing Bands going for on your server?
---
I don‚Äôt have much AH history to go by on mine.....
---
Yeah when people that are actually good at the game are willing to carry you for a drop of clout it's pretty easy to get those titles lmao
---
Jesus - I legit teared up at this. Happy for your happiness now, brother.
---
what a bloody ninja, did he even ask for a roll?
---
&gt;So much for classic people are nicer narrative.
---
Who has ever said this? 
---
Was it the guy ganking people at the NPC to turn in a timed elite mob quest so people would fail and time out, before honor was enabled, for no reason other than to grief people?
---
how do you suggest playing 80 person battle?  Also what does an 80 person battle show...the most skilled?  the most tactical mob mentality? 
---
Are you going to get better at PVP?  Is it fun trying  to avoid being targetted by a swarm of people?
---
Like what the fuck would you get out of a different AV experience?
---
The game is 15 years old, with a dev team scared to change anything, and a ownership group trying to figure out how to monetize without pissing off the returning players.
---
There are plenty of competitive games out there, WoW classic AV 80 man battles isn't one of them. Get over it.
---
There are fucktons of things that were changed.
---
Replied to the wrong person my bad
---
You just can't abuse WSG (or AB) the way you an abuse AV. Simply because you actually play against the other team, if they got your flag "run faster, more PvE deeps" doesn't help, you have to engage. 
---
The solution is very easy, make AV terrible for honor gain. Maybe on par with losing WSG in random groups. People will still go for the rep and a more chill semi-afk honor grind, but the PvP action will be in the proper BGs.
---
I really wish people would understand this.  Every AV match people are bitching about "play defense so we get more honor!" when they don't realize that they're never getting r13.  The AV rep rewards are available to everyone that gets the rep.
---
5 reports, even if you are in combat, kicks you for afking IIRC.
---
So? My father played a 19 twink for years and years, it's why he loved WoW. He really struggled once they killed twinking, and doesn't play anymore.
---
700-800g Horde side Shazzrah EU
---
Too bad they didn‚Äôt listen, because. 1.12 was a ‚Äúchanged‚Äù AV. The people pushing for Classic wanted the 1.5 pre-change AV.
---
It‚Äôs kinda funny though watching these ‚Äúhardcore PvPers‚Äù with their high ranks avoiding PvP, keyboard-turning their way to victory.
---
He asked if it's possible to level through AV, it is, just no efficient.
---
He told me he was the only able to need/greed it apparently!
---
I'm doing holy/protect hybrid build, going after holy shield.
---
shite....good point!!!! Been using maces and Staffs to level! Oh well, need to wait till Exhalted!!! dammmmit ...haha 
---
THank you for helping this noob! :)
---
Thanks. I do like the shield block and disarm in the protect line though.
---
Hello Classicals,
---
im thinking about both rolling a shaman and a druid as alts, one should learn alchemy and one leatherworking. which combos are better?
---
Please bring arena. It was the saviour of the working man.
---
its the rep for stormpike that mostly leads to the good gear
---
i'm finally free to go to ZF from gadgetzan as horde now. good thing alliance players have somewhere else to go to farm honor other than my 48
---
In the alpha all instance entrances were dark portals (modelwise). Thats the reason for the underwater one in azshara since there was an instance planned but later cut.
---
Getting my main (shammy) and druid mixed up now. Thanks for pointing that out...... :D
---
I don't even have a level 60 yet. :(
---
There is no raid group outside Bahsing Se.
---
I was completely new as well! After trying a few classes, I can say that hunters are very newbie friendly. Having a pet buffers a lot of your mistakes, and there aren‚Äôt that many buttons to press. It‚Äôs also great for solo levelling, if you‚Äôre limited on time.
---
The problem is not with germans but spanish (one medium realm), russia and french (4-4 realms each prob)
---
&gt; Don Rodrigos
---
Unless you're doing nature damage for some reason or always in a raid that never has the right curses up, Rodrigo's is maybe a marginal side-grade compared to some of the prebis rings for a mage/lock. Even then Ring of Spell Power, Band of Forced Concentration next phase, and to a lesser extent the ZG set of rings in the phase after (They'll be better as the set but even as a set they're likely not as good as double Spell Power or Spell Power + Forced Concentration until you have a huge amount of spellpower elsewhere). It's good but the 20 penetration isn't so big a deal that you keep it forever unless you've decided to raid as an ele shaman. The bigger thing from AV is the caster off hands, which until you get staff of the shadow flame are going to be hanging around for a while (and perhaps even after depending on what one-handed caster weapons drop for you).
---
No veins or herbs.
---
says the guy using numbers as letters in his name.
---
Ah okay, what exactly is your plan though, are you going to be healing in raids? Tanking 5 mans? Just prot spec for aoe farming low level instances?
---
Those guilds sound like assholes.
---
You need to stop looking at #nochanges like it was some kind of intelligent point of view. It was the easiest thing to shout because you didn't have to think about details. If you actually tried to sit down and design 1.13 as a true hybrid of various points in Vanilla, you'd never settle on anything. No two players have the same definition of the proper version of "Classic" and trying to reconcile everything is impossible. What we'd end up with would not be any version of WoW that ever existed on live servers.
---
The only way Classic could be fixed is by branching off and making what would essentially be a new game. Not Retail, and not Vanilla, but something else. Closer to vanilla but there are a lot of reasons why actual vanilla is a terrible thing to release in 2020. We all see that clear as day now.
---
You have 40 people. Five defenders really isn‚Äôt much when they‚Äôre going after at least 30 players of the opposing faction.
---
Yes because we definitely were running 1.12 AV when MC was the best gear available in the game, that's vanilla accurate
---
"just let the alliance win" is definitely how a BG should work.  Definitely means your mechanics aren't broken in some way.
---
they get a 10 min debuff, where they cant enter another BG, but thats it.
---
The gear you want will be from AV, which is bracketed to 51-60.  Otherwise there are a few pieces from WSG that you could start working on as well, however WSG popularity will not fall off as fast as AV will.   
---
Once people reach rep ranks with Stormpike, many alliance will just stop queues for AV as it's all they are after.   This will be when the Queue timers show up for the Horde side as they will not be max rep in the same time frames.

Physically demanding jobs usually require a lot of cognitive functions that if you fuck it up it‚Äôs not as simple as a few backspaces or a phone call. Moving a roll of steel from a floor to a rail car in a steel mill requires anywhere from 75 to 100 different motions of your hand along with needing to pay a lot of attention since you‚Äôre lobbying around tons of steel above people‚Äôs heads.
---
There‚Äôs also a matter of while you may be able to slug through a low impact labor job on very little brain power and zombie mode. Most of them you won‚Äôt.
---
If you are automated afking, via macros, software etc, you will be reviewed after enough reports, if they catch you in the act you'll be temp banned. These types are usually standing still right clicking or jumping. Ban duration increases every time.
---
If you are botting you will be banned in waves. Typically long temp or perm. But can take a while for the Bans to be issued as blizzard usually do these in waves.
---
If you are just leaving the keyboard for 5 minutes and leave the match with an auto kick, you get a 15 min deserter where you cannot enter for 15 minutes.  No other penalty given. Same goes for just leaving the match.
---
That's pretty good but you forgot Smite!
---
This AV is a joke. That rep grind was brutal the first time around, having to pick up those armor scraps and actually having to pvp to progress. Such is life, I suppose.
---
You obviously never played on  Private servers.
---
After 10 years of playing WoW with Russians and Chinese on Private Servers, I can tell you that Russians only understand and speak Russian  and Chinese only understand and speak Chinese.
---
If it's a Russian then it's a load of   –¥—Ñ—Å–¥—Å—Ñ—Å–¥—Ñ–∞—Ñ–¥—Å–≥–¥—Ñ—Å–¥—Å—Å–¥ when you speak English to them and if it's a China then it's gonna be  Êº¢Â≠ó  when you speak English to them.
---
You are welcome.
---
Haha no worries. I still forget that my warlock alt can use one-handed swords.
---
I just farmed to honored in the morning as 54. Yes I was not as effective as others with bis raid gear, but I got a big polearm, and 3 rares. Next time I will join as 59 or 60
---
I had that revelation yesterday ha. I was like why am I rushing to exalted to get the top gear if it‚Äôs not to then continue playing the same thing, esp in AV where you being super geared hardly matters
---
Ret pallys suck
---
If both teams zerg the last boss without capping a single GY/Tower, the alliance have the advantage. They can get there faster and deal with less NPC's while doing so. If you zerg as Horde and win, (it happens plenty) it's because the Ally messed up and either not enough of them zerg'd or they made a bad pulled and too many died or just completely wiped. If all 40 from each team are equally geared/skilled and all go straight to the boss, Ally will always win. 
---
Horde seem to do 2 things mostly, just accept the lose and kill Belinda for bonus rep, and sometimes still win because Ally fucked up. Or some of them will play defense and actually wipe the Ally. Games where Ally win in 6 minutes, they don't even half cap the GY. Horde can easily just respawn there and attempt to wipe them. If successful, Ally are fucked and will respawn too far away to recoup. 
---
With no way to make premade raids, it's completely random what your team will do.
---
a 60 mage would just aoe for him while he sat back. sm cath you only have to move once after the hallway to get all honor
---
Efficient av gives 22k an hour.
---
Isn¬¥t this integrated into DBM?
---
or is it missing in the classic version?
---
Have you tried DBM?
---
I would say just that there is logical thing that person who pick horde chars are much more mature and older, but also kinda more agressive... who plays night elves and dwarfs? those old romantics that were 10 year old kids when wow started. and serious players simply doesnt want to be with kids. all in all, even if number show 50-50, activity is big part of feeling, and horde is far more active, so you feel like its 20-80.
---
but there is one thing that blizzard can do to start help... 1st of all they need to correct Theramore/Menethil ports. Unlike horde hub that is protected, we can travel to other continent only through ungarded cities... On flamelash horde would simply take dock and ships... there was no any way u travel to other continent for 6-8hour period!!!
---
so current av is points based again ? i havent been able to log on today ...
---
I‚Äôve encountered the same with plenty of greens. Not sure how loot works in bgs
---
If you kill mobs you get raid exp (15-25exp)
---
Quest turn-ins. 
---
Thats about it.
---
And some want to play the game the way it‚Äôs intended to be played. The minmaxers can cry all they want. They‚Äôre trying to speed up a game that‚Äôs purposefully a time sink and ruining the experience for everyone else.
---
There would be plenty to sweaty #nochanges people to ree about it for a day or two, all the while they'd continue individually AV like normal.
---
I mean the first months were great. Some people just have too high expectations and believe it would just continue being their most nostalgic dream ever.
---
Good shout dude!
---
Is this blizzards subtle way of making BFA happen? üòÇ
---
You seem extremely invested in what this random guy on the internet says and does, you should probably work on not doing that.
---
Sorry but this is a dumb comment
---
No its not
---
Pls nerf av its so borring
---
heirlooms killed it for me, thats when I decided to level up (my twink was also my main lol)
---
What is the macro command to change the macro icon? I want to change it to match the weapon I'm equipping.
---
Hi, I'm new to wow, why am I seeing comments about horde always losing to alliance? Aren't horde better at pvp because of their racial also there's more hardcore gamers in that faction, so why aren't they winning?
---
what is cappin GY and why does alliance have an advantage?
---
Most probably very time consuming. People are rushing the game, and if you want to be able to do something interesting you will have to follow more or less.
---
Thanks, I will continue enjoying the game for what it is.
---
I‚Äôve heard it called that by many groups of people for over a decade but ok
---
You needed better parents.
---
Too bad alliance just wants to rush drek
---
I'm team "warts and all", which means smashing both buttons at the same time.
---
What if you, hyphothetically, play at work, so you have the game open in a small window, but you check it every few minutes and make some kind of action, to keep the game active?
---
Thank you! U think it s better than bartender?
---
I find it quite limited
---
Pretty sure those rewards won‚Äôt come out until the AQ or Naxx patch.
---
I mean, you dont need to read patch notes to see the difference lol.
---
Warlock if you don‚Äôt want to deal with kiting. Hunter if you‚Äôre on with kiting
---
The reason people like me dont want any changes is not that we feel that the game couldn't be improved. It's that for example the most common change i see people asking for is dual spec. Which i fucking despise. So if i was to open up the game to changes, I would be afraid that it would be one of the most popular ones.
---
Or re-balancing classes. Hate that change too. But i bet that most people playing right now wouldn't mind if boomkins got a little extra mana regen.
---
So that's not to say that i wouldn't change SOME things. I'd make MC much harder. Add a few mechanics. I'd make epic mounts 10x as expensive. I'd nerf certain farming spots. I'd nerf many items and buff others. But it's easier for me to just say #nochanges because i know I cant decide all this stuff alone anyways.
---
I'm warlock though... I want rank 10 gear specifically...
---
Nonsense. Look at the events that occurred during Cataclysm. Azeroth lived on
---
u/Forcedcontainment how are they displaying full enemy health ... my real mob health addon doesnt work on players, just shows their hp as 100 if they are not in my group ....
---
This comment killed me man hahaha everyone complaining about WoW right now should be sentenced to 99 rc
---
Quartermaster outside the AV entrance (outside the cave on the left if you're alliance).  They'll only show the gear that is available at your rep level, so you won't see the off hands until you're exalted.
---
So does your ability to provide a meaningful contribution to the discussion.
---
Yea well that's just the thing you understand it cant be paused because you play. She doesnt get that. Funnily enough if I was mid Netflix episode she probably would wait for me to finish because that's something she understands.l and the submersion
---
I think ima skip work to Av.
---
I do not want content that scales by gear, level, or any other way. I want to be able to out gear or out level things and feel powerful like all of my progression has meant something. Also when you have content that scales it diminishes the agency of this "World" that we're a part of and makes it just another video game/ride(ie Retail)
---
Ye sure, but there's also a big difference between that and those games that last for hours. Every game beyond 1h becomes tedious very quickly imo.
---
Lock alts are great, and summons pretty much make it the clear leader
---
10% bonus on your final stats after all other modifiers.
---
Man I love that sort of thing. I randomly joined a BRD group when I was a 58 priest, eager to heal. The other 4 were from the same guild and knew each other. They weren't geared that well, but they were helping another guildies get attuned for Onyxia. We start, and our paladin tank says "Okay, big pull, need big heals. Bubble please!"
---
[internally panics in shadow]
---
Dude pulls a bunch of packs of dogs and dwarves, and I hit him with renew and spam flash heals while our mage aoe's them down. I was at maybe half mana, and didn't even let him get near death. 
---
"You had me worried when you said big heals. I'm shadow, but that was nothing."
---
"...You're shadow? How do you heal like that in shadow?"
---
Anyway, that's the story of how after 3 pulls I was recruited to a high tier raiding guild, met a bunch of dudes who are family, who I run with every day, and now I'm on a first name basis with. Now that we've geared up and I'm holy, sometimes we do BRD for the hell of it, where the pally drinks a swiftness potion and pulls the entire front room of BRD while we laugh and prepare to loot a mountain of corpses.
---
The worst thing about the 19 bracket is the only BG available is WSG. As a Druid the 30-39 bracket was always my favorite, because then you at least get to play Arathi Basin, and druids are king with our travel form before everybody else gets their mounts.
---
Yeah man! Stop enjoying yourself!!!!!
---
Mines and mine layer, make endboss actually be buffed by towers/WM like he's supposed to be, and potentially link WM so they can't be separated.   No more rushes.  Average game would be 20-30mins and more importantly there would be higher potential for fighting back.
---
I've actually notices we've been getting comparable rep to alliance.  Always have a bunch of people turning in armor scraps and stuff.
---
Look up Moonfury PVP builds, modify as required.   My gear is full MC/Ony though.  It's hilarious having moonfire spammable for 800 damage and Starfire crits in the 2000-2300 range.    I basically run around healing the group in BGs and dropping massive nukes on near dead or dumbasses who give chase. 
---
What's really fun is to run around in cheetah form and honor hungry players chase you thinking that your a new 60 and don't have a mount yet.   I bait people off the main Zerg in AV like this every match then kill them.  Warriors and mages especially, they are always the greedy ones and go down so fast.
---
Shit, and here I hoped to stay in the 40s to avoid twinks.
---
Did 25 people get paid, or did nobody get paid?
---
Queue times must be good for horde because there was only 1 Horde in Gankistan last night which is incredibly different than it being a terrorist war zone in the Middle East a day ago
---
like what? the no changes crew was against stupid stuff like revamping the talent trees, buying xp increases and stuff like that
---
I am one of them, and I was for buffing raid boss hp because I knew they'd fall over too easily with 1.12 talents and 16 debuff slots. I was for keeping the integrity of the game, but I was not for turning it into a ezmode retail hybrid like a lot of people were asking for
---
The person that did it raids at the same time as us. They knew about every guild that was raiding. It's not about 'owning' the quest or even the buff itself. It's about communicating and sharing with the other people that are playing the game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX7ehxyYRQc
---
&gt; Kinda ruins some games...
---
ah but you wanna afk at work
---
True enough,
---
Retail is more fun than classic lmao
---
cough* Pursuit of Justice cough*
---
If you started with a previously created character funneling you gold, yeah.
---
Are any of these rewards good for healers at all? Seems like there are much better items out of dire maul and strat.
---
In sm u can get 70k+ a hr .. If u have a full grp of lowbies + a lvl60 since the EXP. From dungeons is based on the avg lvl of the grp.
---
Submit a ticked.
---
It's a bannable offense for people to be targeting others and mass reporting them like this.
---
You can do it by using a countdown in voice chat. LOL
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, I was in an SM group the other day (I joined because it was advertised Armory but then they wanted to do all 4 wings) and it was a sad reminder of why I should always tank and set the right pace.  We were Lv34-38 and did SM GY first and the tank wanted to pull Lv30 mobs one at a fucking time.  FFS I tanked a group 5 with a 2H weapon just fine because we overleveled it so much
---
so sorry I think you should actually have to earn rep like any other faction. people will grind out the stupidest rep for months, but they want to get all their AV rep in a few days
---
No
---
Lol. I had the same thing. Kept counting down how many B/s I was downloading
---
Easy to not please everyone when you please no one.
---
&gt; Killing any pack which is skippable is a noob move and waste of time.
---
This pisses me off in retail to no end. Takes less than a minute to kill the 2 mobs you wanna skip. Just murder them, lazy fucks!! üò°
---
For the record yes, I'm usually the guy in the 5-man who's never seen or heard of whatever ideal route this skip refers to. I don't spend my time reading how to speed through games. I spend my time playing them.
---
Didn‚Äôt the no changes come from lack of faith in blizzard? They wanted no changes because they didn‚Äôt want blizzard to make it worse. Better the devil you know type of thing.
---
I‚Äôve reached a moment in my life where I worked my ass off, saved up money to leave my shit job to do pretty much anything I want, and then came to the conclusion that I honestly have no idea what I want and I don‚Äôt know what makes me happy so I‚Äôve been in limbo for about a year wondering what the fuck to do. And it‚Äôs really weird and kinda depressing.
---
So if you look on the elvui forums they will tell you to disable all other addons and see if the issue persists and that‚Äôs what I did. Elvui was then working so it‚Äôs probably a conflict with another add on although I haven‚Äôt taken the time to figure that out.
---
The main reason it died is because Blizzard created a second bracket for ‚Äúxp-off‚Äù players so they weren‚Äôt matched with regular players. That took the queues from once an hour to once a *day.* Nobody hops on their twink to hang around the capital waiting all day for a queue to pop, so most people lost interest.
---
So just like in every game, twinks are just people that aren‚Äôt good enough at the game to consistently compete against fully leveled/geared players.
---
Why? If they released the content tomorrow naxx would be down in a month
---
But do they give rep
---
Assuming Classic servers will keep existing, you can probably take your time with nearly everything and still experience it all, the only thing you won't be able to do is rank 14.
---
"Downvoted and flamed" literally has 1.276 likes, and a lot of the comments including the first ones are agreeing
---
Maybe the solution would be to make the R13/14 gear buyable just like at the end of vanilla. Even playng field for all who want to PvP.
---
Are any of the new battlegrounds rewards good for healers? Those rings look great for physical and caster DPS, but it seems healers were left out?
---
Naw, I know about it myself, just would like to see it on vanilla servers for the goofs.
---
I had honestly forgotten about the late vanilla rush to the end meta I'm AV.
---
Some guilds do MC in 30 mintues, never mind of 2 hours. 2 hour clears are well above average
---
After you get exalted with AV how much gold does it cost to get the mount + training? Is there anything else you need to have in order to purchase?
---
 It haven‚Äôt you encountered some awesome people?  Isn‚Äôt it fun to hang out with your guildies?  You hang out, do some BGs, do some raids, dungeons, and agree to hang out again later.  
---
You can‚Äôt expect everyone to be great.  Find your great friends
---
Though if they're having issues killing Rag then they will absolutely have issues with DPS on Vael.
---
I saw this so much with OSRS. Games like Castle wars were packed, low level mage accounts heavily populated ftp pvp, the world was alive. Now tons of players are in instances areas farming the best gear in the game, half the content sits there unused because it isn't efficient or doesn't give strong gear. Almost nobody is alone in the wilderness, why have an actual interesting fair fight when you can bring a second person and have advantages even in 1v1 areas of the wilderness.
---
People don't want to waste or lose time anymore. While castle wars is fun, when you have thousands of hours of progression that you feel you need to do (whether it is to play with a streamer or a friend) it can make the more interesting parts of the game seem less enjoyable.
---
While I think 5 hour AV sound insanely fun, I think a very large majority of players would complain that it would take too long to get rep for the gear that it brought into the game.
---
Do LBRS (8 runs MAX, probably closer to 5 or 6) to 58 then Strat 6 times from 58-60. Boom, you 60.
---
You‚Äôve got 19 days to take off.  You get sick one day and have to take 1 day off of work, you now have 18.  You take a 4 day vacation, you now have 14 days left.  You get sick again, but it‚Äôs not going away so you have to take 5 days off, you now have 9 days left.
---
Yes, I live in America.  My company would probably work with me if I was out of PTO and needed to take a sick day, but that‚Äôs not the norm.  Believe it or not, 19 days of PTO is pretty good.
---
&gt;is your absolute favorite thing in vanilla speed killing the av boss? That's what you plan on doing every free second even if there's no rewards?
---
first you must answer my question. if the answer is anything except yes, then you're too dumb to see how dumb your comment is
---
see I plan on playing AV after I hit exalted, I enjoy that bg. so shouldn't my opinion count just as much if not more than someone who only plays that bg the minimal times and never wants to play it ?
---
Gladiator isn't difficult and he isn't awful on a warrior.
---
try it
---
Yes, America.  19 days PTO ain‚Äôt too bad here believe it or not.
---
Well said
---
You don't need dal rend's for raiding...
---
Right?! And when they finally capitulated to releasing Bgs early they omit AB which is everyone‚Äôs favorite....
---
yeah idk /shrug
---
What do you mean? you can buy the AV exalted stuff.
---
Yes, but other Horde will be doing AV.
---
Ooo, doin' them dirty.
---
Depends on your server as well I guess. My guild isn‚Äôt hardcore. People in it behave mature. And even though we are very casual we have MC and Ony on farm for some time already.
---
Why not?
---
What do you think your W/L rate was?
---
That's easy to say, and easy to believe, but meaningless unless you have hard evidence for it. I've seen people who have tested this a lot cite that the Thrash Blade proc increases your overall DPS by about 2.8% in pre-raid BiS gear, which is pretty close to what you would expect from a weapon that gives you about 4% more autoattacks (since autoattacks make up about 50% of your damage). In any case, I guarantee you any warrior will deal higher net DPS with any of the three weapons I linked than they will with Thrash Blade.
---
The amount of rage you gain from the 4-5% extra attacks you get from the proc is completely and utterly insignificant. You'll gain way more rage, especially in Fury spec, by just using a faster weapon, and even the effect of that is fairly minuscule and generally not worth worrying about. I mean, think of it this way: [[Cho'Rush's Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18484/chorushs-blade) has the same damage range as Thrash Blade, but because of the 2.4 speed instead of 2.7 you're getting *12%* extra attacks! Oh boy!
---
The two first ones sound pretty disturbing. We handle signups via discord, but think signups are open to a few hours prior to pull time. Late signers might risk getting benched though - but that one sounds most normal of the three bullet points you presented. I personally think that organization is good for raid schedules and comps.
---
Yup, America. 19 days PTO ain‚Äôt too bad here.
---
- June 7, 2005: original AV released
---
- August 22, 2006: when current AV changes with x-realm queues existed
---
- December 5, 2006: honor system ends
---
What we are getting is the very very tail end of the honor system, which *everyone* hated back then. Everyone stopped grouping, stopped playing with friends, stopped playing WSG, stopped playing AB, and did nothing but this nonsense because they had no choice.
---
If this is not changed, I imagine it will be a death sentence. People are not going to enjoy nothing but raid logging old content for a year because they chose to use the most fucked phase of the PvP system.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, these people are freeloading honor toward this week‚Äôs ranking. So I guess we know all those ranks are artificial and those ‚Äúhardcore PvPers‚Äù are just posers with vanity nameplates that mean nothing.
---
So what's the deal with queing as a group for AV?  My friend tried to que us as a group but no luck. Although I see in chat, people looking for more for AV.
---
So you want to mount up, press W for 5 mins, cast a few spells on a general then press "leave battleground". Do that again 20 times and feel accomplished? What?
---
I think you've just been very unlucky!!!
---
Wild idea. Make the PvP stuff buyable via honor like at the end of vanilla. Maybe increase prices. Then everybody has the same gear and PvP is fair.
---
I think u should change the game to little pony or something. Jesus ppl these days are such softy snowflakes.
---
So beeing exalted is the only requirement? a‚Äòight
---
Hmm, there are great guilds out there but you do have to search around. That said, signing up for raids is very common and necessary in a lot of ways and I don't think you'll find a raiding guild that doesn't do that.
---
A friend of mine play quite a few matched yesterday (6 hours or so) and is almost through honored already as Horde. So, in less than a week if you play regularly seems likely.
---
Because there are plenty of other weapons that work just fine?
---
Hunting for dal rend's is fine if you want to, but expecting people to have them for raiding is crazy.
---
I managed to run completely up and down Felwood and was only killed once (while at a quest giver, no less) .
---
So... better.
---
you mean... they'd PVP?
---
yeah you wsg for honor and av for rep and honor during av weekend, it shouldnt be meta for honor when it's pure pve in pve spec lmao
---
So it wasn't just me!
---
I tried setting the graphics card, still no fix :/
---
This was in Vanilla too. It always made me play harder to win. 
---
(yes I know its less efficient for Honor, but surprise! I'm not a min maxer)
---
You can borderline AFK it though.
---
So its great for someone who can watch Youtube video 12 hours a day.
---
Streamers.
---
Well one #nosmeggingchance is the whining :)
---
You queue at the exact same time, then confirm between eachother which # BG you came into, then you accept/deny based of i you got into the same one
---
Do you know if this is confirmed anywhere?
---
The honor system give a sense of competition for pvp......
---
its 640 gold if you are PVP rank 3, you DO NOT need any training
---
IMO it is significantly better for the average player. It pushes the heavy grinders away from having to ruin other peoples' time in order to min-max. Now they can just mindlessly farm AV instead of mindlessly farming actual players who are trying to get to an instance, farm or level.
---
In my experience that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been too, now I don‚Äôt play :/
---
Yeah it seems like I should get used to the idea of signing up for raids.
---
The funny part is regardless of which goal, it basically doesn't matter.  Getting more Honor doesn't matter because you're only competing against your own faction (who are also getting more Honor).
---
Getting more Rep doesn't matter because AV is still the most honor efficient so you'll still be grinding it past Exalted
---
Do you know by chance where rumor comes from
---
Are you implying in horde? üòÆ
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll get right on that.
---
I try to slow the alliance zerg as much as i can with rank 1 frost bolts and frost nova, but most don't care and just keep running by me :(
---
I wonder how they'll approach WOTLK once we get up to that. I'd certainly like to see some changes to that expansion and beyond. Huge talents trees, no cross-server LFG, no skill-trimming, long levelling process, maybe tether flying mount usage to flight masters.
---
I  feel you mate, my druid tank has just dinged level 56. I plan now to just run BRD for a few levels, once I get to 58 its LBRS till 60, then UBRS.  
---
Questing seems very long. My plan is to go questing in WPL/EPL for gold once I am level 60.
---
Technically yes, but I don't see any advantage to that. Mindlessly running at each other spamming AOEs is not what we think of when someone says "pvp".
---
So you are wondering if you'll be able to MT something like Naxx that won't come in more than one year at the very very least while you didn't even passed lvl 10 first.
---
Also, whatever you pick, you'll be always be able to do 100% of the content (as a tank, if you can't main tank, you can offtank) even only by picking another spec (you still need dozen of dps in your raids). Min-maxing in wow make no sense, people clean raids in pug while wearing green and blues.
---
Even the worse meme spec (boomkin or palaretri) were above the required dps treshold in fucking naxx.
---
Pick the class you enjoy the most and roll with it.
---
Yeah OK well I actually don't have them, I have the off hand just not the main hand. I just wanted to get some sweet deeps in the raid team. I currently have Thrash blade &amp; Mirah's song. Is that enough? This Del rend main isn't dropping :)
---
Every bg ive run that had faerlina people was toxic af.
---
I wouldn't say easier. It was way easier on time though.
---
I so much see this happening :D
---
"You dont follow the crows?"
---
OK.. enjoy AFK kick :D
---
A warlock getting into a good position in AV could be a legit reason for summoning people from across the map.
---
You're the one that's bringing it forward. Why should the burden of proof be on anyone else?
---
25 people got paid.
---
Healers get an amazing off hand with I think +53 healing and 3 mp5
---
If you want changes, I have great news for you: there's a version of the game that they've been making changes to ever since Vanilla. Go play it.
---
The rest of us without those rose tinted glasses actually like the game as it was, and as it was on some private servers. If you never played Vanilla, and you never played a large "Blizz-like" private server, you have no room to talk. You're just trying to barge into our game that we wanted, and make changes that suit you, without realizing the people that got this game **are** the #nochanges group. So go away with your "quality of life" improvements and all.
---
No maybe about it.  That's why more pvpers play horde
---
Ended up going 1-7.  Horde defended and gave time for the northern push.
---
Well when AV was still being played the real way in TBC it kinda flies in the face of all the ‚Äúhardcore Vanilla‚Äù crowd who said the zerg started way back then. Maybe in the top bracket, but in the 51-60 bracket we never zerged, and it was always a fun match.
---
It always seems to be the people who complain about the ‚Äúlack of content‚Äù that burn through anything new in a couple of agonizing days, and then start complaining of having nothing to do again.
---
Explain? I feel like this is super funny, but I don't understand :(
---
Exactly the point I was making, the only Horde getting fucked are those doing WSG but WSG is so much slower than even Alliance doing it are at a disadvantage to their AV counterparts
---
I played one single AV, realized that this is exactly what was going on, and just played another game.
---
Seriously, if you want actual PVP play any other multiplayer game. WoW BG's are not for fun or for pvp, they are for honor grinding.
---
Without signups it's got to be pretty hellacious to try and form a raid, I'd think. I believe signups are pretty standard practice, as opposed to racial slurs and cat nasty. Give signups a shot :)
---
You sound like someone who needs to discover free action potions in order to play your class at a decent level. Also what class are you?
---
thats exactly why people complain because they like the game. if nobody gave a shit about the game nobody would complain. big brain huh?
---
They could always tweak the classes while they are in arena to bring balance to just the arena.
---
As a rogue, how good is Ghostshroud? Is Eye of Rend better? I assume I should be going for Mask of the Unforgiven above all else for pre-bis
---
Good to know ty
---
Always thought heirlooms should be green quality stat-wise.
---
&gt; This talk about stacking sunders is strictly limited to an arena style duel, which almost never happens in any Vanilla battleground. It sounds like you and I just have vastly different experience when it comes to PvP. For the record, I've had both Ashkandi and BRE on a blizzlike vanilla server, and generally found Ashkandi more reliable.
---
I'm a multi glad 2900xp + in both arena and RBGS for retail, yeah retail and classic are two very different games, but the concept how you prioritize stats, procs and abilities all come from different experience levels.
---
You should be watching your procs and you should generally be bursting when procs happen and/or when opportune moments come up. Locking out a healer to focus someone down, or if you have your BRE proc, crusader proc, enrage, etc. It's the same thing in PVP for retail, you line up your procs and you go for your burst because kills happen when the biggest spikes of damage is when all your procs are up. No one cares about consistent damage in pvp.
---
If you like Ashkandi use Ashkandi. It's not a bad weapon. BRE is just a flat out better weapon if you want burst windows of kills to happen.
---
The Untamed Blade (300 str proc) is another weapon that doesn't come up in many people's list, but it is definitely a high contender for one of the better pvp weapons. With weapon normalization, it isn't terrible and is another weapon where you can line up burst opportunities for kills.
---
Someone from a long time ago did their own comparison on the 3 weapons:
---
http://twinemperorz.proboards.com/thread/895/bonereaver-ashkandi
---
I would personally rate:
---
1) Dark Edge &gt;= Might of Menethil
---
BRE &gt; spinal (Bgs specifically) &gt; ashkandi &gt;= untamed
---
Spinal is unique because of it's on kill effective giving you rage as you kill. It's amazing in a BG setting, just get a random kill on a pet eliminates pet utility and burst of rage to continue battle. It's a Win-more weapon. But on small skirmishes it is worse.
---
I don't like asmon either but jeez man. Please seek for some education on gender dynamics and misogyny.
---
When you have 40+ people on a roster the last thing you want to do is waste everyone‚Äôs time trying to figure  out who is coming to raid and who isn‚Äôt because a dozen people have conflicts they didn‚Äôt tell you about, or because 45 people are available and you aren‚Äôt sure who to bring and who to sit.
---
Having sign ups just means they want to be organized and not waste your time.
---
On retail there‚Äôs actually a signup on the calendar in game. Tons of people require signups. It‚Äôs pretty good to know who is coming for raids so you don‚Äôt end up waiting an hour hoping people show up and then cancel or have to pug half the group last minute.
---
Cat form is the only advantage? Really? 
---
Level 30 is travel form..
---
Isn't cross realm bgs for your carebear servers only for other carebear servers?
---
Gear only speeds it up. Can be done naked with a ranged weapon.
---
I think if you give it a week, you will see it turn into that kind of a game. Most people are rushing AV rep so they can get the rewards and then go to WSG. Once that happens, the people that want to actually play AV will remain.
---
You mean fight club, or that other warrior discord?
---
Precisely. Pretty much everyone I knew had hit max exalted in AV prior to the 1.12 patch version. Long winded epic battles, with summons, etc etc was the norm.
---
When the zerg mode for it came out, it's popularity evaporated because everyone already had the rep. The honor wasn't as great then, and it just wasn't fun.
---
I personally want the rep now and am thankful the grind may be quick, but damn if it isn't boring PvE in something that should be PvP.
---
Yust curious why People are telling it when not true.
---
More power to him, he‚Äôs the 0.01% of streamers that financially benefit from playing WoW 8+ hours a day.
---
My server has atleast 1 obnoxious tryhard that does the same thing but will never make it.
---
I understand your reasoning and I somewhat agree. Personally I'd prefer the epic AV but I don't believe that will actually happen.
---
It encourages farming the opposition faction like cattle as opposed to engaging in PvP for organic reasons, or for pure enjoyment. It also promotes unhealthy play for those trying to rank. It‚Äôs no wonder it was one of the first systems totally abandoned and thrown in the trash with 2.0.
---
You are a Rogue.  
---
Thats illegal!
---
He got dungeon carries on his warrior too. I recall him doing react videos during that too.
---
Yeah, I played the hell out of battle grounds pre TBC and never remember once AV being what it is right now. Run to Drek and finish with 700 honor when Horde loses and still have 3k. This is stupid.
---
He's much smaller than I remember.  I thought the summonable bosses used to be Ragnarok sized?
---
Thanks dude. I'll have to look into it.
---
We‚Äôd still be running a pve race  in that version too. It‚Äôs all an efficiency game, and battling in the midfield or turtling to draw a game out just isn‚Äôt efficient, so most wont do it.
---
1st guild - Leader is the issue.  This is a bad guild.  You, and everyone else, were right to call him out and to leave the guild.
---
2nd guild - Individual is the issue, but guild leadership needs to do their job and either get him to stop, or gkick him.  Maybe not a great guild to be in.
---
3rd guild - You are the issue here (but I don't mean that in a negative way). A raid sign-up 24 hrs before isn't a 'hardcore' thing or such.  It's to help make sure you aren't wasting everyone's time.  It's is giving guild leadership the information they need to properly plan and prepare for the raid so that it is a smooth go.  It takes you 3 seconds to sign up, but helps them out immensely.  It also allows for a fair way of deciding who gets put in the raid and who has to sit out if &gt;40 people.  Just try to understand it from the guild leadership perspective.
---
Max range, drain and run. Cant kill you if he cant hit you.
---
Just stating facts
---
Lmfao the downvotes because I‚Äôm correct about adult children.
---
There is another post on the front page that shows the av rewards but the mount isn't on there what patch does it release with?
---
Both in vanilla and tbc we did incursions far back 
---
As a feral Druid I used to take over both mines then take the furthest back gy (inside the base) then quickly the two defending towers.  that if we keep it snowballed big time to a win.  You did everything to avoid the meat grinder in the middle.
---
I hate being susceptible to more fun
---
They want the rep and honor rewards
---
Thats what i'm afraid of. I have sometimes 2 hours to play. In a sunday 6 if i'm lucky, but most of the week 0.
---
Are the quests repeatable? And just so I understand - people just go to AV to afk farm for the duration of the match?
---
What has changed in that regard is the percentage. People who didn't want tier used to be a very small percentage, now a very large percentage are going off BIS lists that don't include tier or include very little of it.
---
Winning doesn't really matter for AV.  I often get more honor on the losing side.
---
Que? No entiendo
---
I understand and agree, I just dont have any faith in Blizzard to be able to make that happen. I mean they supposedly tried to make retail the best they could and look where it is.
---
I'd rather just have classic as it is now, and then for the next MMO blizzard makes they can start over.
---
Disable bag and bar addons, put Keys in keyring, enable again.
---
The reason there weren't enough to play is because 95% quit because they only twinked to smash non-twinks, regardless of what they claimed on forums before the change.
---
Thanks for the honesty, it seems signups are fairly common, which I can deal with.
---
Yup, this is exactly what happened to me as well. I went 
---
Also my laptop needs to have v sync enabled  and that went back to disabled after patch.
---
I have a feeling that dude has a good amount of impressive achievements from before his twitch/youtube fame. But fuck it right. Its easier to be another sheep jumping on the 'flavor of the month streamer hate' wagon.
---
my post from another thread
---
&gt;I cried about AV when they announced they were releasing the nerfed version. Now it's too late. I'll join the zerg till everyone is done with their rep grind, then maybe some of us will force a turtle and have a few moments of old AV
---
I‚Äôm level 52, have been stuck there for about 3 weeks. I‚Äôm seeing some stuff about how there‚Äôs actually good XP grinding in AV in some cave, which sounds awesome to me. I can grind xp, get honor and rep, all without being hassled by world PvP. Is this truly the case? When I enter AV at 52, am I the same bracket as the 60s? Thanks all!
---
Blizzard isn't able to do anything right, anything they do even if 90 % support it makes an ridiculous outcry in this subreddit
---
I think it was a couple of things.  There was a bug with people and mobs getting stuck at 1hp and being unable to die, but still able to attack.  There was a bug with people being able to trade cross realm in bgs.  I believe there was an issue with totem timers not working and totems lasting forever (someone correct me if I'm mistaken on that one).  There was also the ability to summon players across WSG with the flag to insta-cap....dunno if that's actually a bug or just something hilarious I've never seen before.
---
Mixing every server in the country AND not letting you bring anyone with you that isn't a random. What were they thinking.
---
It's about proving your worth is what it is. In every hardcore guild there are lines of people who would love to take your spot and be a raider in one of the top guilds of their server. It's the same thing with world buffs, we know we will clear just fine and probably take only 15 minutes longer if we don't get trib/sf but we all understand we signed up to be part of a min/max guild so this is what we asked for.
---
Thank you!   I'll try it out.  Baby woke, so I'll try it on his next nap.  I'm not sure why I didn't check their forums.  &gt;.&lt;
---
Found a warrior who wanted to co-op Bangalash when leveling through STV, ended up questing all the way to 60 together and he invited me to his guild who I've been raiding with for months now.
---
You missed the key words ‚Äúin game.‚Äù It won‚Äôt come out for another couple phases yet.
---
It's such obvious sarcasm I don't get how people can be so stupid to miss it
---
&gt; All this would do is push people to WSG.
---
At least WSG requires PvP, and strategy, and lets you queue with friends. This AV solo queue AFK PvE zerg shit is worse than any alternative.
---
matches are generally fast but it really only takes 1 or 2 people to totally f it up
---
2nd one i played yesterday went for about 30. ali lost
---
Yeah, just play casually. You‚Äôre not really gonna get to enjoy the endgame on the type of schedule we have.
---
Pitbull unit frames has a totem timer that can be affixed to the player frame.
---
Testing it now, seems to work:D thank you very much
---
Ha, I got into an AV with Asmon. It was the only one I won that night (as Horde).
---
They're gonna piss people off no matter what they do, so they might as well take the easy route and do nothing.
---
Thanks! That's what we kinda figured, but wanted to make sure there wasn't something we missed.
---
People still fell for that in 05? I remember people trolling each other like that in CS.
---
Are you talking about AV ques? Av isn't PvP
---
Everyone is their to get rep for the welfare epics
---
Oh so now you‚Äôve decided what‚Äôs in the spirit of Classic? Thank goodness, we were all waiting on your verdict here.
---
Is Don Julios released? I haven't seen it yet, and it was rumored that it wouldn't be until a later phase.
---
I've made a priest alt, and am considering if going tailoring/herbalism until 60, craft truefaith, then switching to alch is worth it? how strong is truefaith compared to dungeon drops or the T1 chest?
---
It's almost like the majority of people twinking wanted to do so for the feeling of power you get from absolutely destroying a normal character rather than actually competing on a level playing field
---
You are right rape and racism is so funny. Why wouldn‚Äôt everyone wanna be lead by a 13 year old edgelord?
---
The buffs that you and others are referring to would affect all faction NPCs in some vicinity, not just the general. Thus, we expect that the warmasters should be affected by the buff themselves if it were in the game‚Äîwe should see one extra aura on the warmaster while it is being killed, and we do not. 
---
I‚Äôve done my homework. There are dozens of readily available videos that you could find to contribute to the discussion if you felt inclined. It is much easier to say, ‚ÄúWell yes but *technically*!‚Äù than it is to actually advance the discussion, isn‚Äôt it? Unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt amount to satisfaction of your burden of production as the side bringing a complaint. Extraordinary claims made without a shred of evidence can be dismissed without a shred of evidence, and yet here I am, graciously providing evidence before dismissing your wild claims. Here is even more:
---
In patch 2.4, we saw 8 new spells created for this purpose ([example](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=45822/iceblood-warmaster)) when the precedent is not to abandon existing spells upon change, creating new spells. That fact alone causes reasonable suspicion that these auras did not exist in vanilla. Even if we accept the rather strange idea that blizzard would create 8 new spell IDs in 2008, it is even *more* outlandish that when increasing the strength of a ‚Äúpre-existing‚Äù set of auras, blizzard would *change the name* of said auras. Zero spells containing ‚Äúwarmaster‚Äù or ‚Äúmarshal‚Äù can be found in the spell database.
---
i assumed today. but some of the rewards are in another phase, the caster ring is phase 5 apparently
---
Definitely not.  The exalted grind being easier is an absolute godsend.  It was by far my least favorite part of vanilla and I dreaded doing it every time a new pserver would start up.
---
So the human monarchy also rules the whole alliance
---
I mean 1 of the 6 comments is "NO CHANGES"
---
You are correct but most people do not carry LIP potions. depending on your class you can do something about their LIP potion anyways  since it only lasts for 6ish seconds. 
---
Only thing would be warriors and I bet their fear goes through the LIP potion but I haven't tested it.
---
My only argument is why do we need to change the game? If I want a continually improved game I'll play BFA. I wanted to play classic to simply be able to play Vanilla.
---
It reminds me of retail. A PvE chore wrapped in a pvp cloak. The rewards are too good so it lures people into a min/max strategy and not pvping is the most consistent way to keep the rep flowing. It's an overall design flaw, far less the community
---
took me too long to figure out what your talking about. this 9 - 5 gold grind gives me a daily intellect debuff.
---
What are you talking about, original AV was a lot of fun, even if it was zergy. Desperately holding onto points and tug for wars that lasted hours or days, infinitely more fun than the silly 1.12 rush AV
---
Pretty sure they added exp to bgs in BC or late vanilla. Been a WHILE though so I may be wrong. I THINK I remember leveling an alt in BC and being able to get exp from BGs.
---
Never said that, but OK. Hope you have a fulfilling life.
---
I played like 4-5 hours last night and got a decent chunk into honored, so yes, its fast.
---
The strat for horde has literally become "kill belinda, and get as many HKs as possible before alliance zerg and win" I think I've won 1 in my last 30 games lol...
---
As if it requires any skill
---
They 100% should have added the 1.5 AV to classic for the rest of this phase and then move to the 1.12 in phase 3 or something similar.
---
But blizz doesn't give a shit about classic.  They just want to do whatever is the least work for them that keeps the sub numbers high.
---
So theoretical it's possible ?
---
You can misclick them. It happened to me the other day when I was panning my camera around. Or are you saying we have to unbind our interact buttons and keyboard turn our way out of the gates so you can have some chuckles?
---
I've also seen a mage place a portal in front of a soul well I was about to click on. So now I also have to manage cast bars for 40 people to make sure they're not placing one as I'm doing something.
---
It's a bad mechanic. You have a bad defense. It should be changed.
---
Then its just once a day!
---
You are acting like the hyperbole character you are trying to describe man.
---
no, now i am curious what triggers this question.
---
Why aren't the horde rushing to kill the end boss like the alliance?
---
Am rogue, I literally have every easily accessible key bound twice (using the shift key for second bind) along with all 8 buttons on my mouse. If you are only using 3 abilities you must be bad.
---
I do that for free for my guild. As long as you bring your own invis pot.
---
X does 2/4/6% more dmg
---
X costs 1/2/3/4/5% less mana

---
I grinded the mobs in the caves in blasted lands about 4 hours for each lvl. Then respecd fury prot and tanked dungeons trying to gear and finish up atunements and got my ubrs key.
---
It's griefing. You're intentionally fucking up someone else's game. Don't be a cunt.
---
My character lost 20k Honor after I read your comment.
---
Its too late now, people are already exalted.
---
LMAO
---
Because you vastly increase the odds that you're going to lose....stopping to kill them means you'll gain probably about 300-350 rep, while zerging the boss means you're much more likely to get 600+.
---
Am alliance, knew you clowns would just queue for BGs, most herbs I've had ever. Last night was bliss. Keep up the queue! Long or short what the Fuck ever just stay off the fucking boat.
---
Damn people been fake casting since TBC. This is news to some ?!
---
Yea...u can heal at 51..cant hit for 2 cents  vs lvls 60 though
---
Hello fellow warrior! I just dinged 56 on my Arms Warrior last night so we're pretty much on equal footing. I've pretty much exclusively grinded from 31+ with the occasional quest turn in (for stuff like Nifty, Carrot on a Stick, etc.). Currently I'm grinding level 52-53 mobs in Blasted Lands with a Brain Hacker, yielding around 25k XP/HR. That works out to be about 7-8 hours per level. To get from 56 to 60 requires 795,000 XP, so I should ding 60 in about 32 hours, give or take a few. 
---
I'm not grinding for pre-BiS or anything like that.. I just want to hit 60 first, then focus on other stuff. This gives me a very stable and predictable way to know how much longer it will take. Right now I'm at 8.5 days /played and have loved *most* of it. Levels 42-48 were a slog for me, even with the mount.
---
Apparently its level 60, so he won but couldn't equip.   Embellished for... reasons.    Sorry!
---
The good thing about classic to me is that we can, this time around, play it more efficiently (this time around with much less playing hours than i had b4 i can say the efficiency of waht i need to get done to raid properly is higher than when i had tons of hours to put in the game).
---
theres so much info out there and we already know wahts to come, that u can in theory not waste the little time we have to play just fucking around and not get anything in concrete done (ofc things that r rng is out of our control), im talking farming stuff, or spam a dungeon for a item we want, gettin sum bgs done for honor and rep, that kinda stuff.
---
when it comes to raids, coming aq20 and zg, those can b pugged easily as r mc and ony and to a certain extent bwl. im mostly sure that aq40 and naxx wont b that puggable for the majority of the players.
---
They don't care about classic.  It makes more sub money than retail but they just don't give a fuck because it keeps pointing out the fact that they ruined retail wow to them.
---
The exalted gear is nowhere near R13/R14 get.  You get an offhand for casters, a ring for melee/casters that are good and a dagger or 2h that are more in lines with MC item levels.
---
lol.
---
This post is so amusing when the other 30 posts are about how theres no PvP in AV.
---
this is literally how retail got fucked
---
Leveled a warrior 50-120, its just both teams ignoring eachother and pushing gys/towers then boss. If enough people die before their first gy caps then you get a turtle going. Still nothing how it used to be, people just want to rush it now.
---
Thanks, gonna go for it then
---
My point is your comparison makes no sense until they announce an impending release of TBC classic.
---
I'd argue they don't like Classic then. They just like the raiding part of it.
---
Im on pagle
---
Raid with my guild of no kidding adults who have lives and jobs. 
---
We have zero time for drama or flakes. 
---
Great balance and folks are able to give and take criticism with out melting down.   
---
Keep looking, they exists.
---
I think the BC system was worse. Ranking at high ranks is tedious, but it can be ignored.
---
In BC, conquest points were the easiest way to gear up, so it invalidated other parts of the game.
---
When R14 gear is the participation trophy that schools handed out to all the fat kids on sports day just for showing up.
---
Does R12+ get slightly easier as hardcore players get their R14 gear and stop grinding honor? If yes, how much easier and how long should I wait to start my grind?
---
What is dead may never die
---
Had this happen in MC a few nights ago -&gt; we needed to summon a few people, and a mage decided to cast a portal at the same time the warlock cast summon.
---
We then needed to summon more people.
---
We must have played different versions of vanilla, because there was definitely min maxing back then - people just weren't as good and the info wasn't as widely available
---
What a weird, non-sentence.
---
It doesn't - it's just someone being "cute".
---
We tried this with our 40 man  premade. I didn't work.
---
Druids are better herbalists since they can collect without breaking form,  so likely better for your herb/alch. There's no LW gear that's amazing for druids, and it's not a particularly profitable profession unless the devilsaur market on your server isn't already cashed.
---
Yea, but the dinner is a raw pototo you have to eat in a single bite, the desert is some damn good cake.
---
Don't be a salty spitoon, nothing is "fucked up" oh no you got a single 30 minute deserter buff, if it happens to you more than once, you deserve it.
---
It happened to me 15 years ago, I laughed, it's a game.
---
Then better join an AOE group.
---
√Ñhem, no.?
---
Yes, you should have left, OP. He told you.
---
1) you cant right click report inside a BG
---
2) if you do this a few times you'll get banned yourself for abusing the system.
---
Wow it's almost like that was a joke?
---
Herod is fine the queue is really only on raid night. Just remote login.
---
K
---
what did they remove?
---
*its the best version of AV and its funny how retail got it but classic didnt.
---
For Korrak's Revenge? These changes would very quickly kill the map as most players use it to level up alts.
---
He does too, I just meant for non-guildies. I still pay him though just because he's giving up gold to give items to me. He's a good dude
---
Yeah TBC. For a while in classic AV was not like this shitty pve fest
---
Most people wearing poop and be got t1 chest, shoulders and t2 helm
---
The comment I'm replying to is specifically referring to farming honor in AV for R14 weapons
---
Whitemane was a 2 hour queue trying to log in 6:20 pm Server time.
---
Prime raiding time though, I expect it to drop over the week. Essentially it didnt move for an hour and a half, then all of the sudden sped up as people (presumably) logged off after the raid.
---
‚ÄùCapping‚Äù

Simple question:

Can Paladins dispel (Cleanse) Onyxia's Fear in P3?
---
Could've sword my decursive was going off last raid for it, but I can't find any solid info.
---
Thank you!
---
Reminds of Dave Chappelle, you clicked on my pic statement in Sticks and Stones ü§£
---
Sometimes shit happens. It's not like you can't so other things in the meantime...
---
Blizzard already did that by making this the AV version. If this is the best honor, they fucked us over.
---
retribution*
---
People typically absorb the "solving" through "Google" now.
---
Also to note exercise increases energy levels. Sure you might be in pain and inflamed but who isnt in some way or another .
---
dbm is not working for me. someone told me to try bigwigs.
---
I am not saying your wrong but where your evidence to support this?
---
Most people would agree that the bigger time investment would make you better, also it's highly likely that the most committed players would have gone on the be the best arena players.
---
If I could find the list I wouldn't have asked this question now would I
---
You people are delusional. Seriously delusional
---
Just as a lvl 60 can't compete against a lvl 120.
---
Can all of you stop tryharding AV and WSG so much?  This tryhard attitude is burning me out.  You always got someone yelling in raid chat " RUSH BOSS", " WTF U DOING THERE" "CAPPING THAT PLACE IS POINTLESS"  
---
Please remember that this is a game and not everyone are in it for the rat race.  If you want the hardcore tryharding join a guild that will do it with you.
---
You see the edge, and then the mage channels another portal/teleport spell and cancels it before it ends.  You just see the edge of the portal and hear the summoning channel and people click out of habit.
---
Nobody cares about the PvP. Most people care about the gear and honor|rep/hour. Nobody wants games that are longer than neccessary.
---
he's an ass, and he told you he was an ass.
---
why did you stay?
---
Do you want changes or not?
---
No it‚Äôs not a magic fear. It‚Äôs like a warrior fear, only tremor or a pre fear ward.
---
LOL.. "I bind lots of keys"   
---
U only use like 3-4 stop acting like you are good.
---
Thats why I always loved wow. I don‚Äòt have to be the ‚Äûfastest‚Äú and ‚Äûbest‚Äú player like in some games like league of legends or dota. I can invest some time in it and still be at least a little bit successful
---
I've been trying to level my herbalism for a while now, but once I hit the 200s it became came difficult to advance while being corpse camped by warriors and such (holy priest BTW.) yesterday I easily got 300 with only one death to a warlock also herbing, I even managed to help a few alliance leveling by pulling mobs off them when they over pulled. The Light sees no factions, only other beings :)
---
Everlook is German server right? Any English speaking guilds there? Also what server time do people normally raid?
---
&gt;the no changes crew was against stupid stuff like revamping the talent trees
---
I've seen the no changes crew argue against basic mounting/dismounting QoLs because MaH SlIppEry sLOpe
---
When your kid is having a coughing fit at 1am, but you‚Äôre on the last boss.
---
I can speak from experience on private servers with the "old" AV on them that... This is more or less how it would go anyway. Maybe 10-12 minutes on average instead of 6-8, but still the same basic strategy.
---
It's not about the NPCs, it's how people are trying to max honor/hour.
---
Not to mention how back then people were probably getting 10fps if if they were lucky in the middle of the action, so it encouraged everybody with bad PCs to spread out and do the other activities.
---
I miss "the way it was" too, but I'm pretty sure this one is largely on the players changing their approach.
---
Every reward is released just get exalted
---
I just got into first one and the first thing I saw in chat was "We're not here to PvP, we're here to min/max honor."
---
WSG hast been 20 minute queues for Horde, at least in our battlegroup.  So yeah, it's a long time.
---
You're dumb op. He told you. You should have left.
---
is this for hunters at level 60? or can i do the mara solo at level 50?
---
Wow, what'd you do!?
---
we're averaging 8-11 min queues, 8-10 min 3-caps. about 1200 for 3cap, 600 for win, 400 for the 3 turn in, anywhere from 600-2k for kill honor
---
if the queues were instant it would be p damn good honor. obv not amazing compared to av but still not bad at all.
---
Imo making generalizations about the whole community based off a couple of comments is just as bad and equally as whiny.
---
While I like the idea, itd be a tough sell for people who have 15 years invested in characters. I think the amount of "fresh start" players would be *very* limited and might not be able to populate it. And transferring there would sort of break it as well.
---
Pretty sure I remember playing in an AV for 4-5 hours, going to bed, and logging back in to re-queue into the same fucking AV.
---
But you can get max honor and rep for about the same time. No reason to leave 2-3k honor sitting there every game.
---
Probably true, ty
---
I mean it sucked but it was a 15-20 min delay
---
Hey man, I can't convince you that the majority of twinks believed and practiced what they said on the forums. Its why they rarely went out of their way to lowbie zones to kill players, but would often try and attack higher level players.
---
does anyone actually know if Lei of the Livegiver is available with yesterdays update, or being released later?
---
Gameplay as intended.
---
Except most really really don't
---
I am not sure but I would like to as well. People continually shit on classic players but I'd love to look at the most committed players because we always say 'practice makes perfect etc.'
---
It was basic to very good players, but it didnt become baseline gameplay until arenas stepped up the competition.
---
Are you me?  I was up pretty late doing AV runs trying to max out reputation.  I can't sustain this shit, but I can't stop either.
---
Horde CANNOT win a zerg race, Alliance have mush easier access to the horde base, the alliance archers do a lot more damage going into the alliance base coming over the bridge. 
---
So horde get good rep killing Belinda and the tower LTs.  
---
And as pointed out, getting rep isnt a big issue, cos we'll all be exalted before the weekend is finished, even playing casually.
---
But it‚Äôs not about it being bad or not, it‚Äôs about it being better than AV and it doesn‚Äôt come close unfortunately.
---
i was just guessing. I can't think of another server that would have a similar reaction except maybe a horde from flamelash...?
---
Because they didn't wanted one side to leave immediately. If Alliance would have none twinks only game would end on their graveyard very fast.
---
I see it now lol. Love all your work. üñ§
---
I get where you are coming from. I have been in that shit plenty since I mainly been healer in the past.
---
I guess I just have the right mindset to know when it's my bad or not. They can whine best they want, if it ain't my fault I won't really care. But this is might be all up to how you are as a person.
---
What a heartwarming story, i love it! :3
---
I'm in a casual very friendly guild. We made tons of friendships and can't wait to get on coms so we can talk while doing quests, dungeons etc. Our raiding actually did better execution almost than the top server guilds and we realized that by being friendly and understanding we are strong and organized. We mainly achieved this by having an awesome GM and recruitement policy focusing on player personality. Most problems lie in the leadership. 
---
1 example we had only one case from a member being racist and he was kicked without warning.
---
Well so some People say high lvl content others say No but still gonna try need money anyway so was planning to pickpocket thousand of mobs. Maybe one of the boxes contains it Will let you know then.
---
Well I play with an EPGP system, so signing up and being on time makes part of getting gear. People are cool and we have a strong core.  
---
Which takes MC to farm status under 2 hours, and this week we made Ony splits. Beating ONY with 16 people was actually the best challenge I had in wow classic. This was only possible cause people sign up, and officers can organize the groups.   
---
Prio to this awesome Guild, I was in one that due to the amount of players I was raiding with the Alt group. Guess what, I could not even roll on BOEs which is way worse in terms of fairness and merit rewarding.
---
We get so much more rep and honor though
---
You're*
---
If they fix anything about this in the next days I'll be mad.
---
no more gnome mages abusing safespots in neutral cities
---
That's why I didn't mention the first guild, because that seems like a good reason to ditch.
---
Sounds like 2/3 of them were ok though, which seems about right compared to my server too.
---
This! üò≠
---
The vocabulary of this one is astonishing.
---
Does anyone really think once classic is done people will go back to retail? Most people I've played with quit around wrath and came back just for classic. Once classic runs it's course it's back to private servers / another game.
---
Literally trivial amounts compared to what you get with a win
---
I sold mine god damn
---
Yep, which of course many people have been stating would happen with this version if released but oh well. #NoChanges
---
I know #nochanges and all that, but I wish they could‚Äôve met halfway and come up with a hybrid system where you earn (and keep) honor at a similar rate to WSG/AB as you go without having to actually finish AV. And if you are there when it‚Äôs over you get a decent but not crazy amount of honor as a small bonus. That way you could have the old version of AV that goes for hours but it wouldn‚Äôt feel like you were punished by the game dragging on - you jump in, play as long as you can, then leave and you get whatever honor you get as if you had played one of the other BGs. 
---
I‚Äôm sure someone somewhere would still find a way to break it through some min/max bullshit algorithm that completely goes against the spirit of the game, but it‚Äôd still be better than this.
---
You can rank up higher than just one rank, I don't have specifics, but many people were rank 4 after the first week honor was released. There is a theoretical limit, I just am not sure what it is. Someone made a good post showing all the math on this a couple of weeks back.
---
Without no changes you wouldnt have Classic to complain about, nor classicwow reddit to write your complaints.
---
If you dont like it unsub, we wont miss you. Thanks.
---
I see, so we Googled "how to play WoW," and it said "farm it to death and then salt the earth."
---
Shadowcraft tunic is trash, but that raid leader is even more trash for that scummy move.
---
Dont ever run with that guild again, and put them on blast in your servers LFG chat.
---
Sounds like your salty you don‚Äôt have the time to do it. I don‚Äôt either, but I don‚Äôt want to take it away from people who do.
---
15 years ago it was fun when you had 15h to play, when you only have short intervals to play, enough to do 1 or 2 BG's it kinda sucks.
---
And yet you knew what word they were using, so it doesn't matter
---
*Wants to avoid pvp while leveling*
---
*queues up for BG to level grind*
---
This is 300 IQ
---
In all seriousness, i was stuck in your shoes as I was 52 when phase 2 hit.  If wpvp doesn‚Äôt calm down on your server I‚Äôd suggest dungeon grinding. Make sure to get all quests for the dungeons. As a priest, I spent a lot of time in BRD 52-60. To answer the questions you had, AV is 51-60 bracket and I‚Äôm not sure about cave xp grinding. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt help you there.
---
I tried to play a little retail while classic down.
---
OOF, shit tier game, literally garbage in all aspects
---
We do not get 450-500 rep on zerg losses...I've been monitoring it and it's 300-350 typically.  If we get above 400, it's only because Alliance is slow that zerg.
---
Not in classic
---
I have a rare disease that when people whine it makes me lose brain cells. I‚Äôm not doing so good! :(
---
Which won‚Äôt accurately detect that the player has stopped casting if they use a macro rather than moving. You should learn your own tools :)
---
Thanks a ton!
---
I'm gonna bank on incompetence.
---
At 52, you can also start poking your nose into BRD, and getting to the entrance should be somewhat easier now that people have battlegrounds to get honor points :)
---
You can't group and que. You all have to solo que at the same time.
---
I play PVE tho....     :/
---
I kinda doubt classic has more subs than retail. Like I doubt they more than doubled subs for classic.
---
Oh sorry misread, I take back my assumption that you are a cunt. Feel bad now
---
Maybe stop rushing Drek and we can actually have a real game?
---
Clearly you only enjoy the game because you were 6 when you played it in 2005 and you're still seeing everything through rose tinted goggles
---
I could've addressed the point better without the sarcasm, true. I did so. Here's a less-bitchy comment of mine to explain my position better. But man it's fucking hard not to reee myself when all I see is complaining on this sub and it's always upvoted straight to the top of the comments or the sub itself. It's just shitty social media fatigue I guess. Like, I honest to god think that the infamous "You think you do..." quote is right. All this sub does is cry about the game. It's like the people here are masochists who play this game they hate and everyone agrees and up votes their shitty complaints. 
---
"My point is this community has, since day one, cried about everything. Lately this entire subreddit is *HORDE BAD* while in late August it was *STREAMER BAD*. Before that it was *RELEASE DATE TOO LATE, NOT TRUE CLASSIC SUMMER BAD*. There's also *GANKING BAD* and we can't forget *NO KEYRING BAD* and *DM CAME TOO QUICK BAD*. I think within a week it'll be *AV BAD* just on the trend I'm seeing and if you look at the front page now you'll probably see the beginnings of this week's new hate-train for the game.
---
Basically this community will never not whine about something. 
---
That's the point I was trying to make. I come here for hilarious shit, thoughtful discussion of the game I love and occasional memes and constructive feedback for Blizzard. I don't want to come here and see a bunch of grown ass adults crying because a streamer who has literally no impact on their game doesn't play the right way (which is ironic considering the greatest strength of Classic is the ability to play how you want)."
---
I have a rare disease that when people whine it makes me lose brain cells. I‚Äôm not doing so good!
---
Ok.
---
I reckon more people would do that if they weren't getting kicked from a  pvp game mode for trying to pvp.  
---
legit, people are getting kicked for trying to diverge from the zerg strat.  this community is weird.
---
...what?
---
Druid was ridiculously overrepresented in the 2v2 bracket, and 3v3 was utterly dominated by RMP
---
1.5 isn‚Äôt a multi day AV battle. It‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt even know the different version of AV but feel like the edgy kid going against the complaints.
---
They can be taken out with a small group so easily its infuriating that they skip them Everytime.
---
Absolutely fucking meaningless
---
Great, we can clear MC in 1hr 2 rather than 1hr 3
---
So it turns out that spell penetration is not a stat we're going to have until AQ (speculation still), which means the caster version of the AV exalted ring is not yet available.
---
People from all servers are mixed together...
---
I didn't have 15h to play back then. I had 2 hours a day, my brother had 2 hours a day, and that was it.
---
Yes. That is what I got the first time I was with them. But subsequent times, I just got immediately kicked out right after the gates open. It was extremely tilting.
---
No DR in BGs but your point mostly stands
---
Stop being a sheep using same copypasta comment like other people, why blame nochanges if there were like 100 changes, and most damaging of it is server size. I dont remember that kind of AVs while playing nost. It either 100% nochanges, or 100 changes to all things
---
Stand by the mailbox at any major city and yell "PORTALS 1G" you will make a lot of portals
---
Do I get double honor for turning in AV marks on the appropriate weekend, or is the bonus honor just applied for honor you get during the BG?
---
Twinks enjoyed the feeling of "perfecting" a character and getting off the gear upgrade treadmill for all time. Grind out the STV arena chest pickups or win the STV fishing tournament after countless deaths as a lvl 19, and the AGM or lucky fishing hat was yours **forever** and relevant **forever**, for example. Twinks then really enjoyed competing against other twinks because levellers in white were no challenge. For those who want to destroy people, why go to the trouble of twinking? Just gank levellers in Ashenvale or STV. Twinking a toon can be really time- and money-consuming and that investment was almost totally done to compete against other twinks. 
---
Having said that, if you believe that twinks were all malicious, petty and mean-spirited and that's a **belief**, I don't think I can convince you otherwise? Or why not roll a 19 priest twink with gravestone scepter and see for yourself what its like?
---
I mean a 30 minute battle would be nice. 10 AVs all horde losses in 5-10 minutes.
---
OP never played on a private server
---
Salty over gear in a 15 year old game?  Get a reality check, I'm a casual player and I'm perfectly fine with that.  I'm not even eligible to play AV yet because I've got shit to do
---
It's this weird thing of motivation that happens in rpgs. At first you play for fun, but then you get addicted to the game loop. As you reach the end of the game, the rewards from the game loop are much more spaced out. To chase that high, you have to optimize your play time.
---
My guild leader first recruited me with the allure of getting the eye because of my name and for that I'm forever grateful to him and all the boys at &lt;Takeover&gt;.
---
Why are you actively contributing to your own mental decline then, regarding your previous comments?
---
Seems unneccessarily masochistic.
---
Can you only see it on the vendor if you have rep? Is it in org or at the instance in Tauren mill? I ask because I went to look on my little 54 mage and didn‚Äôt see much at TM.
---
I don't necessarily mind if they do that providing they improve the game
---
The login server was destroyed for like 15 minutes though after the servers were down for 15 mins.
---
Yup! Just hide behind something and blizzard, 9 times out of 10 they don't know where you even are.
---
Can you all stop being useless in AV and WSG so much? This carebare attitude is annoying as fuck. You always get somebody being useless and draging everyone else down for no reason.
---
Please remember this is s game and not everyone is in it to fuck around. If you want the casual fucking around join a guild that will do it with you.
---
&gt; 1) you cant right click report inside a BG
---
You can.
---
&gt; 2) if you do this a few times you'll get banned yourself for abusing the system.
---
There's a clip of Staysafe abusing this to get some1 kicked floating around and I doubt he's getting banned.
---
You said 
---
&gt;people even need garbage just for the fewest of silvers because there are no consequences.
---
That's an accurate statement. As is 
---
&gt;Who do you propose is going to enforce this?
---
If your solution to people needing vendor trash in AV is to start needing BoP blues/epics in dungeons and raids, you are the one creating a strawman. You know those two things are not the same, yet because you lost the opportunity to vendor a 4g item by greeding, you now want to lash out a people actually on your server which will hold you accountable.
---
find peace and solace in your hobby and passion. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
---
Is BRE better for warriors than unstoppable force?
---
it lead to the largest ever increase in subs in wows history actually. They don't release exact numbers but they claimed that they got more new subs they they had ever had. They didn't break out returning subs or anything else, just raw new subs.
---
Now would that number be higher then retail? Not sure but it must have been a really big number.
---
We all must pay for the sins of our fathers (or xrealm counterparts)
---
What's the most OP class for AV in retail?
---
Below avg iq = not that bright. Not the avg of 10 people downvoting a blatantly obvious sarcastic comment ;)
---
Mr. Brightside
---
what format would you accept?
---
Nah basically the same. It's the dffierences in honor
---
hahaha man, awesome musical! but now I have the song stuck in my head
---
you get more rep for quick wins though. A win is roughly 500 rep with hand in.
---
Not sure how good the xp or anything is, but it just takes 5 people to report you to get kicked from the BG. If you run out of the group into a random cave, I would expect people to try and kick you some of the time, if people are turtling you should be relatively safe to do it, but you might find yourself with the deserter debuff more than you would like. I dont think this should be a feature of AV, but that's just how it is.
---
&gt;People who didn't "solve it" back then and haven't played on private servers haven't absorbed the "solving" through osmosis.
---
If you don't think you can solve something via research into readily available and widely used materials I dunno what to tell you.  
---
If I need to know X, Y, and Z to complete a task and solve a puzzle I'm not required to have done it in the past to know what the requirements are.  If I look up a website and read the requirements and follow the steps to achieve the optimal results it works out exactly the same.  I've solved the puzzle by following the steps via research.
---
If research tells me I need to farm AV rep for my best epic items, and it also tells me that the best way to farm this rep is to zerg the boss, and I then zerg the boss, I've solved AV via research even if it's my first time ever doing the BG.
---
Is scouts medallion available for purchase with the most recent patch? If so, what is required to purchase the lvl 38 version? (Rep, gold, Marks, etc)
---
Summoning portals are disabled in AV.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs disappointing at the moment but once all PvE only players who are after the Rep are gone it may get better with more alliance focused on honor as well!
---
I wasn't sure you were trolling before I wrote my other response. I'm sure now.
---
That sort of coordination isn't going to happen in AV pugs.
---
Giant death ball is as complex as you can get.
---
Alchemy is mega useless btw. You should only really do it if you think its cool or something.
---
The dungeon run is your job, the gear is whatever you see fit to improve your QoL after you get paid.
---
Playing on a PvP server is toxic. I picked Atiesh for my alt and everyone is super nice, currently have a level 30 there.
---
I ran farm log and was getting 530+ rep on loses
---
BRE is arguably one of the best PvP weapons in the entire game, even through Naxx. The armor pen proc is insane. It is substantially better than Unstoppable Force.
---
Huh, thought I remembered it being 30, cool even less now.
---
Yes, fewer wins means fewer marks, fewer marks means less experience.
---
What was the question? Because that matters
---
I have read in multiple places that the mount and healing offhand are not. Are you melee? If you‚Äôre not one of the caster classes then don rodrigos won‚Äôt show for you at vendor
---
[https://youtu.be/McCwTT-0Eiw](https://youtu.be/McCwTT-0Eiw)
---
Good way to make me quit, the basic UI is cancer.
---
Someone call rathamus, he has a few words to say about alliance winning AV with his 600+ AV win streak strat.
---
HorDE ArE MinDleSS MaNiaCs Who jUsT WanT TO grIef   
---
No, We just want honor, you can clearly see that.
---
My experience was r14 != Gladiator skill level necessarily but generally r14 players were much better at PvP than the average player since they did it so much, a lot of r14s from vanilla ended up as gladiators in tbc
---
He's showing the last page, since there's no rodrigo's and other offhands. Not sure if the mount is available yet tho.
---
By rough estimate, 70g per hour or more. More than half from herbalism.
---
You must be a troll, bud. Attitudes this toxic are just caricatures at this point.
---
Clearly not all changes were bad, IMO no changes has been really bad for this game.
---
Where the fuck is Smite
---
Just want to check, was the mount available and how much is it?
---
People keep saying 10g and I keep trying to explain that's not the case.
---
thats exactly what it is.
---
&gt; Note: Yes, I posted this on Reddit and not the BNet forums because I still haven't made it past level 10 because I keep re-rolling 
---
LOL
---
As an Alliance Priest I would love it if all my AV games were 7 minute losses with 3x the Honor while all the other Alliance got their 7 minute wins for rep.
---
But I just follow the zerg otherwise I'd have no one around to heal.
---
You do realize you're complaining too...right?
---
Bloodlust at the gate
---
Nah it was post wrath or late wrath.
---
They do? I played one wsg last night and the moment we had 2/0 and they third flag was in our possession, the call went out to hold, not cap.
---
I mean, it would be nice if the average game didn‚Äôt last like 6-7min.
---
Never have I ever seen something that more accurately describes me as a human
---
1:00am - man my resume really needs some work I could probably get a better job, but my guild needs me for ..... moral support. Cuz im not 60 yet.
---
Hi, /u/Blazineagles77
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e98jkh/when_is_av_weekend/). 
---
People seem to forget that there was no ‚Äúclassic‚Äù.  It was a constantly changing game.
---
I thought it was details or honorspy.
---
It isn't fun. But it is fun to sheep a twink as an untwinked person, to overcome odds and fearbomb a twinked rogue about to nuke your fc, to mc someone down from the gy - all the more fun because they're twinked to the gills and you're someone in whites and levelling greens. I could imagine them raging and that was bliss. When they targeted me from across the field to kill me specifically, that meant I had gotten under their skin, despite the hundreds of gold they had invested in the toon.
---
I honestly think 51-60 AV in TBC is what most people are dreaming of. It was the first experience a ton of people had with it considering how many people joined the game in that time.
---
yeah ok, like I said I am not sure how it was. Well it is what it is, atleast you can queue ws together :)
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs challenging you.
---
Just make a far-forward cap (aka not adjacent to the current front line) take longer to cap, and don't open up Drek/Vann until X Towers are down or until the adjacent Tower is down.
---
Many people might be pushing it. That's what, .1 or maybe 1% of the players because ofnthe brackets?
---
Class?
---
Agreed, people who play 19 twinks always play the most OP classes for that bracket as well, then stomp non twinks an act pro because they dropped 1k gold on a level 19 character
---
only change i want is fear breaking after certain amount of damage. that makes me so salty lol. Yesterday I had a lock fear me, drain life.  A priest comes and mind flays me and mind blast, mean while I am running like a chick with its head cut off in the lava dying by 600+ fire tick every second and im still feared.
---
It takes less than a day /played to gear out a 19 twink. A level 60 with the same power level advantage compared to fresh 60s could take a month or more /played which isnt attainable to most of the community especially with continuing power creep as patches come out. 
---
Twinking can be a lot of fun and has a  definitive attainable endpoint.
---
The very same twitch stream that revealed the ring isn't there yet DID show the Lei of the Lifegiver.
---
The reporting is that the only thing missing is the band.
---
Gquit in the middle of the night
---
But who's in the cannon?
---
What were the other, better implementations, historically?
---
No toxic undeads, good trio bro, give them a hug!
---
Can a feral druid use frost oil or weight or sharpening stones?
---
Maybe, but the state of 1.12 AV was made clear when Blizzard announced it. They just didnt listen of course.
---
i fucking hate min maxing. i'm a GM too so trying to find a happy medium between min maxing and letting people roll on upgrades cause their upgrades sucks. I'm from a simpler time!
---
Havent seen anyone mention that you cant even queue with a party, nothing like a solo pve experience in this mmorpg pvp based game...isnt that also a customchange???
---
Again, was the streamer playing a melee class?
---
lol I argued this over a year ago and got downvoted to hell on this sub and never came back. So happy to see I was right.
---
What? I‚Äôm excited!
---
I'm on bigglesworth and go out of my way to kill fisherman but only if they are under level 48.
---
There is literally someone being helpful in general chat in the screenshot though.   Maybe i'm missing something...
---
I mean they still can if they want to be dicks but they're shooting themselves in the foot if they're actually trying to Honor grind
---
Yes. After you buy the mount you can use it forever even if you De-Rank.
---
You can even buy 2 different mounts when you hit Rank 11, bank one, (in case you didn't have the riding skill for it yet) and use it later even if you derank.
---
All my comments apply to Vanilla PRIOR to the riding changes they made at the end of Vanilla in preparation for TBC.
---
\-Rank 11 in Vanilla
---
It wasn't fun because the population of twinks per battlegroup was too small to get games even after hours in queue.
---
in a straight zerg race, alliance will win 100% of times unless they are incompetent. They have an easier run into hordes base, horde archers are poorly positioned compared to the alliance archers as they cross the bridge. 
---
So Horde can slow down and kill Belinda and the LTs for more honor and rep, or they turtle and defend stopping the alliance zerg. thats how Horde win. 
---
In a straight race, horde lose every time.
---
&gt; Don't be a salty spitoon, nothing is "fucked up" oh no you got a single 30 minute deserter buff
---
If I only have 2 hours to play a day you're definitely fucking up my time. Don't be a twat.
---
The Horde cam to tell you about Green Jesus
---
Pretty sure you can queue up as 5 man party?
---
Damn. We've had like 2 perd and 3-4 core hounds. Also 2 pair of the gloves.
---
This is why I love working from home. I'll stay up till 5am if I damn well want to.
---
They want us to have the classic experience!
---
yeah, they are pretty funny, mr white knight.
---
Hmm Kang comes to mind for a BOE that is worth to pick up if you want to stick with 2h axes. Although I am still using my WW axe at 53, lolz.
---
Don Rodrigo's band wasn't added until later in Vanilla.
---
You could just not look up anything or use add-ons
---
That's all I want honestly. I just want my 3 piece pvp set bonus.
---
No you cant.
---
I feel like most people didn't realize how bad some things would actually be and just wanted the parrot the popular thing, which happened to be #nochanges
---
And here we are.
---
Buy some good boots on AH ASAP and enchant then with running speed and use them
---
I never played pservers, but the players I have met that were pserver players are awesome. Super nice and helpful.
---
&gt;gettin the rep has also nothing to do with wins because if u only loose, the rep grind is just that fast.
---
Losing the zerg gets you 300-400 rep....winning the zerg gets you 500+.
---
Thanks for the honesty. 
---
That's how I feel most people who don't want this feature felt. They just didn't want Blizzard to get more money out of spite.
---
May I ask you this though? Would you be ok if this feature was added for free? Say 1 free character appearance change a year?
---
Anyways, if classic continues to grow, don't you think they will eventually have to add a paid service like this or charge more for the subscription since they aren't getting revenue from expansion releases?
---
There isn't but it's better to get through 4-5 games an hour for the bonus even if you lose half of them than it is to fight each other and split the honour for killing people with up to 10 people.
---
i had this dude argue with me about letting the horde win in wsg because honor per hour it would make more sense.. like is this what is has come to?  Fuck the horde no free wins, i am playing to have fun.  Dude was already messing up not playing with premades, if he really cares about his ranking he woldnt be playing solo BGs..and you'd have to be on 24/7 just to compete with people that do this for a living. streamers ruined bgs..people just want to focus on honor instead of fun.
---
This is a bad comment
---
Unfortunately a lot of the tier gear is poorly itemized until T3.
---
Thanks for reading till the end I guess. :)
---
nop
---
What rewards won't come out? Don Julio's is there, why would you assume the other ring isn't?
---
&gt;People need to understand this, wow is an investment game. You get all the best stuff by investing the most time and dedication.
---
To be fair, this also applies to like.. everything in life. It's not specific to WoW.
---
^ This.
---
Sure, I'd love a barbershop
---
And sure, I think it's stupid that higher PvP ranks have so much decay that it takes 20+ hours a week just to break even and start making any progress at all and I'd appreciate a change to make it less batshit insane
---
But ultimately I got the game I wanted and I'm happy with the vanilla mechanics as they are.
---
If I'm displeased by anything, it's all the ways it's *not* accurate to vanilla, like the reduced NPC/Player draw distance, the assbackwards implementation of batching, the artificial looting/selling delay, and the fact that *sharding still exists for no fucking justifiable reason* (and no, the fact that the shards are zone-wide instead of 40-yards-wide doesn't make it acceptable)
---
Neither was this version of AV
---
#nochange is cancer
---
which one isnt available
---
Even if it was like a month ago?
---
I did lots of quests in AV yesterday. Never got reported. Only people asking at spawn get reported really.
---
ill trade that honor for the rep you gain for having 98%winrate
---
You do not know this fact at all.  Numbers are not released by Blizzard
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
AV 1.12 was warned about way before release. Min-maxing in Classic was sure to happen, the games been out for 10,000 years.
---
I mean, it's competitive in that you need to play 18 hours a day and/or account-share.
---
&gt;It encourages farming the opposition faction like cattle as opposed to engaging in PvP for organic reasons
---
Sure, *before* bgs, but you get like 2k honor from a wsg win, no amount of world pvp even remotely compares to that.
---
As a super casual player I totally understand hating on the no lifers, but people who live and breathe WoW tend to be pretty good at WoW.
---
Yeah it's more about how many 5 minute games vs 50 minute games you get.
---
Yeah, I had a mage who joined our dungeon group, get pissy that we weren't 4 mages and a healer, and left
---
Nah. Your nostalgia is getting the best of you.  Pservers were dogshit.
---
My spirit is pretty much depleted too.....
---
I just did a 40 min AV on my first run through and had an absolute blast with it, ALOT of people left tho and alot of whiners "let horde win", this isn't optimal honor/rep and basically gave up playing  to give the horde the win.
---
The stat changes made it so that most sets went from being absolute garbage to actually useful.
---
Things like Don Rodrigo's band are held off on because it would be BIS for all casters and it's so easily obtainable.
---
same boat as you i guess. money is not a problem anymore, got everything i want with a bunch of free time and was super bored of every day being the same. i always liked music but had no time to learn an instrument so i decided to put 10% of my WoW time into learning guitar every day. helped a lot
---
Since the horde team will be ~90% max level for the tier, I hope the ones who fell for this are the low level alliance who insist on "helping" in BG's.
---
I'm with you on this completely. Knew a guy who would walk in the house and sit down to play, his wife brought him food, he didnt do anything (including take care of his own daughter), would get 4-5 hours of sleep and rush to work at the last second. Then he'd repeat it all.
---
He didnt play enough to get grand marshal.
---
Feral is pretty versatile. Tank/dps in dungeons. Off tank/dps in raids and occasionally provide healing/decurse support if you're carrying an intellect set.
---
Jokerd still got viewers? Dafuq

Working as intended.

If you target is fanous enough and you dont need to stream snipe.

Done, you just got his location, ready to rumble.

I'm not saying I like everything in Retail either, but that is a problem with any product aimed to appeal to the masses.
---
Holy shit, that's a really good analogy for the wealthy class.
---
Retail is waiting.
---
Yea. You‚Äôve never seen this jackasses videos I‚Äôm guessing. His incredibly cringey die hard crowd would just listen to him talk for two months straight while throwing money at him. I‚Äôm not even joking here. Just throwing wads of cash at him during his streams for doing fuck all.
---
Everything is possible except UBRS beyond Rend. Strat/Scholo/UBRS/DMN will require good gear.
---
&gt;We had the extremely fun and important role of keeping melee from killing ranged/healers. Anything that over extended was a target, and once those targets were down, their frontline was soft as fuck, allowing us to gain ground.
---
I mean, this was my actual point.  As melee, if you're playing *correctly* then you're literally just standing back and watching.  You pretty much only get something to when the melee on the *other* side was stupid
---
You can 4 man every instance but UBRS, if you are all good players, know your class well, and communicate / work well as a team.  No reason why you cant do LBRS/Scholo/Strath as well played 4 man. Will just take longer.
---
&gt; when an epic BoE drops and the group leader states ALL NEED in chat
---
nope, that's ninja.
---
the standard loot rules are to greed unless you actually need to use it.
---
righteous orb drops and the group leader states RESERVED in chat?  Nope.
---
If only that were the case man. There's definitely a correlation between the two, but I wouldn't say that all 2004 R14 players were "really good".
---
I think the biggest problem is that you can‚Äôt burn through the RL grind in a few hours or days and be done with that goal. Practically everything we do requires long term focus and commitment, but a lot of us are not able to do that mentally. You get hyper focus on this goal for hours or days or maybe a couple weeks if we nothing else to distract us. Then we never do that thing ever again. That doesn‚Äôt work for jobs, school, etc.
---
Yuck, so many turtlers in this thread, so many people prolonging games.

Melee was actually really fun in old av. You just need to pick your battles, preferably have an epic mount, and look for the skirmishes outside the larger battle. It was a ton of fun.

I never did one quest after 52 farmed bis 60 took me till 60 to get hand of justice so

&gt; Things like Don Rodrigo's band are held off on because it would be BIS for all casters and it's so easily obtainable.
---
LOL NO, you're just making shit up now. It's a downgrade in most cases, it was only added later becasue spell penetration was added later. its the only non-raid spell penetration in the game. If anythin the melee version is the clear BiS ring.
---
Honestly it looks a poster for theater/Broadway. "Come see Van cleef this holiday season, its fun for the whole family!"
---
I mean this is what I don't get:
---
&gt; I can play wsg with friends. I can go play alts. I can go play other games until theres more stuff to do.
---
You can do that now. I can't play AV now because it's full of honor/rep spammers.
---
Why subject yourself to a 12 hour grind, which I assume is really quite boring. You just ride past each other and hit some weak NPCs.
---
Don Julios? It gives you 1% crit chance and 5 stamina over the Blackstone Ring.
---
I don't know. I just don't get why you play WoW and engage in these intensely dull grinds when there is actual content in WoW. Not only that, but this playstyle is also actively removing content, ie: AV does not exist as a BG right now, it's just an honor/rep farm.
---
There's more pvp than that inside Ironforge.
---
48 hours? Maybe not. But I did enjoy the occasional 8+ hour game. Starting a fresh AV, leaving for class, coming back and it still being the same AV. That was awesome! 
---
Actually summoning the huge guy! The Mines actually being worth it!
---
rofl what? the vanilla AV strat was to kill galv, then rush FWRH and cap that and defend the two FW towers until they capped then kill drek with whatever adds were up. games where people were farming in the middle of the map and summoning ivus and shit were dumb and people hated them just as much back then.
---
I'm currently using RangeDisplay, it adds a box to your screen showing you the distance between your character and the currently selected target
---
2 or 3 runs in ZF are always worth it.
---
That‚Äôs the same thing just with more steps.
---
ye, the win gives more rep i agree but i wanted to say is when it comes to av, even if u only lose, the rep grind is fast.probb the fastest rep grind out there.
---
Rep turn ins after you stop alliance Zerg and loot their corpses
---
I'd say they're "really good" compared to the average player.
---
WoW is not an esport for the majority of players. 
---
It's an RPG. I much prefer the time &gt; skill approach.
---
Now I understand why there are so many defias.  Those pants are tight!
---
I'd wager not quite to the extent that a mage can.
---
Because he got more than me WHAAAA!
---
Yea this will unfortunately only work if the person counterspelling/bashing/kicking/whatever doesn't have a castbar addon.
---
Sure maybe in the heat of battle they might not notice it, but most of the time it's not going to work if they have that addon.
---
I wouldn't wanna talk to you if you abandon me honestly
---
Literally unplayable.
---
yes totally. even getting 10+ players to defend and stop the zerg makes a hell of a difference. 10 players with some healers, means horde can defend their base from the zerg. Alliance who die, spawn way back at Stonehearth GY, and maybe even further back at Stormpike if Horde Cap Stonehearth. 
---
But with horde ressing in their base, and can immediately join the fight again, 10 defenders can turn the game into a turtle, where the forces are forced to fight.
---

Spellpen items come later maybe?
---
Horde PvP eastern - 3-4 min AVs and 15-20min WSGs
---
I think a lot of people originally made a ton of alts and stupid mistakes with their chars and assumed that just focusing on one char for a couple hours a day was going to be enough because that's what they failed to do in vanilla. What they don't realize is that it took that plus 5 hours a day of playing to achieve what the peaked out players did. (Not including pvp which was more like 18 hours per day).
---
Imagine being a caster and complaining about Classic not being fair.
---
\- Every warrior ever.
---
What can I say? I'm rotten.
---
Cause he's an idiot.
---
The vendor has multiple pages. The items are just on the other page.
---
This trash tier subreddit upvotes anything and got an erection reading his comment cause they hate the idea of people minmaxing in an MMO. The thought that people were getting exalted for the loot to not be there was such a great thought they didn't even hesitate to fact check.
---
I guess I didn't expect that to be the case because the games I play generally aren't like this.
---
It strikes me as weird that people want to spend 12 hours running past each other in a PvP environment. Actively not engaging in the content but avoiding it. I know that makes it the fastest honor per hour or whatever but why is there this constant need to be doing everything in the most efficient way. 
---
I play a lot of games, but I guess not the MMO type any more. Most the multiplayer games I play are pure multiplayer, player against player type thing. So this type of play doesn't exist.
---
Not really. The last few weeks I was making 2k/week with very casual pvp (a few hrs per week). It‚Äôs 10-20 kills in the world. People overestimate how efficient bg honor actually is, specially when you factor everything in
---
I was absolutely exaggerating that sentence, I just meant that theres quite a steeper learning curve
---
I want to know this too
---
It‚Äôs also the shit honor system.
---
~2 minutes
---
Stop. Posting.
---
The mount is in the game. The only Phase 5 item is Rodrigo's which is in the game (as are 1.11 pvp weapons).
---
I had a couple friends in vanilla that broke upon getting Rank 13, one in particular was a week or two from getting GM but then we got a top Guild transfer and they were bloodthirsty for our instant queues.  I think he gave up and pretty much quit the game
---
Right now, in the BGs, people are farming the rep for the items.  Don't care about honor right now.
---
Don't think I'll get it quite as fast as some people have already :P
---
Maybe in a week or two.
---
Buddy. I‚Äôm in the same boat basically to the letter. Because of our shared circumstance, I love you - stop by the inn at the CR on westfall and have an ale some time. All the best and here‚Äôs to hoping for better days ahead.

They are part of the same race as Kil Jaedan and Archimonde, they just resisted Sargeras' corruption and left their planet. They are part of the lore.
---
You get in troublesome quests that require you to group up with people, you talk about stuff meanwhile, having fun slowly going through a cave with careful pulls. Leveling is content by itself. I leveled to 60 and had no intentions going into raids or endgame pvp. Made a new character and having fun once more. That's just my perspective and you should ask yourself whether you're having fun or not. Maybe it is worth it just to level 60.
---
People's want for Classic was because it is by far better than retail.
---
Play with the group or don't play... they made your choice easy.
---
Dont mention it; we keeping it on the low bro.. cmon
---
I agree with this post on so many levels. I too was a drunk at the Squad but only about 6 years ago. Now i'm a Sysadmin. Grind for those goals and profit in the end game content.
---
I agree it's kind of bullshit. And I don't understand the mentality of most of the replies to your post (at the present time), who are shitting on you for making a reasonable point about consistency.
---
What kind of a moody arsehole would respond in an insulting and non-constructive way to someone's post? People should probably start to act decently with each other. We're all friends that share the same hobby.
---
I stopped playing because trying to find a group to do a dungeon is something I just don't have the time or patience for anymore.
---
Classic wow needs a group finder tool like in retail (the tool people use to firm M+ groups) but it will never happen.
---
Having all tanks and healers be completely gimped when trying to farm or quest is also horrible.  The games needs some sort of dual spec system that doesn't involve spending 50g every time and then hoping you don't accidentally click the wrong talent.  Not like in current retail but, say, one free respec every 24h or something.  Again, it will never happen, and that's fine, but it's not the game for me in its 15-year-old state.
---
Except two people in different avs can get a large difference in honor. One can win av with 700 honor and one can win av with 3k hono with roughly the same game time.
---
That's fair...I'm just not enjoying the intentional fast loss, so hoping to make the grind a little less grindy.
---
But thanks for the very fair point.
---
The original AV, much like world pvp in vanilla, is something which was fun for a short amount of time before people hated the fuck out of it.  There is a reason it was streamlined and changed. People can want the OG AV all they want, but it would follow the same path.  People who think they want it would play it for a week or two, determine it's not longer interesting, and then bitch about how shit it was.  If it was the old AV as well, the hardcore honor farming people would avoid it as well further making it worse.
---
People are always going to bitch about something.
---
Yeah. It brings RNG so much more into the ranking equation than before. I'm not a fan of 1.12 AV for that reason, but it doesn't mean I'm gonna cry about people adapting strategies to it.
---
Human spirit is just %5 spirit boost, diplomacy is our rep boost
---
why would you waste your time making a shitty comment like this on reddit?
---
I played until 11:00 last night and thought it was a little later than I wanted to, I‚Äôd be fine. I usually operate on 6 hours of sleep. The moment my head hit the pillow I heard my 6 month old start to stir and cry... the wicked little murloc.
---
Ok, thx for the info
---
dont you farm rep faster by winning and getting tokens?
---
People play twinks for the gameplay at that level, not to stomp people not geared. Most people twinking in those lower brackets know that 90% of the people in that bracket are also twinks.
---
What's the point of being shitty like this? What is the actual point?
---
I played 1 AV game, we rushed Drek in ~ 10 mins, and I got a bunch of honor and rep.
---
I have absolutely zero incentive to play another AV until I feel like the rush meta is done with. It is incredibly dull and unnecessarily grindy. 
---
Honestly, the more pvp stuff that gets quashed in this game for me, just makes me yearn for League of Legends gameplay. I love WoW, but I'm not sure I love the end game that currently exists.
---
Time to craft a new macro. :)  
---
Just need to convince 10 people to join me in stopping the zerg...should be able to do it.

In classic wow, it's a common misconception that rank 14 is viewed as who won the most on "sports" day but it's actually just an attendance trophy for those who didn't miss a day of school all year long.
---
Lol im alliance and have yet to win a bg period
---
This is how you know your group was truly ready for Deadmines at level 17.
---
If you're just getting points for gear in arenas and don't care about ranking, it takes 2-3 weeks *minimum* to get a piece of gear.  And then it'll have a decent amount of its stat budget used on resilience, so it isn't even an optimal PvP piece.  The weapons were good but S3 and S4 required rating so you needed some actual skill to get them.  This is not to mention the many other benefits of arena (little to no griefing, doesn't require 12+ hour days, generally fair matches, etc).  BC's arenas were superior in basically every way.
---
2k honor per week vs 2k honor per *win*
---
I was thinking for a good minute what kind of word X D E E is supposed to be.
---
He's unhappy and is taking it out on others. Misery loves company.
---
I have honestly not had a single group like that lol
---
Obviously. Read the OP
---
Everyone isn't equal because people who don't zerg will get less honor/hour. They will pvp and stall the game, giving more rank to the zergers. But even the solo queue zergers will be overtaken by premades that maximize objectives AND end the game quickly.
---
We're the ones that got classic made in the forest place. Go back to BFA, troll.
---
Sure, but only because the average player isn't that good. In that same vein, anyone above R10 I would assume is better than the average player, but that doesn't make them a "really good" player. Just means they had more time to farm out AV
---
Any pvp is more than no pvp.
---
Yeah. And the smaller that faction is, the less competition it has.
---
Heard someone say this in my last av. Nobody is pvping because all the ally rush drek so horde are just waiting around to get a few random kills on ally, or kill bal and afk like the game is over.
---
This was me last night (BG release)
---
Warriors have the highest raid DPS and are the only viable raid tanks for almost all encounters. There's almost nothing in endgame content that a Mage can do better than a Warrior. Mages having a highly favored matchup against Warriors in solo PVP isn't really a argument toward their being the best class.
---
That should be a Devilsaur or King Mosh back there and you‚Äôre lvl 49.
---
BOOM! You‚Äôre dead.
---
More like 2-3 times.
---
Notice what?
---
Hi spangebab it‚Äôs scripted
---
&gt;Not even a little tiny bit. Life rewards you for being the best, literally never played basketball but are naturally better than Michael Jordan? You're gonna go play in the NBA.
---
Yeah but that is also literally not even a thing. The people who are best at basketball are the people who put the time and dedication into it.
---
It's like not missing a day of school, doing every single bit of homework and studying to get a 4.0, doing every single extra curricular activity, taking extra online classes, and abandoning every other hobby/social-aspect/responsibility in your life.
---
In classic wow, it's a common misconsception that rank 14 is something that was even possible for normal people to do. It's not.
---

---
Blizzard still trying to make retail work... It just wont lol
---
Definitely know the feeling man! I started back in early BC in 6th grade, but was an altaholic and had like 6 toons and only reached 40 with my warrior. Never got my first mount before I had to cancel my sub (got grounded and my mom canceled it lol you know how it is). Was really sad having to leave the game when it was in its prime, but Classic has allowed me to experience the game for the first time all over again. Definitely not quite the same experience...it's a solved game now, and everything was a mystery back then (i remember seeing people with legendaries etc. and being like WTF IS THAT), but it's been a blast. Might get flamed, but I'm really hoping BC (and maybe Wrath) will come eventually too, because I also never got to see Outland or Northrend back then.
---
Counterweight works
---
Strange that a pointless profession is giving me 50s-2g+ profit per potion.  People will be buying even more as other raids become available.  Transmuting arcane crystals is usually 7-10g every two days.  It's just free money for doing nothing.
---
You get rep which has good to great gear. Pvpong a couple few hours a day is probably enough to get you a high enough rank for the good gear too (maybe up to rank 10)
---
That's where the comparison to trench warfare came from.  You're basically charging into their front line with the hopes of breaking it but you're the most vulnerable because of that necessary positioning.  I find that miserable because if 3 Mages could blow the shit out of you before heals could make a difference.
---
What gives you that impression? Fact is, right there on the screen you can see he's vendored an AV quest reward.
---
except you can't queue with premades for some fucking reason, so no, you can't find a guild to try hard with
---
It wasn't taken out, it's just not out. It came out after vanilla.
---
Also voting for changes in a game is a meme, it's funny people mention it so much.
---
I started as #nochanges, but this AV has made me switch sides. The last match I was in, only 3 people died in the 7 minute match, and I'm sure they likely died to NPCs and not other players. If changes means fixing AV to be an actual battleground, instead of a fast &amp; furious street race, I'm okay with it.
---
D'ah! Now you're making me angry!
---
The 30 minute turtles I had yesterday were the most enjoyable AVs...
---
This doesn't even mean anything anymore. 
---
Do you mean no changes to classic? Or no changes to what it was like then? Because stats existed then, but not in classic .... so this stupid flippant phrase gets to mean anything you want it to, making it actually mean nothing.
---
Comment is proven false and not deleted.
---
I love how all toxic kids picked the same few problematic servers
---
What are you talking about? AV used to be super fun before the zerg meta changes. I mean, if you like Raid vs. Raid PvP wars of attrition.
---
WSG is far less honor per hour, especially if you lose the game.
---
"No changes" is, by definition, impossible.
---
The first time around, every bit of content was brand new and completely unknown. No matter how hard Blizzard sticks to "no changes", everything will still be very different from before by sole virtue of the fact that all of the content has been solved years before. As soon as Naxx is released, everyone will already know every fight in there. There won't be the same trial and error, because we already know the fights, and even if we don't, there are already resources detailing it all perfectly.
---
This is why I lean away from "no changes". It's am impossible goal. I want a version of the game which emulates what vanilla was about, but it doesn't need to be strictly the same. That means I support them fixing issues here and there, even though they existed in vanilla. I don't want a bug to exist simply because it existed back then. And I support them fixing bad balance and design decisions, even though they existed in vanilla. And so on.
---
Jesus christ. The "rOsE-CoLoReD" idiots were the same people who didn't want Classic made in the first place.
---
Now you're here, playing the product you didn't want, demanding it be changed to be closer to the version of the game you left, to play the version you argued against existing in the first place. 
---
/#NoChanges is such a stupid fucking strawman. That crowd already lost the argument. The "rOsE-CoLoReD" brigading has already been proven wrong as hell.
---
Fuck. Off.
---
Ignore the white knights, they don‚Äôt know how the world works.
---
I hope not. If folk can change their names and such then it takes way from the character investment and building a reputation. for me that was huge in vanilla and it vanished when players could transfer easily and change their look and name easily. 
---
These kinda changes would lead me to stop playing again, as the game would change again. 
---
Who knows what Blizz are planning, but only time will tell ;)
---
If that were true then why did twinking die oncd they were section off to fight eachother?
---
I'm fine with this.
---
Is the community really that soft? Were people actually complaining about this another to change it from the original experience ?
---
Just another guy talking out of his ass, completely wrong about everything they assert as fact üòÇ
---
Which doesnt help get exalted faster for the good gear....
---
&gt; As an added note, I've got shit to do. I have maybe 2 hours to play on week nights, games could easily last longer than that and if I left then all my investment for that session evaporates
---
Then maybe they aren't for you. That's OK, you know. Not everything has to be made to your exact specifications. It's a part of being a responsible person to decide for oneself the value one gets out of an activity, and how best to spend their free time.
---
Go on a vacation
---
You could make this argument for every piece of gear in the game.
---
https://youtu.be/Chc9DwDkWn0
---
But you're not getting the same honor as people in other avs. If they are getting 3k honor and you're getting 700 per game. Then it matters.
---
Leveled a Death Knight through it when it launched, every game was unique with people trying different strata and a pretty even win rate
---
Started a new character through this week and every game is the same. Both teams rush past each other to focus the adds.
---
If the Alliance wipes early the horde wins
---
If the Alliance can't recap their middle tower once the horde move past the horde wins
---
If the Horde resistance in their base is even semi competent the horde wins
---
If the horde recaps literally any of the towers even once the horde wins
---
If everything goes perfectly and the Frostwolf towers are captured before the bunkers then the Alliance might win
---
This. Arena is probably the only one place in WoW where skill is actually evident.

IMO dungeon finder and remote BG queueing should be added to Classic, as they're both huge QoL improvements that don't really spoil the game experience. It just removes some of the most annoying aspects.
---
some president accident on a zeppelin
---
I agree, but I don't want to 'play Vanilla'. I also want a similar play experience to Vanilla.
---
To get that the game needs changes. Primarily the honor system.
---
AV right now is not what it was like in Vanilla. Not that it's the 1.12 patch or anything. But that players are treating it like a PvE race solely for honor/rep farming.
---
The way I remember Vanilla is before BGs were server wide. AV represented the battle between Horde and Ally on your server. Each game could take a whole night, or even week. People joined it for the experience of battling against the opposition and trying to get a win.  
---
You'd get to know opposition names etc. It was a huge part of being on a server IMO.
---
Right now AV ends in under an hour and players literally run past each other... IMO that's not the same as it was in Vanilla.
---
I'd be interested to see if blizzard can see / cares about the statistics of the wins and losses.
---
No? Just don't waste time if the drek zerg fails and everyone pointlessly turtles. Sorry you have a hard time grasping the concept of efficiency.
---
&gt;some president accident on a zeppelin
---
Already a post on here about a guy getting exalted in 14 hours.
---
Most them being RDruid + X
---
IMO the only problem with the honor system is that there is a limit as to how many people can achieve each rank. I understand what they were going for here (military style ranks) but it really just doesnt serve a purpose, like at all. Let people earn their weapons by playing and winning battles. You can still make it take forever long to discourage that being your primary source of gearing up but it also incentivizes people to keep doing pvp because eventually they'll get there.
---
you might be right
---
((((skill))))
---
The games classes are incredibly unbalanced. There very little skill when a Pvp geared and talent spriest/lock dumpster almost every class. Or a mage destroying a warrior.
---
Not to mention that engineering is so overpowered if you don't have it, you're usually fucked by someone who has their trinkets.
---
I personally prefer 3 and 4, I think if it was me I'd go with 3 because I like the darker hair but the hair on 4 is nice if you're into that - I just always tend to prefer matching to contrast, yaknow?   
---
I think the first face was a bit happy... buuuut on looking at it more, it is the nicest face. Yeah, no, now I look at it more I'm much more inclined towards 1 or 2.   
---
My vote is for 1. It's a really unique look, suits the reference picture, and who says locks all have to be angry? Maybe this particular one is really friendly, and treats her demons well. Maybe they love being summoned by her. Definitely #1. I'd love to see this toon slowly gear up and become a master of Fel magic :D
---
Looks like a musical.
---
I should have taken the free transfer off Faerlina and gone to a low pop realm. Increase my chances of getting R14 and eventually playing on a dead realm!
---
Takes me back, i played every class on woe till level 30 then started a different toon. 
---
I played a lot of dead mines over and over again
---
I had a skullflame shield drop when we were in the enemy final boss area.  I won it lol.  No idea who was killing mobs in that area even capable of dropping it.
---
Comparing BoP blues to BoE greens... Yes go ahead and get blacklisted by your server see if we give a shit lmao
---
Because it's absurd enough to be an obvious joke.
---
Hey hope things get better for you, I can relate with the aging parents in particular (I'm 31 and my parents are 80-85) and I'm noticing some bad memory loss in my dad
---
it seemed okay when i was grinding the harpy cave yesterday but didnt play enought to know. The first few AV quest are really good xp tho
---
There was zero chance Classic was ever going to be anything like Vanilla.  There are too many resources out there now and players have become much better at WoW overall since then.
---
Rich/successful people are not playing for 8 or more hours a day.  Unless you‚Äôre just skipping that part and totally misreading?
---
Quality photoshop
---
the class who scale harder than anyone despite being top DPS in blue pre-bis... and who turn into absolute killing machine with a pocket healer?
---
I really didn't need to put the first half of that, did I? But I figured I'd leave it in there, to show the thought process yaknow?   
---
What were you thinking for a name btw?
---
So Soda poppin is now Sorda stoppin?
---
The whole point of the system, and MMOs in general, is for not everyone to have the same gear.
---
Disagree, but it's anecdotal.
---
Are you talking about the reset?
---
It's going to be mostly random because I got a couple bad games just before the reset and once it was back up I got about 3-4 in a row which were fast.  If anything it's probably just lucky/unlucky on your part.
---
#NoChanges has been irrelevant since they increased the server population.
---
&gt; what were you expecting?
---
That Classic was gonna have half as much effort put into it as Nostalrius.
---
But, alas, it's modern Blizz.
---
Yeah, I'm sure it's just anecdotal.
---
laughts in warrior .. until I notice he doesn¬¥t have to fear me to kill me..
---
&gt;If I want a continually improved game I'll play BFA.
---
The irony dripping off of this statement alone has soaked through my keyboard onto my desk.
---
So it's the same as AV on retail
---
Causally pvping still get you rep, with that there are some pretty amazing rewards to buy that are on par or better than what could drop in raids.
---
Strange server.
---
In 7 minutes?
---
Friday-monday (inclusive). There's going to be additional NPCs from that battleground around cities.
---
ok zoomer
---
We usually spent 2 hr doing BT and 2 hr doing SW, a total of 4 hr raiding every week.  So at least the PVE part is still brain dead in TBC.
---
Fix bayonets and wait for the whistle.
---
Not _quite_ that simple, because hit will affect your raid's dps too through more imp SB procs. But that's real nitpick stuff that almost everyone can ignore.
---
Same, I was late to work today because I playera AV untill 1am.
---
It's basically 27 int vs 16 healing, most people would rather 27 int.
---
Why would they remove the content of this post? None of it was offensive in any way :/
---
I think he's referring to the transition between zones not being seamless. it's most noticeable when leaving a city like Org or UC. that's not related to sharding at all
---
Your buddy is pretty dead on I would say.
---
Agreed, spending thousands of hours on something should make you very good at that thing.
---
Replacing an ork with an orc is beautiful
---
&lt;3
---
I don't get the point of this post?  We're not playing with the version that stalls out so this isn't even an issue.  If you're suggesting that it be changed to the version that does stall out then I'd throw this back at you:
---
&gt;Then maybe they aren't for you. That's OK, you know. Not everything has to be made to your exact specifications.
---
I cant agree more with you.
---
Yeap!
---
Yes, everybody *except for you* has been complaining incessantly for months. Only *your* complaint is a one-off exception to the rule.
---
&gt;Actually, I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs easier to do a physically demanding job on minimal sleep. 
---
I'm not usually this bold, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess which category you fall into...
---
Yea its like instant-2min tops
---
Doensn't work nearly as good for Druid with Hearthstone for several reasons:
---
a) Hearthstone and Heal have different animations (the hearthstone animation is shared with the Wrath-cast but heal looks differently)
---
b) more importantly: The Hearthstone is on the GCD! So starting to cast a heal and then using /stopcasting and /use Hearhtstone only works when you have waited for 1.5 seconds
---
So the only thing you can realistically do is using the hearthstone and hope people mistake it for your heal, you can't fake out their castbar-addon like you can with the Vendorstrike-trick.
---
I love and encourage this in my AVs. Please filter the idiots.
---
Yeah, no PvP. Nice and relaxing. :)
---
I DL it from directly from their website.
---
 or [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity)status
---
I got vis'kag first ever ony kill while pugging in a guilds group. Rolled 98 against 14 other people
---
yeah.. why would you guve us classic as it was !
---
I mean sure. To me it seems like a strange way to spend your time.
---
Actively avoiding the activity in order for a reward.
---
As I've said I think there's a substantial proportion of the playerbase who would jump 10000 times a night in Org and do nothing else if it lead to a piece of gear which was 1% better than other gear.
---
That's just weird to me. It seems like players are just addicted to the variable reward response than they are actually enjoying playing the game.
---
And yet the PvP blues people are getting now weren't available until P6.
---
Gametime and effective game time is 2 different things my friend.
---
They will cry about everything. 1st it was the fact that DM was released 2 weeks earlier on the timeline than it was in retail. - Literally unplayable, blizzard ruined the game. 
---
then it was "honor system is killing the game" because people thought they wanted a pvp server but realized they wanted a pve server, but instead of blaming themselves for their poor choices - its blizzards fault!!
---
Now its "AV is not the way we wanted it" (this one i kinda agree on though - truth be told) because its just a zerg fest and towers mean nothing for honor grinders doing AV. 
---
I have come to the conclusion that nothing blizzard will do will be ok with the loud minority of the community.
---
wait, are you complaining about pvp happening in a battleground?
---
Nope, that was how it used to be in Vanilla.
---
Mostly depends how many lok'amir drop off nef for your guild.
---
or  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/status](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/status)
---
I heard the reset was because u could summon flag carriers in wsg, av is exactly the same as b4 reset
---
Wife's water just broke
---
Last night in AV, as a Horde player we were clearing bunkers and such.  Out of the 5 I played, we lost 4 of them.  In those 5 games, the Horde had more honor than the Alliance.
---
Maybe people need to re-think the "zerg Drek/Van" strat that seems to be the meta.
---
&gt; I did respond to what you wrote and what he wrote.
---
If you did, then you would've at least answered the questions I made instead of giving generalistic responses. 
---
&gt; He was stating that the horde were "chill" on the server.
---
Aye, that seems to be his experience in playing on the server. 
---
&gt; This statement is not a factual statement,
---
Of course not, it's something he noticed, which implies it's simply his opinion. Furthermore, such a thing could very well be written as something relative, relative to say the server he came from. The Horde might've been much more aggressive on the server he came from. 
---
Have you played on *any* other servers to be able to refute his description if it is meant in a relative fashion (which is how I would perceive such a comment)?
---
&gt; nor is representative to the horde as a whole on the server.
---
Take a look at what he wrote: *"They usually just mind their own business and don't gank lowbies"*
---
That clearly states he isn't talking about every single Horde out there, but rather implies he is only talking about the ones he has encountered so far. 
---
&gt; On top of this, I would very much like to see a typical play session by him 2-3 hours where we can see these "chill" horde and he isn't ganked. I'm not ranting, I'm pointing out he and you are not being truthful.
---
All I'm seeing is you are trying to do is complain about someone giving an anecdote and using that to describe his experience, while you are using your own anecdotes to counterargue. Neither of you have a good case using such flawed evidence. 
---
&gt; But please continue painting a picture of the server that isn't there. /cheers
---
Why are you writing this to me? I've said no such thing and simply pointed out flaws in your logic.
---
You can easily get a premade of 5 and get 3k honor every win.
---
Oh AB is definitely favorite BG, from vanilla to whatever version of retail it was in.
---
That doesn't change the fact that I want the rep rewards from AV and I'd rather get it done as soon as possible so I can play AB *for fun*
---
Yes it is, idiot. It will take you morons exactly 5x as long to get the rep and the honor from winning is not shown on the screen. But that doesn't matter.
---
How is that even possible?
---
Say what now? DMN solo farm alone is the best gold maker in the game that is completely non RNG reliant. Selling stuff from the tribute is just icing on the cake you don‚Äôt even need to do to still make serious bank for relatively little effort once you have done it a few times.
---
Sounds like some are trying to pvp in a pvp game mode.
---
Thanks for the thought process :)
---
I hope I can reply back, because it says my post was removed by a moderator (not sure why, I didn't break any rules I a aware of)? 
---
I'm deciding between #1 and #2 currently.
---
I agree, Warlocks can be cheery. They don't have to be serious. I'm just not sure about the gray hair. It goes, however... I feel it's something similar to how the Mages in Scarlet Mon would look with the grey and white hairs. I feel black will contrast my looks from other cloth wearers. 
---
It's a tough choice. 
---
I don't want to post my name yet because I don't want it to get taken, but I'm thinking something starting with a Z.
---
I‚Äôll break it down for you. 
---
Most people don‚Äôt enjoy AV, at all. They only play AV because they want the rewards. Rewards come from reputation grind. 
---
For many of these people, as soon as they get exalted with AV, they will never queue AV again -and spam WSG. 
---
So you can win 1 game in 30 mins that literally doesn‚Äôt matter. Or you can lose 5 in that time and gain more reputation. 
---
The quicker I get through this shit slog, the quicker I can get the gear I want and play the mode I want to with the best gear on
---
You aren't supposed to be in it the entire battle, there were AVs that lasted for days in vanilla. It is supposed to be a war, gathering resources and reinforcements, rescuing prisoners, capturing strategic points. Eventually leading to rallying the forces together to make tide changing pushes with wolf riders pushing the enemy back or griffins bombarding the enemy forces.
---
For a large portion of the minmaxers they play the game for a simulated sense of achievement rather than having fun. They enjoy the feeling of finishing bis similar to how it feels good to finish a school/work project. 
---
Many people end up with the majority of the communities they are a part of highly valuing minmaxing, and for you to be respected by this social group you need to bust your ass and grind too. It could be compared to being part of a work environment filled with A type workaholics. 
---
You want to chill out? Well then you become more of an old "dad" gamer, a casual who has lost their touch and a lot of respect from the communities they are socially dependent on.
---
I don‚Äôt know how AV became a zergfest but it‚Äôs not fun at all. Literally just run and get kill by large groups. Good honor I guess. But I just spend all my time riding to the end or getting chain downed at graveyards til I‚Äôm back at the entrance. I don‚Äôt know why anyone plays it.
---
Whether intended or not, that behavior isn't as important as you might think.  You can easily jump up the slope next to that house without dismounting, and it won't slow you down any compared to just running through.
---
It might take people a couple of games to catch on, but in the end there won't be any difference.
---
It is what it is with the ally bias of the map.  Horde won this morning by sending a few to defend while the north pushed on.
---
MoM should be better eventually. Slower swing speed and the -armor depends on how much armor the enemy has. The best is if the enemy has about 2100armor, then you get +27% making BRE around 96DPS.
---
But both the swing speed and stats are ridiculous on the hammer. It's no sword though, however the procs have to be up first on BRE.
---
But in the end who will have MoM and still PvP seriously?
---
Where are the shadow and fire offhands?
---
I'm not justifying it, simply stating why.
---
Yes and paladins don‚Äôt get any better considering later on they can be optimized and wearing full plate with a shield.
---
Yeah, horde losing the zerg but getting more honor was so obvious I am yet to see any horde complaint about that on this sub.
---
What's your next plan to do after hitting AV exalted?
---
&gt;Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keepin
---
Yea I was wondering that as well. All my stuff and links looks to be there right now.
---
It's as much griefing as responding to "How do I show my keyring" with "Alt-F4"
---
They make deodorant for sensitive skin, ya know.
---
Not true at all, there's a bunch of different pots people use and at least some of them will sell for a profit. If you pay attention to prices it can be quite profitable.
---
People dont want to play the game, they just want the reward via efficiency satisfaction that has been drilled into todays generation of gamers
---
I heard a few varying explanations for the reset.
---
One explanation was that they hadn't accidentally permitted cross-realm trading in BGs.
---
Another was that there was a bug allowing Priests to somehow become invulnerable and tank bosses in AV.
---
And a third was that there was an exploit involving the graveyards in WSG.
---
Honor could use some tuning but overall i like the system.  To me you could use better argument like... dual spec! But then there will be next guy who will say single spec is essential to classic. Story goes on!
---
Accurate
---
I enjoy asmon‚Äôs streams. Not a hater here, but why would dislikeing someone insinuate you are jealous of them?  You can dislike people for any number of reasons. I think jealously is one of the rarest reasons to genuinely dislike someone. It feels like people tote around saying jealousy is a super common to dislike someone.
---
OMG I want to play this so bad now.
---
People usually say kang is best as arms but I reckon this is a contender, you get 1% hit and huge strength and 3.80 speed.

Name checks out as a response to your comment
---
Take up masturbation and weed smoking.
---
My two favourite hobby‚Äôs.
---
I didn't say that you said it; someone else in the thread said it.
---
Neither was zerg farming honor across the open world.
---
&gt; and I had to sign up 24 hours in advance on google docs before every raid, which a little excessive to me.
---
try raid leading 40-man raids for a little bit then tell me if this extremely simple  and easy-to-do requirement ''sounds a little excessive ''
---
They are probably playing for rep and not so much honor
---
And maybe that makes sense if bgs were single server. But since its xrealm that was never going to be the case in classic, regardless of the version you got.
---
Perfected I used too strong as I said in another comment.  The QOL improvements are second to none in the industry.  I see that, and can appreciate that.
---
Damn you're stupid
---
I did like 10 av's before work. lost 6 or 7. Had a blast and leveled from 56 to 57 doing quest and junk. I like this version
---
I agree that stomping on non-twinks is nothing to be proud but you do get a lot of twink vs twink matches that are fun. In those cases it's often the people who put in the real time in that prevail, like getting the AGM trinket or the medicine pouch that gives them the edge over people who just put bought everything with gold.
---
And many of them were only doing it for the welfare epics because they couldn't get equivalent raid drops to actually fucking drop.
---
Which is always going to be a problem in PVE focused MMORPGs- the only thing to entice players with is loot that progresses their character to be more effective in PVE.
---
Good ol you think you do but you don't.
---
That guy wrecked his gaming career haha.  He deserves everything he gets for being such a waste of space.
---
We all know Clasic WoW has its flaws. The problem is who would fix them? I and most other #NoChanges drones do not believe Blizzard has people on the payroll capable of making a game as good as Classic WoW. Retail is proof of that.
---
Because people are bad. You are supposed to zerg but no go in half health with healers oom and half the people dead from warmasters. Thats how ally loses all their games.
---
Its so stupid as well when they dont pick up the free honor along the way...
---
This would be what I'd actually do but with current conditions, a premade that goes for objectives is at risk of getting reported/kicked if they're not with the zerg ball
---
&gt;You needed better parents.
---
well played sir

I'm using version 1.18 if it helps

It's 11 AM on a Wednesday afternoon ya dunce
---
If you want a group who are going to go a bit slower and will kill everything try and create yourself a group and actively call it a 'quest run' or 'EXP run'.
---
There are players out there (like me) who want to run dungeons like that. It's just we're tired of being told it's a waste of time or whatever so we do what you do, follow the tank and be quiet.
---
What's your point? 
---
Classic *is* the version with changes. Layering, sharding, international cross realm BGs etc.
---
They should fire whoever decided that Alterac 1.12 was gonna be implemented and hire some Frenchman from Nostalrius who was less idiotic.
---
https://blizzardwatch.com/2019/11/07/wow-classic-biggest-quarterly-subscription-increase/
---
The mythical "spirit of vanilla" can only be found with changes. This really should be clear to everyone by now.
---
You fell for typing /afk or taking a portal while inside a fucking battleground and want something done about it.  I normally hate these little "witty responses" but it's just too appropriate.
---
O K B O O M E R
---
ROFL at the mods in this place....
---
my guess is that you are falling for the emote "
---
/e has reported you as AFK. To remove this, type /Afk Deny or you will be removed from this battleground in 30 seconds"
---
If it is, stop typing /afk deny. It only registers the /afk part and will auto remove you. It is not that easy to remove someone from av. I have seen bots that i have spam reported that dont get removed.
---
Mount system.
---
It's also pay to win and some people are born at level 59, most at level 30, and a few have to start from level 1
---
*STREAMER BAD!*
---
Meh. Yeah but. Retail is similar.
---
Most of the conversations/debates worth even having have centered around how people are playing the game, flaws and all. There are very real split in the community based less on whether this or that flaw should be there, but how people take that flaw into consideration in their gameplay... which really comes down to gameplay preference and wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that in an MMO someone's preference is gonna get ruined by the majority.
---
Fuck spammers tho.
---
On a similar note, can anyone tell me if the rune of perfection from WSG is in the game?
---
I was specifically meaning whether or not we knew of his existence. Like we weren‚Äôt aware of Yogg-saron in vanilla (iirc), would be a little strange to RP someone whose life goal was to combat the influence of Yogg in the vanilla/classic era. I‚Äôd assume the same of loa followed by the Zandalari, since they were fairly secretive in vanilla.
---
But to each their own. Was just teasing you about potentially meta-gaming a loa from 7 expansions later into your character RP.
---
Lol yup. Add in my FR healing and tank set, my shadowresist set for pvp and a few other odd pieces of gear to mix in. Luckily just got my epic mount so now all my gold is going to bag n bank slots
---
If you're having fun, there is no rush. Continue what you are doing.
---
If you're not having fun but want to get 60 then choose a faster levelling method and farm BIS gear
---
no they just decided to do everything the way it was during 1.12. Fucking nochanges
---
this is some incomprehensible bullshit
---
First I need the epic mount, the pvp one is only 640 gold now tho :o
---
That‚Äôs true, really dumb when I think about it since it seems to be outstanding honor
---
No, you‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs been in the works long before you self important morons started crying in public on the daily.
---
Yes. Well equipped twinks ganking in level appropriate zones and lower was routine. Going up against drastically higher level opponents solo is rare enough that I have literally never seen it in the wild (outside of videos) either now, in vanilla or the time between.
---
Does it happen? Sure. But your attempt to paint this as the status quo rather than an outlier is laughable.
---
Literally the only reason vanilla didnt get more balancing was because the game moved on to new patches. If the game had stayed vanilla for longer people would've been screaming for balance changes. The #nochange crowd never existed. Everyone wanted the game more balanced then, there is nothing wrong with wanting it more balanced now.
---
This is why I have lost interest suddenly.  Honor per hour and pvp rep per hour concept shouldnt be the focus. My most fun was AV 33min match with 152 HK.  That was so much fun to clash in the middle! 
---
In wsg I have seen very lame anti pvp tactics of cc and run. (I thought cc was capped at 10sec, but I spent more time sapped, sheeped, than i did pvping).
---
It is not the game. It is the player mindset that changed.
---
Haha yea I don't get it either!
---
I had an AV turn into a turtle and we were playing tug of war between the first bunker and out base with the horde. Instead of rallying and organizing and fighting back, there were two or three voices continually insisting that we just let the horde win because it would be more rep and honor. Like, fuck that, why should we let them win? Let‚Äôs figure out how to win and have a good time. They can surrender to us if anyone is going to be surrendering. Bleh
---
You want a guild that is competent and doesn't wipe to extremely simple mechanics and will absolutely clear nax?
---
Well then you need fast MC clear times, day 1 BWL clears before speedrunning that as well.
---
You need the best gear possible to do this. AV gives good gear so you guild requires you to get the gear from it this week.
---
Now here we are.
---
I am fairly certain that the AV rewards are in the game but...
---
&gt;This means that consumables such as  Warsong Gulch Field Ration, added in 1.5, are available now while epic items such as  Windtalker's Wristguards. added in 1.6, are coming later. We have updated our item phase filters and reputation guides to account for this information.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=299484/warsong-gulch-vendor-item-clarifications-items-added-in-patch-1-6-coming-with-bw
---
He is not the bad guy here.
---
Av is sub 1 min queues for horde on the west coast server cluster. 
---
Wsg is about 10-15 mins. 
---
World pvp is quiet for the most part.
---
Yes I had that occasion yesterday with only 5 people but couldn't do it. I'll think about it.
---
I think Rank 14 is *just* enough for the nolifers to not kill themselves.
---
The rings aren't the only reward and typically the people not cooperating with the rush strat are people who don't even have PRE raid bis and could really benefit from the weapons...
---
And as far as rogue bis rings... it says band of accuria and tarnished elven. Well good fuckin luck getting band of accuria lol. Don Julios is far more attainable than that for the vast majority of these people.
---
Check some healing guides for the best downrabk of ur spells to use for efficiency, classic is easy. 4 people is enough for all except late ubrs(possible with epics probably) and u might have trouble with strat

A LEGEND

There is no nostalgia, I was playing them up until August of this year. Your lack of experience, and any knowledge on the subject what so ever is dog shit.

Great! So for me it might be until Sunday ^^ (I play a couple of hours any day but might have a special guest soon).

oh man I try, I do. Its partially due to time restraints as well. I have time to run the actual dungeon (usually the day before I all but walk up to the entrance, prep my bags etc) but it takes so fucking long to find that group that by the time we are all ACTUALLY ready to go - its been like 1-2 hours and I dont have time now to fully complete the actual dungeon. Super frustrating.
---
Agreed. In Vanilla I was a dungeon grinder because the delivery of the story wasn‚Äôt good enough for me. Now with Legion and BFA, I‚Äôm doing what you are.
---
Don't pretend that the only reason blizzard isn't changing things is to satisfy the #nochanges crowd. They are not changing anything because of the fact that they are directing as few resources as possible to Classic "development", while milking it for as much as they can until it dies.
---
I'm well aware it's from reputation, and Warriors get an epic 2H weapon. The Unstoppable Force. I said they want AV, not they want honour. That is a bonus.
---
But some of us are fine with that.  I Don't have to be in the top 1 percentile to enjoy the system.
---
I'll PvP as much as I enjoy and have fun seeing how high that can get me.  I don't think I'm entitled to rank 14 weapons so not getting there isn't an issue.
---
#nochangesexcepttheonesiwant
---
Literally the biggest reason most of this godforsaken community even wanted classic is because it is wildly unfair and unbalanced.
---
If you wipe on drek and the horde doesnt kill van, youre wasting time if you dont afk out. Waiting the 15 min deserter is better than wasting an hour+ in some scuffed turtle.
---
And that's worse than killing a snoozefest boss like golemagg for a low drop rate caster sword how?
---
Is this supposed to be funny?
---
Right, but it still means our best way to honor grind is face roll, so the premades winning WSG and people still trying to world PvP are behind.
---
well sure but then trying to win fucks your honor gain compared to your fellow horde, so  basically you farm honor and rep will come anyway.
---
What region are you in? NA horde has much bigger queues than that
---
&gt; I‚Äôve heard boars or spiders are good for their cc,
---
Second line of the post. 
---
&gt; Like, who the fuck has the time to dig through an entire thread like that
---
It has ten less comments than this one.
---
&gt; Remember when I said you should probably learn to read
---
Kinda funny, huh?
---
Im sure we can all agree exploiting is not best for everyone except for the person exploiting.  There is no preferences or debate on exploits and if it should be changed. Exploit Is an exploit. Get it fixed , end od story.
---
&gt; Honor system's epics are impossible to obtain for casual players, and near-impossible for even most serious players.
---
Which is one of the main things people liked about Vanilla: Less welfare epics.
---
Your miserable time is what we experienced literally the entire time before the honor system released.. and y‚Äôall were shit talking us and calling us babies the entire time too. 
---
Getting camped 10x is over 2.5x worse than camped 4x times because you have max res timer for more of the deaths. It sucks, but it definitely could be A LOT worse for y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm trying to put things into perspective and obviously doing a shitty job at it
---
This wouldn't work either, people's objectives would be based on the predicted release path. So they'd be doing content based on the most efficient setup to be most effective when the next patch drops.
---
I stand corrected.....
---
Welcome, tis a fine vintage!
---
Hey I have an idea everyone! Let's split the community into 3 different versions. Classic, in between, and retail. Then when people become unhappy we can simply branch off and create more versions until we have a perfect game for everyone. E z *clap*
---
who wants to break it to him?
---
But I'm literally only here browsing /new because I enjoy the hell out of these posts. They get me through the day lol
---
That's a great comment, I think you're totally right as to why this playstyle is so prominent. Though I disagree slightly.
---
&gt; They enjoy the feeling of finishing bis similar to how it feels good to finish a school/work project.
---
I totally get that. But not all checklists are created equal. If this were the main motivator then I'd assume we'd see more people collecting T0 sets as well (personally I've only encountered 1 other person who wants to do this). It's a checklist, why not complete it?
---
IMO gear is the main way to display status in this game. So the best way to gain status is attaining the best gear. That means completing your BiS list. Not only that, but completing the *right* BiS list.   
---
I see it all the time on this subreddit: "Er that's not BiS you idiot. XXX is actually BiS what list are you looking at"
---
&gt; You want to chill out? Well then you become more of an old "dad" gamer, a casual who has lost their touch and respect from the communities they are socially dependent on.
---
Yeah, I know. Though I wouldn't say that means I've 'lost my touch'. I'm just as a good a gamer as I used to be (more or less, I was never that great at WoW). My priorities no longer align with the majority of the playerbase.    
---
I'm taking more time to actually consider what it is I want out of WoW, because I still love it as a game.    
---
I think I'll have to be more proactive in searching out a community and creating the experiences I want to be a part of. Just attempting to join the mainstream community isn't what I want. Much like how joining a company full of type A people isn't what I'd want either.
---
Thanks! Out of curiosity  what server are you on? You seem like a nice person.
---
I plan to play on Westfall. But if the people on your server are like you, I might reconsider. 
---
I was thinking of Bloodsail for the RP.
---
It is because you just quickly get the 3 insignias every 7 minutes. Most rep.
---
&gt;9pm feels about sufficient time spent with mrs and encourage her to go bed
---
"Get better" ya ok. If you think AV turtle is somehow a skill up we just aren't even on the same level of mindset. I enjoy organized 5v5s with horde on my server. That's "real pvp" to myself. Everything else is just a grind, why wouldn't i min/max that?
---
SS or it didnt happen
---
First BG I joined there was a half-twinked NE hunter with some variation of the name Legolas who immediately started shitting all over anyone below 19 in the chat and did /spit on several of them. Spent the whole time whining about how the lowbies were ruining everything for him. Wtf?
---
WSG queues are instant for me. How long are they for horde?
---
I like the rock-paper-scissors balance because avoiding it led to the homogenization that took some of the fun out of WoW for me - the quirks and imbalances make it feel more like a real RPG. 
---
PvP can be a blast, but you just gotta accept that sometimes you have to either actually just straight be that much better at the game (rarely, if you're up against a hard counter in a 15 year old game), or get lucky.
---
That‚Äôs a risky website click if you aren‚Äôt apart of this community.
---
Yes please punish me because other people played badly, that's awesome. 
---
Please go apply for a job at Blizzard, the quality of your ideas are on par for the current company and you'd be right at home working on Shadowlands.
---
Tried telling people this repeatadly on the run up to release. Constantly downvoted.
---
We needed rebalanced bosses, we needed rebalnced mobs, I'd even 'randomise' the loot tables so not all the best gear for healers is in DM, or all the warrior gear in UBSR/BRD. Spread it out a little to encourage grouping everywhere.
---
Flat dmg.
---
Rank 14 spellblade was "added in" later. It didn't exist until  1.11
---
Soooo... a Diablo hardcore character?
---
Because he isn't bitter like you've become after speedrunning this game for 3 months.
---
[You were saying?](https://i.imgur.com/YlHZ5ZL.png)
---
Out of the 88 games I've played, only 4 games were under 20 minutes. Average time was 57 minutes with a peak of 4hours 32 minutes. All of this is according to my REflex addon.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/stormreaver/sockfullafel/pvp
---
I agree. People forget the 30 afk bots on your team fishing or mining endlessly, endless q times because people never logged off or left. Og AV was ass
---
That's subjective, whether you consider the tradeoffs worth it.
---
My favorite is when the poopsocks start losing their minds when the  servers go down for a few hours every couple months.
---
ahh I See - yeah been a while since I played retail obviously haha. But there it sounds like the zones are not all current timeline and chromie is used as a retcon device. 
---
Vs im saying make the current world all coherently in 1 spot and then also allow visions into the past. Idk if thats exactly how it is in retail but it sounds from these descriptions that shes used to gloss over the fact that whats actually happening on screen doesnt make sense which isnt exactly what I was going for.
---
Seriously?  There's tons of exalted alliance, especially humans.  Plenty of streamers as well.
---
Can confirm, AV is the new farm zone. XD
---
That's not even close to true.  I wish it were, but it isn't.
---
Some people are naturally amazing athletes, some people aren't.  Everyone who makes it to the NBA is naturally gifted, the average person could train twice as hard as them and still never make it.
---
If you like retail AV so much maybe go back to retail?
---
Honour per game being higher doesn't mean the Honour per hour isn't faster rushing.
---
props for the 10 year old meme throwback... #nochanges
---
Go spread some liberalism elsewhere.
---
When you have nothing else in your life it‚Äôs an accomplishment
---
And this is why Classic will have these issues.
---
Playing games to play the games ins't the goal anymore. Playing a game is just a chore for more internet points and e-peen.
---
People like you are the exact reason retail is in the state its in, and the reason classic is having the problems it's having.
---
If you just want the most EZ mode to get the gear you want rather than actually playing the game, go to retail.
---
Nope. It is supposed to make you react in any way :)
---
Easy bait.
---
Irs because they can have their farm rep quick and they think they can progress through ranks faster because of much honor.  They treat it like a pve grind. And av is not supposed to be that.
---
There was plenty of double dps (mage/rogue, double mage, mage/lock, lock/spriest, as examples) that were very strong with high representation. There was also strong representation of other healers in dps/healer combos, which all also did very well.
---
The only comp that was broken and used rdruid was double rdruid in 2s. Literally unkillable, wasn‚Äôt killing anything that had a healer, and designed entirely to wait you out until you gave up (cuz yay no time limits).
---
Ah, the OSRS approach to gaming.
---
Outside world
---
They aren‚Äôt pirated you ignorant swine. They are emulated. Take into consideration that private servers provided a vanilla experience for many years, because they are passionate about this version of the game. The same game you are groveling to,  and getting on your knees to suck blizzards corporate cock for.  It‚Äôs not a surprise though usually trash players always have a trash experience.
---
Dude you're complaining about a great item that you're guaranteed to get, with absolutely 0 need to roll or compete with others, with a minimum of 14 hours invested. In terms of efficiency in MMOs, what else do you want?
---
You don't even need half. I'm a warrior tank and turtled with a smart Hunter. We were able to delay the alliance pulls long enough for horde to win. So far I'm 2-0 using this strat, the first game was a priest mage and I and it was unfair.
---
Yeah, glad Blizzard went ahead and added cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Get a ‚ÄúDing‚Äù timer for that extra potato feeling!
---
I'm sick of the apparently endless whining and complaining clogging up /new and was going to unsub. Then I thought I'd see if there's a way to filter out the whining. Bingo! Now the sub isn't shitting up my feed.
---
I'll let you in on a secret... Most of those "roam" fights you had weren't anywhere near fair either.
---
Because they are gimped in vanilla.
---
Is that pvp or pve. If not pvp much less interesting
---
Who are those people and why should we care?
---
I mean i didnt play all night like most people but ive done 2 av and 3 wsg and lost them all. Didnt even get a flag cap in wsg at all
---
On mine it's a bit skewed because Alliance have near-instant pops on the queue for AV.
---
I'm fully aware of what you mean, I think they same thing (If I say you are a 5 out of 10 I don't mean you are unattractive, I mean that you are neither attractive nor unattractive). 
---
That being said, comparing to the average player isn't always a useful metric. The average player's skill speaks nothing to the minimum needed in certain high skill scenario's. You could be "really good" compared to an average player, but still have no idea how to coordinate with others or how to min/max. Especially in the AV context, where it's literally just about spending more time than others.
---
When people say "really good" they mean that they could hold their own in a competition with top tier players. Average players weren't even a factor in that equation. It's like being a random 3rd string person on a sports team, sure you are good enough to get there, but you aren't "really good" otherwise you'd be starting on the field.
---
Thanks for info, im an ignorant warrior. But either way, the people who are screwing over the rush strat are usually people who don't raid much, are still wearing blues/greens, and could really use the weapons/off hands/jewelry from the rep.
---
90%...that‚Äôs way off there.
---
Take a look at the gear sold at varying rep levels.
---
I can say for AV exalted, it has some gear that is best in slot until Naxx comes out.
---
I grinded AV for about 4 hours last night and despite losing most matches, i made decent progress towards exalted.  Definitely worth doing.
---
That's where the inspiration came from but with the time investment of classic wow leveling it creates a much bigger risk!
---
yes, exactly.
---
this is why i'm happy everytime I end up with 39 random people who understand how to get maximal honor ; this give me an edge over those who end up with 39 random people who rush vanndar.
---
I'm not playing AV to win, I'm playing AV to max my honor gains. I will not rush vann when the lt. and balinda are up, I will not participate or try to initiate a turtle...
---
TotemTimers broke a few weeks ago for me. I switch to Samy which lacks the lightning shield, ankh, and weapon buff aspects of TT. I supplemented Samy with some WeakAuras.
---
This patch broke the actual active totem timer component of Samy, but not the totem selection interface buttons. So you can still use it for the modular keybinds. Wago.io has a number of totem timer auras you can import if that's something you'd be willing to compromise with. Hopefully TT is updated sooner rather than later so I can go back to the ideal setup.
---
More likely, the majority of people don't want to be in AV any longer than they have to in order to get the grind done with so they can get back to pve.
---
&gt; Because of decay at some point for high ranks you're going to need to put in weeks where you're going HARD for 7 days straight and that's just simply impossible with some people's life style.
---
I know this is a little unfair/dismissive, but it shouldn't be or ever have been possible with anyone's life-style, regardless of age. But I'm with you, the biggest issue is not making things time gated, it's making them unachievable unless you concentrate that time into a specifically sized window.
---
Counterweight, yes...anything "on hit", no.
---
^^What was that subreddit called again where you can post comments without context?
---
first they blame paladins then they blame terrain...
---
You cant progress to grand marshal that fast if everyone else also get this much honor.  People in faction compete for ranks between each other.
---
For me, AQ has always been the instance, which is past the portals...that should be the zone 'half' that was cut off when Silithus was redone for the AQ War.
---
I'm drawing a blank on if the area past the outer gate (that's sealed until after War Effort), but before the portals, is actually called something.
---
Someone mentioned Ruins of AQ, but I thought that was AQ20???
---
Tauren of course
---
People forget that the game has been out for 15 years. The player base is more knowledgeable. People didn‚Äôt play the way they do now.
---
so its just +7 damage added to each shot?  
---
Is it affected by AP?
---
They weren't for most of BC, and even later on only weapons were gated.
---
Haha i actually unsubscribed because my daughter was born in august. Adult responsibilities have caught up with me. I do miss playing sometimes though. Might start again when she's older.
---
I specifically referred to the group finder tool, not the instant match-making dungeon finder.  I also specifically mentioned limits on the amount of respecs.  Maybe you should learn to read.
---
Personally from what ive heard is it should be a passion project.
---
Common consences is from most ppl ive spoken too is follow to tob and lich king. And that is a good few years head start for the classic team to make new decisions for the universe to take
---
What's the most (pvp) ranks you can go up in one week?
---
...and then QQing about it on reddit.
---
People are strange. They're basically saying "I know what I want and like, but I'll do something I hate so I can complain about it."
---
There's nothing to theorycraft in Classic.  The best metas have been known for over a decade.
---
Brutal honestly would be "expecting activision-blizzard to do vanilla justice is nonsensical".
---
Shoo-ing our fellow players is a... It's not nice.
---
By tomorrow most of the Alliance that really care will be Exalted.  Compare that to your 2-3 weeks and you'll understand the Alliance strategy.
---
Yes that's probably the only reason he plays this game. Good job you should tell more people to quit Classic.
---
my friend is already exalted, im about to hit rev...
---
its about 14-20 hours depending for exalted with Frostwolf(AV)
---
1) I don't see what the big issue is with Shattrath. Unless one has a personal love for, say, Orgrimmar or Stormwind. Is it really any different from, say, Darnassus being semi-deserted because everybody is in SW and IF? And personally I found Shatt much easier to navigate than most Azeroth capitals. Oh, and you still had to go back to those for the AH, which is generally the main reason for being in a capital city to begin with (aside from the bank)
---
2) What's the big deal with daily quests in TBC? They were mostly a way of making gold outside of farming stuff for the AH - and btw, it was still much more profitable to farm mats if you knew what you were doing. Personally I find much less braindead and more enjoyable to do some repeatable quests with objectives than killing mobs for hours in a cave.
---
3) Unless one is especially fanatic about large scale PvP (and I doubt we have many of those left, after the debauchery that phase 2 was), what's the harm with flying mounts in TBC? It allowed players who had already "finished the game" in terms of levelling etc. to actually reach the raids/dungeons/farming grounds they were interested in. I for one would love to be able to fly right into BRM without having to walk my way every damn week. Imagine having to get to Gruul's Lair on foot, fighting your way through hordes of elite Ogres everytime. Thanks but I'd rather not.
---
4) What's so unintuitive about TBC's tiered system? Can it possibly be any more unintuitive than all the weird and convoluted stuff we have in Vanilla Pve?
---
5) You're not wrong about Arenas, but they really didn't have any major impact on class design until after TBC. In TBC classes were still very diversified - much more so than Vanilla - and any decent raid or heroic dungeon party had to carefully plan their composition without simply "bringing the player, not the class".
---
I don't see why we're blaming TBC for things that ruined the game AFTER TBC. That's like saying that Classic sucks because it had catch-up gear - despite the fact catch-up gear didn't get out of hand until WotLK and later.
---
I dont think its possible to work full time, get 6-7 hours of sleep, and get Rank 14.
---
But this is completely wrong. 
---
I do want to play the game. I want to play Warsong gulch. I don‚Äôt give a shit about rewards in there, I do it because it‚Äôs fun. 
---
The problem with the game, is that really powerful rewards like Don Julio‚Äôs and the weapons, are gated behind a really stupid reputation grind. 
---
So if I want to play the game that I want to play, the way I want, with the gear I want, first I have to slog through a day of reputation grind.
---
OH MAN. I totally forgot about summoning mini bosses to help you push. Man, mutli hr AV &gt; 15 min AV every day.
---
Is there any good mage gear?
---

Rend as soon as you can. He won't be able to heal himself (only 1 bandage tick) or stealth for very long (three seconds).
---
I'm not saying that anyone can do it. With the NBA being 6'7 definitely helps you get on the team. But if you want to be good at basketball, you need to put in the time and effort to get better at basketball. If you want to be a good dentist, get out there and start dentisting. The people who play WoW 19 hours a day every day tend to be pretty good at WoW. Are there people who play a couple hours a day who are better? Absolutely. But that was never the argument being made.
---
It's added to your weapon damage, so it should be.
---
Because 5 hour queues aren't fun.
---
"While we don‚Äôt have an exact number...."
---
Warsong gulch. 
---
I literally just explained that. 
---
I enjoy PvP. I enjoy doing it in the best gear. 
---
I am playing the game so I can PvP, in the best gear.
---
Free action, jump. Solved =)
---
The spots are filled damn near instantly, and the prank is done before the gates open.
---
Stop trying to be altruistic about your butthurt
---
Yeah, kinda half disappointed in how easy everything has been sofar. The leveling seemed pretty close, but all the dungeons are fairly easy.
---
And from that perspective, I think Vanilla Honor system does its job.
---
It offers BiS loot, but its difficult enough to get that most people aren't going to farm it instead of raiding.
---
Because he is the world's first level 60!  Let me clue you in on who he is? He was the world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. He can do whatever the fuck he wants. You think he is a random player? You think he is a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. He is the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Him, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. He can do whatever the fuck he wants.
---
This is sweet. Exact same thing here. My dad and I played 19 and 29. It was a lot of fun gearing up and helping each other with dungeon runs and things like Gurubashi and the fishing contest too.
---
Damn - that what the title should have been!
---
TFW retail is more classic than classic.
---
PVE alliance gets their exalted faster then forget about AV since they can go to the open world again.
---
Met a rogue in uldaman while leveling. 2 priests and 2 rogues who were pretty underlevelled. I didn't think we would get the final boss down but we completed the run with no wipes. Now one of those rogues is in almost every dungeon I run, with a few other friends. We just completed DM tribute last night with a 56, 57, 59, and 2 60's. Never thought we could finish that one without a full group of 60's.
---
You realize the guy I replied to was referencing implementing 1.5 instead of 1.12, right? The no changes people would lose their goddamn minds over a change like that.
---
Thank you for apologizing. A lot of shitty tanks don't pay attention to mana bars and are part of the reason there's such a stereotype about them to begin with.
---
I've become numb to this, but I'm totally with you
---
lets love each other again
---
Yes this is weird to me. Back in the day we would log on to Counter Strike (and other games) to frag and have fun for that sole reason. It's almost like people today are almost more interested in games for the ranking/reward type built in to for them to advance themselves, versus just playing for the sake of it.
---
Every sane person in europe speak english lol
---
Im not doing this for rep tho, im doing this for honor. And again, its not like i lose every game. So what's the downside exactly if horde is getting 2-3 times more honor than alliance per AV?
---
I'm trying to understand ally POV here and trying to see how this won't devolve into just giant queue times a month from now. Feel me?
---
So maybe it wasnt about competition
---
It‚Äôs cool as fuck that people are feeling this way for wow again. Hell yea bro‚Äôs
---
If horde, go to hinterlands.  Bunch of quests.
---
Rep rewards
---
The horde are mostly morons. They just want fast honor and rep and don't care about rolling over like pathetic pig dog waste. No pride, no sense of indignation. Just honor/rep whores.
---
Another hypothetical with no evidence of it happening
---
4 man is fine until raids üòÇ
---
Just use consumables and max your dps.
---
Ah, didn't realize it was a joke. Should probably stay off this sub, so damn toxic :c
---
While some people with pre existing issues have no doubt over done it on WoW, I feel a far more serious issue with gaming is loot boxes and the malicious practices they use. Perhaps this is not so for you, dear reader, perhaps you can handle it - the target audience however, the so called ‚Äúwhales‚Äù, which are people with compulsion disorders, cannot. Some spend thousands of dollars, money they often don‚Äôt have, because the systems in the game are constructed to psychologically abuse their compulsion issues. 
---
It is a perfectly fine thing to spend a lot of time on a hobby. Long as you enjoy it, that should be your business - no different than any other hobby in history. The reason for the stigma? Because it‚Äôs the newest kid on the block. People have gone fishing for centuries. Car enthusiast have been around for lifetimes. Gaming is new, and like all things new, misunderstood and abused. For one thing the movie industry has (rightfully so even) felt threatened by the gaming industry and thus aided in the spread of such stigmas. Hasn‚Äôt worked, gaming is a far bigger industry now.
---
With this in mind, what is wow? A social game that, get this, people enjoy - enjoy enough to spend a lot of time on. True, some need help managing themselves, but not because of something the game does to them. The science is clear on this: gaming does not cause addiction. Gaming can be a host for an underlying, pre-existing condition, but it cannot create one. I wrote a semester special on as much for uni once after learning about the cognitive mechanics involved in ludomania and addiction. Misinformation about this is sadly more rampant than ever, and imo that likely causes more stress and issues than any real issue WoW and likeminded games do. Play it to whatever extend you‚Äôd like to and have time for, but do so without all these stigmas eating into your enjoyment
---
Same... somehow 300 games going on and still 5-10min wait
---
From my understanding you can go up to max rank in a week. Not likely but it is possible. You could also go from top to bottom in one week, but only due to dishonorable kills. The regular decay would not do that fast enough.
---
Here is a very thorough guide about all things honor and PVP.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview
---
Where do you get the models to do something like this?
---
I don't think he means literally every item drops off every boss, just rearrange all the tables so every dungeon has a few items for every role rather than each role being heavily skewed into one dungeon.
---
People just want to get the game over as quickly as possible so they can straight into the next match.  This method will net you the most rep in the long run. I'd rather lose every game at 6-7 minutes than win most games at 15-20 minutes.
---
I don't think they were in BC. You just got more currency with better rank
---
I was excited about the shutdown. Since the patch there's been a 3 hour queue every night to play so playing after work is not common. Luckily the servers went down and I was able to get in when they came back up and play for a few hours.
---
Which is really kind of sad. It makes games so much more stressful to play with efficiency and min/max on the brain at all times. I started to fall into that trap with Stardew Valley of all things. Got on their sub and felt like I was doing a shitty job because I didn't have 1 million gold at the end of the first year, wasn't married, didn't have the community center finished, and my skills weren't maxed.    
---
I left the sub, and started enjoying the game so much more. Just winging it. No guides, no suggestions, no expectations.   
---
A friend of mine tried introducing me to simming characters in retail WoW a year ago, and I instantly wanted no part of it. I just play the way I play and do what feels good/fun, and it's so much more enjoyable. I was never the best player, but I was in the top 50 for tanks on m+ scoring on a high pop server until I quit.  
---
I wish people would just do what's enjoyable. Not everyone has time to be at the top of honor ranks in a system that rewards time spent online over everything else.
---
Agreed, all of the PvE-PvP sort of zones they've made have always been awful in my mind. Just something to knock out every week. It doesn't appeal to PvP'ers because its rarely actual PvP and it doesn't appeal to PvE players because its so easy.
---
&gt; acting like MC is a free clear for anyone reaching 60 is just bullshit.
---
I don't think anyone's saying that it's "free," just that it can be done (and so you aren't "behind"). You do have to find a solid group of players to run with, but you don't have to do a bunch of gearing up. 60s in random blues and greens can clear Rag just fine, provided they have a main tank with some decent FR.
---
Yeah man, jokes are super toxic. Best you stay away. Humor can be hurtful!
---
Don't waste your breath :p
---
Now just allow that LFG addon again
---
Then play WSG, or, I dunno....g o T o RE T a IL
---
You have to play on a PvP server otherwise it‚Äôs too easy
---
Eehhh, in 40 man instances you're not exactly able to make a game impacting difference by yourself.
---
why is this downvoted?
---
It's not partially true, it's actually true, the current meeting stones in classic are wrong, the group queue system was originally there and it's missing.
---
On Stallagg we do have a casual guild. the slight issue is that GM is PST and heavily does recruiting in the beginning so a lot of people are PST and I am EST with odd playtimes (working from home somedays or just before primetime as im a semi early sleeper). 
---
If youre on stallagg and horde lemme know! I actually was so far behind the curve for p2 that I am just about to hit 48. Couldnt have timed it better.
---
It's pretty interesting - yesterday I saw a shift in horde from going right to van at the beginning and by the end of the night horde stopped going right to band and started to do all the other objectives for Honor. Horde didn't win a single game but left every match with 3k honor
---
Good luck explaining it to your PUG raid every time. So far people have issues not to jump Balinda with 30 ppl but that's completely fine.
---
P2 resulted in a huge loss of interest for me too.
---
If you want to keep playing you need to really focus on what **you** want out of the game. If you aren't taking the time to consider what you want, you'll just get swept up in doing what most of the community is doing. Which IMO is pretty fucking boring.
---
If you can focus on achieving the goals you set for yourself, the game can still be a lot of fun.
---
Unfortunately, AV basically doesn't exist IMO.
---
Go take your pet out and walk into searing gorge from kargath (or wherever, I just figured that was most convenient) and watch it just stand still for a bit at the zone border before teleporting back up to you
---
Better yet, go join a group and do the same thing with 5~10+ other people and watch them stand still at the zone border for several seconds before teleporting forward and phasing.
---
That behavior is identical in function to how it happens when you move between shards in retail or when you moved between layers before they were condensed back into 1.
---
Game design drives player behavior. Older versions drive people to capture the least amount of objectives needed to win while also encouraging people to kill each other to slow the enemy down. The rush was inevitable, but this version has the least amount of objectives required to win while also not requiring enemies to share a space.
---
&gt; They don't care about classic.
---
Having worked in the games industry, I'd bet that it's worse than that. Someone high up at Blizzard probably spent years arguing that players don't really want Classic, and modern WoW is better. That same person is going to want Classic to fail because if it succeeds that would reflect poorly on them.
---
Or maybe I'm just jaded, but there's a *lot* of egos in game development.
---
I hate the boss rush but I also hate horde that cap sfgy, because that turns a 5-10 minute game into 20m+ and that's much less fun in the grand scheme.
---
That's what im saying - past exalted there's no reason (right now) for ally to do AV leading to long queue times for horde. Like, this isn't a sustainable system
---
I've also won every game I've played thus far as horde where you can wipe the initial zerg.
---
Issue is it can take anywhere from 15~40 minutes instead of 6~10 minutes.
---
I lold
---
theres ways around that...i have grouped AV before TBC came out in vanilla.
---
&gt;First, if you're going to make such a claim, you had better have a source.
---
Sure, during Wrath there were 90k 3v3 players. At that time, there were millions of players. Even if we only stuck to the US playerbase, thats going to be less than 5%.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/2966516750
---
He's not wrong about everything, just that. I loathe the shorter render distance too. It's awful and definitely not Vanilla.
---
&gt; though I desperately wish that was the truth
---
I don't. Not because I want Classic to fail. But because Activision-corporate would see that and go "we need to monetize that 'revenue channel'".
---
See now, I'm not sure if it was truly fueled by money. Because if it was, why didn't they tack on an extra $5/mo fee to play 'Classic'. Plus, again, if it was...why didn't they setup the store? They could have put the CE and 'Year One' Blizzcon ingame pets in it; $15 a pop.
---
...or, since they were going for 1.12, put the old 100% mounts that had no armor in for like $2 a pop.
---
Has the best pvp caster ring though??
---
don't forget the third button.
---
"a community that has too much information and research available to ever get the the true feeling of classic back, along with a community that can't figure out whether to focus on min-maxing or actual gameplay and thus will clash hard and constantly"
---
Who cares about honor?  99% of people won't see ranks beyond rank 10.  People want Rep and Ally definitely get the better end of that deal by winning.
---
blizzard is left..
---
I (tank) position myself in the doorway to one of the sides, blocking line of sight from the main entrance. The range positions themselves so they can engage anyone that engages me at melee range. If I get attacked, I pull back a bit to aggro the guards. If I have a healer, they stay against the wall and out of line of sight completely.
---
The guards aggroing combined with the range dumping on melee normally is enough to take out a few and ruin their push.
---
The last few levels were actually the fastest for me. I think I spent 6hrs on each level, and I am a warrior solo. Just quest if you want to get to 60 the fastest as possible. In before ‚ÄúBUT WPVP‚Äù, I leveled in a PVP server. Strat is also insane xp to break up the questing grind. It‚Äôs helpful to get your pre-raid BIS items and attunements before level 60, but not required.
---
We've had slightly different experiences, and very different goals.
---
Ally won over 80% of games I played yesterday.  When we zerged Drek we won over 90% of the time.  When it turned into a turtle it was 50/50.
---
The Ally POV is most of us just want the rep, that should be obvious from the meta strategy you've seen.
---
Looks like he might have sent you an IP logger link in an attempt to hit you offline.
---
I bet it will be very fun when most Naxx bosses die in 2 mins or less because half of them (such as Anub, Faerlina, Maexxna, Noth, Gluth, etc.) have 1.5m HP or less while each DPS can easily pull 800+ DPS with AQ gear and consumables (even before factoring wbuffs into the mix).
---
At least TBC DPS races/checks were real, not just a joke where the boss has a 7 min enrage timer but dies in less than half that time (I'm looking at you, Patchwerk).
---
I thought it was the priest thing. Becoming invulnerable kinda breaks the game lol.
---
That's simply not true. If this was 1.12 we'd have naxx, AB, ST class quests, different loot tables, and dozen other things.
---
Here, I'll complain: The horde are acting like cowards for a few items. Spineless and weak, they give away wins. It's pathetic.
---
Noob or not, its a matter of how much you lay attention and min/max what you got. 
---
It may req you farm BRD for some specifc healing items and gearing the tank out to take an ass beating while you OOM/Pot back. 
---
Use the pali and have him judge seal of light to help heal the group as you wack the boss dead!
---
Again, you will need a little more gear than the avg 5man but nothing that cant be farmed or made between the 4 of you.
---
Also add the following:
---
dead
---
ruined
---
killed
---
blizzard
---
Yea I hate corpse campers in BGs
---
Did you consider using a pvp trinket? Or perhaps a shadow reflector?
---
No u
---
And 4 drunk members of the opposite sex (or same sex if that floats your boat.)
---
#metoo disclaimer - always get consent
---
I dont think ZG release will get as much whining, but maybe folks will complain about the corrupted blood thing.
---
Try using disc/Skype count down and click at the same time,I did it last night for about 5 avs and only had to drop que once.
---
It‚Äôs certainly a category-by-category kind of thing. In the case of PvP rewards, they just gave us everything.
---
Maybe not an addiction, but it is a very powerful distraction that many find irresistible. I had issues with procrastination through most of my life, and was stuck in low-pay dead end jobs up through my 20s because of it. One of the biggest changes in my life was when my gaming computer died and I replaced it with a shitty iMac that could barely play anything while also being very focused on not playing games for a few years.
---
Being adept in something with a low skill floor does not speak to a player's capabilities. 
---
If you want to say someone is "really good" at farming AV mindlessly, sure, but that doesn't indicate anything about their skill in other PvP avenues. It barely indicates anything of their skill in that avenue itself. 
---
In LoL it was something like top 1% of the population was Gold 3. I wouldn't call anybody in that area really good, but by your definition they would be. We just have different standards, I choose not to let my comparison to unskilled individuals be what defines my skill. 
---
Regardless, I fail to see how you have shown that being R14 in AV farm meta indicates anything of skill, and I'll even demonstrate on my end how it doesn't. I've been farming AV for ~8 hours so far, the entire BG is done in 2 pulls. If you aren't a tank there's not even anything for you to do except hit your mobs. If you are a tank there's 1 pull that you have to know, that's it. The skill floor is demonstrably low as virtually no communication in game is required and game length is sub 8 minutes, most of which is just running to the bases. Nothing in this meta indicates skill, at most it would be a good mage learning to nova in the right spots or a hunter leaving a trap in a commonly traveled area to slow down the enemy team. That's the peak of the skill cap in this meta, none of which speaks to player's execution/coordination skills. 
---
Please tell me how excelling in this avenue indicates you are skilled (Without comparing to an average player)
---
Everyone seems excited about the ring. But I believe it's mostly a pvp ring.
---
oh my gosh. this guy below you responded to every single post with a negative idea of twinks.
---
Nochanges wanted 1.5 or 1.8 AV they were extremely vocal about this when it was announced. Private servers don't use 1.12 AV. The lack of knowledge in this thread...
---
/r/nocontext 
---
Funny story about twinking out of context, I once googled "69 twinks" on my work computer.
---
I don't think my heart has stopped for that long in my entire life.
---
You misspelled outnumbered in referring to players.
---
Oasis? Isn't that another MMO?
---
And you're so insecure you have to come to reddit to complain about him..
---
People don't like the shared cities because "It removes the idea of separate factions".  People bitch about this all the time.
---
Daily quests just furthered the game down one of the things I actually don't like, which was making it about logging in and doing your quests each day instead of how/when you wanted to do it.  It's the mobile game style that culminated in WoD.
---
What people bitch about with flying mounts is that it makes huge amounts of the game pointless.  You aren't really in a world anymore, you are flying above it, only descending to specifically do the thing you want and then fly off.
---
The unintuitive system with TBC raiding was that it starts with a 10m leading into 2 short 25m raids.  Gruul's Lair and Magtheridon have to then be completed to make it into SSC/TK.  You basically would have to split a raid into 3 groups to do karazhan for gear to then combine the raid to go do Mag/Gruul.  Mag and Gruul were a lot more difficult of a step than normal entry level raids.  Due to how short their raids were, Kara was the only place to really get gear.  Once you did them people move to Hyjal and then BT/Sunwell.  THe problem was trying to attune people who may have joined the guild later.  A guild would have to go back and do TK/SSC to get people into Hyjal.  What's funny is that Hyjal and most of BT were honestly quite a bit easier than SSC/TK.  Once the attunements were removed, Hyjal was done by guilds were struggled with Gruul/Mag and couldn't previously even get into SSC/TK.
---
&gt;I don't see why we're blaming TBC for things that ruined the game AFTER TBC.
---
When BC introduced mechanics which facilitated the evolution of the game, then yes it is BC's fault.  Arenas were largely so imbalanced most of the time they suffered greatly even during BC.  You could pretty easily pick a bracket and know what kind of team would dominate it.  Trying to balance arenas with PvE would lead to a problem which lasted as least until I quit WoW during pandaria.
---
Yes they were
---
Most people are just doing AV for rep, and rushing drek is the best way to farm it. Honor is an afterthought to anyone who isn't actively grinding rank.
---
It's objectively more complex than lower levels.
---
Seconding this. Mageweave is fairly pricey on my server and this is still good xp til about 49.
---
/salute
---
I have 90% wr, im speaking about what happens WHEN they lose. I know reading is hard.
---
You can have a 60 kill everything in the dungeon and you still get pretty solid XP.  Just sit at the entrance.  I lvld my alt to 60 super fast just paying for runs then gorshak farming the last bit
---
Dragsonscale gives Red Dragonscale Breastplate which is Bis for Healer Shaman.  
---
Tribal gives Hide Of The Wild which is Bis for Healer Shaman &amp; Druids.
---
Hint hint..these people didn‚Äôt play, were super young, or are falsely remembering old AV.
---
Most Games even before 1.12 were super quick, a little longer than they are now but still were quick. People knew even then the best strategy was to Zerg.
---
Did the occasional long AV happen? Yes and it can still happen if people turtle.
---
But people forget that AV was almost universally hated and people bitched every patch in vanilla. There is a reason it was changed so much in vanilla lifetime... and anyone that says that was universally loved like they pretend on this subreddit is flat out lying.
---
But I am fine with the current state of classic though.
---
How much honor did you get last week?
---
Yes, cross realm BGs were added with patch 1.12, which is the patch classic is based on.
---
This community is hindsight 20/20.
---
.... but you want your desired playstyle to dictate how I play the game. Right?
---
lol right? 
---
50% of the time when I do die, I watch them die from my DoTs before rezzing. It's so satisfying!
---
&gt;*youre wasting time if you dont afk out*
---
Seriously... Who wants to play games *for fun*. Jeez, the nerve of some people...
---
its not 1.5 av on retail
---
SImilar .. yes
---
but its a heavily modified 1.5
---
Or, just maybe, I don‚Äôt actually care?
---
&gt;Implying only [nationality] act like assholes
---
idk mn I got stuck in a 45 min WSG last night and wanted to kill myself. It just gets so boring.
---
Well I have 90% wr so I think im fine. Im just speaking out on what happens and what it takes to lose... Is it that hard to read lmao. Idk why I have 2 replies with, "Uuh no, u" lol
---
guess i coulda fixed that, huh? hehe
---
How much gold is a reasonable price for rebuilding a city?
---
Hey my welfare epics cost a couple hundred gold there buddy. Can't be no broke boy with tuf/julios
---
You hate the game so you continue to come to a forum dedicated to the game?
---
Use a DBM or big wigs /pull timer or just /timer  to do it.
---
That will better set up you against discord lag
---
I think your just making a strawman. He literally said better to quit now than to expect blizzard to cater to your personal whims. What in that statement is false?nothing. Now your oppinion is his statement is shitty because of its bluntness. OP doesn‚Äôt say anything about OP not being welcome in the community it just points out blizzard doesn‚Äôt care about OP.
---
Oh hey, gratz! Luckily all my guildies got back on in time too to dodge the queues, ended up being completely okay! I feel for the people who went to the bathroom and got stuck in the queue though
---
who say no changes are not the most smart bunch. Its classic wow, not wow vanilla, you cannot go back in time, if it was possible the wow develop team would just go with a pserver base and fix that shit up, and not use a new version.  
---
WoW Classic needs changes because people have access to a lot of info and are likely to abuse everything they can.
---
3 lvl 60s and 1 lvl 40.. bruh go take a shower
---
You shut off your CPU?
---
&gt;The entire system is against you if you are even remotely casual. Its why we got arena.
---
TO be fair, that's certainly not the only reason.  I've enjoyed several aspects of the game, and BGs are fun for the grand objective, but small arena skirmishes are fun to test your skill.
---
Spirit of  classic all the way. Slam the button.
---
That wasn‚Äôt a ted talk, that was a rant
---
Blizzard is most responsible for changes.
---
Also, some changes are pretty damn reasonable and in-line with the spirit of Classic.
---
I agree.  PvP was never meant to be a main pillar of WoW, just a fun distraction.  If I want to really compete at something, I'm going to be playing a different game entirely.
---
Didn't realize the US was a centrally planned economy.
---
I'd say that the vast majority of people aren't playing for honor at this point. Even if they were, honor between the factions is completely meaningless since you only compete with your own faction.
---
The mindset that I've observed from my fellow Alliance is that those who understand how the game systems work don't care about the bonus honor totals. The quick wins  make the rep grind 3x faster than it would be by accepting losses in lieu of additional honor.
---
I've got three characters to exalt, so I'm good with the status quo.
---
Nah retail
---
&gt;If you want to say someone is "really good" at farming AV mindlessly, sure, but that doesn't indicate anything about their skill in other PvP avenues. It barely indicates anything of their skill in that avenue itself.
---
No one is saying that it does. The argument was whether or not r14s were good players or not. Yes, a lot of it is farming AV and farming AV does not a good player make. But the vast majority of people who play WoW for hours and hours a day are still, "really good" at WoW. You can make the argument that they aren't the very best, based on whatever metric you like, but that was never the argument.
---
Or we don't care about pvp or your weird rp ethos.
---
200g, you'd have to respec both ways.
---
I Enjoy bfa very much :)
---
Pretty sure that's why people think removing this one specific item seems strange and inconsistent.
---
So much this, I hate the current need for everything to happen at once. Just immerse yourself and HAVE FUN, rushing constantly for everything can't be fun.
---
I took one on purpose last night to respec arms. It was very convenient.
---
Misread the guild as 'Strictly Bananas' and now I'm disappointed
---
Pretty much. I join and fish if I'm working.
---
&gt; It's also literally just a ton of shitty players on rogues trying to 1 shot ungeared players. 
---
As someone who started out in that bracket, Its funny the image rogues get in that bracket as the dominators.
---
I always get a good laugh when a 19 rogue twink meets a 19 hunter twink.
---
Things I like most about about Classic:
---
Challenging leveling, that causes to form a good bond with the characters traits, and a greater form of achievement
---
Things I miss most in Classic:
---
Quest finder
---
IT WAS ALWAYS A ZERG FEST. Even by 3/4 of the way through vanilla people knew the optimal strategy was to Zerg. The only time it became a long game was when people did nothing or turtles up... even now you can do it.
---
Getting to 1750 (least that's what I remember getting my hunter to for the helm) really isn't that hard. I ran hunter/resto druid and facerolled a few arenas a week for like a month before I had enough points for the item. It takes a little effort but it's not hard.
---
No go back to retail if you want to be anti social and not talk to anyone. Fuck off
---
This mindset is what is causing most of the complaints right now.
---
Which class would you recommend?
---
Truefaith is stronger than any dungeon piece. T1 is better for PvP, plus I use it when int is better than +healing (dispel-heavy bosses). T2 might be better, especially with set bonus.
---
Gonna hit that disagree button. I am fully raid geared and thoroughly enjoy melting faces in the 60's bracket. I also enjoy twinking and melting faces in the lower brackets as well.
---
The point is, gearing up and melting people is fun.
---
Anyone else notice all these toons are server names?
---
1.5 was the 2nd version of AV if i recall
---
average was 1hr or so for a completed match?
---
your thinking of the AV that had lotus spawns in FoS, and Korrak in the center of the field 
---
1.5 he was moved to central GY no one caps....
---
Enjoy the reports for griefing, then.
---
I have had similar scuffed fights against him.  The last time our "leatherman" warrior off-tank died instantly from a crit to the add he was tanking while a mage kited Drak.  I became the new off-tank for Drak when conflag was on the main.  I am a resto shaman, but was luckily in all mail gear and using a shield so we made it through.
---
GDKP is where it‚Äôs at
---
They've made European servers worse for 20 years or so.
---
They gave us everything in terms of loot/stat changes ... *except these rep rewards*. It's the first case of them withholding item changes , and in this case it appears to be arbitrary &amp; illogical.
---
Right now WSG is all premades which makes it worst for pugs, AV will be the BG of choice for the next few months
---
Ahhh, I've heard a lot of good things about JoJo's but i've never gotten around to watching it.
---
well thats the whole point.... you make the sacrifice to do rep grind, you get rewarded with better gear
---
I was in a Korrak's revenge on Tuesday where the Alliance had like 12 hunters in it, causing the Horde to turtle in their base.  Game took 2 hours, and there were people in it with over 1000 HK's by the end.
---
People were complaining about how long the game was taking, and actually trying to convince people to let the horde cap a few GY's to get them out of the base.  I on the other hand was having a blast mowing down Horde with Rapid Fire and barrage.  Didn't want it to end.
---
thank you.
---
Good job mods, thanks.
---
No I don't care how you play the game. If I don't like AV I won't play it, if I have to do a grind to get a reward I want I'll do it.
---
I'm not sitting here saying the game should be X way because it's best for me, like you are.
---
Same as the other people saying they want 1.5 AV because it's better for them.
---
Get over yourselves, it's a fucking game. If part of it isn't fun then don't play it. Vote with your money, because it's clear that's what Blizzard cares about but you idiots are all to addicted to this fantasy of "classic" that you won't.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, the mount won‚Äôt be released for awhile
---
always loosing in 5min &gt; winning in 8min.
---
Thank the gods for battlegrounds!
---
Hyperinflation. Salt is so abundant it's not worth anything, and we keep raising the minimum salt levels thus crashing the market even worse.
---
why is it that alliance can end it early but horde cant? Not familiar with the actual BG
---
Private server players call them ‚Äúpservers‚Äù and always talk about ‚Äúthere was once lotus‚Äù in AV....
---
So I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre one of those people.
---
39 enhancement shaman all the way. Hard part is getting your hands on a Pendulum of Doom. Usually forced to settle for Staff of Jordan.
---
&gt;Lol that's rich, twinks specifically target non-twinks in bgs because one shotting people gives them a power trip.
---
Why would they do that? Twinks almost always hunt the other twinks in the battleground. Its a rivalry.
---
Unless you're coordinating to farm HKs with the other factions' twinks, twink v twink is the majority of the gameplay.
---
Pitbull Unit Frames is broke and won't even load any longer, Questie broken, Prat broken, Bagnon works but won't show keyring
---
Dude you better get off reddit with your reasonable opinions and good intentions.   They don't take kindly to your type around here.
---
According to reddit, literally everyone wanted gigantic megaservers.
---
Also nothing is ever blizzards fault and why do you keep blaming Blizzard for your poor choices /s
---
&gt;  the awful 3 day long per game version
---
you misspelled awesome
---
In my limited experience, I'm making a killing with the Fishing/Cooking/Alchemy triad. Like, mathematically, my fishing grind would be something like 20-30gph just selling the stuff but I turn it all into food and potions and it ends up closer to 40-50gph while watching Netflix. Lol.
---
3-5 minutes right now for me, but it's around noon EST so not prime time hours.
---
having just spent 600g to rep up darnassus rep (I am a gnome) and 900g for the sabre I'm hope its more than 10g lol
---
qUe IsN‚Äôt A vAliD aBbReViAtIoN
---
I agree.
---
How dare they!
---
I sympathize. You just found the darkweb. Now you just want to tell everyone about how you enjoy molesting small animals and spamming the n word in trade chat #nochanges. It isn‚Äôt that internet anymore. 15 years to late.
---
People always want that AV rep. Its an easy grind compared to other reps.
---
"competitive" is extremely vague, 500k could be enough depending on what rank you actually aim for
---
I‚Äôm guessing 1 million. Not even kidding
---
&gt; my guess is that you are falling for the emote "
---
&gt; /e has reported you as AFK. To remove this, type /Afk Deny or you will be removed from this battleground in 30 seconds"
---
&gt; If it is, stop typing /afk deny. It only registers the /afk part and will auto remove you. It is not that easy to remove someone from av. I have seen bots that i have spam reported that dont get removed.
---
- u/The_Fapmonsoon
---
Seriously, even 1k honor which is like minimum for a 5 min game will ALWAYS beat spending hours ganking folks for maybe 100 honor a kill.
---
Red is dead.
---
It‚Äôs like revenge of the nerds. It‚Äôs like all the kids that were picked on during vanilla want to come back to classic and be the bullies and act like they know everything inside and out
---
I can tell you have never played anything competitively. Sure it is funny to one shot someone, but that is boring. Stop playing victim and thinking everyone has malicious intent. Twinks would prefer full twink WSG over a mixed match.
---
&gt; They have been saying this entire time that, at least initially, they're implementing everything exactly how it was in 1.12, "warts and all".
---
Except for the rewards. The rewards are from 1.6. They are full of shit.
---
You completely misunderstood that
---
Exactly!  It's not that I think Classic was a perfect game, it's just that I think retail now sucks.  I know the flaws in Classic and I still had a ton of fun (and am having fun still).  I'm personally in the Classic+ camp, but that's a pipe dream and we know it.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve
---
&gt;You literally just said the argument is whether or not R14 was really good, i.e. skilled at the game.
---
And I stand by it. Most people who reached R14 were really good at the game. You people then decided to make up these fictitious people who mindlessly ran AV for 15 hours a day every day and did nothing else who were bad at the game. But people who play WoW 15 hours a day do tend to be better at WoW than people who don't. 
---
&gt; All R14 can tell you is that someone has more time than others. 
---
I agree that reaching R14 takes more time than any socially acceptable person could possibly spend. But with time and dedication comes skill in almost all cases. Whether it's WoW or carpentry.
---
Doesn't matter for alliance if they don't make as much honor as horde does because they're not competing against horde.
---
&gt; Horde can win if they defend and turtle the game.
---
How? They have to push forward eventually.
---
It was, but it was one of the more controversial changes (that were good). It's just harder for premades to fight premades now.
---
Oh STFU I was clearly joking
---
Play WSG... problem solved
---
What makes whisping 15 different player for an inv such a social element? 
---
People talked more during dungeons because it took way longer and it wasn‚Äôt 5 heirloom geared players zergin through a dung in a couple of minutes..
---
DR in general would be nice. I play a mage and can only imagine someones frustration when i sheep them for a minute straight.
---
Rank 14 to get the weapons is what i'm going for
---
yes but factor in a premade as alliance.... you win 3-4 mins almost 90% of the time
---
This is a retail player opinion.
---
Probably about 3% dps since you'd need to make up the 3% hit on gear instead of other stats.
---
All locks should be hard tailoring for ph3 anyways dude. Bloodvine. Set only works if you are a tailor.
---
DKP management and or swaying the LC with performance man. Is there a classic armory? I'm like 4th on prior and got all but rings... items in mc are easy to farm. Most average guilds clear it in 1-2hours. Let alone the speedrunners... Theres pugs for MC on dead servers mate...
---
Terrible. Debatable. Prio should be mages on it, but very easilly attainable..
---
no it wouldn't
---
I'm willing to entertain a realm-specific Group Finder but it's really a long shot and the potential impact will be uncertain.
---
Dual spec is def something I wish for though. At this point I'd rather flask (70-80g on my server) than spending 100g to respec twice just to ensure I have enough damage output for raid.
---
Bro I tried keeping up with wow for the last 2 months. I walk 12 mi a day avg  for work on feet 9-10 hrs. Not the sitting type of job. Would play wow for 6-8 hrs a day and sleep for 4hr. That was my day from launch till about 2 weeks ago. Had to quit for my health and self motivation.
---
Ignore all of the objectives, ignore the towers, ignore everything and just have the whole raid rush directly to the opposing team's boss.  Pull the warmasters out and reset the boss, kill the warmasters, kill the boss by himself.  Whole round takes about 5-8 minutes tops.
---
AV favors the Alliance due to the terrain differences.
---
I don't know if you can filter by username, but you can add me to your ignore list if you want. I'm fine with that, it's your reddit too, you should be able to browse like you want...
---
mostly likely, every game I have had that extended past 10 minutes was a Horde win.
---
Did they learn from their mistake? Are we talking about some hypothetical newbie that just compulsively clicks portals and hasn't been able to do an AV yet because of the incessant griefing he can't help but find himself on the victim's end?
---
If you asked a genuine question, and I said Alt-F4, and you closed out your WoW, I wasted your time and I'm preying on those that know less than me for a laugh, but nobody gives a fuck. Sen-si-tive.
---
Russians are the good WoW PvP players.
---
&gt; Twinks spent tons of gold and time to perfect characters to compete not against levellers but against other twinks.
---
If you actually believe anything but a tiny minority of twinks is like this, I've got a nice bridge to sell you.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds makes average honor gain from rushing higher and doesn't reward balanced populations. 
---
If it was your server only, the larger faction would need to queue, and as DR is daily, ten minute battlegrounds would rapidly face diminishing returns from kills. So, while BGs are fun, the changes are not all good.
---
Alright, with these replies I'm definitely going to give it a shot. When looking it up on Wowhead, it says that it has an 8% drop rate from Dathrohan, and a 3% drop rate from Balnazzar. Isn't Dathrohan the dude in strat live that turns into Balnazzar? If so which drop rate is correct?
---
Just an all nighter no biggie babe
---
Because there are thousands of players you see daily at 60.
---
Its harder to make a community when everyone is a new face in a giant mass of faces.
---
Sure I play on a TBC server from time to time and did leave classic for a while, but came back with the addition of battlegrounds. You also have a very dishonest and over dramatic way of putting things. All I'd said was I was playing on a different server and suggested they try it out in the meantime, lol
---
Im a stay at home dad and my 7 month old sits on my lap while I play, shes been ripping the keys off my keyboard while im trying to grind that sweet honor, got her a light up play keyboard for xmas, time to learn them keybinds!!!
---
Living the dream over here!
---
What's your goal?
---
The honor needed will change based on how active your realm is in PvP, how many players are going for the top spots, how high the ranks you personally want to climb, and how soon you want to get there.
---
The main post explains why people are getting kicked lol. Did you just go into a random post on the subreddit and scroll past the OP?
---
Play if it's something you're interested in trying out. 
---
You can queue on your own, so it's not something that you will *need* to get a premade group for, and while you can be hardcore and smash through BGs, you don't have to be to play them. 
---
Go play if you feel like you're missing out, give it 10 games, and see if you still feel that way.
---
Yeah, sucks for those people but I'm also happy about the ones that instantly came to Reddit to cry about the server going down not getting back in.
---
People are ranking right now. You literally lose 20% of your progress every week and the slower you go the more you have to play to keep up
---
 You can do whatever you want after you reach your rank.
---
Is there any reason for a healing priest not to bubble a paladin tank? Like obviously warriors and bears wanna get hit to generate rage but so paladins have any reason to need to be hit
---
I am thinking of starting an alt. I think I want it to be a healer, but my question is this: how miserable is solo play as a maxed level/spec healer? I am a pretty casual player, so I don't want to be miserable everywhere except PvE content.
---
the horde send a pack for the slow mounts. Pour one out for them
---
The BGs themselves weren't supposed to be released until P3 either, Blizz upped the timetable.  Likely mods like Atlasloot are not updated to reflect the current changes yet.
---
That's my most hated element of retail. I like that you have to do all those things and if group finders appeared thatd be the end of classic for me.
---
I sincerely hope the devs never ever ever listen to the community.
---
I believe it‚Äôs actually a tiny bit cheaper if memory serves me right. For horde it‚Äôs a pretty cool and I‚Äôd save for it but Alliance I wouldn‚Äôt bother but that‚Äôs my opinion
---
If stacking resilience and pillar humping it the meter of wow skill then I am happy to be complete shit at wow.
---
People do occasionally gripe about those sorts of bugs, which classic also has. I would like to be immune to mana drain in forms again. That'd be awesome.
---
Benediction and Mage
---
Seems you could until the hotfix, which led to some pretty short WSG matches.
---
cringy.
---
&gt; The reason you knew everyone in TBC/Wrath still is because you knew everyone in vanilla, and that simply persisted until the members of the vanilla community started quitting en masse.
---
That's a huge assumption and untrue.  In fact, I joined my long term guild in BC and made most of those friends (and enemies) on both sides in BC and Wrath.  Not vanilla.  You're basing your assumptions on your own personal experience which just isn't right.  I'm not saying your experience isn't what happened to some people.  But CRBG had no such effect for me.  Because in the end everyone on your server was in Shattrath in BC and everyone in your server was in Dalaran in Wrath.  Those cities were where we spent all our time when we weren't raiding or questing.  Those were the primary reasons why we knew everyone on server.
---
AV is for Rep and PvE items that come from Rep. 
---
Honor is just a side bonus every 7 minutes
---
While I agree with this in part, I‚Äôd add to it. I‚Äôm in a casual/hardcore guild that clears MC and Ony same night within 2.5 hours usually. When people leave, yeah some people get sour about it, but you can leave on good terms as many members have. But like this guy said, if you‚Äôre a main tank who has been getting gear or a top healer, people will be sour as fuck about it. Now if you say you‚Äôre leaving because you can‚Äôt make raid nights due to schedule, that usually is pretty understandable.
---
This AV is the most garbage 40v40/mmo skirmish event i have ever seen. 
---
Most of AV games in vanilla were tens of hours/days long. Because people had to work together to achieve goals like capturing towers or holding choke points. 
---
Now? 5min games with 1-5 deaths. Exalted in 1 day. Strategically pumping out games to farm honor.  
---
Glad my sub ran out. Making my choice to move on to other games easier, esp when xmas deals are coming up. Not much hope left in this game.
---
I am feeling the same way. Bonus if the games slow to a crawl after I hit exalted. The rep is good now but its not really fun.
---
My first 3-4 games my only goal was to get the flag from the cave (Horde) before the game ended. I finally was able to because a warrior and mage were also doing it. I couldn't clear to it fast enough on my own. I did have a few longer games thrown in, with zerg v zerg for periods of time but never too long. Those were fun, albeit rare.
---
Great community btw
---
Nost was trash. It wasn‚Äôt vanilla. Blizzard had some sort of progression type server in the pipes for years. You think the company that copies what other people do didn‚Äôt notice what other games had been doing before your little hive of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too poor and antisocial to play real MMOs‚Äù got squashed? Nost wasn‚Äôt even good. Project 1999 was probably more of a model of what they were looking at. You private server clowns are so unbelievably self important.
---
What is asmongold...
---
Yeah Kevin Jordan talked how he was basically playing catch up on making all specs viable. They finally got to cover most the major problems by WotLK
---
I think elemental sharpening stone would work. It can be applied to all melee weapons to my knowledge (I've tested it on the Hand of Rag, a blunt weapon, and it was still successfully applied), so I don't see why it wouldn't work for a druid.
---
Try Korraks revenge in retail. It‚Äôs just a Zerg, even with the lieutenants and land mines and whatnot.
---
Only way to fix the issue is to only award honor to the winner, and that would be a pretty large change.
---
On my server there aren't enough tanks to even have stereotypes about!
---
Herbalism
---
Don't have this issue, but glad you figured it out for yourself.
---
At first I would've been inclined to agree with you. I think for an MMORPG, dedication-based systems should be what is used. A lot of modern skill-based ranking systems just breed toxicity in their games because they just kick you in the balls every time you lose a game, especially when teams aren't on equal footing in terms of balance and outcomes of ranked games are out of your control due to teammates (LoL and Overwatch are perfect examples of this). This type of system should never have been used for WoW, especially for such an imbalanced gamemode.
---
But now that I've gone through Phase 2 and have witnessed the beginning of Phase 2.5, I'd take the TBC system over what we have now in a heartbest, because for the TBC system *at least its toxicity is contained within arenas.* The Rank 14 system affects every aspect of the world if you're on a PvP server: farming in the open world, trying to get into dungeons, planning raids, and of course BGs. But it always does so in the worst way possible, promoting toxic, unhealthy means of play that haven't been seen to such a massive scale outside of private servers. People use and abuse Goblin Sapper Charges to decimate raid groups and throw raids way off schedule. Both the 1v1 fights and the 40v40 world battles that people play on PvP servers to do simply don't exist anymore, instead being replaced with gank squads that decimate anyone not actively participating in the honor grind. People don't do BGs anymore to have fun; instead, they just zerg AV to be 7 minutes rather than the 7 hour matches those very same people romanticized. They build premades for WSG to pubstomp random groups, and exploit the game to avoid premades that can actually compete with them. 
---
It's hell, and I really wish the Rank 14 system didn't have to be this way. I wish it could be a great, flavorful dedication-based honor system that embodies the spirit of what we love about Classic, but right now it embodies everything we hate about it.
---
Trying to get my wife to realize this truth. But she's like "But i already have a 60 and epic mount blah blah blah..." great - in the meanwhile I refuse to play the game cause of how toxic PVP servers are.
---
For me grinding gear is fun
---
You're missing the point. There's no time gate on getting into basketball beyond your own capability of playing basketball. Yeah, putting in lots of time can help you be better, but at the end of the day you're going to be measured for your skill with the game, not your time sunk.
---
A full geared twink can take a day to gear, so twink vs twink is fairly equal. At 60 the gear differential has a much larger range, this was why the tournament servers were put into place on retail so that everyone can be an an equal playing field.
---
When do you take a nap?
---
Never underestimate the complainers.
---
He's referring to not getting cat form until 20
---
Trying to get to rank 14 for the pvp weapons I believe. Currently rank 5
---
&gt;Why would they do that? Twinks almost always hunt the other twinks in the battleground. Its a rivalry.
---
Tell that to the rogue that camped non-twinks at WSG GY and completely ignored all the twinks in the bg.  Or the hunter that camped questing Horde in Stonetalon since late September, long before honor was in the game.
---
There's bound to be twinks that only go after other twinks like you say, but my experience throughout the game says the majority of twinks are not that kind of player.  Why do you think the population of twinks died overnight when they put them in their own BGs in retail?  Because a large portion of the twinking playerbase stopped queueing for BGs the second they couldn't rofl-stomp nontwinks.
---
They're all more or less equivilent. I'd lean toward swapping them out depending on which stat(s) you need. If you're mainly PVP then you don't need the +Hit as much so I'd use Ghostshroud or Eye of Rend, but if you're mainly PVE and short on +Hit I'd use the Mask
---
Nah, that would cut too much.
---
Fully half the posts on my /new feed were about the AV stuff. No need to have to scroll past all that all the time. A filter was an easy solution, thought maybe others might feel the same and not know about how to get rid of the cruft.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
I think there's some merit to it, and if it works for people then that's definitely how they should play. It just doesn't work for me. So that's what I meant when I said I wish people would do what's enjoyable.   
---
I had a roommate who I was playing with on a private server back in the beginning of the year. I was trying to get a feel for the levelling process for when Classic came out. He rolled several characters to prep for the fastest possible way to level a mage to a point where he can aoe farm.   
---
He approached it almost like a job, whereas, I was meandering around and remembering what I liked about the game. I wasn't just dicking off. I was definitely working to level up, but I knew I wasn't being efficient about it. I won't say my way was better than his way, but I know for a fact I was enjoying it a hell of a lot more.
---
Horde from Faerlina here, all 48+ in Tanaris from both factions questing, waving and dancing with each other, all 60s are in BGs.
---
i went kinda casual on last nights rush and got 62k honor for the day
---
thats 434k honor at 5 hours a day 7 days 
---
....... with AV out now, you basically gotta got by how many hours of AV do you have to sit in per day, per week.... to hit standing 1-5 on your server
---
i would esitmate your gonna need 1.4 million to reach standings that will allow a rank up beyond rank 12
---
Yep. I dicked around on my bank alt for an hour, spent an hour dicking around in WSG, then played AV the rest of the night including 1 AV that lasted 1.5 hours ... ended the night with 80k honor. 1 million looks to be the minimum for getting past rank 10.
---
You can do whatever you want now. Whatever your goal is is your business but it doesn't change the fact that AV was never intended to be played as a PvE zerg...
---
Prices on alliance mograine. Today is raid day even.
---
GFPP profit=  50s loss, 130g recipe
---
Greater Arcane Elixir, 40s profit, 550
---
Mongoose = 0 profit
---
Major mana potion = 5s profit
---
I checked a few more but its the same, only titan flask has any real profit.
---
I played about 25 or so AVs today and only won 3. Those 3 were all games where the ally tried to defend rather than just rushing Drek.   
---
Most games we lose before even engaging the boss, but we end up with way more honor though. It is what it is I guess, AV never was known for it's balance.
---
LC FTW
---
Poopsocks. I have no words.
---
I don't know if that's true or not, but I remember back in the day at some point in the game being mass voted out from a BG because I didn't have PvP gear. You know... the gear you have to do a BG to OBTAIN... lol.
---
&gt; The goal was never to force people to play it the same as they did when it was released, it was to experience the same game but in current times.
---
Lmao.
---
The nochanges galaxybrains were the same people assuring everyone how hard MC would be. 
---
They certainly do complain about how people play this 2004 game in 2019.
---
Yes, WoW is an evolving game. It evolved. People wanted it to go back. They were warned it wasn't going to be the experience they think. Here we are.
---
Invis pots are consistently profitable on my server. LIPs/resto pots usually are as well. Mainstream ones like faps/gfpp have too much competition.
---
&gt; 5 years from now there may be regret. WoW will disappear someday, but a good SO can last a lifetime.
---
Or they might divorce you and take half your shit. Classic ain't gonna divorce you; worst it might do is try to funnel you into BFA. Different priorities for different people. Good for him that he has something that fulfills him to the point of enjoying it for 8+ hours a day.
---
It's always more "efficient" to farm things that are of green difficulty to you. Whether or not it's worth it to get the robe sooner rather than later is up to you.
---
29 was good as a feral druid, there's a talent that increased your speed in cat form, made flag running easier.
---
I think a few PvP changes when they are down the road could really change the game for the better. Just need enough players to complain if it becomes an end game stalemate. They have to do something tho, patches are critical in MMOs. But for now, I'm enjoying the bliss of classic wow.
---
it was easy for me because i don't play retail :)
---
I dont know about xp within AV but you used to get exp for handing in the Mark's of Honour after the BG.
---
Streamers did nothing.  They have viewers
---
Yes, 10 is where the easy rank stop. As long as you pvp with some regularity 10 is well within reach.
---
What mainhand weapons would you pair with the offhand weapons for a heal and shadow spec? I‚Äôm looking to decide whether I want to stick with disc or go shadow and I‚Äôm struggling to set up a plan.
---
The other one has an insane addiction to the game.
---
back when people didn't understand systems and just played to play
---
Oh whoa. 9 hours of research. I played years in vanilla.
---
LMAO people were too busy thinking about their bis to notice that those pesky bankers were repacking terrible mortgages into their retirement funds.
---
1.12 was the oldest version they had intact.
---
Well for one the OP said ‚Äú1.12 like everything else‚Äù. If you find an exception his statement is false. If they were willing to arbitrarily have an older vanilla system because they thought it would be better, than it‚Äôs not a valid argument to say AV must be the final version because the game de facto is 1.12.
---
Give this man a cookie. While WSG get sorted out, this is the best HORDE strategy in PvP for this week.
---
**On any circumstances**, don't cap SH GY and do as much the other objective as you can.
---
There are multiple factors to this that contribute to the decline in twink population. Arena's/rated BG's pulled people away from twinking as a new form of competition. Adding heirlooms. Typically in the lower brackets you have 7-8 twinks and 2-3 non twinks. When splitting the bracket you now have less people to fill those gaps making queues larger on both sides. Adding xp to BGs attacted players to the non twinks brackets as a way to level exclusively through pvp. Those queues still took a while.
---
&gt;Then why did the twinking community on retail die the second they were put in BGs with full twinks?
---
Nice, hasty generalization, see I took a logic class to once and can call out fallacies.
---
It was awful. We had AVs that lasted for *weeks.* Single battles of people deadlocked. It was terrible.
---
It's a little worse now in some ways. I'll give you that, but not by much.
---
This is the best way to handle loot. The guild I'm in right now is handing out loot to the same group of people meaning we have a massive divide. While half the raid is damn near sporting full epics and 2 hammers, the other half is still full blues and even some greens. The biggest problem I have with that is that it leaves no room for the other half to improve and become better players, effectively trapping them at the lower end of the charts.
---
TBC is what I‚Äôm really waiting for to no-life anyway. Vanilla doesn‚Äôt seem worth it to me. I still love the Classic Experience, but I‚Äôm pining for TBC Paladin.
---
Fair, GL in bgs
---
About 8 hours of AV got me into Revered, I probably got lucky in that the vast majority of my runs were over in 7 minutes or less.
---
It doesn't matter win or lose when you can triple the honor gained by doing this instead.
---
Had a druid I leveled until 41 (very low play time).
---
I just started a warrior because while fun, druid was also kinda boring, and got tired of looking like a cat all the time.
---
Yes they can do everything, but they kinda suck at everything
---
Wait until you see what happens in a 20 year old elf sim.
---
Sadly the old videos of druids doing lasher farms are from private servers. Lashers on live are immune to nature, so it‚Äôs not a viable option like pservers (which lacked this immunity). It‚Äôs an issue for shaman too, as they could farm them on pservers too but not live.
---
Herbalism is your best bet. You can farm the hell out of ghost mushrooms in Mara for solid gold. You just run through both purple and orange sides, collecting all the nodes. Stealth as needed, very little (if any) killing involved. They usually sell for almost 1g each on many servers, so it‚Äôs pretty decent income.
---
How long does mara usually take!?
---
Importantly, you do not switch to shadow until shadow form is attainable at level 40. Until then, it's disc wand spec. If OP is considering priest, the youtuber Hydramist content is highly recommended.
---
No the same thing definitely did not happen. I don't know which version I'm remembering but there was definitely a time when you had to capture the towers along the way and kill other npc's rather than an immediate rush to the final boss. It was WAY more fun when it wasn't a 10min rush.
---
I was questing in felwood last night and level 60 horde were just passing me by  on my horde-dominated server. I was able to quest and farm for herbs for a while which would be impossible during all of P2.
---
I wasn't even worth the honor anymore. Such a huge change, it was almost surreal.
---
I also heard he kills aliens
---
Yep, it'll happen every week, regardless of your rank. I think there's some protections so that you can't lose more than 1 rank per week, but you'll lose the full 20% for your next calculation if you're looking to climb ranks.
---
&gt; And since this is a shared pool, it means that the only way to gain honor is now through pve, yes, the only way for horde to effectively gain a pvp "currency" is by killing 3 pve npcs and afking so the match ends quickly.
---
That was always the case.  AV was a BG where people could go kill kobalds in the mine or kill rams or wolves for xp while the other level 60s would fight it out in mid field or try and kill NPC guarding an objective.  It is like you are saying they should remove stamina from all PVE raid gear because it cannot be useful for PVP.  I just think you don't understand what AV is one bit.
---
MoD is good for pvp at 60. If you are just trying to focus on leveling it really isn‚Äôt necessary. If you are just taking your time as you level put the points where you see the value to the style you‚Äôre playing.
---
Damn I thought I was having fun! Bout to uninstall now.
---
Absolutely there are things that should be fixed, that were fixed some 14ish years ago. Those fixes were in Burning Crusade or Wrath. 
---
I stand by no changes fully out of pettiness. People screamed for classic and memed Allen Brack to death over his you think you do speech. He was right, he was always going to be right. This is the vanilla wow you asked for. You want your improvements, retail is there waiting for you.
---
r/UnexpectedStanely
---
&gt;As Horde, if you accept that Alliance will beat you in a zerg race...[snip]
---
Yeah, but they don't if you don't stop at Belinda.
---
At the end of Classic, once people have initially progressed AQ and Naxx, I wouldn't be surprised if some casuals can't be carried once everyone is super geared
---
I presume in this case he means the horde players.
---
Literally do exactly the opposite of this.  Honor doesn‚Äôt matter at all.
---
spirit of classic, and nochanges, are two vastly different viewpoints
---
Spirit of classic would have required vast changes to AV to entice multi hour long AV, in such a way that minmaxers and casuals both enjoy
---
Nochanges is the false prophet that gave us this meme AV
---
Just because we're rushing it doesn't mean we don't have fun. When we queue up for AV we usually only get about 70-80% of the premade in, which means we'll have to revise strategies every game. We split off several 5-man groups that go for smaller objectives while the rest nuke down Drek. In some cases the Horde is actually resisting and then it gets interesting. What I don't like though is when the Horde is just turtling and delaying everything. We've had a month of spamming Blizzard everywhere, it's boring. The smaller scale skirmishes are much more fun.
---
Pretty sure you were just going to try to run away, that's literally their only chance of killing a skilled resto druid.
---
Not with cross realm BGs you won't!
---
Ah yeah maybe. I had a couple 25 minute losers.
---
&gt; spend time with mrs all the while thinking about logging on to wow.
---
This is too real... Meanwhile she's thinking "is he thinking about another woman?"
---
Yes, and that woman's name is wow...
---
&gt;Classic is on 1.12
---
So... a change then.
---
Well yea if u give up it's possible, but one player pucking up the flag once will add 1-3 min to game time with them using that strat. The average game with a premade will be like 10ish minutes and almost every AV is 7-10 min, meaning that if u get more honor from wsg its because u played smart, had an op premade, and got lucky ur opponents just gave up. And in that scenario ur still not getting much more honor per hour than AV. Its more fun but its likely the same or worse honor
---
why don't they just play with their tomagachi pet?
---
This is how the game was and is. Don‚Äôt change it.
---
&gt; There's bound to be twinks that only go after other twinks like you say, but my experience throughout the game says the majority of twinks are not that kind of player. 
---
Whats that bias where you only notice people you're looking for? Confirmation bias?
---
&gt;Why do you think the population of twinks died overnight when they put them in their own BGs in retail?
---
I've adressed that in other comments, but that has to do with the amount of brackets twinks are spread across. We in the 110 bracket used to have weekly wargames every weekend, but all those players vanished when separation hit because they're not going to just play one day of the week.
---
Nobody wants to sit in queues forever.
---
For example, why doesn't anyone do AV at lower levels? Its not because its a bad battleground, low exp, or anything else besides the fact that queues dont pop.
---
Could just reuse your gold shire inn itemrack zone event outfit to also have a hotkey.
---
But its still 1.12 - does not matter what you think should be done.
---
People who sarcastically say \#NoChanges look just as dumb as all the retail fanboys who used to say "Rose tinted goggles" all the time.
---
you alright mate?

They kept the core values of the game as it was in it's original state while adding a lot of new content. Jagex will propose new skills, dungeons, bosses, etc, and then have an open poll available at booths in the game where the community can vote and decide what they want. Its led to a very well rounded game with new content that functions in the same way that it did when the game originally came out in the early 2000s.
---
The whole process behind deciding on who to give gear to and min-maxing from a guild perspective just annoys me. The guild I've been in does LootCountil, which was different than how I did loot in vanilla. My old guild did just straight rolling with some manual discretion for typical MS &gt; OS check, which we eventually graduated into a Dkp system later in BWL raids. Before it didn't matter if you had 5 piece set or 2 piece set, typically whoever wanted to MS roll could have a chance to roll on it. That was the whole appeal to me before when I was the small fry, was that I could actually go to this big raid and get some cool loot.
---
Kinda became annoying that I had lost out on both GS legs, gauntlets, and belt, because the discretion of our loot-master felt the other guy could use the upgrade more than me. I understand how that makes sense and from the efficiency POV where you want everyone more evenly geared to be more useful, it makes sense. Regardless, I lost on loot that I wanted not because I didn't actually need it or that I lost a roll for it, but just 'cause someone didn't want me to have it. 
---
Not really arguing against or for either style, cause I understand the reasoning behind why people do stuff like dkp or lootcouncil, but man it sucks when you don't even get the chance to roll for an upgrade even when it drops because of an officer's gear opinion.
---
I don't care about your server tbh.
---
Being happy causes your pet to gain loyalty. It seems that it goes faster in combat, but that's just anecdotal.
---
Madlad
---
But the real world doesn‚Äôt have an automatic quest log - I have to write one out myself and that‚Äôs just asking for to much effort.  Life needs some QoL improvements and a higher drop rate on epics.
---
That was totally a thing in classic. We definitely had alts and twinks then.
---
Wooosh
---
You can, but if you just fuck around and want to aim for a rank, you won't be able to stop pvpving for months without giving up on ranking.
---
It wasn't intended that way, but it clearly is flawed since that's the most optimal strategy. People have always tried to get the most honor.
---
Too soon Blizz!
---
people are also misrepresenting #nochanges like crazy, saying it was about preserving the spirit of the game, when in reality, we just want the game as it was because we like the game as it was, and blizzard's changes tend to make it no longer the game it was.
---
i'm #nochanges (to whatever extent is possible) until they release naxx and give us 6 months to a year to sit on it. after that, i personally want classic+, where the game is extended horizontally (no t4 or higher, just add new dungeons and raids t3 and below, especially new leveling dungeons) and rebalanced a bit to make every spec more usable, but without changing the paradigm (slow progression, classes being very unique in utility, super basic rotations, etc.), but we'll probably get BC instead, which is fine i guess.
---
This 100%, the good PvP is at lvl 60 twinks are for people who find more than 5 buttons to confusing so they stay low lvl spam gear make themselves feel good.
---
Check your advanced graphics settings and make sure the graphics output is coming from your gpu and not your CPU.
---
If you‚Äôre not clearing Rag on your second day, you‚Äôre not clearing him on your third day..
---
I intend to give the rank 10 honor farm a shot for those blues, but yeah I'm not gonna kill myself for rank 14.
---
What do you mean by "they get more rep?"  Last I checked, honor and rep gains for which warmasters are alive/dead/etc at the end of the game are global so outside of one-off kills of tower masters and guards you should get the same bonus rep as everyone who went to go kill the boss.
---
Tbh im leaving for work and tldr'd.
---
Doesn't writing a whole comment to be unread suck? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The people that hated that shit are the same people that spawned retail changes that everyone thinks are lame.
---
i guess, although in one of them someone did try to quick scoop the flag to "Mess with them"
---
2 rogues standing in their flag room insta-returned it.....
---
There has to be a reason that premade was running WSG over AV atm.....
---
the virginity is strong with this one
---
IBS will be a tiny bit better for you... but the real hard truth (speaking as a Tauren fury warrior myself) is you really need to get Edgemaster's Handguards and some good dual wield weapons.
---
For instance, if you went from 2 Handing the IBS with your devilsaur gloves to using the Rends swords with Edgemasters, you'd see about a 17% increase in your DPS. That is roughly equivalent to the same boost you'd see if you could hypothetically equip 6 or 7 Lionheart Helms.
---
&gt;Why would they do that?
---
They literally say why if you keep reading. 
---
To stomp non twinks.
---
They truly spoil the experience. They turn the game I to a lobby based dungeon runner like Spiral Knights/Destiny etc.
---
Group finder is great, auto dungeon finder and teleports are not.
---
Haha, i concede. You got me.
---
yeah I love being in -16 windchill weather rn
---
When I get home.  Usually only about 20-30 minutes.  Then I eat and start playing WoW.  Meal prepping helps a lot too.  If you don't have a slow cooker, get one.
---
Big nosed, greedy, little goblins? Nah that's not racist at all.
---
I disagree honestly, if all content was obtainable by the majority then the game would be very shallow. I'll never be rank 14 but I'm okay with that and don't think people who can play more than me should be restricted.
---
Last night I was able to aoe farm an area that was nonstop gankfest every five minutes before. It feels good.
---
To be honest I've already quit Classic (in the middle of exams too) so I've already put most rotations out of my head. Although I did remember Hunter since I main one, exactly because Hunter is so reflex and skill intensive! But again hunter in PvE is much simpler.
---
Mage is indeed not too hard in terms of keybinds. Honestly most classes are pretty okay, but I'd consider the following: Warlock uses lots of different spells (DoTs) depending on the spec. Hunter and Rogue are simple in PvE, complicated in PvP. A skilled Shaman player has a crap ton of keybinds (my shaman alt has like 30 keybinds lol) because of all the totems and shocks. So keep those in mind.
---
If I were you I'd just google some rotation guides for level 60 and look at how many buttons they press. Warrior isn't *too* extreme with the buttons, but very daunting for a new player and lots of stance dancing (3 keybinds). Paladin has a simple rotation but you're Horde. Hell I'd almost recommend priest but that's literally the only class I don't play.
---
Well I wouldn't know because I joined in BC and am only just now approaching 60 in classic.
---
I just was under the impression that farming lashers was more lucrative.
---
piggy-backing off this, what about Rank 8? I really just need the R7 and R8 boots/legs.
---
&gt; Like what the fuck would you get out of a different AV experience?
---
more fun
---
Fun is subjective.
---
I call them welfare epics because they are the items used by non raiders.  Everyone gets them
---
You will understand in 6+ months.
---
It's impossible to say exactly, but the top bracket on Stalagg will be likely 2+ million honor per week. Stalagg is one of the most competitive servers. I have two guildmates that are pushing r14, both playing 16 hours per day.
---
Work is da poop! NO MORE!
---
Why?
---
It took a little bit longer than "the second they were put in their own BGs".  But the general idea is that the ones who just wanted to roflstomp nontwinks stopped queueing immediately which made queues for the ones who wanted to play again other twinks extremely long so they left as well because of the long queues.
---
It was great, especially being a lock and getting all the other locks to coordinate an "infernal rain" on a choke point, the ensuing chaos was awesome, and then the horde would do the same thing back after they'd regrouped.
---
yeah, that's gambling. Kids are wired for it before they can speak. It's the brain mechanic that promotes things like loot boxes which. Essentially WoW is just a complicated slot machine.
---
Dagger rogue. Aged Core hands, or 5 T1 for 110 energy?
---
There is no resilience stat anymore (you could argue Versatility maybe), and you don't pillar hump always. You pretty much only pillar hump against 1 or 2 comps, and even then only during their cooldowns. The reason Arenas showcase skill over other forms of gameplay in WoW is because arenas aren't scripted. You have to know what each class is capable of doing, when they might do it, and why. Then you have to react accordingly or in advance of their action. At the current moment in arenas, cuz BfA is awesome, skill doesn't equate winning anymore. Right now gearing is so awful that unless you're willing to invest several hours a week into doing m+ keys of 10 or higher ON TOP OF doing mythic EP, you will be behind in gear and right now gear is what wins games. This is 100% Blizzard Dev's fault by not listening to their player base and catering to butthurt nerds who cry that they can't use their overpowered hero gear in rated and competitive gameplay that they spent hours farming (which i understand to an extent). What needs to happen is the Devs need to either give back vendors with PvP gear and make PvP Resilience a stat again which would in-turn make PvE gear useless in PvP and vice versa, OR the Devs need to put the Legion template system back into competitive PvP game modes where gear didn't matter and it was 100% skill based. Every 10 ilvl in Legion gave you 1% increase in stats, so someone who was fully geared would on average only have 5-6% more stats than an under-geared player. Skill was the levying factor in those games at that time. I greatly miss those days.
---
Got any evidence of that other than your anecdotal experience? Because I personally know successful, wealthy people who play the hell out of wow during their downtime. Not to mention numerous celebrities who have said they‚Äôve WoW‚Äôd over the years. The ability to afford even playing 8 hours a day indicates access to wealth either earned or inherited. You really think people grinding 8 hours/day are poor losers? Doesn‚Äôt add up if you actually think about it.
---
I don't see how them deciding between two different versions of AV that could both be considered "nochanges" is "Fucking nochanges crowd ruined it"
---
Wow isn't about FUN. It's about escaping our reality for a better one.
---
Man all these people thinking they will get rank 12-14 lol
---
Entirely depends on context. DW Fury definitely gets much better as the game goes on, but 2h fury is hella fucking good rn, and it's miles ahead currently for anything that you can cleave.
---
Same reason there are DPS twinks: to stomp non twinks. 
---
To a non twink, every twink feels like a tank anyway. 
---
The reality is nothing is preventing you from winning BGs at 60. You twink to noob stomp.
---
Are you me?
---
Have you seen facebook? You don't need anonymity to be a dick.
---
We aren't talking current R14 though, just the R14 from Vanilla. There's not a single player R14 in Classic yet.
---
No interest in retail. No interest in 2 hour long bgs.
---
Thanks for throwing normal people with lives a bone, blizz!
---
Who gives a fuck about ranking? 
---
Believe it or not, there are players who enjoy pvp that don't have 12 hours a day every day they can commit to facerolling the same BG tactics for some fancy epics 3 months later.
---
That is simply not true. Nostalgia only goes so far. The game is actually fun for what it is. It's fundamentally different and the differences are something people enjoy. That's why some people want Classic+ they would like new content expanding on this version of the game but not going down the route that WoW eventually did.
---
And it's all relative. If the mass majority of the Alliance is doing that, they you're not missing out on honor gains vs. the rest of the pack and it comes down to simply play time. Play the longest, and you've got a higher ranking. 
---
Horde honor just doesn't matter. 
---
Most just want the rep though, and then won't go back to the instance. Those Off hands and the rings (if available) are what is truly appealing.
---
Imagine calling someone Einstein
---
If you're dagger, ACLG are BIS for the entirety of classic if I'm not mistaken.
---
personally, WotLK ruined the class fantasy of Prot Pally being a 'caster tank'.   i know why they changed them to being str-based rather than int+sp but it still irked me then, and it would irk me now.
---
i would still take wotlk over retail or classic, though, by far.
---
I have a macro for fart and say ‚Äúy o u l o s e‚Äù very handy in Booty Bay. Also ‚Äúy o u r an e v i l k o r e a n‚Äù
---
Most people go 2h fury temporarily based on availability of weapons from MC. It's not "optimal", but it might be an optimal choice for specific players at a certain point in time due to what weapons they received.
---
It's also almost exclusively used on Horde side due to WF totem. I believe on Alliance you're better off going Arms, although that also runs the risk of taking up a debuff slot.
---
I dint know :&lt;
---
the real tragedy is that shamans can only use the ring that's useless for them.
---
*fuck off
---
After playing OSRS for a bit over a year, I'd have to agree. Of course there's some cons to the voting aspect, as the community will usually be idiots (Warding lol). 
---
I would love for a community based system to be implemented into Classic. Especially towards the end of the current plans and phases.
---
Different playstyles due to no mounts and you don't have to raid to get the best weapons
---
Kinda have to agree. I like the game a lot and I think Blizzard is doing a pretty good job, but holy shit the whining and toxicity on this sub is real.
---
The fuck? My bro leveled 50 to 60 during p2 and horde dominates on Kromcrush lol
---
Iron, Solid Stone (mithril) and Thorium all sell extremely well (Iron Grenades, Sappers, and thorium in general).
---
Depending on what class you are, you can even eventually start farming the rich thorium veins in DM:East solo or with a buddy to get plenty of thorium ore and arcane crystals (needed to make arcanite).
---
I might have gotten lucky with my server.
---
I have had good luck with Shadow Oil, making about 1g profit each. The water breathing ones about .50-.75 profit each. Superior Mana typically sell for 1g and I can usually buy mats for about .60. Superior Def mats can be bought for really cheap most of the time and sell decent.
---
Anything PVP related is selling really well now, though the mats can be expensive. If you can monitor the AH for fadeleaf and the swiftness potion mats on the cheap it is profitable.
---
Overall it isn't a huge profit margin, but 50s x 10 every couple days adds up quickly.
---
Then on top of that I make about 6-15g transmuting arcanite every few days.
---
I hope you get them banned for a bit. Let us know if you do.
---
Same. I sold a fuckton at the release of p2, but the price went down so far I decided to just hold on and wait for bgs, but none of my shit sold last night :(
---
It was undercut city, all night. Assholes.
---
Alliance win in a Zerg race if horde skips balinda...
---
How much does mount cost?
---
i just want my space goat windfury machine.
---
Reroll a pve server if you don't want to pvp
---
&gt; And we addressed that like 5 posts ago. You‚Äôve given no incentive and Horde will not willingly give up their advantage because YOU think it‚Äôd be more fun.
---
You were the one who did that 5 posts ago, did you forget that? YOU were the one who asserted that camping people wasn't fun. which means there *IS* an incentive for horde to transfer of.
---
&gt; THIS IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION.
---
You don't treat a fever by killing the patient.
---
&gt; You sure are backing Horde on this despite not being one,
---
So because the truth happens to be in their favour I'm "backing horde on this one"? 
---
&gt; ecause you‚Äôre all talk, but some people have lives outside of WoW and don‚Äôt want to spend 5 hours getting camped to turn in 2 quests.
---
AND THERE WE FUCKING HAVE IT. Glad you admitted it finally, go play hello kitty island adventure, you think transfering servers makes hordes suddenly vanish and you're not longer going to get ganked? (Spoiler: It wont) they're still going to get ganked, if that's something that makes them cry and makes the game "unplayable", then having them transfer off does nothing, they're still going to quit.
---
&gt;  I swear, it‚Äôs like talking to a Trumper or Anti-vaxxer, no matter how much evidence there is that points to reality, there‚Äôs someone saying ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not what I think, so it must be wrong!‚Äù
---
Haha, rigth back at you mate, have you ever tried opening the eyes to see things from other peoples point of view? No, all you see is "ree* I can't do exactly what I want at all times I have to consider what other people want in a game, that's unfair *reee*
---
So you picked horde for the sweet racials righ....
---
&gt; we don't care about pvp
---
Oh, well then it must be because you dig the flavor of the fac...
---
&gt;  or your weird rp ethos
---
Oh... So... how did you make it past the character select screen?
---
You can do it and enjoy it, world pvp exists, WSG exists, AV can easily be turtled.
---
If you do A enough you're pretty likely to get B, within reason. Example: build 1000 chairs, eventually you'll be really good and people will pay you for them. Run daily, eventually you can run a marathon. Learn to code and do leetcode, eventually Google (or wherever) will hire you. Practice talking to women, eventually you'll be charming enough to date. It's honestly the same shit IRL just replace "killing murlocs" with putting in actual effort toward real goals. WoW is just an easier escape, but you can't take your epics outside or buy a new transmission with them.
---
&gt; In vanilla the talent tree is small enough to have a viable 21/30 or 30/21 hybrid.
---
You never played a healer in vanilla, did you?
---
Or a tank.
---
Let me tell you, it sucks having to spend 50g in order to be able to tank or heal or dps or grind or farm or pvp.
---
This applied to druids, warriors, shamans, priests, paladins, any others? 
---
If you are half way serious about raiding, a half way shitty 31/20 spec for pve and pvp will suck big floppy donkey cock.
---
&gt;And fyi, the people that will actually be in the top ranks are in premades queueing with a mod. You won't catch them.
---
Queuing with a mod? Wtf
---
ish
---
Well here's the thing. Everyone can agree that this version sucks. It's a zerg afk fest that isn't fun at all. It's dumb that you can get exalted in 14 hours.
---
The bigger problem is that if you WANT to rank in PvP whatsoever, you now HAVE to play this zergfest nonstop.
---
Old AV is no changes..
---
this nerfed version is a change we didn't want and din't ask for.
---
even nost provided the real AV. Blizzard is just a trash company.
---
 My whole guild spamming AV and wondering why I'm playing WSG. Apparently I'm the only one who likes to PvP :(
---
If Alliance wipe then you‚Äôre fucked into a 30 min turtle.
---
Good for you?
---
It's fairly easy to deduct that OP wont get r14 when he's rank 5.
---
Folks, just logged in using z-pearl and bagnon and for the love of god I can't find my beloved keyring. Any idea where it's hiding?
---
shouldn't that be just one button?
---
Salt Brutosaur coming in Classic+.
---
As others have said, it's a pretty big drop, particularly because of the glancing blow penalty. 
---
If you're not going to use axes, then just get Edgemaster's and use swords. But at that point you've wasted your orc racials, so you'd be better off going troll. Plus they look better than Orcs anyway.
---
The biggest thing is community polling. Any* change requires 75% majority voting approval to be implemented. Everything from the smallest of QOL changes to major content updates are polled. Notably, the devs recently wanted to add a whole new skill (kinda like professions but more in depth and useful) to the game but it didn't pass the poll so they scrapped it.
---
*Fixes (obviously), and some random minor changes (weirdly) don't get polled.
---
Oh this is fantastic thank you
---
Oh, that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
I've heard from a hunter that elemental sharpening stones don't benefit them, which implies it's either applied to the weapon or somehow for melee skills and hits only. The former seems more likely, but would be good to know for sure.
---
Blizzard is a fucking trash company. I miss Nost so much.
---
What's the difference between the 2? if you have them maybe give me both D:
---
Btw, you broke the first rule, well done :3
---
It also has bg zone support! Never start a bg in the wrong gear again
---
Aleins
---
&gt; He literally said better to quit now than to expect blizzard to cater to your personal whims
---
&gt; What in that statement is false?nothing.
---
Is it it better to quit now than to expect blizzard to cater to your personal whims? It's not obvious to me that it is better to quit now.
---
&gt; OP doesn‚Äôt say anything about OP not being welcome in the community it just points out blizzard doesn‚Äôt care about OP.
---
Part of the way he expresses his point about blizzard is by suggesting that OP should quit the game/community. Like I said, you can argue about the strength of the three meanings of the comment. But the tone that OP should quit is there. It's a hostile tone. You could argue that OP should ignore the tone and let it slide, and most people would do that. Maybe you personally don't even notice that aspect of the comment's meaning. But some or most people who read the comment will interpret it as being somewhat hostile, and downplaying/rejecting the OP's criticism of blizzard.
---
Another way of expressing the hostile tone of the comment might be "the problem's you, it's not blizzard, quit the game if you don't like it". If you wanted to communicate that blizzard doesn't care about OP in a non-hostile way you could say "no matter how many people agree with you, it's extremely unlikely that blizzard will change anything". But the comment is far closer to the hostile version "the problem's you, not blizzard", than the non-hostile "you're right but blizzard will not change anything".
---
That doesn‚Äôt come out until phase 5 I read! I could be wrong but I didn‚Äôt see it on any of the posts about what‚Äôs available in the shop atm
---
Thinking everyone who twinks is there for that is just wishful thinking. You don‚Äôt approve of it so you think everyone who does it is an evil noob stomper. 
---
I‚Äôve been twinking since vanilla, still do in retail and classic, and that‚Äôs not been the case for me. But I don‚Äôt think this conversation is going anywhere.
---
Good question. I am also level 48 and would like to know this info too.
---
For Horde it‚Äôs 100% random.
---
1. You are dependent on Alliance being good but not too good. You want to kill Belinda before they kill Galv. You want them to end ASAP (~7 minutes) while you kill as many lieutenants and commanders as possible.
---
2. You can‚Äôt as reliably group queue as the queues aren‚Äôt instant. This makes it hard to actually win quickly if Alliance is slow or trash.
---
Therefore, Horde have no control over the AV honor grind, until everyone is sufficiently geared and the meta established, Horde honor gains could be random.
---
You could play 12 hours of AV and end up in multiple turtles and few fast games. Meanwhile someone plays 4 hours and chains 7 minute loses and beats the other in honor for the day.
---
It's fairly useless for Shaman outside of ele PvP or being a meme tank.
---
Why is that a problem?
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious. I don‚Äôt have nearly as much time as a lot of people, but I‚Äôm not sure that I really care.
---
Interesting, I didn't know that. I wonder who was the first 19 to grind their timbermaw rep to honored only to find out they couldn't use the the effect lol.
---
Friend found this out by fishing.  Don't ask.  It was funny but then it wasn't.
---
You can easily turtle it with 3-5 people. It‚Äôs not a raid BG once they nerfed it because people didn‚Äôt want to be in there for hours and not finish it.
---
Ouch that's painful to see. At least it wasn't like R14 or something.
---
The rep is far more important at this point than honor so they're kneecapping themselves hard
---
That's bad luck my friend.
---
If he's asking the vague question on Reddit "duhh how much honor" without specifics as to what server he's playing, he's not going to get rank 14. 
---
Personally I think rank 14 is something you would sooner have to live down than live up to. You can cherish the achievement all you want, but it'll only ever be for yourself. There are so many other things in WoW as well as life that can be achieved in much less time and much more concerted celebration.
---
AV in smaller numbers would work too, Honestly kind of like the warfronts in BFA, I remember playing them to just get my 'ol AV fix' sure it might not of been PvP, but it itched the same itch
---
Bruh that's not even potato. That's pony express being slowed by heavy snow tier.
---
Can anyone explain why capping SH GY forces a turtle as horde?  I haven't played a match yet but I never fully understood the mechanics of why that GY was cancer for horde to take.
---
&gt;Who gives a fuck about ranking?
---
Pretty much everyone. You're in the minority. Shut up and follow instructions.
---
Do you happen to have a source for that?
---
If you enjoy PvP then AV isn't the BG to be playing.
---
Everything except second half of UBRS mostly because I'm not sure how you'll handle the drakkisath ads (not to mention the BlackRock + 61 dragonkin trash mobs hit very hard and take a second for a ten man to burn through). Diremaul West will also be hard,  but totally doable.  I say just go for it if you all are having fun.  You'll certainly learn the dungeons well.
---
Bagnon hasnt updated to include it yet, you can disable the addon and move the keys to the keyring.  
---
Or go to the bank, deposit the key, and take it back out, they default into the key ring.  
---
I'm sure the addons will update to add them sometime soon.
---
The guys that stop and kill alliance will get the most honor, while the rest of the horde kill all the npc's.
---
Does Metroid have a gun for a hand or is it part of his suit?
---
This is a good way to root out the idiots in your match, if they are dumb enough to click the portal they prolly wont be any good in the bg anyway
---
Yeah... this is true
---
It helps greatly with server stability and responsiveness tho. So it is a net win.
---
I do this too, but as a shadow priest I have a thing setup so when I go into shadowform it makes sure my shadow gear is equipped. But... unfortunately this seems to override the zone specific one to equip AD trinket. I have not been able to find a way to set priority on certain triggers, do u know if this is possible?
---
I'd say it'd suck even more running MC with the same group 50 times without [insert the item you want] dropping, then having a trial member or a PUG join the raid and win the /roll on said item.
---
People on this sub need to understand this is a win-win for Blizzard. They're salty that the playerbase wants classic wow more than retail and they're more than happy to see people complain about "old broken systems". 
---
You think it wasn't intentional that the maintenance for BFA yesterday was done at 7AM, but the systems that were already available in Beta took an additional 8 hours to complete? They want people to pay the subscription fee, get fed up with the minimal oversight by the devs and go to the "real" game. 
---
So TL;DR: Blizzard is going all in on #NoChanges because they know some people will make the switch to retail and the "updated" systems there.
---
Dude people are crazy lol. They play the GAME like it's their job. They grind everything in rapid time and then sit around and complain there isn't content. Not to mention gatekeeping how you're supposed to play, because if they aren't min maxing every chance they get then the world will end.
---
except the guy lagging behind who is going to be ambushed by two undead rogues.
---
I capped snowfall and nobody even said anything, just mindless zerg to the end...game was over in 7 mins.  If there isn't a wipe it doesn't matter much.
---
Correct
---
You think you do, but you don't. Don't ruin my retail zerg experience. Av was one of the main few reasons I wanted to play classic and it's the same shit as retail, great job blizzard. Though the minmaxing community is a big part of the reason it's a pve zone.
---
Apply for different jobs with better pay and bullshit the interviews.
---
Do this 4 or 5 times and you'll be in a better place.
---
I did this without any good grades from school.
---
Jumped up an extra ¬£10k in about 3 years just from constantly applying and bullshitting
---
&gt; It would slow the game down a lot
---
yay?
---
And I hate that rogues can stun lock me until I'm dead, but that's Classic. You don't want to break the floodgates that is class balance.
---
I‚Äôm not sure where in his comment says anything about the inability to receive xp in AV. Work on your reading skills bud
---
Don't use r1
---
Ye but you missed my point. At least from my experience, people get social during dungeon runs either because the dungeon requires coordination or they get bored while autoattacking and not because you have to whisp 3 words to someone for an inv.
---
i had my full rank 10 set way before Naxx came out...
---
"#nochanges" was dead from the beginning. We have had goddamn layers on. We're entering MC with 16 debuff slots, post the MC nerf.
---
Back in the day we used a system called Karma. It mixed rolling and DKP bidding. You could accumulate your points up to a certain point, then spend them in the form of a modifier on your rolls. So if you had 15 Karma points, you could spend them to add 15 to your roll on the gear. Felt pretty good. You didn't have 0 chance of getting gear if you were newer, but you also had better odds of gearing if you were dedicated to the raid.
---
its bad but at least you still have some control. I feel like fear is a stunlock that puts you in worse positions lol.
---
Probably correct. MMR tied rewards and a ranked PvP system, would like make it more PvP centric.
---
DUDE THIS WAS FUCKING ME. I had to turn down my scaling so everything was a blur.
---
When I first logged on I got a message saying "New hardware detected, revert to default settings"
---
THANK YOU.
---
No, I mean MC / Ony carries. Not low level runs.
---
I feel like private servers that figured out all the knowledge because classic was the dominant scene in private servers. Like I know way less about bc or wrath than I do about classic because there is way more information about classic avaliable. 
---
Most players havn't been playing classic for 14 years but some have and it's those guys that have figured out everything and now the knowledge is so accessable.
---
There's no such thing as anyone being "naturally" the best at anything in life. The best takes a combination of natural skill plus hours upon hours of dedicated practice. You will never have a situation where someone who doesn't participate in something will be "naturally" the best at anything.
---
I don't *like* twinking, but I recognize the draw. 
---
The downside is that it discourages folks who aren't actively twinking from trying the battlegrounds (myself included when I first started in BC). It's incredibly discouraging to be at such a massive gap so early in the game without the tools to level the field slightly.
---
It really feels like a catch 22 that I never really can enjoy getting the lower-level BG gear because trying to participate is just hoping your team has more twinks or that the twinks are so busy killing one another that you can sneak a flag cap.
---
Big brain thinking right here.
---
yeah i hate that too, but thats kinda what the class does.
---
Yeah, noticed a shift as the night went on as well.  We aren't going to win, so we might as well at least farm as much honor as we can while the match lasts.
---
I KNOW I'M SORRY
---
WotLK without flying (redo zones where necessary to adapt for ground travel) and without dungeon finder would be amazing.
---
Please for the love of god. I know Balinda, Dun Baldur and Van. Didn't understand anything else. I just follow the largest group of people.
---
Because blizzard didnt want to take the effort to recreate an enjoyable AV experience.
---
"HES AT 20%, NOW SLAP THE CLOWN NOSE FOR SOME BIG NUMBERS"
---
Yea, I believe agi adds rAP to even warriors.
---
The way you described them is what I would consider evil. Ruining noobs day just for a power rush.
---
Not my experience but okay.
---
Everyone in this thread right now [https://i.imgur.com/QFzwJPF.png](https://i.imgur.com/QFzwJPF.png)
---
Where are you reading they did 1.5k per arrow?? I dont think either team could get through at all if that was the case. That would almost 2 shot everyone except warriors/hunts/shamans.
---
In later patches there are minelayers aswell to stop the zerg
---
Day one a dude on my server already has over 200k honor so over a million to rank up.
---
No, if the odds of getting an upgrade are the same regardless of the dungeon, you run the dungeon that's fastest.
---
Gear drop system is good as it is now. Your idea could just lead to retail system at the end
---
Nope. Flying is great. Icecrown and Stormpeaks are fantastic as they are.
---
This comment really shows how little you know about how the honor system works. Go ahead and keep taking those ‚Äútrades‚Äù :)
---
Better on digital ranking on 2 fronts and just an overall better experience IMO. There was little coordination going on, any coordination was ignored by half the players and the people trying to take charge had contradictory ideas so the half actually listening still didn't get anywhere. Overall, people continuously ran into the entire horde forces as soon as they rezzed so they pretty much didn't have any impact and it took 40 min for the horde to crawl their way to a win because they wiped a couple of times trying to down the boss.
---
U get 300 rep for kill + 100 from turn in if you win AV. 
---
If you kill balinda and at least 5+ lieutenants and 2 commanders (which is very easy to do even if ally rush straight to drek) you get 2k+ honor and around 300-350 rep.
---
Ill taks the honor AND rep and instead alliance are the ones sweating to kill drek fast enough while were just chillin on horde.
---
Wasnt a thing that you could reflect freeze traps from hunters? still not here LUL
---
Lobster, cuddles, and the occasional blood bath it is then.
---
.... either you totally don't understand how honor work, or you are replying to the wrong person.
---
So you are upset the new content released is the biggest topic on the Reddit page?
---
Odd logic
---
For 99% of ppl Rank 14 means you're account sharing or don't have a job
---
Just a note, make sure you get into combat with enemy faction members as soon and as often as possible.  If enough people are pissed at you, they can mass report you as afk to give you that debuff.
---
Not if horde backdoors.   Every AV that horde does this I won.    That‚Äôs if the majority of toons do same.
---
I know both of you are trolling/joking, but if someone told me what even joking i'd do the oposite just like you rofl.
---
From someone lower in the thread: "Check your advanced graphics settings and make sure the graphics output is coming from your gpu and not your CPU."
---
I got the afk debuff as soon as the gates opened because a 5 man group from Herod whispered me asking for a portal to IF trying to get me to drop a portal on the group. I ignored their whispers and they all flagged me. They were also flagging everyone with 60% mounts and those who werent zerging. AV has been a shitshow.
---
Completely feel you on this, I think it's so cool you summoned the ice Lord, and the way people are playing AV now is incredibly dull.
---
It likely was flagged as "NA Horde" is commonly used in recruiting posts.
---
Im guessing we will see them Phase 4 with the release of AB
---
There's no time to shake hands. That would ruin the honor/minute.
---
Haven't tried wg but av has been like 5 min.
---
For the AV mount you only need exalted
---
For the generic PvP mounts you need 11 IIRC

False. Flying is one of the biggest mistakes ever made.

According to DB it isn‚Äôt out till phase 5:

---
There won't be an oasis if you just AFK in Orgrimmar the whole time. You gotta go out and actually do quests/raid.
---
Because Alliance then spawn all the way back at their bridge and being the same fucking idiots as Horde they start defending so it turns into a huge turtle shitshow where people just run around and kill eachother without anyone actualy trying to win. It usualy results in both raids being scatered all over the map and doing some random PvP while some wannabe generals yell at people in chat calling them all kinds of names.
---
Players: Give us Classic!
---
Blizzard: You think you do but you don't.
---
Blizzard: Well fine, here's Classic.
---
Players: Umm.. shit... can we make some quality of life adjustments?
---
Blizzard: You mean The Burning Crusade and onward?
---
Players: NO. I want to play Classic but I also want you do change it because there are a lot of serious issues with it that make me not want to play it. 
---
Blizzard: Like we said, you think you do but you don't.
---
And then you had the hyper casual players like me back in the day, who while they might've been 60.. were in a mix match of 40-50 gear, which the already undergeared people (maybe in 51-58 gear.) with some in dungeon 0 gear, and maybe the most geared being that odd raid tank with quel'serrar, and some T1.
---
yes, 1.5k per arrow from ten archer in each bunker, who can reach the middle of the bridge...
---
seems totally reasonable. If we're playing with WoTLK HP values.
---
Enhancement in vanilla is such a sad spec to look at. If it had actual gameplay Shaman would probably be way more popular than it is. Same with Ret/Prot pally
---
Realy? Its both boring af but with npc's you at least dont annoy other people :p
---
I absolutely *loved* WSG yesterday, but I literally never lost a game and for one my team ended up farming the Alliance for a good 30 minutes before we finally got bored and let them go.
---
Yep that's how it was before the nerd. One of many things in place to stop a zero
---
It‚Äôs /script ToggleBag(-2) I read yesterday. Haven‚Äôt tried yet tho
---
But people want to play AV, as intended, for fun, too. I'm sorry I don't feel much sympathy for the rep grinders, especially when it's fucking up my good time.
---
Not an add on, I try to live the true to the game.
---
In settings under interface, there‚Äôs a section called raid profiles. At work right now so going off memory but you should find it quickly
---
As a healer, I've noticed this a lot.  At the same time, I don't really mind.  As long as the tank is aware of my mana and my limitations, he can pull as fast as he thinks we can handle.  I don't mind cutting 10-30 minutes from a dungeon.  I did Scholomance in just under an hour from zoning with zero party deaths.  That's impressive in my book.
---
Try trainspotting
---
There was also a mine-field by one of the towers too that would 1 shot you if you didn't take tower.. this version of AV was nerfed substantially which is why you can even pull drek without getting 1 shot if towers are up
---
Not terrible, ally is instant.
---
BG WEEKENDS grant a certain bg DOUBLE HONOR, So none of the bg's are pointless.
---
I did a couple quest, but they were all quests from outside. I didn't do any that start and ended inside
---
It was actually awesome, don't bash something you didn't experience and don't understand
---
Ok Stanley
---
Wasn't this fortold? Pretty sure people warned this would happen.
---
Thank you very much
---
And ab gives most honor per time spent if you're good
---
&gt;Irregardless
---
Why do people use this word?
---
Super fast. Usually around 1.8k-2k honor each game. They're just elites with 20-30k life.
---
Only if it makes my numbers bigger.
---
It is great for a warrior too, not just a pally
---
The issue is that they did change the game, they didn't apply the #nochange. People are bitching about that, stop trying to pretend otherwise you cunt.
---
1. Increasing server population by 3 to 10 times the original limit directly impacted the gameplay and was a HUGE CHANGE.
---
2. Releasing AV in its 1.12 state directly impacted the gameplay and was a HUGE CHANGE.
---
Yes but originally it actually gave more honor than AV so you were rewarded for it.
---
there are no HK's in rush games therefore no DR. I can play 5 AV's and get 2 HK's
---
We are not speaking about damage output, but about ways to get gold.  
---
So if you compare with mage or hunter - both ret and holy earn the same.
---
Then afk out
---
&gt;Maybe one day you'll find love and understand. 
---
He did find love. It's Rank 14.

I want to try this but now I'm scared of being reported lol
---
Ur stealthers can go in a cap the tower/bunkers to get rid of them.
---
Make  Kargath  great again
---
Idk about spriest but I have +350 frost damage and can easily get another 100 once I get 2 fairly common drops. That not even including rarer drops like the spell power ring, trinket, and neck from MC or the pvp gear set bonus that could probably push me up to like +500 frost damage if I was fully geared.
---
Yeah I really wish they didn't make the BG's xserver, or at least made them try hard to not xserver during the matching process.  With the current setup it practically encourages people to be dicks to eachother, there's no consequences and no downside.  Like most everything on retail!
---
What people want is a fresh mmo where nobody knows shit and is popular
---
Was gonna say I‚Äôm sure a lot of Germans speak better English than people from certain regions of the UK
---
I made it about halfway through a mine solo before it ends, can't get shit done.
---
Don‚Äôt bother. You will never reach rank 14
---
At max level because of their mobility. But you don't have any mobility @ 19. You're just a shitty Warrior.
---
Good luck finding one.  Nobody was streaming/uploading gameplay videos to youtube 15 years ago.
---
&gt;casual dad with 14 kids and 3 wives that can play 18 minutes a day good.

---
I'd vote "class balance" so hard.  I'd love for all the Classic classes to all have three fully useful talent trees.  And for things like a "Curse of the Elements" but for nature/holy damage to exist.
---
That would make you win. Horde intentionally does not want to win.
---
Sprechen Sie Deutsch nicht?
---
Neither of them provided much evidence, to be fair.
---
Yep. Ur point
---
You unironically think that blizzard wants to ‚Äòwrap up‚Äô a revenue stream of millions of dollars? 
---
People said this about retail when they didn‚Äôt like it. Blizzard is wrapping up WoW and moving on to other things. 
---
You‚Äôre crazy if you think that they don‚Äôt want to make money lol 
---
I could see them trying to time phase 6 to be a bit ahead of shadowlands release so that people can finish the ‚Äòtrue classic experience‚Äô and have a new expansion waiting for them. 
---
But if you think for a second that blizzard doesn‚Äôt want people to play classic and pay a sub forever, you‚Äôre just not living in reality.
---
Can't stress enough that upgrading your weapon at regular intervals (at least every 10 levels, more frequently between 40-60) makes it so much easier. Suggest going fury (2h or 1h) to lvl 40 then swapping to arms when you get mortal strike. Max out first aid asap (i got runecloth at lvl 35).. As alliance you can get the BoneBiter axe from SM quest chain and it's better than WW axe imo.. that quest is painful unless you get carried.
---
Wow really?? Only frost wolf mount and no training and boom, you got yourself an epic mount?!
---
Yeah, let's blame 1.12 AV map with 1.6 AV rewards and Phase 6 PVP rewards during Phase 2 PVP on the #nochanges crowd.
---
Aight bud.
---
Forces Ally to spawn much further back on their side of the map which means that their best chance is no longer to try to Zerg a win, but to defend the choke point at the bridge. That means fewer people up at Drak so more people die and more people get sent back home behind the Horde push. Boom turtle.
---
Yes you can "report player is away"
---
In my opinion from the options given, I'd say the Shaman. I actually think all your options are good but if PVP is your bread and butter then I think the Shaman will go the distance for you. The reason why is because unlike the other options you can change how to do your damage as a Shaman, whether as a caster or a melee dps. You can also decide to heal if you like. I also think that mechanically the Shaman will go a long way for you too thanks to awesome abilities like Purge, Grounding Totem, and Ghost Wolf (for before you get your mount) that will do a lot of work for you in PVP.
---
he's not
---
If they hadn't intentionally nerfed the warmaster buffs there would be no way to kill the boss without burning towers. Blizzard did this intentionally.
---
It's like those obnoxious golfers that ruin the game for everyone ahead of them by trying to rush them and tell at then and such. Your only option is to let them 'play through', which is what Blizzard is doing.
---
Gotta delete your saved variables file. It's at wtf\accounts\account_name\savedvariables\monolithdkp.lua
---
The big difference is that people will die while zerging. By the time you got to Van, you would have 3 people left.
---
You basically had to cap graveyards and couldn't afford to skip objectives.
---
The pugging potential will be nice.
---
I'm jumping into a busy season soon in my job. Can't commit to any raid schedule - hopefully pugging will be more common then.
---
I think a lot of people, me included, have this underlying sense of anxiety when playing Classic. When I first played WoW I was younger and clueless, and the game was already 5+ years old so I just did everything at my own pace. Now in Classic I constantly feel I'll be left in the dust if I don't grind dungeons for gear, farm as much gold as possible, or buy recipes/mats before their prices skyrocket. Unlike the original WoW, there won't be as much of an influx of new players to Classic unless a miracle happens, so the amount of non-60s doing non-60 content will continuously decline despite some people playing alts. Some will say the lack of daily quests makes you feel no longer falling behind but the feeling is still here nonetheless. In a MMO without an ever-expanding playerbase, you are falling behind by default if you don't sink an above-average amount of time.
---
That's the way to change things...
---
Unfortunately most of the classic experience so far has been about maximising your epeen points. We had people threaten to report others for "afk" in AV while they were trying to clear the mines or get the trinket in multiple games yesterday.  It's not about fun anymore.
---
Gift of the Wild: Why do any of us come to this sub for anything?
---
No. At 19 the best FC is absolutely, without a doubt a druid. You can shift out of snares and you have the most HP by a large margin. This is not just my opinion it's fact.
---
Fuck bgs, I just wanna do stuff in the world.
---
Bro why are you being so fucking pedantic? What do you gain from this? I've seen you comment on other shit you clearly you understand the concept of what we're discussing.
---
I'll break it down for you anyway.
---
&gt;Its not PvP because you chose to run away and hide
---
No, it's not PVP because the majority of the horde / alliance would rather be farming honour/rep respectively. So they ignore each other and rush the generals "zerging" them. Horde loses in a **ZERG BATTLE**  because alliance has map advantage (see above comment) and gets objectives done sooner.
---
&gt;And you chose to run away and hide because if you fought, you think you'd lose. Interesting theory.
---
No I did not say this. Actually I'm impressed you somehow came to this conclusion from what I wrote. Kudos. It's not PVP because the majority of Ally and Horde would rather be farming rep/honor and if you do anything else you get flamed by 39 people(or even kicked! 5 reports is all it takes for you to get removed!). Not only that, if you do go against what the majority is doing it doesn't matter because you'd be going 1v40 vs the Alliance.
---
&gt;Horde can win a PVP battle but are heavily disadvantaged in Zergs 
---
Since you apparently can't read I'll write it down in more detail.  If the Horde played the game like it was supposed to be played (engaging the alliance/capturing points) they could win (like the OP suggested). However people don't give 2 shits about winning they want the highest honour/minute which is why they do Zerg rushes (PVE). Even though they don't win they still get a ton of honour.
---
The only "interesting theory" here is that you either lack reading comprehension or you're feigning ignorance to try and be right. I have no clue.
---
Nost was trash? Hahaha okay, now I know you're just here to cause drama. You're hoping Classic will fail, because it will give you a sense of satisfaction that you were right. When it was a smash hit at release, you couldn't stand it, and do you just HAD to ensure it failed by starting a bunch of drama and infighting, posing as a Classic player.
---
To everyone else: ignore this person, he's acting in bad faith.
---
I never twinked, probably won't. but.. I'll be that odd leveler queing for BGs at low levels (even though I know I'll get absolutely shat on.) but if my baby little heal can heal that hunter before that other hunter kills him and it leads to the kill. I'ma do it.
---
Wowhead showing the trinket is not in until phase 3, and it was right about the other items so i'm inclined to believe
---
Yup, so why would this - something we knew was coming ages ago - make a difference?
---
O wow did that use to be a thing?? Did the restart to hotfix that??
---
Hope it stays like this
---
Good job completely missing the point.
---
Same could be said for any wow-player that keeps whining about wow on reddit. The difference is I don't pay money for what I do, while wow-players do pay money.
---
Also this doesn't upset me. If anything, it is nice knowing that no matter how low I go, I will never be as low as people who pay monthy subscribtion to something they dislike.
---
Score is 2-0, with horde walking their third flag back. At that point, it might be better to take the loss and move on... granted the horde fucking dragged this out, but the alliance couldn‚Äôt stop that. They might have just been GY camped for ages if they had.
---
druids cant wear mail armor, they wear leather
---
I've spent the majority of every AV game fishing or leveling my weapon skills. Haven't been kicked yet.
---
Because the game isn‚Äôt called ‚Äúhonor per hour,‚Äù it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúAlterac Valley.‚Äù If you want a spreadsheet go fucking play Excel.
---
AV has nothing to do with PvE or PvP server lol..
---
Its nice to know the general toxicity of wow classic wasn't me being sensitive back then.
---
You can do it brother, I belive in you!!
---
Not sure I understand your point. The flood of people camping instances, flight paths, etc. have now been diverted into battlegrounds. On PVP servers, pre AV/WSG, it was very difficult to do anything in the open world without being interrupted by gank squads, unless of course you were in your own squad. 
---
Instead of mindlessly grinding HKs, ruining someone else's fun by repeatedly ganking them, honor farmers now mindlessly grind in BGs. Both experiences are not very thrilling, hence the 'mindless' descriptor. 
---
People are going to do whatever nets them the most honor and I am all for that not being something that requires actively ruining random people's fun by repeatedly killing them in the open world.
---
It‚Äôs def at least in TBC. That‚Äôs when I stopped playing and I remembered it always being there
---
It sounds like the optimal strategy is to drive for a \~12 minute win...
---
1. Shave off a small force for defense that stays back with Drek.
---
2. Send 5 to kill Bal and LTs along the way.
---
3. Everyone else pushes north to Vann.
---
4. Do not cap SH GY.
---
5. Bal/LT group join main zerg on Vann.
---
The defense holds off the Alliance zerg just enough, Bal and LTs are downed, 30+ people zerg Vann and Horde wins.
---
What do you get from Mara, stuff that you disenchant, stuff you sell or herbs?
---
You couldn't rush old av. You would just die to the npcs and mines.
---
Alliance premades are surely something.
---
I would have liked to start from a earlier patch but all the cry babies scurd of the windfurys.
---
Jk, I know bliz didn't keep any files earlier then 1.12 that they could find
---
That's why you dont cap SH graveyard smh
---
The Meta is to get rep, you are not suppose to pvp and have fun
---
Well that I think was changed and the original set bonuses were different but we get the 1.12 tier sets
---
Lol must be a bad battlegroup. Alliance on east coas na rarely lose.
---
can confirm this is fax, tink here would do this all the time to KOS players. if u on opp fac u get gy camped.
---
Write up a ticket, GMs can check your instances to find the people abusing the system
---
only if you cap the wrong GYs
---
So... Why did you ask? You clearly already knew what prevents cleave groups from doing bosses. Themselves, mostly.
---
I want an off hand, and Excel doesn't have any BiS for me.  I would probably play spreadsheets if they did...
---
I personally wouldn't have an issue with them adjusting how much honor gives to put AV in line with what someone engaging in actual PvP could get.  Just toning down the honor from NPCs would work wonders.
---
AV spewing honor isn't the #nochanges hill we should all die on.
---
I grinded dungeons and I had about 15 days of play time when I hit 60 on my warrior. Weapons and gear would really help so it might significantly make it quicker. Also buying bandages might also significantly improve the time. You have no idea how annoying it is to miss and parry legitimately 7 times in a row, I‚Äôm not kidding, you will miss and parry 7 times in a row and be killed by a single mob. 
---
Personally with gear and bandages I think it would take about 10-12 days of in game time to level to 60 if you‚Äôve never played the class. There really is no short cut when it comes to warriors. Be very sure you want to invest the time. 
---
I know this didn‚Äôt answer your question but I wanted to provide some expectations
---
It was literally designed to be a race for PvE. It's the only battleground with the mechanic ...
---
Do the same back to them. Now we‚Äôre playing AFK Valley.
---
Well if you want to get into the philosophy of it then there isnt really a reason. again, it's all opinion. I dont think it should be that way because I dont like it that way. I dont like that I cant access parts of the game, not because I have a life, but because someone somewhere else that I will literally never see or interact with has chosen to give up theirs.
---
If you dont agree, fine. Enjoy playing 20 hours a day or getting waffle-stomped in pvp by the ones that do. I dont enjoy that.
---
It only takes about 5 players out of 40 to turn the match into a turtle, I suggest you try it because I had a lot of fun. The strategy of zerging through without capping anything makes the raid very vulnerable. Kill a few horde/ally at the start of the game and they'll spawn backwards initiating some actual PvP. Then the raid will be wiped at the boss and people will HAVE to PvP to win.
---
It's almost as if people have differing opinions
---
&gt; Horde will take longer to get rep levels, but are gaining honor at a faster rate.
---
It doesn't matter if they get more honor than Alliance.  Honor is only relative to your own faction; it's completely meaningless to compare honor between Horde and Alliance.
---
But it's exactly the same as in Classic... You are literally just moving items to a different boss. For example Trustrike Shoulders to Rivendare, or the mage pimp hat to one of the Dire Maul Guards.
---
Precisely. No doubt there were many ppl just here for nostalgia, but I genuinely feel that vanilla wow, had it been released in 2019, would be superior to retail as is, issues and all. I want an MMO RPG, not a dumbed down mobile game.
---
&gt; I've seen you comment on other shit you clearly you understand the concept of what we're discussing.
---
I clearly dont understand wtf youre trying to say, dude. 
---
Im still just hearing a bunch of "we cant win so its not pvp cry cry moan moan". IDK dude. Try retail? Maybe you'll like it better.
---
The morons leading the pugs never say that, they just insist on zerging Balinda and the LTs.
---
The data says otherwise!
---
Reminds me of the innkeeper in Hellfire Peninsula, Floyd Pinkus or whatever
---
My favorite is the ally mage sitting in ice block surrounded by 20 horde who tells "1 V1"
---
You 3manned it? Impressive
---
Right, literally just chilling in 5pc might and the rest crit gear
---
Why would you not want the improved blessings?
---
Complaining about people complaining is the new meta
---
thats why i said im salty, im not really bitching about it.  If they WOULD make changes thats what I want addressed, all hypothetical.
---
You can shift like 3 times before you're out of mana since you don't have travel form. And you take more damage than a Warrior because you don't have access to armor rings/trinkets, while Warriors have defensive stance.
---
I'm not sure, I play alliance ;)
---
The xp comes from the turn in of the 3 commendations so 3 losses per 5k xp or one win
---
BRE and OEB are both swords, i dont get it
---
which is what a lot of these people are after right, fun/hour over honor/hour or rep/hour
---
different people after different things, i don't exactly like the pvp in wow in general and this kind of PvP (IE not arenas) means I want in and then out, not like I can get R14 so then grind it the fastest way and GTFO more or less.
---
Honestly I'd just tell them that you wanted to get into another guild that more realistically will progress through BWL, there's no shame in wanting to see more content/be more competitive. If they're cool guys just add those that you talk to regularly on your friend list and you would still be able to run dungeons etc with them.

You're comparing phase 2 to phase 2.5. I'm comparing Classic to Vanilla.
---
im on my fourth cup of coffee at 130 pm, but hey i hit level 57 last night
---
Which was the problem with arena, it forces specific team comps, which in turn forces homogenisation.
---
Yeah I'm totally off base, nobody stacked resilience and pillar humped.
---
&gt;It has it's place in 2019, for the same reasons it did before: Because this is a fucking game played to have some fun, and despite everyone who just wants rep saying to the contrary, a lot of people do enjoy it.
---
Oh I agree 100%. In an ideal world you could queue for either one so the rushers could have the PvE zergfest and the rest of us could play it the way it was originally intended, but that'll never happen. Vanilla was released while I was in college so for me it meant waking up, playing AV for an hour or two, going to class all day, then coming home to the same AV I left and playing that until 2am. Being an adult now, I might only get 15-30 minutes before work and an hour or two after work before calling it a night (well before midnight) but the idea of being able to re-join an hours (days?) long AV just tickles me, even if it doesn't result in optimal honor/hr.
---
Not sure but none of the AV quests show up on my map/mini-map.
---
hey, thanks! we try :)
---
That's not actually true though.  It was more like "We want Vanilla", and not "We want the 1.12 version of Vanilla".
---
that the general consensus you are gathering?
---
i see it totally differently, many player gripes are not because some of these original systems are so bad(some absolutely are lacking and have been improved on) but the base game is still more desirable compared to retail. much of the problem is knowing exactly what your character needs to be doing before classic was even playable.
---
classic is a good game, and people want a good game. but they also want a new game more than anything. but all the new stuff has been very clearly lacking in the past 10 years.
---
Op racials
---
I'm in a nice raiding guild. We raid once a week so that's 3-4 hours. I don't have to do anything else. So it's as little or much as you want.
---
I'm not good with tech, could you possibly explain the steps to do this please? having big lag issues.. :(
---
Dungeons. Go do lbrs till 60.
---
Hey man, I agree with your thoughts and would be very interested in reading the full read. Would you PM me your semester special? &lt;3
---
Agreed! I always thought it was an interesting idea to take a bunch of people who might otherwise be anti-social and force them to interact with others.
---
Crybaby: ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt *want* to interact with others!! &lt;stomps feet&gt;
---
Then go play another game!
---
Much like back in the day, I was in WSG on Ally against a horde premade, after it becamse obvoius we were being farmed for honor, we all gave up
---
Lifes better when you dont assume people need the /s tag :)
---
"I've got the bomb but I don't need to move, I'm a mage with ice block.
---
You're a legend mate !! can't tell you how much I appreciate it this. Woke up with a killer hangover today and thought the stuttering was just my brain being screwed up, thank you so much !
---
Its like blizzard want to make the experience as painful as possible.
---
Im Happy we got AV, thats it, i dont give shit which version it is. 
---
Should have assumed its The version that corralates to The patch. 
---
If it was 1.5 people would be so mad about rich thorium / Black lotus situation.
---
Think it's more about filling a month of weekends  once ab gets in the rotation can start.
---
Its pretty easy to do, you message your class officer a list of 5 things.  You can update it once a week if you want.   If you dont have anything submitted you are only there for free rolls nobody wants.   People will send a 20 word message on discord for loot.
---
Yes waiting for people is really cool, and I just love it.
---
I like that you covered the orc with an orc.
---
Well as alliance you do. 
---
Horde needs to do something to intervene with alliance in order to win.
---
Age embitters or melows.
---
Most people playing classic wow are in late 20's to mid 30's, perhaps older.
---
People are either very chill, or life hasn't been going their way for a long time so it's either be a cunt in a video game or shoot up a mall.
---
Lol you say skill is doing a premade with hopes of matching with pugs and beating them quickly? Do you even listen to yourself?
---
I've always found defense more fun in general on AV, even during TBC.
---
I find you can get a lot better fights going. And as a rogue it's fun to pick off stragglers.
---
Ony is a 20 man if you're brave enough
---
Welcome to the WoW community. Regardless if you play classic or retail, there are people bitching about everything at every turn.
---
I sure hope they are taking it seriously, I have a bag full of Meadow Ring of Eluding that I paid under 1g each for that I'm hoping to turn into my epic mount...
---
Well players are allowed to play however they want. If zerging is a cheese strat then flight path camping is also a cheese strat. Its in the game and the fact is that more people prefer to zerg than to turtle. I hope it only becomes a zerg going forward and blizzard never makes attempts to slow down AV
---
They probably are doing this to kick anyone out not from their premade, while they have their guys queue for that BG number waiting for you all to get removed.
---
Scarab Lord, I just turned 26 and am looking at switching jobs this year. I think I can take time off from the new job to do the grind and I‚Äôve got a bunch of guildies who have said they‚Äôd help.
---
People abusing the afk reporting system to kick players out and get their friends in..
---
Hate to break it to you, but most casuals aren't any worse  than most people rolling through brd in a 20 man raid farming honor. Wpvp in it's current form doesn't require any skill.
---
absolutely same here. Long AV is best AV
---
I've been playing a rogue since day 1 in 2004.  
---
I'm ready to play an alt seriously all the way to 60 and grind out my pre-bis.  I've been leaning Warrior since I'm so used to melee, and changing to both a non-stealth class as well as ranged seems like too much change.  The reason I haven't started already is because I've been flip flopping between Tauren and Orc, and can't make up my damn mind.
---
Should I take my indecisiveness as a sign and go Mage or Hunter, or should I make a decision and roll Warrior?  Anyone else in the same boat as a lifer rogue and have a class they enjoyed switching to? Help meeee
---
Need a portal? Queue to AV and avoid tipping a mage. 
---
Jokes on them.
---
Was AV honor nerfed on pservers or did pservers players not realise the meta?
---
In my guild MC in vanilla. I think we were about to pull Garr, one of our hunters said "afk, mom fell through the ceiling!" ofc nobody believed it, it was too absurd. 
---
He didn't come back til the next day. He posted the pictures to our guild forum... apparently his mom was in the attic looking for something, stepped in the wrong spot, and sure enough, there was a person-sized hole in the ceiling and a room and PC absolutely covered in drywall/dust. He had to play from the kitchen table for a few weeks after that.
---
I‚Äôve yet to lose to a rogue in WPvP or BGs in a 1v1... so we‚Äôll see
---
It‚Äôs probably just this, sucks there‚Äôs no warning and you can be kicked before anything even happens
---
Show me where the classic wow talent tree touched you lol
---
If the rogue can get in stealth, they can sap the warrior and eat.
---
I think you may have upset OP.
---
Great metaphor lol
---
Aye with arenas they introduced a competitive format into what in no way was a competitive designed game. That‚Äôs partly what I loved about wow pvp bk then tho. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love me some competitive game, regularly do sc2, dota etc, but not every game has to be competitively designed or competitively fair. Let wow be an MMO RPG first, pvp second. For one thing gear inherently breaks any competitive fairness (oh god shadowmourne in Wrath, not to mention the many trinkets over the years that have been bonkers)
---
It's hilarious.
---
We were up 2-0 and we dropped the flag one time and this dude on our team was having an actual meltdown.
---
Means the opposite side gets geared just as fast as us. That's no good!
---
So get some friends and guildies who like to Pvp and make a premade.
---
It's not "1,000 crybabies on the forums" that caused changes. It's years and years of problems that players had legitimate complaints about and Blizzard slowly fixed it over a decade and a half. Sure, if you go back to it if you haven't played for years and all of a sudden OH NO BLIZZARD MADE ALL OF THESE CHANGES TO APPEASE DUMB BABIES. 
---
The change with FPs was due to genuine complaints. Especially with the changes made in Cataclysm, where the story and environment changed significantly. We didn't have to run 10 minutes across Ashenvale anymore as Alliance, we had a FP now on the eastern side of the zone, and when you have quests to just run back and forth for 10 minutes, those new flight paths helped a ton. 
---
Mailboxes can now be found at pretty much every small town, which is super convenient. Why do I need to go out of my way to get my auction mail when I could just go to the nearest town?
---
Flying was also something that players got used to and loved, and have consistently enjoyed it (or hated it depending on the person). So Blizzard found a solution to this by making you _earn_ your flying by playing the game, and giving a whistle to get you to where you need to be (which was basically just a budget hearthstone).
---
These are QOL improvements over years and years of the game changing that were wanted at the time because of consistent player complaints. You can blame Blizzard all you want, but it's stuff players asked for.
---
I think it is a combination of the two.  You're totally right that by WotLK all dungeons were just spamfests of AOE with nobody talking and evrybody silently zerging through and calling out roles.  Without the social aspect of needing to get a group, you lose a lot of the benefits of making friends.
---
I know, I‚Äôm just teasing. I actually had a good laugh when I first saw this
---
Did the OP *just* figure out the sub isnt just 1 person or something?
---
A bigger argument against Mana Igniting going to warlocks right now would probably be Sash of Whispered Secrets. It's fairly close to Mana Igniting for personal DPS on warlocks and your only competition would be Shadow Priests. Ideally, guilds would let Mana Igniting go to mages first, then warlocks once the mages have theirs.
---
Can you explain the backdoor Part
---
They have been conditioned to grind a number for enjoyment. Not actually playing the game.
---
&gt; forcefully change the battleground to non-vanilla a
---
No, they should change it to the version that lasted the most during vanilla, the version that everyone reminisce about, the version people talk and want when the topic is classic is on the table.
---
Actually everyone wins AV now. Alliance kill drek in 7 mins to get honor and rep, horde kill Bal and lieutenants to get equal honor and rep.
---
In cases like this, I wish their names weren‚Äôt blacked out so we would know to avoid.
---
They hit fairly hard, they're ranged but mobile, and have some good gear they can get.
---
Theyre not OP by any amount, but its moreso that rogues really arent good at 19. Their lack of talents into stealth means they're basically warriors without charge and less armor.
---
I was in a warlock in questing gear destroying 19 twink rogues in BGS on private servers because you could just dot them while theyre trying to sneak up on you because of how far away you can see rogues with rank 1 stealth without any stealth talents.
---
It‚Äôs easy to just up and leave a server when you‚Äôre solo. However I have a guild that I‚Äôve been with for nearly 2 years now on Herod. I wouldn‚Äôt be open to a transfer unless the guild was transferring too.
---
Most of the reason YOU play battlegrounds is the reward. 
---
I personally like AV and AB for the sake of them, and would like WSG if the pre-made dominance has almost always (even in vanilla) made it too consistently boring for me. And tbh, I think that there's probably close to 50% of people in AV that feel the same, but of that group some aren't willing to just go with the flow because the meta is gonna be ruined by people who just want the rewards, anyways, so there's no point in trying to play the BG.
---
It always makes me giggle when people say WSG is the best way to get honor.
---
lmao 2019 is all about efficiency, only boomers play for fun!
---
This is not true. The only feature removed was the, "Send who request on mouse clicks in interface" -- the other feature of, "Send who request on mouse clicks in world" still works and is still sufficient to not need manual scans.
---
In regards to OP's post of, "You got to manually click (anywhere) every 8-10 seconds for it to run it" -- that is true, however I do not see how that makes the data inaccurate. The data itself is perfectly accurate, it just took longer to scan, and if some people logged off during that scan, they will be caught another time.
---
I am an avid user of Census+ and upload my data to [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com) every other day. The data that I upload does appear to provide a clear picture of how the Alliance are performing against the Horde. There's no other website that can possibly have as good and clean of data as Census+, and the fact is that Wowhead's stats came from the old site, [wowpop.appspot.com](https://wowpop.appspot.com/) which took Census+ data ([wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com) was down at that time).
---
I REPEAT: Census+ data is ACCURATE and the HEALTHIEST data you can get, short of Blizzard telling us the actual numbers.
---
how did you get up there?
---
Now you want to cast rejuvs with that pathetic mana pool? So you can shift twice... Lol
---
Any class is going to work just fine 95% of the time since you're most likely not playing full twink vs twink games. But the Druid toolkit before level 20 is downright pathetic. Not fun or worthwhile to invest in if you want to actually be competitive.
---
The issue of "No Changes" stems from the idea that people don't trust blizzard in general to fuck with the game in any way at all. Meaning they understand there are massive and multiple issues but many are willing to forgive them and play it despite them. However you have those that love classic but know that it isn't a perfect game that **Do** want some changes. This however might have a 3rd party effect on how it changes the game. 
---
A good example of this is how much a population effect WPVP so much. It made the game unplayable due to people desperately trying to rank honor for the awards, then when BGs come out you get literally hours worth of farming in a few minutes after a few AV runs.
---
Another example of how the changes crowd changed the game was Spy. Spy was an addon that by nature could have existed in classic perfectly fine, and it did. However because of people disliking spy so much they changed the range of Battle Logs, literally breaking things like Details/Recount, Logs, enemy player UIs (Used in BGs to see what the enemy team is and how many), as well as things like in general being able to target far distant targets. 
---
Both sides of the "No Changes" and "Some Changes" crowd have effect classic drastically already and even Blizzard themselves have messed with Classic drastically (Specifically the server limits) that "no changes" only stems from people really saying "No more changes"
---
Fuck off.
---
Lol runescape model I‚Äôd a joke.
---
Why would I be mad? Just saying the truth out
---
I do want it, just like I want lvl 55 water. But if we want a classic experience, I don't think it should have been in the game in phase 1. The classic experience is pallys manual buffing the raid.
---
Think it's a "3, 2, 1, GO" on Discord.
---
Gotcha. Totally agree with you there, although I actually am not sure if Blizz had or has the foresight to truly realize what seems to be obvious to the players (that AV is far superior to every option for gaining honor and therefor 90%+ of pvp is now going to be people zerging in AV for maximum honor/rep gains)
---
Classic continues to be an experiment on Blizz's part where they are picking and choosing which things from Vanilla to release, and at what time. 
---
Even the fact that it's complete cross-realm AV is such a bizarre decision for them to have made...
---
&gt; Because a dkp system with some modifications can do the same as loot council.
---
I hear what you're saying, but every choice you regulate away from the player is a step towards loot council, and every choice you *allow* the player is an opportunity to choose poorly. 
---
&gt; But a good dkp system is less prone to abuse and human error because it is more impartial and relies on tangible things (attendance) instead of more vague things like officers deciding who deserves items because they put in more effort, would be a better upgrade or whatever.
---
A lot of those less tangible things are incredibly important, though. I think what it really comes down to is whether you're optimizing for the guild/raid or the individual member. Individuals can sometimes get less fair results, but they're *supposed* to. Groups get stronger when the best people are applying human intelligence to optimize for long term success.
---
&gt; and makes people happier because the items are given away by a system
---
I can only speak from personal experience, but I've seen far more people unhappy with systems than with decisions made by good people. The vast majority of the raid should be agreeing with each loot council decision. There shouldn't be any handwaving "just trust us" stuff going on, it should be transparent and obvious to everyone why one person was chosen over another. 
---
&gt; they feel less mad when they dont get stuff.
---
This is just a recruitment issue, in my opinion. Guilds need to find people who understand that a stronger raid means more loot overall. Players who just want short-term loot at the expense of raid strength aren't ideal team members.
---
I always do this with Jaina's locket on live. Whenever the lock summon a closet, i put a portal to old Dal right next to it. People fall for it every damn time.
---
you'll actually be able to breathe and get some of that small spontaneous 1v1 wpvp that people actually want, like fighting over a thorium
---
The interesting thing is that due to many changes that are just the current reality, the game would need to change in order to preserve the old spirit.
---
I had quite a few times yesterday where a single horde would jump into the conga line of ally mounts, and not a single person would even bother to stop and kill them.
---
Yeah I've seen people selling loot runs for MC for 300 gold entrance. Sorry, I'm not paying 300 gold to enter an instance where loot for me may or may not drop. I'll find a pug and take my chances against other people, or a guild that fits my time slot.
---
If you pay for end game gear, you're fucking stupid.
---
It's an optional feature so it doesn't change the game at all if you don't use it. I don't understand the sentiment that removing the requirement to essentially stop playing the game while you wait for your group to form makes the game worse.
---
Dude I played AV in vanilla. It wasn't any different. The only difference is we would stop to cap turrets. So each game would last 12 minutes vs 7.  If you think zerging av is something new then I don't know.
---
Stop crying. I am having the best time of my life, as is everyone I played with in 2005.
---
Yea, I wasn't really thinking about what the actual options would be, for Class Balance probably something like:
---
"Would you rather see balance changes made to:
---
A. Talent Trees
---
B. Spells/Abilities
---
C. Class Sets / Class Items
---
D. None of the above"
---
&gt;your opinion is just your personal opinion
---
&gt;my opinion is supported by close to 50% of the playerbase, a statistic pulled from my ass
---
My group of 3 couldn't get that to work a single time let alone consistently with 5 people.
---
But this ring is a pvp reward..
---
it is, if no one is in range you are the only one that sees it
---
happens in a party as well if your buddy runs to far away
---
K welcome to my blacklist too
---
What's the point of WSG if you get more honor from AV? Why cant we make the honor per hour for both about equal?
---
Humans get a 10 percent rep buff as well as the bonus hon u get from the tokens most ally raiders will be done by the weekend as my battle group ally won 99 percent of base races and then people will play for hon instead of just rep.
---
so, why not just quit and play retail? I'll continue to have fun with classic
---
It absolutely implies that there are more subscribers for Classic than retail.
---
You can plead devils advocate if it makes you feel better. Since it clearly does for some reason. 
---
As someone that still logs into both, and was Mythic raiding in retail until Classic, it‚Äôs very obvious which game has more subs. It‚Äôs absolutely not retail.
---
You are obviously completely fucking confused about the word fulfillment and what I‚Äôm even talking about.  Wealth is not fulfillment, nor is it happiness, nor did I even bring up success at fucking all?  Unless you actually try to understand how fulfillment in life can be difficult to attain by playing 8+ hours a day for years straight, then don‚Äôt bother replying.  I‚Äôm
---
Completely uninterested in continuing this conversation with you if that‚Äôs the attitude and algebra you‚Äôre going to take with me.
---
That's the rank grind in a nutshell. Any grind that requires months of 16+ hour days to hit is going to have a prevalent method with nothing else comparing. This was true for WPvP and of course it would be true for BGs.  
---
You can still easily hit rank 11 via grinding WSG or AB. If you're aiming for higher than that, then deal with the system and make use of the best methods.
---
Hope your rag group onshots rag lol a wipe and delete
---
But he didn't use Kanye West, just Kanye.
---
Paul McCartney is The Paul McCartney, but Paul is just Paul. And if I saw Paul in WoW, I would not think "Aaah, that MUST be Paul McCartney".
---
Same with Britney Spears vs Britney.
---
Are we not talking about class balance in Arena representation here? I mean, there are all kinds of flag runners in WSG but we can all agree Druids are best at it, right? Would you say that WSG has a diverse flag runner pool?
---
Classic is 1.12, not 1.5.
---
Different strokes for different folks! I think the class really started to shine in TBC, so I think you‚Äôre right about its impact in vanilla. Jack of all trades, master of none.
---
To be honest, I thought this was a troll attempt at getting people removed from the instance by typing "/afk"
---
The message I typically see is "X has reported you AFK. Type /afk to remove this.." or something along those lines. I've always ignored it and haven't gotten kicked. 
---
Are you sure people aren't just falling for this trick?
---
The private servers were an almost perfect roadmap for classic wow.  They should have just copied them.  The game isn't 1.12, it's a hybrid of a bunch of different patches.
---
Why AV is the meta right now is no one wants to play it. You need to play AV right now for the queue times. In the future they will be much much longer so your rep per hour will drop significantly. Most people will be exalted by the weekend and the queues are going to go up because most people will want to queue for WSG. Sure AV will still be more honor, but this version of AV sucks, no Black Lotus, no start. Leave it to the no lifers who are ranking and the try hards thinking they are ranking.
---
There was never a "fun version". It was cool summoning the bosses atleast once. But av was always an awful pve battleground.
---
Just because my own faction suckass doesn't mean I'm not a pro leet player
---
tbh I still love retail, and I also love classic. I don't see why people (on both sides) think you have to hate one to like the other. I play retail for the destination, I play classic for the journey. Mechanically, retail is miles ahead of classic, but classic has that almost d&amp;d game feel, which I absolutely love.
---
Who the hell is talking about wPvP? You're building straw men.
---
Thanks mate have a lovely day. :)
---
Anything above (and including) sungrass usually does pretty decent. Especially mountain silversage, dreamfoil, and plaguebloom. NOT arthas' tears. fuck arthas' tears.
---
The first 24 levels of druid are very yawn tastic.  Stand and attack and put thorns on yourself every 10 minutes.  It's not the most enjoyable.  After 16 hours you get a combo point system with cat form and you can build up combo points and see how many you can get stacked before the mobs die to your cat's auto attacks.  I'm just warning you the first bit of druid leveling is very, extremely dull.  More so than any of the other 8 classes I've played to 20.
---
My buddy had a parody of this back in the day he wanted to make called Mighty Morphine Power Rangers vs Teenage Ninja Mutants. Maybe one day...
---
I Just added Mr. Smite to the illustration! Check it out! [Mr.Smite](https://www.patreon.com/posts/deadmines-32263219)
---
The people doing this should get a 1 week ban and full honor reset to rank 0.
---
Most of the quests can be finished without a turtle. There are quests to assault a bunker, assault a graveyard, claim a mine. Those all grant experience and can be done within a 6 minute game (the mine one is probably the most difficult). There are two quests for gathering 10 mine supplies and returning them. This quest gives no experience. You'll also get experience for every 3 AV tokens you hand in (you get 1 per loss and 3 per win. 
---
The rams, wolves, kobolds and harpies all give experience, but it will be dramatically reduced based on how many people are nearby you. I killed a few wolves and got between 50 and 250 experience per kill depending on if anyone was near me.  Kobolds have very low health and give very low experience.
---
Long answer is yes, you can earn exp in AV. Realistically, you'll probably get an additional ~5000 experience per hour of AV, while being absolutely useless to your team.
---
The sound quality is also 15 years old for the true vanilla experience.
---
Exactly lol. Trials are gonna be showered in tier gear. We have trials come in and get 3 piece in 1 raid. But if a fucking Deathbringer drops for the first time in 3 months, hell naw i don't want to roll that shit off to random people who I've seen for the first time.
---
Pally Power can be used in 5-mans and tracks buffs just fine. You shouldn't need two different addons.
---
Max rank you can get for the first few weeks is 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14.
---
and then people would bitch about it taking too long and they can't insta-grind for their pretty little trinkets and new armor with +1 strength.
---
Soulstone might be allowed, as it is akin to a phylactery in being applied prior to death.  And given the long cooldown and need for a warlock, if you aren't one already, it gives a little help but not massive amounts.
---
The other thing you might want to consider is telling your group members (or not) about your permadeath.  Granted, your character won't be around for them to bitch out for leaving mid run.
---
Can you rebind "open keyring"?
---
pretty standard practice, we used one in vanilla to get our PVP group into the same AV, normally 15-20 people. but we also used it for nearly a full 40
---
You can't group queue av through blizzard means, you have to just get lucky
---
No, it‚Äôs just like in GTA online if enough people vote to kick the person gets kicked even if they have done nothing wrong - the report system is flawed because it‚Äôs based on the number of people saying ‚Äúthis guy is afk‚Äù but the system just flags them as AFK and kicks them without figuring out whether or not they‚Äôre actually AFK.
---
I dislike you.
---
Oh no, a hunter complaining about lack of loot from MC.
---
Agree, AV is basically an honor club right now, not a pvp bg. 
---
I expect they will buff the mobs in AV before long.
---
A more interesting question, are you feeling okay that you knowingly prey on those type of people for your enjoyment? Is everything alright with you? Want to talk to someone? Do you not get the same joy from just joking around with people at your same level of competence?
---
That's actually a solid idea.  One would need a discord for this, both factions and its possible.
---
Yes, everyone, PLEASE DO NOT PLAY THE GAME HOW YOU LIKE TO. OP is sending you sub money for a good reason so he can be rank 14 and show off his big dick PURPLES.
---
Explain artificial batching then. And no, it‚Äôs not the same as Vanilla
---
In an ideal world you‚Äôll have onslaught as well, which‚Äôll bring you up to 6.
---
Ultimately, I totally agree‚Äîthe difference is gonna be minuscule, if even noticeable with a 0.1% miss chance
---
Sounds hard, but in practice everyone has basically the same list and you only need to prio on spec and classes and a few specials.
---
Nice1
---
lol why?
---
He was getting his main shammy Druid and rogue mixed up
---
I wish I could find a raid day.
---
People are too sweaty and I can't stand them.
---
Blizzard has only shit left in their heads.
---
Let the guy enjoy something, you gotta have some time in your life, for fun.
---
Interesting. So it's not worthless to keep farming AV, as that will help rank up for future ranks?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
*you are
---
Yes. No one ever said that and I never typed /afk. This is the debuff you get from being reported Away by enough people. When the debuff expires, you get kicked. Entering PvP combat removes the debuff, but no one did while running toward the Horde base
---
Your name fits pretty well to be honest
---

If you have X number of subscribers for retail, the increase in classic has to be MORE.  And we don't know what the current actual subscription numbers are, and we don't know how many joined Classic.  You want to just randomly believe in things without facts then suit yourself.  Just because there was a higher number returning to Classic than past expansions doesn't give any actual fact that Classic out numbers Retail subscribers.  At all.  Believe whatever you want, but it's all just guessing
---
But still works exactly like wow and looks like wow because it is wow
---
That and making it some some enchants couldn't be used anymore etc..      blizz killed thinking by design.   It was a sad day.   One of.the main reasons I and even subscribe d to classic is for twinking.and after yesterday in so fucking stoked.
---
Which class you gonna pick?
---
I would suck mondo dong for us to get OSRS style polls after Phase 6.
---
OSRS is a perfect example of how to modernise an MMO without hyper-casualising it.
---
Depends how much honor you earn in comparison to the other players on your faction.
---
You will be given a standing at the end of the week and placed in a bracket. Bracket 1 is for the highest honor earners and it will give you 12-13k RP gain.
---
It‚Äôs possible to skip multiple ranks if you get enough RP. Which is easier to do at lower ranks with less decay. 
---
Example:
---
Week 1: top few brackets can go from rank 0 to rank 4
---
AV lasting sub 10 minutes is a very sad thing to see.
---
Of course he wasn't. Your response makes my point.
---
Some people already have.
---
Lol, you just made my case. I‚Äôm walking back and forth in Darkshore now and it‚Äôs not at all a bridge too far. Also, there‚Äôs a FP in GOLDSHIRE for fuck‚Äôs sake. That has nothing at all to do with changes from Cataclysm. 
---
I‚Äôm not arguing with you and I‚Äôm not gonna call you names, this isn‚Äôt that important. 
---
But while I was painting with broad strokes to make a point, I think the real problem was with Execs. Execs at any company want to appeal to the broadest base possible to make the most money. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they don‚Äôt understand the model, or what made things great in the first place. Some fat kid on the forums doesnt want to walk to Goldshire? ‚ÄúJuSt pUt a FP THerE! i‚ÄôM SO SmArT‚Äù says the Exec.
---
He thinks he fixed the game due to his l33t problem-solving skills. But he doesn‚Äôt understand the game at all and just chipped away at players having to earn anything, because money.
---
And as always happens in this case, retail went from 10 million active players to a number small enough that they‚Äôre now too embarrassed to release. 
---
Please note: I didn‚Äôt cite this as fact, but I work at a corporation and this is exactly how Execs think/work. Then they play golf.
---
I totally agree. In my opinion the worst thing to happen to gaming since original Vanilla is meta culture. The idea that *this* is the *only* way to play and *anything* else is **wrong** and **completely nonviable**.
---
None of it works because most anyone with any skill can see the name of the spell being cast and not get tricked by an animation. Not that I pay attention to animation anyway, the castbar is my friend.
---
Our loot council is the opposite. If your gear isn't pre-bis or enchanted, the guy who has it will get the upgrade. Rewards hard work instead of feeding gear to people in greens
---
That's not my money, but my time. Additionally, I use adblock so they're not getting a penny from me.
---
I think this is the right response.  Right now the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù players are rushing honor and if you‚Äôre not with them then you are just in their way.  
---
It will smooth out.  Just need to give it some time and let them do their thing.  In a couple months AV should be more fun for the causal player.
---
I bet he has no idea how that happened too lol
---
I don't know why you keep saying things you obviously don't know anything about. Druids are the best fc's and they will get better once +22 int enchants are available. If you want to be competitive as dps, you roll hunter or rogue. If you want to FC, you roll druid. The HP advantage and being able to shift out of snares is what does it. I'm sorry that you don't see that but I guarantee you'll regret choosing a warrior. They are not good at this bracket.
---
The real issue is that the classic PvP reward system is garbage. Almost nobody actually likes it. 
---
Personally I liked the BC arena reward system.
---
Typically the next day. This one is now available, and with Mr. Smite included!
---
You clearly you lovely day too you.
---
I'm fine with undercuting as long as it's just a few  copper, but people do it so aggressively that they drive the value of their product down. Shooting themselves (and everyone else) in the foot.
---
**Bilzard has sex leg**
---
I think you need to re-read what happened here.  I wasn't criticizing that guy for not knowing what AV is - I was criticizing him for dismissing the OP's concerns regarding AV, and then immediately turning around and admitting that he doesn't even know what AV is.    
---
I await your apology.
---
Yeah that fear didnt happen until tbc. But i mean, you gotta give warlocks something, let them have their fear, they dont have anything else.
---
Long AVs were the norm when it first came out. This was reduced by Blizzard changing the number of guards and their respawn timers IIRC.
---
Being under level 60 with a slow mount in AV is like playing a survival horror.
---
/clap
---
The blue set isn't even in the game and won't be for a long time.
---
No, most of us understood what it meant from top to bottom. You're saying Brack was right.
---
If they quit after things didn‚Äôt go their way for 30 minutes, Classic was never for them.
---
the comment I made is basically verbatim what he said as he was being criticized for ninja looting.
---
Hindsight, etc, but you could have shelved the account, lapsed the sub, and made a new account so that your other character would still be available later.
---
Actually, it's rep I want.  But horde is mostly taking a high honor, low rep approach to AV right now. 
---
I want us to actually win so I can get out of AV and leave it to the honor grinders.
---
But getting more honor like this is useless as you only compete with your own faction. (If everyone gets more honor) so the only thing that matters is the alliance rep bonus which makes it way easier.)
---
Yeah, the epic set should have been changed dynamically over the patches. Now players will have gear good enough for naxx before AQ.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs probably mostly true. One thing I love about Naxx is even with 40/40 in bis gear, 4H and KT are still hard fights that rely on perfect execution. Not being able to face roll the content makes it so much more rewarding imo.
---
Icecrown and Storm Peaks were phenomenal aesthetically/visually with flying. Flying turned me off the second it was put into Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor. Cata imo only had negative effects on the game as a whole. But, that‚Äôs my opinion
---
&gt; personally, WotLK ruined the class fantasy of Prot Pally being a 'caster tank'. i know why they changed them to being str-based rather than int+sp but it still irked me then, and it would irk me now.
---
Did the Prot Pally rotation get an overhaul in WotLK or something, or are you just talking about using different stats on gear?
---
Hunter, I am live now.. forgot to add my twitch link lol
---
Definitely
---
That is what house is doing atm.

Why not use Questie?
---
dalsons tears? :P
---
you disgust me, get out of my office
---
did you see a warrior tanking with 2 weapons? me neither go muscle that shield buddy and enjoy the journey
---
People would have figured it out very quickly, without private servers, dissemination of information is way faster now.
---
Also back when WoW first came out no one had the luxury if talent trees and player balance being the same for its entire run. I would say 1.12 is the "best" iteration of vanilla wow character balance, but before 1.12 there were times when certain character builds were more/less viable. 
---
Part of the reason MC is so easy is that we are using 1.12 talents. It wasn't as easy when it first came out and there was less balance amongst classes. 
---
It would be interesting to play WoW in its earlier iteration released to the public, but with the iteration, there would be no need for entire classes of characters/specs. Or at least even less need than there is now.
---
Well, there's your problem. Shoulda been in mid farming honour. /s
---
Or for people who struggle to gear one, let alone TWO max level characters... Time commitment, etc etc. Because at some point what's the difference between a twink and a Naxxx-geared player dunking on someone who doesn't raid? 
---
Twinks that exclusively target the guy in white gear are shit-tier, sure. And maybe that's most of them, idk, I've never really spent a shit-load of time in the twink meta. Although I'm curious about it this run around because I'd like to gear up a flag-runner for WSG, but can't commit the time for a max-level one.
---
You level with 2h, using arms spec. And then you switch over to sword and board when tanking.
---
Blizzcon 2018 if I'm remembering correctly during the WoW classic panel.
---
because spell pen was not added to 1.9 
---
there is a blue post about this
---
Time is money, friend.
---
Let em bitch.  They bitch about everything else.  Are people bitching about the WSG rep grind?
---
Why do Alliance win most of the AV‚Äôs?  Is there something about the map?  Thanks
---
listen, warmaster laggrond said these gnolls in a cave to the south pose a threat to the frostwolf clan  
---
ImDoingMyPart.jpg
---
Update your atlas loot. It hasn‚Äôt showed that for quite some time.
---
I do agree with that, which is why I think they should call it ‚ÄúRRRRRAAAAAAIIIIIIDDDDD!!!!! - *inspired* by World of Warcraft‚Äù.
---
3300 per turnin of your 3 tokens. If you have quick matches like I experienced last night, I got probably 70% of an entire level (at 57)... Not bad at all and already Honored.
---
But still very classist.
---
Could fix AV by just making the War Masters (pretty sure that's their name?) more deadly, and not able to pull the out of the keep, or hell give them weapon chains so they can't be disarmed. It's clear the War Masters were added to force teams to want to ACTUALLY take out other towers and bases (to the point where trying to kill the Stormpike/Drek is a big Risk with even 1 Warmaster alive). It is absurd that Alliance can just rush down, pull the warmasters out 1 by 1, and face roll the match in 8 minutes. I like the fact that towers like Tower Point have an elite in order to prevent 1 player from being able to easily cap a tower, and even can make it difficult for two if you don't work together, and the War Master's should be the equivalent but powerful enough to prevent a 40 man raid from being able to EASILY take them out.
---
Was 10-15 min last night for WSG in US East
---
I believe it's 640g
---
&gt; violating the licensing of the addon and the copyright of the author
---
as if that were at all enforceable, goodluck with that.
---
The main thing that would keep this from working is the use of custom chat channels which blizzard just broke addons from using so...
---
Just to chime in/add in a little Alliance is also seemingly random on what kind of group you get. Some only care about winning fast for rep and do so successfully, some try to rush but fail and end up pseudo-turtling, and very few have a galv/lieutenant hit squad, since people finally figured out that thats where the honor is. As group 3 rises it'll also affect horde's randomness as well, as some of the bonus honor from surviving lieutenants now vanishes.
---
You have to play every waking hour for months to get rank 14. If you stop playing because you think you‚Äôve played enough, you won‚Äôt get it.
---
hehehe...fap potion, heh
---
More like alliance get to Drek faster than we can to Vanndar. 
---
Horde started killing Bal/LTs when they realized that. 
---
I've never played on pservers, butI keep hearing horde used a "backdoor" on pservers to overcome this.  (Pservers then put mines to stop this?)
---
So if this is true, I would assume until horde start to use the back door, alliance will typically win AVs.
---
I'm not totally sure, but i think you can only carry a limited amount.
---
When it comes to rep i just hand them in since im only doing it for epix
---
I would also like to know this
---
And there are no server with 100 alliance total.
---
It's a greatly exaggerated point I am trying to make.
---
Take that "dead" server as an example tho. When all the alliance left it, the few remaining will have a much easier time reaching r14 compared to the huge servers with more people competing.
---
So they get to play in a PVE server while having the same access to AV as everyone else, with longer queues than alliance, and having to eventually pay money to leave the server?  
---
I dunno, doesn't really sound like a win to me.
---
I haven't had a match last less than 20 minutes so far. Maybe I've just been unlucky/lucky (depending on perception) though.
---
I do sell solid stone in the auction house pretty reliably.
---
once you capped the GraveYard it takes several minutes to tag it for your faction. the guy basicly tells that's a waste of time. And if Horde caps SH GY, it mostly pushes all the alliance back, therefore increased resistance.
---
Agreed. I love all the spells and how they interact with one another. 
---
However, there are definitely some numbers I would tweak with damage, CC/dot durations, etc. But that would probably go hand-in-hand with talent tree rebalance.
---
I don't want new abilities, but new talents could be cool as long as they dont veer TOO far off the original path.
---
You can macro your pickpocket ability to your openers and do both at the same time. I'll also pickpocket mobs before opening in dungeons. over time it adds up and definitely helps.
---
Just make it so you cannot kill the Marshals until the tower falls. Problem solved.
---
So those people look down on also have people they look down on, interesting.
---
Also you needed korak to get IBS, who only spawned after 1h so people would intentionally cause turtles.
---
That's the one.
---
Turn in your marks, if you‚Äôre grinding to exalted, you‚Äôll get a lot. Max you can hold is 20, making it more valuable to turn them in now. 
---
They are more valuable on AV Weekend, but it‚Äôs not known when that will be.
---
What shade of rouge are you?
---
I don't think you know what a strawman means friend, might want to learn how to argue before using such terms.
---
I'll third this, PvE seems to have a more friendly community. I will say that the skill level seems a bit lower as well, but it hasn't been too bad. As everyone says, the game is pretty easy and doesn't need to be min/maxed.
---
Alliance cba to pvp when there's PVE to be had
---
Except anyone saying it works for Classic is bullshit because Blizzard broke addons from using custom chat channels, which the unmodified version of this addon relies upon.
---
I mean we got rank 14 caster weaps early so
---
It‚Äôs not just AV it‚Äôs also in WSG
---
For all these people obsessing about PvP for weeks now, none of them seem to actually enjoy PvP.
---
It's kinda sad.
---
RAS syndrome
---
Classic almost certainly has more players than BfA.  Based on the claim that it was the largest increase ever, and the fact that TBC added 3 million subs over vanilla(time frame is unclear, as TBC grew throughout, unlikely they were all added at launch) it is fairly safe to assume 1.5-2 million new subs for classic.  
---
Blizzard leaked their BfA sub data through an API call, and WeakAuras gathered all the data, in October of last year BfA had 1.7 million active subs.  
---
Classic almost certainly had more than that at launch, all though how many of those are still around is hard to say.  It is certainly possible though that the classic playerbase is larger than retail currently.
---
a pair of mary's!
---
The point is that if you DON'T go for officers chances are that you'll lose anyway. Then you'll get a few hundreds of honor instead of the 2k you'd get from killing officers. Rushing gives you less honor compared to other horde players, so it's not "dumb as shit" to kill officers and Belinda.
---
With multiple targets attacking you you're relying a lot on your team to help out. But being able to root the melee snaring you is a huge tool that I feel you're overlooking completely in favor of extra armor - the only benefit a warrior has at that level.
---
I was the best. There's no award it was an undisputed fact. The twink community was always pretty close. I ran the largest twink guild on the battlegroup &lt;We Kill People&gt; and we often ran premades and competed against other twinks in BGs and, eventually, arenas. It was not the most competitive battlegroup so I'm not claiming I was the best 19 twink around, I only say this to let you know I have experience in that fairly niche part of the game.
---
Depends... Using Soul Stones count as death too?
---
no, you just didn't understand the context.
---
those 'lost' mean I got in a high-honor game, which is good.
---
what the alliance do is of little concern to me, as long as the game over after 7-8 min.
---
Is it? I think it's a great model. No changes unless voted on. Something I can get behind.
---
Even if ally win, everybody wins if it ends quickly. Turning it into a turtle, everyone loses
---
There is a terrain jump you can do to skip the bridge/bunkers to the alliance base.

I remember them getting mailed to you if you went over cap.
---
"enjoy never contracting aids w us, bitch"
---
You can only hold 20 in your inventory, but you still get the excess mailed to you.
---
&gt; you don't know a damn thing about me or what I like to do for fun
---
This is pretty funny coming from the guy who declared what twink players like to do for fun.
---
If your hearthstone is on CD, you can do the same thing with the Thalendris seed backpack. Same animation. Do gotta keep the backpack and a coupla soil on your to do this, but it opens up fakery when you've recently hearthed. Other limitations still apply.
---
Lol, I haven't logged into retail in over 10 years and nothing will make me again god bless Classic monnnn
---
No matter what direction you take (and you should always take the DPS gear route when it comes to anything pre-Raid), capping your hit is your utmost priority, nothing else matters unless you're hit capped.
---
The only reason you'd want to go deep mitigation is if you have an off-tanking role in raids.
---
The interesting thing is I've never seen twinks address this point.
---
It's always that it is actually fine because everyone else is playing a twink anyway and if it's not that it's lazily likening twinking to being someone well geared at level 60.
---
Twink accounts also lock off the best loot from new players who can't afford it at the inflated prices. I also don't need anyone replying to this point that doesn't understand how a new player won't have the same amount of gold as an established account.
---
isn't everything just set to 1.12? so it would make sense for them to just stick to the 1.12 version since that's the overall content patch that people wanted?
---
I am making tons of gold on my level 39 Druid with 300 alchemy. Way more than my 60 Warrior. 
---
The easiest way is to flip cheap herbs into potions/elixirs. I highly recommend the Auctioneer app as it will tell you what percentage the price is relative to the "market price". So I'll search for the herbs for common raid consumables and buy them when they drop to 90% or below of the market price, which is fairly common on my server. 
---
The other trick is to not sell right away, but when things are in high demand, e.g. right before raids. So Mon-Thurs around 6-8 PM could be a really hot time (but I don't know your server for sure). 
---
Making money in alchemy is all about quantity with slim profit margins, but it's steady and reliable. Superior Mana Potions and Elixir of Mongoose have been my best sellers. The mana pots are usually 30-50 silver of profit per stack of 5 and Mongoose are closer to 1g/stack. Not a lot short term, but it adds up if you put the effort in. 
---
Also, flipping Arcane Crystals into Arcanite Bars is better than trying to sell your transmute. I usually make about 6-7g each bar y buying the Crystals when they're cheap on the AH. Make sure you only list the Arcanite Bar for 2 hours - it keeps the deposit low (only 2s, 50c) and there is a steady supply of Arcanite Bars where everyone is undercutting the next in line, so you want to be at the top for the rare chance that they sell. 
---
I've been doing this for about 2 weeks now, once my Druid hit level 35. I had about 30g on my character at the time. I am well over 250g and I have probably 10-15 stacks of expensive herbs in my bank waiting to convert into potions/elixirs. All by buying/selling on the AH.
---
perhaps people play the game to you know... play the game? where this isn't a means to the fastest possible rep/honor for them. just a consideration for ya.
---
Hell ya! Maybe ill get exaulted and buy it this weekend
---
Lol if you're going down that route BFA has metric fuckloads of stuff to do.
---
The problem with this is that it requires players to play for fun instead of playing to minmax, which people don't seem to do anymore. 8 hour AVs are awful for honor in the same way that huge battles in southshore are bad for honor. You get little honor per player, diminishing returns come quickly so soon you get no honor per player and its 8 hours between when you get honor for the actual match  which isn't a ton (assuming you don't leave beforehand because it's 8 hours).
---
While not 8 hours long you can still have longer hour or two AVs with the current system and they're a ton of fun with plenty of actual pvp. It tends to happen if there one side wipes and then the other turtles. Whenever it happens you get a bunch of people complaining though because they aren't there to maximize fun, they are their to maximize honor.
---
Even if we went back to the older versions where 8h+ games happened in vanilla, I kind of doubt that would happen now because the meta has changed and the players have changed.
---
It's official this sub has become the same as retail, just self promoting and whining, the content is thrash, the game's gone.
---
Bring two stacks of mongoose elixir, and 5x fire protection potions
---
Can you remind me on the backdoor strat? I haven't played av in 13 years and I cant remember what I had for breakfast.
---
How does "block" work, what does the block number on a shield mean. Higher the better, clearly, but what's it all about?
---
What does the block number translate to? How much more is a 5 block going to prevent an attack as oppose to 7 block or 22 block value?
---
I don't think that would happen any more. The meat grinder version is  awful for honor. You get little honor per player due to the raid and the honor that you do get goes through diminishing returns very quickly. We would have a week or two of meatgrinder AVs if that then they would vanish and people would either find a new strategy or stop doing AV, similar to how the tauren mill / southshore meatgrinder stopped about a week after the release of honor in favor of roving death squads. You can bring back the old patches, but you can‚Äôt bring back the old meta and playstyle that went along with them.
---
Since they are not apart of my class, I guess not.. I haven't fully decided on rules yet but for now I'm going to say no
---
If they aren't playing for loot they should probably go play retail or something. Nothing in classic is fun or challenging on it's own without rewards
---
yep, some people don't love mmorpgs, good thing games like retail, PoE and LoL exist for them
---
Propably a lot easier in the off hours when there isn't like a new game opening every second.
---
Lol I‚Äôm making a joke poking fun at a lot of the ppl on this sub. I believe you
---
Oh, the humanity.....
---
I have Bagnon and this doesn't work, it just opens my bags.
---
I was always a Rogue... tried some range but it just felt off. If you want more of the same but a bit more versatile go warrior. If you want a more hybrid class roll Shaman.
---
If you choose to level a feral druid you still have the stealth and a sort of melee, but I didn‚Äôt want to stare at a beast 75% of the time.
---
Fyi: I am a Paladin now with a Rogue and Warrior alt!
---
&gt; You‚Äôre not making a lot of sense, here.
---
Says the guy who doesn't play pvp *or* enjoy the games story.
---
are you under the impression that was acceptable 15 years ago too?
---
backcapping , maybe...
---
4-5 mage AE bombing on a vann/drekk attempt maybe...
---
twiddling your thumb in a tower ''defending'' something people might not even cap... or doing the random quests in AV... wasn't considered as active participation either.
---
You're right, I regret making the statement so broad.  But there is absolutely a subset of the twink community that loves to shit on non-twinks.  How big this subset is?  Who knows, but you're delusional if you think that it doesn't exist.
---
You can only carry 20 at a time, then the excess show up in your mailbox.
---
Yo dawg - we heard you like pvp &amp; breakdancing.
---
The thing I don't like about "no changes" is that there is already a lot of changes. So we get this weird middle ground of changing some things, but not others.
---
Nerves got a chance to say thank you for the detailed break down! Saved this comment for the next time I head back into brd. Gonna start to retrain my muscle memory not to use rend on charge.
---
Question though: when switching to zerk stance for the ww, when is the optimal time to weave in beserker rage? I‚Äôm assuming you want as many mobs alive and hitting you in order to take advantage of extra rage generation , so right away is probably optimal, but would you ever do a quick stance swap (since you have tactical mastery) after you charge in to use beserker rage? That way, 100% of mobs are hitting you before one potentially gets peeled off due to aggro loss.  Or is that sub optimal? Would you ever do it before the pull or do you lose out on rage due to the time it takes you to dive in there?
---
Thanks again!
---
Gromsblood, ice cap, and of course black lotus as well
---
It's not Vanilla, it's Classic. Aka retail/pserver mentality with mixed old content.
---
Shit basically.
---
I play both but if you think Classic has an "ungodly amount of content compared to retail" you are delusional, most people I know log on just for raid or to level alts when super bored, world quests and dailies might be boring but at least it gives you something to do, when it's not raid time I have NO reason to log on to my main.
---
The last aspect is the main problem. 
---
With fewer rewards other playstyles and modes would be more viable. 
---
Warsong is actually pretty nice. But it has long ques cause it has low rewards even if you play perfect.
---
Not really, it just resulted in lots of standing around.  I played the shit out of AV in vanilla and before you could zerg everyone would just cap the towers and graveyards and 2-5 people would stand at them so the solo rogues trying to ninja cap couldn't.  Then when the towers went down and the final GY capped you would kill the boss.  
---
There really wasn't a ton of PvP once it was figured out that that was the best way to play it back then.  Then they changed it to 1.12 and the zergs got more aggressive, reducing times from 15-20 minutes to 6-8 minutes, but with pretty much the same PvP engagement.  
---
It did occasionally result in roaming groups of 5-10 trying to recap and forcing some fights, but those were no more often they they happen now, which causes the turtles and the longer games. 10-15% of the time maybe.
---
Under the impression playing objectives in an objective based BG was okey. Guess not since community just want to rush shit for maximum efficiency...
---
OP is on stalagg. Your "point" isn't relevant my dude, you're just trying to argue for some reason.
---
I'm not one of the people complaining and demanding change.
---
more rep only matter for the first what... 20 hour of AV?
---
once you're exhalted it doesn't mean anything.
---
Can someone please explain this to me?
---
Horde also takes a lot of rep too.
---
killing brackets
---
I can see the argument that this + enchant + spurs saves you a pretty insignificant amount of travel time while out questing.  But I‚Äôve lost enough AV‚Äôs while Van is at 1% to know that it matter.  Plus with autocarrot addon you don‚Äôt even have to think about it.
---
We are all stuck in one big Vsauce video
---
Well they don't need to they win anyways.
---
Fake News
---
Everyone keeps talking about this Stormpike backdoor that I've never heard of before. What backdoor is that?
---
Aha our main tank is a human, i'm a gnome, we do similar things. I mark myself always cause its the only way to find me at times. As a PvE'r, I wish I was a NE/Human, as a PvP'r, omg am I ever happy I'm a gnome.
---
I feel like everyone got hyped about dwarf priests. Hey they're cool, but like ...
---
Human Priests, get that like giant instant heal.
---
Undead priests also are the best shadow priests, extra dot to apply.
---
Fear ward in a raid, can't compete, PvP wise though ... Humans and Undead are as good if not better ;)
---
This is one of many reasons why Cross Realm is silly.
---
I hate when i Lip and then someone faps, can people stop fapping on my lips.
---
UBRS is the only dungeon usually ran as 10; other dungeons can also take 10 people but they're cleared as 5.
---
Anyone found out what addon is doing this? its not Details for me
---
People reported you for not zerging.
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about that. It seems to be some sort of downwards slide into the behavior.
---
Grilled squid I believe
---
You're right that you can't choose the target. That's why you cast it when you need it and NOT right when you step outside. But you make macros for this along with shift macros so you're rarely out of bear form. 
---
Look, I replied to you to be helpful but you are just digging your heels in. Have fun on your warrior.
---
Where can I find "Gloom'rel". In videos and on wowhead it says he's where all the other "'rels" are, but I couldn't find him?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9037/gloomrel
---
Maybe.
---
The change occurred because of the ‚Äústreamer industry‚Äù. Their reach and their influence over young gamers has led to this. It‚Äôs turned every multiplayer community into hot garbage. There may not be many, but the biggest assholes have the most influence, and people mimic the behavior en masse because they think it is what will make them successful.
---
I don't use Berserker Rage. Execution is the most important thing here. You will not have a problem holding aggro if you execute the above perfectly every single pull.
---
Adding extra, unnecessary abilities just leaves more room for error. You will have more rage than you can spend when multiple targets are attacking you.
---
If Heroic strike is queued, your off-hand white hits take your yellow hit cap.
---
Therefore if you have enough rage to sustain it, you can constantly have Heroic Strike on queue for your main-hand hit and your off-hand will never miss, assuming you're hit capped for yellow hits (9% or 6% with +5 weapon skill)
---
Grinding rep isn't necessarily constructive to improving PvP skill though, it's not practice in a sense that you're trying to improve your abilities. You're not testing combos, training against different matchups, or fine tuning your teamwork. Grinding rep is going to be running to the general and killing him. Take DotA for example. People have thousands of hours and stay in a middle bracket, and then some players come through and legitimately practice and flatten those other players in game.
---
Why
---
I don't use addons. I was hoping there was an in game way to do it without addons. If not, oh well.
---
Oh, yeah, no doubt.  There were 350+ games running simultaneously most of the night.
---
Completely different now. It's surreal really. I'm 55 (usually a prime target), and level 60 horde players just ride past me now instead of stopping to kill me.
---
It shows that people only care about honor and pvp rank. Now it's not worth their time to kill players in the open world when you can just run a 10 minute AV and get a shitload more honor and honor kills.
---
Zerg or get out.
---
Shift-click.
---
Great info, I think a big thing I‚Äôm missing is maximizing demo shouts threat by using it in d stance. Marking is something that should help as well, although less so in 5+ packs.
---
And once I get some decent phase 1/2 bis I‚Äôm thinking about going hybrid fury prot but I need the survivability first!
---
Heaven forbid people play the way they want with their $15.
---
someone at blizzard genuinely thought right click reporting was a good idea
---
UBRS is a 10 man raid. It can be done with less depending on the run type but usually 7-10
---
Oh we gon‚Äô definitely drop some hypotheticals on that ally‚Äôs clavicle. Cuz I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô ‚Äòbout TRRRSCH! SQUEEZT! SQUEEZT! SQUEEZT! SQUEEZT!
---
agreed.  I love how the game isn't just a copy of a game from 2005, its a modernization of the original game's implementation to reach both new/old fans of the genre/game.  It would be like Bethesda officially developing Morrowind with a 2019 game engine.
---
I N T E R F A C E A D D O N
---
He's referring to the fact that BG ques are still insanely quick for everybody- even Horde. Eventually that que is going to naturally go up and when it gets too unreasonable people are going to go back out and gank again.
---
lol I guess I‚Äôm still a young warrior as I never stopped using it. Thanks for teaching me otherwise!
---
Ok
---
the Org &gt; UC zeppelin master also tells you that casting fire spells while on board is strictly forbidden
---
Fight in mid??
---
discussion
---
Cross realm has nothing to do with it.  People can easily do this if BG's were server specific.
---
In general I agree that a lot of people weren't ready for pvp servers, that said I think this was an extreme version of the wpvp that existed before. In Vanilla the dominant side didn't camp capitals to the point of faction death.
---
I'm all for zerging but I just needed to pick up the fucking quest to get my poleram LOL
---
We alliance are definitely outnumbered on Kromcrush, but every other day or so a group of us lvl 40s band together and rush around STV killing horde.  Eventually they QQ enough that some horde 60s show up.  Sometimes they are arrogant enough to think a single 60 can solo 3+ lvl 40s and we get to kill a 60.  More often than not, a bunch of 60s show up and wreck us for a minute or two.  Then they leave and we go back to killing horde again.
---
But you probably still watch his streams. Weird.
---
The amount of damage your shield will block, your block rating is the % chance that your shield will block an attack. Shield block will increase your chances to block by 75% for 5 seconds and when you block you will block x amount of damage based on your block value
---
Next time you AV ask who the MT  and MH is, then group report them AFK. If they want to play this game then let‚Äôs give them a taste of their own medicine.
---
Hey guys just dinged lvl 10, I have 300g is that not good or?
---
Alliance has a distinct advantage in AV due to the map layout. It results in them winning a lot more matches when you try to play the same strategy as them.
---
This is the best idea I have ever heard.
---
&gt;That same logic could be used for like 90% of the game. ‚ÄúWhy should my equipment be ‚Äúgated‚Äù by the fact that I don‚Äôt have time to raid weekly?‚Äù Etc etc etc.
---
No the same logic doesnt apply, like at all.
---
Horde are starting to turtle now with 30 mins matches with the same rewards. After this, I tend to agree with you.
---
Well, you're a druid, so...you better have mark of the wild up. And you're going to have at least a little +int. Sure, your mana bar isn't amazing, but at 19, druids are definitely unusually effective at avoiding CC.
---
I don't think WoW Classic is played a lot by younger players. The main audience of this game are the same people who played it 15 years ago.
---
Reminds me of when he was talking about "If they added a button to get free loot in the game.... I would tell them that they should remove it, but I would 100% press it." kind of shit he said.
---
Haha yeah, Epona was my 19 druid for years. Are you making a twink this go around?
---
In one of my AV matches yesterday somebody made a portal and said ‚Äúclick for refreshment table‚Äù
---
I was a habitual school skipper for pvp in vanilla (Rank 12). So much so that I was forced to take summer courses at the community college and work part time to pay for the classes if I was going to graduate on time. The truth is, I'd do it all the same again. Some of my most precious memories are from playing wow with my internet buddies. I just barely graduated high school and decided not to go to college for a degree. Instead I applied for several trade school programs. Due to my catch up math courses I was technically ahead of my classmates when we graduated, specifically in maths. That gave me a leg up when interviewing to join and electrical apprenticeship. 
---
"where there's a will there's a way". Enjoy your life, doing what makes you happy. Just don't be lazy about it.
---
Sry I‚Äôm new what does that mean ? Like my race ? Ima undead
---
No they won't, one av is more honor than a couple hours of ganking in 6 minutes, it's not even worth it to fly out even with long queues.
---
It wasn‚Äôt less available, it was all out there once something was cleared. That‚Äôs how most guilds did it after the fact. They had the strats and videos available to watch and dissect.
---
nah not really, couldn't care less
---
guy above me read it, as i'm sure plenty of people who didn't comment
---
keep being wrong, god bless
---
Gotcha. I didn‚Äôt look at the diff, just saw the commit.
---
Of course, both bg favours alliance side greatly. 
---
Also,
---
&gt; Downvotes are the same as upvotes. They don‚Äôt matter or effect me in anyway.
---
Winning doesnt matter either, its rep and honor. And zerging av is better rep and honor than stalling for 2 hours trying to win.
---
As a raid geared tank in AV I whole heartedly disagree.  My ability to tank Van+ two warmasters actually gives my group a legitimate chance to beat the alliance in the zerg.  The groups that have to kill all four warmasters first have almost zero shot at winning.  
---
I have seen great healers hard carry AVs as well.  Individual DPS tend to be less impactful, but absolutely can carry the game.  I had a mage in one group solo distract 20+ alliance crossing the field of strife and slow them down enough to allow us to win.  Rogues can pick off important targets in the middle of the zerg and cause wipes.
---
Yes this is a huge problem being abused by premades to get the rest of their groups in.
---
Abuse of this should be accompanied by harsh penalties.
---
i think the meta is stupid because rep is more important at this early stage.
---
But..   You honestly think a horde raid expects to win when 30+ people go in to mob Belinda, and then cap every single point on the way to Van?
---
If you think we're doing that strategy and expect to win I'd have to say that makes you the dumb one...
---
But as it happens  I've won about 1/4 of the games I've been in and not one single time have we got less honor than allies,  also rep is nearly comparable.
---
What he says is true, each point of block reduces damage taken by 1 when blocking an attack.
---
sash is v good, i think banthok comes out slightly on top, but i could see it being close
---
ill try sash over banthok this monday raid and then tuesday ill try banthok and see if there is a large difference
---
You guys getting mad about people rep grinding AV as fast as possible - in a week or two the meta will shift to honor farming instead of rep grinding because everyone who wants to powerlevel exalted will be done with it already 
---
You're gonna see people killing galv and stuff around that time. Just be patient
---
I never understood why some Alliance players opposed cross-realm BGs because they wanted Horde to have unbearable long queues. They probably wished for it out of spite, but it will do nothing to improve the miserable WPvP situation if Horde players have hours-long queues. The more PvP players are sucked into BGs, the less of a nuisance they will be when other players need to do things in the open world, and this goes for both factions.
---
So what's your point? Go wank to his art if you want, it does not belong in this subreddit just as the posts "I just hit 60 by walking into Stormwind" who gives a shit about that, this sub is to talk about the game not people who are bored enough to post shit like this.
---
I'm neither for nor against 60s/twinks, but can't the same mentality be applied to lvl 60 pvp?
---
My 60 is heavily undergeared, but when I'm seen in BGs/PvP zones it's not like the 60s won't attack me because it isn't a fair fight, ya know? Why isn't the same applied to a lvl 39 that has no BiS vs a lvl 39 that has BiS?
---
No hate, I just want to see where people are coming from with the love/hate relationship the community has for twinks.
---
I use nugrunning. It gives you on screen bat countdowns on spell effects as well as their cool down timers.
---
You should unstealth and Vanish just to set their Spy addon off.
---
It's always funny to see paranoid players.
---
No wonder...
---
Horde are getting WAY more honor than Alliance. The closest I have seen was about an even 1.5k split between both, but all those 6 minute games usually end in 900 Honor for Alliance, and 3k for horde, and Alliance always win
---
and maybe they are PvE? Like PvP you get that trink you are uncatchable by anyone without it of similar mount so its like why on earth would you not have it. 
---
PvE I guess I can understand but then again moving faster is moving faster. Not sure why youd wanna unnecessarily move 3% slower
---
Just weighing in as someone who played a druid twink from vanilla to cata, the other guy is right. Druids are the best flag carriers by far. Youll have enough mana to powershoft about 10 times before you Oom.  And every FC worth their salt will start with a high int weapon and switch to high spirit weapon when they've burned through the mana. That combined with their high stamina and armour make them the best. 
---
Entangling roots and nature's grasp are excellent at stopping people following you and bash is useful too. 
---
Their healing is meh, their damage is worse, but they are by far the best at holding a flag.
---
People were making guides in Bc, Wrath... too. It's not like their guides were incomplete because they didn't work on them for years. Wow isn't so complicated that people need years to be able to make complete guides. The exact same bis, goldmaking or leveling guides would've poped on wowhead or icyveins within the first weeks even without private servers. Just like it does with every new patches.
---
Been working on that 300 fishing grind, just to get some Essences of Water. Going at your own pace &gt; anything else.
---
Lol, congrats on playing vanilla.  So did I haha.  You said that's way off?  The discussion is on Classic, not Vanilla.  Vanilla there were a lot more non twinks running around. And it may be skewed in classic because of the first day in BG and all and the 90% number will probably go down over time.
---
Rouge means red, you play a Rogue :)
---
are you HoTW spec? the 0/30/21  build?
---
An Eternium Lockbox dropped in AV and I clicked greed without thinking...needlessly to say I won't do that again.
---
It is when people can't understand it's a response to humor a post about servers being down longer for classic than retail
---
You fuckin toolbag get your min/max bullshit out of my Classic WoW. Tards like you are ruining the game and playing for fake ranks and numbers when it's infinitely more fun to actually PLAY THE GAME and fight the opposing faction. That's the entire fucking point of battlegrounds. Fucking hell... these players are ruining the game... When will it end.
---
16 hrs/day which is what a lot of streamers have been doing, at like AVG 15min/AV is like 1.4mil honor, so yeah 1 million expected for the casuals lol
---
Seriously. It's bullshit that I can't even 4 of 10 coldtooth supplies to finish the quest before alliance zergs drek and the game is over. And Fuck me if I ever try to finish the quest in the mine by the alliance base. That will never happen with av the way it is now.
---
Of course copyright law is enforceable. Preventable, not so much. People breaking the law privately can‚Äôt be stopped. But anything that gets uploaded to public hosting sure (curseforge/wowinterface/github/etc) can and will be taken down.
---
Thanks! I think this is it. It def does the job. The only thing is that I cant build a spec / tree with it i  think to properly give me the stats with gear and my spec. Unless ofc it is there, im still looking through it all !
---
Here we see the typical wow player in their natural habitat
---
Huge upgrade over what was available before... We have raid night tonight and most of us lost sleep to be on track to grind it by raid night... Get me outta here!
---
&gt; Grinding rep isn't necessarily constructive to improving PvP skill though, it's not practice in a sense that you're trying to improve your abilities.  
---
Literally no one said it is. You people have made up this idea in your head that r14 players just mindlessly zerged Van for 24 hours a day and that was just not my experience with those players at all, not to mention the fact that for a long while that was not a viable strategy.
---
All I am saying is that if you play WoW for 18 hours a day there is a very strong possibility that you're better at someone who plays most nights for an hour after work. WoW isn't the one thing in the world that you don't get better at with practice. People who play more WoW tend to be better at WoW than those who don't. And people who play WoW to the point that they're in the top .1% of pvpers tend to be "really good" at pvp. And by "really good" as we've established I mean, significantly better than most players.
---
Rank gain from honor is relative, so how much you get in a span of time is irrelevant. Nothing about having fast honor from AC incentivized any more pvp than would already have happened.
---
People did the rush strat back during Vanilla. There is plenty of youtube vids of it.
---
&gt;*whining*
---
Little self-fulfilling there, no?
---
Little crybaby, go cry somewhere else. If you don't like the post, keep scrolling. Not everyone here has a hard-on for complaining about everything like you.
---
Most alliance picked it for the pve. Zerg races are all pve. We mainly win from better dps/salve
---
They give honor to the whole raid, player kill honor is a small aoe
---
Cool man.
---
I dunno about it for alliance at least. We're getting 8 minute wins and getting ~800 honor (not counting marks)
---
Doing WSG premades, same 8 minute 3-caps.... 1400 honor (again not counting marks).
---
WSG is infinitely more fun for me, plus I get to hang out with friends.
---
I'll do AV rep when nobody is around just to get it out of the way.
---
hmmm, wasn't working for us last night. Will try again.
---
Cross realm enables a complete lack of consequences as you will never see the people again.
---
Not sure what to say other than look again.
---
Lol... Dan?
---
Try to enjoy the questing experience and stop looking at your xp bar.
---
Weird, I feel like mine got better.
---
I find that super strange considering all of the fastest wins I have seen, 6 minutes or less have all been horde. Alliance usually around 7,8 or 9 minutes
---
Azhara doesn't have a lot of quests but plenty of potential for grinding, Felwood has quests but it might have more players, you can try there. Western Plaguelands is a must.
---
My first av yesterday, before realizing the meta, I immediately went south at the start to grab wolves cause I remembered doing that in vanilla. I tamed exactly 4 wolves for 1 rep each turn in before alliance killed drek.
---
&gt;and only if your are one of the classes whose trinket dispells fear.
---
Ohhh, so some classes pvp trinket removes fear?
---
Sunken Temple, first half of BRD
---
I couldn't find it either. I eventually went to the bank, transferred my keys to the bank, and on transferring them back to my bags they went to the keyring.
---
This is just not accurate at all.
---
Warsong is still FAR better honor than wpvp, they could literally remove AV and there won't be the mass griefing that was earlier.
---
Balance != representation. Druids always have, currently do, and always will have an overloaded kit compared to a lot of other classes. I won‚Äôt deny that.
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean they have a crazy representation. As with WSG,?druid are the best pick. But they aren‚Äôt the only pick and aren‚Äôt *always* the default pick. So yes, the pool is diverse.
---
1. Doesn't change anything.  Whatever the fastest honor grind is, people will do it.
---
2. Killing wpvp is a good thing.  Unless you were the majority faction, you didn't have to watch groups disband due to difficulty in reaching the dungeon.
---
As much as I enjoy Wonkyness of PVP in MMO's I completely agree. I generally tell friends that I want PVP to be an afterthought in any MMO/RPG I play, and if I want some some balanced PVP I'll play a shooter or Moba to fill that drive.
---
Lol ok
---
I can see that, but couldn't same "hours of grinding hundreds of gold" be applied to things like an epic mount? If you try to PvP at 60 without an epic mount you just get slaughtered if you can't stealth.
---
Also, I feel like gear optimization is the only thing TO do at 60 (aside from actual pvp itself), whereas non-twinks are really just 'passing-through' if that makes sense? They'll be out of the bracket quickly (assuming it's the 19,29, and 39 brackets) whereas 60s don't have any other options at 60 for the undergeared 60s to turn to.
---
\*Entire opener misses

GG
---
Because it shows that there is a better way to run AV. If the alliance get more honor at the end by doing the opposite strat that we are doing then we should do that strat to get more honor.
---
Necessary for what?  Forgiving people who wanted to be on a dominate % faction and Blizz's lack of faction dependent queues?
---
Screenshots please.  Name and shame the assholes
---
BRD if you can find a coordinated group should be fine, otherwise I would hit ST until 53-54 then BRD, at 56-57 you can start with LBRS/Strat
---
But then you get repair bill that's too expensive.
---
nice try schlomo
---
Oh come one. It's pretty funny.
---
''y o u r an e v i l n a i n l an d e r''
---
well important in world PvP too really. I mean shit its just passive moving 3% at 0 cost thats always a good thing lol
---
OK Boomer
---
gloves for pve, t1 for pvp.
---
Totem recall?   You mean just replacing them or relocating them?   There is no totemic recall in classic.
---
We here at \[every TBC private server that has existed for the last 10 years\] laugh whole-heartedly at you
---
Things are chill asf
---
The only point you've made that has any sense to it is the raids; they should really have been 10man and 20man, not 10man and 25man. But we roll with the punches
---
They get shit talked in world or lfg when they speak.
---
So that's something?
---
As someone who was part of the HWL premade on my server back in the day...
---
I have popcorn ;)
---
I was getting 3300 exp per turn in (did it multiple times) for armorscraps that are looted from dead enemy players. Idk if this was a bug or what, but I was just looting corpses for EZ exp
---
&gt; Also, I feel like gear optimization is the only thing TO do at 60 (aside from actual pvp itself), whereas non-twinks are really just 'passing-through' if that makes sense? They'll be out of the bracket quickly (assuming it's the 19,29, and 39 brackets) whereas 60s don't have any other options at 60 for the undergeared 60s to turn to.
---
Well yeah, that's kinda what I was getting at in the sense that most 19's are just "passing through" on their way to 20 while twinks are treating 19 like endgame.
---
1. It's not fun to be the only guy leaving the zerg, killing random idiots who just want to run to the last boss isn't "pvp". 
---
2. You are punished for pvping/having fun
---
3. It is the game developers responsibility to make the most optimal path also be a fun path. If that isn't the case, then you failed as a game developer.
---
That is kind of how life works though? 
---
The most skilled people don't get promotions, people who are willing to sacrifice their other responsibilities for their job do.  The people who rise to the very top are both.  Skilled and #NoWorkLifeBalance. 
---
Most things in life are a measurement not of what you provide, but what you are willing to give up.  Are you willing to give up your Family's stability to take yet another promotion that requires you to move to across the country?  No?  We'll find someone who is, and they will get that promotion.
---
WSG will also need to be significantly more efficient otherwise the min-maxers will resort to graveyard camping within the BG or deathballing in the open world - I am fine with this or any other solution that stabilizes the wPvP situation.
---
I mean does Horde really come out on top? The fact that they go for max honor earned just means that it will raise the amount of honor needed to get standing.
---
I'd much rather get the rep grind out of the way.
---
the worst part is that the towers no longer buff the final boss + his guards. they used to give a very large buff (this was NEVER changed btw from what i remember) to the boss to prevent exactly this
---
Rogues. They play rogues.
---
The game is so light armor heavy at 19 (3 cloth classes, 4 leather, 2 mail), one backstab crit means game over for most players
---
I see you too are on the struggle bus against warlocks and shadow priests...
---
Yup I do. And I don‚Äôt feel bad at all because I remember the wpvp gankfest
---
Only leggings and bracers atm.
---
Nothing.  Wrong.
---
I played on a BC private server many years ago that had exactly this but was an obstacle course constructed out of crates, barrels, and boxes starting from the ground and transitioning to boxes floating in midair. If you were able to complete the whole box jumping course, which was actually insanely difficult and had to restart from the beginning each time you failed, the reward was a legendary cloak! 
---
Of course not to be implemented in classic, but it was a lot of fun.
---
Did it work?
---
How are you punished for pvp?
---
Better than the Mages porting people to Darnassus saying "Click portal to summon our healer"
---
It has nothing to do with AV and everything to do with Blizzard's choice to give us the idiot version of AV.
---
Confuses add-ons that help you Target players
---
*waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. People fucking widely LOATHED the old AV. It was garbage, and even then people tried to take measures to expedite it. 
---
It has always been a problematic BG for large swaths of players, it is very far from objectively fun .
---
Ah yes, killing the same honorless targets 8-20 times is such a good honor farm. I forgot. /s
---
Which East Coast PVE server is best/most populated for Horde
---
I started with westfall - which is a good one - but I've been playing more alliance on it and would rather have a dedicated alliance realm, and a dedicated horde realm
---
yeah just takes longer to do it bc the strat doesnt change. Big thing is when she gets close i jump and flick my mouse into her to i face her while travelling through the air. Not sure if it helps but it seems like i can reliably proc her dust cloud. Ill try to record/stream a run tonight and i can dm it to you if you would like.
---
Nah we had the opposite issue in vanilla--actual afkers at the start leeching free honor
---
More often than not it was multiple no lifers, and some afk botting sprinkled in.
---
It was left over from retail wow.  Someone developed a macro that recalled totems the same way it worked in TBC
---
I do not really think that is a new mentality. During BC everyone would PvP becasue it was the easiest way to get gear as a new player. If Vanilla released 1.12 AV at the start with almost free epics people would have been zerging it all the same.
---
You can get AFK mass reported for not following the meta, just look at the other posts about that. Defending is fun but that is not pvp, it's basically 1 or 2 vs 30 which is the same thing that people were complaining about in p2 wpvp
---
We aren't executing the losing strategy?   We're executing Belinda and as many guards and captains as we can for rep and honor.
---
And we always end up with more honor, and rep is close.
---
Reported and less honor
---
Do that backdoor strat to just lose anyway. I‚Äôd rather farm honor during my 5-7 min lose
---
Horde will continue to rush and loose 85% of the time untill morale improves !
---
Pay for school???
---
&gt; eft over from retail wow. Someone developed a macro that recalled totems the same way it worked in TBC
---
TIL...    So its fixed now?   Good.   #nochanges
---
I tried to convince my wife of this strat. Wasn‚Äôt having it.
---
https://i.imgur.com/vPikZ6k.png
---
Is there even a reason why it's sorted that way? I guess it goes by creation time but I agree with you, it would make it easier to find the one you want to join.
---
&gt; Since the horde team will be ~90% max level for the tier, I hope the ones who fell for this are the low level alliance who insist on "helping" in BG's.
---
Low level healers still can help. Maybe not as great as raid geared healers.. but AV mobs are just raid trash
---
That's messed up, I hope they get in trouble for this.  
---
I foresee this happening a lot to fresh 60's and also 60's not in raid gear in the future when they end up in groups with people decked out in raid gear.
---
As someone who played heavily in BC, Wraith...yes.
---
Blacklisting should be a thing, absolutely.  Crossrealm killed the server.
---
&gt; do some damn pvp, split off from the zerg and defend 
---
...get 5 reports, get a boot from BG and 15 min deserter debuff. Not even kidding, that's very likely going to happen.
---
That's 1 in 1,000,000
---
Awh fuck
---
You know you actually benefit from ranking without getting r14 right?
---
One major fix was making the last boss scale heavily depending on if his warmasters are still up. This forced you to destroy at least a few of the bunkers/towers before attempting him
---
I have only seen two alliance groups get more than 1000 rep in zerg games, out of ~30 games.  
---
Most certainly are not going for the full clear.  Which is crazy, a 5 man group can take all the free shit lying around while the rest zerg.
---
Thanks! 43 days, 17 hours.
---
or darken the stuff you're pasting, even. either way works.
---
Is the AV mount ‚Äúepic‚Äù, or is that the rank 11?
---
except ranking is faction based, so getting more honor in comparison to alliance per BG means jack shit when it comes to your fellow hordies.
---
For this to occur you will have to wait a few months until the rep grinders are done, the rank 14 burnouts are out of the race and the 0.5% of players reach their goals, after that pvp might be fun.
---
Pretty cheap for a BiS epic!
---
Hey, I'll help against the alliance as soon as I stop getting killed by archers and rams.
---
AV is 10k+ honor/hour. 20h/day is 1.4M honor
---
Blizzards new company slogans:
---
"Our least is the best we can do"
---
"We're not happy until you're not happy"
---
What a stupid reason to report someone for.
---
Ah good old spot...
---
/played is just about to hit 8 days so that could be worse I guess !
---
this behavior pissed me off at first but tbh if someone is dumb enough to click that, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even want them on my team either
---
70% for him
---
There is also bonus honor for the first to kill the Captain which adds randomness.
---
Horde can also play properly and avoid turtles if they don‚Äôt cap the first graveyard. (gonna be hard to stop the plebs from doing that)
---
Alliance can stop a turtle if they cap the Strife graveyard. I would do this if I felt the group didn‚Äôt sound prepared or capable of the Zerg.
---
So have you been having success actually provoking some battles etc? I've been skeptical that it does much most times, outside a skirmish here or there, or that I'd have time to do anything like cap a bunker or something before someone kills Drek or Van. I'll probably give it more of a go next time I'm in AV though. 
---
If I had a group, maybe a mage and a healer and a hunter or something, I bet defending choke points would be a blast with nova and frost trap, etc. Because folks couldn't just skip you as easily.
---
All we care is the rewards we get from reputation, if u want HKs u can que WSG
---
since I view honor as essentially useless, I tend to agree that more rep is better. &gt;!plus human racial gets 10% more rep!&lt;
---
I did around 25 games last night, in around 15 or so o split and tried to defend either in a small group or solo. No one reported me or even complained.
---
Yeah but only if they kept all of Morrowinds archaic RPG abstractions like like hitting an enemy with your weapon but missing because of your attack roll.
---
Well if people fall for it, you didnt lose someone important :)
---
so yeah instead of flaming, say thank you!
---
I prefer turtle mode
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like orcs
---
Yep!
---
Place them back down in a safe place like you're supposed to.
---
Do some pvp. Slow the game down. Get less rep/honor. Check honorspy. Find out you are plummeting down in standing because you were foolish enough to pvp in a pvp match.
---
Yeah and the community knows what‚Äôs best, let‚Äôs let them decide!
---
?
---
The intent was okay, the execution was poor. It should have queried the player with a "you have been marked as AFK, please confirm that you are not or you will be kicked in 15 seconds," or something like that.  So if you really were afk, you'd get reported and booted, but if you're just minding your own business, you're fine.
---
I felt the same way, I wasn't playing much compared to other players. I eventually quit after about 2 weeks, I'm glad I did.
---
I got a job for $23 an hour, quit that job, now $31 an hour. Also joined the union as a mechanic. I'll be making $42+ an hour in 4 years of hard work.
---
Owning land and a nice house sounds better than playing a computer game.
---
I agree with what everyone else has said. Also if you‚Äôre planning to stay fury, do the elite quests in Winterspring to get Rune of the Guard captain (BiS trinket) - level 51 elites that you need a group for. 
---
Then when you‚Äôre like 56-57+, go to eastern plague lands and do the Tirian Fordring quest line for your Mark of Fordring (BiS necklace). There‚Äôs a lot of mob grinding and running around in EPL for the first few quests - then you‚Äôll have to do a Stratholme Live etc. It‚Äôs long but do it while you get xp from it. 
---
Source: fury warrior who grinded (ground?) dungeons to 60 and then had to go back and do these quests to get the items.
---
Alliance rushes Drek for fast wins for faster rep while Horde rushes Balinda for more Honor/min. This means that Alliance will hit Exalted faster, but Horde will get more Honor for ranks as they care far more about competing for PvP rewards over AV specific rewards. We will see which is more effective. Horde will have higher thresholds for the higher ranks for sure.
---
The OV AV is shite and instead of these idiots having mental breakdowns because a bg doesn't take 2 hours you'd have different set of idiots complaining that they can't bang their rep out in a couple days.
---
No. It's not at all the same. You can Google it but alliance have like 30 seconds on horde best case scenario, and horde have to walk through three bottlenecks being shot at while alliance have one.
---
Yup 25 people willingly left because they saw greener pastures. If your guild is solid you wouldn‚Äôt see so many looking to get out.
---
Like others have mentioned, block value is a flat damage reduction (50 block means -50 damage taken per hit). Because of this, the damage reduction of block is highly effective versus many small hits but ineffective versus few large hits. 
---
The benefit of wearing a shield is more a result of the significant armor contribution which provides physical damage reduction (%). 
---
And for warriors, wearing a shield lets you use [Shield Block](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2565/shield-block). Because of how the [attack table](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table) works, the Shield Block ability prevents raid bosses from hitting you with Crushing Blows (+50% bonus damage). This is primarily what makes Warriors the preferred tank class in classic. The first talent point in Improved Shield Block is quite powerful because it allows the tank to be uncrushable for 2 hits every 5 seconds.
---
I do have benediction but i think i have old weapons in my bank i can throw on to show you dont need it. Im pretty sure you can do it naked. Just make sure you have a high dps wand you can usually get a of the tiger etc for really cheap since they have poor stats but all you are after on it are the base dmgs.
---
Isn't WSG rep one of the longest grinds in the game? My 10 year old main on retail doesn't even have exalted with WSG.
---
Got back into archeage to play with some friends who have been playing unchained.
---
I play a prot warrior and I am 58, some of the exalted AV gear looks amazing for me. I never played BGs in retail, I have read the guides on wowhead but overall is there a role for defensive spec'd warriors in AV or do I need to respec arms and try to be a damage dealer? I also have a level 28 warlock that I think may be fun to try in WSG. Basically, where do I learn how to "git gud"
---
random question: what is this meme from? is it a web comic?
---
Twink NElf hunter shadowmelding mid to pick off easy kills as they try to run by.  Flag? Who cares? Pew pew pew.
---
Take a few hp pots for rag so healers are less stressed. I started raiding 2 weeks ago for the first time ever and it's pretty easy more about knowing the fights and doing what the leader says for that fight
---
He said it, not me. Thats the joke. Guess it went over your head.
---
Is there a good way for a holy pally and mage to farm gold together (that would be better than a mage farming solo)? If we had a tank would there be a good 3-man we could do?
---
You're right but these people never brought up that there was an issue in the first place. It was people we trusted that convinced them to otherwise leave.
---
How can we fix a problem if there isn't one until someone "creates one"
---
Herbs are super cheap on my server. Even dreamfoil/plaguebloom only go for like ~6g per stack.
---
I switched over to Mining and make 100% of my gold from arcane crystals, just stealth farming Silithus or stealthing around the elite area in Winterspring. I do it early morning when nobody else is on.
---
Cap snowfall
---
Yep this was the strat in 80+% of the AVs I did yesterday.  20-30 people go to mid and kill Bal, cap the two bunkers, and kill all the Lts and Commanders.  All that is like 2k+ honor right away.  Then the zerg moves north and clears out Dun Baldar. 
---
If the ally is on their game, you just about have enough time to clear the mid of Bal + all the Lts.  if the ally is crap and get held up, then you can easily win.  One game we had 4500 honor and a 12 minute win or something like that it was nuts

---
Come be excellent with us!
---
And of course the plate and the shoulders.
---
MA6A
---
If it‚Äôs 25 people, you should assume you are the problem and not them.
---
Appreciate the response my friend.  How is the Paladin play style in comparison?  Are you playing ret?
---
Fuck that asshat
---
Nothing will happen to you.
---
yah if you prefer WSG (Id suggest a premade) then go for it
---
you will still more than likely keep progressing, even if slower, in rank up until about 10 if i recall
---
so long as your standing that week is enough to keep you above the decay - but thats dependent on your factions pvp and population of pvpers
---
after 11 is when you absolutely need to start hitting the big standings, and 13-14 will probably require standing 1-3 for a few weeks, .... with you absolutely needing 1 for 2-3 weeks to get it done in any form of a reasonable time
---
Bah, that shit just bothers me. They can pry the win from my cold dead hands.
---
(I also know that I'm in that boat by myself.)
---
getting till r10 / r11 isnt that hard even when u dont no life it. and after then it starts real grind. and i think most people dont even aim for r14. for example if i will push it it will be for r13m so i can get set. dont really wanna (or can ) grind last run for wep.
---
I'm HOTW (0/30/21) so I stealth farm the bug caves in Silithus, make decent gold selling Arcane Crystals. Since you're Moonglow, you could try the elite area in Winterspring, since you don't need to fight anything to get those nodes, however there's less of them since it's a smaller area.
---
In the right as you enter after Flamelash. 
---
Talk to start the dark iron bar mining quest
---
Only because not many people know about it yet. Give it time, it will get much much worse.
---
I'm that guy. I don't care I just want my shit to sell quickly and if that means I make 20% less than I could potentially I'm good with it.
---
I assumed he referred to the epic items, but you're right.
---
You need 2 accounts for this?
---
Having seen it function in person in PvE content on these huge servers, yes.
---
How does this post not break rule 1
---
Can confirm it‚Äôs there
---
Auctioneer allows you to input stack size when listing.
---
Agreed, the honor system is what's forcing this whole issue.
---
Since alliance can zerg faster, in order for them to stay competitive in ranking for their faction they need to gets wins as fast as possible.
---
Since horde can't zerg as fast for them to stay competitive they need to farm as much honor as they can before the game ends.
---
Never trust gaming reddits.
---
What‚Äôs Zerging?
---
Wtf, how is that name allowed?
---
Everything is fucking wholesome these days. Ridiculous
---
Not sure try this make AD set naked minus the trink, make sure allow empty slots is checked and give it a whirl
---
What guild was doing this?
---
This only says who all was in the raid, not who was actually abusing the system. Only takes 3 or 4 people to trigger the afk flag.
---
Using ‚Äúyour‚Äù when you mean ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù and telling me to use common sense?  Follow YOUR own ADVICE LOL
---
For the Gallywitz shekels!
---
Nah, what I did was just take all my keys out of my bag and put them in the bank, and when I right clicked them to take them out of the bank, they automatically went into the keyring.
---
When 3/4 players ask for a specific change, I think it should be at the very least considered.
---
If Blizzard knows best then why has the WoW playerbase dwindled in the past years? If they knew best there would be no need to re-release old content before THEIR changes impacted the game.
---
Your logic is deeply flawed. 
---
Hard pass, nerd boi.
---
I didnt know there even was a portal, tried to move my screen and ended up in if
---
If they never brought it up it's because your guild didn't foster an environment in which they thought they would be listened to or that the issues would be addressed. Outside of scheduling, leaving to play with friends, and things like that, if your guild is losing members it's 100% on the guild leadership. No excuses.
---
Imagine how easy it would be to get ahead if you were getting 3k+ as ally though. That's what the premades are doing
---
Time is money, friend
---
Here comes the mental health circle jerk
---
Yeah, if I'm not in premade, I just do /rw 60% mounts go for galv etc, and rest go drek
---
Who said punish?
---
Awesome dude, I really appreciate the help!
---
Best bet is to pick up that tank and do DM East jump runs. Make sure some is a miner/herber.
---
Net each person about 20-25g/hour.
---
And 1.12 av is fucking garbage
---
Am I missing something, why are you saying Bannu haha
---
Welcome home.
---
I attempt to pvp in a pvp match. I succeed in pvping, but match takes 30 minutes to gain 4k honor.
---
Guy next to me at the queue did no pvp in his matches. He did 5 matches while I was doing 1. He got 15k honor.
---
Now explain how that's not a punishment in a system completely based on relative honor totals?
---
God damn dude. I play nearly all the time and don't even have half that.
---
I just google ‚Äúgear calculator wow classic‚Äù and use the first one that comes up.
---
I remember playing games for fun.  Seemed like ages ago.
---
Non-cross realm BGs will just push dominant faction players on heavily imbalanced servers back to the open world. Great way to kill servers for good.
---
Whatever spec you end up deciding on, begin with the following:
---
\- spec 5/5 wand spec, then 5/5 siphon life. Decide after that whether you'd like to go further into shadow, disc, or holy (I'd recommend shadow, you can heal almost everything up til 60)
---
For professions I would grab mining/herbalism, or \[mining or herb\]/engi if you think you'll be PVPing.
---
Lastly, if you are completely new to whatever server you're rolling on, go to a populated area and literally beg someone to give you a wand (level 5 enchanting wand) and if you're lucky the level 13 wand as well. This will vastly speed up your level 5-20 grind.
---
The BG just started, I had just finished killing a horde and I was at the front of the pack heading to drek. You can see literally no one was ahead of me. Nice username btw
---
Last night, for the first time, I stepped *inside* the bankers' cage in UC. 
---
I was SHOCKED that I could simply hop through the stupid grille that had click-blocked my mouse cursor all these years.
---
Well that‚Äôs kind of the point. They‚Äôre not prebis right now. By the time the agi enchants are out you would have replaced them.
---
Pretty much on top of the dps yes, got prebis maybe except for the belt and some epics already. Cons are usually protection pots, restorative, mongoose, some food buff.
---
eh. I was pretty solid at pvp on my 60 in vanilla. 
---
but twinking was fun when i was burned out on all the grinds associated with pvp and raiding.
---
They waited weeks for you to try and establish a raid schedule. If you wanted to keep them you should have proactively worked with another guild for a joint run, or led your own pug. 25-30 guildies is plenty of people for a core group to fill with pugs.
---
Going straight to the boss and killing him as quickly as possible.
---
There's dozens of threads on the front page yesterday saying the same thing, but yep, you're the only one bud.
---
Odds are you will die in raid to no fault of your own, so good luck unless you are paying an elite guild to carry you.
---
Downvoted for emoji - such scum.
---
Can someone provide some information on changing my UI and getting some clean add-ons? I tried watching YouTube videos for it, but it was still an ordeal. Thanks!
---
There are so many toxic elements in the community these days, it's almost stunning.
---
100% this
---
No, people are already exalted so its too late.
---
Haha, what a moron. :D your societies are so ill these days you can't even make a joke before smb is crying in reddit or twitter and bunch of white knights showing up for great justice :D Thank god in my society they still don't point fingers and sentencing for jokes. :)
---
Why would you be summoning people into a by in the first place. That's the first issue you need to think about, it was a flawed task from the start. Pay just a little bit of attention instead of focusing on other stuff and just half ass semi afking the bg
---
Same, I assumed Alliance didn't get as much because I have yet to see that.
---
No.
---
There is also no chance of Classic+.
---
They will continue to roll out things as is with as minimal work as possible for maximum profit.
---
Only works off peak times
---
I reached revered with a 4% win rating and all my team has done was farm Balinda and all LTS around the area.
---
They were not really prepared, not everyone had their potions to be honest, I guess it's hard when you re doing a joint job with another guild. I've made a decision already and I left them on amiable terms; now I m pending acceptance on a guild with 4 weekly mc runs xD.
---
wait for tbc when totemic recall becomes an actual mechanic
---
Do wsg?
---
This is the AV that is from 1.12, aka part of vanilla. We knew this was coming for months.
---
Its an undisputed fact that at 19, druids are the best carriers. I don't know what you're trying to argue for. This isn't some guys opinion, its the result of the game being designed the way it is. If you want a different class to be the best carrier at 19, fundamental interactions and balance changes throughout the game would need to be implemented.
---
personally i want AV rep for the items. after that ill do some minimal amount of AV to maintain my rank 3 status for the 10% discount. i dont care about PVP rank, i did all of that in vanilla (r14) not doing it again
---
Blinking gives you a 1 sec buff that makes you immune to stuns. If you watch any old vanilla mage video you can see this was how it worked back then aswell.
---
Yea, sorry but if I were in a guild that for weeks was promising we would raid - and nothing ever came of it... id leave too. The guild im in started its first raid with a 25 man core and pugged everyone else (I was one of those pugs, and was in a guild like yours that was promising raids but not trying to get there).
---
I pretty much only raidlog (classic is not really my taste), so I don't have my finger on the pulse of what servers are good. The only one that I've heard particularly good things about was Grobbulus (RPPVP) but I can understand why a person might not want to commit to that kind of server. People still meme around and don't really take the RP part seriously, but yeah.. Just do some research, you'll find a server.
---
Crazy concept but if it‚Äôs fast for ally it‚Äôs gonna be just as fast for horde just because your server might be poo poo and feel like it‚Äôs horde dominated. They‚Äôre are more alliance toons than horde
---
You think you want #nochanges, but you dont
---
Yes it was a real battle it was fun. There is nothing fun about AV in the 1.12 version zero it's a fucking terrible bg there is nothing satisfying about it. It fucking sucks.
---
I just posted about this as well with a video of it. Pretty crazy it takes so few people to get people kicked like this. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9bwdq/report_abuse_in_av_only_takes_5_people_to_target/
---
I remember when it was first released, there weren't a lot of NPC's and AV would take 20-40 hours to finish.
---
I would love to have that back... I did two AV's yesterday and won both, the worst part is I killed more NPC's than players...
---
All turtles are alliance turtles losing slowly making everyone waste their time. I don't know what the other alliance think they'll accomplish. They'll win eventually by having everyone in the AV sit next to alliance home base? It's a waste of time farming honor in 40 man raid where you get very low honor per kill, especially because the alliance just gets farmed by horde at chokepoints.
---
It might be fun for classes that do damage, but as a healer in a pug I just sit dead because nobody peels, nobody assists, everyone is overextended, and alliance just gets backed into a corner and slowly loses as they lose all graveyards.
---
Patch 2.0 completely removes the honor system and makes it a currency to be used alongside arena rankings.
---
I hear you, but it was a super nice thing that, while but true to the vanilla spirit, I came to enjoy having. On the flip side, they broke nearly all totem timer add-ons with the changes they made to break the script
---
Care to add specifics on how those people have seen their progess/gameplay hindered by the entire server at large?
---
Loksey, release the hounds!
---
i‚Äôm having this problem a lot.
---
It all depends on where you find the fun. I find fun twice a week on raid nights. I get through the other bullshit (gearing) as quick as possible to get to that.
---
They made all Pvp honor gear updated despite some of it being announced for phase 6.Which is a smart and balanced move.But then they don't add AV ring ?? Wtf
---
Man, I really hope there's actually action being taken. We don't get to see the work they do to help the game, only the posts responding to legitimate concerns saying, "we don't do anything about that".
---
And I couldnt be happier. I'm leveling alts for thr inevitable tbc release :)
---
same with PvP blues ,mages spellblade for honor..
---
They weren't really welfare epics before 1.12 you had to fight long battles and kill a lot of enemies to get them. You earned you exalted rep before it became a zergfest.
---
As a OSRS player that never played wow until classic was announced this triggers me. People use OSRS as the example of what Blizzard should have done but it is EXACTLY what they are doing, just without polls. OSRS came out just like the game was in 2007, aka a terrible game that was tedious and annoying filled with all the bugs and scams that were later patched out in the 2000‚Äôs (Imagine if they released wow without an auction house for a year). The bad things play into the experience of the game and later on when things get stale they can change it. The #nochanges crowd want to experience the game as it was and once Nax is released and the game is set to die Bliz will be more free to make the game actually better.                                                            TLDR: OSRS was released as tedious and annoying as Classic and wasn‚Äôt changed until much later on in its life.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll keep these in mind when loggin in
---
For sure man thanks
---
All good buddy! Restrict my statement
---
Not sure what ur takin about but I‚Äôll look it up, thanks
---
&gt;some accident on a zeppelin
---
Wow.
---
At the extreme top end, minor differences are made more apparent. The top will always use what gives even the slightest boost. Gladiator level a range that gives a fair look at representation due to this. 
---
The same issues comes up in retail with top tier Mythuc+. The ultra high levels have little-to-no variation and class diversity is nonexistent.
---
You‚Äôre using what basically becomes an outlier range that a minuscule percentage of the playerbase experiences as your baseline.
---
Ah. I guess that's what i get for only looking at part of the issue.
---
Lmao who‚Äôs getting reported for playing defense? stop making things up
---
It's not.
---
The amount of times I had to explain that locks can use dark runes too is amazing.
---
The post above mine is good. I just feel too much rage is never a bad thing. If you end up near max rage, just cleave and sunder from defensive stance.
---
On a side note, every ability you use should be a macro with /startattack
---
Had a Krol Blade drop in my second. Our push grinded to a halt as people waited to see who would get it. Then we lost.
---
He did it on his YT stream, cant tell if he did it during any other stream because that was the only one I ever watched. But conveniently you can't watch that anymore.
---
Sweet thanks for the info!
---
cry more hordecucks lmao
---
It's very disputed. The main thing that makes Druids good at this role at max level (mobility) does not exist at level 19.
---
We had an idiot who managed to get himself blacklisted. He couldn't get into a guild anymore so he had to make his own guild. The only people in his guild were trolls just like him. He eventually quit, thank god.
---
Low effort but relatable. Relatively fresh meme content. You son of a bitch, have an upvote.
---
Even now, Paladins are a better raid support than Shamans for everyone, except melee. The more gear your raid has, the better Paladins get.
---
It's literally right there...
---
I believe the counterweight for attack speed affects Feral attack speed, or so I've read. Not sure about +damage. Could be they don't know any better.
---
It will change in a few weeks.  Everyone is min maxing rep right now but after people are done with that grind they start turtling for fun
---
Also, which servers would you recommend? I've always played Horde and plan on doing so
---
This is what happens when your userbase has all grown up and become dads.
---
Sure, that‚Äôs the difference between the casual and the hardcore, or people interested in speedrunning. Some people constantly want to be improving and reaching to be better - some are content to sit where they are.
---
The Reddit community is overwhelmingly casual and falls into the latter.
---
/waves in bear form with thorns :D
---
I admire that tenacity. But if I were in that situation, I‚Äôd honestly be trying to scuttle your boat. Or at least make no effort to stop it.
---
Are you the gaming police or something?
---
Is there any action I need to perform to get the update?
---
Nope, we get the shit version of AV where 2 factions race to kill an NPC. The Alliance normally wins granting better rep, the Horde farm more bonus honor and entire matches can be finished in mere minutes with zero PvP. Just gotta grind to exalted and never come back.
---
Look man, you may be right about that and Im not saying the system is without flaw. But for christ sake who cares, sometimes i just wanna kill a few dudes and if the match takes a few minutes longer for it so be it.
---
If you were getting exp per turn in for armor scraps, that was definitely a bug as only the first time should give experience.
---
At least its pvp and not pve only
---
You can make a bot that queues you up, accepts queue, presses R in the cave being afk and you would get much more honor actually trying to do pvp. It is not fun whatsoever, and there is no fun to be had in this version of AV, Blizzard had been getting feedback for a year about this. Same with sharding and people getting a ton of black lotus really quickly.
---
&gt;This system will crush people
---
Just like Vanilla! ;)
---
Seriously though, the number of people I know first hand who up and quite the game entirely within days/weeks of hitting HWL is kind of silly.  Within a month of hitting it I was a reroll on a new server for world PvP in a guild that gave out awards for most **dis**honorable kills in a week.  I went from farming the shit out of the honor system to completely abusing it...lol
---
Could someone explain what happened here?
---
I watched the clip twice and I still don't get it.
---
TBC will kill classic in a month, lol.
---
When did I say blizzard knows what‚Äôs best? Oh... that‚Äôs right.. I didn‚Äôt. 
---
You‚Äôre assuming that is my logic when it is you‚Äôre own - since you came up with it. Don‚Äôt put words in my mouth, guy. 
---
Try again.  
---
The only changes that should occur are within the vanilla timeline, anything that did not occur within that timeframe simply isn‚Äôt vanilla anymore. 
---
And FYI not sure what rock you‚Äôve been living under but *most* of the changes that occurred in wow were things that the playerbase suggested.
---
Games full of virgins like the ones you just talked about. We gotta deal with it lol
---
I had a mage from the same faction as me intentionally mess up my aoe pulls on dalson's tears.  when i tried to talk to him, not one word in reply.  He was a chinese gold farmer I think but still, totally toxic.
---
Yes, but more importantly, a blocked attack cannot be a crushing blow. This is one of the reasons warriors are superior to druids as tanks.
---
Which also does not have any guards...
---
Not sure why you have the impression Alliance is playing better then.
---
Very funny
---
Both mean less in the wash....by the end of the next week, most people that want to be exalted will be exalted, regardless of faction or W/L, just about time in the game.
---
A 60 druid tank, especially if well-geared, can soak up a TON of damage.  I think the lack of damage from having a 3rd DPS is offset somewhat by that.  However you also have a paladin doing DPS so that's not ideal. 
---
Your group may be more ideally suited to have paladin heals and shadowpriest damage.  You can also use mind control on some fights (or enslave demon in lots of Dire Maul) to deal a lot of effective damage.   
---
Whatever you do, the content is definitely doable as a 4man nomatter what.  The warlock will have to be flexible either to AOE, single target, CC depending on situation.  You may have to learn mechanics more than a 5-man group.  But you'll be fine.  
---
As a horde druid tank I'm also drooling over the possibilty of ret aura + thorns.
---
I think you get XP for the turn-in quest
---
...download the new version of the addon when they release?
---
/waves in hunter with scare beast (niche as hell lol)
---
You can also just click and drag your keys to the key ring icon next to your bags. It doesn't have to open for the keys to move.
---
The appeal is having a Naxx weapon a year early and dominating the game until likely they entire Classic lifecycle. What‚Äôs so hard to understand.
---
Check this guy out!
---
I mained a rogue in vanilla and multi-hour AVs were one of my favourite things.
---
A patch just went out yesterday, so the addons still need to be fixed from the creators, and most should be (assuming the creators are still active).  
---
Otherwise your scan data may have been wiped, and you may just need to re-scan the AH for prices.
---
Damn, you're right. That never occurred to me. Some 4D thinking right there.
---
You there! Check out that noise!
---
I‚Äôd be down with that.

---
Elixir of Mongoose and elixir of giants for agility and AP
---

---

---
They're garbage for casters, why would you even mention them LOL
---
No skill is winning vs most of the other premades to the point where they instant afk vs you. With only glad and r1 players (+classic exp) it could be done
---
Ok, thought you implied it would get a fix automatically.
---
Guy on my server changed his name to "my gm's name"Bank, got himself invited into our guild by an unsuspecting officer, then asked for donations (righteous orbs, dreamfoil, etc.) - made off with 300+ g worth of mats before being found out.  GMs took ALL The gold from his account but he's still on the server and no one seems to care :(
---
I pick C
---
If the alliance on your server are all getting 1700 honor per AV, or 3700 honor per AV it doesn't matter in the slightest because the pvp ranking system is a based on a curve.
---
Now if you can somehow convince all of the alliance on your server to get 1700 while you and your 39 friends get 3700, you would be onto something, but since that isn't going to happen, sit back, enjoy the fast rep, and pray Blizzard will turn AV into a slugfest once you hit exalted.
---
No. TBC AV was quite bad. What made it worse is that it gave out the most honor out of all the BGs even when you lost. So people just did that BG, rushed it all the time and it was just not fun at all. People went into the other BGs to actually pvp and have fun. But honor didn't matter that much in TBC after a while you got every item you needed from it and just did the other BGs to actually pvp and have fun. 
---
But in classic with rewards tied to it you're wasting time if you are going for the rewards and not doing AV.
---
People now play for efficiency, fast av = efficiency.
---
You do way too much mental masturbation.
---
I‚Äôve read the same. Counterweight works to boost attack speed. +dmg does nothing.
---
Good thing you can do WSGs instead, if you prefer.
---
Okay, I see your point now. Makes sense.
---
I‚Äôm talking from a PvP point, not PvE lmao ..
---
There are no battlegroups. Every single NA realm is combined into one queuing pool.

It's really stupid, I know.

If I've understood auctioneer correctly, it shows you a 99% chance of getting a shard, and a 1% chance of getting a Nexus crystal. The two gold values below represent two things, I believe, one being the highest amount of gold you could get, being the value of the Nexus crystal, and the other one being the average gold you will get.
---

Haha probably, didn‚Äôt want a to burst your bubble :) regardless, seems like a fun thing to do and I wish you the best.

---
Checkmate
---
So, you and I probably agree in how we both should generally approach gameplay.  I rolled a prot paladin and form all my own groups without allowing any reserves or asking for tips as a tank.  
---
However, the spy addon was a way for players to cheat that directly affected me.  I actually could not avoid spy, even though I never installed it.
---
The same is true ( to an extent ) for AV. I can't group queue. I am thrown in with 39 assorted people who right now mostly have the same goal: succeed zerging or desert without trying. Now for alliance this is a viable means to farm reputation, but horde players are slowly realizing they shouldn't win a base race against roughly even teams. I think eventually av matches will slow down and a real meta will develop once horde players begin to adapt. But for now regardless of what I think,  I will be yelled at my team I didn't pick for trying to take 1 group to kill lieutenants before pushing further south ~
---
Define optimal.  I think the problem is that most people are in too much of a hurry to realize that they can have fun with something that isn't about getting to the end result the quickest.  The best things in life can't just be bought or instantly 'had' and if you can't understand that you still have a lot of growing up to do.
---
Even most of his youtube videos has asmons name or face on it. Hes literally a leech.

Yeah I can't wait to get Accuria. That's the one thing I'm really missing out on is rings. Still using Mason's and Princess ring... I should get one of the next 2-3 Accuria's though, so only a matter of time!
---
&gt;If I am forced to live with the consequences of min-maxers on my server, they can be forced to live with mine. 
---
No, they can't. It takes all of five people to report you and get you kicked with deserter. Try this and see how fast you end up back in town with a debuff.

I don't think I even said the phrase private server?

Thank you for your most humble of brags

Simple, /4 and ask the classes you'd like to group up with if they wanna make a premade, go on discord together, and play as a premade, problem solved.

The counterweight is good to know, thanks! Yeah, it shouldn't work. I have heard that +damage was bugged before but only on private servers. Just wanted to be sure I wasn't missing out.

Oh, you could care less? That means you still care somewhat since there's room to care a bit less. I'm flattered ü•∞

I think you were looking for "I couldn't care less."

Nice try, guy.
---
I want to play av not run by every alliance. AV was my favorite bg pre 1.12. it's not just ruining av it's ruining the honor grind people will get r1- r14 w/o killing anybody it's fucking dumb.
---
Nah, the ability to fly away and out of danger as soon as you're out of combat killed wPvP. Lots of wPvP went on during Vanilla even after BGs were released. It's just that it was more natural and organic rather than people trying to farm honor.
---
Ahh I got ya.
---
no thanks.
---
i literally played elysium just for AV, it didn't matter if both sides ignored each other or tried to, because the guards would wipe you out until you grind them down.. and then you had to deal with back cappers and gankers hitting your rear, while you had people in your team doing the same
---
That's exactly /u/nastylep 's point though
---
It is also the fact that Alliance has plate covered healers more likely to survive cleave damage.
---
It seems like Alliance are just engaging the final room faster too.
---
i-dont-want-to-have-to-make-a-premade-to-enjoy-casual-pvp

---
Yeah, but most of it was technical limitations (most pservers don't modify the clients), and obv the game didn't run as smoothly as it runs on classic (which is the legion client).
---
But how they actually managed the game was superior imo. Like for instance in the MC patch, they tried to compensate for the 1.12.1 class and talent changes by reverting the loot table back to an earlier version (which had significantly worse optimalized stats on items), they had the original 8 slot debuff cap, and they tried to un-nerf dungeons as well so it would fit better to the current phase of the game.
---
Blizzard only runs 1.12.1 (like the \#nochangers wanted) which means that most of the content in the game wasn't designed around this patch, which would have brought significant changes to classic at this point.
---
Yeah thankfully i didn't have anything to send and I would only give shit to him in trade if I did at all.  Still a really shitty thing to do, and he's generally known as an asshole, but no one seems to really care.
---
&gt;That's what happens when Blizz caves to the #nochange nerds who then abuse outdated systems.
---
this was the original comment I had an issue with, and you decided to defend. you guys keep blaming the no changes people for everything. it's not our fault people zerg AV, and nothing you have proposed would have stopped the zerg. actually a lot of the no changes people would have chosen the earlier AV version with buffed npc's  - so no changes is a solution not the fault
---
The definition of best is to maximize reward. The difference is what the reward is. I have fun when I am maximizing my character's and my ability in the game. I looked up bis lists, I farmed particular dungeons, I am farming a particular rep, I am following particular paths in order to maximize gold farming, etc. And I have found a community, guild, and friends who share those goals and are fun to play with.
---
There is this false stigma that minmaxers aren't "having fun." This IS fun to us. Setting goals and reaching them. Making our characters as good as they can possibly be for the roles we wish to play. The goal is always fun, or I wouldn't be playing the game.
---
I watched the video, assuming it is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gMqfwmk1H4), but didn't see the joke anywhere in it?
---
People who shout the loudest aren't usually the ones with the most relevant opinion...
---
Any good guides on how to set up macros?
---
Also are there any specific generally good and useful macros for a warlock?
---
I don't try and camp them at the WSG GY, or specifically pick them out in a fight (unless they're a healer).
---
Optimal in the sense of what gains the most honor and reputation.
---
And who are you to define someone else's fun? Who are you to tell someone that they aren't having fun by getting reputation and honor at the fastest rate? Just because that's not fun to you doesn't mean you get to dictate what everyone else finds enjoyable.

Not true. My buddy got a 30 day ban for doing the AFK emote. I know because I was there in discord when he started raging about it.
---
Spam BRD getting whatever BIS gear you can from there, and then when you get 57 or so switch to Scholo and get some great XP.
---
Mmm, give me your hate, it feeds me.  I love seeing the angry of butthurt ignorant retail players.
---
Cool

Uh what? You're putting that in quotes so I'm going to assume you're quoting something. Mind providing us with that something?

Unless you just mean there are NPCs in the BG, in which case, lmao
---
Lol I‚Äôm on my phone, guy. 
---
I hope you get cancer.
---
If only flying mounts weren't a thing I would completely agree.... flying mounts really made the world feel so much less interesting though, and the old world quickly became a ghost town.  
---
that's the main reason I want classic+. classic's itemization, talents, and pvp systems are just... bad.
---
Sounds about right, your level 51, to them your a burden, easier to remove it.
---
\#hoesmad
---
Didn't realize this works as chance on hit doesn't proc for druids. 
---
It might not be a chance on hit, just in combat and target as it doesn't explicitly say chance on hit.
---
"Equip: Chance to strike your melee target with lightning for 200 to 300 Nature damage."
---
No, I specifically left out random battlegrounds. While yes, you certainly display a higher level of skill than people who PvE only, you're still in a battleground with at minimum 19 other players. There is enough there that if you fail to play skillfully your team can still carry you. In Arenas if you fail you are likely to lose.
---
I do but I get killed 20v1

You need people to tank bosses in AV, so prot isn't entirely a waste

---
one kicks you out of the server for 30 seconds and one stops you from doing BG's for 15 mins. 
---
Not saying it should or shouldn't be punishable but they're very different results from the prank. Wasting 30 seconds is nothing compared to being locked out of the thing you wanna do for 15 mins
---
Even though Mages might end up #1 dps in Naxx, guess who is #2? And who is #1 for all tiers before that too...
---
As a Horde player, i'm still not seeing the connection :(
---
youre not getting r14

---
It's a spot in the BRD prison you can aoe farm repeatedly for over 100k xp/hour.
---
It's most common to see mages farming it, but I'd imagine you could do a melee cleave version also the same way people did for SM &amp; ZF though I'm not 100%.
---
It's telling you that it will DE into a large brilliant shard. It's telling you that the value of that large brilliant shard is 2g85s based on auction scanning data. If that value doesn't reflect the value on your server, you need to do an AH scan. Auctioneer seems to be working perfectly in this screenshot. 
---
Not sure about your other add-on.
---
The claw loses to any weapon to you have +skill with.
---
If you have 0 +skill to any weapons, it is pretty good.
---
What gives rep on a loss?  I only had 1 loss last night and it seemed like we got very little rep for it.
---
 Such constructive, much wow. Go back to [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW/)

You don't have direbear form, but warriors are still rocking mail armour too. The lack of direbear isn't really a fair complaint.
---
&gt; they literally look nothing alike.
---
I mean...they're both the same shape, they both glow, they both show the interact button when you scroll on them...
---
the only difference is one is more dark in the center and one shows a blurry city in the center. Other than that they look VERY similar lol
---
join a premade of yours?
---
You just assume every AV starts with a 50/50 chance. Bad news is it doesnt. Alliance have a stong advantage in winning because of non-player factors (the map being a big one.).
---
The best strategy to win AV for horde is actually to defend.
---
The best and most reliable strategy horde strat for honor AND rep grind is to kill balinda and capitalize on alliance mistakes of they fail to zerg.
---
In the end it doesnt matter because my strategy doesnt require 100% cooperation like yours, so I'll continue to do you a favor and kill balinda every game.
---
horde is closer to vann than allies are to drek.
---
if enough of the horde zerg gets to vann and they have the right comp with decent gear, they can win the zerg.
---
this doesn't happen often because even if both sides are equal in gear and numbers, and even with horde getting to boss first, the layout is more forgiving on alliance so more will survive to actually reach the boss
---
Where is this 500 rep for a win coming from?  I think I saw either 300 or 350 for a win last night.
---
a polished turd

&gt; bg doesn't take 2 hours

That's adorable you think that the OG AV could be finished that fast.
---
I agree completely on flying mounts.  I WISH we could get TBC without flying mounts.  I still think it‚Äôs the best version of WoW even with flying mounts, but it definitely isn‚Äôt the perfect version.  
---
I‚Äôm luke warm on the Classic+ idea for a couple of reasons... first, I don‚Äôt see Blizzard actually being willing to do it.  And second I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd trust them to not completely screw it up even if they did.  
---
I guess we‚Äôll see where it all goes.
---
People like to recommend going disc/shadow because they have no idea what they are talking about. I would absolutely recommend going holy/disc (actually, probably heavy disc with holy splashes) with the a mage duo.
---
Don't expect to do a *ton* of dungeon runs in the 30-50 range without a tank in your duo. There's a persistent dearth of tanks in that level range, so be prepared to do a lot of questing/grinding while jumping in/creating the occasional group. If you would like to do a lot of dungeon leveling, make friends with every warr/druid you come across in groups.
---
Priest mage is *very* good. Probably one of the better priest duos, after warr. Priest shields mean there's absolutely no way that the mage will ever have resist issues with aoe farming, and heavy disc means that you get power infusion, which opens up some pretty insane AoE damage for the mage. Mage offers the priest free water, which is pretty nice; and mage ports make leveling much easier at the higher levels. Neither one slows the other down since neither have move speed increases, like with druid or hunter, and both are mana users so it's easy to throw in mana breaks.
---
If you are on a PvP server, this combo is godly. That's a huge amount of CC and tankiness with both those classes, with dots, dispells, shields, roots, fears, heals... everything you could want really. If you are on a pvp server, 100% take the disc PvP talents like improved inner fire and mana burn. Burning out enemy healer mana makes 2v2s a breeze, especially with a mage.
---
As for why shadow is overrated, especially as a duo, and especially as this duo:
---
* Shadow actually kinda sucks till 40/44. Outside of spirit tap, which is a "100% take this or you are fucking up solo leveling" talent, the talents are decent *at best*. Imp. shadow word pain is useless in this comp as nothing will live so long that you need to re-up SW:P consistently, shadow focus is good but nothing game changing, blackout is a PvP talent through and through; same with psychic scream and silence... reach and fade are useless, shadow weaving isn't great as you probably won't even hit 5 stacks on most targets, vamp. embrace is only good once you have shadow form and can't use renew/heal, and darkness is lackluster pre-44.
---
* Mind flay is *bad*. Really bad. Until 44. Why? It's barely any higher DPS than gravestone scepter with wand spec (another "take this or you are fucking up" solo talent), costs mana (unlike wanding), and doesn't let you regen mana. It just isn't very good. At 44, with shadowform, darkness, and the new rank; it becomes decent as some filler dps and great pvp slows to weave around your mind blasts.
---
* Disc is *fantastic* for duos. You're already taking wand spec, imp. shield is great for both you and your duo as a huge "oh shit" button, and later on mental strength, mana burn, PI, and force of will are great with your mage duo. Your filler are all still really good talents, like martyrdom, inner focus, meditation, divine spirit, etc.
---
As for the issues: Mage excels at AoE farming. That's their bread and butter. Solo target dps is OK, but nothing insane, and more importantly it is extremely mana taxing. Priest, on the other hand, can have 100% uptime with spirit tap; so it's actually pretty parasitic to solo kill grind with the two of them. On top of that, priest has no ranged AoE, with their only AoE ability being holy nova which requires a decent holy investment. Being centered on the priest, it's virtually unusable with the mage AoE strategy. Again, on the surface this has very little synergy.
---
*You need to learn how to play around this*. 
---
What priest lets you do is absolutely *insane* mage pulls that would be extremely risky solo. Shield before pull, and then re-shield if it breaks. Pull aggro on any mobs that resist, or on any ranged mobs that accidentally get pulled. Use psychic scream and DoTs to clear out anything that breaks through the blizzard. Use PI on CD. Manaburn casters. If you have it, follow up with some holy novas once most of the pack gets weakened and the mage has plenty of threat.
---
As for profs, I'd recommend going tailoring as a priest; truefaith vestments is too good to pass up and you have little to no use for first aid so you have plenty of cloth to spare. You can drop it at 60 if you like, after you get truefaith, but it still has it's uses if you want to keep it. I would go ahead and grab mining and herb each, and then another prof on the mage; alch would be nice for leveling to give you guys plenty of mana and healing pots, as well as some situationally amazing potions like waterbreathing, swim speed, and free action potions. Alternatively, engineering is always good, or you can go skinning if you want some extra passive gold income.
---
If you are joining AV while queue'ed for WSG it's gonna take longer due to the fact that AV will pop so often. If you join a premade you'll be inside a WSG in less than 10 minutes.
---
It sure was.
---
its not a bug. it's ilterally working as intended
---
I solo q‚Äôd BGs from vanilla through legion without this being a problem so it‚Äôs bullshit that it now is
---
But yeah if this is how things are, ur probably right
---
Yes, except that pile of snow is significantly easier to get to / jump across from.
---
Spell pen exists on Arcanist set right now.
---
Stop hurting me like this!
---
You may not like the rush for bis and min/maxing but that's how the game is played these days after a decade of gameplay refinements. The people expecting a 2005-06 style vanilla experience dont understand the effect of meta-creep. If you do back and look at Counter-Strike or Starcraft meta from 2005 it looks very different from today. The same applies to sports or chess or pretty much any other competitive endeavor. It's impossible to freeze a game in time and expect the meta not to shift as people's understanding of mechanics and strategy develops.  Even if we got the 1.5 AV, it would be zerged in 10-12 minutes instead of 6-7 as pservers proved.  Nothing would change and people would still bitch uncontrollably about AV not matching their precious 2005-06 experience.
---
I do agree with you about one thing though,  PVE items shouldn't be gated behind battleground reputation.  I dont like zerging AV,l anymore than you do, it's just a chore that I have to do to get the gear I need, a chore that I am glad has been made much less painful.  I would much prefer to never step foot in a BG.
---
It's also the 20-29 bracket. So of course the honor values will be lower.
---
Damn this is edgy af
---
na, im king. I bet i smashT, and campT u all dey, every dey. SUTF
---
Exactly right and as more horde players catch on this will be the horde meta. You can't change the fact the map is horrifically favored for alliance to end the game quickly, so just adjust and maximize your honor/rep output.
---
What a nerd
---
Thanks. Yeah, I have the mace, the pants, the boots, the trinket. Did princess on my last run so have access to her loot table going forward. It is a fun instance and can always find a group unlike DM which nobody ever seems to want to run

My understanding is that you need to maintain a specific standing to reach that rank.  As in, you have to be standing 1 for 14 weeks to be able to get that rank, starting from zero.  So if you want R14, you have to be in standing 1.

#SomeChanges
---
I somewhat agree here,  but its not fair to pretend the two demographics are mutually exclusive.  I don't trust blizzard-Activision one bit.  I played nost and elys. I whole heartedly think the endgame difficulty needed to be adjusted to fit blizzard's decision to give us a Frankenstein 1.12 talents + items but we only have to beat MC? Classic was never going to be no changes and blizz told us so from the get go. Small rebalancing is ideal for the games health ( I don't think class balance is that bad,  just the items are and the content was made to test drastically weaker characters than we have now). 
---
Inb4 someone tells me classic was never hard anyway so why care.
---
Or just cancer
---
Ive killed ally on the tram in BC with my mage... but that wasnt really my point.  Was more of continuing the point that horde have guards for their transports and ally do not.
---
Keep questing. You'll the other 12 quickly. No reason to go try to farm it.
---
av is instant
---
There's a few of us out here who's experiencing everything for the first time. Shit I had BG and Arena 3v3 mixed up untill this past weekend since I asked someone could you just 3v3 out in the world instead of having to queue for a instance.
---
Yeah its convient and fast, two things phase 2 honor didnt have. Honorspy is also broken so its impossible to know how far ahead you are, so you just endlessly spam AV and just hope youre still ahead. One upside is it brought a lot of people into the honor system, so there might be more slots in the upper brackets.
---
As Alliance, I hope you keep doing it!  We don't compete with you for honor, so it doesn't matter which faction is gaining more honor!
---
You prolly already have it.
---
&gt; Wasting 30 seconds is nothing compared to being locked out of the thing you wanna do for 15 mins
---
Again, when deodorant shopping, look for the one that says "For Sensitive Skin"
---
And if you're a mage you can blink right through it to the other side!
---
How does being in AV affect the wsg queue?
---
I‚Äôd queued up both ways, just straight up wsg while waiting around/herbing and while I was in AV. 
---
I remember being in one bg and having the queue for the other pop. Is your queue put on hold in vanilla?
---
I feel personally attacked. My staff only has +damage because I needed to level my enchanting
---
no, those summonable npcs from quests are from an older version of AV that only private servers have, i've played a hundred AV's since yesterday and haven't seen any once.  you are wrong
---
Suicide Kings is workin okay for us
---
People in MC reported raids being disbanded by the restart and full trash resets
---
Does the new AV Exalted mount cost gold or Alterac valley marks of honor?
---
Yeah, but there are cases where people click them purely on accident.
---
Good split is probably rattle gore. I'm on horde side and it's pretty even. EPL swaps from alliance to horde all the time, and same goes for Brm. However alliance never beats us on raid days which is Tuesday. The statistics on the alliance vs horde ratio websites states that rattle gore is more alliance (65) but, it feels even to me.
---
Yeah I personally believe blizz maybe messed something up, but also i think about how many more people killing and clearing MC every week, is probably way more than back in vanilla, but thats just my opinion.
---
thats it?
---
We use a class lead based system where tier gear gets loot counciled and shared loot items like rings and weapons get auctioned for DKP. Works really well and keeps everyone happy.
---
Oh my bad
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to premade to enjoy some casual BGs dude.
---
I mean it's inside a battleground, not sure what he expected.
---
Leave then, you clearly are not having fun. This is dedicated to discuss all things WoW Classic. This is WoW Classic related content.
---
You are the MVP. Thank you kindly!
---
Correcto.
---
I mean I guess he's not wrong in that being intoxicated technically isn't good for you, but he lost me wherever he made the connection to gaming.
---
That's why you keep transfers open.  Don't want to wait 2 hours for a BG?  Transfer.  Finally gives incentive.  
---
But Blizzard is literally going out of their way to ensure Classic is a failure so that they can say they were right and promote retail.
---
Druids need armor rings/trinkets/etc and the dire bear form multiplier to beat Warriors in mitigation. You don't beat them before getting dire bear. It's a valid comparison.
---
Fewer snares is irrelevant when you have no movement speed bonuses. Snares can be re-applied until you run out of mana.
---
I am a level 42 paladin and I was wondering what level should I be to tank ZF?
---
AV just came out today, jesus christ, you can't expect everyone to do your bidding, commando.  It's a game, I'm paying for it and i play it however i please as long as im not breaking any rules.  If you wanna do it that way,  FINE.  But don't be toxic about it.
---
0/30/21‚Äìand I don‚Äôt power shift much but mostly bc I‚Äôm a noob and still figuring it out. I‚Äôve tried it but am just not great at it yet.
---
Instead of 6 minute rushes to kill the end boss, there was an actual strategic battle for control of key map points and a back and forth push between the factions, with lots of PVP fighting. It was a blast, and one of my favorite battleground experiences
---
This AV is fun too, just fast. And every now and then you still get a turtle game and it takes longer
---
His eyes are the Soulstone tooltip
---
You're correct in that the math on the upgrade doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things,  but what matters is the impression you give to your officers when in a competitive raiding guild.  Suppose you are a member of your guild's first raid team that is pushing speed run timers and you are heavily competing with other guild members for a spot in the "A" team.  Every other member of your class has gotten their AV upgrade, and several members of the guild's second raid team have also done so.  You are the only guy in the first raid that hasn't.  The impression you give to the leadership in this case is that you have not put in effort on par with most other class members in your guild.  Such things factor into future loot council decisions and roster spots for the speedrunning raid team.
---
No Changes
---
15* don‚Äôt forget the Rune costs money
---
I don't know what you mean? I'm on a heavy pop server with a competitive and active player pool. The only people that seem to be complaining are people who hate min-maxers for some reason.
---
I didnt login for a month and all my Ah stuff expired and was deleted. Lost about 1000g
---
Qpon, the mage from Smolderweb, right? You are doing a service to Alliance everywhere. We love that random free honor at the auction house. Really brightens up our days
---
Ah, interesting. Was this in Classic or retail?
---
Have you thought about fishing?
---
Are you specced into ret? If you have engineering, the bombs and trinkets pretty much make the class. If you're using seal of command (which you should be) make sure you have a weapon that's 3.5 or slower. The slower the better. Also, sacrifice some strength for agility. The difference between 10 and 15% crit is huuuuge.
---
I dont want changes from what was in vanilla, I'm just being picky about which version of vanilla üòÇ
---
I thought you were done. Go away. Shoo, fly.
---
Read the main post, thats how
---
This was retail. It wasn‚Äôt that terribly long ago back in Legion.
---
You don't have to have a premade to enjoy them, just to win them.
---
This is False. You can summon these. Just takes a longer AV, and people to actually turn in the items.
---
It's not the size of the hammer that matters, its the way you brain horde with it. And thanks! It'll certainly get some use out there.
---
Well there‚Äôs not much money to be made in it for the cost of leveling it.
---
I hope they nerf it so you need over 50% of the raid to report.
---
Likewise, as a Herod Horde player I can safely say this sucks. I'd REALLY like to know what the name of the guild that is doing this is
---
I play to win. There have been so many games in vanilla that we came into down 2-0 because alliance give up and afked out, only to rally and win. 
---
It's the best feeling when your premade goes up against another premade and after a back an forth ensues a victor comes out on top.  
---
The realm forums used to have a ton of one guild calling out another for a good WSG, and we kinda lost that with cross realm bgs in Vanilla.
---
I will always play to the end.
---
Yes. Sharpening stones, counterweights, and even weapon damage enchants work for druids in form. Enchants that are chance on hit however will NOT proc.
---
The only procs that work are ‚Äúon melee hit‚Äù such as Hand of Justice or Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom.
---
And also set the default graphics card in wow itself
---
what back door?
---
Exactly! Thanks:)
---
there is a addon totem dismiss. very good
---
Excuse me?
---
You do understand the entire purpose of spell batching, yes?
---
They went out of their way to put in a mechanic that EMULATES LAG like we'd have experienced in 2004.  
---
Now they've thrown out the shittiest version of AV they could pick, and removed the ability to queue as a group.  
---
Perhaps your head is shoved too far up blizzards ass, that you cant see anything other than their bullshit.
---
Come out for a breather, ey?
---
Friend who still plays said that yesterday was the first time ever that he wasn't killed in Searing Gorge, as well as BRM. Everyone at BRM was there for pve and he actually hung out with some horde /wave and /dancing.
---
too risky.
---
A hunter should be able to track him down; they can track stealth and humans. 
---
Then a priest can just MC him, and just jump down.
---
And that still doesn't make one person's story about an insignificant number of games in any way statistically relevant.  Not saying it's not frustrating to lose a stretch in a row - but having one bad afternoon in BGs is absolutely irrelevant to overall tendency of alliance to win AV more than Horde. If you continue losing games, then the only constant is your skill and the general performance of alliance in your battlegroup.
---
its the retail players that infested classic with the same problems from retail
---
References from my two favorite comedy shows.  It‚Äôs a good dal
---
clear your youtube history
---
A pvp mode shouldn't involve pvp "every now and then". If the fundamental gameplay loop has the matches potentially ending with zero kills, then it's a broken pvp system.
---
I like this outlook. Too many people are just rushing to 60 to do raids even though leveling and pvp are more compelling reasons to play the game.
---
Well the difference is that arcanists set was in the game at this point in vanilla just not in its 1.12 state while the av caster ring was not in the game until later
---
Overpowered AF
---
On Earthfury and I‚Äôve literally never experienced this. Every single dungeon I‚Äôve run has been similar to my
---
Vanilla experience only fewer clueless people
---
I've been seeing that macro for so many years, when I first saw it back in Wrath I actually fell for it!
---
Technical limitations aside, the developer teams were notorious for cheating, awarding items to friends, or other scummy behavior.  Whether it was true or not, private servers as a whole have this reputation of fun but not fair.  You also had zero permanence.  You didn't know if the server would be given a Cease and Desist at any point in time
---
If you run premades you can be a crap 1v1 pvper but still be good just by communicating and going to the right places.
---
At least on the Ally side, it's ride straight thru the map, kill 3 NPCs, repeat. It's a total bore
---
Yesterday was a good day even with all the mishaps. Beat asmon in av, our dkp addon broke, severs got reset, fixed dkp addon, got first binding in our guild, got my leg plate of wrath, perd blade dropped, ring of spell power, drillbor. There was more loot but i forgot what else dropped everyone was stoked to have so many good drops last night.
---
ahhh. /doh.
---
On raid day, nothing else matters...
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=299593/don-rodrigos-band-is-not-available-on-alterac-valley-reputation-vendors?webhook
---
Oh that's a cool system. Hadn't seen it before.
---
"Guys, let's tall sign up for Alterac Valley 54"
---
People from the premade sign up to Alterac Valley 54 and the people inside afk reports other players to clear up slot for their friends from the premade to enter.
---
I can't remember what raid addons were called back then... Big wigs?
---
Just tell them that the raid times dont work perfectly for you and you are going to try a different guild and that you are really going to miss them blah blah blah.  Do it before you get some loot so you dont look like you are leaving after you get hooked up.
---
Got ya twice lol.
---
Are you worried you might be bored/raid log now that this grind is done? According to what I've read/heard from blizzard devs, they design these as grinds so players don't just rocket through it and get bored.
---
ty for the info!
---
Was nothing to read, nor any pointers at the map. So, the thing is memory, I don't remember how I got to Pandaland
---
Is it not? (Genuine question)
---
AV for lvl 29? Huh?
---
No. This change means Blizz will immediately shove LFR and sharding into Classic the next week, and next thing you know BfA is integrated into Classic because mUh sLiPpErY sLoPe.
---
\^ a peak into the last remaining few "#nochanges" crowd's rigid and stubborn minds.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôve been seeing people from TL guild on Herod afk a lot in AV
---
Is there a reason for them doing this or pure oversight??
---
AV is obviously not just pvp. It‚Äôs PvEvP. Sorry you don‚Äôt like it how it is, but that‚Äôs how it is.
---
A few mages and hunters negate this strategy so easily.
---
I guess you just don't know what you're talking about :)
---
Not at the same time, and not from that far away.
---
Track human and it would be impossible to tell where he is due to the massive amount of overlapping blips on the map.
---
If you're using ElvUI, this only works if you disable the bag module first, so that all your bags are separated instead of having the one huge bag.
---
you're right, it was false, it also happens in retail's 1.5 AV
---
Exactly, they really ruin the new player‚Äôs first impression if BGs.
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/42301

Most groups I see now intentionally throw the game as we down balinda and all the named folks just to make it faster, it's ridiculous, but really effective
---
Love tinytooltip. Although it will only place info in bottom right when in combat. Might be an option you can change, idk though.
---
Exactly. The public schools here should replace the part on the sign that reads "School" and replace it with "Idiot factory".
---
I know that free action potions exsist. I was mad because of the shit I ran into above. I ran out in this instance. I‚Äôm combat rouge
---
Lollllll
---
Pay it forward.
---
This was against the EULA in vanilla
---
new meta? 
---
you mean the exact same shit we were doing in AV 12 years ago?
---
@ 60, you have a plethora of gear choices, more abilities at your disposal, and a full talent tree 
---
@ 19, you have twink gear and a gimped ability set
---
Pretty sure you original comment was "i would not mess with **us**"
---
Go to any Call of Duty thread
---
Did i say i didnt play wsg ?
---
While I don‚Äôt agree with this practice I find odd I cannot queue with my friends
---
I wpvp for the fun of it since I'm not insane enough to try for high brackets
---
It's an ally group that's lead by a super toxic person that's known. But sharing the name would be witchhunting so. Although it's becoming more common
---
Can‚Äôt relate, not horde scum :/
---
I‚Äôm a Tauren. How does having Obsidian Edge Blade affect my hit chance? I have 308 weapon skill with swords because of its equip bonus. Does skill over 300 matter for weapons?

Crusader on both for hemo

We‚Äôve gotten two (and completed) Hand of Rags.   Not a single BRE or even Spinal.  
---
Also got the Garr binding (twice) 
---
Sad times :(
---
I'm getting what I need and going back to wpvp events on my server, way more fun
---
So....you decided to be assholes that showboat and make it take longer for a group of disorganized pugs to move on?
---
Cool.
---
How about this crazy idea,
---
Blizzard hires people to actually look into reports of people afking and take appropriate action instead of letting players self police in a system where they are competing against one another.
---
Don't really recommend rock elemental's from badlands, Elemental earth has a low drop rate.
---
Unless you can kill multiple at once (as a mage they are spaced out far enough where it is a pain in the ass to do a proper aoe group pull/wipe) or kill very quickly it is not worth it.
---
On my level 42 warlock geared out warlock I can kill 2-3 a min and only have 2-5 seconds of downtime between each pull. (depending on how far the next one is)
---
In an hour I can get between 4-7 elemental earth. Most of my money comes from selling the grey vendor trash they drop.
---
You would make more money farming human mobs near your level for big pulls, silver and sell-able loot.
---
The only reason I am doing badlands for elemental earth is because there is no other farm I can do for decent money (small flame sacs have too low of a drop rate and half of the red whelps are immune to shadow damage so I have to spam searing pain) 
---
Farming leather is not profitable at this level as I have to kill a minimum of 20 and sometimes I will not get thick leather. 
---
If I was horde I would be doing the crawfish/shellfish quest farm turn in thing in Desolace for 50s a turn in or whatever it is.
---
Alternatively you can sell some portals while farming, just make a macro for /general that offers portals for mat price + tip.
---
Not really, no. They spawn right there and the same chokes slowing horde down make defense the only option.

I don't understand why people are expecting MC to be challenging. It's literally the first raid in the game, it's designed to be entry-level. It's 15 years old and everyone knows the raid inside and out, and yet, still whines that it's too easy.
---
Giving bosses more health won't make it harder, it will just make it take longer. Giving bosses more damage won't make it harder, it will just make raids take a couple more healers.
---
MC was never hard, people were just noobs.
---
In your opinion. 5 min rushes without any pvp is not my idea of fun for a PVP battleground.....
---
I don't think quite on the same level, because a large chunk of those who PvP for fun will be in the Battlegrounds.
---
you are fully capable of engaging in pvp at any time.
---
Thanks, you just gave me a great idea.  I'm gonna turn all these games into 20m+ :)
---
Interested in buying a bloodrazor as a sword spec rogue, have thrash blade as well (level 49 atm), how long would bloodrazor last me until I start raiding? It's currently 42g and I would plan on enchanting it with fiery as well. I heard of Mirah's song as well but that's at 56 or 58?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9C9OKMyZng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9C9OKMyZng)
---
Not just win, but win with Max honor. Belinda, towers, etc and still beat ac to race in 8 min? I do not believe it can be done. There simply is not enough time.
---
PvP players acting shitty? I am shocked
---
horde have already adapted. they are now cutting off all the 60% mounts and ally are wiping 75% of their zerg rushes. they defend and win
---
I wish I had enough assets to lose 1000g :(   I need to start farming for my epic... funny because this is the same procrastination I did back in the day lol: "Oh, I'll get around to the mount, but LOOK at all these BGs and dungeons to run, oh boy!"
---
queues are instant. go pvp for a bit. round is over in 7 minutes, queue up, go pvp for bit. repeat.
---
Whiney twink babies on a PvE server?  Whoa.... hit me right in the laugh box!
---
i played all of vanilla so i decided to try classic a couple months ago. ended up quitting cuz i don't have zero responsibilities anymore, but i'd def noob it up in chat for handouts.
---
"where can warlocks get wands? i heard they help w leveling", bam free wand.
---
"where can a lvl 10 buy more backpacks?" and i'd usually get a low level tailor happy to share a couple linen boiz :)
---
Does this work with rogue poisons? It's rather annoying to have to buy 5 full stacks of dust for a single full stack of instant poison vi.
---
What? I'm in America and I've always spelt it judgement.
---
This is what happens when people want to play together in a MMO,  and find out they have been restricted from doing so by blizzard.
---
If there's another way they can, they will.
---
Just allow AV premades, and match them against other premades for fucks sakes.
---
Those addons along with castbars addons are basically cheating in classic.
---
You were not suppose to be able to see enemy buffs (unless you were a mage) or what people were casting. When the devs actually designed the game they planned for people to use their eyes and look at the character they were fighting, and notice when they were starting to channel their spells.
---
640 gold.
---
800 gold base price multiplied by 0.8 (20% exalted discount)
---
I've done about 10 so far and only lost 1 when alliance tried to get galv instead of zerging. 
---
The BG favors alliance, the graveyard placement and the bridge and tower guards favor them. Those are just facts. It's not like they have to win every single time though even with an advantage.
---
For a lot of people right now the purpose of av is to get exalted/ranks for the epics so it's working great. WSG is for pvp.
---
I actually enjoyed the other dude‚Äôs post you are trying to parody. This is just uninspired, tired, and not at all amusing.
---
good ol school way. queue for the same number.
---
The difference between a raid geared 60 and a fresh one is *tiny* compared to the difference between a fully enchanted twink and a leveler, what are you smoking?
---
it is a rep reward..
---
this is why we didn't want right-click report in classic. wasn't in vanilla...
---
Your trinket has a 5 min cd
---
Yeah, Idk why people are complaining. This is literally the free market at work. You may undervalue your mat but eventually the market will stabilize with the average amount of throughput and demand. It just takes time to hit that equilibrium.
---
I think a lot of it is, Blizzard has the naive confidence that they did it before, they are still running WoW, so how hard can it be?
---
Blizzard really needs to have a public dev team to look at their decisions and work out what the best way forward should be and what things need to change.  We've already had some alterations, spy addon nerfed, guard aggro extended, etc.
---
Not only that, now that the stream is over the link goes nowhere...
---
the issue isn't AV farm groups, the issue is the moibs are too weak. This is tbc AV. Not Original Vanilla AV&gt;
---
Maybe I should rephrase my question.  I'm looking for PERSONAL buff / debuff addons.  
---
Default player icons for buffs and debuffs are fugly with my current UI.
---
People in CoD complain about spawn killing and camping. WoW Players complain about everything under the sun.
---
too soon, right? oh, the humanity
---
yea why
---
should start doing this to premades lol
---
Does Balinda/Galv honor get added at the end of the game? Or is it just the first one to kill either of them who gets honor?
---
Im sure all 4 of the people on there are pretty upset.
---
They added batching because large segments of the community asked for it, numbnuts. 
---
I have no love for Blizzard, but the game is just shitty in a lot of ways and you losers can't accept it. 
---
They ain't sabotaging their own game. They want you to give them money.
---
You should at least do the gear quests if you want to use the rewards for the rest of your rep grind.
---
Such low-life scumbags.
---
When they actually play. 
---
Nobody really bothered to complain anymore after pandaland wow though from the people I know they just discarded it as a terrible game.
---
Yeah, fuck those people for just choosing the faction they like and not researching the server population on websites that are not accurate anyway.
---
People nowadays seem to have minmax OCD. If there's a way to do something 5% more effective, but 90% less fun, they will go for it.
---
Our guild has gotten 6 Mageblades and not a single binding or recipe.... any recipe.
---
Weird, Im actually AFK and never gotten kicked
---
this is exactly what it was in vanilla... 
---
why is everyone acting surprised? and how does it effect you?
---
I wanted to pvp, so i joined AV  and picked up the stragglers on the back of the opposing factions zerg.   pvp'd for 7 min, then the game was over, and i insta queued up again, and did it again. 
---
unless they went back to the super old 1.05 version of AV or whatever, it's not going to be some 5 hour battle. it'll be a 7 min zerg 90% of the time and a 30 min turtle fest the other 10%
---
Thank you.
---
Raid takes about 50min with 30min prep time so not too bad.
---
I just want to play with people I know, sorry if that's been happening to you.
---
It's actually a bit bullshit to say it's only PvP servers. The VAST majority of players I've encountered while running semi AV premades are people wanting to full rush for drek. Aka just for rep. For people that want honor, and likely the ones that care about PvP itself it's a shittier honor farm.       
---
Tldr: blame the people that are rep farming PvE items
---
What class shod I play if I want a romantic adventurer swordsman that is lost in thought/dreams, melancholic, but still capable of grace and wants to be strong and safe?
---
Progression is the best part. Do what you wish. I run a Guild we have absorbed a few smaller guilds and we used to be in the same boat. take 3 hours just to get to Domo. Now we have MC on Farm and do MC/Ony in 1 night which takes 2.5hours and going faster everyday and for me... Since its my Guild i can't be more proud! Although you have a fair case if you want to progress more.. Try suggesting getting the Ubrs buff...  it will help big time and i bet you will one shot it Since its FR heavy. Generally it takes 20 minutes to get. Then just run back in buff up have Firepots and Let him go. We killed him after submerge but still was worth
---
I feel like a well balanced game can easily make it to about 1hour. There are constant pushes/defenses back and forth that can be sabotaged, etc. Flag caps are mainly about capitalizing on the mistakes of the enemy team, in a balanced game.
---
There's also the cooking trainer in stormwind. Thomas &lt;cook&gt;. Took me 15 years to notice that one as well.
---
Well glad i got the baron one outa the way last night. Atless loot still says 3% for both
---
did you not play AV later in vanilla?  this isn't a new thing... 
---
this is happening exactly as it did after AV got revamped in vanilla.
---
By the time we get phase 5, this ring will be obsolete, which is why this is stupid and pointless.
---
Meh yeah i guess so.
---
To be fair, the offhand is really really fucking good. Blizzards fault for making a ton of bis pve gear come from pvp and vice versa
---
alcoholism.
---
Blue collar slave mentality at it's finest. You've been trained so well, you are not telling others that this is the right way. lol sad
---
There is no exalted discount in vanilla, I believe that was added in TBC. You can get 10% for honored  and 10% from pvp rank 3.
---
Back in TBC made portals to Deadwind pass instead of Shattarah. :P good old days!!! But, I didn't remembered anyone calling me a griefer back then. I think peoples mentality has changed... very much.
---
Stop being so ragey and people would be more receptive to your thoughts, I‚Äôm sure you have good ones to share.
---
Oh you‚Äôre just jealous!  :)
---
Problem with loot council is its either way too fair and you get people who get something for free and quit or youre sort of unfair with loot and keep your core happy so they dont quit.
---
DKP obviously has that problem as well with dkp dumping but they run off with 1 item as opposed to 10+ items. Too many horror stories of tanks getting geared only to quit and join a more serious guild.
---
And if people want to do the quests? You zergers don't own AV

CLASSIC
---
Combined with the falsely reporting me out of the BG I think it's safe to say it's griefing.
---
What happened? You got kicked from the raid so you were removed from av? You can do that?
---
Is wind seeker fairly new?
---
Or, now hear me out, they wanna play with their friends and don't see this as such a big deal/don't realize they could get into trouble for it.
---
Yes it does matter. Because not every AV is a shit race. And not everyone is doing AV. So if someone is doing an efficient premade in wsg they‚Äôll actually make more honor than you assuming you‚Äôre simply on av teams that rush van. But if you‚Äôre killing the objectives and getting like 3500 per 12 minute match you can almost keep up. Inversely if you‚Äôre comparing between two pugs on the same faction and pug one gets a ton of av matches where he wins 3500 per game in 12-14 minutes and pug two gets a ton of games where he wins 900 per 8 minute game than pug one will be getting more honor. This honor difference is the difference between receiving standing 1-5 and obtaining bracket 14 and obtaining standing 30 and receiving bracket 11. 
---
You need to maximize honor gains even amongst your own faction and people will start to work this out in a week or two once they go ‚Äúwtf I‚Äôve played nonstop how come I only got 35th this week‚Äù
---
There is literally no reason to do the quests. They give 100 rep each, every time you win you hey around 500. Zerging drek every 6min is the best way to farm honor and rep. If you disagree you are just wrong.
---
Hunters get 2H mace + ring
---
Warriors get 2H mace + shield + ring
---
Rogues get dagger + ring
---
Casters get off hand.

Casuals complaining about how hardcore players are playing 'their' game, what's new?

Imagine going to an internet forum with hundreds of thousands of people and telling them that only your definition of fun is the valid one

51 mage horde here... Is BG xp decent? I am burned out of farming ZF
---
&gt; I whole heartedly think the endgame difficulty needed to be adjusted to fit blizzard's decision to give us a Frankenstein 1.12 talents + items
---
Your words.
---
And my response, giving bosses more health won't make it harder, it will just make it take longer. Giving bosses more damage won't make it harder, it will just make raids take a couple more healers.

&gt; I wanted the 2019 internet with 15 years of experience to utterly break this game and figure out the easiest and best ways to do everything
---
i can't tell if this is sarcasm  
---
if it isn't, i actually can't wrap my head around it
---
That just means you don't like AV.  
---
Old AV is something a lot of people were looking forward to and it sucks that these 7min nothing games is what we get.
---
So much this
---
I'll enjoy my dreamland that is TBC. Not many Servers were out there that gave me a good ol' TBC vibe. Netherwing was perhaps the closest, but I missed that train due to personal mishaps and didn't get past level 48. Right after, I'll join you and bring some extra popcorn.
---
Gang gang
---
Considering how expensive water is at higher levels, I think you'll be burning significantly more than 1-2g per level.
---
Melee get weapons AND a ring.... Casters get an off hand.  Do you see the difference?
---
I mean that is how it starts.  1000 paper cuts.
---
Or he can just play classic wow. I hear BGs only take 5 minutes.
---
OR you could have the longer-style AV which would STILL be better honor/hour than wPvP zergfests.
---
Idk I think league might have you
---
Yeah no shit, they haven't made one SINGLE good decision regarding classic wow. Anytime they had a choice to push something they made the worst possible choic.
---
I see. Guess I should reroll a wand user after all. Thanks for the help!
---
I too show my dominance by pressing X over and over feeling my ego and dick harden by taking pixel fights more serious than life.
---
You have to PVE for a whiff of a chance at decent gear anyway, so this seems fitting
---
Hunters can't use mace.
---
You'd think so, right?
---
AV is inherently broken and not fun. After I get the rewards I will no longer play it. If they made it fun to play normally I would play it the way they "intended".
---
I  LOVED the AV that lasted for days... I miss it. The zergfest is a shitshow.
---
Call of Duty community would like a ~~smack~~ talk with you

I suppose, just seemed strange to me that after only 4 raids we had both, guess it was just lucky, oh well to our other tank lol
---
Earthfury. Aka heartseeker lite. 
---
Any horde guilds want a challenge at all in the open world, transfer to Earthfury.
---
I mean, his comment is pointing out that horde have to farm honor because all other horde are farming honor. In response to your comment that honor gain is only meaningful as it compares to your own faction members.
---
What's irrelevant? It's circular but sadly probably true for horde on competitive pvp realms.
---
My condolences.

---
Well I don't care about difficulties that are more objective like mechanical skill,  because the game doesn't emphasize that.  But I dont think the fact that were got phase 1 raids built to be a gear, consumables,  and composition check,  while ALSO getting insane 1.12 items and talents should be waved off as irrelevant.
---
Trick is to find a just mildly sweaty guild who still like having a laugh, so you still get content down but it‚Äôs still good times
---
I did not say that wasnt a valid sample size. I said wowhead did not carry over the original drop rate % from classic, they reset the database.
---
But yes 10,000 isnt a valid sample size for an item with a 1-2% drop rate. That‚Äôs probably why it is skewed, unless it is meant to be that way. There are other things like this too, like it saying elemental fire drops from the imps in burning steppes at a moderate drop rate... when it doesnt and is confirmed by many comments
---
derp. touche
---
They don't have to be elites, there's some 59+ non elites that can drop it too i believe but the drop rates so low it isn't worth trying to farm.
---
Mage is the hero class of vanilla
---
Why does it matter though? Who seriously thinks they‚Äôre going to make rank 13 or 14? You can get to rank 10 playing pretty casually in wsg. I think you‚Äôre right, just have fun with it.
---
Blizzard borrowed from everything.
---
I run curse of exhaustion, which I would recommend, but the hydra can be feared as well, and won‚Äôt aggro anything else. Might be tough to get the fear off without Rotgrip catching you too early though...
---
We remember Rag taking 150 days to die before too.
---
Only the ring isn't super replaceable by raid gear. The caster OH are the best rep reward items from AV.
---
There‚Äôs a built in timer you can use: If you don‚Äôt self-buff a weapon enhancement when you‚Äôre twisting you can keep track of how long is left on the WF buff from WF totem based on how long it has left on your weapon. Said another way, it shows up next to your other buffs and counts down from 10s to 0 with WF totem pulsing every 5 seconds to refresh it. Obviously this won‚Äôt show up if you‚Äôve buffed yourself with 5 mins of WF/rockbiter/frost brand/etc.
---
Yea I think you are trying to push some bull shit that pure damage items aren't good in PvE PuGs because of some myth that you might take a big chunk of damage.   
---
People want PvE BiS because they want to perform as best as possible in PvE. Pretty easy to understand bud. Not really fascinating at all.
---
How are people getting so many ingot drops?  Lucky fuckers.
---
Misinterpreted (reading text does that) my bad.
---
Or they'll dress their characters in total clown suits to gain 5% more DPS. I gotta look gooood. Then Ill worry about the damage.
---
Well I don‚Äôt use it on computer though
---
Right now I am extremely close to bis across the board and I am a 9/11/31 spec rn for pvp and I‚Äôm going to Raid with it as well and I‚Äôve loved it

No I wont be grinding it past exalted. Ill be done and having fun in wsg.
---
Your too optimistic. On the EU tickets have 5 day queues and then get closed without comment. I assume they auto time out?
---
Classic is fine.
---
What was nochanges wrong on? They didn't tell blizz to make the servers too large, they didn't tell blizz to launch with too few and use layering, they wanted the earlier version of AV not this current one.
---
DUDE we were like 5 trash pulls from the first boss last night: SERVER SHUTDOWN 15 Minutes!
---
&gt;What are the odds Blizz listened to the no change crowd vs the odds that "no changes" is just the cheapest option to bring the game back?
---
It was probably both, but don't forget that \#nochanges movement was massive back then before the game was released. It was spammed everywhere and spearheaded by the biggest influencers on twitch. 
---
&gt; is an intentional strategy to get people to try Shadowlands.
---
That would be insanely dumb by Blizzard I think, as the games are almost completely different at this point, and appeals to a different playerbase.
---
At least in my case the best thing Blizz could do (in order for me to stay subscribed) would be to keep Classic healthy so I could play it 95% of the time, and whenever shadowlands was released or had patch updates I would play it for a few weeks maybe. As I don't think retail has any replayability at all (again, its a much different game) but then I could at least try out the patches to see the story etc.

48% before submerge is awful. Most pug groups do far, far better than that. That really shouldn't happen in any scenerio. Either the raid leader or most of the players are severely incompetent.
---
Sucks you're leaving a group of people you enjoy playing with. But you need the right decision leaving.
---
damn, it appears with no one to wand scarlet crusaders to death they've finally overtaken brill...job and life, forgive me, but i'll have to go all out. just this once.
---
Yeah the difference is the OH is significantly better than any of the Melee rewards.
---
People are so LaZy.
---
You are correct it is phase 5.
---
I.....don‚Äôt get it?
---
You can stack them in your bank though. Didn‚Äôt know if it would be worth holding on to them though since AB isn‚Äôt out yet so you can‚Äôt do the turn in with all 3 for extra honor.
---
It‚Äôs a shame you can only go so far back in your previous comments, because I got downvoted to oblivion by those idiots for suggesting that blindly releasing 1.12 MC was a mistake for the long term health of the game.
---
1/2 my guild was raid logging on the 3rd week of MC because it requires absolutely nothing else besides showing up to clear it.
---
But that's still an awful strategy, as it curbs honor per hour massively by turning 15 min AV matches into 45 min AV matches. Instead, you see a ton of groups zergin belinda instead and clearing towers, getting 3.5k honor per match and just accepting the loss; but still getting 2x the honor of the allies.
---
The issue with current AV is that there is *zero* motivation to actually win, if it doesn't give you more xp/hr compared to runs that lose.
---
I juggled back and forth between PvP and PvE when I started playing. I really wanted to play PvP because I had such fond memories of open world PvP. I ended up going PvE because I didn't want my experience to be in the hands of other players. I can't tell you how grateful I am that I did it. Especially with all the nonsense going on right now.
---
I would go Priest. Every group I get in, I breathe a sigh of relief when I see that we have a priest healing. We have some really good Holy Paladins in my guild, but their Pre-raid BiS/BiS gear makes them look like weird clothies anyway. Not only are they phenomenal healers, but you will do well in PvP on YOUR terms as shadow or disc.
---
Horde absolutely can win, but they need a few people to hang back and once alliance charge in to kill our boss, you come in behind them, recap first aid, and wipe their raid. Once you break their advantage horde are suddenly in a much better position to win
---
"of the Eagle" greens are going to have less overall stats and armor than equal level blues, making you even weaker.
---
If I wanted to solo queue I would do a Hunter or Rogue. Warriors are pure team support @ 19. Their damage is shit, all they can really do is Hamstring, use Rend on Rogues, and run flags.
---
I think technically the better timing would have been a few days after release but that takes vacation days to do so /shrug
---
There is literally no reason to do any quests ! Just dungeon grind to 60 ! Who reads the quest texts anyway !?
---
Good, died four times getting from Menethil to Theramore after a long day of work and just logged.
---
Not spending my time off corpse running to feed some kids honour.
---
Except this is still less rep an hour than letting alliance win and queueing faster. I'm not a PVPer, I hate this meta for AV but they gated really good PVE gear behind AV Exalted so I feel like I have to grind it before they nerf zerging. I am not having fun this week :(
---
The main takeaway I‚Äôve learned from this sub is that no matter the state of the game, people always bitch.

in 2 games i played both was 1.2k bonus. w/0 honor from kills. 1 game was 9 mins other 12. Bonus honor is less in av, but av games can (had around 40 min game) be faster, althou you dont nearly get as much honor from kills then you get in wsg. I didnt replay coz I did not had (and still dont) have hard data, I havent compared honor before and after games. Once I do for 1h wsg and 1h av i will compare and make post. will tag u in
---
Still. I'm trying to understand what exchange happened between OP and the premade. He states himself that hes just tryna play the meta and rush drek, but he was specifically targeted by this group because "they didnt like him". Suggesting now that blizzard needs to get involved
---
I dont buy it that a premade group is going around maliciously targeting strangers and getting them kicked from bgs and our op wasnt an innocent bystander. His post sounds like crocodile tears lol
---
If we had proper AV (without this rush nonsense) then what you're doing would be valued a lot more for the war effort. But hey if that's what ya wanna do, more power to ya, grats on your rep man!

Ive heard a lot of rumblings that Shadowlands is a big revamp, level squish, all that. So IDK if retail now can be compared to it. My guess is that it wont change too much, and theyre over stating it. But yea, idk!
---
Because people enjoy the games and could give two shots about honor farming?  I know it's a weird concept.
---
Conspiracy theory: blizz intentionally released this version of AV to imprison the wPvP servers in the "most efficient way to grind honor" which will never end due to too many other ppl getting the same amount of honor.
---
Same tbh

Well I wouldn't go so far as rerolling, but just try to take advantage of the resources at your disposal and get some conjured water. I leveled my mage to 60 and I would get whispers all the time from strangers who just wanted some water. Most mages will craft you some if you ask politely!
---
The people asking for no changes were too dumb to notice the warning we got almost a year ago about which version was coming.
---
Theres literally a 9 month old post on the forum telling you its this.
---
Nah I'm ok. Long AV is the most fun.
---
That one dude they employ isn‚Äôt enough. Knowing blizz he‚Äôs probably unpaid
---
Reminds of how idiots claim the lack of group compositions in M+ competitions was proof that the classes where horribly balanced. While I have plenty of complaints about class balance ,I acknowledge that if formula A is .36% better than all other formulas ,the majority if all not all competitive players will only use A
---
Not gonna lie, did chase my own faction member for a while trying to kill em because i couldnt tell the difference. Im fairly certain this never used to be the case. Ive always been colourblind but dont recall having this issue in vanilla.
---
Christmas is a bad time for us red greens
---
Im glad to see someone else feel that way. Getting jumped by a guy while questing or running afoul of a small gank squad is one thing, but an entire raid's worth of people camping flight points just to snipe people should have been banworthy.
---
This is how they're controling it lol, blacklisting isn't worth shit if the best way to get honor is to farm 5 min AVs that anyone can do. 
---
It only works when premade WSG is the best, because then they lock you out of your servers top premades. 
---
In the current system it's just going to be them kicking you from every AV.
---
Welcome to Classic - there was plenty of feedback provided to Blizzard during development &amp; Beta, but they chose to ignore this issue. It's a problem for the Classic community.
---
Druid is most in demand and has no gear competition.
---
None of the classes you mentioned will have low competition on gear.
---
If you want a caster DPS lock would fit the bill too.
---
Well yeah I know that's a solution but I'm already gimping my already bad DPS enough being a hybrid totem / healbot that can dual wield hahaha
---
and still it is 100 times better than what any of the "devs" of private servers has managed to regurgitate over the years.
---
AV is instant que for Alliance.
---
The ring is replaceable but requires 2 upgrades to replace it. Good luck getting 2 rings before everyone gets one.
---
I'm pretty sure right now it's incorrect but yeahh
---
This is incredibly disappointing behavior.
---
Sucks I can only downvote you once.  You're mentality is the problem here.
---
He's being paid with EXPERIENCE
---
Yeah, this is what I try to do in AV. Also picking off stragglers is fun. Only played 9 AV yesterday and 7 of those were sub 10 minutes zerg fest easily won by Ally. The other two were 20 and 30 minute matches and were much fun.
---
I think many problems of classic exist because the playerbase changed that much over the years. In my opinion tbc fits more with how players tend to enjoy the game right now especially pvp. Arenas are way more rewarding in terms of actual skill. World pvp is a mess because everybody tries to minmax honor etc.
---
(And I rly rly want to play my boomkin from back in the day)
---
TBC content was easy by the end due to these factors:
---
1) You could get t5 badge gear for basically every slot/spec, by the last patch of TBC.
---
2) You could get T6 level badge gear for several important slots by then as well.
---
3) All raids were nerfed several times in terms of boss damage and mechanic severity. 
---
4) Attunements were removed. 
---
5) ZA also provided good T5+ level gear for many classes and specs.
---
I can‚Äôt imagine blizz launching TBC in a state where items 1, 2, 4, or 5 are a factor at all. They‚Äôd likely phase gate those. So we‚Äôd see, say, T5 attunements getting removed by phase 2/3. T5 badge gear come out with ZA, etc.
---
Item 3 may or may not still be left in. But that‚Äôs a tricker one to pin down. Iirc there were at least 2-3 official versions of Vashj, one of which was close to being unbeatable. Same with archimonde. 
---
Even in their easiest form though, they‚Äôd require attunements, gear from previous instances. Etc. 
---
So, unless they release the 3.0.1 versions of these raids, I‚Äôd imagine they will still be challenging.
---
Yo theres something about those mounts that really take away from the game. Im with you on that part. They're huge and obnoxious and you cant go anywhere without being run over by an orc on a motorcycle. Just doesnt feel like a high-fantasy game anymore judging by what Ive seen.
---
The problem is 5 people can report you as AFK and you get booted without the system checking at all.
---
Welcome to one of the worst and most abused additions to any game ever.
---
I mean, playing this game for any extended period of time could be a bad habit, depending on your life. 
---
I think my point is that deciding that some arbitrary amount of effort/time should be the maximum amount that you are required to put in, in order to access whatever rewards you are after is... oddly arbitrary, considering the entire game revolves around it. Plenty of casual players will NEVER have full BIS gear, or full raid gear, etc etc. 
---
Should they then be able to decide on an even lower amount of required effort? 
---
If you can‚Äôt put in that much time/effort healthily (most normal people can‚Äôt) then just don‚Äôt. Play the game without it.
---
Damn son all I see is shitty rogue Druid and shammy tier pieces, still haven‚Äôt even MS rolled on anything in MC yet, lucky guy
---
An unskilled player will wont manage mythic raiding even if they put in 10 hours a day, but an incredibly skilled player wont manage it either if they only put in an hour a day.
---
Yeah, the initial 70 rush in TBC is awesome, when you have so much shit to do and all the attunements, all the rep. Aldor/scryer etc.
---
But it just won't last as long with the current playerbase, and this is also represented on TBC servers which struggles to maintain ther playerbase after this phase.
---
It just goes from a fuckton of content to do to a huge stall real fast, and thats why I don't really want to play it.
---
You leave me out of this
---
Not when killing them sends them back on defense to stop the zerg
---
How bad is the twink situation in the level 19 WSG bracket? Was thinking of trying to run it on my warlock alt this weekend. 
---
And any idea how many rounds approximately it might take to get rank 2?
---
Nice, simple writeup. Thanks!
---
Was the stormpike mount available for purchase once you hit exalted, if so what was the price?
---
Hey man I just read this whole chain and you come off kind of crazy in like an "old man yells at cloud" kind of way. Druids are the best FC at 19 and it's by a large margin. I get that you're hyper focused on this mana thing and comparisons to high level but actual twinking experience tells us all otherwise.
---
You must be trolling or not know how to use google. Every resource available and every person in this thread is explaining to you that druids are hands down best FC. but you wont accept it. I understand at this point admitting you‚Äôre wrong would be too embarrassing but on the off chance you would have an open mind, what piece of information would change your mind on this topic?
---
I was in one where a guy was calling people out based on their map position...
---
Oh really ? ü§î
---
This game will not die this century, probably not the next either. Unless something changes society in a drastic way. Classic is the best, the closest and the most perfect recreation of vanilla there has been so far. By a LONG shot.
---
Solved. Ty.... Now only the 0 for the buff and port reagents is a bit hindering to me but whatever
---
You summed up how I feel about this situation!
---
They ordered everyone to kill content that would give more honor bonus, the raid said no.  They then started trash talking the raid.  I told them to knock it off.  They voted to kick me because I told them to knock it off and focus on killing the faction boss.  Like someone else pointed out, this was not the raid voting to remove a problem player.  This was a group of friends in a pre-made being toxic and exploiting game mechanics.
---
Im playing AV right now and i like it!?? lol
---
Problem is AV is the best honor/hr available, even over WSG premades (horde side at least) so rankers still want to maximize honor gain. Any serious player will hit exalted before the end of the weekend, the rep comes pretty steadily. The main focus for many is to not lose standing to those who are honor grinding more efficiently than you.
---
And the OH isn't replaced until Aq for most people seems pretty fair to me.
---
How bad is the grind to get to rank 13? I'm seeing a bunch say the chest is BIS for bear tanks for a while.
---
I too apologize if I was too harsh. I agree. Sadly it seems Blizz can't and/or won't provide a fix for this situation and its on the players to cut the losses. But looking at my playtime I just feel bad for everyone that has to make that call.

Still would.

Yeah, plenty of people did that, and lost too. That's because stacking resilience was what bad players did. Chances are if you found that frustrating or difficult it was because like them, you too were bad. From the creation of resilience to the time it was removed most top PvP players still stacked a hefty amount of raid gear, which didn't have resilience on it.

Actually countering my points instead of insulting me and saying "everyone else says it's true, you must be wrong!" :)
---
Yeah, so not BIS for Rogues then.
---
Yeah if you are in a raid and someone mentions summon, you‚Äôre just fighting the raid orgy to get your mouse to show a gear.
---
If we just agreed with the premise that they are at the top based on time played and not skill level, why would they necessarily waffle-stomp players that are better than they are?
---
I do literally none of those things. But other people do those things. Blizzard keeps making changes that promote these things. 
---
All the big brain folks are over here blaming #nochanges folks, but since when did classic allow 5 people to abuse afk reporting to kick folks from BGs?
---
Yeah slow rolling a stomp game is bad sportsmanship
---
That would be a correct impression. I was all about objectives in vanilla. I'd gather corpses to summon the soldiers, attack and defend towers, recap graveyards, all that. It was a blast, and somebody had to do it. Not once was I ever told I wasn't contributing. Before zerging was the meta, that's how horde on my server played the game. Cross-faction was a big change however.
---
Sweet, I'd love me a 50 min game tonight with a couple of brewskies
---
Kicking people from your party will serve nothing but to slow your honor. Everyone queuing for the same bg # would also do that. If they are trying to maximize honor they are doing a terrible job of it
---
True, thank you
---
Eh, time is just the barrier to entry not the end-all-be-all.
---
Like, even if you spend 18 hours a day in BGs you'll never hit R14 if you spend that time floor-tanking in hour-long WSG pugs with a &lt;25% win-rate.
---
Good. Just... fucking **good**. Let the griefers and honor farmers and flight-pont campers stay in their fucking quarantines. They make everything worse just by existing.
---
The vocal player-base doesn‚Äôt know what they want. 
---
They cry and whine about wanting harder content, then get hard content they can‚Äôt clear, and whine
---
We just recently got both bindings as well. I don't remember them being this easy to get before, though this is purely anecdotally speaking.
---
i was reported in my first match a minute before the game started. then i got a buff saying "pls participate in this match during the next x seconds or else you wont get honor". wtf there is no way i will see an enemy by that time
---
I‚Äôm not sure what causes the pull but I‚Äôve found rotgrip won‚Äôt pull a Hydra if I can hit him as he‚Äôs facing the tunnel he leaves out of when he‚Äôs close to it. 
---
I‚Äôm a hunter so I FD if it does pull and this has been the most consistent clean pull for me. Hope it helps. Fuck that hydra though.
---
Broken game
---
&gt;But that's still an awful strategy, as it curbs honor per hour 
---
What is this? Old school runescape?
---
Yeah well then it becomes a 40 minute game with them just farming graveyard
---
Dunno but nobody ever seems to make use of those fall reductions in retail when I give them the old Dal portal by mistake.

Hi, /u/Saturos47
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e9e1h3/raid_log_tank_reviving_meme/). 
---
Let's do the math
---
https://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/binomial.aspx
---
&gt;The mean of the distribution (Œºx) is equal to n * P .
---
&gt;The standard deviation (œÉx) is sqrt[ n * P * ( 1 - P ) ].
---
n = 10000, let's assume P = 0.03
---
standard deviation is 17, mean is 300. 95% chance of being within two standard deviations, or 266~334, or 2.7% to 3.3%.
---
This is slightly inaccurate as you don't actually know P and should use the Z-score or whatever, but with 10k samples it's really close to a normal distribution.
---
If you use P = 0.02, then the 95% confidence interval is 1.7~2.3%.
---
My wife thinks I play a lot and I'm at 13 days.
---
I feel like Classic is run by a skeleton crew and all the decisions come out of J Allen Brack's butt.
---
Finite except the drops are randomized. You could conceivably play for an incredible amount of time and not get the item you‚Äôre after. 
---
It‚Äôs the same mechanic in that more time, generally speaking, means better items. The entire game is built on grinding.
---
Better quit your job.
---
premades are also "kicking" people when they do not rush. one reason i read was: "today reputation farm, tomorrow honor".
---
It's the people who changed, old AV isn't going to fix how people play the game now.
---
Only we are not at the end of Vanilla
---
people thought a "new" game aka classic would change their retail attitude, simply nope
---
What's the point of your comment?
---
I play a priest there are zero av items for me unless I get a weapon off nef that would have to drop 6 times minimum before I have a shot at getting it so qqqqqqq about only getting one free epic for running past 40 people 100 times.
---
Tukui has an add-on called elvui that has standard set ups for all the different types of classes like melee or caster dps or heals which is what I use and I love it. Weak auras has the ability to copy and paste a UI of somebody else to match I'm pretty sure so it's should be easy
---
Kirtonos. Since I made a human I decided to go 49 twink for this one since escape artist won't be as necessary at this bracket imo. Just gonna power level a gnome warrior to 29 right after.

---
So far not at all, but hey, if people do this and still feel good about themselves after - we'll see what Blizzard thinks of AFK reporting someone who isn't AFK.
---
Perhaps they won't do anything. Perhaps they will. We'll see.
---
Every day that goes by I hate this community just a little bit more. They keep finding new ways to show their shittiest sides.
---
So an absolute stomp you decided to slow roll?

Is this meant to be impressive?

You care too much about how other people play the game.

Please let this be sarcasm.

Don't listen to them, only play pally if you want to be a shitty swordsman lost in the Netflix that you're watching on your second monitor while auto attacking for 45 seconds straight.

Just play a night elf warrior.

Vanilla is 15 years old. Classic is 4 months old. Common mistake.
---
What did you expect, for them to leave the bug or somehow tell you it‚Äôs going to affect your addon?
---
Yeah, because they laugh at all the babies on PvP servers crying about literally everything.
---
Not for PvP, I dont want an off hand with 0 stats.
---
Yea I just noticed this.  Galv gave no rep or honor.
---
r/thanksimcured
---
This is a summation of most of the complaints.  Person wants to play the game how they want, but doesn't care if it makes it shittier for other players in the process.  People want to do what they want and when they want it and they want everyone else to just cover for them.
---
The people going into the mines and fucking with towers would then be bitching if they lose every game for 3 months because everyone else started doing the same thing.
---
Go home casual.

Not that clever to call someone butthurt when you're the one who made a thread to cry about this.

Just tired of alliance running by commanders and lieutenants.. takes 2 people and they‚Äôre 198 honor per
---
If you die the second time the res cd assures youre not honorless when you spawn...  
---
Also how many pvp hungry hordes did you see in the world today? Im sure it was the same as last week right?
---
I mis-remembered about the physical ring but that doesn't change the fact that there is only one actually good item for melee and casters and the caster one is a bigger upgrade than the ring is so qq.
---
Hell yeah brother, well said.
---
The Hindenburg is the name of a airship that crashed in a very famous crash.  His name is Hin Denburg.
---
I know in retail wow there is a color blindness setting. Haven't looked but it may be in the interface options in classic as well
---
Can I ask, serious question, in zerg AV how much honor are people getting?
---
I noticed the ones I (alliance) was in the bonus honor ranged from 990-1385 and with the 398 honor gained from the medal turn in, it was still slightly more than half the horde were earning in bonus honor (2500-2700) while losing.
---
Why are people ok with difference in honor gained? This does not seem to be optimized honor gained.
---
I blame the fact that we are mostly adults with jobs that have to min/max to be able to accomplish anything.  Can't spend 2 hours roaming around wasting time when that is all of your playtime for the night.
---
That's how it works. If you design a fighting game, you can have any number of combos but if spamming the A button makes you win every time then that is what the majority of players will use.  
---
It's bad design.
---
Player desire to do something that isn't intended or allowed doesn't really justify anything. Some players may want to fly, but if they exploit something in the game to achieve that we wouldn't go "Well maybe they should just allow flying in Classic."
---
Anyone who's been around has already beaten death the debate regarding AV queue limits. AV Premades were a contentious topic. Do we allow them but force them to only fight each other? Do we allow them but let them stomp PUGs? Do we just not allow them at all? It's a 15 year old argument, and there's no real use in thinking Blizzard will come to a new conclusion on it now.
---
then don't use it. Free yourself from the burden of running past 40 people 100 times.
---
So if I showed a video of a 19 druid shifting 10x, you would agree that they are better than warrior?
---
But if everyone is efficient than no one is.
---
*whips door open with animated facial expression*
---
Reminds me of the first time an item dropped in AV. 
---
I rolled greed... once
---
Sounds more like a second job than a game to me.
---
As a rogue player I personally enjoy warriors who min max with leather armor.
---
I fell for this ngl, took a shower and made a sandwich. It was okay.
---
I really prefer lower level pvp than then 60 premade honor grind mess. Lower level players care less about efficiency and actually fight for fun. I don't twink, but I like to make a decent character where I focus on putting together a really really good looking set of gear even if its not quite optimal. Maybe get some little enchants to make up for stat deficits. I wish more people would do it like that. Actual twinking is pretty awful.
---
Yeah, The people farming the wolves/rams for the calv charge on servers/bgs where there wasn't a lot of raiders.. really made a huge difference.
---
Blizzard lowkey removed most of the Totem commands from the API.
---
TotemDestroy (which wasn't in vanilla originally) was removed.
---
For some fucked up reason they also removed GetTotemInfo which has also broken totem timers all together.  Totem timers were a thing in vanilla so this was a strange change.
---
TotemDestroy being removed isn't all the surprising.
---
For TotemDestroy (dismissing your totems), there's no work around. Go back to moving totems by placing new ones in a new location like we were supposed to.
---
For Timers the only currently working addon is

At the cost of other peoples fun
---
Oh God you made me look at their post history.
---
That was the 2.0.x version tbh. Think they reverted it within a few months. 
---
But if they went per any sane phase schedule they‚Äôd gate it like that initially. To prevent people from walking into BT/Hyjal in week 1.
---
If they proposed otherwise, I‚Äôd be right there with you to raise a #nochanges stink though.
---
I don't, today I was destroyed at FP in eastern plague lands by undead mage who was camping there. I mean how irrational some people are... It surely wasn't about honor, nor pvp, just to screw lowbies day...
---
Because hoping for PvP isn't what some people want from a BG? Because they'd like to play the objectives and actually find consistent PvP? 
---
This wasn't even a statement of surprise, but more one of what's causing the AVs to generally skew away from what they were meant to be. Acting like people who want an AV experience true to its intent should be satisfied at all with the current meta is ignoring why they say they like it to begin with.
---
No, no, it is amazing and 100% mandatory.  If the mobs are far enough apart, you may not have to drink at all in the 40s and early 50s.  And this is from a priest that went Disc from 10-60.  I barely touched my water when leveling.  Mostly when feeling like I ought to be topped up for pvp or a tough pull.  I also stacked spirit like crazy.
---
The second talent you 100% need is the wand spec.  It will speed you up drastically and I miss being a pve spec without wand and spirit tap for grinding.
---
I wish people reported the actual AFKers. Seen too many.
---
People play games according to incentive structures, and the incentive structure for the honor system and AV are epic shit. We all know this, but #nochanges morons pushed to have the shit we knew back rather than think deeply about these systems and some simple changes that would actually make the game good.
---
That's debatable.  The large majority of the people I play with do not share your opinion.
---
No, that was never my premise. 
---
Show me the gear setup that allows you to shift 10x at level 19 and I will take the rest of your post seriously. Until you do that, I can't take anything else you say seriously because you speak in hyperbole instead of facts.
---
It's not that bad but it's just not really worth spending any gold money on this as a worri tank. The shield isn't great for raids due to mobs being fire immun / resistant and the heal is barely noticable against hard hitting mobs. The prog chance is also really low so it doesn't even make much difference for AoE tanking. There are simply better alternatives.
---
didn't say it did matter, but there is a higher risk reward factor for alliance rushers who break off and cap points along the way to get more honor than just the flat rushers. 
---
Sure everyone for that game get the same honor, but the flat rushers will consistently get slightly less than those caping a couple of extra points during the zerg.
---
It's a server size thing. Back when only a few raid groups were actively going per server/faction, all the raid leaders largely knew one another, and while you had to be kind of a raging jerk to get known and banned by all of them, it certainly was possible.
---
Now? There's pugs going to MC every day and time. Anyone can pop into a group heading there with only marginally more difficulty than going to BRD. There's no way for reputation to circulate to all those runs.
---
I like to hear a lot of opinions
---
So I was in AV where literally every horde was from the same server (Heartstriker) and they only had like 25 people for several minutes. Is there some exploit to prevent other players from joining your BG or what is this?
---
No longer works.
---
Nothing, the whisperer is an idiot.
---
Except that isn't the premise of the post.  The premise of the post isn't "There are alternative strategies to win", the premise of the post is "It's ok to go in and have fun doing what you want!"  That premise is bullshit.
---
If you don't want to play the team game and try to win, don't play the team game.

---
In game. Price is 650g.

Yep. Assuming you win them all, and don't turn in any quests, its about 42 games from Revered to Exalted at 21,000 total, and Neutral to Revered is also 21,000K rep. 84 is what I told myself would be best case scenario, but maybe closer to high 70's if you're doing additional quests
---
they don‚Äôt care man, tickets are pointless
---
well thats different then i remember
---
That was the answer I was looking for. Could have done that without the others giving stupid, unhelpful answers.
---
Invasive in what way?
---
the goblin teleport operators are called Scooty and Spork ...
---
Whether it‚Äôs harmful is beside the point entirely. Nobody is making them play that much. 
---
And I know how much time/effort it takes, I‚Äôm not really sure how that changes anything I‚Äôve stated.
---
Right? No one's holding a gun to your head to have BiS for every phase, either. Being an adult with a job is exactly why I have zero expectations except to log in and play the game every now and then, and apparently even those expectations were too high because you *have* to min max to get anything out of the game.
---
Link not working :/
---
You can if that's fun, though. You're obsessing over getting there in an optimal fashion, when there's a gradient between min/maxing and fucking around not getting anything done. 
---
It doesn't have to be one or the other unless you're trying for world first with a kid or a full time job or something, and at that point you might just have to accept WoW might not be the game for where you are in life right now. 
---
Easier said than done, I admit, but fuck if that ain't life.
---
As a level 58 with a 60% mount, am I going to be flagged AFK and booted out of AV if I try it tonight?
---
The "afk tag" thing is them just typing a /me command.
---
What is actually happening is they are reporting you for being 'away', even if you aren't. If 5 people report someone for being away, they're kicked. Instantly. No double check, no "are they even moving" check, they are instantly removed from the game. I'm not 60, and I have been using AV as a great way to level and get my rep at the same time. I have been removed from countless games because of premades from Herod, Fairbanks, and Skeram report me before the game even starts, just to get their friends in the game.
---
Similarly, they do things like what you said typing "/me has reported you for being afk! Type /afk to remove the tag or you will be removed in 30 seconds!" and so when you type /afk (or /afk remove, w.e), you leave the battleground and get 15 min deserter.
---
In the same vein, a mage will open a portal and will say something like help me summon and when clicked, you will be removed from the battle ground. 
---
Things that need to be changed:
---
1. Don't allow people to queue to a specific BG #. This is a big issue because they can easily choose the bg their premade is in if they didn't make it
---
2. Remove automation in the report system. ANYTHING that is automated is always a terrible system. I hope there is some way to go back and see everyone who reported people for being away when they were really just abusing it, and they get reprimanded for it.
---
3. Limit the number of players allowed to be in the same bg from the server. Don't let more than 5 players from any one server in the AV. This won't solve premading as they can work across server, but it will make it more difficult
---
I usually Farm AB and WSG until exalted (on nost) before reaching lv50, and AV from 51 to 60. So as soon i reach lv 60 i had, Epic bracer, Weapon, pants, Epic shoulder, and epic ring. Blue all the rest was decent due to the rare lv 58.
---
Internet Thugs has 1 raid and we've seen 4 ingots. They don't BoP so you can buy them from other guilds.
---
Try to convince ally to kill lieutenants and commanders. Guess everyone only wants to zero drek for a quick win, rep, and trash honor. 
---
I get that the rep is huge for quite a few classes - but killing lieutenants doesn't have to add time to the bg. Drek is super easy as long as people aren't stupid and dont over pull in the room. Just split a few off while the rest continue with the zerg.
---
You're kind of doing the same thing, idiot.
---
Spell batching could make it last 2 seconds basicly.

I think that's what these kids were getting at, mad that people left Skeram for Heartseeker, but I never played on Skeram lmao.

Awesome, thank you, reading other posts and it seems pretty negative atm
---
This is what I was doing last night.  I didn't quite get 13k per hour but I wasn't far off.  Important to also note that your first turnin of 3 marks of honor is worth 8800 XP.  Each subsequent turnin is worth 3300.
---
I got a little bored of it towards the end of level 52 and so I went to Ungoro.  I'm a horde player on Herod and I don't think I saw a single alliance player the entire time I was there.  Blew through a bunch of quests with easy, dinged 53 and a got good bit of the way through it.
---
While everyone is grinding AV rep I'm going to finish Ungoro tonight and then hammer out the plaguelands.  
---
50-60 is going to go a lot easier in just a few days then 45-50 did the last two weeks.
---
The entire problem with the current form of AV is that it doesn't require any of the PvE aspects of the match and instead benefits purely from the "zerg rush boss" strategy. You yourself just described the matches as "fast" implying that very little other than running to the other side and hoping you kill the boss faster occurs. If the match doesn't provide any PvP and scorns/punishes the team with players focusing on the PvE mechanics (outside of those involved with fighting a single boss) then what exactly is even left of the game? 
---
There's no reason to be condescending about "not liking how it is", all anyone wants here is for the game to be played in the way it was obviously designed to be played, not rewarding everyone for bumrushing the end boss and ignoring everything else.
---
if you get enough reports in a short timeframe it skips the debuff and goes straight to the kick, if you have enough friends in the game you can get rid of whoever you want.
---
True, that said, honor does decay

Not everyone wants to farm honor in AV. Some people even want to fight the enemy team, believe it or not.
---
Yeah, but it was only 67.5 on release...
---
This isn't part of the automated report system we have in retail now. This was only for putting the "afk" debuff on people and getting them kicked out of the BG. It doesn't take any actions against their account. It's been there since patch 1.5
---
I don't know which bg's you join but it's not 39 players rushing where i've been.  Tell me,  why do you feel the need to rush AV?
---
Had a Lifestone drop in an AV last night too.
---
No, I'm perfectly happy with you afking out if it means people won't whine about a 45min AV. Why should you get to tell people to go somewhere else?

Not ever getting to do anything because games are a max of 10 minutes long and being shouted at by people unhappy that not everyone wants to zerg ruins the experience for people, too.

---
We wouldn't get the original AV because we're in patch 1.12. This zerg thing happened in vanilla as well as soon as they nerfed it (because it took hours, sometimes days, to finish). And Blizzard won't do anything about it because changing it won't bring in more revenue and they won't lose revenue by not changing it.
---
This feature was. Patch 1.5 Jesus people.
---
And said business has recently folded.
---
I've seen a lot of people set up mage portals and asking for people to help them summon to get people out of the BG
---
This is the opposite of the AV AFK abuse I used in WotLK to power-level my alts through AV while AFK under the base.
---
My problem is with people who think that what they want = how the game was meant to be played. Or those that what they REALLY want deep down is just something to be unhappy and bitch about.  Fact is the game is playing like it did in 1.12 combined with 15 years of knowledge and experience. Might be tough to accept, but it‚Äôs true.
---
Also, read what you just said. What you mean is that people aren‚Äôt doing ALL the PvE elements. You can‚Äôt go into AV and completely ignore PvE elements, or the game would literally never end.

The low debuff limit is tricky because it's a relic of wow's birth that isn't necessary anymore,  but the game was balanced entirely around it. I mean simply increasing it from 8 to 16 is a big deal. 
---
I don't know the full extent to which items changed,  but I know pre bis looked drastically different.
---
they truly dont. fuck blizzard
---
Honestly, ask a guildie or a random mage for a few stacks of water if you log in, might be harder to do if you logout somewhere other than a city, i sometimes do this at 60 if i plan on doing stuff that is mana intensive such as moonkining.
---
You forgot to mention every fucking asshole just following BiS guides, no originality. RIP wow classic - biggest let down ever.
---
/who zul'farrak mage 60
---
You mean guild content? The power of PvP blacklisting came from locking you out of premades that held the highest honor per hour, if AV is the best way to grind rank then it doesn't matter if they up and decide to throw your name on their list from a PvP perspective other than the fact that they get free reign to abuse the kick function in 1.13 which hopefully will get enforced by either bans or removal of the feature as not inviting someone and continually harassing them are entirely separate things.
---
*loud audience applause*
---
I don't think most non-pvpers will give a shit if you break someone elses brackets assuming you never signed up for them. If you just do solo AV 24/7, bracket folks can't really do anything.
---
I hate to burst your bubble, but uh... the hammer is called Sulfuras. It's the HAND of Ragnaros.
---
Inb4 'ackchually' accusations over a joke.
---
Classic hype: "I'm so excited for everything to be meaningful, the game's about the journey, not the destination."
---
Classic reality: "Nah, fuck this journey. Wait, where did all the content go?"
---
Not like this shit.
---
I log off when I'm no having fun, as I'm wasting my free time if it becomes an unpaid second job.
---
Frankly, if anyone is stupid enough to rush themselves through it, that ain't my problem. I know what I am going to do and it'll last me more than the original TBC lifetime.
---
That's not the atrocious part. The atrocious part is the caster ring is not usable by shamans/druids. What the hell.
---
&gt; https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-classic-level-19-twink
---
That is 36 intellect with everything "of the eagle" - 540 extra mana. Now please tell me: how much mana does it cost to shift into bear form cost @ level 19?
---
Yeah it's annoying as hell. Every piece of content that is dropped is finished in a rediculous amount of time. Rethinking my subscription at the moment.
---
I think I'm gonna have to agree to disagree here.  I think i see where you're coming from but I'm not really able to articulate any better what I want from the instance from a game design point of view.
---
Having the trinket that ports you back to base makes them easy. As long as you're a high dps with sustain and no down time while clearing the mines.
---
That fucking deserter rebuff is the real kick in the nuts.  Fuck that.
---
3m on day 1 is already crazy long - I was getting reliable instant queues as alliance.
---
I never understood why it's such a big deal. Everyone acts like a little bicth when you dont use screenshot. Like who really gives a shit lol... put a tampon in and stfu
---
Thanks for your post, worked for me!
---
You can disable teammates nameplates, since you're a hunter and not a healer they dont even do anything for you
---
That way, Healthbar = Enemy, No Healthbar = Teammate

LFG premade to kick other premades.

YESSSSS

Man oh man have I been waiting for this comment! I was talking to a friend yesterday about this very thing. I miss vanilla very much and was hoping that classic would bring that community back. But these days it's only, "I'm only gonna help or do this if it gets my bis." I hate min maxing elitism.
---
I'm not saying that hoping for pvp isn't a valid hope. I guess your comment along with so many others where people are blaming the "current meta" or "min maxers" from private vanilla servers is misguided. it was always this way. 
---
Not saying you should be satisfied either. But this isn't a product of the current meta. the current meta is a product of the design, as it was 12 years ago.
---
I pugged for 12 hours yesterday and not once was I in a game with more than 2 people from my own server. And I'm not on a low or medium pop server.
---
There will be shenanigans for sure, but there will not be bracket fixing. It's impossible to stop someone from going beyond the others. The biggest thing that will go on is botting and account sharing, since you're never going to see the same people more than a handful of times/day.
---
Also, this kind of premade queuing is only possible on Alliance. Horde queue times shuffle around which one everyone gets into.
---
Roll PvE, pvp servers nowadays have so many gankers that it will be a corpsecamp past level 20
---
Better late than never. üòÇüòÇ
---
Premade chads dabbing on solo nerds 
---
Working as intended
---
All you have to do is setup a click macro program.. used to do t in vanilla to farm honor while I was at work. This would not stop afkers
---
That's irrelevant when every single horde player is doing the same thing.
---
Mage is stupid easy pve. One or two button rotation through classic. 
---
Hunter is a little harder through pve. You have to time shots to be the most effective at the end game level. 
---
Mages are the hardest class too PvP well at imo. Hunters are a little more forgiving with pets and high white damage but still not particularly easy.
---
Too late, some people already reach exalted. As soon as those no lifer will all be exalted in AV, AV will be fun again
---
Who the fuck are you to tell me, or anyone else, how to have fun?
---
You can /who scholomance and ask someone from a group if you can use their empty dungeon after they finish. People are usually pretty cool about it!
---
So now you don't even need a bot to farm av as horde. Just an Auto clicker... What a mess
---
Like this little twat
---
If he's chinese just bring up Hongkong, the uigurs or Tibet or Taiwan
---
You can turn off the names as well.  I only show player names.
---
I do play classic and i dont know.
---
Is it pvp server thing?
---
how do you send psychiatrist referrals
---
Magnitudes more players clearing content.
---
And its those same people that throw a fit every time an article is posted that suggest gamers have become entitled. They **hate** being called out for their own shit.
---
Fuck that. Needs 6 months min
---
I do what I want, and you do what I want.
---
That makes a lot of sense. I‚Äôm anti-minmaxing in WoW classic (I minmax like fuck in Diablo II and whatnot) because I want maximum fun and enjoyment out of this game. And I‚Äôm getting it. I‚Äôve never watched streamers though, and I don‚Äôt watch much on YouTube. I‚Äôve never seen esports stuff. I‚Äôm guessing one just gets into a different mentality when they get deep into that competitiveness.
---
Back in vanilla I believe we had 7 Garr bindings with 1 Geddon binding.
---
I dont even remember what the original comment read, but I assume the now deleted comment was some guy fuming (similar to how you are right now lol). Anyways my guy, good luck out there. Reddit/hating a streamer means too much to you friend.
---
And Fanart. Can't forget how every subreddit for games, shows ect all turn into fanart
---
You only see what you can buy.
---
Funny thing is I‚Äôm after the rep not the honor.   Furthermore the 398 honor I get from 3 mark turn in is just the cherry on top.    All this in under 10min.    Waste of time, you make me laugh.   Thank you I love to laugh.   Rep does not decay but your rank/honor will,  so  IMO you wasted your time if that bar goes left or if the majority of your server are better pvpers then you.
---
Only item that‚Äôs later is the spell pen ring which is p5. Rest is available now
---
I dont remember getting honor for npcs in private servers, everyone was farming wsg with premades for honor, doing av only for rep rewards
---
Agree 100% - if you're not having fun, it's nobody else's fault.
---
They never complained this much.  We all marched on and got through it to 60
---
I've been thinking a lot about this exactly; If you had the same enthusiasm and determination to improve your real self, in the same way you do with your WoW char, you could achieve some great things.
---
This is why I completely stopped WoW all together.
---
If you want to improve how many mobs you can kill before needing to drink, just need to do these 3  simple ateps, even at level 35.
---
Wear a shield.
---
Use only lightning bolt. Unless on clear cast them do whatever.
---
Stack SP and have 5/5 convection.
---
Being an elemental shaman ta 38 is a lot easier because at that point you have a new rank of lightning bolt and 4/5 lightning mastery. With over 100 so at 39 or higher you should be able to kill 4 to 5 mobs in a row very quickly before drinking more water.
---
Once you hit 40 and get elemental mastery, tag 3 mobs at once and then spell batch crit CL with a shock. Drop fire nova totem and you just killed 3 mobs basically for free Evey 3 minutes to greatly speed up grind times.
---
Or save it and delete a gnome your level in PvP. Either way, really.
---
Getting in the top bracket requires ~333 people on the server/faction who have 15 HKs, and you need that several weeks in a row to get r14. Firelash may well not have the population to support an Alliance r14.
---
you copy and paste mate
---
Alliance is getting a win turnin every single match.
---
It was an addon using classic's api that incorporated , from what I understand,  mostly combat log data into one UI frame that kept track of alerted you to the presence of nearby players.  This was not only a strong hit to rogues, druids, and night elves,  but ALSO meant a player didn't need to utilize audio cues, or pan the camera for visual cues.
---
That is awesome, I did not know that. Thanks
---
Me i am level 48 and i expect to stay in my bracket for a while. Keep in mind, when u arrive 60, you will face people with their pvp gear or their raiding gear. Its way easier to bg and max the gear in your bracket
---
Pretty neat add on. Just walk up to my bank and it auto fulls my bags with the raid nights consumes.    
---
Though it is annoying as it doesnt detect how many you have on you so it does it every time i open my bank... havent used it in a while for that reason.
---
I remember you used thesr to buy gear back in the day, when is that coming out?
---
I have fun being successful and getting geared, its not a "job" to me, a job is what retail turned into where you have to do daily's every day and farm artifact power (or whatever it is now).  I want to play the game and do things that need done, but I want to do it in the most efficient way possible to reach my goals (again, having fun to me is being geared and successful in raids and PVP, whatever that takes is what i will work on \*effectively as possible\*).
---
Is anyone having mob leashing problems since the patch? I logged on to AoE level at 42 in Tanaris and the Wastewater mobs reset on me mid combat. Seems to happen more readily if I freeze them. Can be standing on their spawn spot also, makes no difference.
---
I logged and did the normal, nothing changed. Didn't test other places yet.
---
I wish they would just make it like how it is in raid groups, it would be so much clearer. It‚Äôs almost like they deliberately chose the shade of green closest to red
---
Legit. Seconded.
---
Sure, just like people corpsecamping is just 'having fun'
---
Elemental is way the hell faster after 40, its not even close. That is also including the extra drink time after chain pulling 5 mobs.
---
No there is no exploit. The only way is if the other 15 people didn't accept their queue. It then takes two minutes for them to get their invitation removed and others to get queued in to that AV
---
I don't even know why anyone would bother with that bracket in the first place. You don't get any of your decent abilities and gear until you're in your early 30s for most classes. Why waste your time with it?
---
Age checks out.
---
Im guessing &lt;lost chapter&gt;. They‚Äôre confirmed win trading before bgs
---
Good question, yes Emberstrife has been slain and I myself have been slain many times. He finds people after they take a port, normally close to the inn or the mystic ward.
---
Thank you! Just focus on having fun and don‚Äôt RAGE at the awesome men and women who make this game possible. They aren‚Äôt making the community do any of this, the PEOPLE in the game or BG are ruining your experience, not the developers.
---
No one cares when you die in the stunlock :/^)
---
as I said before it's not the nameplates I have an issue with, it's the names. 
---
It's easier to use names instead of models to see allies/enemies in the world. Nameplates only render at 20 yds anyway so they are not very useful for this purpose.
---
Thank you for your detailed explanation. Not only did you answer my question but you helped me become a better DPS in cat form. I am new to the power shifting and trying to learn the rotation, which I feel I have a better grasp on after your explanation. I Don't expect to go Kitty to much in pvp. 
---
So I mostly tank and heal. Trying to get better at DPSing. 
---
And when I said trouble holding ahead - I meant holding aggro?
---
I only show player names as well, I assume you mean you only show enemy player names?
---
Not the warriors fault we have hardly any drops.
---
Make a /target npcname macro, then bind a key to interact with character. Done!
---
What are we supposed to do with this information? Lol
---
Clearly you're not a 90's kid or you're know the original members of TLC were Lisa "left eye" lopez, T-Boz Watkins and Burt Reynolds.
---
It depends on the server you play on. If you have a lot of people that are ranking on your servers it's going to be very hard. If you're on a small server, or you have a very small faction on said server it can be a lot easier. It is however going to be a lot of playing for a lot of weeks.

Epic battles. That's what we use to call them before the min/maxers called it Turtle.

---
start joining premades my man
---
You are not broke, but looking at your comments in this thread you are clearly on the verge of retardation.
---
costs about 100 mana
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGswvQzBbAo
---
watch parts of that video. The druids at 19 swap forms like no tomorrow and it only costs mana to go into bear form not to exit and both entering and exiting remove snares
---
Let‚Äôs not forget they released bg‚Äôs which apparently people were allowed to trade ingots cross server in and bug that set the tone for the rush style gameplay we see now. Which is forcing us to play more pve in order to get honor for pvp gear.
---
Gotcha. It alerts you of players and stealthies around you from the enemy faction. a lot of controversy about the addon. Was needed to only alert you of players within 50 yards now.
---
WSG is just way more fun. It's the first "real PvP" I've experienced in Classic so far. Like not just being in/running from gank squads.
---
But you literally can just do that. I‚Äôve been playing since day one and I‚Äôm level 30. I‚Äôve had a blast.
---
You good fam
---
The only part that needs a group - should be the Dire Maul West.
---
I meant turn off NPC names.
---
Whatever you say, ghost of Burt Reynolds.
---
You don't need to go over 308, it's the perfect spot.
---
They are like 50g on the AH right now on my server, not exactly a steep entry requirement.
---
The issue I can see off top is that you're fighting an easy boss and a substantially more demanding boss right after (not hard per se, but Vael was a gear check back in the day and while 1.12 helps it doesnt auto clear him) meaning people will be hesitant to join a questionable pug because if they kill Razorgore and the group runs up against a wall at Vael they are already saved.
---
Pretty much the mentality and the rest of them.
---
I have very few memories of AV zergs back from vanilla, not necessarily saying you're wrong, just saying I have no personal experience to indicate it was THIS ubiquitous. And there seem to be plenty that agree. 
---
Moreover, sure, the flawed design pushes the most efficient path to zerging, but don't try to tell me that the group spearheading the quest for "efficiency in AV" isn't the min-maxers. 
---
Blizzard isn't telling anyone how they have to play, and the objectives are still there for the taking. Saying it's Blizzard's fault is a lazy way of avoiding admitting that there are enough players out there looking to spoil the nature of what AV is supposed to be that it's happening. It's partially Blizzard's fault for not aligning the values of the BG to the most "efficient" way to win it, but it's also a grayer area than that, imo.
---
but i want the ring? Just like the melee want their ring.
---
Meta sluts
---
I mean, Asmon could retire today. The guy is loaded.
---
You continually get XP.
---
I'm level 52 and did a bunch of AV last night.  I got 8800 xp for my first turnin of 3 AV marks of honor.  I have gotten 3300 xp for every subsequent turn in of 3 AV marks of honor.
---
It isn't necessarily that you can level up by not leaving a capital city.  AV is a big zone with mobs, quests, and PVP.  So you are going out of the city in the same manner as if you went to any contested zone.  Sure, you can sit in the tunnel and get the marks for xp but even at 5 minute long games you won't make nearly as much xp as going to other zones.  It's not ideal but it is viable.  After that first turnin that got me 8800 xp I was making around 12-13k xp an hour playing in AV.
---
&gt; Probably can def get rank 9 for the full blue set though.
---
You need 10 for the helm and shoulders.
---
Hahahahahaha yes
---
This happened to me on EU again. A bunch of players from Sulfuron server (Alliance) joined and one by one a bunch of players got reported afk as soon as the BG gates opened. I saw people running next to me to Drek fading into nothing as they got kicked for 'afk'. I saw a guy fighting the battlemasters before drek get booted. They did all the tricks ('x has reported you afk...', 'click summon' on SW portal etc) too. All to make room for 5-10 more of them to get in. 
---
Took a ton of screenshots because I was going to hit the fucking roof and report them if they did it to me, but I'm not really interested in naming/shaming or starting a flame war. Just confirming that premade groups are ABSOLUTELY exploiting the autoreport function to unfairly remove legitimate players (already actively participating in the BG) in favour of more of their group joining.
---
It does help the match.
---
Id blame his viewers for watching him watchin videos while afk in AV, but the original quote seems sarcastic to me. Feels like hes poking fun at Blizzard for the state of the game.
---
Oh I thought that was the battle standard. Disregard you can prolly get rank 10 then.
---
Ctrl +C and Ctrl V My dude.
---
Yessir, and it‚Äôs such a joke to be this hyper-elite about trivial content. My guild doesn‚Äôt require flasks, plays super sloppy, yet we waltz through MC in sub two hours. 
---
My biggest issue isn‚Äôt in the PvE side, because individual guilds can set their own pace and culture. I‚Äôm very put-off by the PvP and how clunky this game is for such fast paced action that all the min-max 300 engineering honor farmers are bringing to the table.
---
Rule 3 bro
---
Hunters can not track stealth
---
The whole min/max, spellcleave, meleecleave and other shit like that honestly killed all my will to play classic. I even had an inkling that AV would turn into this shitfest where people just zerg for max honor gains. So happy that I didn't give into and sub again for BGs.
---
I don't know the answer to your question, but my guild has had 5 TOEP without either binding and that just absolutely blows my mind.
---
evening shift operator reporting in
---
Welcome to Twinkville.
---
People act like epic battles, I mean, "turtling" is a bad thing for a PvP server.  Fuck off min /maxers with your bullshit.
---
Could also be service industry, winter attire or gear, heat or insulation installation...I'll take the Field over Accounting
---
How is it at the cost of other peoples fun when the current meta for Horde is to just let the Alliance win?
---
I dont think you understood my message, I can see why tbh
---
Why do you think the undead look and smell the way they do? They aint ded, they just always high on meth. üòÇ
---
Theres a goblin named Tran‚Äôrek in the northern corner of Gadgetzan too
---
....welp I have won 100% of my AV matches as ally so far. 10+ matches. Idk about this 75% thing.
---
I mean that's not true at all
---
Late work wow gang.
---
It depends a lot on your team, if you have big premade they probably target lower levels and afks early on and sometimes those who spam different tactics than they. There's still so many random BGs going on at once that if you don't get too big premades people don't really care as long as enough people move towards objectives at start.
---
&gt;They implemented a lockout time now. 
---
Are you sure about this? I think Soda changed his name recently using this method.
---
did it all day yesterday with the dmb timer works 90% of the time.
---
&gt; This is how AV is supposed to be. All you people are forgetting how lame those long battles were and how lame they were
---
So much more honor and more interesting and engaging than doing nothing but PvE for PvP rewards.
---
&gt;I love how people always say write a ticket like the GM's give af. It's amusing.
---
A guild mate has a level 39 alt stuck in Nirvana, can't log him in. Has been writing tickets for three weeks, no help thus far.
---
Basically how it works is that they  queue at teh same time, then the people that manage to get in the same BG reports the other people for AFK so they get kicked, then the remaining raid members join their AV number, since free slots opened up.
---
I mean it‚Äôs pretty useless to do anyway. Matches take like 8 min and all have the same result. They don‚Äôt really gain anything from doing this.
---
People are ok with it because alliance ranks against other alliance, who have similar amounts of honor. Whenever alliance tries to honor farm they end up being less efficient as they get turtled on alliance base turning the fight into 30+ minutes and lose with even less honor gained. Horde pvp advantage is that big.
---
Some folks in here have already answered your specific question, but alternatively you could go to the AV instance portal in Alterac Mountains. That's what I have been doing. You don't even have to click any NPC; just run through the red portal and it brings up the battleground window.
---
I really didn't, what are you talking about?
---
Still 67.5 years is too soon?
---
How did you finish the one where you cap the mine? I killed the named grog but received no credit.
---
I‚Äôd say this kinda behavior isn‚Äôt isolated to just that instance, so probably best to stay clear from the dude and his guild.
---
IKR!
---
How many times have you turned in 3 marks?
---
Parting of the sensory - Modest mouse
---
That's fair enough. The tension everyone's feeling is that there's damn  no way people that don't care about how fast you get geared can't get away from that mentality unless they're in a dungeon group, and it goes both ways because I'm sure all you guys looking for efficiency feel the same way about people that are happy brewing up a turtle. There's no solution, and there's not much coming together on this unless someone just rolls over and says, "Fine, I'll play AV your way."
---
Yep, 5 as the title itself says here, what's your point?
---
Boo hoo
---
We had a shaman ot in our guild in vanilla. He managed to make it up to zg before he got edged out.
---
Yeah that one was a little weird, it took me a couple of tries. Might be a little buggy
---
Lol what does it matter. So long as you enjoy playing the flavor of wow you prefer who cares how populated or desolate it is?
---
So we all agree then, the ring should be in the game
---
Blizzard doesn't really employ a lot of GMs anymore but uses automated systems for cost cutting (leading to worse performance than priv servers).
---
We were already in their base, 6 minutes in, and they were still getting people joining (all Heartstriker).
---
Lol how are those true strike shoulders treating you in PvP?
---
No one gives a rats ass that you did 2% more damage than the second place dps.
---
They don't do shit.
---
There's an obvious account sharer / botter that farms Rich Thorium Veins in The Noxious Glade on my server. He is quite literally there 24/7.
---
I have reported him multiple times. He is still allowed to keep up his bullshit. They will do absolutely nothing.
---
Most of us watching this ridiculousness unfold are sitting here peacefully grinding away on our PVE servers.
---
Blizzard could integrate re-captcha with a 1.5m countdown. Not a serious suggestion cause super-doubt but it would prevent afk‚Äôing/botting
---
&gt;Maybe there are 10 battlegroup?
---
Try removing the 0. Every server is linked.
---
Yeah sword mastery is better than mace.
---
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
---
You get that BiS you dirty, dirty girl.
---
Don't forget the more blatant reference:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15520/oreily](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15520/oreily)
---
My GF and I started playing classic on launch having never played the original. 
---
We just hit level 20 and are having a blast. Last night we completed some quests with a random person we met online. He joined our party, taught us how to use the chat, and was super encouraging.
---
Isn‚Äôt this what it‚Äôs about?
---
Lmao that is so good
---
For raiding, the questionable part is putting points into retribution past improved blessing of might.
---
What addon do you use to track enemy interrupts?
---
Happened to me in a &lt;GRIZZLY&gt; premade
---
With what phase do they release?
---
u/Mage_Girl_91_ is a dude? Sounds about right.
---
Game will be dead in less than 6 months.  Thanks for the early fun.  It went to shit quick.
---
hilarious and ironic that you mock others for "taking pixel fights more serious than life' because they teabagged you, and yet don't have the self-awareness to realize that whining about getting teabagged is taking the fight more seriously than the guy teabagging you.   
---
If you can't take bants then don't play online games
---
Yes, but the dreaded "automated report system" that folks are typically putting down is the move from manual GM reviews for reporting actions that could get a player suspended. This feature was never manual, it would be kinda crazy if it was. You'd need GM's to be posted 24/7, checking each report, and watching a guy long enough to see if he's really participating, then kick him out of a single BG (which he can rejoin in 15 minutes).
---
To be honest there are a few indications that
---
Blizzards main goal here is to get people to play retail in the long run.
---
Whats the range on the "something stealthed near you" sound?
---
Well it's not in the game so qq
---
look at the videos, they have about 1380 mana (without mana buffs like AI). that's 13.8 shifts if we go with 100 mana cost (which is very reasonable - LOOK at the mana before and after shifting during the video). for 13.8 shifts that's 13.8*2 = 27.6 snare removals. and that's not accounting for regen or mana pots or buffs that increase mana.
---
Between the cut throat politics, the 3am pings, the spreadsheets, the constant surveys to fill out and the "yeah, so we went through the logs and it would be great if you could come on Saturday to farm Hand of Justice" conversations with your raid coordinator it's actually worse than my first job. 
---
The worst part of it is that I'm not even part of a guild good enough to warrant half of that.
---
Hydramist OP
---
I‚Äôm an orc.

Ree I'm special I like to pvp in a BG where a majority of the people just want honor.

That's literally what we have right now.

I‚Äôd you queue in alterac mountains just run into the portal and when you leave a battle you will auto interact and you can hit join battle
---
Happened to me too, I actaullly joined an account that had just started like 30 secs ago and as soon as I got in I got reported afk prob for still being at the start
---
I'm on horde so I know it's not my guild lol. But I'm sure there's more than one doing it
---
&gt; they're both the same shape

yes, I'll give you that

Yup

&gt; he only difference is one is more dark in the center and one shows a blurry city in the center.
---
So other than being an entirely different colour, making an entirely different sound and having an entirely different glow effect colour, and an entirely different bit in the center that doesn't look similar at all....
---
Obviously it would be way more than 5 people required to kick you.
---
just a quick WC, no biggie.
---
don‚Äôt forget esretard for banning players who kill him while he stuffs his face full of egg burgers while giving himself all the loot
---
By now I'm fairly convinced most of reddit doesn't even play the game, they're just pretending. Or they're amazingly bad at understanding the game.
---
Ahh that makes more sense. I thought you'd been on there since September and not seen a drop.
---
Why would you win trade a bg when you can win it in 2 seconds
---
Yea that's pretty good
---
When someone says that "X is living rent free in Y's head" they're saying that X is so obsessed with Y that they don't care/realize that Y benefits from their obsession.
---
You‚Äôre giving him your most valuable asset for nothing at all: space in your mind.
---
You say that as if there weren't adults with the same responsibilities playing 15 years ago
---
And then blame someone else for their lack of enjoyment.
---
We're already on our way to LFR and sharding, fam.
---
Servers have more population than they did back then.
---
*We're doomed!*
---
And if you TRY to win the zerg it only works sometimes, which ends up being massive losses of honor and rep. This tactic works way too well. It's not quite a win, but its consistent across every single match
---
8800 xp for the 1st time. 3300 xp for every turn in after that.
---
Its more of your luck than anything.
---
The first two are the most important ones. Having premades in AV isn't exactly the problem, its them abusing the reporting system, as well as the ability to queue for a specific AV that encourages abusing the system. I do agree with you though
---
I also just noticed the UC horde npc Elena rusk lol
---
You need to step away from the computer for a min bro.  Jesus.
---
I'd just reply with a curt and lowercase "kys"
---
&gt;Giving bosses more health won't make it harder, it will just make it take longer.
---
Which will make it harder? Longer fights mean the bosses actually have mechanics. Right now the submerge phase in the ragnaros fight doesn't exist for any competent guild because they simply have too much DPS. Shazzrah can sometimes be killed before he even teleports.
---
Not even close, I barely play in the week and prolly play about 10 hours at the weekend.  But I do level much faster than 7 days to 60.
---
Many mechanics in MC are ignored because the damage they cause is trivial or the boss doesn't even live long enough for an ability to be used. Increasing the damage and health in intelligent ways will result in less of a brainless tank'n'spank in those cases. Or you can increase the frequency of when abilities are used.
---
Yes, harder content takes more time than easier content. Blizzard could change the damage of everything in MC to 1 and it would just "shave time off your weekly clear" but many people would quit the game over such a change. Reducing the impact of changes to "it would take X more time when on farm so don't do anything" is a very myopic way of looking at raid balance.
---
Yea its really stupid
---
Were you quoting the call of duty 4 opening cinematic?
---
We did not want late vanilla though. We wanted mid vanilla, like 2005 vanilla.
---
Then why even mention a rogue? He was talking about warrior wearing leather in a PvP context why else would he care as a rogue lol
---
You haven't played for 15 years if you never noticed. I refuse to believe it.
---
You got in with the hype in August and you just noticed now after 6 months.
---
Someone‚Äôs an over reactionary snowflake, but not who you think....
---
Never forget that the internet has a strong negative bias.  It's simply because people are more likely to complain than praise something, so the negative comments are amplified.  
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias
---
Because the thing you want is still preserved if it takes 8 hours of play a day instead of 12. The amount of people that can play 12 hours a day and the amount of people who can play 8 are almost exactly the same. However, when it takes 8 hours instead of 12 you don't have to literally ruin you life to do it.
---
Ehh, I think there's been this trend in gaming in general. You saw it years ago with AP farming. If you weren't farming your ass off every day you were just behind. At the end of the day, me farming AP literally means nothing but we all still go as hard as possible. It's the same thing with honor now. It's the never ending hamster wheel that is now gaming.
---
People just don‚Äôt wanna forego small amount of rep for more fun, which is sad. And, horde still can‚Äôt realize that they can‚Äôt win the Zerg race against alliance in AV, and eventually alliance will get epic AV rewards way faster. Something has to change with AV for sure imho
---
Everyone literally had macros on keybind saying something along the lines of "Straight to &lt;Opposing faction general&gt;!!" 
---
Blizz isn't telling anyone how to play, and you're 100% free to try and cause a turtle or just pvp for 10 min. by intercepting the tail of the zerg.     
---
And you're 100% right that it's the min maxers driving how this game is played... all of this game... just like it was in vanilla.    casual players struggled with the nature of vanilla wow, which is why everything got simplified, balanced, and eventually became the characterless retail that everyone was bitching about. 
---
vanilla is a fucking grind designed for min maxers. Which is why I'm behind most of my guild. I'm not in my 20's like during vanilla. I can't play 6 hours every day. So I was 'late' to 60 and only have a few pieces of end game gear.   I'm okay with that because I knew what I was signing up for having been so invested in vanilla wow the first time.  
---
Ya'll wanted classic but either forgot the very nature of it or simply didn't play enough or were too young or something to realize that.
---
Ahh, but they can. There are limitations to it however
---
Used to sit up all night playing WoW back in the day listening to Art Bell on the radio.   Good times
---
moonglow resto is only 5 talent points shy of being the optimal druid farming spec (30/0/21 moonfury). you're missing out on +10% damage with starfire, moonfire and wrath, which is important for speeding up DM:E and Maraudon solo runs. but in terms of open world farming non-elite mobs, your spec really doesn't matter all that much. what's more important is having 2 strong sets of gear to farm with: your primary balance / resto set with lots of sp, spell crit, mp5, and secondary set with lots of agility and spirit. this way, you can keep downtime to a minimum, drink less and just kill stuff in cat while you wait for your mana to regen:    
---
moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, barkskin, hurricane, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, and maybe bear to finish them off. innervate, drink a little, repeat the hurricane rotation. now you're completely oom and it's time to switch into your agi / spirit set, kill single targets in cat form, wait for your mana to replenish and wait for your innervate cooldown to end.
---
Good ole COD4 quote lol
---
Yeah it's just not interesting to play because the progression feels meaningless in retail.
---
Interesting, I wonder if while in a BG you can message anyone even if they aren‚Äôt in a BG or your server.
---
You know it buddy! I got a pretty high rank myself and I'm am terrible. Like, I get in fights and just slap my open palm on the keyboard and hope for the best. That's what it takes to become Warlord!
---
I'm not sure what route you are using, but I typically aggro Rotgrip using curse of doom from the "bridge" he swims under (jumping down from princess area) and then run to the ledge above where tinker is. By the time he gets to the area where tinker was, the curse has gone off so I reapply from that ledge. 
---
Then I run up to the top of that 3-ledged area (with him behind) and jump down once he gets to the top (DoT-ing all the way), back down to tinker area. By the time Rotgrip is back down he is almost dead and i can bolt him down. Regarding the hydra, it only pulls for this route maybe 1 out of 3 times. When it does, I just fear it a couple times when it gets in range and finish it off after rotgrip. 
---
I'm sure there are better routes but this is viable with DS/Ruin so saves me some respecs.
---
As long as you stay subscribed blizzard couldn‚Äôt give a shit about issues caused by people being shitty. It‚Äôs why we have dead servers etc. It‚Äôs because people are assholes and given the chance to be an online hero etc they are going to act like this. Not saying blizz couldn‚Äôt do more to help but it is really a community problem.
---
Duuuude, same here, night shift today. Sucks ass
---
This AV was the literal last 3 months of Vanilla. Compared to the year it was out already.
---
Can you not read?
---
&gt; As a rogue player I personally enjoy warriors who min max with leather armor.
---
He doesn‚Äôt say anything about PVP just min maxing.
---
I am in no way supporting or condoning the current method people are using to enable premades.
---
I was simply pointing out it's the symptom of a problem.
---
The problem could be resolved by allowing Premades.
---
The system could be setup so people that queue as a group, only get queued against other people whom queued as a group.   This eliminates scouting and dodging other premades in favour of a premade wiping the floor with a pug. 
---
Will it kill them to do this?  No!
---
Will they do it?  Also no
---
Why?  Because it takes time and resources to implement, and they've already made it clear they want a skeleton crew developing classic and it's unsupported by CS staff to boot, to also save on resources that would be needed to employ more CS staff to cover it.
---
&gt; On "the people's server" at that. Although what Herod actually is is a collection of bitter no-life NA private server players jealous of anyone who has successes in their life outside of playing wow all day. Hence the sociopathy and doing things like this.
---
Herod is one of the largest US servers. Do you think there are enough "bitter no-life NA private server players jealous of anyone who has successes in their life outside of playing wow all day" to make that so?
---
Or are you generalizing an enormous population and using your own life as a reference for where they are in theirs?
---
This
---
Ehhh could be worse. Day off tomorrow got wow to look forward to.
---
Yea, the rush to the finish crowd really sucks the fun out of the game. The latest example is obviously AV, people openly berate people who don't want to zerg to the end and are even going as far as to report people, that are only trying to play the BG as intended, as AFK to get them kicked out.  The community in this game really took a turn for the worse, and it's a shame because I think it will ultimately wind up ruining the game.
---
Hit me with your Hand of Justice daddy
---
Loser
---
&gt; oooo i can click on the stonehearth GY banner im gonna do it!"
---
i do this on purpose because i hate this stupid fucking pve meta.
---
I will do whatever it takes to make sure that Pvping happens in a PvP server in a PvP/Pve BG. I will be that guy who PvPs to piss off the minority of min/maxers in BGs. While I PvP, I'm having good fun in a MMORPG, though pissing off the min/maxers in a PvP setting is a bonus.
---
Different story for AU - We only have 4 servers.
---
Article 14: Don't roll alliance
---
If you're an alliance player you deserve a ban xD
---
I don't even know what rank 14 means, I'm just a lvl 43 warlock who wants to take it easy and have fun
---
Thank you for saying that. I follow this sub because we play, but most of the things I don‚Äôt understand. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what AV, BG, or any of those other acronyms mean. 
---
We are just trying to have fun. And have met some great people along the way.
---
For the past couple years I've been like IN my bed by 10 pm and on weekends just completely wiped out tired by 11pm or 12 am on special occasions..  
---
I've definitely pulled some 2-3 am Friday nights on Classic lol.  
---
Time just melts away in that game.
---
Do people even seriously follow esports? Why would you spend time watching another dude playing a game that you could be playing yourself?
---
Hours ? More like days
---
With the sheer amount of content in the game I can't blame them either. It gives a nice touch to the world
---
I mean people used to do this with AV premades all the time. but in a different way that wasn't an exploit. The classic thing to do was type: '/e You have been reported AFK. Type (/afk quit) to clear your Away status or you will be removed from the battleground.' Then a bunch of people would drop and your premade could fill. This is shitty but not new, and they just found a new exploit with the afk system to do it. If you fell for the /e method once you never fell for it again, but this new method sounds like a straight up exploit considering how far the action is on AV and how difficult it is to clear an AFK flag in time. Hope the people doing it get reported enough to have some action taken against them - tricking people is one thing, exploiting a feature is another.
---
It‚Äôs only a good metric to look at for total active players if a similar percentage of horde/alliance players raid. 
---
It‚Äôs a good indicator of how many players are raiding and logging, but if you want to ask the questions that the census addon looks to answer, it‚Äôs a very poor substitute.
---
This is true. A lot of people spout the mantra 'well you just have to play 18h/day for 3 weeks' to get rank 14 - but it completely ignores these factors. A brainless bot queueing for BGs 24h a day won't come close in honour to what a high-skill, optimised, high-communication and well resourced premade would get in 12h. That is until 7 min AV rushes.
---
I'm really hoping someone has a fix for Raven, spent a lot of time setting up the buffs how I like 'em.  Someone posted some main.lua fixes on curseforge but they aren't working for me in getting the buff icons to reappear.
---
&gt; You aren't going to get rank 14,
---
what kind of dumb argument is that? R10 is not hard to get and gives insane rewards for both pve and pvp
---
And that white hit is critting around 300 dmg
---
WTF are you talking about man
---
[You main a druid but you clearly never played one at 19 in classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrHo2ItFlM)
---
You can't get flagged afk before the doors open. You probably got baited by someone using /emote.
---
Well the boat from Menathil to Wetlands... so that added a slight flight time, and the boat left as soon as I landed... so there is more time
---
Being "savage" and "cruel" is probably a personality defect though.
---
It may just be that people enjoy playing a villain role they can't/don't play in real life, but that hinges on some sort of mental defect still. 
---
Then again, anyone playing Classic WoW probably has some sort of defect one way or another. Or we just all do, as a collective human race.
---
At the start of AV it‚Äôs important to not that alliance was whining far more about horse‚Äôs unfair start halfway up the map.
---
its not debatable at all. its objectively true.
---
Lol this! I saw one time some dude on the other side and thought he was a hacker. Then one day much later I accidentally ran a bit too far and ended up in the middle. My jaw literally dropped in realization that it was only my mind and my presumptions holding me back
---
Mage is your best bet for gold/hour.
---
It was a full time job back in the day, and that was back when battlegrounds only opened during standard hours. Now BG's are 24 hours a day because of battlegroups, making it even tougher.
---
I rolled a mage not to zerg to 60 but to play the class I played in vanilla. 90% of the time getting an SM or ZF group while leveling, I had to avoid other mages like the plague because I didn't want to spam the dungeons. I wanted to run the dungeons I ran back in the day. It's gotten so annoying. In some ways people are the same and nice and there's community again, and it other ways they only care about efficiency.
---
trying to do this on my warrior right now testing with engi healing helm. cant seem to get it to work? ive been unequipping all my my gear then reequipping so im at half hp then i equip my healing helm and weapon and enter combat, seems to still be 20hp5. does this only work with paladins?
---
Yea, only a small few will get rank 14. People need to just live in gaming mediocrity and be ok with it. Too much complaining.
---
Its becoming a huge turn off. Everything has become SO competitive.
---
no, thats simply not true. you are just showing you didnt play vanilla and just emulate what you've read.
---
yikes
---
You've been blinded by nostalgia if you think that people weren't min-maxing back the day. 
---
In my experience the game was a lot more cliquish back then though, with people being less willing to pug (because pre 1.12 the content was harders). So if you weren't in that kind of group you may not have seen as many people advertising it. Plus the vocabulary has changed. "LFM dps UBRS, no melee" back in the day is effectively the same as "LFM DPS UBRS, Rend's swords reserved" in Classic. There have always been people who would spend extra time trying to stack a group to improve their odds at loot. Trying to paint that as a modern problem with the community and not acknowledging that it has always been a thing is just revisionist.
---
It's so strange to me seeing everyone playing the meta so hard. I've been playing since classic launch, have a few pieces of raid gear but mostly blues. Still working on my epic mount and plugging away at honor. I am absolutely loving my time in wow playing at my own pace and cant relate to a lot of the people complaining. Not to disregard their opinions, I guess i'm just living in my own WoW.
---
If you play Horde on any other realm you deserve to be bullied imo
---
Goodnight Stanley, love you!
---
I've been playing this game since launch. Sorry I don't find it fun to waste hours in AV.
---
Holy shit yes, thank you. I fucking hate AV, it's boring and a waste of time. I just want to get done with it and go do fun Battlegrounds like WSG and AB. 
---
It's not my fault that the battleground sucks, or that it gives the most honor, it's Blizzard's awful design with honor, but i'm not gonna try to have fun with the system if it's inherently shit.
---
There will never be any skill in scripted pve sequences.  There is only ones ability to communicate with your raid and execute the counters to said scripted sequence.
---
Now if raid bosses had a 25 long list of abilities they could randomly select from during any given ‚Äúpull‚Äù and the player would have no ability to know what the boss will pull out of his hat then you could say that requires ‚Äúskill‚Äù.
---
PvP at a high level requires skill and I will agree with that to a certain extent because even then the same classes have the same builds and use the same spells and abilities in essentially the same order making the only thing not scripted about pvp is the player movement.
---
Premades for AV is ultimate spergery
---
Sad. But I think you're right from other experiences I've seen.
---
The forums were just as entertaining back then as they are today.
---
Back in my day! That's what you sound like.
---
Rep or honor?
---
Some servers wouldn't be able to do bgs without it though
---
Level 47 Tauren Warrior. Where should I level and where‚Äôs my next area and at what level?
---
They were heroes, they were going after onyxia .....
---
Thanks, that clears it up &lt;3
---
Thanks that clears it up &lt;3
---
man i forgot how god tier The Unstoppable Force is for how easy it was to get. like the only clear huge upgrades are high warlord weapons or rag weapons.
---
Hey, if it's fun for you just keep doing it. 
---
According to this page - https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/silverwing-sentinels-warsong-gulch-reputation - there are some level 48 rewards as well as level 50 bracers.   The level 60 purple items are very good as well. 
---
Someone else was saying last night that if you earn too many medals (you can only hold 20), that the extras get mailed to you?  Is that accurate?  I have no idea. 
---
Anyway, if you're having fun you can keep running the level 49 bracket till you're exalted with your WSG faction.  You'll snag a couple decent items, then you can turn in all your medals and continue moving to 60.    The level 58 blues are decent, though there aren't many of them, and the level 60 purples are very good for some if not all classes. 
---
Also, as a fresh 60 you may find WSG to be very challenging, so if you place a high value on the exalted items, consider which will take more time -- WSG in the 49 bracket or in the 60 bracket.
---
Clearly you havent twinked 19 druid, or have gone against/with (a good) twink druid in 19s before. Druids are not (nearly)universally known to be best FC in 19s for their health, their armor, their damage, their heals, their CC, or their immunity to so much CC, but for the fact that they are the best mix between all of those things. 
---
Their damage mitigation and health pools are higher compared to any other class, including pally and warriors, and of course priests. (assuming same enchants and buffs)
---
Natures grasp is op while carrying flag, 
---
cant be ploy'd, can powershift out of freeze and traps and poisons, etc while running. (Think repeat frostbolt or frost shock against a warrior trying to run back a flag)
---
They can go full Healer mode if needed (They will have an in stack / heal set too)
---
Stealth with the rogues for flag return gank squads (They will have a damage set too, and can offer more utility than just another rogue)
---
They can be mid ground support annoyance with roots, hybernate, FF, demo roar, moonfire spam, bash, natures grasp, allowing your team to control mid or effectively farm GY
---
also a good druid twink will has 3 sets of gear, and INT stack, a mitigation set, and a damage set. (many overlapping pieces though). 
---
Also, in a mitigation set you can still get 4 powershifts in with your low mana pool without consumes, you can get more in with your int stack set (Other classes use consumes too...)
---
Your right, druids dont have their full kit at 19, but neither do any other classes, and even without the full kit they still have the best run back and suitability while holding the flag, and while not holding flag they are arguably the most equipped to fill the needs of any given moment. Warriors are also shitty warriors at 19s, pally is still a shitty pally at 19.
---
I am gonna get rank 14 and I find zerging more enjoyable then a 30+ min match
---
I fully understand there was min maxing back then, but according to the survey here from a month back over 60% of 60s have killed Rag and I bet that number is even higher now. That‚Äôs way more than back in the day.
---
"Real classic av". Guess what,  we're playing a vanilla wow version of AV.
---
The irony of horde crying about warlocks
---
Heh, not from a mind control muahahA
---
yep, you're right about that. my B.
---
here's footage from 2008: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQdLlmOURQA

Look how much mana he uses to change forms (it's less than 10%)

and here's how to get more than 2500 mana w/ basic buffs

---
pserver always had 1.12 talents....
---
I only come on reddit when I'm taking a shit, matches with most of the content anyway.
---
I remember 18+ hr long AV battles when it was originally released and no one knew what to do, epic.
---
You are aware that there have been addons in the past to do this, right? You are aware that the last answer here isn't anywhere in the OP, right? You are also aware that "top post" is not common lingo for "OP" but rather in the sub itself, right? You know what's shocking? That your life has to be so miserable that you get your satisfaction from doing this.
---
I've done about 25 AV's alliance side.
---
I've lost 3-4. The alliance bias is huge.
---
There is an orc auctioneer in org named "Thathung"
---
That always gave me a giggle
---
Yeah you are right, they did get spell pen after 1.9 and are still in the game now. I suppose Blizzard is just dumb inconsistent with Itemization in general.
---
&gt; Why would I get mad at a system I've made use of for over 10 years?
---
Over the past 10 years you've been competing against your own faction for a bracketed position dependent on how much Honor you've accumulated for the week in comparison to others on your own faction? On what game?
---
Thanks for answering my question. That makes sense.  AV leans so much to alliance,  I hope we balance it out eventually to not help the horde so much in their honor gain.
---
Do you play a paladin?
---
Confirmed wow is a bunch of old boomers wishing for the good old days.
---
It's an absolutely ancient meme
---
You can probably tell by username that I've played MMO's for quite a long time. I don't think it's just me getting older, either. I genuinely find it utterly disappointing at what the genre has devolved into.
---
To that point, as much as it helps promote gaming I still vehemently believe streaming has had irreversible negative effects on the gaming culture and "community" as a whole. 
---
Oh, well. That's just the boomer in me complaining, I guess.
---
I had a moment today when this got me for a quick minute. In my defense it was my first game and I was tired...
---
I found this interesting the other night (I don't normally watch twitch stuff but I wanted to see BGs since im in the EU)...horde streams are damn boring because of the queues. I had no interest in watching horde run circles around undercity battlemasters waiting for a queue, when alliance were always in BGs. 
---
If horde queues end up being 15-20 mins+ because the BG population goes down relatively more on alliance once everyone has got their AV rep and the casuals have had their fill...horde streamers are going to be massively impacted by this.
---
why do you think this? what reasons?
---
This is great for War Effort, I believe there is one type of fish for the effort that is very common in that pool.
---
I would have still reported them. Fuck ppl like that, they deserve no mercy.
---
It became about the destination basically around the time cata came out. basically when they stopped carrying about the leveling process and streamlined everyone into a "get to the end game" play style. Those players came to classic and thats why we have what we have.
---
thats crazy man, yeah i farmed some lotus for a few hours after work then did two AVs and i have 125k its insane
---
Reminds me of every time I port to Thunder Bluff and I run past Clarice Foster, with her lips sewn shut. For those who dont know, Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs is played by Jodie Foster.
---
You know, I was thinking about it. I‚Äôve heard good things about the combo.
---
Are you implying that the entire battleground was created and updated with the intention of players mindlessly running to the final boss, ignoring all other objectives, cheesing the pull mechanics, and then beating the final boss in less than 5-10 minutes? Like, dude, cmon, this has nothing to do with people wanting "something to be unhappy and bitch about". It's valid criticism to say that the 1.12 version didn't receive the same testing that 1.5 did, and that 1.5 should be the implemented form as it was closer to the original vision for the gameplay of that battleground.
---
That second paragraph is a troll and not worth discussing.
---
This is the most pathetic sounding whine i have ever seen
---
Turns out AV is poorly enough designed that modern players completely break it
---
The way people talk on here would be flat out disrespectful in the old gaming community. People used to trust devs and game developers to make good decisions, and I think that was a much healthier attitude than assuming you are an expert with a better idea for balance or features than a team of seasoned professionals
---
How else am I going to get my group members into the BG ?
---
honestly you just sound bitter and over-reactionary for no reason.   
---
Yes yes, I'm sure they actually very terrible and horrible lifeless people in real life because they teabagged someone in a game, yes that's very logical and level-headed of you
---
&gt; I myself am already rank 9 and can play 100+ hours a week no problem and plan on doing so
---
&gt; see u at the top bro
---
You can't make this shit up
---
Sell your daughter and buy a bigger bed with the money.
---
Problem solved
---
People who enjoy the game are playing it, not bitching about it on forums.
---
Hey fellow pooper
---
A little of the blame goes to blizzard and its because retail has been set up for the "get to the end game" type of streamlined playstyle for a long time now. Hell look at the entire idea of Hero classes. They dont even start at 1. Allied races? dont start at 1 either (unless that was changed i swear my nightborn didnt start at 1.) They made retail into a get to the end game playstyle and that playstyle transferred over to classic when the people playing retail came over to classic.
---
Honest question: why are you playing? What's the satisfaction for you after grinding AV gear? What will you use that gear for? I'm genuinely curious.
---
yo yousse a bitch yall
---
GMs in classic wow 
---
You mean the 3-4 minimum wage guys checking the game once every week?
---

But if that 5% increase would be the difference between being top dps and not being top dps you'll bet your ass ima do it
---
It wasn't satisfaction that made me reply, it was just annoyance at you raging at other people because of your own stupidity.
---
Well, yes, you‚Äôre absolutely right, so that‚Äôs definitely my bad for not being clearer: sleep deprivation affects one‚Äôs mental faculties long before it affects the physical ones, so any job that requires cognitive performance is gonna be tougher when sleepy than a job that‚Äôs purely physical.
---
private server community is toxic af and they dominate the classic wow people.
---
r/whoosh
---
I see a lot of people complain about that, but I don't see the big deal. Alliance is not competing with horde for ranks, but among their own faction. Alliance could get 900 honour + 3 marks and horde could get 15,000,000 honour for the same BG and it wouldn't change a damn thing.
---
Yeesh
---
Well in all fairness to the community, Blizzard has had quite a few bad blunders over the years so its not surprising their specific userbase has lost faith.
---
These are multiple guilds on the server, and what the person said below. Most guilds run 2-4 MC groups.
---
Uh what? What streamers are you watching? All the streamers I watch tell their viewers to play what they want. Yeah, if they are asked what is the "best" they have no reason to lie but they also caveat it by saying play what you want. 
---
All metas in all games are completely irrelevant outside of the highest echelon of play. 
---
The WoW community has always been obsessed with min maxing. You just forgot because vanilla was 15 fucking years ago. Now, those same people are even more entitled than they were back then.
---
That's not really a rather poor example. The balance of the game in 1.12 is drastically different from when Ragnaros was first killed in Vanilla. Most classes had very impactful talent changes by 1.12, most content was scaled down in difficulty, and itemization was changed (with many items being buffed). On top of that, every single system in the game, including the bosses, is more understood now with that information being more easily accessible through sites like WoWhead.
---
To top it all off, the first Ragnaros kill in classic most of the raid was in blues and greens and not everyone was 60. So while they put in a ton of time to get ready first, actually doing the content didn't exactly require min-maxing that would have been out of place in Vanilla.
---
What worries me is what the system will produce with the large server sizes and today's level of competition/commitment...
---
Trust me, this community existed back then too.
---
Our guild made our own Ragnaros timer addon, I found it the other day when looking up some old forums.
---
Not every player was some absolutely clueless casual 4fun player.
---
dont tell the noobs this! let them suffer
---
Dude makes a living by having people pay attention to him, then everyone is surprised when he makes controversial comments on subjects that have polarising views in the community.
---
I doubt he'll get R14, the grind would take too much of his channel time.. playing 20 hours a day doing nothing but PvP premades wouldn't be good content for him even if he has the time for it.
---
WSG is for getting rolled by premades, i'm not sure why people think any type of pvp was gonna be fun, at least this way you can get ranks solo instead of being in a premade which is also super boring.
---
&gt; I was really good at being in the right spot at the right time. Flag room d, ninja capping, returning flag when they go to transfer fc. Etc. Also I can coordinate and communicate a plan well.
---
Not trying to pop your bubble but RBG's been out since Cata and it's a big meme in the pvp community. 
---
Yeah it's two different beasts but they're not comparable in difficulty.
---
I got in one av Game today 4 Times an afk Report becouse in choose to slow down enemy Horde zerg to Push in too fast so alliance can win the zerg race saver. I managed to get 8/3 Kills Just by defending the First Graveyard alone and Just sniping the kiting Guys with some slows and attacking the oom healers. Some Guys Just Charge by and are easy Kills with a slow and the Help of the npc's. If you want to do PvP in av Just stay at the Front graveyard and Charge one time in them to slow them. You cant get kicked for afk becouse you are the only one doing PvP in the PvP battleground. Just Hit one enemy within the 60 sec Timer and they cant force you Out. Btw you can Report the" Rush zerg is the only  way to Play the game" Reporter themself they dont have enemy's to Hit in sight so they will get kicked Out and Not you. Av can be fun If you want to have fun and Not Just brainless zerg shit Grind.
---
Take a look at Kui Nameplates. I've used it before and it can change many things including the colour of the names above the heads.
---
Who's  being overreactionary?  
---
 You are, because you can't psychologically handle being teabagged in a videogame, so you get on your high horse and attempt to psychoanalyze people for something as simple as "they're teabagging you because it makes you mad" because it helps you feel better to just assume something is wrong with people instead of just accepting you lost.
---
So...you want blizzard to balance/change the game? It's an interesting test case, one where many players who are hardcore (and probably part of the 'no changes' crowd) probably want changes to be made - even though the BG is the same as it was in this patch in vanilla. Nothing changed except the way players interact with the game.
---
Thanks for confirming. I know you are just trying to rile me up, probably to feel better yet again?
---
&gt; the same dumb large group pvp we've had for months
---
maybe as a horde, but this is the first time i get to do pvp with even numbers not even close to the same thing. i get a lot more 1v1s in AV than i ever got in the world after pvp system was released
---
I mean, I have a desk job in the military, so I‚Äôm pretty confident in saying I‚Äôve experienced both. If we‚Äôre talking about productivity, I find it much easier to slog through physical bullshit on no sleep than it is to stay focused at my desk. Though, I will concede that both at the same time is definitely the worst.
---
They can but it effectively just works as a stealth detector increase, kinda like perception except they'll show up on the map too (which is basically useless as you'll still need to be pretty close to them to see them)
---
I think it‚Äôs slowly becoming worse tbf
---
People will keep doing AV over anything else because it still gives the best honor/h. Until the honor formula changes it's not going away.
---
Go to the less popular city for your faction and just chill there for a while. People ask you for portals every 5-10 minutes.
---
you get 1100 xp pr turn in off 3 marks at lvl 21 at least.
---
&gt;incredibly skilled player wont manage it either if they only put in an hour a day
---
I beg to differ. Raid logging is incredibly common in mythic guilds. Class rotations aren't very hard currently compared to MoP-Legion design, and a lot of rotations have stayed similar over the years, with minor tweaks. Retail WoW has been stagnant for a while, and once a player gets good, they stay good, just because the overarching mythic raiding metagame hasn't changed since Mists. 
---
Sure, the player needs to develop the skillset, and that takes time, but if you're a genuinely good player, you can retain it with minimal effort. There are farming demands for Mythic right now (weekly +10 and weekly islands are the big ones), but there's no fight where you have to drill for hours to complete if you're good at the game. 
---
There's something like a 400%+ throughput disparity between good and bad players in retail right now. Bad players are doing sub 10k, good players are doing 40k+.
---
It was a basketball player actually
---
One of my characters in vanilla was named Hin, so I recognized this guy instantly.
---
Its great. I was leveling my axe skill (got the Axe from Rag) on my Ret paladin in EPL when this Warrior tried to gank me 3 times. Beat him each and everytime and idk, thats the wpvp I remember and love. Where im out in the world and things just spontaneously happen and I have the ability to actually fight back and maybe even win instead of roaming the world and a 10 man - 40 man comes out of nowhere and ganks me.
---
How is that not boring after like 3 minutes? Sure it would be fun to stomp everything for a moment, but then what? You just roll over people non-stop? Fuck that, gotta have at least a little bit of a challenge.
---
Win trading isn‚Äôt collusion.
---
Win trading is def against the rules - but coordinating with the opposite faction isn‚Äôt against the rules.
---
Also why are you replying in an 8 day old thread lol
---
The singer and the wow character are both references to this guy. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone
---
&gt; If you run premades you can be a crap 1v1 pvper but still be good just by communicating and going to the right places.
---
Which doesn't make u good at the game. There's no place for dead weight in top mythic raiding or arena but a lot of bad players thrive in RBG's which is why it's a meme
---
yeah after playing mobas for over 8 years on high lv I can't stand wow arena.. its only close to balanced for about 3-4 weeks before a new expac's talents/changes launch and even then it's all about comps and gear as requirement before skill
---
fuck! someone was offering gold last night to help fix their fps issues..
---
One of the top players in WC2 b.net way back in the day was ‚ÄúHungLikeOrc‚Äù.
---
As a kid, I totally didn‚Äôt get it. I thought the name was a commentary on the persecution of Orcs by Humans, not a reference to his jolly green joy-maker.
---
Who and why did you pull in mc with it?
---
For me its not a bug, its an upgrade. The spell was  useless before.
---
It's easier in the sense that 'all you need to do' is play for 20h solo and semi afk. Whereas with WSG meta you would need to actually win premades to grind efficiently.
---
idgaf what knuckleheads do when they play video games.  seems like I triggered you.  you didn't read what I said.  I specifically stated that they DO NOT teabag to try and make me mad, they do it cause it's all they know how to do.  you ok?  lol.
---
They're actually both referencing [Karl "The Mailman" Malone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone)
---
Wait you're telling me I'm giving away a fortune for free? Shit :(
---
Bro, you rock. You just gave me a new pet project to tinker with over the holiday break. This sounds awesome!
---
Someone‚Äôs salty lol
---
This really took me out ü§£ü§£
---
The kick happens if enough people report the player as AFK, 1 person cannot do the kick. It is an abused system however with premades not liking a person, and all voting the person AFK.
---
What is the point of playing if you don‚Äôt want to win?
---
Holy fucking shit lol, this was my experience.... It was so bizzare. 
---
Worse I was a class leader too so there was pointless shit expected of me. Have people noticed a trend where for guilds having one full successful raid group isn't enough and now we need 2 or even 3 lol?
---
There goes most of the sense of community and closeness which was a big reason imo in why vanilla was successful. 
---
Just playing other games atm, will return eventually maybe on next raid release so I'm a bit behind with gear.
---
I feel like being on an area 24/7 and being spam reported by humans might be a red flag that doesn't require a ban wave to act on.
---
I think you just want to argue, because it's pretty well established that Classic is a very different experience than 15 years ago, and more akin to p-servers. If you don't think so, and believe that I'm totally off-base with these remarks that's fine, but I really think you just want to be a contrarian. I don't enjoy the hyper-focus on min/maxing that has happened and believe it's bad for the game, and for the experience of most players in the long-run.
---
&gt;you can't psychologically handle
---
salty again.  good one.
---
You can't, and the reason is #nochanges. Vanilla WoW had some dumb and weird design decisions.
---
and mount
---
Mount is later too from what i hear.
---
Slap those goblin boys and/or Tim Allen biker boys back to ~~Lumbridge~~ Ironforge.
---
use tiny tooltip with mouseover tooltips. that way you can see the model of your target in 3d.  
---
or archud. you can turn of the hud part and just use the target 3d model part of it. its not optimal but you can at least see the target model right infront of you and use logic to determine if it is allies or enemies there.
---
How do people not notice that his stance of the day is whatever will cause the most outrage and controversy? He's out for views and advertising, which he gets in spades every time he does something or says something that pisses people off.
---
It's an old wives tale.
---
Congrats on reposting the same joke from yesterday
---
I tend to run with NPC names turned off, i DEF never saw this until today.
---
The community sucks and shouldn't be listened to, and you're completely wrong about the batching lol. People said the game would be dead on arrival without it because of some of the interactions they were used to.
---
I been farmin em all day from the ones near kargath.
---
Downvote for invisibility, sry.
---
If i see anyone going into the cave without going for the Insignia you get my report :D
---
I completely disagree. Instant gratification reigns supreme in my book. There are plenty of ‚Äúthe best things in life‚Äù that are a slog to attain, but believe me buying or having them instantly feels 10x better than the slog. To deny this is delusional.
---
Are the epic pvp legs available now for those exalted with Sentinels?
---
yep! so who's really winning
---
Someone with a name like yours? Never.
---
Not that I don‚Äôt agree lol
---
People are tired of the game in its current state, that's why they complain.
---
It's a lot longer when you consider q times and that you will only kill 1 harpy before the game enda.
---
They are actually crazy people, it is honestly sad. 
---
It can't be that the game is deeply-flawed; it has to be some sort of intentional sabotage that in some way leads back to evil retail.
---
It sounds like you're agreeing with him?
---
Sweet time to boot some peeps with the homies.
---
I‚Äôm playing with my phone. The default setting suck ass, but you can tinker and make them playable for sure.
---
if 5+ people reported its insta kick, if you only get one report you have like 2min or something to hit opposing faction or you get booted.
---
They need to disable the afk report button until a couple min after the av starts. Or just remove it completely
---
I mean does it matter? Unless there's proof of it, too bad. Finding people in the world is easy, especially if they're famous. 
---
Streamers seem to have a real problem with PvP happening when it doesn't benefit them.
---
Thats not exactly how it works.  People queue up first available and if a bulk of the group gets the same number they take it.  They then zone in and afk report stragglers to get their raid members who didn't get the initial queue pop with them.
---
Yeah it works really well to be honest, there's a ton of addons that make it even better, I used an Elite Xbox One controller and was able to fit every bind I needed on to the controller, it's awesome.
---
while we're at it, whats the go with allowing someone to change to master looter.....
---
I'm confused what the point of guilds being like that is. I'm part of a casual raiding guild, we raid with Ret pallys and Oomkins, people play when they feel like it in suboptimal gear. Yet we clear MC and Onyxia every single week with ease. What does being more hardcore achieve at this point other than less fun?
---
C'mon dude. Doubling down doesn't somehow trick people into overlooking how much of a blithering dickhead you're being, you do realise that right? 
---
Literally everything you had spelled out for you was found in the main msg from OP. You were the only one who needed help, hence how no one else asked and that people were taking the piss out of ya. Most people were able to extrapolate any gaps in the information and they did it without getting upset too. Because ya know, they're not dumb angry dickheads haha.
---
You can have up to 10 days worth of rested XP. That‚Äôs 150% of whatever your level is. 
---
At earlier levels, this doesn‚Äôt amount to much, but once you get into the 30‚Äôs you can do full instances at double CP or quest for hours at double XP.
---
Well they are a business, no idea why people think they won't protect their big earners.
---
What is the xp gain for doing this?
---
Greta Thunberg ~ Greater Thunderhawk
---
&gt; you can get ranks
---
Ugh.
---
yup im 3-9 so far in av
---
He wanted no changes because he and his friends could benefit from it. Nothing more.
---
In the back of my mind I feel games, TV etc are too much of a distraction but it‚Äôs posts like this that remind me most of us would be plebeians anyway, and games are a great way to escape from that and get some alone bliss from the physical world.
---
If you remove all the walls in a maze, the mouse will go straight for the exit. 1.12 AV is the equivalent of this. Yes, gamer culture has become all about chasing items and meta shit. But they could fix this by putting the elites all back in, and adding an e potential bonus to honor and rep for the longer you stay in a match.
---
Unless you're gonna nolife wow for a few mknths just wait for BWL.
---
15 mins here or there is still extra time you'll need to play in order to keep up, even if you only get kicked once per day you're talking about nearly 2 hours extra a week. 
---
It's not about them completely stopping you, but they have the ability to slow you down costing you more time.
---
Pretty sure if you type /w &lt;name&gt;-&lt;server&gt; you can do this regardless of bg....
---
&gt;If you want more pvp action in A.V then do some damn pvp, split off from the zerg and defend
---
[MRW](https://i.imgur.com/yNsxyLR.jpg)
---
See this is  the mentality i'm talking about; people say/do something you don't like, so you try to apply childish labels like "triggered" to make yourself feel better.   
---
You can "specifically state" whatever you want, but that doesn't make it true. If you really think people are teabagging because of something as cynical as "they're sad people" or "they don't know how to do anything else" instead of the most obvious and simple answer of "it makes you mad" then again, you're just using pathetic rationalizations to make yourself feel better.    
---
Occams Razor, friend. Learn what it is.
---
Guessing Firemaw - EU? We had a rogue doing that exact thing
---
At least use proper grammar if you‚Äôre going to do this.
---
No raiding. Tanking 5 mans, healing 5 mans, aoe farming with my mage friend.
---
You can pick it up outside the portal but the turn in is inside the base.
---
...Because there is extremely high demand for the exalted rewards. Once all of the PvEers get exalted, there will be a significant decrease in demand, changing the formula as queue times grow exponentially.
---
blue pvp reward doesnt require as much effort  
---
personally i dont care if its 50% faster for the rep to bum rush drek vs 3 time more honor, the rep is already fast enough for me
---
well blame everyone who yelled out NO CHANGES
---
I can see where they are coming from, doing your own thing away from the team and contributing to a loss is not ideal. However, id also really like to have some actual fun in AV, do all the quests once just to see what they are about, and enjoy a little bit of an all out 40v40 pvp brawl.     Perhaps once the min/maxers get the rep/honor they‚Äôre grinding for I‚Äôll get to enjoy that.     But for now I guess both sides of the argument make sense to me.   ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The first faction to kill Belinda/Galv gets the honor/rep while the other gets none.
---
Horde usually have a ton of people immediately go in and kill Belinda, meaning Galv is a waste of time for Alliance. It seems like the best method is to simply kill lieutenants/commanders on the way to Drek, which a small squad can do without adding much time to the BG.
---
It used to sometimes last a day.
---
Bro I feel it. Shitty factory job working 12 hour shifts for just enough money to pay the insane cost of living, and a bit left to save. But WoW Classic time? Nothing quite like it.
---
So the don‚Äôt play?
---
Actively griefing when you could simply not queue up is sociopathic.
---
Thatll work until rogues start remembering to use expose armour.
---
Haha, that's so cool. With castsequence macros I could see it having a lot of potential.
---
Zul'farrak. Your next leveling area is BRD at 54.
---
Your definition of skill is somewhat odd. You're suggesting if something is scripted it doesn't take skill to over come it? A dancer's performance requires no skill because it all scripted?
---
If skill does not exist in PvE (Mainly retail as that is where challenging content is), then what is the difference between the top guild and a average one?
---
It's the people who changed, Classic wow isn't going to fix how people play the game now.
---
This was me last night.
---
Me: walks up to bank. Notices orc INSIDE banker area. *surprisedpikachu.bmp* So then I proceeded to jump in myself and my brain just low-key exploded.
---
All the other plays on words too, like the Turtle escort quest where he's lost, his name is "Torta" and the wife's name is "Tugah"..  Tortuga is turtle in spanish/portuguese if I remember right..
---
av premade exists
---
Are you on Herod? 
---
I am.
---
I have no idea wtf you're talking about.
---
You should do questing and run each dungeon at least 1-2 times for all the quest. They give really good exp. Google which quests are available for the Dungeons, some are hidden behind prequests and cause of that not sharable!
---
That's false. You dont have to min max to accomplish stuff, you just want to. Then you blaming external factors to make it seem like you're some helpless puppet.
---
Cant remember correctly but i think you'd need wolf riding unless you're an Orc.
---
What fish are you getting in av?
---
Said "player not found" around launch when I tried this.
---
Aada
---
It is a symptom of how gaming has morphed from early 2000s to today. I will tell you a couple of reasons why.
---
People have this expectation to min/max these days. They do it with everything, including single player games. 
---
 Part of the reason is the modernization of single player games where they are used to wasting no time in going from point A to B with quest markers. Another reason is some games are so long that people with a life have to be efficient in order to just beat the game. So they don't dive into the world, they just complete a checklist, which can be fun. You see this in games like Skyrim, Ubisoft games and stuff like that.
---
Another reason is people feel like they need to play every critically acclaimed game that releases. So they can't waste time in the games they do play, and they just want to blow through the content as fast as possible. This is part of being an adult, as a kid you have limited resources in the games you get, so you have to enjoy them. As an adult your limited resource is time. For example, when I was a kid I must have beat Ocarina of Time like 15 times or a game like Prince of Persia (Gamecube) like 10 times. 
---
So because of these things, people are always looking at the goal rather than just playing a game and having fun. The goal is usually completing the game or to get higher competitive rank in some game, or in WoW's case I guess honor. Nothing else matters, when in games the journey is really important. Like if you don't enjoy the grind, it might be ok to "force" it for like an hour, but not for 20 hours.
---
Lastly, developers show with short patch cycles in games like League of Legends that you better use the meta build quickly or it will be replaced by something new in a few weeks. Instead of players learning how to counter such things, they wait for devs to fix things and that leads to constant imbalance.
---
It took me a bit, but I overcame my desire to play as many games as possible, beat as many games as I can, because eventually I just won't remember the game anyways if I blow through it. I play games that I want to play and games that I enjoy. Start another game of Civ VI? Sure why not? Like right now I am playing through KOTOR 2 for the first time. Taking my time and enjoying it.
---
TL;DR: People don't enjoy games for the gameplay they have and the journey, they care way too much about the goals in the end, competitive rank or the reward. A quick patch cycle of games today discourage people from innovating and playing things naturally, and cause them to look up stuff quickly.
---
Yeah a lot of people in my guild want to rock AV and grind it out that way. A group of us made a WSG premade and had the time of our fucking lives. We clear MC in 2 hours then go back to WSG. It‚Äôs too much fun, especially as a rogue.
---
Lol truth
---
TIL teabagging is savage and cruel.
---
Seems how i recall, it was always janky
---
But that requires more coordination than a pug can manage.
---
With PUGs, you have to expect everyone to do the same objective.
---
Easy I hate myself, and I keep putting myself in Antifun situations so I can hate myself even more.
---
how about hanlon's razor instead:
---
"Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."
---
Ignorance is bliss
---
EU or US? Because when playing solo queue, I certainly had more games where Alliance still rushes Drek, ignores all Lieutenants and most of the time fucks because they end up pulling too many elites in Drek's room, wipe without having any GY apart from Snowfall (yikes) and the game turns into a 30min turtle. Sometimes it works and we end  the ends the game with 900 honor, and everybody is like "yea another win, this is great". So I started to queue with two friends (Warri, Priest, and me Mage) and we just 3-manned every Lieutenant while the rest ran through to Drek.
---
HoJ is pretty easy to get tbh, and is amazing. LH is a lot harder to get but you will never replace it.
---
It did. It was put in place because before that there was no way to get rid of real AFKers.
---
Haha :) hence why I added the ‚Äòpreface‚Äô.
---
because they're a bunch of fucking losers
---
Yeah.  This game needs some minor tweaks in more than just this situation.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, if you‚Äôre in a mythic+ when it starts you are eligible for loot when the final boss dies; dcs, kicks, and leaving be damned. You get your goodies in the mail if you would‚Äôve had a drop.
---
I appreciate that, it's been so long it'll be nice to get back in the swing of things with someone. I'll be on tomorrow,
---
Damn I really screwed up not doing legion, i've always hated that people could pve for better gear than me, and I hated having to gear out a character that then becomes useless with one patch. PvP vendors were tons of fun though, and you could still outgear people while not needing to be a no lifer to do so
---
&gt; make yourself feel better

cause I'm salty.

I had a 19 rogue twink by the name of Hindenburg on Aggramar

It definitely is the same as Vanilla.

[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11633/spiderfang-carapace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11633/spiderfang-carapace)  is fine too.
---
You seem toxic as fuck
---
what percentage is rank 12? 1%?
---
The vast majority of players in Vanilla never came close to Rank 14. Most of them were perfectly fine with that. Not every possible achievable thing in a game needs to be something everyone can get. If you can't accept that I honestly don't know what draws you to Classic.
---
That's pretty much what I was saying. I like to come on here and browse when I don't have time to play, but seldom have anything to contribute, because I'm mostly happy with the state of affairs.
---
I'm just worried we're never going to see TBC because of the vocal community.
---
No, blame everyone having jobs, and less time.
---
That shit is funny though. Dumb ass noobs lol
---
pservers replicated the original versions of AV and people still used the rush META it was just a little bit harder but still short zerg games no different than this.
---
It's not the design its the players who figured out the best way to benefit from AV.
---
Theyre never going to change it to anything that wasn't like Vanilla so no point complaining.
---
Your rant is on point.
---
Imagine how terrifying that must of been to witness that accident.
---
They changed it to 10g at some point can't remember when.
---
A horde warrior complaining about and alliance warlock? i cant have any less pity for you than i have, its impossible. stop whining
---
Not a complaint
---
Is this post not the pot calling the kettle black?
---
That's what RBG's were for
---
Hi erect.
---
It is true that the mega servers are a big change. But that is not a mechanical change to the rules of the game.
---
It will be really hard to be one of the first people to rank 13, since it's based on what percentage of the population you are for honor and rank.   There are just so many people attempting to achieve it. 
---
But your rank declines if you don't work to keep it up, and once you have the title and gear, there's no reason to keep it up.   So people will fall off and new ones will go up.  If you keep at it religiously, there's a decent chance you might get it come spring or summer. 
---
Even then though, you're going to be dedicating some serious hours.
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt know it worked like that. Back in BC there was an add on that you had to stand next to the battle master and it would que everyone in the party at the same time. I kinda figured they used a different more random system this time around.
---
Any chance you‚Äôd upload your controller layout?
---
What
---
Just derp around and fight horde.  They won't be able to kick you and they won't have your help on drek.
---
Not even the same person you've been replying to
---
Vanilla wasn‚Äôt designed to start in 1,12 either. This isn‚Äôt vanilla. Some people, like you, just can‚Äôt comprehend that. You aren‚Äôt happy because you wanted a hamburger and you went to dominos.
---
Wotf does nothing when the warlock can 100-0 me in a Conflag &gt; Shadowburn combo.
---
People care about the rep more than the honor
---
Fellow poopsocker here
---
The more the match is dragged the higher the chance horde will win.
---
I mean you do seem pressed. So maybe stop acting pressed if being called out for being pressed upsets your sensibilities.
---
If I could redo it over again I'd 100% make a warlock for easy High Warlord but I'm not doing 1-60 again.
---
&gt;C'mon dude. Doubling down doesn't somehow trick people into overlooking how much of a blithering dickhead you're being, you do realise that right? 
---
Calling replies stupid is being a dickhead? I mean, you called me stupid, so that's much worse, right? 
---
&gt;Literally everything you had spelled out for you was found in the main msg from OP.
---
Nothing I said is in there. Literally nothing. 
---
&gt; and that other people were taking the piss out of ya?
---
So you are now agreeing with me that those *2* people gave stupid answers? Are you for real? 
---
&gt;Most people were able to extrapolate any gaps in the information
---
I thought everything I said was in the OP? Can you decide what you are trying to say? 
---
&gt;they did it without getting upset too
---
Only one getting upset is you though. 
---
&gt;Because ya know, they're not dumb angry dickheads haha.
---
Again, insulting me is much worse than calling a comment stupid and unhelpful, right?
---
What was the point of covering up Bommi - Mandokir ‚Äòs name?
---
I agree this would be fun but right now I just want that sweet sweet purple ring man
---
hero
---
Yeah 100% back in vanilla my step dad and I got his warrior to 13, he played 3hrs in the early morning, I'd play 3-4hrs after school then he'd play another 2-3hrs before bed.
---
How is a 2.5 hour AV fun? it's mindless turtling.
---
It's just as boring with next to no reward.
---
The only way to play AV is get exalted then go play WSG and never look back. It was like that in Vanilla and it's the same now. It's just not a fun BG in any form.
---
For you to have a 60, and multiple 40‚Äôs, even assuming a modest 15 days/played, it means you‚Äôve played on average 4+ hours/day.
---
I know personally, between going to the gym, socializing, networking,  reading work and family, in left with 4-6 hours/week to play at most.
---
I think a lot of us knew the population wasn't ready for this game to come back, but to be fair if we had this extent of communication with blizz back in 2004 we probably would have bitched too.
---
New to the game I see, yeah the caster ring isn't in the game yet. Sorry bud
---
This hits soooo close my thoughts on the game. The same people crying about the bad stuff are also doing the bad stuff! Just enjoy the game and don‚Äôt be apart of the problem.
---
Alliance warlocks are broken. Blizzard completely overlooked balance when they decided to put paladins and warlocks on the same faction. Nothing is more OP than a Warlock with holy paladin support.
---
&gt;Idk about those stats but seemed like it was pretty common based on all the ‚Äújust got both bindings‚Äù posts.
---
How many people are posting "I didn't get/see a binding" after every raid? One of those is going to far outweigh the other.
---
Hi, completely happy on PvP here.
---
Gaming subreddits are now full of a vocal majority of feckless whiners. It's hilarious how much of a circlejerk reddit is. (Not you, just in general)
---
Lol hoj "easy* 
---
Cries in 100 angerforge kills
---
didn't they say it was originally added in a later patch?
---
The long turtle AVs are the fun ones too.  And the rep and honor rewards for long AV's actually aren't that bad.  I had a 41 minute game give over 1000 rep.  I would have probably gotten in ~3 zergs in that same amount of time, which would have been ~1200 rep, but infinitely less fun.  
---
Those long push and pull battles are awesome, getting out of there with over 200hks doesn't hurt either.
---
It depends on what you consider fun. I'm not sure how this is a problem. You have fun, this is a great thing. I have fun also, also a great thing. We probably wouldn't have fun being in the same raid team, and that is also fine.
---
Thanks, I was getting 5fps when I zoomed in on myself with the WSG flag carrier gfx effect. 60fps again now, and you've fixed a guildies game as well.
---
It's blizzards fault because the game is tuned incorrectly. Players do too much damage vs too weak NPCS - this is not the players fault. AV is almost totally empty compared to its original version and the mobs that are there are empty shells. I shouldn't be able to practically 1-shot seasoned guards at the graveyard flags with multi shot but here we are. My team still had like 9 people kill drek w/ all towers up while others were trying to have fun camping middle, that should not be possible.
