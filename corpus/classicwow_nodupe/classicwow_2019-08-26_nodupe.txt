Oh. Good. I saw something about that, and didnt like the idea. But, I figured we'd have to deal with it.
---

---
Glad the devs agree with me. ;-)
---
Thanks for the answers.. I've had a crazy week and havent been able to keep up.
---
---
---
Did the devs go into any detail about a "direction" that classicwow is going to go, or is it sorta just gonna be preserved as it is as a relic?
---
Is their a website keeping track of server pops?
---
I'll settle for the most basic of basics - skill trees.
---
If they only add skill trees, I'd be happy. At the very least, it'd be as playable as WoD was I.E., making alts will be pretty funny.
---
Rip, is that you? :)
---
I don’t know what that is
---
Same, I actually personally prefer playing on low-med pop servers. More of a community feeling
---
Mages like to tailor, and in theory you can bank a bunch of cloth along the way and catch up fairly quickly.  (if you can avoid the temptation to sell it)
---
**Perfection.**
---
No voice chat in game so have to use discord or battle.net chat. Might need a splitter for that headset to plug it into the mic and speaker ports on the PC separately.
---
Sure, its Cleanz

As someone playing classic for the first time, what would you do differently?
---
Cheers G, going alchemist for the guilds sake so I'll save these
---
You literally are an arcane mage casting frost bolts.
---
&gt;that 29 year old boomer playing classic wow while sippin a monster energy drink.
---
*crack*, *sip* ahhhh vanilla wow, now that was a game.
---
I dunno, it was fine? 30+ by the looks of it, it was like 4 years ago.
---
Im guessing you wanna be one of the first few thousand to hit the button when it get enabled.
---
Famous in a video game lol
---
I already posted this on here but I figured since it's launch soon and my first release was just made (with major improvements over last time), I'll post it again.
---
What this addon does is:
---
* Shows you what level each class learns their spells
---
* Also shows weapon skills for all classes
---
* Tells you the price for all spells and weapon skills
---
* Allows filtering for talents/known spells
---
* Right clicking a spell marks it was unwanted (makes it red)
---
* Shift-right clicking a spell marks all ranks of that spell
---
* Left clicking on a spell pins the closest trainer to your map and minimap
---
* If you have TomTom it will pin using TomTom instead
---
This.

---
I don't think people are completly sure about this. The game is Classic, yet they're using a modern game framework. Meaning, both modern addons and 1.12 addons might not work and have to be rewritten. Don't quote me on it, I'm not sure either.
---
Rip rip! Heyo dude! Lol. Fancy seeing you here haha.
---
I'd bet people that are saying the community, that doesn't even exist yet, is toxic think PvP in general is toxic. It's all fine and good if you want to play on an RP server that can't be interrupted by cross-faction fights, but calling it toxic is silly. Dynamic events that could erupt into a battle are the entire point of RP-PvP realms.
---
No it doesn't, lol. Contrary to popular belief, history doesn't repeat itself, and you can't look at the success of vanilla and say that Classic is going to have the same amount of success. Especially when vanilla was at the right place at the right time, and mmo's today are no where near as popular as they were even 10 years ago, let alone 15.
---
what did you mean by this
---
The balance druid durotar duelist
---
No rly, I'm going to duel everyone and MAKE MOONKINS GREAT AGAIN
---
Just my wee joke ^^
---
Not gonna lie, im starving right now and all of that looks fantastic.
---
Or we could talk about it while we also enjoy the game. Nobody is saying fuck Classic, where's new plus Classic. We're just making conversation. Chill dude.
---
Confirmed, after exactly 30 minutes I got kicked off. Disconnected from the server, error code WOW51900319
---
yup. also hunters are crazy good in pvp. a friend of mine is pretty fit as a hunter and killed a R12 rogue and warrior who tried to jump him, when he was lvl 57. imo they are easy to learn but pretty hard to master in terms of multi target micro
---
Just take some Benadryl followed with a little dilauded and you will sleep for a good chunk of that time.
---
Dude, it’s just an opinion on the effects layering has to RP.  I even say that I think Vanilla is great.
---
What’s your problem?
---
Red Leather Bandanas is not a Deadmines quest. None of the mobs in the instance drop them.
---
F
---
We prefer to live in the plumbing.
---
Why?
---
Do you really think you won't play retail again at some point?
---
I'm really torn on what I would want tbh. 
---
On one hand I'd love them to continue adding content to Classic, keeping the same level, vibe and everything. 
---
Adding to the longevity of the server is what I'd be down for. 
---
BC on the other hand was my favourite expansion apart from Mists of Pandaria (don't laugh I had a great time) and I would love to go back and experience it again. I do think that the hype wouldn't quite be the same as Classic, as the majority of the current player base joined in Wrath and Beyond, BC still had the same leveling experience as Classic and you can still access the world today (unchanged from Cata). 
---
If this experiment succeeds and we see new and old players come to classic and stay then they would be the ones building the hype for BC...
---
I can picture it now... some 17 year old who started in WOD playing classic and getting hyped up for BC because they never played it... getting to experience it first hand like many of us did back in the day.
---
I work 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off, I fly home the night of the 27th. I feel so lucky.
---
Ok thanks
---
People aren't thinking about costs enough. Blizzard is still a business after all. Making new content is much, much harder than simply updating BC.
---
Also a lot of people will be excited to play BC again too, so it's really easy marketing.
---
You dan join it.just u may have a queue but u can create a character
---
you \*can\* try to log in 30mins before launch , not sure if there will be authentication queues and realm login queues though , everyone and their grandmas will do that
---
We don't know.
---
They have said that with the framwork they have built for classic, releasing TBC wouldn't be a huge challenge.
---
How much health do they restore? Do you really have to remain seated while eating them?

I don’t know what the second half of your post means though.

You do know it’s the exact same generic shirt only photoshopped right?

---
Yep good luck with that.
---
&gt; Classic has a end
---
It doesn't have an end dude, endgame is called rolling an alt and go do it all over a different way.
---
I plan to use Classic to quit on my depression, so this checks out.
---
Dont even worry about it the recommended specs are practically 2004 computers.
---
Lmao those will be filled in 5 minutes after the launch
---
not how this works bro
---
Try here:   [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/) 
---
Apparently many addons are being updated to 1.13, and tested during the blizzard stress test.  
---
Still no guarantee they will work on day one though.
---
All that skill, wasted.
---
Hey man, I really appreciate the in-depth (well, to me at least) reply. I wanna ask one more thing, specifically of Paladins. I’ve heard that they aren’t as good as a Warrior when it comes to being a tank because they lack a taunt iirc (and DPS as well?), but also they don’t heal as well as a Priest so my main question would be, does a Paladin have a place in the game if he can’t really front line DPS/tank but also isn’t the best healer? Like, if you have to play a Paladin as a healer at 60, wouldn’t it make more sense to go with a Priest? Excuse my ignorance and thanks again for the reply :)
---
Yes, drag into your interface -&gt; addons folder
---
Maybe but I feel like the team that is running this game is not operating that way and to be fair it also seems like activision has yet to be any big part of the operation but I could be wrong.
---
Wow folder -&gt; interface -&gt; Addons
---
Not yet.
---
I coincidentally aligned an appointment to have my wisdom teeth removed the morning before launch. I also made sure I had the next few days off to “recover”.
---
yea you're definitely a boomer by internet standards.
---
meh, viper sting can fuck a shadowpriest over... imo they are the hardest class to face as as a shadowp. but still strong in 1v1 tho
---
Full means you can expect long queue times at launch. But even on high or medium queues are possible. Blizzard also said that servers hold more people than they used to in vanilla. So a classic server at medium capacity has more people than a vanilla server on full.
---
Pretty much, but instead of horde, kill alliance scum
---
I would personally recommend ClassicCodex, it fills the same role as Questie/QuestHelper, but better.
---
As far as I understood from the latest interview I watched, they basically said that right now they are open to pretty much every option. Continuing into TBC, preserving it as it is and classic + (sort of like old school runescape - they continue to do updates I guess).
---
Classic is nothing like vanilla?  Then what the hell have i been waiting for all these months?
---
I remember playing on a stool for 2 years (mid MoP) until Legion came out.
---
When i bought a chair, my back was thankful.
---
I’m just excited for classic
---
Just be a warlock and solo him with ease
---
Both and probably none as well
---
ahhh MAN i totally forgot about seasonal events and fishing tourneys and stuff.  And darkmoon faire?  I can't wait :D
---
I think a wow classic similar to the approach of oldschool runescape would be great
---
Not dead but I would expect a drop-off after the first sub month is over.
---
[This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DkVqAbuX0AAoV8W?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900) is a true ergonomics expert

I'm a PVE player who is planning, against all better judgement and sound advice, to play on a PVP realm in Classic. I'm basically anxious as hell that I won't be able to do anything because of these kinds of shitbags that love to pick on players that can't fairly fight back.
---
Sry my English is pretty bad. He can download it. But it's a 100gb file. Mine is juste 2go. He don't have the option "classic" just discover
---
tis trash, but tis my trach

Literally I never care for stuff like this... but.your post is amazing. I loved it. What a good job. I miss wow classic so badly.
---
Were you unaware Reddit is the bootlicker to China now? They’ll sell out for anything.
---
Just wait till the 60s start popping up. They'll descend upon the lowbie lands like locusts and wipe out Hogger every time they spot him for lulz. You might not even see Hogger, he'll become bigfoot. Just some legend you never see.
---
Well Blizzard said it’s not going to be in game so we are good.
---
Central here, but we normally work at the same time as eastern. It's a nice release time.  I'll be leaving work an hour and a half early to get home in time to grab some Chinese and get in queue before release, but wont have to burn vacation.
---
Thanks for the info, appreciate it.
---
No CT Mod? That was *the* vanilla add-on...
---
Well this and the frost tree didn't have any talents that increased raid damage deep into it. All the ones that did were available while also getting arcane power. The same is definitely not the case for fire, where trying to do the same type of full arcane plus fire spec leads to a lot less crit, no improved scorch, and mana issues.
---
This is what nightmares are made off.
---
They recommended players move from high servers too.
---
Spellblade dagger?
---
“The only reasoning I can think of is they WANT to take layering off as soon as possible so they are warning players so they make all the servers more even so that were not all waiting on one server to die off enough to remove the layering early( or delay phase 2 until that happens)”
---
Yes they have repeatedly said exactly this, but my answer is still valid, the reason for layering has nothing to do with the queues it has to do with the amount of people in the same areas at start.  The server caps are set , so adding more layers doesn’t help if too many people try and play on the same server. Layering is in place to help the players not have to fight 5000 people for mobs at the start, it came about because they want to have servers to be full so that as people that decide to not continue to play in the coming weeks and months they don’t have to combine servers to have an active population and the servers they have now vs the vanilla wow servers can handle a lot more. So adding more layers will not stop queues it will only make the layer your in seem deserted , the queues are going to happen because of the server cap not because not enough layers.
---
Im from Central Europe and Ive never heard anyone using 0:00 like this,.... its always midnight of the day before, 0:00:01 is the first second of the new day, not 0:00
---
Promitere.. Salutare.. Coa presto, matuere..
---
The classics. Thank you!
---
Should us Australians be concerned that our only PVP server has a high population and we've not had a single blue post mention?
---
I have a feeling we're gonna cop ridiculous queues and the response will either be silence or "have you tried not being Australian?"
---
I haven’t played WoW since vanilla with my older brother and going to start playing classic now that I’m a senior in college and have a ton of free time. Was thinking either an orc rogue or troll warrior. Anything specific I should know or do starting out or just play and enjoy the experience/grind?
---
You may yet be able to kill Rag- people will eventually just run MC pick-up groups like a dungeon group out of chat!
---
&gt; So this Huntard is coming for your Dal’Rends bois!
---
Isn't a pair of enchanted bone slicing hatchets better than enchanted Rends? I remember that being the go-to for hunters.
---
Luna Unit Frames has 3d portraits
---
This looks so uncomfortable
---
This is EPIC
---
They are all high or full except the rp server
---
Great Job! Looks very useful.
---
only way to not get booted out is switching servers but you might get stuck in a queue , anyway assuming everyone will try to log in 30 mins before realms are up , assuming blizzard splits the second the most probable thing happening is the queueing will start in those 30 minutes , no chance at all to just \*log in\* at -30 , realistically people will start queuing at -40 , the time necessary to scroll the queue will make so that you will get to the character selection screen between -30 and 0 mark so that you'll have minutes worth of time left to log in . 
---
TL;DR try loggin in before the 30minutes , if you are in queue you'll be golden . better than getting in queue at exactly 25 minutes left to launch
---
I see on the log ins "Breaking News" that maintenance is scheduled Tuesday aug 27th 7am PDT. I thought they said they weren't going to be doing maintenance the first week.

Yea I screwed up and out classic on my HDD when I played the stress test back in June.  So maybe I can uninstall that, then copy the WTF, then reinstall on the SSD and overwrite the new WTF folder with previous classic WTF folder.
---
That sound right?  Lol, thanks for helpin, I just want to make sure it's perfect

I feel like I'm the only person on the planet without a 3D printer.

There are far too many addons for Blizzard to review that break the game, give unfair advantages, or straight up ruin the game.
---
Blizzard needs to just make an “addon store” like the google/apple store and only allow you to download and use Blizzard Approved™ addons(for no charge, of course).
---
Careful, this post isn't "about the game"
---
Tantamount to a ... "gasp* ... "battlestation" post.

Oh noes!

You go have your desire to be excited and have fun somewhere else!  We'll keep finding things to bitch about here, instead.
---
i personally used twitch app to download them, and just update them when it's needed.
---
That's the Alliance's ass.
---
Dude. I am an OG player, and I am super thrilled to play classic until about level 50. And then I am out. Maybe even level 60 if I am still having fun at the end of the grind. 
---
The leveling experience in classic is amazing. I already had my glory days of getting a bunch of server firsts in classic wow, and I know that those raids are just not something I can commit to again, probably ever.

---
Didn't they say they updated the combat log with 1.13.2? Omen etc works from reading the combat log.
---
I would like it to rotate between the original trilogy, but I don't really know how that would work.  I don't think it's necessary to go past WoTLK, that expansion is like the last core warcraft story line.
---
I was thinking of doing the same with my orc hunter!
---
Sounds like it's just a riff on a Long Island Iced Tea, which uses tequila just fine.  Cuervo sucks.  If you get better tequila, it should be fine.  
---
Espolón and Altos are both pretty inexpensive (around 30 per bottle) and *way* better than anything José Cuervo makes.  Blanco (the clear stuff) is better for Iced Teas than Reposado or añejo.

They already said in their recent Q&amp;A that servers will be added if needed. Obviously we'll need more servers as of now but I'm not expecting them to fire up 10 brand new servers or anything.

I actually really love them... and you might not believe it.. but I found them in a garbage at a hotel.. they were just sitting on the top of the can. I thought I’d have to fix em up but they work perfect...

this is so amazing
---
3D Printers have become quite cheap over the years, an entry level ender 3 is \~$200
---
Lucky you! I still can’t get the sh*tty Blizzard Desktop App to actually work on my Mac, so guess I won’t be playing.
---
Hah, fair enough.  My first class was a warlock, and my rogue friend wondered how I had so much money and was super jealous of the cheap mounts.
---
Easy to make money when we don't have to use a bunch of it on abilities for reagents, poisons, etc. (or greatly benefit from weapon upgrades - melee classes were definitely looking and grabbing from the AH for better weapons, while casters can just wear random green stuff and be fine)
---
But yeah, I think it's like irl where some people spend as fast as they can make it, because I'm pretty sure I knew at least one person of each class that was like that.  No wonder gold selling was so big back then.
---
Only if they rework the terrible itemization. Gotta love being forced to wear cloth/leather/mail as a Holy Paladin, because all sets below T3 have useless stats and event T3 lags behind cloth drops from AQ40.
---
The fact that so many specs simply do not have any endgame gear is honestly the biggest reason I see why Classic will dwindle eventually. People want stuff to strive for.
---
&gt;The world got smaller: We went from an entire planet, spanning two continents, to like 6 zones in TBC. What's worse was that the people who were leveling or midlevel were alienated from lvl 60s.
---
Exactly, every expansion is like downsizing of world. every player just moves to another area, rest is left to dust
---
I'm going to play a lot but I'm not focusing solely on leveling. Crafting, questing, fishing, gonna enjoy it all
---
You means the millionth “PSA: remember to have fun!” Post wasn’t doing it for ya?

Well, that would be a change from the classic experience if they banned them :D

Oh yeah, I'd like that!

I've never wrote a WoW Addon but glancing at you code and some API it seems rather easy to add, do you think something like
---
    C_Timer.After(UnitLevel("player") * (2.0 /60.0), function()
---
    	SaveView(4) -- Saves current camera position
---
    	SetView(5) -- Switches to default camera position
---
    	Screenshot()
---
    	SetView(4) -- Restores previous camera position
---
    end
---
    )
---
would work? (Assuming the animation runs for approximately 2 seconds)
---
Yes but not if the item is already soulbound. 
---
There is NO bind on account items in classic.
---
You'll be fine. Game is easy enough to get into.
---
One less thing to have to alt+tab to wowhead for. Awesome!
---
At any time in the future, do you think you might possibly consider adding in a section or simply text that tells a leveling play if a spell can be skipped to save gold for their mount?

I've always wondered if any horde actually run deadmines? Seems like too much a hassle though the Grom'Gol access point makes it not as bad as I thought.

What is there in Classic that would require a water breathing potion?
---
Thank you so much! This was it!

Don’t get me wrong I love the bone slicers. But a set of Dal’Rends is on my bucket list.

---
Theoretically there will be more bag sellers and more bag buyers. So the price shouldn't be impacted by an increase in population. But in this case he's banking on the price remaining high because no one else (or nearly no one else) is selling them. As the server pop increases, there is more likelihood he will no longer be unique in selling this item.
---
It's land lubbers.
---
If you are in a party with someone questing, does wow classic give you both less experience per kills?

Welcome to classic wow btw, you're in for a real treat and a grand adventure no other game can offer you.

Congrats! I am sure those names were in high demand.
---
The thing is. That yep you could make burning crusade seperate and keep classic as is. But classic has limited content. Even giving it 4/5 years it would die a natural death as you could clock the game with all gear and such. It has to expand somewhere and I would want original content and not TBC.

Im hoping the friday night que aint the worst. Got a free weekend to level the rogue.

---
Brilliant
---
I think there's a warlock quest?  Maybe a handful of other quests.. or if you wanna stay underwater longer to pick Stranglekelp, or to out-dive someone chasing you in PVP.  Not a ton of solid uses but it's fun.

how can progression be horizontal if it raises your max talent points?

With this whole layering business I wonder if it would be possible to create a TBC layer on the same server that you move over to once you go through the Dark Portal.

What sucks for me is I had my roster change.

Originally I was going to have 3 days off this weekend. 
---
Now I gotta work this weekend...
---
Bigglesworth biggest issue is it’s pst. It’s the best server name in wow history. If it was est it’d be more hopping then Herod.
---
Lol
---
xD
---
Make sure mom doesn't find your piss-drawer or she might ground you from the wifi before launch
---
Hyjal, korgath and Kil'Jaeden. VC.
---
Imgur is often blurry on mobile but fine on PC in my experience.
---
this is kinda the cheapest way to go about it.. technology has advanced so far that any 'gaming' desktop you buy at around $500-800 will be able to run any game out on the market. 16 gigs of ram is standard and if you wanna upgrade later, you can just buy the individual parts and change them out. But i wouldnt waste time doing all of that for now, you just want something that'll run.
---
Dirty hands, clean grinds. Get it brah
---
There the door buddy. 👉🏻
---
Definitely #1 tomorrow
---
I feel like half of everyone I saw in the wild in classic was a hunter anyway
---
I used Twitch in retail but I couldn’t find a way for it to differentiate classic addons, went ahead and just installed them manually.
---
I am pretty sure you lose %1 of your total life when you eat all of it.
---
Why cpu are running?  My work laptop with no GPU actually crushes retail on medium - high settings with only the integrated graphics.
---
Np man, just trying to save people some frustration when it comes to random items.
---
Oof.
---
Between account sharing and route optimization, there will be 60s by the time I'm 20 probably.
---
One of my favorite memories of vanilla was the leveling experience so to each their own, I'm going to be enjoying mine.  Might even forsake rested exp.  I'm in no rush.
---
Paladins are the best (rivalled by mages) at soloing mobs for grinding mobs (especially undead mobs). 
---
Protection paladins can farm huge amounts of money in Dire Maul once it releases, if done right.
---
If you're talking about the leveling experience, levelling a retribution paladin / warrior are the two hardest classes in the game.
---
I’ve accepted my fate. I’ll do a couple college assignments and hope for the best.
---
Yo. Can I get some of that dilauded?

God dammit. I literally got my favorite name on skeram. I was really hoping it would stay medium population and I wouldn’t have to deal with queues...
---
Yeah, that's enough reposts of this already
---
I don't get the classicwow.live guide.
---

1. Die in Loch Modan
---
2. HS

3. Spirit Rez at IF gates
---
4. HS to IF
---
That doesn't make sense. what am I missing?
---
My timeline for phase releases will help or hinder classic, imo. If the releases are staggered over time allowed for plenty of old-school lore enjoyment then classic will have a steady strong following. 
---
I can't speak for all players but I'm personally looking forward to leveling at my own pace, learning the horse lore side that I didn't know before (former alliance), and then finally start raiding. If blizzard starts pushing phase releases every couple weeks it will just provide incentive to rush 60, speedrun everything, BiS all the things, and generally suck all the enjoyment out of reliving classic. IMHO of course.
---
You took Spirit Bond...
---
Is typing VC instead of DM THAT difficult? Yikes
---
Let's not act like Vanilla is hard. You can bring along plenty of meme specs to your raid and be perfectly fine.
---
So what you're really saying is...you're hosting the launch party, right?  Cause I want some of those ribs.
---
Yeah I actually enjoy healing find it way more fun than DPS but I like to change it up. I wouldn’t mind filling that for raids but I’d def like to go DPS for dungeons and such. Guess I’ll try out both Paladin and Shaman and decide on Horde vs Alliance. Thank you!

More thunderfury for the rest of us

How long were you sitting staring at the character select screen desperately waiting for Enter World to light up before you noticed this?
---
Looks like you’ll fall asleep early on that diet.
---
Lemmie go grab it from my personal in homeb pixis.
---
I honestly think that they'd release separate clients for both BC and WOTLK and maybe give a "Copy Once" from Vanilla&gt;BC, then BC&gt;WOTLK of your characters, so that you can progress that character on the new BC/WOTLK servers but still keep it static on the Vanilla servers. I don't think they'd make you start all over at level 1 to level up to 60 before you finally went to Outlands or Northrend at 70. 
---
This is my hope, anyway.
---
Nah. It's better when you can put a lower rank DoT on them which slowly but surely kills them. And type /hug /cry
---
Blizzard releasing a unfinished product smh! *SAD*

If blizzard was going to designate certain servers as being in permanent end game classic mode forever, they would have already done that, in order for players to know which server they should join.
---
Trump 2020
---
what am i looking for here????
---
There is currently no way to know.
---
The Shazzrah and Firemaw EU Discords are evenly distributed when it concerns faction balance, and I'd think that applies to most other servers too. Play what your friends are playing, or play what you like best.
---
What's the difference between the last 2 options?
---
3 days to reply.... at this point fuck off XD lol

On retail you can do 1-60 in a weekend, probably less.

When does vanilla starts? 28th?
---
It's a big issue for you but not the people in PST time zone..

They're about to invest an absolute assload of time into the game, while misguided it is natural to want some kind of assurance that things won't go the exact same way they did before.

Full disclosure - I played a mage in vanilla.  but, priests were the most powerful heals and got the most raid spots.  for leveling, really any healer will get the job done.  my advice - play what appeals to you the most.
---
ROFL
---
I don’t eat when I play. I’ve stored up a good amount of body fat.
---
my birthday is the 27th as well! its gonna be nice here so i might take my laptop up to my porch and chill there a bit while i play

He did pre-screen it on another monitor. The guy that sent him that sent him a .gif that was a wow character and turned into that NSFW picture after a few seconds when he had pulled it over to his primary monitor.
---
This upcoming weekend.
---
If they aren't playing the game exactly the way I enjoy playing it, why the fuck are they even playing at all?!
---
Unfortunately the story is always the same. People want to finish raids as fast as possible. Especially if you're doing it over and over again so many times. Therefore the classes that can generate the best results are going to be favored over classes that won't.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Hunters are middle to bottom of that pack when it comes to PVE content. You'll do fine in PVP, but PVE is not going to be where you shine.

Lol, presubbing isn’t wasting money but ok. Good names mean a lot to the player.
---
Saved! ha good stuff :P
---
I envy your position. Please dont worry about it.
---
5-6 business days I'm assuming.
---
Excellent, thank you!
---
Not very long honestly lol
---
Not possible to do it in 24 hours.  I am thinking 3 days 12 hours played will be close to the new record
---
that was it ty
---
Oh god where do I start? Tostitos and salsa, Cheetos, crackers cheese and kielbasa, 6 ham and salami sandwiches, carrots and salary with a spicy ranch dip, chocolate bars, peaches, and a 12 pack of dr pepper. This is for 3 days though, haha.
---
4 more are coming tomorrow.
---
then troll all the way. shadowguards low manacost + chances on proccing blackout is just flat out insane in a pvp enviroment. 
---
DP can be easily dispelled and has a freaky long cd + huge mana cost.
---
AH is shared between all layers. Stop being delusional about layering. I can't tell if you're being cheeky or not though.
---
12 hours a week! That's awesome. I'm hoping to squeeze in 5 or 6 haha.
---
Oh, you're one of those. Yeah, no one says that outside of your little group. Have fun, dude.
---
For me it's community, but how character progression was approached facilitated that.
---
You’re going to have days/weeks of playtime over the course of leveling. 
---
You’ll be surprised how just playing will naturally get you accustomed to things. 
---
Roll what you want and learn along the way.
---
Just practice it for a bit and try to setup some macros. Overall it's not that hard once you do it a couple of times.
---
Tell them no, and if they insist demand another off week then.
---
First few days are going to be a dumpster fire anyway.

The base wow game has changed quite a bit from the original. Leveling is faster and easier and many people dislike this direction. The entire world and many quests were also revamped in Cataclysm so many of the zones have completely changed from what they were in vanilla wow. Not sure about QoL options as I haven't explored that far but I'm assuming most of it is back to basics. So basically we are getting a harder grindier more social game...and old school quests.
---
Have a look at this link here. https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/
---
There is also an addon called Azeroth Auto Pilot - Classic out on the Twitch client.
---
My dad passed this year and he loved playing after I introduced him and my mother to it. He had a Gnome Mage by the name of Nutrut
---
Thanks for the serious moment OP
---
no one used it because it didn't work. It was just a button you could click if you felt like clicking a button.
---
how often are you drawing him? every 5 levels? every 10?
---
And shoulder
---
And ribs
---
And ankle
---
And all the other shit he had.
---
Andrew I wish best of luck... see what I did?
---
Nah. I just want to spend time with some cool people in a guild. Being their main tailor or something would be cool, but I wouldnt be bothered if that title went to someone else.
---
I don't know your industry norms but that sounds bad.
---
Destroyed a lot of poor Horde souls on my 39 pvp warrior with this. Most fun I've ever had in WoW
---
I agree this would be best. A good way to reward the classic players who put the time in and would allow players the ability to jump back and forth to different characters to do things as they wish.
---
Thanks this is awesome
---
\&gt; Sections  2: Core Concepts and Section 3: Mastering the Market on the Kindle  version both have the exact same sections repeated. I assume this was  not on purpose, so I am most likely missing a complete chapter. Great,  insightful content, otherwise. I do wish I could read the full material,  however.

This is a review from the book on Amazon, has this been addressed in the Kindle version?

You should tell blizzard, because they gave up trying to solve it.

I'm seriously considering farming rep for the Troll mount for my Undead main. Is it worth heading to Durotar shortly after hitting the easy Brill quests to catch those early quests to save myself some rep farming? I'm not sure how much rep I can realistically gain before level 20 by doing so and I imagine it will slow me down if I try to quest in the busier zone.
---

---
No buddy, "your little group" is you guys. Oh gosh you are gonna be in for a rude awakening when you log into the game and read the public chat channels for the time.
---
Run them through dungeons and/or help them with elite quests/ quests that they're underleveled for (happens quite a lot in classic).
---
They allowed Gnome DH?

I meant to to say viper the hunter should die before you run oom.

My brother got me into wow when I was a kid. He passed away a few years ago. Strangely enough, it's his birthday tomorrow.
---
Personally as a buyer, I'm more likely to bid in a short duration item than a very long.
---
A very long item, I'll just buyout, because I expect to be outbid given the duration.
---
Any bid is a guaranteed sale, so I can see the upside to it.
---
Run em through dungeons.  The better gear they get the more efficient they can level.
---
Sort of. The demand for things like Edgemaster's will be very low early, but the supply will be WAY up with 5 layer's of people in their mid 40's. Also, almost no one will have gold for a long time, the demand for everything will be low, while the supply will be massive. 
---
And that is why I made this thread =)
---
If you're willing to lie, sure just say you're holy.
---
100% this, especially if they have level 60 friends. If any of my mates had issues with being ganked my rogue was more than happy to come pay a visit. You do not want a vengeful player who loves PvP *and is invisible* looking to teach you a lesson about not being a dick.
---
Hard to say since you didn’t list your class, but if your class has decent aoe you could have them tag a bunch of mobs and as long as your aren’t in group they will get full xp when you kill them
---
I said CCP not eve. Like how they were one of the first companies to push for cross platform play with Dust 514. The reason it didn't happen was xbone pulled out. Or how Dust 514 was a work of art, and they get shit on for it... and really every game they put out except eve.
---
Think of it like the same thing that makes dark souls appealing being applied to the mmo genre.
---
Many of the changes in retail that made it easier/more convenient to click buttons and immediately be slaying monsters and getting loot also had the unforeseen side effect of making the game less challenging/community less meaningful which was a big part of what made Warcraft stand out to begin with.
---
That's the best tl:Dr I can give you.

I think you’re right - Fury up to 40, then respec for Mortal Strike.

Thank you, will do!

Yep. The 28th at 1:34pm EST. Dont be late!

Classic is a vastly different experience than current retail WoW. A lot of stuff has changed, notably stuff like sharding (everyone has an "own" world that he shares with players from different servers), an automatic dungeon finder tool. The general trend was going from a game based around community to a polished, almost singleplayer like experience. Theres a lot more, like a lot of fluff getting removed, no challenges whatsoever etc. but everyone will tell you something different.  
---
The hope is, that WoW Classic will have the old sense of adventure, community and challenge that current retail WoW is lacking.
---
Oh yeah, youre right!! My only bill is $15/mo now! Am full-time lock now.
---
that would be insane.
---
Word of warning to everyone - the quest "Wanted: Otto and Falconcrest" is really, really hard.
---
Just left clinton township. Great place.
---
I was having issues trying to add a sub to my account within the battle.net app. Try through a browser! :)
---
Too bad you miss out on basically the entire game.  
---
The sense of community is unreal. On PvE everyone holds hands and sings songs. Yawn. On PvP, the Horde and Alliance fight a fierce war. Any time higher levels gank lower zones, people always come to the rescue to protect their domain. There's always a sense of camaraderie. The funnest is when the realm is new and leveling up so clashes are almost always near equal level horde vs alliance once zones start melding. Those are the best fights when a fight between one or two people turns into a giant zone wide brawl of 20v20  
---
  
---
If you're crying about dying you're probably taking things too seriously. This game isn't even 1/10th as fun without world pvp.
---
How server looks is the number of random people running by you that make you feel like you are not alone. How a server feels is the number of friends you have on a server and the guild you join there.
---
I can't control how the server looks so why should I care about that? But I am very much in control of how it feels to me.
---
Not Retail server but.. I did a transfer from troll to gnome on a Elysium server a few months ago and it bugged xD

How can we make our UI BEFORE classic launches? Making it on retail doesn't exactly work due to a different API and different patch number. Are there ways to setup our own Classic server, if so, how?
---
again i think that would be insane
---
All you need is one credit card.
---
Other than providing them with gold and items or helping them with quest runs through dungeons, you can't do much till they're early to mid 40s at which point you can tag level them.

If you have similar armor/weapon needs, keep your old stuff when you get upgrades and hand em down.

LFG wasn't introduced until halfway through wrath
---
He isnt sure, hes just very upset because he prolly wont manage to get into MC so he wants to make himself feel better. Maybe he cant accept that some people are able to play more than he is.
---
yeah that would like i said be insane. but realalistic.
---
You will mostly use macros that switch the stance for you.
---
For example: If you want to use Charge (requires Battle Stance), you just make a macro that goes into Battle Stance if you're not already in it and use Charge.
---
And it's mostly a PVP thing.
---
If you're a tank you will be in Def Stance 95% of the time with no need to switch.
---
If you're DPS you will be in Berse Stance with no need to switch.
---
Stance dancing is a joke, not sure why people imagine it being so hard.
---
Yeah I haven't found anything that fits my needs on that site
---
I think those are OG glaives so Rouge or Warrior could be, but I am not sure.
---
Scarab Lord though.
---
Something tells me that a Wednesday at 11 am will have short queues if any at all. Sure, it'll be busier then, than it will be in a month at that time but I wouldn't worry about the working hours, the evenings and afternoons will be the biggest issue. Then again, I could be wrong.
---
nice
---
i actually wonder how those people would do it.
---
I'm.not talking about guilds using discord 
---
It's the server discords with 1000's of members from both factions using the LFG chat rooms to find groups rather than doing it in game.
---
That's no diffrent than using the classic LFG to make groups rather than the ingame chat.
---
Both segragate the community one force people to join public discords not guild ones to find groups
---
The other forces people to use an addon they dont want to use to find groups
---
If our argument is no one is forcing you to use discord then the same can be said for classicLFG
---
I decided I'm exclusively playing Rogue so I can enjoy being a terror to anything that moves.

---
That's your opinion. You can raid with any spec.
---
Rogue here. You do that to me and you are 100% being killed every time I see you in that area.
---
I don’t gank and if I’m out levelling or farming I leave people be... you kill me though and I will happily spend my afternoon returning the favour.
---
You think the current playerbase is 13 million people?
---
I dont miss the giant eyesore of a tornado
---
You can't. just play with default for a while and slowly change it while flight paths, boats, or running
---
Sane respecs. Having decent access to respecs is good game design. 100g to go back and forth is WAY too much. Oh well.
---
The calendar. It was an awesome tool for keeping track of guild raids, Darkmoon Faire and everything else thats in any way time-based in the game.
---
go out, do things, meet people, group with them. 
---
you will know everyone on your server. they will know you. do you want a reputation as someone who sits around waiting for someone ELSE to help them game, or as someone who takes the initiative and plays nice with others?
---
your reputation will matter here.
---
Preaching to the choir.
---
Yeah, you don't respec to tank/heal, but other than that he's right. While leveling, everyone is dps specced, so it makes no sense to forbid healers and tanks from rolling on dps gear.
---
It's one of the few advantages hybrids even get, being able to collect different sets of gear for difference situations.
---
From the AMA, the devs said the "Enter World" button would just light up at 6pm EST. I would try and login as soon as you get home, do you can get in line.
---
You'd probably want to try and take the pulls slower than normal, so your healer has a bit of time in between to replenish their mana.
---
Everything should be as it was originally unless otherwise stated.
---
Yes, there are videos to get the lesser and greater one and then just drop it. You could also just buy one off the AH, whatever you prefer. With launch, there will likely be a surplus on the AH at good rates
---
Might be too expensive to start off with if you're going to ditch it. People will use the early greens and or sell them for high(relative) prices. You could sell wands yourself to make money but it may not be feasible depending on how the early econ starts out.
---
You rock!
---
This is the exact problem with going to TBC, even though I agree it was probably the best expansion including the base game. I'd you go to TBC you HAVE to allow classic players to stay on a fully classic server if they wish, thus splitting the community. This will inevitably lead to WotLK, and so on until the player base is strewn across 5 different legacy servers.
---
Classic + stops the cycle from repeating. We don't just want to ride the same ride over again. Everyone has their own favorite xpac and everyone will stay on whatever one they like the best. Which is bad for the gaming experience. If we have completely new content made strictly in line with the classic values and game play then you have something people can really enjoy.
---
I honestly feel that we should leave the game as is and go for tbc instead. (Solves alot of the balance problems) I play this game for nostalgia not because it is the best balanced game in the world. But only the future will tell.
---
Well I plan on mainly going cats, and was going to try having both bite and claw early to see if it was any good or if I should just focus on claw only. Just wasn't sure if I'd be utilizing bite so I left it off for now.
---
Leatrixplus classic
---
Exactly what I am looking for, thank you!
---
Interesting. So it's a single "server" in an abstract sense, but it's really just a system that is "future proofed" by being able to respond to demand by adding or removing servers in response to load.
---
I'll take a fake laugh track over stupid shakey-zoomey cinematography (The Office, P&amp;R) bullshit. When the cameraman is jerking all over while rapidly zooming in and out -- it's so fucking distracting.

---
Eh, I'd rather give it a minute or three of leeway than risk doing it a second too early.
---
Look here to see what servers people are bitching about long queues on, and rolling on a different one. I won't be able to start til 2–3 hours after launch.
---
You don't have to alt tab out of the game to use discord you disable your in game chat and later the discord LFG and trade channels for your server over your game
---
After the game has been active a while  [https://realmpop.com/us.html](https://realmpop.com/us.html)  might list faction balances.

But if you are going to go in blind Alliance is usually a safe bet as the underdog.

Because people have called 1.12.1 "vanilla" for years, and thats the version we'd get.

And no, you probably wouldnt want to play WoW version 1.0 for very long.
---
Where is that setting located? Can’t seem to find it in the client or in properties
---
Well, you specifically said all problems are solvable ;)
---
But I don't believe blizz did it because they mismanaged (or didn't want to sacrifice) the resources, I think they realized there's waaaay too many factors to consider for it to be remotely reasonable to achieve good results.

Should possibly note that a lot of the oils go on to make other stuff within alchemy. So its 1 part getting the fish, but then using it for something else.

IIRC oil fish was for the free action potion which is a popular thing.

It's been done before. The current record is around 4d20h /played. There are some groups of people who will probably try to play a single character 24/7 to try and break this record.
---
I think there will be server issues that will possibly cause the actual time to be delayed into later in the weekend.
---
Tailoring is really good. Robes of the Archmage are BiS for a long while and bags are always awesome. Enchanting is a huge money sink though, I would go tailoring and a gathering profession.
---
Meh, I think they just don't want people playing Classic because it shows how poorly they've done. Remember, you think you do, but you don't... That guy won't get fired if he's still there, he'll claim his actions built up the hype that lead to the success of Classic due to the wait, and he'll get a raise. 
---
Let's be honest, Blizzard's successes lately have been by accident, not by intention, as all of their intended plans have failed while their throw aways have done amazingly.

---
I mean the guild is basically a TV show about people who play original wow together...
---
Even just getting through Naxx will take an really long time once that phase comes out. I don't think people are understanding how the progression in Classic works. It's not something you can do in a short amount of time. Even getting to 60 is going to take the average person months.
---
thats not a glitch, that's a feature

Quest addons are for the weak of mind and spirit.

i will be sitting through the queues waiting until i'm allowed in, because i'm in charge of starting the guild charter! probably will have Netflix on or something while i wait :)

Would be cool if all realms had a fun little easter egg tied to their namesake. Classic isn't particularly "clean" or "fair" compared to Live so I could see something like this maybe happening if they were to do Classic+
---
Not to mention he played for a scumbag team that threw an entire season just to draft him, didn't care when he got hurt and let him keep playing, and pretty much ruined any potential his career had to move to the next level.  Good on him for getting out.

anyher + for leatrix +, it's pretty much the _LazyPig you know and love.

And blood elves ruined the horde and faction balance. Can't forget that. Suddenly I was in parties that consisted of nothing BUT SLIMY ELVES! As a horde! I hated it everyday.

I leveled hunter in vanilla and it was really hard to get a spot for raids and stuff. They are a great solo class for leveling but they definitely get the shaft in end game. You’ll also be fighting rogues for gear the whole way, not that they are the only classes who fight for gear but still. It’s just something to be aware of. If you are a good hunter you can dominate PvP though. Your best bet is to find a guild, establish a relationship with them right from the start. I actually am planning to level a warrior or priest just so I don’t have to worry about raid and dungeon spots. But leveling a clothy on a pvp server sucks ass in general (while leveling) I also leveled a disc/holy priest in vanilla and it was awful but definitely worth it in the end game.
---
Yeah lol. Idk why he had tailoring and I was too noob to realize it was weird at the time. Maybe he was trying to be the bagman of the server lol.
---
You the real mvp. 
---
Saving these for later.
---
Yeah all my friends are on whitemane as horde and herod for alliance. I don't want to play on either of those servers tbh Haha. Too crowded and I wont even be playing enough to keep up with them. I've been playing longer than any of them though, so I dont really have to worry about being lost haha. Just want to enjoy the grind!
---
Type in add on in the search bar.
---
You can do this for literally any question you have and get a more immediate answer. Then people wont have to see a helpless child who hasn't figured out the internet in 2019
---
Lmao at those hunter shoulders
---
Hard disagree. I'll be rolling a pure dps class, and I still think healers and tanks should get equal rolls for dps gear while leveling.
---
At max level, I wouldn't accept a healer who rolls on caster gear, but while leveling, it's totally fair game. "Healers" are just dps who had the good sense to keep a few +int pieces while leveling anyway, it makes no sense to bar them from rolling on dps gear when that's what they're doing 99% of the time.
---
I also doubt you'll get a healer/tank to agree to only roll on healing/tanking items during leveling dungeons, they would have no incentive to come. Instead of having a feral druid heal in int gear, the feral is gonna say "well then i'm dps fuck this".
---
Classic WoW =/= Vanilla WoW Pservers
---
Classic WoW runs off of modern WoW infrastructure, which is entirely different from the original. Addons that work for WoW Vanilla private servers won't work on classic.
---
Cloth isn’t a bad idea but I def recommend leveling first aid as you go if at all possible since it’s a great skill for any class.
---
No worries, just head out and punch out a few quests, hearth back when they're done or you run out of time. You won't be breaking records certainly but you'll still find fun and challenge along the way. And probably run into a few people that you can group with while questing, classic is like that
---
Rolling incendius for a few days once it opens tomorrow. If it fills out I'll stay.
---
Music to my ears. Elves have no place in the horde. Keep screaming.
---
Sounds like your job needs better employees. My girlfriend used to work full time for city paratransit and her coworkers would constantly fuck her over by calling out and she had to pick up some of those passengers/schedule. I'm glad she started college again.

Cool beans!
---
Just remember that once you've blown your proverbial load, you're basically weak and useless until you CDs come down.
---
PVP and PVE are basically a race to get shit done before you're on full CD, otherwise you're like a helpless kitten.
---
No, nothing helps, not even being creating a character. 30 minutes without actually logging in and you are out
---
Suddenly I want to spend some "quality time" with a KindOgre in the Barrens
---
It releases after normal work hours in NA. But I do understand your point.
---
Let's get him boys.
---
I read that vanilla WoW took at bare minimum of maybe 3 1/2 days of play time to get to level sixty, so you're sure to have plenty of fun just with soloing for an hour or so at a time.
---
I assume he's talking about raiding, where fire really isn't viable in MC.
---
In the good old day if you had a dc you held your spot in game for some time not sure about the exact time but I kind of remember 15 min (high probability of being wrong). So if you log on fast enough you should bypass the cues
---
You can though. It won’t actually run processes in 64-bit but will let you play WoW. I know this for a fact as I was doing this for BfA until I upgraded my processor. And if you have verified key for Windows 10 you can download the repair tool to reinstall Windows 10 and just select 64-bit. It will most definitely install and will most definitely let you play. Hype!
---
this is their best option for player retention, release content in the spirit of classic that doesn't add or change any existing systems, just gives you more to do with them. Like new raids without a new raid-tier, but make them super difficult like modern raids are or new dungeons.
---
You’re awesome. Thank you
---
It didn’t that I remember. Think it was just stats and “you have earned a talent point” or something like that
---
Thats true, i always forget to level my First Aid. Thanks for the reminder!
---
Yep just did
---
I'm not THE verycoolguy 
---
I did reserve the name on grobbulus though.

I'm only watching this now, and it's too late to go grocery shopping. Welp, guess I'm starving to death :)

Be careful, Incednius is too cool of a server name to avoid getting memed to full

1g start 50g cap, I don't know the rest.

WTT **Leon** on **Herod**. PM me if interested.
---
The perceived irony of this was never lost on me, and I contemplated it as I was writing. 
---
Then, I remembered that my post counted with myself as positivity, whereas your post counted as negativity, which is what made the difference in my mind.
---
Me being negative about your negativity is positivity. If we call out people who are unkind, it is itself a kindness, even if it is perceived as unkindness by the person originally being unkind. If I am impatient with other's impatience, I am ultimately imploring others to be patient, even if the person originally being impatient perceives my impatience with their impatience negatively. If you see someone having fun while writing a P.S.A., and you try to ruin their fun, you are the bad guy in my book in that particular instance. 
---
SURE, many will know by now that buying every talent from the trainer is a fine way to reach 40 without the gold to train riding skill and buy a mount, but if it's *helpful* information put across with *kind* intent, and you cry out in frustration against people trying to be helpful and kind, I'm going to speak against you, not them.
---
Horde I believe
---
Honestly dont even worry at all. 90% of the fun in this game is just experiencing it all for the first time and learning it all. You'll have all your buddies with you helping you too I'm sure. Just relax and have fun with it! Immerse yourself and goof off too!
---
I just want this to be near the top so people see it: You could sell prints of this. Beautiful art and a rabid fanbase? I mean you really could. It's awesome and unique. Excellent, excellent work.
---
What guild on shadow moon?
---
I’ll be lucky if I get an hour in a day.
---
Will it be worth it to play?
---
Between Work and family I only have an hour or so before I go into work if that.
---
Yeah, it's a PiTA to get between dungeons. I was going through them all on retail yesterday to make sure I know where they are and the layout on ones I was less familiar with, and it takes forever to get to a lot of them, even with a flying mount. It would probably take an hour for a group to get to Scarlet halls/monastery if they weren't leveling up in that direction already.

I know on that part I was being facetious to make is sound more like what the people who wanted it banned made it out to be becuase it sounds exactly like what discord is doing with its server wide discords.

Wod could've been cool if they expanded on the world like they had planned.
---
Server tech is super interesting in 2019. They have the ability to have those additional servers on hand in a matter of seconds after filling out a few prompts and clicking next a few times. It's literally just a wizard being fed a server configuration file. Pretty awesome shit.

Same exact boat Pve and pvp wise. I’m mostly leaning towards shaman because I will have a mage alt. And I don’t want two cloth wearers. Back when I played priest switching to shadow for pvp cost me a lot of gold and didn’t feel worth it.
---
Helpful tip on that boss: pull him back onto the docks a bit. That way, when he stuns you, he has a long way to run to get to his chest. The stun ends up wearing off before he gets back, allowing you time to heal up or reposition.
---
link?
---
I believe they plan on release a handful of new realms alongside tomorrow's release. Whether that specifically applies to Aus pvp realms is anyone's guess but I would say probably
---
Don't you get less rep when the quests are grey?
---
Seems like it's a toss up between them relaunching TBC expac onward or going the Classic+ route.
---
I imagine they'll likely retain Vanilla servers either way.
---
Looks awesome man. Enjoy you both
---
No, thats the dungeon finder, LFG existed in BC.
---
The dungone finder introduced cross realm and teleporting you to the dungeon, the LFG tool didnt do that.
---
Amazing lol
---
In the addons page in the client it has a drop down menu at the top that lets you choose the installation you want to use and it should recognize both retail and classic.
---
Bahamut is that you?

Of youre good at math and baseball what class should you play?

My mains were Undead Priest and NE Hunter. So I would pretty much need a skeleton for the Undead Priest and 15 years ain't shit for a NE.

I played the stress tests on my DOGSHIT laptop and guess what: it ran at like 20 FPS 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I did! My orc warrior in vanilla was bald and had only beard stubble, plus the face I chose looked like someone in his prime. Now I've got long gray hair and beard, the face looks older, more wise.
---
Best comment.
---
The link isn't working for me :(
---
I wasn't sure, he was pretty vague in his question.
---
The server I was going for recently hit Full. I’m conflicted about switching to a Medium server to minimize login queues. My concern is sticking with a Full server and the population doesn’t go down; or going with a Medium server and the population goes down (I prefer a medium-high or high-full server - for example I play on Sargeras on retail).
---
Awesome! 
---
I’m glad to hear it.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
xD this is so true, give them what they want and the y will always beg for more.
---
Common it was a manner of speech or whatever it is called. Good results may be impossible for them but better results than what it is surely is not. We should be striving for perfection even if it is out of grasp at first sight, and in those moments even if we fail to achieve it we will definitely get something better than what it is right now
---
Ironically classic+ is a zoomer idea, no way a real classic boomer would say something so stupid
---
Left handed I assume?
---
hey hot stuff, wanna meet up in Brill? I'll be waiting in the upstairs bedroom ;)
---
For the Boy King
---
I believe it is horde.
---
The horde has some really nice quest rewards that help a ton in the first few weeks.  And their racials are far more potent in the early part of phase 1... at least for WF attempts.
---
Yeah, good luck letting a noob run back by themselves at the end of Maraudon. 
---
I’ve seen people get lost, accidentally pull a pat, and then die, and then repeat it, and end up logging out or hearthing,
---
Where can i see how many Alliance / Horde are playing on one server?
---
pvp servers are optional. if you can't handle ganks then play pve.
---
Honestly it's just as good with a casual approach. You can really take your time and enjoy the world and all the little interactions while levling and doing dungeons.
---
You get disconnected after 30 min on the menu with your characters (if youre idle or not). You don't get kicked off the realm list though (at least in the 50 min i tested).
---
Damn that was a great game. I was half hoping they were going to work on a newer one for the modern age. It never got enough credit or exposure imo.
---
I know it's kind of bad to admit, but I ll get a social life through classic wow
---
You sure you want to try WoW classic if you're really that lazy and inconsiderate?
---
they do have a decent pvp spec but not a decent pvp role.
---
And remember-- there's no reason to undercut by more than 1 copper.
---
It will be
---
Np glad to help and excited to play!
---
Vendoring stuff from skinning is really only viable for a day or two from release, because nobody has any money lol. Even then you may be able to use it to barter with someone who has LW for green items or other profession mats
---
This is kinda silly... wand cheat sheet? 
---
\*saves it, just in case\* :)
---
They can't charge to much ... You can buy a wand from the vendor at level 15 if they are to high
---
but BC has flying :/
---
Tank may have a bit of a learning curve as it's a more difficult role to hide noob mistakes.  My piece of advice is to let your group know you're new to tanking or a dungeon.  I think people will be more inclined to help and be more understanding if ya wipe.
---
I have my self done both a hunter and a mage to 60 exclusively solo in right at 5 days played. This is without a guide and without being highly practiced, it is not that difficult a feat.
---
So with proper planning and food, drink, drug preparation this is easily done by a solo person in a marathon style of play, even easier in a situation where you have a competent person able to continue playing for 5hours while you sleep once a day.
---
Pretty certain you can get gravestone at 18 or 19, low lvl for bfd, but a priest could probably get away with it.
---
Grobb hitting high after Lirik decides to roll there. Fuck me.
---
Hmm. Hope he keeps seeing you play it having fun. That’s what got me back then. He might be a tad old. Is he out of the what my dad does is cool phase?
---
Any chance you might be making one of these for engineering ?
---
Just avoid the high-pop servers and roll on the new ones.

Need the twitch app

Tank, as healers are typically easier to come by.

Pick up a cheap used GPU locally and resell when you get the new 2080. You can try it on integrated graphics I guess, but an RX 480 or something would tide you over a bit more comfortably.....

Isn't pve generally dominated by alliance due to paladins? From memory almost every world first except for KT went to an alliance guild, and most private server, server first went to alliance.
---
He's either going to be into it or not. Today's generation doesn't really enjoy working hard at something for a long period of time, so it really depends if he finds joy in it or not, hopefully he does!
---
Oops he stoned himself
---
Welp he's gonna have to make the walk sometime lol
---
Yeah if it wasn't for the aggressive phasing/sharding cata would have had a decent amount of potential.
---
&gt; The Blizzard UI is pretty well made as is. 
---
It's not bad  EXCEPT the unit frames. With vision issues trying to see health and mana while any numbers are turned on is next to impossible.
---
But that's my take on it and why I use Elv so I can make the health and power bars large enough for me to see.
---
Classic had a limited lift cycle, at it constantly climbed through the entirety of it. While wotlk peaked, it started to decline.
---
Get ready to eat dirt over the next 6 months.

Pretty sure the devs said no scheduled downtime on Tuesday, can't find the link tho.  There could always be unplanned downtime, ofc.

The game is not a race, it is a marathon. Enjoy the marathon.
---
The marathon will have lows and highs. Some times you'll just be stuck in a level where quests are either too hard or too easy and leveling is taking longer than before.
---
Things will pick back up. Try not to make too many alts and stick with one or two characters all the way to level 60.
---
Big mistake a lot of people make is making 5 characters who all make it to level 20, instead of one or two characters who make it to level 60.
---
The content at level 60 is worth getting to, even though leveling up is also a lot of fun.
---
today's kids are used to 30 mins games. (like MOBAs and shooters etc...)
---
They want to be in action in the first 5 mins. They ain't got time to get 10 spider legs.

I'm glad tho, this means servers will be full of +20 years old people.

You may be correct but I'm not entirely sure. I had thought the rep a quest gave was consistent throughout, as opposed to the exp given
---
oh god not these posts again. this has been talked to death for the past two years and every time the answer is no.
---
No no I truly mean their own servers for 1.13, Classic (not vanilla wow). I saw it was done back when people were datamining the game. That's how all those graphical menu screenshots game out.
---
If you are comfortable, post where you live. Some kind stranger may be willing to help
---
Yeah but they got it to work with worgen tho
---
Only when your in game to clear afk
---
So hypothetically once I'm in the menu, I should have 30-60 minutes before having to go back through the queue?
---
I had opposite faction /spit and /rude way WAY more than they ever /wave . That was a PvE server though, maybe its different on PvP.
---
Yes, ElvUI has some working nameplates.
---
I made mine exactly the same as vanilla.
---
The only difference is this time I will main my Rogue instead of it being a pvp alt on a different faction that became my main in TBC (switched from Alliance PVE to Horde PVP early TBC)
---
I've always wished I would have chosen Rogue as my main in vanilla, now I get to do that.

I am basking in all the hype.

I truly mean classic servers. Remember back before the beta, people were able to run the client on their own computers and look at the way the shaders looked, looked at terrain, etc?
---
anyone else tear up? . Damn Ninjas
---
It takes me years to get burned out from WoW, I am not worried.
---
It wasn’t my intention to suggest they wait till a higher level it just read like they thought first mount was at level 20.
---
I feel like with any RPG its about having fun and having your own journey. Will things be exactly the same? No, definitely not, and if you played retail when WoW was first released there definitely was a certain sense of wonder. I dont expect to have that again; I think though, like any RPG, even down to a pen and paper campaign, starting fresh with a totally new group will produce a lot of fun and interesting experiences. I personally started in Open Beta at 16, the game had so much to offer and wrap my head around. That was the trial run, I leveled all kinds of characters, probably to the detriment of my main character, however it was a lot of fun to learn what this game was about. All these years later itll be good to know what i like, and have a fresh experience knowing ill have fun, not get to 60 and realize I hate my character.
---
When you feel burnout coming on, stop playing for a while.  It really is that easy.  Boot up Steam, check out some other games.  Go engage with other hobbies even!  WoW isn't going anywhere, and you'll be all the more appreciative to return to it after some time away rather than forcing yourself to grind through something you don't feel like doing and poisoning the well for yourself.
---
It's nice in idea. But we know it won't really happen that way.
---
I'm casual so I'm just gonna fuck around on the lowest pop server until the initial spike dies down. Then I'll roll my main when the populations stabilize.
---
Yeah haha, I think that's got a good bit to do with it. We played through a lot of games from him being 6 and Mario bros on the Wii to just last summer with The Forest.
---
He doesn't seem interested with gaming/hanging with dad anymore which I totally get.

Was just wondering if anyone had a "sales pitch" or something lol.

Do they work?

Priest heals will get into raids and dungeons with the fewest questions asked.

As far as fun goes, depends on what you find fun.

You dont need to understand them because none of us really give a fuck what you think

You only have 4 gigs space on that drive? That's probably it.

I think Classic would be great for a new player.  I used to be a hardcore raider (TBC-Mop) and I came back about a month ago and find retail WoW almost unplayable and it also feels impossible to catch up in gear and experience (just understanding all the changes over 5-6 years).  I never played vanilla wow, but I did play TBC which isn't too much different from what I can tell.   
---
Classic is a chance for everyone to be on equal footing at the very least.
---
Started playing in late WOTLK, but I had most fun in MOP: I got familiar with the game, but not bored with it yet, zones were beautiful, my social circle in game was big and I had a LOT of free time to play.  It was the perfect match of circumstances that made me enjoy the game the most.  
---
Didn't care a lot about pandas, but they don't bother me, I just don't play them.

Buy laptop, then return when gpu comes in. Ez fix, next?
---
yeah well if i burnout i do not go back and by the time i get back if i go back i lost so much time that i get frusturated and just quit(in retail i met idiots who told me even though i had the same amount of gear that dropped from the heroic raid it was not carry and i was to go find a guild to carry me)
---
Is your friend me? lol!  I feel the same way.  I think I've been turned off to recent expansions, especially BFA, because I feel like if I **need** to keep up.  I don't like the feeling of having to do my "WoW chores" everyday.  I too mostly just resorted to leveling random characters for fun.
---
I literally can't wait to play classic and do the level grind casually (and have it feel rewarding/without pressure).
---
Get him to watch some streamers play it then, or videos of them doing dungeons or raids or whatever. That might entice him. But i do totally understand the gaming with dad thing.
---
Both. Warrior main with mage alt.
---
Ok, so don't play the game :)
---
That's where this question came from funny enough. That post particular post got deleted tho for not being meme enough or something, so I figured I would just straight start the conversation

Guys, relax. We are grown men who have been playing WoW for 15 years. There is no "hurting their sense of accomplishment". We know what leveling is like lol the game "re-begins" at 60 :)

Whispering people with 'You are the bomb' was also priceless

Actually, in phase 5, a bunch of catch up gear is getting added, just like it was in vanilla you might not know about it, I certainly didn't until the AMA. And sure, guilds will still be doing older raids, but the ceiling on your progression is going to be lower unless they end up going the route of level 60 forever. By raiding isn't the only end game I wonder what you mean, do you mean PvP, where you're going to be at a significant disadvantage if you get to level 60 a year into classic? Or do you mean just sitting around and being social?
---
I don't expect all veterans to do it nor do I expect one player to help everyone on their server, but there is nothing stopping you form helping one person and changing one new persons perspective of  classic wow.
---
I think the ironic thing is that I would totally take this if they decided to go back and finish it.
---
Same.  There's nothing more enjoyable in WoW Classic for me than that pure feeling of becoming stronger.  Every level you have something to look forward to and everytime you get an upgrade, you REALLY feel more powerful!  Every new skill, every new talent, every new rank up helps your character grow and in turn helps you grow as a player.
---
Okay I got it. Thank you and I'll see you around kind stranger!
---
Sounds like some retail bullshitery at least wrath didn’t have LFR just LFG ;( but overall I really enjoyed wrath so I would like to see the original trilogy return...

Except it's not, to me, even though you believe it is. That's why perspectives are interesting.
---
Say you're the bully, because you are right now. Say you're shoving around another kid. I walk up to you, and I punch you in the mouth. Am I a "defender of the bullied", or am I "bullying you (the bully)?" 
---
*YOU* will doubtlessly feel that I'm bullying *you*, but *I* will feel as though I'm defending those whom you're antagonizing, because the people you're antagonizing did nothing to willfully address you in a negative way, and yet you are willfully addressing them in a negative way.
---
It's all perspective.
---
Underrated post lol he is the nicest guy in the league
---
Gnasty one at that
---
well the issue is finding a guild that i can raid with that accepts me going to bed at a decent time.
---
Casual raid guild: “everyone needs to be raid ready in 15 days or expect to be kicked.”
---
A big woah from me dawg. You are like the epitome of yikes.
---
Hello there
---
By not doing that shit. It’s easy. Realize it’s a game you don’t have to balance you life around. you don’t have to play from the moment you get off to the moment you go to sleep getting up and immediately playing until you need to go to work. Im seeing too many people who have “lost the plot” and turning WoW into a job.
---
I am gonna play rogue in classic. I played wow retail for a couple of days and i liked it but I thought there was way too much stuff to know. So classic seems it might be a good slow experience and a fresh start. I chose rogue cause I am a noob in a pvp server so I can just stay hidden and be safe from getting ganked, and ganking seems fun.
---
So what are the ways to make money? I think I am gonna focus less on leveling and more on earning money cause everyone is gonna be racing to lvl up while I try to lvl up stuff that would make me rich.
---
You’re gonna have a hard time finding an example of a country that is capitalist and doesn’t have a capitalist state steering the ship.
---
Got to expend all that nervous pre-launch energy somehow
---
Wait what? The whole point is that retail is fucked. It's the only reason Classic is so hyped.
---
His comment was clearly satirical.
---
Paladins are really solid. And after MC probably alliance will win most WF due to them.
---
But early weeks the horde racials just barely squeak by due to the fact it's just a flat buff rather then something that scales.
---
Will be interesting to see who wins though.
---
Don't really need to advertise a game where every available server has been "full" for days before launch
---
Fuck em if they don’t respect the fact that you’re an adult with adult responsibilities.
---
It looks fuzzy. Like its actually from a screenshot from 15 years ago lol.
---
why would someone be waiting for classic wow in 2004 during vanilla wow
---
i know its super easy for me to burn out happens all the time with me.
---
There were class leveling guides back then with info like this.  And twink guides.
---
And just like back then, we'll still have loads of people with mishmashed gear on these servers xD.
---
What
---
"full" doesn't mean you can't make a character there, it just means there are a lot of people on that server. You can create characters there. If it's not letting you, then either there's some sort of technical problem or you're trying to make too many characters (you can only have 3 characters during the name reservation period) or you're trying to make two characters in opposing factions in a pvp server.
---
Spot on, I re made the same Orc Shaman as back in the day, but with grey hair and more facial hair
---
That’s Azeroth’s ass.
---
I too just saw this movie on netflix
---
How are 30 year olds born in 1989 boomers?
---
I liked Chuck Norris jokes back in simpler times, like in Vanilla, and before I learned about Chuck Norris IRL. :/
---
i am guessing drugs are for you.
---
&gt;classic wow is the most casual friendly version of the game.
---
How? There are so many more things you can do in retail as a casual player.
---
Nothing, that's the most frustrating.
---
we all now that launch time will be dumpster fire, queues, and a mess.  
---
But this one, will be our mess and im going to love it. I cant wait to see old Mulgore again.
---
I'm trying to uninstall and reinstall right now because I read I need to update the client for Classic to even show up. It won't even let me uninstall lol... Like, the uninstaller starts up, then goes into background processes and doesn't do anything.
---
Can you change the name I'm a priest irl and having something named that might cause the authorities to show up
---
I cant with retail. When Ive tried to log in and make a new character, then people start driving by me at lvl1 with tier looking armor, on a motorcycle "The fuck?!" immediately log out.
---
Huh? It sounds like you're agreeing with him, but you're doing it in an argumentative way. So confused.
---
'full' isn't really full, they just say that to imply that "hey you might want to go to a different server to balance out the server population"
---
You can still make characters on full servers, but you might have issues with queue times.
---
Listen, I understand that, mechanically, WotLK added a lot of things that people don't like. The Dungeon Finder, easy epics, death knights, etc.
---
I don't like those either, they suck, I get that.
---
But man oh man did I just love the setting and story of that expansion. I really do think it was peak WoW, in that regard. I haven't had as much fun in an expansion since.
---
I intend to be the guy that I wish I had found. (Moosh, Myzrael)

Good shit

That’s exactly how that was yesterday lol

wireless mouse for gaming... fuckin casual
---
&gt;in reasons for playing the game  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Raiding and dungeon content
---
you won't like this reply... but pick the class you will enjoy playing the most.  maybe you like the lore behind mages and the kirin tor, and enjoy ranged DPS... roll mage.  if you like being in the thick of it and wearing big armor sets, go warrior.  with the amount of time it takes to level in classic, enjoying your class is most important.  
---
my opinion is that everyone in the forums is too focused on endgame content.  that ish will figure itself out when you get there.  play what tickles your pickle.
---
True true
---
&gt; Say you're the bully, because you are right now.
---
You can stop there
---
Think of it this way- most people will be in the login queue anyway most of the evening tomorrow!
---
It's not an opinion that people abuse the use of single use plastics and it's impact on the environment it's fact.
---
If you don't care about changing bad habits to make sure this planet is habitable in the future then my opinion is that you shouldn't procreate.
---
The appeal is to go back to a simpler, harder game, heavily built on social aspects.
---
The current game streamlines so many things that even social interaction was heavily affected, to the point you don't need to talk to other people at all to see 99% of the content.
---
It's like going to a trip with friends and choose your own way to experience things, versus getting on a bullet train with a guide, with all the content curated to give the "best experience", based on their own opinion.
---
i personally dont agree mostly because a 40 man raid makes it a bit hard or impossible to know everyone 
---
i loved the vanilla raids but i feel like the bc ones were more refined and a bigger challange, all of them were very very unique , really cool bosses and great looking gear
---
not to knock vanilla its great but i think they made improvements on a lot of things most notably classes in bc
---
not to mention all the zones were great 
---
id say bc felt like a much more modern mmo which could be a good or bad thing depending on your views
---
So why not just go get a shit gpu for a week for like 20$?
---
May or may not have called my Warlock Reviewbrah

Trying to figure out what the mods think is low effort is high effort

Probably doesn't have the savings or just had a major expense.

I played on an RP server in retail for many years and I very rarely saw RP in any global or world chat channels.  There were still people spamming "LF1M for UBRS, we have a key".  My experience with RP realms has been that the RPing happens mostly in private chat channels, /g chat, and with whispers.
---
I did really enjoy the RP server experience of people having unique and RP-sounding names.
---
Yea cause that makes sense
---
Where are the best mobs to farm linen if I'm a fresh Undead Priest?

Fine with blocking people are are legitimately toxic :)

I didn’t think there would be so much recoil to this post
---
Don't forget the bird shit on his head and the sweat band beard toupee thing he's got going on. Gotta say this dwarf kinda grosses me out. Sweet art though.
---
Yeah but if I'm not sweating through raids how else will I feed my E-go.
---
This time around we can tell David Carradine jokes.
---
you would think its that easy but it is frusturating for me to see people who brag about how awesome they are for getting down the heroic bosses down so easily while i am at the point where i am still trying to gear up for lfr for example.
---
Exactly specs and especially racial bonuses had a 0.1% affect on the raiding game if that.
---
You did not try very hard if you didn't find anything recent.  Search YouTube... wow classic... there's most likely a vid on professions in the last week or two.  Older ones also apply because we are about to play a 15 year old game with the same professions as before.  That being said... go with engineering at 60... don't need to right away while leveling but do that and watch a vid to pick what else you want.
---

---
Actually not too far from the truth
---
Layering is essentially a way to prevent massive server burnout from literally everyone being in the starting zones together. Blizzard has said with quite a lot of certainty that by phase 2 (a couple months in probably) that layering will be removed as the population has spread out over the world
---
Just take your time and enjoy it.  I figure I'll be around 8-12 days played to get to 60 myself.
---
I enjoyed that. Thank you.
---
Retail bullshitery?
---
Are people aware that Dire Maul and ZG were both intended as catch-up dungeons? And BG/pvp rewards helped supplement "pre-raid" gear fro groups struggling with progression?
---

Thanks! I enjoyed reading this.

This post sucks and you are dumb
---
Seeing that cinematic for the first time made me love dwarfs.  They have been my race of choice for a long time and I will proudly be playing a dwarf rogue tomorrow and on.
---
Dude you don't need 16GB of ram on a gaming rig... unless you're doing heavy Photoshop and shit, too. VRAM is *much* more important than system mem capacity. 8GB is fine and will save you ~$100.
---
Take that $100 and turn a GTX 1650 into a true GTX 2060 instead.
---
I jumped on last night and created an orc hunter in bfa which is my intended main for classic. My experience was: pick up a few quests, mini map covered in blue showing where to get pickups, heirloom gear available meant 3-shot killing everything to the point where I killed scorpions so fast I had trouble collecting their poison at first, got to 10 in an hour or less excited then remembered no talent points. Did a kill quest with some random who never said a word. Picked up alchemy and made some minor strength pots, went to gift to a local lowbie warrior through trade and blizzard so no because cross-realm. It just has no soul anymore. Classic can't be here soon enough.
---
They aren't. The meme refers to 30 year olds who act like their parents, the boomers.
---
It's meme.
---
A combination of medications depending on what you have access to may include a planned dossing of Adderall or Vyvanse in combination with Modafinil and a very high dose of caffeine. This would of course be done by people who are quite used to working 50+ hrs without sleep already.
---
If you are using this as reference and are highly inexperienced please do not attempt.
---
You can group up with others from level 1. On horde side the lowest level dungeon you can join is Ragefire Chasm and is so-able from around your mid-teens. But you can walk in with your group at much lower levels, it’ll just be harder.
---
Whatever you say Scarn!

[this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gLrmUgzzIxMExATvLdcjf60nHMwEKd4voWDTQB6JTcA/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0) is something I stole off a stream. It's a google spreadsheet of classic addons, and links to them.
---
Does context matter if you're going to do it anyway? There's never a choice as to the outcome of the quest, so why bother knowing why you're doing it? 
---
Questing is interesting in games where there's multiple endings, but in a game where they exist purely to fuel XP then who really cares? The buzzard asses will be collected whether we like it or not.
---
laughs in 26th
---
Blizz has said they will break this addon.
---
The problem is the games are the same in name only at this point. Some people like BFA and others like Classic, but designing the expac after BFA to be more like Classic is just going to piss off the people that like BFA.
---
It would be better to just keep the games separate and not have the design philosophy of one affect the other, like OSRS and RS3.
---
What is the best way to join people doing dungeons?
---
You keep saying they promised something. So far all they promised for the name reservations were the character creating so you can jump as soon as they open.
---
Long live American industrial food production!
---
are all those drugs other then the caffeine you mentioned legal. not to mention i can barely sometimes work 32 hours a week with some of the sleep i get. but i mean its not very consistant sometimes i am known to get 5 hours of sleep or take a nap for 2-3 hours once i get home.
---
It's not hard, but it's **harder** than clicking 3 buttons.
---
Are you using more than 1 action bar when you play?
---
are Mages or Rogues less gear dependant? Which class takes less time to get pvp ready at lv 60 ?
---
You can build a good premade whit any class. Sure there have been theory crafting done and some sort of optimal group have been decided upon but you can build groups to counter that setup from other classes and you can exchange classes inside the group
---
I tried but he's one. Gonna give him a couple years.

and no matter what you did that day, the day of name reservations, you wont have your name reserved on the new servers that open in a few hours

Very true

Learning will be obtained via errors during curiosity, you cannot learn if you aren't using free will to proceed along a path that is just yours, made up of your own steps. thats one of the amazing things of the experience of this game. you have to go to each location with your whole mind, and engage the process of thought to actualize yourself. it is amazing, i am ready to play.

You do know that Blizzard has stated that they aren’t going to allow these types of addons? They’re going to release a patch that changes the API to disallow LFG type addons.

    frame:SetScript("OnEvent", function (self, event)

**Jacaranda, University of Sydney**
---
The jacaranda was a historically significant specimen of Jacaranda mimosifolia tree that stood in the south-eastern corner of the University of Sydney main quadrangle, and now describes its clone replanted in the same location. It was first planted in 1928 by Associate Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, and replaced several times in the 1930s. Blooming in late spring at the end of the academic year, it became closely associated with examination time at the university. It has formed the background to many events, and the original tree was on the City of Sydney's Significant Tree Register.

Definitely not a big deal for warlock.  Drain tanking is a great way to level.   I played one in vanilla and barely used my wand until 60 for judgement of mana/light on some bosses.

No idea... they were probably using model viewers, machinima tools, or these screenshots came from Blizzard PR or partner invitations to visit Blizzard's HQ.

I never played Classic, I started during WoD. Classic is basically all new content for me, almost like playing an entirely new game. As someone who loved doing the Timewalking dungeons/raids as they came out, Classic definitely something that appeals to me.
---
I also like the idea of playing on a freshly created server with everyone starting from scratch, with no ability to purchase gold (through Wow Tokens) or level boosts. It'll be interesting to see how the economy evolves. Many items like herbs, leather and ore will have a huge demand, but no one will have any gold to buy it, particularly since people will be trying to save all their gold for a mount.

I'm sure he plays from another world :)

Is that why you all look depressed all the time?

I second this. You’ll be lucky to play anytime this week.

Quite a few quests since your underwater breath is WAY lower than in retail. Main one I know of is the murloc elite quest chain part in STV.
---
Definitely isn't an answer, but I will leave you with this advice.
---
Mining is a farming profession and in my 18 (fuck I'm getting old) years of playing online games from d2 wow (and several of the expansions) to eve, albion and many more. I've never seen a game where farming was even remotely as profitable as either trading or crafting in terms of money made per time invested, there's with few exceptions money to be made with whatever profession or trade skill or whatever they're called in the different games, and should that fail buying low and selling high has never failed me.
---
The money is there, just gotta find them and the majority of the players don't want to put in 15 minutes of work for nothing 9 times to make 1500g on the 10th, they'd rather go out and farm 1000g in those 2.5 hours because that way they don't feel like they're wasting there time when it doesn't work out, that's what you need to capitalize on, players being lazy.
---
They promised name reservations, and its the opposite of what you get if you decide to play on the new servers (that are opened before launch)
---
Would you rather they just kept the amount of servers they had from the start. Making it so you wouldn't be able to play untill after you have waited for hours?
---
I like the “weighs over 40lbs” part. 💪🏼
---
you got it bud! Keep it classic you casual scum!

Just Google Classic Wow Instance guide. There's plenty of online resources.

I mean if you have never heard of things like Adderall and Vyvanse, then I really think this conversation is at an end. Quick google searches and common sense will answer any remaining questions you have.

Sad to hear about you 2080, but I can get ~30 FPS with mixed low/med/high settings on my Haswell laptop ( i5 4310U, HD 4400) playing WotLK on private servers while running the game through Wine. I think you'll get along fine with the iGPU of your 6700K until you RMA/get a new GPU.
---
get claw 2 or 3 and dont worry about it after that. claw is great for proccing frenzy but is bad damage
---
Well that's an incredibly short sighted and ignorant take on the world rofl
---
Not sure who's the biggest idiot, you or him.
---
For me WoW didn't die until the end of MoP. The content drought, raid finder etc.
---
Its worth mentioning that class design and class fantasy was at an all time high in MoP. The class design has never been and will likely never be as good as it was back then.
---
Dwarf has Stoneform which can be clutch in removing rogue poisons (including Blind!) which is very good in PvP.

NE can turn invisible while they're not fighting, allowing for ambushes / remaining safe if somebody runs by you.

I always rush Consecration and having no push back when using concentration aura on your healing spells is very nice for leveling

There are lists all over the internet. Alliance also has a low level dungeon but I can’t remember it’s level range.

Id rather play the game im paying for and not watch a queue

I also paid for a name reservation and I want that.  I'm just someone who wants to get what I'm paying for
---
Where is one for the mage damn it?
---
No, apparently you forget there is a limited amount of world quests that award azerite power and also azerite power exists lol. Having neck level 65 right now is a good advantage in PvP, m+, and raiding. If I don’t farm that ap every day ( like I haven’t been because it’s awful ) I won’t have that 65 neck like people do. It’s harder to achieve my goals without that second minor trait believe it or not. That’s not really the case in Classic. You also miss out on il increase of 445 azerite gear. I absolutely feel like I’m behind because others have a level 65 neck from grinding constantly everyday while I’m not. There isn’t a mechanic like that in Classic.
---
Pretty sure this is 3rd grade level.  You might want to get hooked on phonics
---
Oh yes you can.
---
They've had systems in place for the last decade that tracks this stuff. If your IP was here, and then suddenly it's across the world in China...then oh suddenly it's back in Los Angeles...doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what's going on.
---
I actually wonder why we aren't seeing Chinese leveling services spam everyone like crazy with this launch incoming...
---
Incredible!

\-1 for dwarf though.  Troll all the way ;D

Just kidding, it's a great painting!
---
It be like that
---
people only hear what they want to hear, we can't explain it. i see that your post is expressing the importance of everyone's own free will to drive the experience forward. excellent thought. That's how learning happens, with the initiative of individual curiosity. they are gonna combine that with resources and opinions as they go, if they intend to play the game with existing knowledge and not do redundant math and work on their own.

Oh I didn't see it there.  I thought maybe it was OC-guy posting his two halves.
---
it would be awesome to see a breakdown like this by phase
---
Hot take: Diablo Immortal releases the same time as Classic so you have something to do while waiting in queue.
---
LF2M = Looking for 2 more DPS
---
LFG = Looking for group
---
Vc is Van’cleaf ( What ppl called Deadmines for some reason)
---
Is anyone going to be around when the new servers open up tomorrow? My group is planning to use Incendius  as a backup in case we can't get on Whitemane, but I won't be around when it goes up and was looking for someone to reserve a name and get with me later in the day (before the game actually goes live) so I can grab it? 
---
Would be greatly appreciated!
---
Correct! My group is rolling warrior, priest, rogue, druid or mage and me the lock. I can’t wait! I loved playing private vanilla servers and glad they are releasing this.
---
I agree, except for Sekiro being janky! It was polished as heck, great game.
---
There are plenty of examples of popular early access games that are janky as fuck tho.
---
Because you couldn't shake the feel of private servers being kind of pointless?
---
that's... not how time works
---
You can always buy a toaster from walmart ;)
---
I think all of us can relate to this video
---
Wahhhhhhhh
---
I have 2 toddlers this time, so maybe that's why I feel the same. I'm going to have fun but as you say, being a mum comes first.
---
It’s not built in. There’s an addon for it though.
---
Don't you mean...Red Snappah?

---
You can literally see the wood grain on the head.
---
ITS ABSOLUTELY YUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
---
This is fine
---
I believe many people use twitch now.  Since I only plan on using 1 or 2 addons I will just do it manually by unzipping the addon into the WoW &gt; classic &gt; Interface &gt; AddOns directory (something like this &gt; C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns)
---
I think the wow forums has a thread for this. I'd recommend checking there too if you haven't
---
I would take both TBC and WOTLK right now. I wont be playing many more video games with a little one coming so I'll have to settle for classic.
---
Like what you see?
---
i’m wondering the same. i already have a lot of adding installed to retail wow via minion. will the ones that work with classic automatically carry over?
---
is that a yes or a no?
---
very original....
---
Get some fruit and veggies in that mix
---
I hope you put that ice cream back in the freezer. Also good choice
---
I'd be fine if they went up to WOLK.
---
Servers just opened? Hold my syringe ;P
---
YOU THINK YOU DO...
---
thats paint...
---
I’m honestly surprised there isn’t one yet.  A threat meter is the only addon actually needed to raid in Classic, but it seems like it’s the only thing nobody has bothered to make yet.
---
LFG - Looking for group (add class, level, role)
---
LF2M - Looking for 2 more (add what role, level, even classes you want/need)
---
VC - Vancleef
---
Bigglesworth when it drops! Hopefully I get the names I want!
---
They should totally bring this back. Hell bring back all of the original website.
---
Not if you consider that it costs 100/g per time you want to respec for fun(because it's 50g both ways, and if you raid once per week but also want to pvp in the week it's 100g per week minimum), so you'd actually save 200g overall if you invested in dual spec, and it would still be a meaningful gold sink.
---
Didn't Blizzard do one as well back then?
---
Oh I wouldn't put it past those guys to do shift work right there in the basement. One guy does his 3pm-3am shift, next guy takes over.
---
I guarantee you my figures will be on the conservative side.
---
Yep because vent suncream speak had 1000's of players in one server with bots that do automated LFG groups
---
i forgot i had it, and then uninstalled it
---
also i never bought BFA
---
The best one of these - https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/862/494/07a.png
---
It’s an “I ain’t reading that shit”

You’re only further proving his point.

Nobody loves BfA, it's truly a shitty game

Exactly this. I did enough of all of this endgame content back in they day. Looking forward to leveling with a different faction and making friends. AKA, what made the original great.

Change download path to Classic -&gt; Interface -&gt; Addons.

Find compatible addons, press download.

Otherwise, go here and manually put them into your addons folder https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/

Releasing a Tbc server would split the playerbase.

I tend to think we're all on these reddit boards with our desire to make Azeroth great again, but to each their own.
---
I didn’t realise how much I needed to see this until now. Thank you for sharing this
---
I understand the sentiment, and I see how some of us take that approach amongst all this hype but I still can’t see the need for four of these during a single weekend. Never before have I seen a community talk more about how some of us are going to die before our game releases than this one. It came across as weird to me, like what’s the point in repeating this?
---
" After careful examination, we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it. "

Awesome. Thanks for the reply!

My dream game is wow adopting wildstar’s combat system. Wow’s is, indeed, outdated in the sense that better systems are developed. Still, Classic deserves to be played, not because it’s best, but because it’s fun.

I love you

Where my homies jumping on Bigglesworth
---
So I just subbed. Is the client for release available for pre download yet? If so, how do I get it? 
---
Do I need to do the "world of warcraft" download under "downloads, blizzard"? or is that just the current retail client?
---
Don't forget to weave auto attacks in between gcds
---
Choo choo!
---
I don't see how classic is supposed to make people wanna play retail if they are 2 different games. I mean there is a reason they were bleeding out of subs.
---

Limiting it, is essentially breaking it. Please go play bfa.

I never 'Literally fell through the world' in Sekiro, which does put it above a good 90% of the games I've played in the last year or so.

Classic is way more casual than BfA. If you take 2 weeks off in BfA you come back with a gap in your AP and missing 2 chests worth of gear and you basically suck and the game has punished you.
---
Take two weeks off of classic? Who cares? Right back to it.

Only game! Too many games just add crafting in as an additional function. FFXIV has actual rotations for crafting high level items. It's not just gather the mats and make an item.
---
Very smart. I will likely end up helping the homies, honestly. I can't have my squad lagging behind on their pegs.
---
I think it's definitely worth a shot for $30.
---
So you're planning on being the first classic wow casualty?
---
I know it’s a joke but this is a big yikes.
---
I haven’t played since Wrath of the Lich King and have no desire to play anything but Classic
---
They already said no.
---
Believe me, I feel you. I am all about the fair fight.
---
But to be completely honest with you, if I'm out to do "fair fighting" then I'd have to play fighting games or competitive strategy games where the environment is at least attempted to be fair.
---
Here in Classic WoW hoo boy I too felt the rage of being ganked by a dastardly rogue and I've nearly punched my desk. But after having lived on a PvP server, going back to a PvE one sure felt strange. Like the rush was gone.
---
thanks that seems to have fixed it!
---
Time to pass The Cold Hand to hunters for meme value
---
The fact that Azeroth starts with an "A," and that a campaign slogan was stolen to show how we feel for WoW....not really thinking that's political.  I would think that be useful for people on any side of the fence.  
---
Again, you're trying to make things political when they most likely aren't.  As a priest, I'd ask you to heal thyself from the disease of making everything political, as my cure disease spell can't help that.
---
&gt;  Furthering this stigma that paladins shamans and druids are crap for XY content is an ancient meme stemming from vanilla. 
---
so are you really going to say that paladins are viable end game dps on a par with mages, wars and rogues? Or Shamans for that matter?
---
It isn't a "meme", it is based on the limitations of the class.
---
Play what you want, for sure, but it is silly to deny reality, even if denying reality is a trope of the current era.
---
NARRATOR:  It won't help him.

Is there a way to make it just focused on Darnassus rep?

I had my 10 year old play WoW for a bit, but she didn’t really take to it, and I’m not about to make her play, lol. She’s into Roblocks or some game

Thanks!

i can already see that.

Yea its my first time rolling tauren and , I agree, I would like to experience Mulgore. Might just have to kodo up.
---
On stress test you were able to pick pocket mobs already in combat with someone. Didn't matter if it was a grouped person who tagged it or not.
---
Will  /dance still suffice if much lower level?
---
Solid group comp! I hope my buddy decides to roll a mage.
---
Remindme! 10 hours
---
I feel like we could use the train meme with a bleeding tunnel.
---
this is going to be first time playing wow in general. should i play on a pvp server
---
I bought one of those and still have it, it works wonders.
---
I’m assuming this in on PC and not the mobile app?
---
If you chose that face, you‘re a crackhead
---
I had 3 on Herold but ended up making 2 in Sekram instead.
---
It reminded me of the Cloisters before the Catacombs in Diablo 2
---
I urge all Warlocks to fully utilise Enslave Demon because it's hilarious.
---
retail is going to mobile.
---
There's a lot of tedium involved in the life of a vanilla / classic hunter. Also, they drop off so badly in DPS after tier 1. They're basically tranq bots in later raids: guilds tend to bring as few as possible.
---
have u heard those groups who think they are going to do ANYTHIGN in MC by the 2nd week?  
---
Its gonna take a while for level up and more whiles to attune and gain progress in the level 60 content
---
This one literally just parses chat. I hope they don’t break that feature, because a ton of other addons rely on that functionality.
---
You know you’re a crotchety old person when you use the phrase “kids these days.”
---
i quess those people are with their kids 24/7, personally i dont understand, when i was a kid i was either with friends or playing games, and my parents would watch the tv, they could have just aswell played wow. but those people also think you need to play 10+ hours a day to do endgame in classic. to any1 who doesnt have much time, roll holy paladin, its the least effort you need to put in mainly because of the lack of consumables.
---
im not installing any at least the first day. I dont want any to bug out and cause me to relog to fix it.
---
You couldn't have picked a better race for your class, gnomes have a great intelligence bonus.  
---
Remember you can't take many hits.  Don't agro more than one enemy at a time.  You're a damage dealing powerhouse though, you'll have an easy time getting in dungeon groups, especially after you learn Sheep.
---
If it was a discussion topic it would've been marked 'low effort meme'.
---
Wasnt me :o
---
How does one create a guild in classic and how much does it cost
---
legit. where can i get one?
---
Looking forward to seeing you! ;)
---
Fairbanks alliance here, hope it's a good server!
---
Riiight! It would be pretty cool, unfortunately I have no idea what they plan to do in the coming years.
---
Really not sure how much I enjoy academia after my undergrad. At least I got classic. And by the time I'm finished it'll not be that many phases in.
---
Guaranteed someone had a bot running to grab that name. Bummer bro
---
I was reading online some people saying around 46ish if you do the Nelf quests area starting early on. Maybe that was for later patches. I'm rolling lock so I'll get free mount 40 and then looking towards level 60 mount for tiger so have time. No stranger to the long runs from Vanilla, just can't remember if there was a shortcut. Thanks for the advice!
---
They already said maintenance won’t happen on Classic unless necessary.  Spoiler: it’ll be necessary
---
Are you telling me you have succesfully figured out classic wow is not a sustainable business model from your dark mancave with some detective work and blizzard is making a mistake here? Damn i will give a recommendation to blizz about you. They rly need your assistance my friend
---
Why is it only my views? I dont remember nost, elysium, lights-hope, kronos dying because the player didnt like the classic experience and dropped out after they noticed how hard it is to level. Actually they thrived for years. 
---
Blizzard isnt doing this for the lols either. They have seen the private server activity. They literally shut down nost because it was out of control.
---
The classic servers will have less of a % drop than any of the past 5 retail addons ever had. We have proof of that from private server and retail server activity. Yes. the players dont have 100% accurate numbers of that activity but we can see the drop in forum activity, easiest example would be the subscriber drop of the subreddits. Its clear numbers and that numbers dont shine bright on retail. I dont think blizz randomly decided to drop classic wow with the chancec of the whole thing dying off after 3 month.....
---
No Unbreakable 😱
---
Mages are kiters. A good way to counter them is to deny their ability to do so. EA as a mage is invaluable.

Dual spec cost 1000 gold in wrath.  I'd be okay if it cost the same in vanilla.

---
&gt;leatrix
---
I've tried "lazy pig" in the past, I prefer a more leightweight/neater option. The key elements for an addon like this is obviously dismount, but also; stand-up when casting, leave  e.g. shadowform when casting healing spells.. pfUI had all this, and more built in. 
---
Good tip by the way. :)
---
Makes sense.  I'll be playing with my cousin so as long as we are both on the same page I'm going to be an auctionhouse ho.
---
that looks wicked!
---
I understand you don't need the whole 40-man stack to do Molten Core, you can get by just fine with much less as long as everyone's on their A-game and they've all done this a billion times before.
---
And I'm sure they'll be in the hardest of hardcore guilds, taking 2 weeks off work to race to 60, all of them. Buuuuuut I'm just gonna say, they'll be the exception not the norm, or at least that's what I believe.
---
Just a wild guess but I think the userbase who'll be coming to WoW Classic will be on average an older crowd. We'll see.
---
Nothing wrong with leveling two classes, especially if one is a healer. There really are roses to smell on the way, so take your time.
---
I remember apps, too. I took my raiding pretty seriously in wrath, and started looking for a new guild. I knew I had what it took, i just needed someone to take a chance and see if i fit in well. 
---
I found what i was looking for eventually, but the process along the way was a pain in the ass. A lot of guilds took applications, membership, loyalty really seriously. Sometimes too seriously.
---
Why would you not want a retail tank? 
---
Assuming they were doing mythic content, they'll be over qualified to running dungeons in Classic.
---
Hell, even your average shitty retail tank will be better than Vanilla tanks back then.
---
You're trash Brock
---
Anyone have a rogue cheat sheet? Specifically a horde side?
---
ElvUI should have the "one giant bag" thing built in (it does on retail). 
---
Details! has a classic version.  Basically identical to Recount, but a bit better in some minor ways.
---
Cannon fodder, azeroth is a dog eat dog world. They will learn - the hard way, or they will leave, either way so be it. War is coming and red means dead so watch your back boys and girls.

He said i cheated that i wasn't supposed to use any spells.

Warriors are better, but even most raid bosses can be tanked by a druid.

Shoot, you can not only play but contribute to guilds. Even if your collecting herbs for your guilds potions.
---
But if they die itll only reduce the que times so go hard my dudes
---
You only have a limited number of macro slots.
---
Upvoted until I realized you were Alliance scum!
---
God damn that Ironforge painting though
---
Just play the game and you’ll find friends and groups to play with.
---
I just built a PC using an AMD APU with (extra good) on-board graphics and it runs retail at 8/10 with good frame rate. I’m expecting to run classic at high settings with a $500 CAD build. You’ll be fine!
---
I'll take that thank you very much
---
No aUtHeNtIcItY allowed on the InTeRnEt fam
---
Most will end up back in retail eventually.
---
I sure hope so
---
Just personal preference, I just don't click with private servers like I would the official thing. The balance is usually off, server life is up in the air. Idk, just not my thing.
---
There's a LOT more bad stuff in TBC that you didn't mention.  They would have to change a LOT about TBC in order to make it more like classic in terms of gameplay.  It would be much easier to just take Classic and add content/change a few things balancewise.
---
Sheesh I thought I was the only one here.. I can't even imagine eating anything in that photo even if someone paid me.

Ya looks like it's BiS for mages until enigma (phase 5). Bloodvine is BoE though so it might not be worth holding onto tailoring for all those phases after you've crafted your archmage robes.

ANOTHER POST ON THIS TOPIC WAS NECESSARY
---
Still 20 hours to go my dude
---
Disclaimer, I'm also a WoW novice so I have no insights into the actual play.
---
But if money isn't tight, then I would say drop 15$ on it and try it. It's a pretty rare experience to start a community game at the same time as everyone else. Especially a game as big as WoW is.

I’ll play for 3-4 hours on Tuesday when hopefully I can complete some quests....

I have a family now, so I only will be playing about 3-4 hours a week
---
I've been curious on what the experience was really like for these other full-loot PvP titles.
---
Did it end up where people who stash all their best gear into the bank, and only pull it out for big events and such? It feels awful to be surrounded by a nude mob that all take turns punching you to death to rob all your gear.
---
Damnit!  Ugh.
---
Find the server Discord.
---
Those fresh fruits won't last beyond level 40.
---
It’s 15$ to try it for one month.
---
I was just pointing out to the original commenter. I would take fruits over candy and baked goods any day but I gotta as just pointing out the sugar content in a lot of fruits is pretty damn high. It’s like saying I’m drinking this iced tea with natural sweeteners over my dew when in fact that so called “healthy” tea may have just as much or even more sugar content.
---
don't forget that your progression is reset every few months due to constant catch up mechanics. so you do achieve something and suddenly you're back at square one.
---
That would be big, if true.
---
If you get all of the quests for each one, they are all worth it (minus DM and stockades of course) just use a site like classicdb or something and go through the dungeon quests to make sure you get them all for your faction.
---
Don't listen to the guy who said skip RFC and Gnomer, RFC has good quest xp and item rewards, and gnomer has some INSANE leather agi pants from a quest.
---
The answer is probably no because it would involve manipulating game files which is a bannable offense

They can either continue classic or lose a sub from many people including myself.  I'm sorry but I'm not going to play consistently for 2 years just to have that 2 years of progress go down the drain with a TBC:classic release.  
---
I would however most likely maintain a sub for a really fucking long time if they did Classic+ so my progress  meant something more.

anyone got an idea what the CHEAPEST laptop I can find that can run classic to an acceptable degree? I checked the requirements ofc, an intel core 2, a geforce 8800 and 2gb ram. Seems simple enough, except the requirements for a card are a killer. I can't find anything under £650 which is way out of budget. I found [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FF9PY8Y/ref=dp\_cerb\_1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FF9PY8Y/ref=dp_cerb_1) but thats using an intel uhd 620. From a review online: In our tests, the UHD 620 is most suited for casual games like Team Fortress 2, Rocket League or Farming Simulator 17.  So is that enough? its still probably over budget too. I just need a toaster really, doesnt have to be high end just able to play.

Some people just don’t get time zones. Had a friend in high school that just didn’t get it. He couldn’t comprehend that it wasn’t always day everywhere at the same time. He also thought when weather was global. Meaning he thought if it was snowing for us in Canada in January, it was snowing everywhere at the same time.

Everyone is viable enough. I played shaman back in the day and it was all pretty fun. It’s more about the people you know than your skills and viability unless you’re in a competitive environment.

I'm running on a Dell Optiplex 7010 as well, actually. The CPU will not be bottlenecking you. I also have a GTX 970, and will be playing on absolute max settings and streaming it. You didnt list the specific graphics card, nor ram, so I can't gurantee you'll be able to do the same, but you should be absolutely fine to play.

Only Tauren have a unique hitbox. Gnomes have the same as everyone else.

Same here.  *stares into distance*

honestly I would sell the cloth for the first 5 days. It will make you way more and guarantee you get your mount. You can farm it back (stockades, open world) alot easier when your higher/max level, or buy it once the supply has become larger and prices have fallen, combined with you being richer cos your farming at 60.

We don't know the full effect it will have really. Some early worries included abusing layer changing to gathering materials, but there is a cooldown on jumping layers thats as long as most material respawns.
---
There were videos of people being forced onto other layers mid combat, or every time they entered ogrimmar they jumped to an empty layer, but they are bugs that have been fixed.
---
And stress test had different caps on the population per layer, so we have no real idea what it will be like until tomorrow.
---
The issue is being overblown honestly.
---
Combination of time zone, rule set, population, community, and where my real life friends are going. Lots of variables.
---
For me it's gonna be Grobbulus most likely. Pacific time zone, RP-PvP (I used to RP, plus I prefer PvP servers), solid population but not too many people, great community so far, and 3 of my IRL friends are playing there.

At 60 literally everything you sent to your alt will be vendors anyways because you dont need it.

I’ve played on and off since vanilla, and I’m very excited for the way the raids are set up in vanilla. I’m just a little bit worried that everybody who is super excited to play classic and progress, and eventually raid are going to realize what all that takes, and will burn out, leaving us with a very small dedicated population.
---
Haha this is great!!! Good luck hope you can get it again!
---
Oh no! This reminds me I totally forgot to stock up on CHEEZ ITS! I went down the chip aisle and forgot to go down the cracker aisle D:   Thank you for your kind service, I'll have just enough time after work to grab some before launch  \^-\^
---
Back when they first played it they were teenagers/young adults who could dedicate 100% of their time to it and play hardcore and it developed a culture where that was seen as the only way to play. It's not true of course and you can even ask the original devs who they designed the game for and their answer has always been for hardcore and casual players alike.
---
Aha thank you .
---
You realize wow classic is the main game now right?  Retail is dead.  It will fade into obscurity releasing the occasional expansion to remain relevant.  But it will always be classic from now on that carries the genre.
---
Mages are less gear dependent than Rogues. Everything is gimpy in bad gear tho.
---
Possibly. I haven't tried it out on the PTR, but I remember it from when it was first introduced. I'd go to mine something, pick a herb, kill a mob, etc, and it would suddenly disappear on me. Took a while to figure out that an invisible player got there first.
---
Concurrent subscriptions are really the only objective way to determine WoW's "peak".
---
I'm sure your opinion will be popular here but it's far from factual. 
---
Love it or hate it, wotlk was the peak.
---
Ya the horde sucks!  Hillsbrad Foothills is the first contested area and I want to show you the ropes. So after you make your super intimidating and badass gnome come to Tauren M--- I mean South Shore and I will personally hang out with you all day to give you an authentic classic PvP experience.

Do not play any class with a heal button if you want to dps, especially shaman. Their healing specs are the worst in the game. Whoever told you that is trolling you and not to be trusted.

no they did not

I think it's a tossup. 25% stun resistance is probably better for PVP, but Will of the Forsaken isn't without its benefits.

---
Reddit tends to be where people go for *"content"* -- not answering questions or helping out. I'd recommend joining server discord or community discord if you have specific questions you'd like answered. Unfortunately, this isn't the best platform for anything not meme related.
---
We don't know if these bugs have fixed, just that the devs have stated that they are. If I had a nickel for every time a developer fixed a bug and it didn't fix it....

Yeah weeds the pussies and the masocists out from each other right out the gate.

&gt; Im thinking Stoneform will do me better levelling on a PVP server

This probably won't hold true. As far as leveling and open world PvP, shadowmeld is king. Stoneform is really useful in BGs, and some Duel matchups.

It’s very likely that you could import the new models into the Classic client the same way you did in private, but I strongly advise against it. Blizzard not so long ago banned a lot of people because they modified armor textures on retail. The best you can do is wait and hope the developers adds an option for the new models into the game.

Then I'd miss actually classic wow content.

&gt;They don't care about making money? wut
---
They care about profit.
---
Increasing sub numbers would make more money, but it wouldn't guarantee more profit.
---
Classic+ *might* maintain the playerbase, and it *might* bring in new and older players.
---
It will definitely require more costs for development. It's a riskier investment than just cutting expenses and depending on loyalty. 
---
If their handling of Diablo, starcraft, and HotS is anything to go by, they'd much rather cut costs to increase their profit margin, rather than invest more into making a quality product and hoping it pays off.

I'll make sure to stay away from them. Thanks for the heads up

Personally I just don't want to see people complaining that vanilla doesn't have, or should have, this that and the other thing. It's perfectly fine to ask questions and hopefully people are going to be helpful, just understand that you're going to be playing a game that came out 15 years ago and it's not even close to the retail version.
---
I was thinking more regards to when you’ve been attacked? In that case isn’t shadowmeld void ?
---
Can I have that hat please?
---
it's always been my experience that these folks only respond to direct replies to their hurtful comments
---
For me, zone levelling was way more interesting than dungeon finder levelling because it just felt more like a traditional RPG. Dungeon finder levelling felt super depressing because I knew there was this whole world out there I should be playing in, but then when I went to zone level I'd be alone in an abandoned wasteland. 
---
If all you care about is endgame content, I legitimately don't think you'll find classic fun because classics endgame content is mostly interesting in the context of the work it takes to get there. Retail blizzard is mostly about skipping to the end and playing the game that's set up there.
---
Not to mention the damn rep grinds to get your flying mounts. It's drip fed and dictated by Blizzard as to exactly how much rep you can gain per day. I maxed out all reps except the 2 new one and I just can't do it anymore. Bring on Classic!

Holy smokes this talk of guild loyalty brings back memories.

During Burning Crusade era, I was in a very small guild...just a handful of us who knew each other in real life. This meant that being able to cobble the numbers together to do a 10-man was a big deal.
---
So just imagine when someone who joined the guild a few months ago announced he was leaving us for another(our progression wasn't so hot, partly being comprised of families with kids and so forth). The level of outage and feelings of betrayal that raged over Ventrilo was crazy.
---
To this day I couldn't believe that the young man just sat there, and took it. He could have left, never to be seen again. But no. He stayed on the chat channel, and *took* all the verbal abuse heaped on him.
---
Cheers, out of intrigue what happens if it gets sent back, does it gain a new timer of 30 days or its lost for ever?

Not sure if you’re both trolling or just the other guy but all you need is a wow subscription. Servers open up for login tomorrow at 6pm eastern time. They are open now to reserve up to 3 names but you can’t log into the characters.

Hael yea!
---
Classic still has a limited life cycle. Even if it does continue to gain subs as the phases go on, it will lose them after everyone gets their fill of phase 6 since that is the end of the content unless Blizzard 180's on their decision to do Classic+, but then that wouldn't be vanilla anymore. 
---
And yeah, Vanilla did continue to gain subs. But again, it was because it came out at the right time and place in the market. To expect that Blizzard is going to capture lightning in a bottle a second time is simply delusional. Especially with the same game and in an era where people don't have for the kind of time commitment Vanilla took. It will still be popular for what it is, and that is the only reason why Blizzard gave in. They know it isn't going to be the second coming of MMOs, but they have seen that there are still enough fans to at least make it profitable.

Gatekeeping happens in pretty much any community or hobby lol. I'm not sure if there's any one reason you can pinpoint for why people do it. For classic specifically I'd say a lot of gatekeeping comes from a defensive attitude toward anyone who they perceive may try to affect the "classic experience" they've been vying for for so long.

Lol it did cost a lot, but theyre my favorite mogs in the game by far. Luckly also got tusks in like 66 runs as well.

Mage is pretty fun. Useful in 5-man dungeons, you can level either single target or AoE if you'd like. Even when leveling, you can swap to fire for some meaty damage, or frost for some nice efficient damage and control. Druid is fun, though it has it's drawbacks, even when leveling. They're efficient but I really don't enjoy playing as a kitty. Stealth is a blessing though on any PVP server. Warlocks are hella fun too, and like mages, theyre always needed.

---
So like. The main player base for vanilla wasn't a zoomer or a Boomer.
---
The media thinks for you. Sad.
---
It's not just mana. They cannot use Storm strike or shocks in raids because that would knock off a useful debuff, so all they can do is auto attack. They also scale poorly with gear, and the gear isn't really itemized well.
---
They struggle to beat tank dps.
---
Nah he can just use the garbage tier hat.
---
Eh, Luna Unit frames would be affected. Some popular combat logs also use chat channels to share information inside a raid/group. Guild addons do as well. The most popular RP addon does.  
---
I think people don’t realize that some of their favorite addons would be negatively impacted because they don’t understand how the fully work.
---
have fun with all the down time from cleaning your greasy ass fingers...
---
yall dont think clearly about your food choices do you
---
Grobuluss will be emerald dream. High/medium. Not a server that will have issues with population
---
I wouldn't say zero - if you're on a pvp server there will be lots of people in tier gear ganking you.
---
&gt; we're probably looking at ~2 months before BGs,
---
BGs is phase 3. I would bet 2 months just for phase 2.
---
If we want to go off the "average" player, its will take them roughly 11 days /played to hit 60. With 3 hours a day, thats about 3 months.
---
The retail quests are more streamlined but it feels the same but more jank, you will see tomorrow.
---
Because gold grinders don’t play the game; their only purpose is gold generation, and it’s borderline prison labour (apparently not so borderline as I’ve read articles about Chinese prisoners actually being forced to grind gold).
---
Yes, it’s technically “real” gold. No, nobody but a gold seller will play the game that way. You pay to play the game; earning money is part of the game. If you buy gold, fucking forget you bud. I’d never play with a known gold buyer. You’re making my server worse, and punishing every casual. If it’s just people playing the right way to make gold fast, that’s one thing. When it’s literally just someone no-lifeing to make a few yuan, that is against the TOS for a very clear (and I thought *fucking obvious*) reason.
---
If these casuals never played an old school MMO they can't fathom how casual WOW really was at its launch.
---
What type of damage does life steal enchant so in 1.12?  Is it still fire?
---
It doesn't though. Most private servers are "dead".
---
Honestly, you might be entirely right.

Night Elf. Never really played one extensively in my 14 years of WoW, and no specific plans to level one in Classic. Maybe it's the floppy ears, maybe its the blue-green skin. Maybe it's the reputation they have for being bad...
---

Stormpike Bowman Rank 7. Vanndar Stormpike rank 25.

That bridge of death.
---
The same as retail. What is the retail limit? Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to that
---
I guess I noticed it more here because people are very very vocal. 
---
I’m going to play both. Classic will be a good filler for when retail is slow. I’m not sure why some insist it has to be “us vs them”.
---
I just bought the [G502 lightspeed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_i_vS0yDb98YVARZ) , so far so good. We’ll see how it plays tomorrow.  I never liked the mice with 20 small buttons all grouped together.  My fat thumbs hit to many buttons at once.
---
What is better Fury or Arms? Planning to play warrior but idk what spec.
---
Fort Waynian number four here!
---
Completely different. I’m envious of your new journey to 60.
---
it's a fucking video game, being relatively healthy isnt that hard
---
I'm playing a rogue so realistically I'll see you, follow you in stealth, wait until you are low health and fighting a mob then gank you for an easy kill.

Yeah. . .

Even if it was prostitution, nobody should give a shit about what consenting adults do with their bodies behind closed doors.  It’s judgey puritanical bullshit.

Damn GrobbMobb making the final push towards the top. It was medium earlier this morning when I checked. Let’s see how this goes.
---
Are you kidding me? If you are arguing that the semantics of piracy and theft are different, then yes you are correct. If you are arguing that piracy is not stealing/a crime, then you are incredibly wrong. Piracy is most definitely a crime, one that the FBI has [a nice page](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime/piracy-ip-theft) of describing exactly that.
---
&gt; But if you take a year to get to 60 on your main, you may miss the big raid push
---
There will be others who decide to go back and play alts, or who come a little late to the game from retail or elsewhere when their friends finally pull them in. There will always be guilds for relatively fresh lvl 60s.
---
Daggers is definitely good in pve. Corehound gloves + daggers is pretty great way to go for a lot of warrior races. Axes are so relatively uncommon/low quality you'll see plenty of orc dagger warriors for instance. Weapon skill is pretty huge, since it negates the 1% hit penalty usually encountered with +hit.

Nothing wrong with playing WoW on a laptop. A skinless potato running on 2 half empty AAA Duracell batteries can get 60 fps in this 16 year old game
---
the hype is real, havent played since Cata.
---
Blizz does, though. The lead devs of Classic have been on his podcast multiple times, and they have a "community" team whose job it is to give more than two fucks about them.
---
Yikes. The suggestive rape is strong in this one.

A chrome book is not a laptop it's a tablet with a keyboard. Battle net is not compatible with chrome books.

It wasn't in vanilla so it's very doubtful.

You think patchwerk would be higher than Vael if more people had raised Naxx?
---
dude..they take it super serious and its filled with cringe.
---
I need to go to bed and now I can’t because of this. I can’t believe you have done this to me.
---
In phase one while leveling I'll leave alliance alone unless they start things with me, or I've seen them causing trouble before.
---
In phase 2 and beyond... If it's red it's dead!
---
Any recommendations for professions for locks? I’m currently thinking tailoring and enchanting
---
Don't listen to the "nochanges" people replying to this. They're either trying to get a rise out of you, or their viewpoint is wildly naive. All of them are perfectly fine with updated world textures, resolution capabilities, dynamic shadows, water effects, etc., but act like the world is ending when someone states that they prefer the new models to the old ones. It's childish, and ignorant.
---
That being said, there are lots of issues with new player models. Unfortunately, new character animations and other features were baked into the update(s) that brought the new player/NPC models, so it's a more complicated procedure for the devs than simply just replacing them on client side. All you can do at this point is hope that Blizzard recognizes that part of their playerbase is interested in seeing the new models implemented at some point, and considers adding a toggle feature or something. Hope this helps.
---
I find it astonishing that none of the replies have mentioned that you can skip the level grind in retail, *and* that you can do so for free with the expansion. *(Minus ten levels, but I'm sure 120 boosts will be later this year or early next year.)*

You're conflating a desire for instant gratification with a casual gameplay style. Additionally, assuming that a casual player is just someone who can only dedicate a very small amount of time to the game. If those two things describe you then yes classic isn't for you, you're far beyond just a normal casual player and retail is made for you.
---
I also meal pepper actual food (:

you didn’t even ask a question, what is there for us to answer?

And here's the gatekeeping mentioned in a comment further up!
---
When playing the stress test I noticed how much more chill classic WoW was vs retail. The pace of classic is a lot slower, meaning that you do not have a constant urge to level up and get better get. Just log on, do what you want, maybe mentally check out while you grind and then log off when you feel you had enough. It is a much better after work activity than retail WoW, which is constant gogogo. I feel more stressed out than anything when I am done with a retail WoW play session.
---
You will meet people! Be open and friendly and you may build friendships that will last a lifetime.
---
Op
---
RP servers just tend to be slightly more chill and polite than ordinary servers. Maybe 10-15% of the population ardently RPs, and it's like getting bonus colorful NPCs in every major city. Everyone else just plays the game as normal.
---
Battlegrounds are the only "fair" PvP and they are just as available on a PvE server.
---

Yeah, there were issues with the BFA launch for some, and yet virtually every streamer was live, Method got the world-first 120, and all but one person I know got in without issues (but the one had hella issues).
---
Compared to the original launch, I'd say they learned a lot. And this is going to be another 3pm west coast launch, just like BFA, with a smaller playerbase, so I'm expecting it to be better than BFA.
---
But we'll see.
---
If I’m not outnumbered I will.

Playing on my old account on my old PC from 2005
---
Kind of just made these over time but here’s a breakdown:
---
- Breakfast burritos (6): 3 Potatoes (oven), Pack of Bacon (oven), 12 Eggs, Salsa
---
- BBQ Chicken (5): Chicken breast marinaded in BBQ sauce for 24 hours, Israeli couscous, Arugula, Cheney Tomatoes, Mediterranean dressing
---
- Teriyaki Pork (5); 2 Pork Loin marinaded in Teriyaki for 24 hours, rice (the frozen kind from Trader Joe’s makes it so you can use rice in your meal prep and not hate yourself for how shitty it normally becomes when refrigerated), and steamed broccoli.
---
- Pesto Chicken (5): 2lb Pasta, Pesto, Cherry tomatoes, Chicken Marinaded in Pesto and olive oil for 24 hours
---
Pretty straight forward stuff, just a lot of marinades and pretty equal macro spread. Hope this is helpful!

---
&gt; Doesn't mean people can't form their opinion about if it's worth the money or if it's a scumbag move to suddenly make it "buy only" only a few days before launch.
---
I never said it wasn't a scumbag thing to do. And no, you can certainly decide that it's not worth the money. That still doesn't give you an excuse to ~~steal~~ from him.
---
&gt; I don't think it's anywhere like that.
---
Ask the FBI. They think [differently](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime/piracy-ip-theft)
---
Probably in 7-10 days. It takes almost 5 days /played (24x5) to hit 60 assuming you’re speed running it. Most people will need breaks and won’t be playing for 5 days straight. But the hardcore people can do it between 7-10
---
This is the fucking truth right here.

never heard a bad word about him, a ton of players tweeting about him says a lot I think

40 pictures of catform incoming!

As someone who also played vanilla, go priest save your self some heart ache. I am currently on the fence of war/priest/sham but i know 2 of them will be hard in pvp.
---
You don’t have to play on them until the mailbox gets full if you want to keep sending mail. It lasts 30 days, then 30 days after being returned

Pornhub. Rolling a Paladin.

On the fence? They are BiS.

Hey I recognise that place, I work there!

It's cool seeing the University of Sydney on reddit

Nothing is preventing them. There is a 30 minute timer on the character screen though.
---
Bruh you saw the female orc in the movie right? I’d loktar ogar that
---
&gt;2. it's a high risk to let blizzard design new wow classic stuff
---
People keep saying this and I dont get why. The devs clearly get what made Classic so good and they have 15 years of hindsight under their belts, what worked and what didn't.
---
All they have to do is figure out how to extend the horizontal progression formula and not make as many mistakes as TBC did; with 15 years of hindsight, this shouldnt be an issue (I'm sure people would be willing to forgive what they might consider missteps as long as they stay truer to what made Classic so great than TBC).
---
And? More will be out tomorrow with more on standby. If your want to play on a full server. Just play on a new one.
---
Why does Dire Maul come out in phase 2 when it's a level 40-something dungeon? Seems a little backwards for us to all hit 60, then circle back to DM. But I'm sure I'm just missing something about it. I didn't do much DM back in vanilla.
---
That’s more important. Be grateful and reward yourself with a little WoW after working hard.
---
they got aldi's wherever you live?
---
Tailoring isn't bad at all.
---
Enchanting on the other hand is a huge pain in the arse, unless your going to be your guilds main enchanter or getting fed mats it will take forever to turn a profit.
---
I'd suggest Tailoring + a gathering profession.
---
You get booted after 30 minutes. Clicking around doesn't matter.
---
Does anyone have a list of mage spells that you should skip while leveling ? Could use that.
---
Scratch that, I went and opened up my [battle.net](https://battle.net) to watch it in the client. I haven't watched it in full in years, I actually got so giddy that I shed a tear. So many memories... Tomorrow is going to be the best day ever.
---
I feel that man, pulled a monster fueled all-nighter last semester for a cs exam and had a few times where I thought my heart stopped.

Just bind the stances to keys, I don't get all the fear of stance dancing either. Druids have it just as bad if not worse. Hunters &amp; locks have to bind pet keys and micromanage them.

Just press the button and press the other button you need to press.

Imagine a race of tree dwelling knife-eared bastards who think they're superior to everyone else because they live a long time and pretend their more important than any other race. If they weren't such tree-hugging pretentious hypocrites, they wouldn't have lost their tree the _first time_.

Why Twitch? Sounds immensely bandwidth intensive and wouldnt it be live? Windows 10 has a built in screen recorder, though I dont think I care to use it. I'll just screenshot often
---
You could go Herb / Skinning to start with while sending all the cloth you get to a bank alt. Then you'll have herbs for swapping to Alchemy, Skinning to make money with, and all the cloth you need just waiting for the swap.
---
I’m going to roll a Mage, but I’m in doubt about my professions.
---
I’ve read many times that for PvE you are best off as Mage to go with Enchanting/Tailoring. 
---
For levelling some people recommend Skinning though since it’s supposed to make you a fair bit of money through selling mats without going out of your way to get some income.
---
However, I kind of feel like having Engineering/Tailoring for the PvP aspect of Engi and the gear upgrades from Tailoring. Will I be lacking income if I go with 2 production professions or is this a viable combination? I’m planning to spend a lot of time on both PvE and PvP, so I’m looking for the right balance without having myself completely deprived of cash all the time and not being able to buy a mount at 40/60.
---
False. You'll see.

I got enough T3 mogs on my Druid and Shammy to at least look fully decked out. Logged into retail yesterday for the first time in forever and I hit me how much I love those mogs and how amazing Naxx sounded when it was about to drop. I remember geeking out on those sets as a 12 year old thinking they were the coolest thing I’d ever seen
---
Thank you! Just looked it up, I think it may be willitclassic. Unless I’m looking at a different one.

It was almost always referred to as VC for my entire vanilla experience.   I have no idea why or how it started,  that just how it was referred to on the multiple realms I played on.

Awesome. Will be giving this a go!

That’s the problem. There is already 300+ messages on discord about what server the guild would go to. On each side there are people refusing to switch to the other. Hence the debate to end all debates. I just hope when the smoke settles and yelling stops we still have a raiding code for retail.

I see you don't have a real gamer body. True gamers turn that sugar, fat, and cheese into raw energy.

---
It's a lot more specific then you are implying. If you disagree then I would love for you to post the alg code that you're sourcing from.
---
That's assuming the 60 guild members are online, in your level range, wants to do a dungeon, or that they  have time - same goes for your friends. You make it seem like this situation is simply black and white. "LFG" is an acronym for a reason :P. Let's also not forget how it's a low level dungeon exposing people to noob players.

Nope, TBC and Wrath.

Tomorrow is the 26th, doesn't classic open on the 27th? Did I kiss something?

---
These are the same people who though the  initial population would be like 300k-400k with  5(not  big) servers for each region... Classioc WoW at that pace might even hit 2-2.5million including CHina.

If it manages to keep a stable population of over 500k(which are mny worse estimations..) it will be a massive sucess

Escape artist gets you out of Hamstring, which will be useful if you get charged when you don't have blink up. And it removes nova from enemy mages, denying them the shatter passive. Plus every other thing in the game that slows or roots you. Mages need to be able to stay out of melee range.
---
And if you're about min maxing, gnomes have a higher base int than humans, plus the +5% int racial. It only equates to a few more points of dps, but it scales with gear.
---
But honestly, its classic wow. You're going to be throwing many, many, many hours into this game. At the end of the day play with what you feel is more pleasing. Humans don't have rubbish racials, far from it, and a lot of people don't like the size of gnomes. Or the fact that they have to swim in Swamp of Sorrows, lol.

Log into the que before work, by the time you get home you should only have a few hours left to wait.

Still takes a beefier rig to run it.
---
You went through a lot of effort for something I barely read and a link I won't open.
---
I dont think so , since you cant create a character without sub.
---
They're targeting anyone who searches for WoW Classic stuff, I doubt Google Analytics tracks user information for people who buy gold specifically, that's too niche.
---
No, not per my understanding; I think you only get access to classic if you have a paid account.  The free to lvl20 thing is just for retail.
---
Yes it's real, I can produce more pics if you want

Good question. Take my upvote
---
Every raid is going to have one or two hunters for tranq at the least. Spread over (let's say) 30-50 active raiding guilds per server, that's 60-100 hunters with dedicated spots out of thousands. Also not everyone will want to raid to begin with, and hunters are probably the best soloing pve class in the game.  
---
Either way it will balance itself out. Those that absolutely want to raid, will either get themselves a dedicated spot through whatever means, or they'll roll a class that gets them a dedicated spot.
---
In phase 1 probably not

Recently got into fine woodworking.  Do you have plans for this?  I'm wondering how it all fits together.  Glue or joinery?

Looks amazing.

That doesnt negate the countless players that called it VC in vanilla.  I personally dont recall anyone ever calling it DM back then,  I'm sure other peoples experiences were different.

I would wait a few days and then download Luna Unit Frames it was by far the best for this and can be customized to how you want it. I’m just waiting to see if classic breaks any of them and they have to patch. Don’t want to set everything up just to set it up again in a week

What I enjoyed was that the world felt more like a living world I was exploring.  For example, Tanaris feels like a real desert, part of that though is that its large and sparsely populated, so traveling is slow. Meanwhile, the Desert zone in BFA where trolls are "exiled" is right next door to the capital and has quest hubs every 100 yards, so I never got a desert feel from it. I also liked that the quests themselves were a bit slower and more relaxed. 
---
Having said that, not everyone enjoys leveling. Its why Blizzard made modern leveling so fast.

You can find Classic addons on Curse now: [link](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A7350&amp;filter-sort=4).  You can also use their Twitch desktop client to download/update addons.  
---
I would recommend using the client since it will automatically grab the Classic version of the addon.
---
The meme originated from the clip in ROTS. So really its referencing ROTS which was in turn referencing ANH.
---
I think it will be addressed when BG's drop as it really wasn't fair for some classes, especially warrior who already had high repair costs to deal with. Some guilds subsidized their warriors respecs and repair costs, sometimes you're just boned.
---
XD , its funny because she is fat xD
---
Emote or /commands that aren't handwritten by you (meaning anything that doesn't begin with you typing /me) will be readable by everyone regardless of faction. It's /say and /yell messages that you'd need a translator for.
---
This is very true.  I remember guilds running MC months before TBC released.  Vanilla was try good on all different levels.
---
What is a good spec for a druid..specifically for 5 mans? Want to heal and tank.. a mix spec
---
Probably gonna need some insulin with that.
---
What the fuck? I say that it makes sense that they would target someone who's likely been looking up classic stuff a lot with a classic gold selling ad and you ask me to source code?
---
My friend I’m going to level with has a class that gets out 4 hours after release, so we’ll still be at level 1 in queue.
---
Didnt they say that High and Full servers can still have login q's?
---
Stalagg (NA-EST PvP server), troll mage (solo main), troll shaman (when my friend is online).

This guy rolls need on everything, then vendors it.

Its relation to retail is meaningless. It's a different game. If he wrote the same exact post but replaced retail with Fortnite, or The Binding of Isaac, would it be a relevant post?

Well buddy. It's time you experience your first WoW Fever. Best of luck faking sick this week. Pro tip, drink hot water coffee before you take your temperature, and warm cloth on your head before you tell your mom youre sick.
---
Woe to those who fake sick on server maintenance days.
---
hit right in dem feelz
---
No need,I believe you. It just looks so much like an actual model it's uncanny.
---
Right? Their lore in TBC was fitting for being in the horde.
---
I imagine they'll reset connections close to the launch time to prevent people from doing this. Might be able to jump on a few minutes before, though.
---
im quite sure somewhere was said that they are going to give one free transfer later. So ppl kinda can just start play and later swap to friends server etc without needing to reroll character. but not 100% sure tho
---
Play mage so you dont have to try but still be invited to everything because you're a human vending machine.

Thank you all for your responses! I can’t sleep haha.

Watch class videos. A shit ton exist. Educate yourself.

Portals in vanilla are so handy not only for yourself but also for making some gold in cities. Conjuring food/drink again is amazing for you and party members, lots of utility, and massive dps.

No sir, camera distortion probably

Something that tanks or heals. You always need more of those and can find dungeon groups easier. Get those sweet classic dungeon items.

Does anyone know what % health you have to be to get the maximum haste effect from berserking? Been trying to find data on that and haven't been able to. Or does it just progressively get better all the way down to 1% hp?
---
1. I can’t speak to mages but as for priests, put your first 5 points in spirit tap. The next 5 should go into wand spec. Then start putting points into shadow. At 40 you should respec into shadowform then put your next 5 points back into wand damage boost. 
---
2. It’s always more efficient to grind on random mobs while waiting on quest mobs to spawn. Try to group with others for kill quests but feel free to leave and come back if it’s a collection quest. Most people won’t want to group for those because drops aren’t shared.
---
3. I would recommend staying in a zone until most quests are finished or until they start turning grey. It’s always better to slightly out level the next zone rather than being underleveled and struggling to kill mobs.
---
4. Dungeons are always recommended to break up the monotony of questing and to possibly upgrade your gear. Make sure to get any dungeon quests prior to the dungeon. Some dungeon quests will have prerequisite chains that will need to be completed first.
---
I hope this helps!
---
You said it's a lot less specific and that's a baseless claim that I challenge you on. 
---
Any decent TAA uses subject target reference and not keywords like people in this thread keep claiming. 
---
People searching for gold farming techniques might get cross referenced but Google ad sense 100% uses targeted subject references. That means they use your search history to identify your interest. If wow gold selling pops up then it's a high chance it's in your history to be referenced. 
---
You implied that Google TAA was broadly targeting and not specific. If you didn't intend to mean that then I think you didn't word that wrong.
---
You did a really good job!
---
I'm torn between warlock and mage myself. I played mage in TBC and only got to level 44, so I'm really tempted to finish what I started.

This is the first addon I have ever made (and my first experience with LUA for that matter) so things may be rough around the edges. I tested everything in the retail client and verified via [Globe](https://www.townlong-yak.com/globe/#h:ae22bb9d4df3666959fff651b39707cf) that it should work in Classic.
---
It actually saves a lot more information than the readout is currently showing but future updates should let you use that data to see where you gained the most experience, what mobs you've killed the most of, a heatmap of where exactly on each map each bit of gold or experience was gained etc etc.
---
30 Feral / 21 Resto. It's famously called the HOTW / NS spec. Google it.
---
I remember you in Blackguard. I missed this event unfortunately. I was still leveling at the time so I didn't know how to get to Silithus yet. And I had to go to bed for class the next day so I ended up giving up on it. I'll get my chance again soon though. =D
---
idk might depend on the situation for me
---
anyone know if pf ui works for classic? or if an updated version was made for it
---
You should check out the WoW Diary by John Staats. It's a lot more chaotic than you think
---
I’d say tailoring and alchemy for some good potions. You’ll be loved by a raid guild if you do alchemy plus you conjure drinks. That’s what I’m doing
---
Such sauce mmmm
---
It’s impossible to speed through everything without robbing yourself of the good times in the meantime
---
Thanks man. Do you mean hot water or coffee, or just hot coffee?
---
This face no longer exists on retail. The new model has a nose and lips.

I am definitely #nochanges, but the honor system is truly terrible. Probably the worst part of the Classic.

DM was released to make it a little less impossible for people who hit 60 after most guilds were pretty well geared to get into raids - it's sort of a weird instance, but phase 2 will still fill a similar spot for people who didn't power level at launch to get into raiding. 
---
Nobody really did DM much, it's too bad because it's a neat dungeon, but it has its niche.
---
The fel eggs have a dangerous look to them. Although I bet they're still much healthier than the usual real-life hot pockets + energy drink WoW feast combo :)

Gnome Mage with enchantment and tailoring. Gotta go vanilla for vanilla.
---
I think it was added in wrath.
---
nope
---
Oh man this just reminded me I have a ZG tiger on live. I got it back in Vanilla and quit playing beginning of MoP. Wish I could transfer that guy. 
---
Orange kitty

Only if they're alliance

Well then... keep your feet on the ground....hic!
---
The tier .5 quest line is one of the best memories I have from vanilla. 
---
The maintenance for the patch was extended super late so I didn’t get in til late in the day, but I was determined to do the whole chain (didn’t know how long it was) so I dove in basically racing other people on my server.
---
By the time I got to the strath speed run part it was the middle of the night so I was doubtful about getting a group together, but a friend of mine managed to get a tank, healer, and third dps willing to help even though they weren’t on the quest.
---
Not knowing how fast we had to go, the tank just chain pulled and kept the pace as fast as possible. Once we got to the end where the mobs come out of the baron’s room the timer was ticking down so we moved into the room while killing them and pulled him at the last second. Downed him and it ended up counting since we started combat before the time ran out :)
---
I'm going to unsub for this sub tomorrow. There is literally no reason to come back.
---
HOTW spec - 0/30/21. 
---
For leveling, go feral all the way first. You’ll still be able to heal comfortably most of the way in caster gear. This spec is an endgame tank (or dps) and resto pvp/pve spec.
---
I haven't tried since BFA came out, but one of the quests 1 shot you with unavoidable damage, making it literally impossible. I assume that's been fixed, but yea I wouldnt be surprised if it has other issues
---
i think most people would envy you being able to play classic without having experienced retail.  retial is very handholdy.  classic can on the other hand be very punishing.  its up to you but i would push you in the direction of classic.
---
He's asking if you can send mail to a character you have created but never logged in as.

 You could do it during the last stress test. Not anymore though.

DokiDoki. King of weebs.

You made me feel emotions... stahp it hehe
---
If you are a prot warrior, you are probably going to spending your evenings running dungeons and farming mats for that weeks raid.    
---
Now, one thing that is a privilege of being a tank, you can easily form a group around yourself, and leave out all those in plate or using 2h weapons. Or, if tanks are rare enough, you can sometime find people willing to pay for someone to tank a dungeon for them.    
---
I used to practically extort alchemists on scholo runs (alch lab).  
---
I pvp'd plenty as prot anyways, I saved so many AV's by simply being a beast ass tank, or hauling a flag in WSG    
---
but back to your question, you will pick one or the other, its just part of the game, your choices had more impact and consequence, it added a lot to your characters identity.
---
I tried this too.  I’m just going to set up minimal settings and then tweak while I go on long auto runs.

This meme is of dank quality.

Seems like the login screen takes place in outland and is looking in on what we now know as the blasted lands, before the first invasion.

---
Yeah but I heard alch is a pain in the ass
---
If you honestly believe that flying mounts were a beneficial addition to the game you should not be giving advice on the future of classic. Sorry, but it’s the truth.
---
TBC will kill classic in the long run because there is only one direction the content can take once they release TBC. And that is WOTLK. Making sense now?
---
that’s infinitely better than what I did, but good luck getting meaningless orange internet arrows with that setup ;)
---
I have a few friends I'm trying to wrangle together but plan on trying to find a guild that fits me when the adventure starts!
---
Yeah I just stream for fun here and there these days that's about it. Still been on pservers the past couple of years though
---
Could be done through classic+.
---
Update and restart. Worked for me?
---
Gonna be a lot of people spending their cash at the AH on marginal upgrades. They'll be in for a surprise at 40.
---
My guess is not. Anybody smart won't bother trying to buy mats on the AH early, especially enchanting mats since enchanting isn't very useful until you aren't constantly upgrading gear.

...me :(
---
It's unfortunate that the mentality that raiding is the only way to play the game has become so ingrained in the community.
---
Aren’t you concerned the cheese from the cheese balls will embed into your keyboard?
---
Yeah you probably wont be able to play at launch. Sorry.
---
I got one for athletes foot and I didn’t even know that was a thing until that ad. Maybe someone with itchy feet used my WiFi.
---
The API works the same way in retail, so if you have time to install the minimum you can try on a starter account.
---
I think the problem might be the camera speed, I know you can increase it but uncertain if you can make it move instantly. You could potentially record exp rate and adjust when close, but it would be tricky with large chunks like quests. I guess you could also set the camera whenever you talk to an npc as well.
---
I am actually going weapon smithing on my main warrior so I can make something like this for other people. Maybe even myself ;)

gotta hit em with the /moan and /massage

You'll keep me entertained until the servers launch
---
Dude I can only imagine. I worked for a company who’s names rhymes with Macrosoft and I know the struggles from supporting one of their server farms like on a patch day and holy shit, this would be way way worse. 😂😂 I truly feel for them.
---
TBC and WOTLK had some great parts, and some parts that started the downfall. Grab stuff like the raids, change up the timing of when they are released (stuff like let Ulduar go on longer before just dropping toc, or change the order stuff is released). 
---
If they listen to feedback and do it right, it will turn out amazing.
---
Hahah!!! 
---
Oh man, that's such a good question.. We're laughing about it on discord.
---
This actually helps a lot thanks!
---
And with number 3, thanks for the tip on that especially, me and my friend were quite uncertain about whether or not to leave early or stay, i have no experience really with classic so i dont know if the difference in 1 or 2 lvls makes that much of a difference.
---
No.
---
Thanks!!
---
You mean "couldn't care less", right? I hope.

You must not have played vanilla

Pro-tip, when as a kid I could burp on command, I used to say I had a fever, go to the nurse, and burp while the thermometer was taking my temp, every burp brought up hot air, once it hit over 99.9 I was home free.

I doubt that disenchanting will be profitable early on because no one will have any money to spend at the auction house. If you keep the items you receive from disenchanting on an alt/bank character, the items will be worth something after the server economy stabilizes. Hope this helps!

Imagine grinding all the way through every raid just to be told your hard work be made completely obsolete with the expansion and thinking that's a good way to maintain a playerbase.  Why even bother?

Definitely. Not sure what the color rouge has to do with it though.
---
Prot Pally is a great pick for dungeons as are warriors. As long as you don't really intend to raid as a prot pally you should be good.
---
Classic raids are mechanically very easy. They just require a huge time commitment and basic coordination. Your class will usually have 1 or 2 tasks max per boss. Just dont fuck em up and you’ll be fine. Theres posts in the reddit about how some of the best players in the game back then were clickers and backpeddalers getting 15 fps. If they could do it, you can too. Dont be intimidated and have fun!
---
Human Warrior for PvP
---
Questing, just find the yellow exclamation marks and do the quests. Once you get familiarized with that, try and start leveling some professions. They are extremely useful in Classic. Above all else, enjoy your time and explore! There’s a million things to do and a million places to go, just take it easy and have fun.
---
hard to pick. imo the stun resist is more helpful against a wider variety of classes, with no cooldown. but wotf is a great 'get-out-of-fear-free' card that you can hit at will. 
---
i'd say there isn't a best for rogue. although I may lean orc, because warriors are the big threat to rogues, but it depends on which you like more. consider starting areas, mounts, animations, voices, etc. that'll matter more, since both racials are pretty op

blizz thinks people will stop playing after a few months lmao what a joke 😂😂😂 they gonna have to do paid transfers AWAY from some overpopulate servers which will be impossible to remove layers for.
---
World PvP frequency was balanced around the old concurrent server pops, so if they are too high once phase 2 drops, there will be way more world pvp than there ever was back in the day, because the zone will be fuller. I’m kinda worried about it. I would much rather prefer more servers with the OG server pop, especially as I’m rolling on a pvp server and don’t want it to be a constant gankfest.
---
It is noob friendly but it is also an old game, so it doesn't have a lot of the convenience and other things you are used to in a modern game.
---
The game will kill you if you mess up.

I’m just gonna be spending some time without addons at all. It won’t be too bad as I’m not planning on using a ton anyway. There aren’t many abilities or anything at the beginning anyway.

i've never played any WoW game, but i'm a long time Hearthstone player so naturally, i became fascinated with WoW lore and such. i've decided to give classic wow a go. my friends who are also newbies will be going mage and (healer) druid. so naturally i wanted to fill in the tank role, plus i've always liked tanking in other role/class based games. warrior looks boring lol so i wanna give paladin a go.

i've looked around for newbie friendly protection pally guides for classic wow but they seem a bit scarce. if anyone knows of any or wants to give me a word of advice i'd be really grateful!!!

 'they keep level caps and gear relevant while adding more stuff '
---
OSRS Doesnt do this at all or well.
---
A big portion of content they release, especially in the past 2 years is dead content on release. It wasnt even Power'creep' it was literally just 'Heres the best weapon in the game for 99% of content, enjoy' and since then, even bringing out weapons and armor with higher requirements than said weapon are weaker by quite a large margin.
---
The voting system is also (Finally IMO) getting shown up as a good idea in principle but in reality is killing off new content and updates. Its so stupidly hard to get a 75% majority on anything that has a lasting affect on a game that its pointless when it does pass.
---
Also, talking about only lvl60s and at least 2 final raids to vote? GTFO.

If they ever wanted to release a poll-like system, anyone with an 'active' character in Classic and an active subscription should have the option. I know a ton of people that play MMOs purely for the community and to do their own thing and not have to worry about end game raiding etc, why should they be exempt for the way they play the game.
---
Catering to the 'Best' players (In your opinion, those who do raiding and/or get high af ranks in PVP?) is the quickest, most surefire way for a game to die quickly. The casual players keep games alive, not the hardcore portions.
---
Lol these fatties will be so mad at you :D
---
With you on this, even outside of wow. Hobbits? Cool. Halflings? Cool. Hell, even kinder I can tolerate given the right context. Gnomes, though? Fuck them. Double true in Spelljammer.
---
Lol i have the same card rtx 2060 XQC EVGA?
---
Today's moms too busy on FB or thotting at local gym. They don't care lol.
---
Ah, making pots will feel useful again. Chugging them on CD was great. Mostly remember doing that in BC though.
---
Fair enough
---
Leveling a druid, should I level first aid or sell the cloth? Eventually I will want first aid cause I want to focus on PvP, but money wise I am not sure.
---
Annnnnd prot paladins on the other hand...
---
Just, no.
---
Roll 1 of the 4 new servers tomorrow or get in queue!
---
&gt;If they did, they would be complketely overpowered.
---
Just look at druids in D&amp;D 3.x. They were Jack's of all trades but they basically got full power in all aspects and it made them by far the best class in the game. They were a full spell casting class with a ranger's animal companion and could fight just as well, and often better, on the front lines than fighters, barbarians, and paladins
---
iirc it was the opposite, horde got most of the relevant WF past the first few.
---
Reason being while paladins keep the raid safe and less likely to wipe, when you're pushing the envelope shamans (really wfury) are just better--but take a lot more skill to play optimally.
---
Night elf wisp is op in world pvp you can resurrect faster /smart
---
&gt; You can also use their Twitch desktop client to download/update addons.
---
This is really sketchy though. It works, but is hard to use. It doesn't recognize WoW Classic as a separate game, and will try to put the addons onto BFA client.
---
Man I wish I still knew my friends from those times,would be great to return to a game like this with them.
---
are there viable hybrid holy/protection builds? i wouldn't mind being a healer who can off tank when needed
---

Eat a salad you gross fuck.
---
Why do I feel like WoW is going to make the news again due to someone dying or being negligent
---
You could also be a druid tank if that is appealing to you.
---
Generally RP servers have higher retention, but I don't know any numbers for it.
---
Clearly you have no idea how long it's actually going to take. Try not to die on camera.

No!  You can't use the old addons. You need the new Classic ones.
---
I was sure about mage for months but the last few days the idea of pivoting to rogue has been gnawing in the back of my mind.
---
I'm definitely going troll though. When it comes to server I'm a little unsure, kind of want to go shazzrah, but heard some talk in my old retail guild about going firemaw, so still undecided on that, but I reserved names on both.

They’re fun but slow to level though. Tanking at 60 with them is worth 100% of the pain.

Just an active subscription and the classic client which you can download from the browser. Pretty sure you don't have to download BfA/the current game
---
Goldfish and Dr Pepper is basically organic
---
People let you enjoy the game how you want, let them enjoy the game how they want. You don't need a dick and say "This game isn't for you, go play something inferior" just because they want to play Classic the way they want to play it.

Afraid of "retail noobs" leveling faster and outgearing you?
---
Yeah hunters are great, you can roll on everything too!
---
Then gtfo bro! I wanna do his mom before release!
---
I can't imagine it'd be worth it to do paid runs in Classic. The big raids are all forty man, that's a lot of of people to organize to run others through raids. Though I never got to end game content in vanilla before BC came out so maybe it could be done without 40 🤷‍♂️
---
You know, to me classic is a blessing.
---
I was an avid WoW player, started in WotLK and played until WoD. Not that i did raids or much of the end game, but i really liked leveling alts.
---
My problem with retail started when i realised that if i took a break because of work or college, i would be left behind not only because theres lots of stuff to keep up in the end game, but also because when a patch came, it changed alot for the classes, in some cases it felt like you’re playing a whole different class.
---
With Classic, i know what i’ll be getting into, i know that i can take my time and level at my pace, without the fear of being left behind or having a new patch that will change everything.
---
So yeah, i think that people saying that they have no time, is because they think WoW Classic is more time consuming, when in reality retail is way worse.

There are at least 2 wands which are rewards of alliance only quests or do I miss something ?
---
Its crazy the amount of fanboys he has. He basically has his own WoW army. Its gonna be hilarious if he ends up not playing alliance AND not playing on the server he said in his stream come launch time. I have a feeling hes going to actually end up playing on a low pop PVP server on launch AND/OR playing horde just to fuck with people. Meh, either way, i would like to avoid any streamer servers i possibly can. They are just as much a bad thing as they are a good thing for this game. I think it might add a variable to the game, at least on the servers they play on, that we didnt have to deal with back in 2004.
---
looks nice. GD apple monitor tho !
---
It is, but afaik no one’s ever successfully decoded the algorithm.
---
me too :D what server?
---
I didn’t say it was wrong to want to... just an observation 🤷‍♀️
---
If you play a warrior, paladin or hunter, you must use a swing-timer add-on. As for rogues a energy-timer add-on.
---
Is that and ironing board?

Lol, theres always binary shit like that that people demand on seeing/others having before they will group. People pulled the same shit in vanilla and in BC before achievements were even a thing, it was just with different parameters.

Can't you just farm meat based on your pets diet?

Mumbled this to myself before clicking on the post lol

A good thing to do is get fishing if you have a pet that eats fish. Some pets are hungrier than others, I think bears and boars are at the top. And as mentioned, they don't eat as much once your closeness with them increases.
---
that guy (priest?) with the wand looks so happy.

I dont have hardcore playing in me anymore.   When WOW launched I was playing EQ2 around 50 hours a week.  6 months later I was around level 36 and had grinded my guild to level 15.  I could never put in those kind of hours again.  But my husband and I always wondered what would happen if we had played WOW instead of EQ2.  We will play so casually we might take a while to hit cap in wow.  But at least it's a comparatively easy game, so we feel sure we'll hit cap.
---
rip
---
it is and it was actually my first choice, as i love druids in wow lore and the tank role. i'll give it more thought. thanks!
---
Go frost spec. Ice barrier is OP
---
Should be fine to use your cloth, arguably better, because you will need to level your first aid at some point anyway, may as well do it while there's no market for cloth (everyone will be the same level and also have no money).
---
Any class is good for healing 5 mans. I'd say probably the only thing you'd want to give consideration is Druid's lack of a resurrection without a cooldown, but that can be covered by a dps or paladin tank (which is used in 5 mans).
---
&gt; You get used to it
---
Complacency is no excuse for bad design.
---
I'm planning on using questie but I'm hearing a lot of chatter about Guidelime. Check it out on [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com).

To be fair, SM was part of the challenge mode dungeons in MoP and going through those dungeons for golds was one of my favorite memories of WoW.
---
The regular version of the dungeon is terrible but insert some challenge into it and it becomes fun.
---
Swift kick to the feels.
---
The key is where you live. Do you live in the U.S.? If yes, then do you live on the East coast? then choose an Eastern server. If you live on the West coast, choose a Western server. I think Mountain Time Zone players generally will want to play on PST servers, and Central time zone players will generally want to play on EST servers.
---
If you live on the West coast, and you play on an Eastern coast server, then most of the guilds will be starting raids at like 4pm or 5pm PST, which is not ideal if you have a normal 9am-5pm job. That's why it's a good idea to play on a server near where you live so that if you like to raid or other activities with guild members, they will have a similar schedule as you.
---
Does lupos have shadow damage for classic?
---
About 5 GB.
---
Pretty sure it was wrath as well. It absolutely was not in vanilla at all.
---
That is retail maintenance not for classic.
---
Thanks for all the hard work!
---
Has anyone tested this vs Wow Pro? Curious which I should go with.
---
You mean, as opposed to the totally mature power fantasy of "being the DDEVILSAUR MAFIAAAAAAAAAAA"?
---
The fact that you were on a discord about a 14 year old videogame, linked a page-long post about a 14 year old videogame, and then got riled up enough about a post about a 14 year old videogame, pretty much confirms my above point.
---
So kindly take your pretext of being "oh so adult", wrap it into your hypocrisy, and put it into a little box so it stops humiliating yourself further.

Since she forgot to put credit stuff, the sad lupos art was done by my wife, Dawndragon art ( also known as u/EllenQuipley)

Beast slaying is really nice since you'll wind up fighting beasts a lot and berserking is so useful for any caster or healer.

God damn that was a trip down memory lane. Classic video, god damn they were brutal but always wondered why couldn't they just pick a fishing spot she liked in a non contested zone lol
---
Kargoz has a great Hunter guide for post 60.
---
While it's a great option, you can buy everything an alchemist can make so in terms of minmax it's not the best option.
---
Highly doubt it, as it was patched out before 1.2
---
Exactly *dark grin*
---
Can always bring along a Prot Pally/Elem Shammy/SPriest/etc, too.
---
WAR is coming!!!111 oh wait
---
My advice, don't play prot paladin as a newbie. As specially in the early levels with less gear and talents. You have to put more time and effort into it. At the end, your druid friend is going to tank and you are going to heal xD On top of that you never played WoW before, you will have a hard time as a tank. It is one of the hardest role to enter, but very rewarding! If you a player who likes to read forums, guides and theory crafting then go for pala tank. If not, go for druid!
---
BUT it's classic, so do what you want, the journey is your goal!
---
Yes please let's start a massive welcome to STV across all servers once the majority start going there
---
&gt;it's a fairly safe bet that the population 6 weeks from now will be less than the population 2 weeks from now
---
Well we could be surprised.

---
i've seen a lot of people posting about this. The general consensus is:  NO. there is no way to stop getting kicked out of the character selection screen after 30 minutes.
---
I tried pally tanking back in vanilla. I really wanted it to work. It was passable (but always right on the edge of failure) in dungeons. They don't have a real taunt, so when things get hairy, paladins have a limited toolkit (e.g., BOP on aggro-happy dps). 
---
After OT'ing a couple times in MC it became clear I was much more useful just going full healer (which I liked so it didn't matter). Moral of the story: paladin *can* tank, but it really probably *shouldn't*.
---
Mostly because how effective they are on keeping a lot of enemies’ aggro at once. They obviously lack the taunt ability, which is one of the reasons why they make a poor choice for raid tanks, but they can substantiate a large amount of threat in 5 mans dungeon making them ideal for farming.
---
No they wont. Stop talking shit if u cant read simple blue posts.
---
There is a restart lile 10 or 8hours before, after that u could login and wait untill enter world light u the way.
---
Obvious u have to find the way to not dc after 30minutes, there is one, but nobody will tell it here.
---
No one really knows what will happen, but I don't think you understand how fast these super hyped games drop off in terms of playerbase within the first few months. Although the situation with classic wow and say apex legends is entirely different, if you look at the apex player number it dives off a cliff. Maybe WoW will be different due to its long time fans and it being an mmo, but I wouldn't be surprised if the population dropped off a lot like most modern hyped up games
---
Finally, a decent meal prep post. Rest have been shit tier memes.
---
Yes or a few minutes later in case it's not quite at 6pm.
---
How long do those burritos stay good for?? Do you freeze or fridge? This is doooppe
---
Play what you like! At the end of the day the racial won't make a huge difference.
---
dude in front looks like he could be asmongolds brother lmao
---
If you wave at someone while you are stealthed, will enemy see it in the chat log ?
---
Probably priest. They have the most tools. Bubbles, hots, and stamina buffs.
---
Nope, classic uses patch 1.12, so only a few patches off the hunter pet change in 1.9
---
Nice! I might try and go in early and see if I can sneak out a little earlier. But I think its a lost cause knowing the queue times will probably be brutal any time tomorrow night.
---
Yo the same thing happened to me. Now I’m gonna be two hours behind
---
Yeah doing that now. If after that it still doesn’t work then guess playing Classic will be a $1k+ investment for a new Pc hahaha. Worth it...

Quality post.
---
Back during classic I was in part of a chill guild. I was a very casual player so I spent a lot of time fucking around with my buddy. My friend was very social and vocal, he made friends with another socialite within the guild, a young girl who played as a feral druid. My buddy was always willing to run this girl through dungeons, and I would help sometimes just for something to do. The young feral druid girl began to grow on me because of how vibrant she was, I also found it endearing that she was so bad at the game. I played as a hunter and would use a spell to manually control my pet (white tiger) to dual her in her cat form. I eventually began to run her through dungeons myself. She would pm me all the damn time telling me about the silly and mundane sort of stuff kids like to talk about.  She had a lot of adult female friends in the guild and one day several of them told me that she was seeming to be so much happier since she started playing with me. In the quiet hours of morning one day, when there was just a few of us online, the girl worked up the courage to tell the guild that she was in the hospital fighting some very serious cancer, that was the main reason she played WoW, she just wanted friends since felt isolated by her illness. People were very sympathetic and supportive. I didn't say a thing. She asked me if I had seen what she said, I said something like "Yes, that's too bad." I DIDN'T EVEN CARE. she never spoke to me again that I can recall. I later left the guild to join another that was more active in PvP activies. I was so dead inside back then, I didn't care that my little friend, who was dying, just wanted a bit of sympathy and support. Looking back on the situation years later filled me with so much horror and shame. I'll never forget that, or forgive myself. It ended up being a critical factor that made me decide to always strive towards becoming a kind and honorable person. Her favorite song was "Losing my religion" by REM, I always think about her when I hear it. If anyone ended up reading all this, thank you. If you're out there derpy druid girl, dead or alive, I'm so sorry and I miss you.
---
I would like to think Blizzard will make the best decision on this.  You have to realize that there will be a time when classic gets stale.  People will have done everything, there will be nothing left to do, and most will quit playing.  The only logical thing to do would be bring back TBC.
---
Ideally, it would be nice if blizz had separate servers for vanilla, TBC, and/or WOLK so there is a game to go for those who liked different versions of the game.  Time will tell though and we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
---
Or some new items in general that make specs viable. A few days ago, someone made a post with a bunch of items they made. One in particular was a shield that had a chance to restore mana after a block. If that shield existed in Classic, Paladin tanks could be a real thing.
---
If you think Lupos should still have shadow damage, you’re a complete moron.
---
Oh I remember lol. And thx for the response
---
stop memeing, this diet is cleaner than 80% of the populations.
---
I drink those. I actually think they taste better than the regular monsters. I don't drink them often though. maybe 1 or 2 a week. 
---
I pretty much hate any other energy drink though. They are all way too sweet.
---
Yea.. Hell I'm 47,have to work tomorrow but am leaving the office at 3 for a 5pm server start! I'm like a little kid to some extent. 
---
I just hope it lasts. I'm worried after a bit of time people will give up on it due to the grind that we all know it can be. But man, I am so looking forward to seeing all the zones in their original beauty! Tired of my hand being held while leveling!
---
PLAINSRUNNING.
---
Also I want Runemasters.
---
You didn't even mention Runemasters. They got replaced by Druids but I want some Runetoting Taurens and Dwarves punching dragons to death.

classic is a pretty big grindfest even some of the most excited people on this sub today will be burnt out 2 weeks or a month from now and stop playing.
---
10 per server, twitch client blows for classic add-ons, pretty sure the answer to his question was 12 character limit on names.
---
I'm in the exact same situation (UD Mage). I want to roll Alch/Herb, but apparently the Robes of the Archmage are too good to pass up. 
---
I'm playing casually (dad/work life), so my plan is to level as Tailoring/Herb. I'll collect cloth and herbs along the way, and I'll either stash all my herbs, or sell them for gold. Eventually I'll work my way towards the robes pattern, and once I can craft it and get my BiS gear I'll drop Tailoring for Alchemy and use my  leftovers herbs to level that.
---
Hope that helps! In the end, just go for whatever you think you'll enjoy the most.
---
After like 3 years  of  classic 2 complete raids ever is pretty casual
---
because as an elixir its not worth using
---
i dont think that's accurate. That is definitely true for a private server i played on, but for the beta over the summer (which i played in) i was able to learn all the weapon skills except polearms on my level 1 warrior.
---
Bloody Bargain
---
Biggest moment in gaming for me in a long, long time. The feeling at launch will be amazing. Interesting to see how many of us will be still playing in 1 year
---
Priest. Shaman is close, and you'll probably want shaman if you're trying to speed run 5 mans.
---
You are gonna loose so much time to take your dumps man
---
Because consecration is such a powerful threat tool. If you play a prot paladin right, it really can make for smooth dungeon runs, especially while leveling.
---
While you do have to deal with running out of mana, and a prot paladin without mana is fairly useless, on the flip side warriors have to deal with being rage starved. Warriors really need that taunt to deal with being rage starved.
---
In comparison, prot paladins are really great at getting aggro at the start of the pull. This helps things stay under control and helps the group move quickly and smoothly.
---
well when in doubt you can commiserate with friends and guildies on discord. or in absence of that watch a streamer in queue

Grinding weapon advancement in legion is what killed wow for me. 
---
Also I love small group content, and prefer it over bug raids 100%. But the mythic+ system just bugs me. I cant remember a single m+ I had fun in.
---
[OP](https://i.imgur.com/lCjvB24.png)
---
I was that warrior that thought Defensive stance was terrible because it removed all my abilities not realising it was a separate bar.
---
I now have 5k ish hours and only play through expansions minimally before going back to other games. Retail WoW holds no magic for me. I hope when I revist Classic the magic will return.
---
This is because the horde wouldn't get to Vandar to die to him, they died on the bridge to the bowmen.
---
&gt; I hated the pressure to keep logging in and keep my neck up.
---
One of the legitimate concerns with Legion and then BfA. The system was more unfriendly in Legion. 
---
&gt; I hated the pressure of having to finish a m+ dungeon (which I didn't even enjoy doing) because the chances of a titanforge was too important to not do
---
That can be tedious, but it's only one dungeon at week and you can blow through it with guildmates rather easily. 
---
You realize that all the issues you just complained about are going to be 10x worse in Classic, right? 
---
You said you hate M+ dungeons, but at least that offers you something new to do each week. A new challenge that tests your skills and your group. 
---
In Classic, you'll be doing 5mans that are going to take you an hour or two to complete, that you'll likely run over and over again without always getting the drops you need. 
---
It's why I am genuinely curious.
---
'ER ASSHH! YA MUSH EAT IT!
---
It’s not that big of a deal though. I won’t come home until after 7pm PST. I get to play a few hours, sleep, and do it over again for the next couple years because video games are not a job and I would hate to rush through it all in a month.
---
I figure that out. Late night of studying, can’t catch a break on anything lol
---
Realistically they probably have four to six backup servers for NA, EU.   But they only want to spin them up if they absolutely have to.  They realize that there will be a drop off and don't want people to end up on a low pop server.
---
you can. why not?
---
Mate BBQ chips are always the last flavour to sell and the last left at a party. I think you're a smiths BBQ shill.

---
I didn’t sleep like 1/3 of my guild too. We will sleep later and wake up 1 h before launch :)
---
One of my fallbacks for my Paladin, if I end up not wanting to raid with it, is to find good tank gear, maybe healing some dungeons or MC or whatever, and setting him up as an AoE farming tank.  Essentially to run low level dungeons for special items or gold farming, as well as running noobs through low level dungeons for gear. Also, with some good gear, you can easily tank Scholomance and Stratholme where everything is undead, and lots of people need to run those dungeons a lot for gear, plus the mount in Strat, so I'll be able to sell runs for that too.
---
Not at launch.
---
how much does it weigh?
---
people normally twink 19. Also level 19 twinks can kill an ungeared level 60.
---
You guys? People use these that aren’t 8 years old playing age of empires in 2005?
---
I’m in the same boat as you. I’m hoping you get a valid answer. I’m running a Warrior with a 3 man group but we can only play on the weekends. I want to be able to invest some time on an alt without hindering the flow of my group too.
---
In the event you meant to ask how many characters are permitted in a character-name: 2-12.
---
No you fucking cant. You can play casually and you will suck forever.
---
its also not bloated with tonnes of crap form like 6 expansions. Less is more!
---
Yeah when I played the stress test I learnt 2h swords and such on my warrior pre 10 as well but I’m not sure if that was for ‘testing purposes’ or something.

tauren have bigger hitboxes which is bad for shaman pvp, and troll berzerking is easy can be very good as a caster or healer
---
Gatekeeping is cringey
---
I think it's funny and it's people expressing their excitement. Leave them be you grumpy old bastard
---
*[Diabeetus Intensifies]*
---
One day before launch and I still cant figure out what I will play so I'll pick whatever you guys decide.   
---
The choice is between Rogue and Mage.  
---
\- Solo player
---
\- Pvp guy (I will do dungeons to get some gear but I'll probably dont have the time for raiding)
---
\- Favorite activity is to world pvp while listening to some good old playlists
---
\- Maybe 10h/week to spend in WoW
---
\- Definitly not into spending hours farming the same mob to get one item, so I'm not looking for BIS, just good gear to be able to PvP
---
\- Alliance if that make any difference (Dwarf for rogue, Gnome for mage)
---

Daily’s have ruined online gaming. Every live service now expects you to log in every day to keep up with progression or make sure you get your “free” loot box or card pack or bullshit currency quest otherwise your missing out. I should want to log in everyday because I find it fun not for FOMO if I have other stuff going on. Excited for classic because it’s going to be about the journey and not the end.
---
Imma check this out for sho
---
Because there's really no point in having it be reversible, it's just meant to prevent crossfaction communication in an immersive way.
---
Pservers were opening every 5-6 months dude. Virtually everyone was re-rolling on the new pservers.
---
Public statues for massive achievements. Stuff like...
---
World First to wield thunderfury.  
---
World first to clear raids.
---
World First to reach a gold cap.
---
If your goal is to just tank 5 mans at end game, then no worries, protadin does that well.
---
I made 8, but smaller since I'm not trying for gaiiiiins.
---
* 9 eggs (what was left of my dozen)
---
* 2 jalapenos
---
* 1-2 cups of shredded Mexican style cheese blend
---
* 9 mini pepper blend (red, yellow, orange)
---
* Half an onion
---
* 8 tortillas
---
* Random tube of chorizo from grocery store
---
* Cook chroizo, set aside to cool
---
* 2 TBSPs butter in pan, add salt and pepper, scramble and cook eggs, mix in cheese, set aside to cool
---
* 1 TBSP butter, cook onion, peppers, jalapeno
---
* Lay stack of tortillas
---
* Put in your stuff
---
* Fold them up
---
* Wrap in parchment and put in Pyrex dish in freezer
---
* Pull out of freezer, remove parchment, place on plate and microwave a few minutes until warm.
---
Oh right ... thanks.
---
Btw do you know how hard it would be to craft the rod from enchanting (can you do it as you level if you take enchanting)?
---
playing WoW with your secret girl crush best friend is just going to further put you into the friendzone......but good luck with that.
---
enh felt completely different though, i mained fury and enh through tbc, wrath and cata. enh was fury on nitrous
---
I believe tauren got a bigger deadzone so orc
---
been waiting for years.
---
every detail planned out.
---
cant decide on face.
---
Yeah, but everything takes 5 times as much time still.
---
Finding a group and doing a dungeon takes like 2 hours unless youre a tank.
---
BFA is definitely more grindy on the high end, but classic has some barrier of entry to it.
---
You cant just knock out a dungeon run in 30 minutes with minimal hassle.
---
I've played vanilla and retail pretty extensively. Original vanilla from Dec 2004, and then another 2 years on Nostalrius, where I raided through BWL. So I'm not talking out of my ass here.
---
The thing about Legion and BFA is that you have to keep logging in very regularly to keep pace. If you miss a week or two, you need to farm WQs to catch that AP back up and it feels like a total chore. If you miss some m+ chests, you feel pretty envious when a guildie gets some sweet TF ring. It just feels like you missed a chore and it sucks, even if you make every raid night.
---
Oh and I just hate running the same dungeon over and over again to get the same loot over and over again, but with better ilvls. In vanilla I run the endgame dungeons a few times for my own pre-BiS and then only to help out a guildie. There is no pressure to run a dungeon every week. Once your guild is up and running you replace that raid loot, so you don't have to keep going back to the 5-mans.
---
But my main point was the feeling of having to do boring / unwanted content every week - on Nostalrius I was on vacation for a month and came back, there was none of that feeling of "Oh god I'm so behind I need to grind WQs"
---
I'm glad I'm not doing the essences now... it's just a sub retention mechanic and it sucks.
---
i talked about this in a video yesterday but what i believe will happen on launch is everyone picking up skinning + herb/mining and not leatherworking, making leather dirt cheap.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scoyhe7zlNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scoyhe7zlNc)
---
Dominos worked on the stress test, Bartender didn't.
---
Not gonna lie, this is one of the coolest pieces of WoW art I've seen in this sub. I would love to have this on my wall painted on canvas!
---
You say that like you know what "makes classic classic", like it's not a game of blind jenga.
---
Update: restarted my PC and it let me start the download for the game itself but the Blizzard update is still chilling at 0%. Guess we’ll see what it looks like in the morning
---
Druid, once you decide that you save yourself having to choose a class
---
That's true, it's only for the min/max guys who wants to get more out of their class. Maybe some "one-bag" things or some "auto-selling/repair" but it's personal preference.
---
Btw swing timer works.
---
Yeah they do but nobody really uses them outside of pvp.
---
/s
---
Yes
---
That's a really smart idea. Wake up well rested and ready to grind.
---
Though me personally if I had the option would wake up 2h early. I'm useless for 1h lol.
---
Just put every moron in zone and global chats on ignore, convince your friends to do the same, and let them reap the rewards of acting like a moron in the endgame.
---
The kids arnt ready
---
and the grind will be unreal
---
but i hope it last
---
-_-
---
They really should spend a year or two making a couple "classic plus" realms where they rebalance some stuff

Holy shit use the search feature.  This has been asked 40 times a day for the last week
---
Orc is way better in PvE and arguably better in PvP.
---
Well the guide is for the addon this post is about, i'd call it a fair plug.
---
Swamp-Eye Jarl! Along with his buddy, Mordant Grimsby.
---
As a new player, just ensure you let others know you’re new. How they handle it will tell you everything you need to know about that player.
---
I made meal sizes servings of cilantro lime brown rice, black beans, sauteed bell peppers &amp; onions, all topped with pork pulled from these beautiful 18 hour smokes pork shoulders. 
---
All home prepared.
---
&gt; I think the permanent decline will start when Halo 3, Borderlands 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 come out on Steam. 
---
I don't think I have seen anything more stupid that this comparison. Those games don't share the same market as Classic.
---
The comparison is idiotic.
---
Gnome female mage with pink hair; was almost exclusively horde races back in the day so i wanted to experience something new
---
Time spent in either game offers the player vastly different outcomes. 
---
You can get more done, and have more experiences in retail than you can in Classic. 
---
Think about it. I'm an Alliance player looking to do Shadowfang Keep. I login but I only have an hour to get a group, travel out to the instance, and then complete it. 
---
There's ***no fucking way*** I am getting that done in that amount of time. 
---
In retail? Easy. I can probably do it two or three times in that amount of time. 
---
Ease of access and ease of entry is what it means to be a casual game.
---
She actually introduced me to the game, so we will see
---
I hear you. I should sleep. Wake up. Go tomorrow hard so I can go wow hard. But here it is. 11pm and I'm about to eat dinner.
---
Cool set up mate. Man I’m so excited
---
Yup! Thats the plan!
---
what if you have no friends or all of your friends are playing on a pvp server and you want to play pve :(
---
Nice Prep! I thought I was doing well when I made 3 Giant burritos, some fried rice (about 3 containers) and making 6 servings of Shepard's pie. Glad to know I am the not the only one who plans on eating something other than junk food over the next week.
---
You’re gonna fit in just fine.
---
Mostly to keep your supply of potions high, and your class buff isn't very good since you shouldn't really need an armor buff if you aren't doing PvP - so it's nice to use elixirs when you have them to help speed up leveling.
---
&gt;  You have to realize that there will be a time when classic gets stale
---
It wouldn't with the constant idea of "free DLC", aka more raid content, dungeon content, items, potential build types, new world pvp stuff, and whatever else they could come up with that doesn't ruin what makes classic so good.  
---
More raids, dungeons, interesting itemization, crafting recipes, and world pvp would just make classic more addicting, and wouldn't take away from anything that makes classic special.
---
The endgame experience got better in TBC, but the game experience as a whole got worse if you ask me. It was all about getting to endgame quickly and then straight into heroics and raids, unlike in vanilla where you would probably find yourself running a ton of dungeons in the level 45-60 bracket before even getting to max level, to find some of your BiS gear from sub-60 dungeons, especially BRD.
---
Yes. I have so many partial toons. Only ever fully leveled a priest and a druid. 
---
I always always always loved the mages, especially looked up to PvP mages.
---
Now,  nows my chance to be my own idol. I will stick to this mage and I will wait until 60 to level anything else....
---
*ask me tomorrow*
---
druids are more or less the worst healers in almost every single given context. you only need one per raid; taking more than that tends to just drop your guild's capacity to heal (almost all current healing records and leaderboards otherwise are dominated by priest/paladin). also, innervate isnt even a strength of resto - every druid has it in their base kit to use on priests or whatever they feel like. feral tanks are incredibly strong btw, but are far more specialized in both their preparation and purpose as a tank
---
worst case scenario is this: you play a druid, level with feral talents, and try both tanking and healing the early dungeons to start getting a feel for it
---
Just realized it’s in the title...my phone app only showed half of it, i feel dumb lol
---
Yum looks delicious
---
Yeeah but Warglaives of Azzinoth are in BC... soo yeah.
---
smh
---
Thought about doing this, already have a wireless mouse but just the basics beyond that. Once I fully get re addicted will prolly have to change it up lol
---
At first glance these looked like Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom LOL, I’m seeing WoW everywhere..
---
Wow I haven’t seen this post yet in last hour , thanks!
---
I’m kinda excited myself, although I never played WoW. Have you figured out what class you’re gonna play? I feel like I find one I wanna play but then I read up on another class and then I’m back to square one again!
---
I mean the Surface Book 2 can get pretty beastly for a laptop with an I7 and a full GTX 1060. The only problem is cooling and that it eats your battery unless it’s plugged in... which further causes issues with cooling:
---
Yes druids are decent healers. They can easily solo heal a dungeon and contribute to raid healing. They also bring lots of buffs exclusive to the class. Mark of the wild, Thorns, Innervate, Faerie fire and battle rez.
---
Choose whatever class you like, they are all good and desirable for groups.
---
Everything is a hunter weapon.
---
Faster bank/AH/mailbox loop.
---
Where is the video
---
Any hunter macros using the newer wow client? I understand on private servers, there was more limitations.
---
Tldr.  "Whole day" means the whole time you're awake.  No one subscribes to you're "after work" definition of whole day.  Stop trying, retard.
---
Post Cataclysm maybe :-P
---
Easy, just play at work :)
---
Lol. It's really easy not to die in vanilla dungeons. Not having a res as a druid probably costed my groups a grand total of 60min in dungeons with 30 days played on northdale.
---
It hardly matters lol
---
So, it's like saying that day is day and night is night.
---
Can you be more stupid?
---
I'm so glad the streamers all agreed on one server. I'm glad I only play on rp realms
---
lmao this is pretty good
---
whats everyone planning to do while they wait in queue? I have some tv episodes and youtube videos im thinking of throwing up on my tv while I wait 
---
I'm extremely excited to play...can't wait to play whack-a-mob with my bow and zero arrows
---
Trolls ride around on Raptors, the coolest of the Horde mounts.
---
Undead start at 0/3000 Neutral with the other races, so you have extra-far to grind rep to get a Raptor as an Undead.
---
dude youre good my girlfriend is going to play on a ThinkPad from like 2010. I use to play TBC and WOTLK private servers on that thing with low settings at 60 fps. Vanilla will run just fine with onboard graphics.
---
Whats the first alliance leveling zone where all races converge, similar to the barrens, I guess?
---
I'm playing NE and want to level with my dwarf/gnome buds asap. Thanks.
---
I can't remember which wing, but me and this gang of rogues and an animal druid who couldn't get into normal groups all went in and stealthed in together. We would sneak around anything we had the space to, and when we had to fight we would sap as many as we could and we'd pop our cooldowns and just try to burst down things one at a time before we'd die. I can't even remember if we managed to kill the boss we were hunting, the druid at some point tanked as the bear but we didn't have a healer so I dunno how deep in we ever got. Still, it was a fun couple hours just sneaking around as a group not really equipped to beat anything
---
I’ve just taken all of these names on every server, sorry they were too good
---
OP is a bold one
---
I know BRD well now. It only took 15 years.
---
I like aeroplane Jelly, Aeroplane Jelly for me! I like it for raiding, for PvP! A little each day to help ding 60!
---
Unless they roll out BC or wrath.
---
I actually did the name reservations at work hahaha. Brought my laptop in. Luckily my boss was on vacation.
---
And what about gear ? Is one of them really easier to gear as a solo player ?  
---
I would like to be able to solo pvp as fast as possible and I'm afraid that rogue (which is my main since TLK) require too much times before being good.
---
Out of the three. Gankcity
---
Which route is quickest though? Joana/Sage or someone elses?
---
Shadowdeath
---
Is the guild name character length 24? at some point it had grown but nobody has said when! Thanks in advance
---
I think novelty/class based names are tacky and never funny.
---
&gt;while I listened to the mages rage
---
Shoulda used forbidden Fel powers
---
Argh yes I did this on retail. I have so many toons who are sitting at low ranks cause I either didn’t like the race or just didn’t like the class 🤣
---
Full = 17,000+
---
High = 12,000+
---
Medium = 8000+
---
Low = up to 3000
---
Would be my guess.
---
Very nice Prep Op! Looks clean!
---
How common are PUG groups in classic for stuff like MC or BWL? I wanna raid and at complete BWL (that's my goal for classic). My schedule is all messed up and I would only really be able to raid on weekends. I plan on taking my time anyways so I really don't know how raids were handled on private servers. All my vanilla experience comes from when I was 12 and trash at the game. I remember back then almost nobody made PUGs, on my server at least.
---
I'd argue that pet variety was still higher even with lupos and his shadow damage. The movement speed dramatically varied your pvp pet options (I remember specifically taming Takk the leaper to chase people down), and you could make alot of arguments for high attack speed pets being top tier for knockback in pvp. 
---
Now for pvp you will find exclusively broken tooths (and zg bats when it comes out)
---
And pve wise people will always find what numerically is the highest dps pet, and gravitate toward it. I wouldn't be surprised to just find a thousand broken tooths on every hunter, as he was excellent in raids and pvp.  You could also make an argument that snarler was a better pet for some fights, as he was far tankier and a pet that is dead to aoe isnt doing any dps at all.
---
imna kick their shit in come AV
---
Oh look dad, another random plugging his twitch/youtube!
---
Dude that sprouted red jasmine rice from Trader Joe’s frozen section is legit.
---
The pre-workout I take has 400mg I hardly drink coffee ever but I've seemed to get used to it. At first my heart would pound out of my chest, I would have shortness of breath, and be very anxious. However, now I seem to only be slightly anxious if at all.
---
Are you Journey? :|
---
Im using my onboard from a bad dell i bought in 2013 and its working fine! get 40-60 fps on retail with addons. Hoping its even smoother on classic and I can turn those graphics up lol.
---
Gankersore? (canker sore)
---
I haven’t taken a day off in a year including sick days, I fucking earned this
---
My buddy I'm leveling with (and work with) sent me a picture of pizza rolls &amp; bagel bites as his meal prep and I was just like, "you got balls binging on all those carbs &amp; sodium".
---
pffffftt. just you wait!
---
I'm not really sure that's true. It's going to *look* a lot like vanilla but a lot of the higher-level graphical improvements are staying, and that could run your AAA's dry.
---
Pee pee poo poo
---
Weren't Defias Pillagers ranked 2nd in Vanilla? :D
---
Hunters are quick to level, but they are far from "too easy and not enough depth". Hunters are one of the most complicated classes in the game and have the highest skill ceiling of any class. Hunters get the "huntard" or "easy class" rep because they are pretty forgiving when levelling to just standing around and auto-shotting while pet attacks.
---
However if you actually understand your class, how to weave skills into auto-attacks, and kite your enemies - you'll see the class is anything but a class for noobs. A good hunter will impress everyone, because few people truly play the class how it is supposed to be played.
---
Is bloodrage really that good of a CD that even on Rogue it makes a big difference in PvE?
---
You say that, yet you're still speaking in pseudocode. Speaking all in general, no specifics.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, i think you're just over simplifying things.
---
Vanilla WoW (through to WotLK imo) was lightning in a bottle. Why fuck around with something millions of people loved (and would love to revisit) to placate a few thousand?

Is bfa that rough? I remember missing a couple of weeks of legion and was still at the same ilvl as most of the other lads.

Can a mod delete this? Reposting and even removing the credits of the creator...
---
I personally liked that grind, because it was pretty much like the wintersabers, but a bit more streamlined. Took a long time, and you could also grind it without doing dailies by getting the eggs.
---
Onboard graphics for the real classic experience here we go!!
---
not exactly streamers, but famous youtube content developers like Kargoz is going Skeram, and Skarm is going Fairbanks.
---
&gt; If blizzard starts pushing phase releases every couple weeks it will just provide incentive to rush 60
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I guarantee you that's not what they're planning to do. Each phase will probably have the longevity of a retail raid tier, we're probably looking at ~2 months before BGs
---
BGs are phase 3, which means they would have released BWL in 2 months. Yea, no.
---
My question is did anyone in the beta test Gnomish Mind Control Cap + Hunter's Eyes of the Beast
---
Legion and BFA were both world releases and were very smooth. I'd expect the same for Classic.
---

in 2007 I got 5~ FPS in cities, and 10~ FPS in the world on the lowest graphics and resolution. played on that half a year before upgrading. I was able to level on it, but had to upgrade the ram to half a GB to be able to raid. Got from 1-70 and was able to raid Kara and get a couple epics.

I had a 2002 compaq presario 6010US. it had 256MB of RAM, and a 1.4ghz single core processor with an integrated graphics card.

Triple buffering only helps when you have Vsync enabled, which introduces mouse cursor lag. Not recommended unless you have screen tearing issues.

Looks awesome! Great work.

Thats even worse than not going to work

Yes. 100%. The current record is 4 days 6 hours and it’s held by Joana. He has been saying all week he’s extremely confident someone will break 4 days including himself and he wouldn’t be surprised if someone goes sub-3 days.
---
Yeah, just a quick hello would be awesome but not hearing back would be worse. I like to think he went on to bigger and better things in life. We had fun back then.

Agreed. Save cloth that you don’t use to level First Aid (it will be worth fuck all on the AH for the first couple of months anyway). Go Mining/Engineering (level engineer as you go), or go Mining/Skinning (save all mats). Then switch to Tailor when you get leveled and have enough cloth to level it right up.  
---
I’m still contemplating Enchant/Tailor or Engineer/Tailor for max level, but I doubt I will be leveling as them. Idk, I won’t have much time to play and I’m a casual either way, but it seems that with the markets in flux for the first few months of play, the best bet is to play conservatively and sell collected mats once all the MLGs have gold to burn at the AH.
---
I've never even played WoW but a lot of people say that PvP is the way to go. I don't know though, I've always been a PvE kinda guy but maybe it's time to try and mix things up? The only thing I worry about is that I'm gonna be abused as a complete newbie and it'll put a hamper on the amount of fun I can have, especially since I literally know nothing about the game. I also won't be playing with any buddies so I don't know if I should even bother :(
---
my guild has several people doing classic.
---
Incorrect; Classic is *based* on Patch 1.12, they're *calling* it Patch 1.13 to differentiate that from Vanilla.
---
1.13 never existed in retail; the last patch of Vanilla was 1.12.2 in Oct '06 and went straight to 2.0.3 (TBC) in Dec.

Honestly i'm going to take tomorrow off as well. Can't wait to fucking play this game!
---
Hacrowoft?
---
But didn’t he account share? I thought blizzard was much more strict about that these days.
---
Because now it isn’t about ilvl. I pushed my char to 420 before I left but you also have rep grinds and new essences to worry about that I just didn’t feel like dealing with. And the new zones they added were pretty much just time sinks and boring wq. Like I love WoW like love the game but sometimes I feel like it was made for 10 year olds with how trivial some of the content is. I just hope classic brings back the spark for me or I may be done with WoW....
---
Really just depends on how I'm feeling but I'm too nice to kill someone 20 levels lower than me while they are questing.
---
I didn't say that; I was describing what would happen if they create separate TBC servers.
---
jeez what did reddit ever do to you
---
I mean, you can't trade your old stuff if you've already used it as it would be soulbound.
---
Joana? No way. No account sharing at all, he’s a legend.
---
You are right. When talking scale. Twice as big = 4 times the pixels.
---
My 2017 i7 can run retail at 12ish FPS with decent settings with the GPU off. Classic, by comparison, is super easy, barely an inconvenience
---
That's some pretty unfortunate timing, I'm guessing it won't be up at launch, I really wanted to use it for my early levels to get ahead a bit, and I've been using his guides for so many years that I don't mind paying him a bit for his work.
---
Oh c'mon now this isn't fucking fair.
---
I lay here waiting
---
Atop my cool bed staring
---
At my phone screen
---
They're all taken
---
HahAA brother I love it!! see you there ally PIG!!!
---
haha glad you liked it bud! i couldve done some more stuff at the end during the "Horde getting ready to push AV bridge" part in hindsight but like the post says, im no meme warlock!
---
Jesus christ ...
---
Not a question but today, I dug up my old WoW Box. Inside i had a few of those 10 day guest passes. for shits I entered the codes on the redeem part of the Blizzard app. and holy shit 2/3 worked.  
---
If you guys still have those old codes give em a shot, you might get lucky :)
---
This is amazing I love it
---
Kill it with fire!
---
Thx
---
Is it on curseforge too?
---
You sure that works in china?
---
i cant speak for priest since ive neve given it a lot of playtime. i ADORE shamans though. theyre generally pretty relaxed (90% of your gametime is straight up just chain heal spamming), but totems are insanely strong. a lot of unique mechanics surround the totems. definitely look at a list of all of their totems! theyre INSANELY demanded on horde because of how immensely strong totems are. seeing 6-8 shamans per raid is common
---
one blessing/curse about shamans is that the healing is done FOR you by chain heal. shamans never top meters. they have the same output on every single fight
---
shamans are ultra stubborn in pvp
---
Since it's only a guesswork from combat log data in Classic, what's the big deal?
---
Threat data was not accessible in the API until Wrath and Blizzard is staying true to that.
---
That’s definitely not what will happen my dude.
---
First time was early on, spoke a bit about molten core on the private server scene. Then I was on for The Great Debate, helping out team changes cause they were a bit short handed. Go by PWJ
---
that looks like it might have to be the move, will have to run to best buy before work
---
The guild?
---
I'd assume Omen?
---
I understand if u don't have time to play at the level u want but even like 30 mins of  doing whatever is fun in classic at any level so just come play bitch
---
When did they say they wouldn't add pandas?
---
I have the same 2 guides... and the atlus
---
It is indeed what I meant by character limit, my apologies.
---
Thanks to everyone regardless, for answering my questions.
---
Could Be yes. We always need dispels and pala are good at this. 
---
Plus if you can bring this blessing instead of salvation for tanks, it’s good
---
Get lots of spirit 
---
Lookout for hot staves
---
That's my point...
---
 Player A -  "if somebody did a thing it could work really well!!"
---
 Player B -  "like what?"
---
 Player A -  "i dunno... ^^something^^"
---
 Player B -  "right..."
---
That's the other obvious problem with it, I guess they're trying to establish an early user base.
---
RemindMe! 14 hours
---
Yep, it's one of those rare moments.  Haven't had that "Christmas Eve" feeling for a loooong time.  Sleeping is gonna be rough tonight, and I'm far from alone.  You're all out there laying in bed wide awake too right along with me (not literally though).  Events like this don't happen often, so it's cool to be a part of it.
---
As a casual, is it OK to roll on a PvP server or shall I stick to PvE to avoid getting constantly ganked by much better geared players?
---
I mean paladin warrior seems kinda kick ass to me. With the buffs to attack power and strutting around the world as a devastating duo delivering holy vengeance to all. Then like a cool sword drops, someone ninjas and now you lost your best friend and innocence .... yea nvm play priest.
---
Honestly, I would do something else.
---
Early on you need some bags, so one of you should go tailoring (recommend priest). So your warrior friend can give you his cloth.
---
Another point is, wands are extremely strong for a priest. But difficult to get some early on. For that, you need enchanting (also priest).
---
Your warrior can be alc/herb (health/mana pots &amp; buffs) or if you wanna get a wand earlier skinning and leatherworking. To produce you some green times to disenchant.
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
I have school when it releses :(

too many sensitive people on the internet now.
---
My 9 year old wanted to know more about the game I was so excited about for so long yesterday. I went and found the Blizzcon reveal video where they played all the WoW trailers, but in reverse. 
---
As she was watching I was softly explaining what was happening, what each expansion changed and how one reversal led into the former. 
---
When it got to the orginal trailer with the Dwarf Hunter outside Ironforge, I started tearing up. I was still explaining but my voice began to crack. It shook; I couldn't hold a steady intonation. When the video ended they all could tell how shook up I was, and how big of a deal this actually is for me.
---
We're coming home.

Advertising like this will never work. It’s doing the opposite it’s annoying people. What should you do to grow your twitch? (Because starting of twitch will probably never work unless you are top1 in a known competitive game). Start making content on other platforms and lead them to your twitch channel. Start a YT with good guides etc and learn the algorithm to get the first viewers. Start to work in a discord(etc) community and make yourself a name. Paint funny comics for Instagram/Facebook and cross post ur twitch etc.. Ads like this won’t work. You know what I mean. Do it clever not dumb

Almost no-showed on a date because I was raiding MC for the first time.

Fell into a pet farming addiction, kind of did nothing but farm the dragon whelp pets for a long time.

Too much groveling for my liking, respect is earned not given away freely. I just continue on as if they weren’t there and only very rarely do I get killed. Fortune favors the bold. 
---
If they help me in any way, that’s a different story.
---
Not this post again for the 10000000x time this week, say it ain't so
---
Felt it was fair cause I’m kinda needed and 5 days off the world turns to shit so hope they’re happy with the time I put in before I left.
---
Ugh, the chore list. Leveling characters is so satisfying until you hit the end game. That's when you run face first into a brick wall of dailies. Every since the game became centered around them, I become burnt out quicker and quicker each expansion. I keep up with news of retail and saw that they released flying this last patch.... with 2 more reps to grind of course. That killed any small urge to resub again.
---
Not the real vanilla experience unless your grades suffer. It came out when I was in college 😂
---
Unironically this

Please drink a lot of water too. It gives you good energy

I wouldn't worry about it, the first day is most likely going to be a lag fest.
---
Stalagg.

Hell no. I'm in IT and believe me, they're more excited than you are.
---
Herp Derp. 
---
Go play the Demon Hunter starting zone and tell me that it's not an immersive experience. 
---
Then show me ***any*** leveling zone that offers the same amount of "journey" in Classic. 
---
You can't. It doesn't exist. 
---
I don't give a fuuuuuck about retail. 
---
I'm just wondering why people are misrepresenting Classic. 
---
It's just so fucking interesting. 
---
It's almost like a cult. It's all opinion based, of course, that goes without saying. I mean, you can like how things were or how things operated. 
---
But why compare it to retail in any way shape or form? Classic is objectively worse in almost all regards when compared to retail. 
---
If you said, "I like Classic because paladin tanks are shitty, but super niche and I want to do that" I can dig that type of statement. 
---
Or "Rogues were really good in pvp and almost broken, so I want to kill someone in a stunlock." I can dig that too. 
---
"The game was really rock paper scissors in pvp, and I liked that about it. Retail is more "balanced" (as much as it is) so any class can fight almost any other class." Great! Cool. 
---
I've yet to find any one as openly honest about the game as that. It's mostly just circlejerk and misrepresentations.
---
There’s a racist joke in there somewhere
---
What's the most balanced looking EU PvP server in terms of Horde/Alliance population? Obviously won't know exact statistics but apparently, Shazzrah is something dumb like 36% Alliance/64% Horde.
---
Nice to see u again
---
Thanks, I've always wanted to see a picture of some stranger's soapy bathtub...
---
'No one ever got ahead by following the rules' And that is exactly why the world is so shit currently.
---
What's wrong with buying gear? Why even play a game then? You aren't playing it. You are just paying for a game and then paying for the content.
---
And finally, yes. It's a problem Blizz gotta solve. That doesn't mean you aren't complicit in it by giving money to scammers etc. for it. It's like buying stolen goods. If there is no one buying them, then they won't be sold. You enable this behaviour.
---
 bravo, this is pretty dark tho ngl
---
For sure.
---
I love tanking and dungeons.
---
Then i love grp pvp in wich warrior seems to be strong and i dont like casters. 
---
The tanking aspect is the biggest point to let me choose warrior.
---
He didn't specify his guide was part of this addons, unless I'm blind. Either way, my b.
---
im playing 30fps on a laptop :(
---
I 100% agree, and while I know not everyone enjoys the grinds, I loved things like the Saberon in WoD which were literally just grind mobs.
---
More importantly though, my number 1 issue with rep is every single fucking rep for like 2 expansions now is acquired the same way: World quests.
---
Why do they have to be so bland and acquired through literally the exact same method? Why not have a reputation tied to grinding, or a reputation gained via dungeon mob kills? Why can't the 7th Legion be tied to World PvP, hell even make islands reward it so that people can play vs. AI to get their rep. 
---
Reputation has lost all it's meaning, and offers nothing anymore. Outside of literally the first 3 weeks, it doesn't even reward any meaningful gear, and you don't even get a mount unless you're willing to spend another 10k.
---
I can only tell you what I've heard, haven't played them myself:
---
Shamans and pally both struggle while leveling due to weak DPS specs. In the endgame both work well as healers, but as weak DPS have no real viable mob farming options. Paladins can work as pvp healers, while shamans are renown for their pvp burst damage (if you can gear their burst spec, which is a challenge since people don't want you in pve) or as a healer.
---
Paladins have a rep of being boring rotation wise, while shamans have an element of finesse/skill due to totem twisting. If you're really set on one or the other, I think shaman offers a much more open ended playstyle.
---
That’s how those work, now i just want to call them Threat Accountants
---
10/10. Level 30 warrior doing whirlwind axe quest had me laughing good.
---
cool dude!

@Mods: How is this not a low quality meme and others are?
---
OBS is free and braindead easy to set up, like IIRC it worked fresh install.
---
Cant W8 for STV!
---
I wish, I just manually set it to each zone I was in for funsies. There is actually a proper way to do it, it's commonly done behind monitors to sort of extend the color and make it seem more open.. but I can't find it right now.
---
And thanks lemme know if you want one and maybe I can make one and send it your way.
---
Lol. Yea maybe for all the overtime they are gonna get if they aren’t salaried. 👌

Good news!  There has been some research in this area, thought you might find this study interesting...   [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171206141648.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171206141648.htm)

What mechanism triggers increases in gray matter, especially in the hippocampus, after playing video games? "3-D video games engage the hippocampus into creating a cognitive map, or a mental representation, of the virtual environment that the brain is exploring.," said West. "Several studies suggest stimulation of the hippocampus increases both functional activity and gray matter within this region."

I know fellow warrior! Loktar Ogar!

Its 10.7, for sure.

What professions should I pick for rogue? I was thinking something like herbalism/Engineering
---
What is the fun in that. I like my discord layout like this.
---
If you have limited time. Go druid, can do it all in one package. Really fun class.
---
I enjoy seeing it, shows how excited everyone is. An it’s like popcorn at a movie, unhealthy food while ya play WoW classic!
---
I don't know if they said they will never add them(they probably never did) but they DID make an april fool's joke about adding pandas once.
---
I'd say " back to better " . Like that series you watched and the first season was ok but it keeps getting worse with only some good small things throughout u feel me
---
Eh.  Going in makes it so taking tuesday off wont be a problem at all, so its worth it.
---
I also fucked up and apparently turned my alarm off in my sleep this morning...so i didnt get out of bed until 12:30 (no idea how the fuck i slept that long).  Sleep tonight was going to be rough either way.  I guess ill be staying up later tomorrow night than i expected.  W-F might be a bit rough for getting up for work....rip &gt;_&lt;
---
Lol this isn’t Spain in the 15th century. This is a video game. And If you want to talk economy, let’s talk about how Garrisons completely destroyed the economy in WoD. Me buying a couple gold pieces isn’t going to bring an end to your classic experience. It was fine back in 2004 and it’ll be fine now. The only thing that messed everything up was Blizzards recklessness.
---
&gt; Having the best gear go to people who earn it 
---
The people that have the best gear will be the people that play the most. This shouldn't be a controversial statement here. 
---
You could be ***the best*** player in the world. If you don't have the time to put into this game compared to other players doing the same content, you're not going to even come close.
---
Fry it.. first? I think frying it IS sacrificing it - at least I hope so.
---
I remember the low drop rates!
---
When the skull is ridning epic mount and you just dinged 39.
---
Love it! One thing I'm looking forward to most is playing the AH, always been one of my favorite parts of the game. Flipping tmog in WoW many years ago got me into flipping on Amazon irl :)
---
I'm so incredibly excited. I never played wow before about a month ago and I finally get to experience what it was like.
---
The spirit thing is cool and nice. But i dont want to min/max while leveling. The speed is not impprtant more the fun.

Leveling as arms or fury is much easier than prot.
---
Your Wand is worth more than skills, it's like playing without an arm. Would you rather lose a finger or an arm?
---
I actually looked around for a bit before I realized what you meant lol
---
also thanks for making my stoned ass REALLY want fried chicken randomly.
---
Classic has stupidly low system requirements.
---
You might have to lower settings, but it will work.
---
Am I in the fucking dementia ward? Why do I get reminded this many times about basic shit?
---
If you love to tank you can sure make your way through a lot of content by getting in groups, making some new friends to stick with etc. There will be tons of people playing and tanks are always in demand so Warrior seems like a good fit. And yes, those are some of the big spikes dps wise.

No problem! Yeah with some of the staples, you’re stuck with grilled chicken most of the time because once you venture to some of the others, it goes downhill health-wise real quick. If you don’t see one of your favorites up there, lemme know and I can provide any insight I can. Cheers!

replacing the files for what youre wearing with what you wish you were wearing. obviously server side nothings changed but client side the appearance will

Of course they won't, would still be awesome
---
ESO definitely has better quests/ingame lore than Vanilla WoW but I enjoy the game play more in WoW. I have not played dungeons/raids in ESO though.
---
Can you link a source where I said never?
---
See this right here is what makes classic wow the best game in existence. People always say it's old content you will get bored of it. It was never about the content it was about the relationships and bonds we created with the people of the game. The game is only a facility for what we really love about the game and that's the people. I love you all.
---
Dualsub on a low pop realm.

does mages have slowfall in classic? i joined the game late vanilla and cant remember if i used them during vanilla or tbc.

I hated him until I found out he is just playing a character which makes the whole thing more entertaining.

What reputation bought gear(not crafted) is BIS for which classes? Main question is if I want to minimize reputation grinds across multiple characters, what are the class/crafting combos that make the most out of a given rep?
---
Do you prefer PvE to PvP? If so, if you pass on humans' Diplomacy, you will regret it.
---
If you prefer PvP, Stoneform is useful in a few situations.
---
Hey I totally agree, I think that’s what I was trying to say I might have not worded it right. I was going for more of a “we can agree to disagree” kind of thing. Because it is totally a personal preference and I completely respect people who enjoy the way gearing is these days. That’s why I love that they finally made Classic a thing. So people who want things the way they were before can, instead, just have the before lol. 
---
For the record not everything in retail is bad though. I think mythic+, even though I’m not a fan whatsoever, is one of the best additions to the game in many years. It adds an entirely new way to play on the same level as raiding/PVP which is something I never could have imagined happening.
---
When on a Twitch chat people just become the chat. I don't know how to explain it. It's a weird tribal thing.

Nah fuck that. I plan on playing til I die, the sooner the better.

As a new player, try not to carry me too much.
---
You lost 99% of us at no fapping.
---
Source?
---
I would say start with smoking. The others aren't as fun and are easier to quit when smoking is gone. Except fapping.
---
Damn. Which ones? I thought the level 60 ones were all capable of 10 since that is where you might actually possibly want it.
---
The game goes live at 3:00pm PST/PDT. Hope this helps :)
---
I'm curious what you're going to put the Nutella on.
---
Isnt that why were all here?

Could they have been more clear? Yes and easily. There is a reason armies use zulu time and 24hr clocks. Using that blizz could make just one post ex: 0100Z 27/08 works world wide. Alternatively use GMT.

The info on that one is trash tho. 
---
That build is horrible.
---
You could be the best at anything in the world but it won't matter if you don't show up to do it bud.  And what makes playing the most not a way to earn it?  The people who are the most dedicated SHOULD get the most out of the game.

I made an identical character but with an old worn face and white hair. We’ve both aged quite a bit since 2004.
---
It's won't be as common as you think to get shredded by people . Often times it can be avoided with a /wave targeted on them . 
---
I find it super hard to pick cause it is pretty hard to change once you out a few hours in . It's just more time invested really .
---
Tailoring has bags, blacksmithing has sharpening stones and skeleton keys. What does leatherworking have besides regular leather/mail equipment?
---
Me too! It fueled my need to create a small server just to play with it. Only me, but so neat.
---
"It was something they said they wouldn’t do". I appreciate English isn't your first language, but what else is this meant to mean. The same way you talk about the pandas being denied?
---
It doesn't unfortunately
---
I have a job interview in the AM, so im double stuffed with hype.
---
All we had to do was follow the damn deeprun tram, CJ
---
Simple question: is it tomorrow yet?
---
I did some googling and to my surprise you can already buy gold for classic, on servers such as incendious no less. What exactly happens when you place an order on a server that doesn't even exist yet haha.
---
1. See question 2.you answered it.
---
2. Pretty much yes!
---
3. Not really. You can run dungeons and stuff with your Guildies or you can use a guild as a way to just chat with people.
---
4. No.
---
5. Different guilds have different goals. There are social guilds, leveling guilds to help with group questing, PVP guilds or PVE/Raiding guilds. Not really a guild vs guild fighting arena although PVP guilds will often queue battlegrounds together.
---
6. Nope. Graveyard. Unless they are in your group then they can res you if they are a class that has a resurrection spell.
---
7. Join a social guild while you are leveling and just talk crap. If you don't like them leave and find another. There's no pressure to stay in a guild if it's not what you're looking for.
---
8. Yes. If you chat normally only people within a radius will have it pop up in their chat box. You can also type in the general channel which is zone specific. A party can chat with  each other without limitations on distance or zones.
---
9. For everything except PVP latency isn't usually too bad. I am in Aus and regularly play on NA servers without any major issues.
---
10. In this day and age I'm sure every guild will set up their own discord for sure.
---
Best thing when you are a tank is that you find so many healer friends in Classic :)
---
You’re wrong about almost everything lol. They are better than warriors at one thing and one thing only - having travel form.
---
A lot of our lives have changed since Vanilla! Hope you have fun and best of luck with the transitioning!
---
WoW Classic is one month old
---
There's not a lot of rep grinds but when it releases you'll want to have a look at AV. Rep unlocks a great quest / rep items.
---
Fahking horde freaks
---
Not really, this shows how a more popular at the time person got ignored because in his country they don’t listen to Kanye but Kim was more well known
---
As I said in my post I think it's 3 yards. So 3 yards longer distance to shoot but a deadzone of 10 yards instead of 7.
---
If you find that this game isn't for you, any difficulty leveling won't matter...you'll move on before you hit 60.
---
If this game is for you, you will spend so much more time at 60 that the time you spent leveling won't matter.
---
Don't let the difficulty of leveling influence this decision.
---
Almost, but no :(.
---
This is a pretty shitty comment to make *mod*
---
I played both back in Vanilla and if you're ok going horde, shaman is such a fun experience.  They are fun to level, their totems are fun to play with and windfury procs are super delicious when they happen.
---
Warrior is going to be better DPS but there are other DPS that are even better and there is so much more to the game than raiding.
---
Warriors in classic are super great in a group but much less fun solo.  They have limited mobility (no heroic leap for one) and  no sustain during combat.  That's not to say they aren't a great class but compared to a shaman, they don't have near the bag of tricks.  In classic, the hybrid classes have a lot of tricks they can use but don't really accel at anything which is why people say they don't get raid slots.  But, when leveling or in PVP, that bag of tricks can be super fun to play with.
---
best zone for a bank alt(Alliance)?
---
Bit of a straw man there. 1 person buying gold 1 time will make such a small difference in the economy as to be immeasurable. That is not the argument being made - you strawmanned. Having an economy where gold trading is completely accepted and unpunished will have a catastrophic effect on the economy and would ruin the wow economy.
---
You also don't seem to believe in economics if you think that my parallel to a GS economy is not relevant.
---
Not rly. You didnt count the queue. What if there was a 5h queue at 30m before launch?
---
The ideal case would be you queue into the server at up to 30m earlier before the launch, but there's no way to counter the queue.
---
You had those armor patches but they weren't all that great.
---
There's a Google doc floating around that lets you plug in your weekly estimated /played and calculates an estimate of IRL time to reach 60. If you estimate 40 hour weeks and push yourself a little, it roughly says you'll need 156 hrs, or 6.5 days, which is just under 28days irl (40hrsx4weeks).
---
And you can bet there's going to be hundreds of dedicated players that will invest that level of effort in the first two weeks. It's not even that much of a stretch of the imagination when you put a few numbers in line.
---
Getting it done in under 96 hours /played though, that would be impressive to me
---
Ooh! Good idea!
---
Took my old toon from back in TBC, gave em grey hair, and then gave him a fancier version of the old name. It's gonna be cozy as fuck taking the old boy back in time.
---
Yes I'm sure.
---
Just because you don't have access to the data doesn't mean you can't observe enough to reverse engineer an accurate meter.
---
It's like average speed. If you're on a bus, you don't have access to the spedometer, but by observing distance and time traveled, you can calculate the average speed quite accurately.
---
Oh yeah, gonna run around chucking spells at people on my priest. 
---
It's not much, but it helps.
---
I'm a new player as well. I hope we're able to get some answers these as well :)  
---
Have you figured out the class you wanna play yet?
---
So if it’s say 2007, they are asked in an interview if pandaren will be a new race in the upcoming expansion based on an April fools joke, they respond with “No.”

I’m working on a link for your toxic ass don’t worry.

who ever thought of marketing high caffeine energy drink to sedentary Gamers is a fucking sociopath

Only on RP servers pvp is more I play Shadow you noob! ;(
---
why would that be banable when it impacts literally nothing for anybody else but you, and in a purely cosmetic way?
---
Waving is a sign of weakness. The weak will be destroyed first. Time to put the War back in Warcraft.
---
I know first aid is an absolute must in vanilla but I am still debating on which professions to grab that won’t hinder my leveling speed but will also make some money because everyone is fucking broke in vanilla. Lol. I think I might go skinning and mining. You can skin all the shit you have to kill already for quests so you won’t be going out of your way, and you’ll no doubt come across mining nodes along the way too. Those 2 seem to make the most sense to me at the moment as a good balance of making money and not slowing down leveling the toon.
---
STV where dreams go to die. So many great memories!
---
Yee i know that question is a bit useless but maybe someone can inspire me 😁 i like both classes. Warrior is just brutal, smash, zug zug... And shaman is like spritiual and so mysterious.
---
I think i will go warrior and after 2 years.. Soo when i reached lvl 60. I will get a shaman to 60.
---
I didnt knew u can charge only out of combat damn. I liked the mobility u have right now in wow as warrior 🤔 maybe it wilm be to slow for me in vanilla and i will change to something else. We will see
---
Who’s cutting onions in here wtf
---
I'm just so happy I'll be able to play wow again where levelling is the game and the low level areas are healthy and alive. Retail has absolutely destroyed that.
---
If you plan on doing lots of pvp shaman is lots of fun. Shaman is really good at pvp. For the spec choice enhancement is great for leveling but gets really bad at 60, so after 60 respec into elemental. If you plan on raiding it might be hard for you to find a group unless you are resto.

Smelly Alliance!
---
&gt; Because in Classic you have loads of other things to enjoy apart from having the best gear.
---
Like what? 
---
&gt; If you want the best gear you do need to be the person with the most investment but not everyone is playing only for the best gear.
---
Then you'll be worse than others but handicapped because you lack the time investment. Which means you'll never catch up. 
---
PvP? Don't even bother. You'll almost always be at a disadvantage. 
---
Raids? Maybe if they have space for you, but you don't have good gear, remember? 
---
What else do you plan on doing in Classic aside from pve endgame and pvp content? 
---
&gt; In retail the only incentive is better gear, in Classic, that's not the case.
---
This statement couldn't be more false. In retail, gear is easily obtained. When I played in Legion, I would notice that my ilvl was actually super close to top end mythic raiding guilds (the big ones). 
---
I didn't play that much and my gear wasn't that extraordinary. 
---
What sets people apart in retail is not their gear, it's how good they are at the game. How coordinated they are at the game. 
---
That's not the case at all in Classic. It's the exact opposite. Most bosses don't have much in the way of mechanics, so the only area Blizzard had left to work with was gear. Getting the gear helped you to do the content. That's why there's so many raids that require specifically you to farm up resistance gear. 
---
I just...do you not know these things?
---
Hell yeah man, good luck! Get that job, then lose it ina a week in! Lol nah but for real hope ya get it dude.
---
Cause its a joke
---
Pretty sure you're imagining things.
---
Thats Somewhat deep. 
---
Good advice thanks.
---
Mage will be super easy to level up solo because you can aoe farm super easy. Mage tends to help a lot of classes with water and portals. If you don’t want to be a vending machine mage might not be for you.
---
Rogue is the ultimate solo pvp machine, however. Group getting destroyed? Vanish, bye! I had a lot of fun with rogue, but found mage to bee a bit squishy, and mages are often targets in organized pvp because of how squishy they are.
---
I would choose rogue. Dwarf rogue.
---
I would assume that since it's running on up to date engine, Blizzard will keep heuristics for literally EVERYTHING this time around
---
One of my best and longest time friends is a guy I met on WoW during Vanilla. We met randomly while questing in Dun Modr in the Wetlands. We’ve hung out in person a handful of times over the years, and we still talk. It’s amazing what genuine relationships you can find while gaming.

Good bot

"All I ever wanted was to study"

This completely made my night. My friend and i constantly quote this movie while playing Wow. Bravo sir. Bravo

Go back to retail
---
Definitely do it, hopefully you can time it so you get vertigo during your race starting cinematic

If you live in belgium you can borrow my spare laptop
---
Why would 85% of classic players disappear? I prefer tbc but I’d still play classic, too. Different experiences and they’re both great. All the tbc fans also play classic. You’re being selfish and delusional.
---
Make both. When you hit a wall with Warrior, whether that is level 5 or 35, switch to Shaman. When you burn out switch again. You will gravitate towards one naturally.
---
You guys think the deviate fish will make bank again? I remember it financed my normal mount back in the day...
---
no I originally played a hunter and wont be making that mistake again.
---
you get tired of not being top dps (except niche fights) and having to deal with the deadzone in pvp.  OH and ammo and pet food.  fuck that.
---
I was decided for months... almost a year. And everything is shuffled now
---
seriously if they don't fucking release more servers there is going to be a huge problem with logging ques and im going to be very upset

Yep frozen ones are legit. 3 minutes in mic. Amazing rice for what they are.

Farm gold and help with their lvl 40 mounts, help with elite quests that give good gear. If your goal is raiding together, getyour pre raid bis fast and run stuff like brd early with them to gear them up while leveling and make shure you have your needed items so you don't have to compete with your friends if you both need a drop.

Honestly fuck heirlooms. I was playing a low lvl human the other day just for fun and it ruined it. Imagine being a new player and seeing everyone else in this epic looking gear and driving around in slow mounts.

Yes. Through hormones. Its just the way that my doctor explained it. There is no transitioning to in between. I'm going until I'm happy with my changes and stopping really.

Most players would go to TBC, because that's the clear push.  It would be something like ~80/20.  If they did classic+, it would maintain almost every player, or at least more than if TBC were a thing.  As someone who loves classic I'd much rather move to C+ than TBC.
---
shit da fuk up
---
Replace "Gaming" with current/retail WoW and I think that is most points in this context. The majority of people playing classic will be people who have already played WoW previously or currently, not all but the majority. In comparison to what your average WoW player is used to (excluding the ones who have previously played classic and know exactly what it's like) all of these points might apply.
---
I definitely understand what you're saying in a broader view regarding gaming though.

I can’t fucking wait, that queue is gonna be sexy

Good idea until you realise his email address is argalath@aol.com

That's exactly my point.
---
You're just going off on weird tangents and it's very hard to understand, where did they deny ever adding pandas as a race? You said you were working on a link. I don't think you're trolling me, your English is just fucking terrible (apologies if it isn't your 1st language). 
---
I asked why pandas got hate and you didn't say it's because they're goofy, you said it was because "It was something they said they wouldn’t do", which clearly isn't true otherwise you'd have provided a source?
---
This. Vanilla is a very social game because you *have* to communicate vocally with other players. Just as you will find anywhere on the Internet, even here, some people are going to be rude. Don't get discouraged. The fact that this game is the original wow means it is nothing if not noob friendly. It's a fun experience everyone should feel welcome to enjoy.

I'll eat as much shit as I want mummy.
---
All PvP servers are always more horde. A lot of people who play Alliance hate PvP. I believe that's why you see so many PvE servers named after Alliance stuff. There's a bigger demand for PvE servers from Alliance players. Which sucks, but also makes our queue times and everything not as bad.

I hear the nax one's just the inside of trump tower.

But that's doing the opposite of what I said. Minimising enjoyment and maximising tryharding.

You will die from Mercury overdose.
---
Mmmm, mercury.
---
I'm one of the people who just enjoys Azeroth, would play retail even though the story went to shit but since the game keeps reminding you that you're missing out on dailies/artifact power grind, it's really hard to play it casually.
---
Vanilla is fantastic when it comes to this, can take it at your own pace.
---
Source is just my experience from playing expansion releases, I'll try find something tho
---
i’m not
---
If you are leveling solo close to launch then you probably won't have any trouble finding people to help with quests while your leveling so you probably will do fine and have fun
---
Back in TBC i was in a top end guild doing really well clearing everything up untill Sunwell came out. All of a sudden my GM and his GF had some issues and he more or less said it was over with raiding/wow since his life had taken a big hit and he was even breaking up with his gf/wife due to it.  
---
2-3 "?" years ago i saw that he was really casually playing on his warrior again and i just recently noticed he spent some real time back in wow again from his armory.   
---
Found his old mail when he sent me a link to our Illidan kill video and added it. Hope to see if he is up for some classic with one of his old guildies hehe.
---
The only advice I've been given by my mates who play is to pick whatever the hell I think seems cool/fun, download questie after the launch dust settles and just play the game.
---
Did you not read the AMA with the Devs from earlier this week or visit the official blizzard forums? Google is your friend, the sources are easy to find.

Dude yeah Stream it and post the link

He made it almost all the way to 60 before he upgraded.
---
Yeee the windfury procs are just juicy as fk 😅 i mean i could go warrior and just do mortal smash but thats boring isnt it :P i think i will find raidspots with shaman in like a fun discord group.
---
Which race is good for shaman tho?
---
I was adding onto what you were saying for any potential readers.
---
Oh. Okay. :(
---
Might be trying to install on another "drive" on your computer which could be the recovery partition if it's a premade computer. I would check the download directory again in the client just to be sure. Could be what's happening.
---
Faerlina is the streamer server. So your guild really wants to play with streamers probably.
---
I like it!
---
The only person implying forever has been you. 
---
I haven’t once in any post said, “Blizzard said they were never adding pandas” I specifically said in previous interviews when asked about upcoming races Pandas were denied.
---
It started as a joke race. That’s where the hate is coming from. Many didn’t feel like they fit into wow lore.
---
I'd prob go through that in 2 days
---
Hahahah this is awesome! I was cracking the fuck up at “nostalgia players 1st dungeon” cause I know sure as shit that’s gonna be me
---
They arent just open to it, they will be doing it up to wrath.

you mean, ready to turn off the monitor and jump in bed pretending to be asleep because my guild raided after my bedtime? maybe i should get my mom to call me at 10pm just to tell me to go to sleep haha
---
This may be a silly question, but here goes: if I start playing on normal wow, will that progress be transferred to Classic wow or do you need to do a completely new character? I'm thinking about doing a trial period.
---
I think it's important to remember that you only ever hear of the negative things. Why is that? Because negativity sells. The media gets the most clicks from covering bad news. Companies and corporations want you to believe you have a ton of problems so they can present their products and services as the solutions to those problems. Politicians try to present themselves as solutions to problems too.
---
Every year the world takes several steps forward, even though it may not seem like it when you look at the news. For example, 50% of the world is now middle class. Only 10% of the world is living in poverty right now. Those numbers are insane compared to just 50 years ago! Illiteracy is plummeting down, average IQ is rising, equality and democracy are being established, cures to diseases are being found, the amount that people give to charities is increasing, countries are investing more and more in green power sources (India is going to be powered 30% by *thorium* reactors soon, how cool is that??), etc, etc, etc.
---
There are many issues that won't solve themselves, I am not denying the negative things happening. But if you're a realist you will see that in general things are getting better globally. Global warming is our biggest threat right now, but we are moving in the right direction to solving it - we just need to do it faster. That's a global project that our generation will have to take care of. 
---
If you care as much about the world as I do, please do not look upon your fellow humans are stupid jokes. Have empathy, cultivate understanding not division. We're all in this together.

it's not as black as white as you want it to be.
---
There's a huge economic incentive to be "first". You get access to endgame resources earlier with less competition. You also have much more gold (spending power) which is magnified when you're "first".
---
Simply put, being "rich" in the first week might take 1XX hours of effort, but if you try to achieve the same level of wealth months later, it would take maybe 3~4XX hours.
---
It's much easier to start rich and become richer than it is to be poor and try to catch up.

“New classic” doesn’t even make sense when used together. Not even talking about WoW, it’s just an oxymoron.

I’d quit classic+ because I don’t want classic+. Whether or not there are tbc servers. I’d go find a private server to play classic.

We thought so too, as 16 year olds ;)

See you in Classic!

By "support" you probably mean healer. In Classic that's priests, paladins, druids and shamans. This might be a good place to start: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/class-guides
---
how about we put another macro or whatever into the game that we can manually use before we level up to adjust the camera angle. for the next quest turn in or the next mob we fight.
---
We can gurantee to always have the same camera position with some human foresight^^
---
It's a joke really, an actual mythic+ dungeon would require a tank to be way better than a tank in a dungeon in classic, even more on the fact that there's a timer in mythic+
---
It isn't even close to 80%. Maybe against undeads when you try 200% more than other players. Go look at logs. Even the top rets do basically 50% of the top dps every fight.

---
&gt;What are the general dos and don'ts? Does it matter which race I choose? Can I do something wrong at the start which will f\*ck my gameplay at a higher level? (wrong skilling for example)  
---
&gt;In other MMORPGs I loved to play support... what is support char and do you have tips for it? Is it very hard to level with support char? Is it easy to find groups as support? Horde or Alliance... does it matter what makes more fun?

Trash leveling guide. Every leveling guide leaves out the best part as alliance.

If your not Night elf (fuck leveling with a guide and fast) Goti darkshore. Gain Darn rep and when your 60 get a tiger mount. Everyone's going to rush following these whack ass guides your going to be missing things like this. Oh I rush to 60 now let's get me bis gear. Or take your time and do other things and get more out of it.

Agreed. I stopped reading after that.

 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWHYTSQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_-L3yDb3RQAPMG
---
It has very similar specs to the other one I linked you but with less storage. It uses the same chip as the other one I linked you for processing and graphics. It's an integrated graphics card, but it does more than enough for wow and I've played perfectly fine without any issues on it even in current retail raids from time to time. You won't run on max graphics, but just above MEDIUM graphics is fine for wow. It can also run most other PC games on at least the lowest low settings at a playable framerate.
---
The one you originally linked is great for general gaming though. That would do much better for anything other than wow that might be more demanding.
---
But for wow either of these are great

So, in practice, it's the same.
---
its good to realize that this is wow classic not actually vanilla wow. everything has changed. this game is solved. to many if you arent min/maxing you aren't playing.
---
We can gurantee to always have the same camera position with some human foresight
---
we jsut need to know the exact duration of a level up animation so we can divide the screenshot timings. Come on lets make this happen :D
---
Pretty good list
---
To be honest I'm looking forward to raiding with people who haven't done it before. It's such a great shared experience and unlike anything else I've done in life before. Just be up front and honest, ask people for tips and they'll definitely help you!
---
Holy shit I forgot about this video
---
I played WoW in 2006 on a 2006 base model white MacBook so I wouldn’t worry about a 2015-2019 mbp!
---
That was the cutest poem :) see you in Azeroth!
---
A great idea, my 2 cents. 1, if it is chaos with a lot of people, it wont be enjoyeable. 2, when you do take mushrooms the part of your brain that operates the game, will usually stop functioning, and it is VERY hard to play. This comes from experience and what i've seen with friends.
---
Try it!
---
Cmon Blameyou, you're making us look bad!
---
Yeah that laptop is awesome and I'm sure it would be fun to have, but if your only games are wow or Minecraft then a cheaper laptop with a ryzen 2500u or 3500u and Vega 8 graphics is plenty.
---
He did the original proof of concept where they ran the original vanilla assets on the BfA client. It proved to Blizzard that they could viably run and maintain Classic on modern infrastructure.  Without that, the project would have never been green lit.
---
Just wait :)
---
I'm not the one doing it, but anyone that thinks Joanna of all people is going to be a meaningful measuring stick is going to be *very* surprised on  Thursday or Friday.
---
What does that mean
---
Blizzard: "Avoid servers which are high or full."
---
Yes thank you! Trying to get at least Friday off, have a 4 day weekend to no life the game!
---
They are.
---
Need.
---
There is the "World" Azeroth where the term is widely used. But there is also the subcontinent Azeroth. Together the subcontinents Lordaeron, Khaz Modan and Azeroth are the continent Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Also the Kingdom of Stormwind was/is also called Kingdom of Azeroth prior.
---
I don't think anyone was asking to support it but the point of the question was for me to understand yea
---
No way. Nothing like showing up like a clown and being able to dissect what everyone is wearing. I loved walking into a big knowing I was gonna get fucked by mr.bigdick in T3
---
lol... on my server horde was like 10 percent to 90 for alliance
---
2 hour av queues for them instant for us.. we actually had our premade go up against a premade of the top alliance raiding guild with AQ40 gear
---
it was an interesting match that we prevailed after like 2 hours of a stalemate... a quarter of the horde side were warlords/high warlords with about 2/3rds being part of a raiding alliance i was with that were wearing bwl/zg gear.... 
---
honestly we never expected a 15 man turtle in the back to counter our 7 man rogue/druid stealth squad 3 boomys, 3 rogues, and 1 resto... we were used to rolling and doing 15-20 min av's
---
On what basis? Untamed has a strong proc, but it's 11 dps behind Ashkandi. And I can't imagine this proc happening more than once per minute.
---
Converting the 11 dps into AP, without the proc Untamed is essentially -240 AP compared to Ashkandi and +360AP with the proc up. So, you basically need 3 ppm just to make it even.
---
Getting ganked while trying to farm that bullshit.... hours wasted doing those quests.
---
What is the best way to level your weapon skill up after changing to something new?
---
Also is it a good idea to buy a vendor weapon to get started? (Specifically talking about going to swords as a rogue)
---
I don't know why you're downvoting me. I'm all for it. It's just that a large chunk of WoW's playerbase aren't the most savvy when it comes to dealing with transgender issues.
---
When did they say they'd never be added tho?
---
Sure is. I have uni at 9am tomorrow so I'm going to be in the computer lab playing from 8am. Hopefully will get to level 5 by then
---
Indeed
---
Will be tough. Im pretty excited. Honestly will be hard to sleep tonight. Kinda like being a kid on Christmas Eve. Best of luck to you!
---
I'm gonna come home from work, power nap and start the journey at 1 am.
---
Found the neck beard that lets a online video game dictate their happiness in life.
---
Nah, but I have just been so happy and euphoric on them I was thinking it would make for a great trip home, no pun intended.
---
dont bully me i was very high
---
For any teenagers reading this: mushrooms are, in fact, drugs, and some people can have adverse reactions ("bad trips").
---
Says the same person who would have a few glasses of alcohol.  Enjoy your trip.  I tried to game on lsd with destiny 2.  Shit was a bit crazy.  Ended up just chillin and listening to music, going for a walk.
---
Obviously this is fake, druids don't wear helmets in cat form.
---
No shit.
---
Well what did he reply?
---
Dude I'm not trained in therapy; I don't know how to help you break free of this way of thinking.
---
Blizzard has deliberately created more content than can be consumed in any reasonable pattern of consumption, with options for parallel and intermodal progression. YOU. ARE. NOT. SUPPOSED. TO. DO. ALL OF IT. This is not Pokemon. Do not catch 'em all. That is not a healthy mindset.
---
afaik they said they are open for several options after phase 6 including classic+.
---
one source for example:

---
I haven’t done this in a long time but I think what you need the rep for is infinite dousing. Earlier on you get one-offs so you just need multiple people on the quest.
---
Because this post is part of my story. Not others I wanted to share it. Also I don't really need validation. Not sure where you got that from. I posted where I'm at currently and I'm proud of it. Other people don't have to care. I'm happy that you even took your time to come here and share your opinion. It made my day that much greater that I am now a part of your life to in even the smallest of ways.
---
Nice build dude!

[I'm running these. Definitely scoop some up.](https://www.newegg.com/deepcool-rgb-350-multi-color/p/N82E16811980001)

Same for me. I suspect we have to install the retail client and log in for the characters to be reactivated to show in the forums.
---
*laughs in Son Of Arugal*
---
Leveling is really slow, not all of it is because the traveling. It would be false to also not say there is quite a lot of traveling though. For me? I enjoy it, sort of. Sometimes I get impatient and it can cramp my mood for a little bit, but a lot of the time the world is just cool to be in man. You run into people while running, friendly and enemy pvpers. Especially when you have to pass through a higher leveled zone! It gets dangerous and fun. It is very much a game that will require you to go to quite a few locations to level up. But the journey is great man.
---
Dont let the haters hate, we the true meta
---
That's pretty casual but stilll acceptable.
---
Couple of months ?
---
What are you, speed leveling ?
---
my shadowpriest had this face.
---
He'll need to do his level 10 pet quest in NE area. After that though he can make the run to SW.
---
There is a hunter trainer in SW, think in the dwarvern district? Can't remember, haven't been alliance since the first few weeks of vanilla :P
---
This meme of level 61 greens replacing naxx gear has gone too far, tbh.  People were using naxx weapons at level *70* for christ's sake.  Yes, questing greens in outland were very good but it's dishonest to say you replaced everything the second you went to HFP.
---
Depends on what you consider issues I guess, and how many positives there are to outweight the negatives. If we're talking bugs and glitches then yeah, vanilla definitely had plenty of issues. If we're talking about design philosophy then it's about different tastes really. If we're talking class balancing I don't really see vanilla's approach an issue really, just a bit poorly tuned. And so on so forth.
---
But naturally anyone that have fondness for how vanilla handle thinks are going to point fingers at retail and say it is full of issues, and vice versa.

This chart also reveals the inherent Horde V Alliance problems in Alterac Valley.

I definitely didn't help
---
Is there like a mad obsession with death with the younger generation?
---
Skeram &amp; Stalagg. A man of culture.
---
Haha it could definitely be worse, I just couldn’t figure out where to change it. Didn’t realize it was called the lock screen.
---
So there's literally no other method.
---
Yeah, skipping through some guild posts I found a lot presenting themselves as semi-casual or even casual, but saying that they expect their members to be equipped for raiding by mid September. 
---
Most people will be finishing their leveling and running first dungeons at that point.
---
Free?
---
warlocks have underwater breathing so they don't need the potion
---
Probably just meet up at level 12 or something. He will lose out on reputation needed for a mount if he starts out in Elwynn
---
Gonna be rolling to the store for the resupply.
---
Ya it's all some complicated stuff that's why my general feeling on that subject is is it hurting me? Nah . Hurting someone else ? Nah . Fuck it whatever then lol
---
shhh we don't need more tailors early on xD
---
I’m with you.
---
They mean ”skipping” as in going straight to Rag, not ignoring the raid for the entirety of Classic. It was worded poorly.
---
Huge please for a Horde version ;)
---
I’ve always enjoyed watching movies when tripping. Never played anything on shrooms but on LSD I have and it sucked. Been eating regularly lately and it’s been so euphoric, I want to see how wow is.
---
It's not about not getting good gear. Good gear is always fun to get but you don't need the best gear. I'm not looking to rush to the latest raids. I love the rest of the content, which I feel is lacking in retail. 
---
It seems that for you being the best is what you get enjoyment from. That's fine for you and fits perfectly in with the retail experience. I don't feel that pressure in classic as the journey to 60 is a lot of fun. Gear is part of the equation but not a major driving force for me. Definitely not raiding or grinding PvP. 
---
The social aspect is also huge for me. I enjoy running dungeons and getting to know people. I love getting together with friends and doing some world PvP. I can't seem to do that in the current incarnation of live WoW.
---
Jesus Christ. Don't be this dumb. There are quick ways to farm the rep.
---
I like H20
---
Woaaah oh black Betty.
---
Micro dose, enough to feel something.
---
Hell yeah bois!
---
Can't wait! Literally :D
---
Currently at work - gonna get home - get some Shopping for tonight done - go to bet from 7:00pm until 11:30pm and then play all night :)
---
Just to be ready to work again tomorrow... &lt;/3
---
Smart man :)
---
This is certainly not the majority of cases whatsoever.
---
Same here! According to OP, people might be worried. But I think we'll all be fine :)
---
I am in japan and will be back the 28th
---
Hopefully won't be so bad as I will be going or already in bed by time gates are opened (midnight for me here in EU)
---
What does the white one taste like? Just had the red and yellow sugar free ones so far.
---
Yeah thanks, I know gnome has the edge with the racials but I definitely prefer the way humans look and cast. I also much prefer a horse over the mechanostrider
---
I know im going to be playing in...what....15 1/2 hours (assuming im time queues right), but it still hasnt really 'hit' me.
---
...Which is odd since its currently 1:30, my alarm goes off in a bit over 5 hours, and im not even tired.
---
This is a weird damn night.  Granted, sleeping way too late today on accident+dealing with some financial stuff is fucking up the sleep tonight as much as anticipation....
---
How much Orc reputation am I missing out on as a Tauren leveling in Mulgore rather than Durotar?
---
If everything goes as it's currently expected to it will be under 3, which means they will only need to sleep once, or twice at most. It'll be less than a 10 hour gap between real hours and /played for the first batch.
---
I'm not the one doing this, I'm just hearing from up the grapevine what's happening in practice. Anyone that thinks old times like Joanna are even marginally relevant is going to be *very* surprised on Thursday or Friday.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
Tonight at midnight
---
I hope the account got banned. You have to it down zombies even if they look like your friend man.
---
Who cares anyway, any spec works perfectly fine for classic content even if healing or tanking
---
It doesn't mean anything. The files are not encrypted. You just can't log in to be able to interact with the addons yet.
---
Is it currently working for horde? =)
---
Good work. Looks decent
---
No no, you say “ding” and I am required to say “grats” or the old gods will force me back into retail.
---
OMG victim blaming he didn't ask for it &gt;:(
---
Heaps good. If you want your cheeks clapped meet me at Redfern at 7am.
---
No onion or relish? Madness
---
Why? What do you mean?
---
When I played vanilla on sargeras, there was a troll rogue. His name was strife. Strife terrorized red ridge. His weapon of choice on the low use; gun.
---
I'm thinking about rolling Shaman or Druid. Allways played prot. warrior and tanked. 
---
Not many Shamans or druids in this thread. 
---
So Tauren Shaman or Druid for me :-)
---
Do you enjoy traditional rpgs with stat building and customization? If the answer is yes, then you’ll like it.
---
The endgame consists of 5 man dungeons, 10 man, 20 man, and 40 man raids for PvE content. Whereas the end game PvP is usually killing people out in the world or fighting in battlegrounds (capture the flag, hold objectives, kill the enemy leader) 
---
Typically to participate in the 40 man raids, guilds ask 2-3 days a week of 3 hours each during progression. 
---
Characters in WoW are server locked. 
---
Feel free to DM me if you had any other questions.
---
indeed! My old uni!
---
Damn, that's wholesome.
---
EQ has like 30k subscribers and they still put out expansions and new progression servers each year. Games like istaria (has like 20 active players) and anarchy online (few hundred players) are still running.
---
 But when WoW has 2mil subs it’s dead. People are dumb.
---
There will be plenty of PvE on PvP servers. It may slow you down slightly while leveling due to getting ganked or choosing to level in different locations, but it'll be fairly minor.
---
It is not already? We already experienced world of mobile app craft with garrisons.
---
well honestly.. you can have a raid schedule... just doesn't need to be crazy..
---
i mean on my old server due to a lot of us being in college or jobs but wanted to raid -- i had raided with 3 different clans (my own) and two others on weeks/rotations I knew i wasn't available for ours, i ended up getting all the gm's/officers to meet up and setup a signup page for raids/ we ran raids throughout the entire week that anyone could sign up for... ended up getting us to the first few bosses in nax with a casual/friendly atmosphere...  
---
then BC came out.... and everyone thought they could do a full 25 man raid by themselves with only having 15-20 reliable people and ending up with a stalemate... god i hated the chaos that created....
---
Yes , I want to kill you
---
Pretty sure I raided with some people who did in vanilla.
---
I've never played before. And I did look at some guides beforehand, but nothing like a levelling guide. I watched some videos about cool quest items you should keep, some profession stuff, something about hunter rotation and pets. But nothing past that. I do want to be a noob, but not completely helpless. I probably would have missed professions entirely, as a Night Elf I would never make it to Stormwind to level with my friends. Missing some of these vital pieces of content is really something I wanted to avoid.
---
Do you think I stripped myself of a lot of the experience? In my eyes I just saved myself a lot of hassle.
---
Hellll yeah brother!
---
#didntgetthejoke
---
That high effort meme got removed at 47 updoodles in under an hour. I’ll take shit memes over 
---
PSA: Don’t forget you’re playing with REAL people! Try to be nice!!

any day of the week.
---
plz look at the first sticky post of the forum
---
Ah, thanks brother I was curious about that
---
I'm making my character a lot younger :)
---
No one is bragging. It’s entirely possible to eat mushrooms without considering it ‘drugs’ or bragging.
---
For some people psychedelic experiences are common, I’m not an edge lord because I want to eat some shrooms. You should probably get over yourself.
---
I feel
---
Gotta agree, the first content patch of Cata counting both the raids and the dungeons I generally had more fun than I did the entirety of ToC and ICC. The problems started appearing more for me after the heavy raid nerfs (wasn't it like a 20-25% nerf?) and going forward with Firelands. Though for what it's worth, I'm impressed and will give them credit that they managed to incorporate the base concept of "fire" into so many different mechanics in one raid.
---
Pretty much all of it. You’ll need to turn in somewhere around 1-2000 runecloth after going back and completing all the quests at 60.
---
Saddest? Lmao if he swaps the some tuna with other protein foods this is perfectly fine, other than the junk we see here daily.
---
Well he is blind.
---
I was wondering why it would be an obvious spring picture
---
You dastardly upside down antipodeans!
---
neat a tub.  can you flood the sub with more shit we won't care about?
---
I feel like people didn't get the reference
---
Wanting to do challenging content isn't the no life club,if it is you admit by your own words that current sucks because only way to get a challenge out of it is by no lifing it(which it isn't you can just do your dailies once every 3 days). Also i don't care about seeing the content i want to play it. I'd just watch youtube videos if i wanted to see the content. Its free too.
---
I’d assume so, it was the last line.
---
i remember the pre-BC patch when that list was topped by FELGUARD  
---
jesus christ, them AV battles
---
on digital clocks it'll say 00:10 etc instead of 12:10.
---
different story on analogue clocks

Well Im hoping you can leave work pronto and get right on. And your queue times will be short! (But we are all hoping that)
---
*worse version in comments*
---
Their experience already is miserable
---
Once you hit the character screen you're past the que , sooooo yeaaaaaa
---
Nice! I’ll probably have this on my second monitor. Thanks for sharing! :)
---
No Mountain Dew? No monster?
---
lol 12 hours a week was the raid schedule for my crew from bc-cata
---
basically... willing to accept any specs if player had a basic knowledge of a good spec/rotation
---
stayed at number 1 on the server until got fed up with high school drama crap from adults -\_-.....
---
Hard to say if you will enjoy it, but I think it's worth trying, especially if you think gameplay/community is more important then graphics. I used to play rs classic back when it released and swapped over to wow vanilla sometime during rs2. Main reason was the group content.
---
I'd say its pretty grindy, but that depends entirely on what your goal is. It's nothing compared to maxing an rs account in the old days.
---
Endgame is doing raids and pking
---
Classic wow will start with 2004 content running on a 2006 patch, while releasing the content inbetween overtime. I think?
---
Servers are unique so you cant hop between them with your character, the only interaction you will have with other servers is in pvp battlegrounds.
---
&gt; buy a vendor weapon
---
The only memorable thing I've done in retail over the past few years was the Challenge Modes back in Warlords of Draenor. Even the Mythic raids nowadays don't really leave me with any feeling of accomplishment.
---
Supply and demand. It's going to sell for a fuck ton
---
I heard fortunate son in my head before even clicking the link
---
Underated comment.
---
arcane mage
---
I’d easily wager at least 51% of people playing classic played bfa. It’s likely higher. I’m not hating because I’m in the same boat. I think there’s a large group of folks who buy every wow expansion and at least play the first month or two.
---
You'll be able to log in before launch , go to character select screen, and wait to press "enter world." It should light up when it's time. Queue occurs before the character select screen though so length will depend on when you log in and how many other people do, when etc.
---
So is Alterac /s

Not gonna lie ... this shit pissed me off so much when I didn't play a hunter.

Then I tried playing a hunter and realized how easy it is to forget to dismiss a pet.  I deserved all the yelling I got for that.

I don't even fully get the joke and found it to be funniest next to Molten Core.

I call these types of people "Sand Castle Kickers" as they are incapable of creating anything of value themselves, so they spend their time trying to ruin other people's experiences.

I get off work at 4 so sadly I'll be waiting in these dreadful ques.
---
Reminds me of the time I bought an account from some dude just to realize that he recovered it a few months later, thinking I wasn't using it anyway. And then he tried to talk to me about Jesus Christ and his epiphany he had during that time due to some accident.

Anyway, I got my money back. Damn religious psychopaths.
---
Private servers use a similar client to the original 1.12 client from 2004-2006. Classic runs on a modified version of the Legion client. Classic addons are not ocmpatible with the original private server client. If you only have a couple addons, it shouldn't be a big deal to tweak them after you get in game intially when you go through the other game settings.   
---
   
---
There was mention of a specific server/client replica of the classic version for the purpose of testing addons. However, I believe it was found to have malware in it. I would probably just stay away from that.
---
The real question is, are you feeling the downvotes?
---
Only gank when you finish your quests first.
---
This is true. If I'm not mistaken, I believe the amount is 0.003% maximum that can stay rank 14.
---
Charlie make sure you don’t go homeless
---
Imo, hunters are the king of world PvP
---
In my opinion, it is pretty huge. Even though only very few get to complete it, it is an event that is about the server community. I am not able to quantify the effects of server transfers though, since I am not Blizzard and also haven't done any data collection.
---
There are also economic effects from transfering between servers with higher/lower population or inflation. Pick Black Lotus on a server with lower pop, then transfer and get rich on a server with higher pop, for example.
---
Personally, I think servers should be 100% discrete and self-contained worlds as well. They should have 0 ability to impact each other (except for Blizzard initiated server merges, I guess). Materials and characters there not created on the server should not exist on the server.
---
&gt; honestly your logical abilities are astounding.
---
You just said no one cares enough to argue with me when people have literally been arguing with me....and with you here literally arguing with me... LOL
---
You should probably just stop typing at this point
---
Sounds promising! Do you have a long term plan?
---
What’s up with those pizzas - are they good?
---
"You fucked up the quote you dingus... "

lot of debate about that addon and might break after Blizzards response to it. I wouldn't count on it.
---
Chorizo breakfast burritos with caramelized onions, tomato, roasted red peppers, lots of that chili garlic Sriracha saucy saucy, and cilantro. Forgot the black beans!
---
What? The WoW community never voted on actual content polls. In OSRS they literally poll the smallest of things. If they did similar polls in Classic WoW, the jaded boomer community would never let anything that resembles retail pass, so don't worry about that. 
---
If they never add anything to Classic (after all the phases) it will become a dead game very quickly which is what started happening to OSRS till they took the route of making significant updates.
---
Well, I'm not going that crazy.  The next two Tuesdays off and most nights I'm sure.
---
Will be leveling slowly, though.  Smelling all the roses.
---
This is my point, you can only sit on that character screen for 30 mins. SO lets say 2 hours before launch there is a queue of 5K and a wait time of 2h 25m. Great, if you join now, by the estimated time you will be on the character screen when the button goes red. Time it wrong, you get booted from the character screen moments before it goes live and end up in a new, 4 hour queue.
---
Lol, imp and succubus are on there.
---
Sir, 24 hours a day isn’t casual
---
I still have that whistle and its OP! You can summon the doggy and take the trinket off and keep him, and he even scales to your level!
---
I don't like that idea. Classic was all about oportunity. Someone only needed a healer for scholomance? I mean, I want to go to Strat... but this is the faster way to get anything. And by this way it was much easier to get groups up as not everybody was only looking on BiS lists and only going to the dungeon they "need". I want to read what people look for and decide to do it or don't. Maybe it is only Maraudon, but I still know the tank from SM so... You know what I mean? AddOns don't work that way and that's a pity.
---
Are you claiming time is ‘odd’? I get classic on the 26th not the 27th....
---
Incendius. Feel the burn.

Bad meme. All it did was make me sad.

Why would you need beta alanine playing wow?!

Ya. And it's a little nostalgic since these are the pizzas my friends and I would get at the PC cafes back in the day.

Right, cool, both drugs.  Both should be taken with some precaution.  
---
That being said, I’ve never heard of any of my acquaintances having bad experiences with aspirin.  I’ve heard plenty of stories from folks who had a bad trip on mushrooms, however.
---
Totally downplaying any potential downsides to drugs just leads to people having bad experiences on drugs - usually people who shouldn’t have taken them in the first place.  Being intellectually dishonest certainly doesn’t help destigmatize or normalize healthy drug usage in the broader scheme of things.
---
Fucked if I know. But I do know that we have about 60 members that want to raid on a regular but casual basis.! :)
---
Might try it tonight then, thanks for your quick answers! May your login queue be short!
---
I personally enjoyed the balance TBC brought to the game. I don’t like flying, dailies etc.
---
Does remaking a character avoid the afk kick? and does the afk kick reset your place in queue? or should you just alt-f4 and relog to avoid the afk kick?
---
Will there be a server reset? maybe... did you really want to wait in a 10k queue to find out?
---
Can someone explain "gains" to me? 
---
I guess it's literally just gaining weight through eating and working out so as to pack on muscle the right way?
---
I always thought it was weird how some people eat so much and also work out, isn't that counterintuitive?
---
Not that this is what OP is doing, those meals look amazing!! I'm just a total health and gym noob and dont understand how it all works.
---
Damn dude you just encapsulated how I've been feeling all day. The anticipation has been so immense, and seeing a community of people all sharing the same fervor has made me feel like I'm part of something truly special.
---
This isn't to say that I think this excitement is going to die off anytime soon, in fact it's going to keep growing over the next few weeks, but I can't help feeling a bit meloncholic closing this chapter.
---
Tfw people realize cooking is maxed by lvl 30-35
---
Off course! Just give me a sec!
---
I was expecting a poem
---
we likely will never hear them from blizzard unfortunately.
---
LSD mommy.
---
Yep, been up since 12am it is now 7:54am, been here just browsing reddit. The hype is real now.
---
Reverse balding, nice
---
If you havn't tried it yet, make sure all your browser security is off.  I run a bunch of blockers and privacy stuff and it was doing the same until I allowed the bliz sight as trusted.
---
Right, like the reason you restart The Office after like season 7....who cares it just sucks after that, just go back to where it started and enjoy
---
I think it's just the retailshitters that take themselves too seriously deciding to hop on the Classic-bandwagon
---
Well I hope you get a great imp Name!
---
Literally is! I have no plans for a guild right now, just going to level and hopefully fall into the right place. I’m genuinely excited to find out who my new friends are going to be.
---
Preparations have been made decades ago. The wheels are all in motion. Time to fullfil my destiny.
---
I think you meant to say 1-60 is faster than 1-99 runecrafting
---
My main was a SP, if mana didn’t suck I’d say it’s relevant healz all day long.
---
It´s THE ultimate journey. I leveled like 7x lvl 60s on pservers. Yet I am still hyped to max for this official journey.
---
You can have a bad experience on both. Be careful, and respect both of them.
---
Hahah
---
We actually have a lot of muscle chef meals for dinner/lunch! These are just snacks 😁
---
Isn't hardcore casual more like playing a few hours a day but only doing things to progress your character (no fucking around etc) ? :b
---
ahh so cute ;w; 
---
I wish u all a happy and super fun Time  !! &lt;3
---
Guys, Classic is out tonight at 11pm but because of queues and work in the morning I likely won't get online. My girlfriend wants me to visit her after work during the week, what do I do?
---
Doubt the streamers themselves will, it's good content for them and plenty of H vs. A events that can happen when you have people who can create large groups.
---
I'd be 100% expecting many fans to just settle on other servers though.
---
an unfortunate side affect of starting fresh.  all servers will likely have a decent balance at the start due to everyone and their mother wanting to try classic.  once they weak are thinned from the heard and guilds start forming will we get a true read on what server pop will be in the long term
---
Bad meme, mass death of animals caused by humans is not funny
---
This is not the common image of a WoW player and it’s blowing my mind. As a semi-health nut, this is inspiring. Saving this once I finally get an oven (new gpu for classic comes first)
---
Wow coincidence I just made a bunch of tuna salad a couple hours ago.....though I used 4 cans for some sandwiches over a few days interspersed with other meals. You have a bit much there....
---
If you are looking at the American realm lists, are you able to see the Oceanic realms (Arugal, Remulos) in your list, or is there a properly separate region for Oceania?
---
Yeah really though
---
Well done. Well done !
---
this is like the third version of this i've seen
---
Yeah, that's kind of my plan, I'd rather be 30 mins late then miss the window and end up being hours late.
---
It's going to be a gamble for sure tho...
---
Get so hammered that you lose track of time.
---
From AMA:
---
&gt;**Q:** What are the plans after Phase 6? More content for classic or moving to TBC?  
---
&gt;**A:** We’ve done most of the hard work by bringing back 1.12 so progressing to Burning Crusade would be a lot easier for us. Our plan is to identify everything we need to do should we ever decide to go this route. We want to be sensitive to the desires of our players. Some may want BC and some may not. We’ll be following the Classic community closely to help determine what our next steps should be.
---
&gt; **Q:** Considering the nature of WoW classic and why people love it, would other tweaks to things that the vanilla community dislike be on the table? Examples: No LFG in Wrath, undoing some blatant, unneeded homogenization in patches, or possibly an ilvl squish in TBC and Wrath so that old content is not marginalized? 179 
---
&gt;**A:** We’re looking into what would be required to support BC and WotLK should we decide to go that route. The guiding principle for WoW Classic was staying faithful to the original game.
---
It’s less clear what our direction should be with BC and WotLK. As you point out, it is likely that some features of these expansions will not be universally embraced by the Classic community. We’ll be following player progression and sentiment to help guide us in our next steps.
---
They'll all be full tomorrow and the new 4 they launch a couple hours before launch will probably be high as well lol
---
Spell batching is quite different since it is when the server handles spells (to reduce network calls), so any spells queued for an opponent within up to 399 ms on Classic will be executed at the same time, whereas in Retail this windows is around 16 ms.  
---
Grace period, lag tolerance or spell queue is the time you can press and ability while it is actually still on cooldown or GCD and make it go off as soon as it can which is to help people with bad connection to the servers. So a 400 ms SpellQueueWindow means that when you press a spell, as long as the cooldown or GCD is lower than 400 ms, the game will queue it up and it will be executed as soon as it's ready.  
---
Essentially, SpellQueueWindow is the exact opposite of spell batching in that it's a tool to help player hardware rather than Blizzard's hardware.
---
probably yeah.
---
I'm talking about the fake troll post that was going around that was photoshopped and said tldr: "bear threat is mega nerfed In classic...."
---
Which one are you talking about?
---
If I burn myself out of Classic, I will be going homeless again. It’s fun and I save a lot of money.
---
Server discord
---
I'd give you a gold but Reddit is stupid
---
MCing them out of tower windows never gets old.
---
This is so true. I never ever ever understood the "I have no time for classic WoW" reasoning. It is definitely the most casual friendly version of the game. 
---
Pros cant exist without casuals :)
---
why???  I literally just added this site to my bookmark yesterday.
---
I'll have you know that I spent an hour doing daily and world quests in Nazjatar yesterday, and used all the pearls I earned to buy random Benthic belt tokens, but none of them rolled a socket, so I had to scrap them all.
---
Maybe tomorrow I should sacrifice a lamb to RNGsus before logging in, or something.
---
&gt; They're just gonna FORCE me to log in EVERY DAY or else I'll be BEHIND!"
---
&gt; This argument goes back all the way to vanilla beta. Blizzard came up with rested xp to help casuals keep up with hardcore players, and hardcore players lost their fucking shit saying baseline XP was a punishment created to penalize "loyal" customers.
---
Those two systems have the opposite effect though.  Rested exp is made to compensate for not logging in and playing as much.  Dailies are made to try to get you to play every single day.  You're acting like dull, repetitive, "engagement-increasing" dailies are a gift to casual players when there are far better solutions to the 'playtime gap' that actually involve activities that players enjoy.
---
now that's what I call fuckin' YIKES
---
posted it a second ago but it got removed because the account was brand new. so i copy pasted it again on an account i had sitting around that i forgot about. but this is OC from the inside of my dome. inspired from a facebook post earlier in wow classic community.
---
Hardcore then transition into Casual after you separate yourself from the rest.
---
Respectable.
---
EU here. Woke up at 1AM to switch my schedule for classic, with intention to go to sleep at 3PM.
---
I feel so wired I'm starting to think I will not be able to do that in just 6 hours.
---
initially not much, around 30-75g to help buy a mount, most others wont buy it cause they just bought a mount or saving for a mount.
---
Which realm that isnt full are there swedish peeps on?
---
I'm pretty sure /i just begins "instance" chat.
---
Hes not wrong, spellcleave gets you to 60 by friday, rag down by saturday at latest. There are like 15 guilds going for it, no way it lives past saturday.
---
Threat and mana management is more serious business on horde. No salv or free wand mana with wisdom judgement. Pots are your friend, and a good tank is worth their weight in gold.
---
Then Casual-Hardcore.
---
it's like 2 days max for 95% of people until they go back to normal lmao chill out.
---
It's going to be a huge problem no matter what at this point unless you're willing to roll on one of the brand new servers. The damage is done
---
&gt; i use 10-12gb
---
No dude, Windows is reserving that. It will automatically reserve a certain % of physical memory if available regardless of capacity. If you don't believe me open Resource Monitor and look yourself.
---
Even with a bazillion apps open (and Chrome *alone* hogging over 1GB among its dozen child processes), my rig is still using [less than 7GB.](https://i.imgur.com/qFPrBzP.png)
---
If you only have 8GB, Windows will not only reserve less, it will tell apps to adjust their caching as well. WoW isn't going to gobble up 2GB of system ram, anyway. It's the VRAM caching that would get saturated, depending on the resolution you're playing with.
---
The number of RAM channels (2x4, 2x8) is more important than the capacity.
---
Why not both?
---
can we please fuck off with this karma farming bullshit, thanks
---
Stinkiest breath in all of Azeroth

The only undoable quest are  breadcrumb quests, I recently made a list of those type of quest.[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cukd01/list\_of\_breadcrumbs\_quests/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cukd01/list_of_breadcrumbs_quests/)
---
I'm no doctor but the food on the middle shelf looks unhealthy
---
I am going to play 5 hours a day. Sometimes will take 1-2 day off from gaming... Weekend will be 12h played. But still will catch your full hardcore ass :D This is not casual sir.
---
Nah, I didn’t think you did. Figured it was some reddit mod or bot. And, Tbh, I don’t care how you identify, that’s fine, be yourself. Agree to disagree 🤷🏻‍♂️. No hate, just a difference of worldview, and that’s fine. We’re all here for f’ing classic and I hope you enjoy the fuck out it like we all will. Ishnu alah
---
Playing a dwarf priest too on Arugal! I’ll keep an eye out for you tomorrow and say hey!
---
I don´t understand the wish to rush through classic. It´s not like you can achieve something for the first time. 
---
I compare it to rewatching one of your favorite TV Shows. You know what is going to happen but you recognize a lot of things you didn´t see the first time you watched it. Just like in the movie "The naked gun" - so much is going on in the back that you don´t notice watching it the first time.
---
That´s what I can´t wait to experience with classic.
---
My bro you are going all in..there is no Casual in that post lol :D
---
my rogue got CHT and Perdition's in one MC run  
---
was a good night  
---
awesome story OP
---
Trinkets won't be out phase 1 so wotf is alot stronger. Idk about phsse 2
---
Seems fake.
---
yes, only once per month
---
How is it hardcore if I’m making alts and messing around?
---
You would then sell them on the Gadgetzan AH, no? I remember our palas complaining the Horde were pricing it too high.
---
Theres 2 tabs, United States and Oceanic.
---
god blizzard is fucking dumb
---
That would be a crazy good steal. It would be worth picking up even if just to resell down the line.
---
Sorry I should have phrased my question better: Was the deleted comment you replied to from one of the mods?
---
America here. Those Oceania realms are on a separate tab at the bottom of the realm selection.
---
In current it does. I don't think there is "instant chat" in classic, though.
---
High Quality.
---
My pc begs to differ :p
---
I want to believe it's real, but yeah I think it probably was staged. The kid is a great actor though, real dedication with the remote there
---
Just a heads up, siphon life is 30+ :)

Mircoloft I'm sure
---
they could make 10 more tonight and every realm would still be full. There is not nearly enough servers
---
Oceanic has it's own tab
---
that is how time works
---
That is good to know! Thanks.
---
Thank you.
---
I think I just underestimated how important food is to muscle growth.
---
What does a good healer need to do for you? It's been ages since I last played WoW and I have forgotten so much.
---
You’re going to want to level as enhancement and stack AGI and STA as much as you can. It’s ok to wear leather if it means better stats when leveling.
---
Attack rotation is to start with your lightning bolt, then flame shock, then either frost shock if you need to kite or earth shock if your mob is in the middle of casting something. Save your earth shock for interiors and frost shock for kiting. Flame shock should always be casted first to fully take advantage of the dot damage.
---
As always, have windfury enchantment on at all times.  Before then you’ll just have to work with either rock biter or flame tongue.
---
Don’t forget to purge and to use different ranks of heal for spot heals to be more mana efficient.
---
Once you get into the groove of it, you’ll be able to chain pull no prob.
---
Same. Digiorno is too greasy and, dare I say, runny. Red Baron either classic or thin crust is the best freezer pizza money can buy!
---
I used to play a warlock originally. Going paladin this timeso pretty much the opposite.
---
1 hour a day for 7 days in Vanilla WoW is enough to grind your character to 60 in a year of soloing, but you'll have to ditch almost every dungeon that isn't Ragefire Chasm. Vanilla isn't casual.
---
WoW beta had a drama shit storm because Blizzard called base xp 100% and rested xp 200% , and people went absolutely mad saying this was a conspiracy on Blizzard's part to cover that they were dealing 50% xp penalties for playing more than they wanted you to play. WoW players are fucking crazy.
---
I know this 'cause I'm one of 'em. I did not finish FF8 because that magic system made me fucking nuts with the compulsive need to fill 999 of every magic and stay topped off at all times. I was "trained" in video games by a guy who told me he card gamed Squall's 2nd highest weapon before even getting Ifrit. I was taught to be nuts.
---
You can be nuts in Vanilla. If you want to be fitted for a straightjacket, all you have to do is try to grind rank 14. You can spend 5 hours of prep to save a half hour of raiding. You can get Thunderfury Rivendare Fishing Tournament Macaw Admiral Hat Winterspring kitty Timbermaw Scarab Lord yourself. If you have the time. But if you only have an hour, you're never gonna full clear BRD.
---
You don't have to log in every day. See my replies to the other guy.
---
There is no instance chat in classic. That is called parry/raid/bg
---
For now just loads of 'hahaha's and smiley faces. I was expecting a war cry.
---
Very insightful, thanks man!
---
They'll all be full tomorrow too
---
Have the devs talked about classic+ at all? I just remember them saying bc would be easy to transition to
---
I feel like making alts and not working towards any specific goal can be considered casual.
---
Had problems tonight where my computer wouldnt boot up, and after opening it up, though that my motherboard or power supply was hosed and almost had a heart attack. After a while found the slightest loose connection somewhere and it booted up.
---
So I kind of know your pain, and sorry your luck wasn't as hot. No way to run on your CPU integrated graphics?
---
Better rename your char Cholesterol..
---
Pathetic. Take sick leave like the rest of us
---
Supply / Demand - its too early to put a price tag on it.
---
Don't think there is any casual realm. If you want to have a bit more mature servers with a nice pop, not too high, then zandalar tribe is your server.
---
thank you, but what about the time ? at what hour ? i heard that they would reset the servers before launch ?
---
It's 100% staged
---
Oh shit, I used to have the "original gankstas" shirt when I was in high school. Completely forgot about that
---
Considering it's blizzard themselves that told us to expect a lot of queues it's not unwarranted to expect long queues.
---
Legion and BFA releases can't really be compared to this because of different server sizes.
---
I'm not sure, but I'm looking for that vendor too.  I heard he sells the sausage roll recipe.  All my Aussie mates are telling me it's required for leveling.. something about +10 spirit..?
---
Anyone have a good resource for where to quest? Horde undead mage
---
Faster looting? Why? We already have auto loot, we dont need it any faster than that..
---
Fuck, I've played this game before.  It's a little easier when you're the healer and you can withhold heals until they switch it back.
---
funny thing about classic is you have to actually ask and talk to other player.  I know crazy but its true.
---
Is this able to do /played right before taking the screenshot? Would be cool to see my played time each level.
---
\+6m? dude its a 400G staff max 650G. Where on earth did you get 6M?
---
Yeah you could really fuck yourself lol ,  I don't really remember that being a thing ever before though so maybe it is some type of weird preventitive thing that's only temporary till launch either way gl
---
&gt;whats everyone planning to do while they wait in queue?
---
I think im gonna watch twitch - seeing all those streamers doing the exact same will somehow be entertaining for me :)
---
You're not wrong, just saying it's the only possibility :p Skipping Ony entirely makes about as much sense as playing the game blindfolded after all.
---
how did you get this picture of me

A Junkrat player I see
---
Pretty much. I want to see if I can make it through 48 hours off launch. Girlfriend is going to bring pizza and wings as the day(s) go on. (Totally didn’t take two weeks off just to play...)
---
Just call in sick, like I'm planning to.
---
idk, i'll fix it as I am in queue tomorrow
---
Don't worry, I had some strange random bsods since the beginning once a week which I thought was due to settings. Is a faulty one since day one.
---
Bro, just drink lemon water, green smoothies, go for a run/walk/bike/gym and in a week you will feeel like a new man.
---
I quit smoking like this and the first few days were hard( Thinking about rolling a fat doobie up, cant fall asleep, feeling down.. Things like that) The lemon water kept me "fresh minded" and the exercise with proper diet made me feel tired in the evenings and fall asleep like a baby. Your dirty habbits stary to fade a way and your rooms suddennly look better and you are motivated to do other things than get shitfck stoned and degrade on the pc/tv/console.
---
Hope it helps, gl.
---
It's been a long long time since I played an mmo launch that felt like this, most mmos now a days you get a mount pretty early on, and aren't incentivized to join a party until the "finder" becomes available. The next few weeks are going to be pretty fun.
---
The comment section of the video has everything time stamped.

Tfw when you make another alt to level it all over again.

Parry chat.  Must be the warrior chat.
---
I think arena would've been way better if it were a timed event so it didn't take away so much from world pvp.  Balance changes could come in classic+ too, and maybe even resemble tbc balance
---
You’ll be just fine. Just be sure to drink at LEAST 16 oz of water for every rockstar you drink. 
---
Also, I hope you’re ready to take seriously unbelievable shits. You better have remote access or a laptop, because you’ll be spending a good amount of time in the restroom.
---
GG WP
---
There isn't a lot of competition for a lot of druid gear.  But it's balanced by needing so many different sets of gear for different things.
---
Yeah in BGs your damage will be slow.  You will play support. Even if you're not resto spec.  You'll be carrying flags,  guarding nodes, stealth capping lightly guarded points or helping a rogue do so. In general no matter what spec you'll be keeping enemy rogues out of stealth, rooting melee, sleeping hunter pets (or other druids lol), interrupting casts, stunning, innervating, battle rezzing, buffing rezzers with motw/thorns, curing rogue and hunter poisons/blinds, decursing warlock curses and yes, healing, even if you're not a healer.
---
And you only had 1 hour of attempts so there was that added stress/pressure
---
If ya ain't the first to kill good old Ragnaros then you may as well be the last.
---
Orcs - standing there all hunched over with their mouth hanging open like idiots. How about you zugzug these nuts.
---
Honestly relatively few people will get to play much on the launch days. Most folks will have hour+ waits to get in, and when they do things will be hard to get done between lag and saturation of players all doing the same quests. 
---
There is also a risky servers have to be taken down for emergency maintenance, and issues affecting login servers seem likely. There will probably also be DDOS attacks just to pile on. 
---
It might be worth taking a nap just to roll the dice, a few lucky login clickers will get in, but if you see a big wait just do something else or go back to sleep and just add it to your sleep savings.
---
I’m guessing late Sunday hours or early hours on Monday morning. With all the people, it’s guaranteed some top guilds will have stragglers and fall behind. The biggest thing holding guilds back is the aquals. Will be a tight race that’s for sure.
---
Yeah those all look as nasty as they should.

"The odds of winning the lottery are extremely low"

Horde for life
---
I am at work, not doing work
---
In central europe it‘s actually rather „the day before Classic“ as it launches at midnight today. So I’m going to go to work and then I’ll just have to kill the ~5 remaining hours. I‘ll find a way to do that.
---
I had the exact opposite experience in Vanilla! 
---
I just joined the best raiding guild on the server, Awakening on Emerald Dream, after being in the best PvP guild on the server. I had seen up to Major Domo in MC and downed Ony, but never killed rag. I was decently geared for how far progressed the server was and knew 2 people in Awakening so they were pretty happy to take me as a trial. 
---
The guild had a strict policy though. Being basically the only hardcore raiding guild on the server but also hard up for dedicated members they were very up front that trials did NOT get loot. They had too many people join, do 1-2 runs they after getting 5-8 epics would go "thanks guys but my bros made a new guild and imma join them, cya! and ditch. I was fine with the rule until I watched FOUR pieces of Lawbringer get disenchanted the bracers get get aside for another Pally who was offline. I got to see my first Rag kill though, which was nice.
---
The next day I joined a guild group doing a DM Tribute run that involved two officers of the guild. All four people were very encouraging to me saying they were super impressed with how I did the night before and apologies about the loot rule. I said it was fine. But it kept coming up that I really overperformed from expectations. I wasn't top of the healing meters or anything but my over healing was very low and I was top of the cleanse count for the night. Well this DM run because two hours long as it turned into an impromptu officers meeting that ended with a slight change to the loot rules (trials could get 1 epic if no one else needed it) and me getting promoted to full member as well as mailed the Lawbringer Bracers from the night before. It was good validation even if I didn't come out geared to the teeth.
---
Exact same position. Still can’t wait for launch tho.
---
Damn mate
---
Came here for WoW hype
---
Got me some good recipes.
---
Can you heat those buritoes ?
---
You're overstating the difference between America's per capita GDP and most European countries though-- it's nowhere close to two times theirs in most instances where making reasonable comparisons (as you claimed in your deleted comment)
---
Plus, their comment was an actual criticism of a real problem that was on topic-- your comment was the equivalent of "lol Europoors BTFO"
---
Because again the standard of living between the average European citizen and the average US citizen is extremely close. Especially when you consider that America is likely more top heavy than those nations in terms of wealth and income (and I'd be curious to see the median int$ comparison rather than a flat per capita rate)
---
Does this guy not know what meth is?
---
They'll do it once or twice in DM/WC and learn like we all had to.
---
Honestly the best tip I can give is just to play and enjoy yourself. 
---
Basic tips would include just try to save you money for mounts at lvl40. Don't train every skill from the trainer as it gets expensive and plenty of skills aren't that great. Always talk to the flight path people so you can travel around easier later. But yeah that is it. If you have specific questions I can do my best to answer or if we end up on the same server I can point you in the right direction in game.
---
It’s a bad ass game that is hard! But not hard in a way that you need to spend time to do your daily to farm a specific currency to have an item.
---
Hard because the environment is hard. When you arrive at level 60 (and even before) you have plenty of things to do. There is no real “perfect things” to do to max your toon. You will have ton run plenty of different things to max your character. Lot’s of freedom overall compared to retail, imho
---
The only difference between casual and hardcore is time spent playing.
---
I have went back and fourth for weeks. Spending hours watching YouTube videos and reading reviews. My heart told me to go druid as I think it would be a blast but I always wanted to be useful so instead I’m going to hate life and level a warrior.
---
The server situation is only going to get better over time.
---
if I was in your situation, id be tempted to sleep and get up at 4am or something
---
&gt; They can't just add new things to classic or it wouldn't be classic
---
Not true at all, in fact we all wanted emerald dream and kharazan but never got it.  I could see them putting in more end game content and all the other goodies that we wanted back then.  What WOULDN'T be classic is going to TBC.  That would kill classic, and no, all the stuff I was describing aren't unique to TBC.
---
I've got a strong feeling that for some players this will be one and the same.
---
IIRC we took 2 weeks on Razorgore. Vael we blitzed in like an hour.
---
PS: fuck the suppression room.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvfc76/i_made_a_really_simple_addon_that_automatically/ey479fe/
---
Yeah, I'm gonna be nice sometimes,  but I have no job. I'm playing that game to have fun, end of the story.
---
If you open WoW from Twitch app instead of Bnet launcher, it doesn't auto log you in. Also if you get booted or back out of char screen you have to type it in.
---
So it's the same as Europe has it with the different languages?
---
Would be weird if you can't log in for that time... Hyped up on redbull, staring at a queue timer.
---
Then you finally log in, enter the world, run towards the first quest giver and [get disconnected after 3 steps](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/ktcUyw6mBlMVa/giphy.gif).
---
It was so perfect with the fire.  The imps would always mess up the unorganized pugs.
---
I just think going to TBC would create a much bigger rift than C+ would.
---
Lok tar Ogar friend!

Yeah you're probably right.
---
Same as the different languages are in Europe? Each language has a separate tab.
---
That's optimistic, lol.
---
Either way, they could still repurpose expansion content for C+.
---
I gave up on the rep grind to get into Naxx and just waited for TBC. I didn't have it in me then to grind up again.
---
Something like this would be an awesome addition to an addon like VendorPrice.
---
Are you new to youtube? People usually just watch the videos, rather than first expanding the comments section to see if there are *instructions* on how to best view the video...

I was about to submit my vacation request, but then someone on my team quit. Now I have to work :(

I could walk out tomorrow and die in a car accident. Which probably happens every minute around the world. Can't avoid it.

But, but, I am playing on a laptop.

Isn't it 18hs ET (So it's EDT this time of the year), not EST? So I'm pretty sure it launches 1700 EST.

Horde for live. Would you change your grandparents just by a cheap opportunity?

I've been doing some in-game betting on world firsts for a while with my guild in retail and its actually a lot of fun to speculate. 
---
In this case, there isn't as much information as there usually is regarding guild compositions and preparation.
---
I'd predict Sept. 1, Sunday for the WF Classic Rag kill.
---
That being said, I think there is definitely a chance its before that. I'm just assuming some hiccups along the way. I also predict it will be an Asian guild as the Chinese scene for competitive raiding is still quite strong.
---
Guess #1: Asian guild Sept 1
---
Guess #2: EU guild Aug 31
---
I will just play tomorrow after work and skip the 10 hour queue...
---
Don't skip sleep for waiting in queue.
---
Thanks for the write up! I'm interested to see how it will all play out. I'm always a healer and in almost every xpac I've hated healing for druids but that's a personal thing.
---
Really? By our estimates 1-60 shouldnt take longer than 60 hours. That leaves plenty of time for sleep and hydraxion rep for a saturday kill.
---
I believe they said you can log in to create more characters at noon PST (may have been CST I just wrote noon), launch will be at 3 PST.
---
Well, g\*dd\*mn\*t, she already warned you after the Anthem launch... you need to learn: the toaster is a kitchen denizen.
---
I'm having a bit of trouble on deciding which class to play. I want to play a class that is a bit more involved than just spamming one spell (which I read is classes like Mage and Warlock). I was thinking Rogue, Hunter or Shaman as they seem more involved, but I'm not too sure. In your opinion, which class would you say is very involved when fighting?
---
Thanks
---
Can you eat all of those before they expire in your fridge?
---
Why is it a problem to be in the character select ? Blizzard stated that if you are in the select the "enter world" will become available as soon as "launch" happens. so it seems character select is exactly where you want to be 30 mins before launch

Just make sure it is a newer model that supports Metal API. My buddy has a MacBook Pro that ran retail great, he tried to load up classic and it's a no go for classic and the new retail. Real kick in the balls, he had to run out and buy a new one.
---
Doing them in a raid group makes it impossible to complete quests.
---
Exactly the same your logic is sound
---
You wouldn't want post-naxx content?  Lol.  Everyone back in the day wanted Kharazan/emerald dream and who knows what else.  It's not too crazy to think they could do it right.

With TBC the 1-60 leveling experience went to shit.

“Some random guy your buddy vouched for” god this is so true
---
He probably used up the rng of everyone in the entire game that night, which is most likely the reason my bis items never titanforged for me in the last expansions
---
Ive played maybe 2 days of BfA and i'm rolling a warrior, so long friends.
---
I met a guy that happened to live about an hour away over WoW. One of those times where you're discussing random things in real life and they mention something familiar to you and you're like "wait, you talking about by the Exxon and Footlocker?!" and realize you've been online friends with someone damn near in your neighborhood for over a year.
---
A mutual friend opened up the movie theatre he worked at after hours and we watched *300* together 2 days before it released. Great memories. And that dude was a beast of a shadow priest.

Love it! it's so good
---
delete the pron folder
---
Honestly not a bad idea. Hope my girl doesn't mind (computer is in our bedroom).
---
Clean your room!
---
F mate.
---
See this on the bright side, though. You won't be in absolute traffic with thousands of other players on earlier zones when you come next week.
---
That's my take on it, I won't start playing before next Sunday ;)
---
Go ask this question a chess player
---
What is hype, baby don't gank me
---
Don't gank me, no more
---
And in some cases you'll just look like a box of crayons exploded near you.
---
I can't zoom in on the full size image, it just goes blue
---
... and dont forget the many, many, many DPS wanna-be-best-friends either!
---
Now you make me even more sad. I'm free of work untill Sunday...
---
Thank you! Yessir
---
They are you Will just see the pricing go up 30c Per item.. worked in the beta :)
---
And those servers died and nobody even remember them anymore
---
Don’t worry about that nonsense you are doing exactly what plenty have done before with instructing to use the time stamped links, Good video, does what you said it does. Thanks for the effort.
---
lmao is this a play on Orchid?
---
I'm just here to parse wtf the title is supposed to mean?  It makes no sense...
---
I used to do this all the time... Too stupid.
---
Vodka and energy drink got me drunk good and kept me going, was my thinking back then. Probably scraped a few years off my life expectancy.
---
Right I agree, in the end we should always appreciate our loved ones, even when you have the most heavy arguments.
---
Thanks for clarifying that you're the guy on the right.
---
Marry me..?
---
I'm doing this as well. Not employed right now, so I have the luxury of time.  I intend to play an insane amount the first two weeks, take an IRL roadtrip sometime after that, then play a lot until I find employment in my new city.  
---
I would like to level quickly, but not power level.  I'm rolling pve so I can experience all the content I missed because I was tired of being ganked.  Maxed professions FTW!
---
Onion cutting Rogues
---
Lol ded gaem
---
When my alt druid on another server hit lvl 58, my guildies asked me if i would like to join them in bwl. I was one of only 2 druids, they needed me for buffing, innervate and rezzes..
---
I got my first Tier 2 item with lvl 58. Was quite of an escalation in /1 as it was the second week where the raid even was out.
---
Well atleast we know one person who isnt going to hit 60 then.
---
Good luck bro! I hope work is solid today
---
Its been an honour getting hyped with you my friend.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Lol what
---
you are asking if drugs ar bad at /r/junkies

I could have  sworn they were because they didn't think it was worth putting in the effort to recreate the old restrictions on the vanilla mail system.

Also reported the ad when I saw it on another site.

Just go see her tomorrow. Wow will always be there. Don’t sacrifice those moments with someone in your life who loves you.
---
Top top, this is why Ret Pala are the best DPS! Spread the word!
---
I played it on a $400 HP from 2003 with a 14" CRT. You'll be fine.
---
Saying 1-60 in wow is faster than getting 99 runecrafting in rs is like saying the Earth is smaller than the Milky Way. Literally anything is faster than getting 99 runecrafting.
---
Thank you for the informative reply.
---
I’ll be giving a lot of stuff away for free, but will also be an AH Goblin. It’s difficult to know if I actually will end up with more or less gold than the average player
---
Its wrong so yes
---
I'm changing factions so no :p
---
stealth away all you want ... i'm /chickenening out on a PVE server slow-leveling. Ill meet up once the BGs start instead.
---
The problem with your argument is you seem to be forgetting that we already had classic. And it already had people buying and selling gold. The economy wasn’t ruined until Blizzard ruined it themselves. Gold sellers had nothing to do with it.
---
And those Paladins were BLOODELVES.
---
So yeaaa,  that's a child predator

No way it's not staged. It's so ridiculously exaggerated and inhuman that it's impossible to be real. Also, when the younger brother leaves the room in the beginning *without missing a step, like if on cue* the rager enters without acknowledging his brother in any way, it seems very artificial.
---
But even then, it's just fun, over the top physical comedy that I never thought I'm gonna see again in my life :D An oldie but a goodie.
---
Nah mate they're probably already full of adrenaline right now. It's gotta be amazing to launch something like this.
---
I was like that for weeks lol. Finally settled on Shaman.
---
I never got why dudes played girl toons.
---
I'd say they have a strong chance. There used to be plenty of Asian world firsts back in the day.
---
In the most recent raid on retail, 5 out of the top 10 first kills were Asian guilds - 4 being Chinese. On retail, NA has a 1 day headstart over EU, and EU has a 1 day headstart over Asia in terms of when the raids / patches are opened. I'd say with a global release they have a much better shot than usual. That, coupled with the fact that Vanilla / Classic a very well known game with simple boss fights could mean that things get out of hand for the first kills!
---
To add clarity for UK people, it’s 11pm on the 26th (tonight), midnight for the rest of Europe
---
You’re raid ready my friend.
---
thanks bud
---
How do you handle these? Do you freeze them? Just curious, I tend to prepare meal for the whole week, with breakfest always handmade every morning, but lunch made in one huge bulk of goulash, or any meat with spices and sauce to prevent it from aging for enough time to finish it. I would like to prep mealboxes like you but not sure how to keep them fresh
---
Wish there was a way to play this in rhythm bot in discord
---
I played on a Pve in Classic, you can’t get killed when you do not activate your tag, so when you quest the only griefing that can happen is by stealing mob. There is still world pvp Because people organize raid on cities and if you want to be attacked you can activate your pvp tag. You can exit pvp if you have enough of it.
---
I’m probably going to roll pve again since the pvp server for French seems to be fulll
---
These are the connections that brought back classic WoW
---
No, the odds of winning the lottery are still extremely low.
---
True, if you wanna fuck and make money, do it. I prefer to do it at the goldshire Inn personally.
---
I enjoy the upgrades as you lvl. The items. The spells. But i also enjoy the social part of lvling. 5 mans are some of my favorite content. I try to run all of them and multiple times just for gear and fun.
---
You could play on intergrated graphics. The classic graphics setting can be played on a toaster.
---
...whitemane is a regular PvP server right? ....what the stereotype?
---
Alright ty, so I don't need an addon for that :)
---
A launch will be something unique and unlikely to experienced again.. if you don’t have a job or school tomorrow, try to see for yourself imo :)
---
Good luck to you too, bro! Hope you‘ll find some sleep so you‘re rested for the adventure!
---
The sad part is that my vanilla brain sees the warrior on the right and thinks daaaaamn son, ready to go with that sexy prebis!
---
Those were actually my first ever epic. Yup still remember.
---
They're resetting the servers before launch so anyone trying this is getting booted anyways.
---
The AMA covered this. Just start logging in "minutes before launch" according to Blizzard
---
First few weeks only i guess (hope). Then they either have left or learned not to do that, as well as that the CC buttons actually serve a purpose.
---
YES THAT IS IT THANK YOU
---
also I might of maybe a long time ago and forgot again lmao.
---
no prob
---
That make your healer go bald from stress?
---
I don’t think that means what you think it means.

When world server opens will one have to refresh realm to be able to join or will the button get clickable automatically? That seems like it would be important to know as well.
---
Same here. College courses have just started again, not looking forward WoW ruining it for me. Gotta stay mature and reasonable.
---
That is heavy.
---
Savage FFXIV? Oh you mean that content that most recently had all bosses downed on day 1?
---
Probably, but I'll freeze most of them.
---
Not even close to fancy. Id say minimalistic ☺
---
save your gold.  don't even look at the auction house until your max level cause unless its to sell something cause i'm guessing that's liable to be a real shit show at launch.  take some time to grind crafting skills.  production skills are good for making money since you can sell mats you find but like i said the auction house will likely be bit off at the start so maybe hold on to mats for a bit.  other than wasting your gold there really isn't anything you can do wrong per say
---
Not for long.
---
Go to a major city (Orgrimar for Horde), and watch or post on the chat for LFG (it won't take long)...
---
Note: you actually have to run to the dungeon after you group...

It's not about the framerate, it's about the ergonomics. It's significantly more enjoyable playing on a desktop computer with proper peripherals

Lol yea. Trve Skeramo
---
Well it is about 7-8% proc according to wiki. And as horde 2 hand fury it is a bit better. Cuz everything proc Hoj and wf while Hoj/wf + everything let you proc the on hit effect. So having 3 proc per minute isn’t hard. On top of that as 2 hand fury AP &gt; weapon dps( cause Bloodthirst). Ofc if pvp/arm/alliance untamed would be best.
---
Rogue has a combo system in which you work to use filler skills to fill up the combo points and execution skills which uses the built up points to unleash massive damage or do something else.
---
Hunters have pets which you need to micromanage.
---
Shamans have totems and shorter spells which give you an advantage depending the situation.
---
I can understand the stereotype behind Mages and Warlocks being spammy, but they too are involved in their own right and can do about killing things in multiple intricate methods.

The dungeon, Ragefire Chasm is in the middle of Org. You're likely not going to get a run to Deadmines. There is a quest and teleport that takes you to Gnomeregan, if you want to go there.

Nutjob with fucking awful music is what he is. You are fucking delusional to think otherwise. Lfuckingmao...
---
Someones jelly :)
---
I have a feeling layers are sub servers. and theres way more then the normal 3k players per server.
---
The "problem" with Classic is that there is very little reward for putting in little hours. Droprates are lower, reward structure is based around long term commitment and everything in general is slower.
---
One hour of gameplay in Retail nets you more rewards and "positive feedback" than One hour of Classic gameplay, heck, you might take an hour for a single quest in Classic if the Droprate RNG is not on your side.
---
THats what people mean with not having enough time. Basically they dont have enough time to achieve something of value to them.
---
I chose this server without doing any research just because it wasn't 'full' or 'medium' and it's PvP which is what I want to play. I wouldn't be shocked if many landed on it the same way as there aren't other options with High PvP. Rather they're all full.
---
This is me. 8 days of hardcore then back to casual.
---
most likly, but still a few hours before, so you can be on the char screen
---
&gt; First off: see = play. 
---
Have you done lfr before ? All fights are reduced to tank and spank and you can ignore almost every mechanic the boss has. Thats no more challenging than just opening up my browser,go to youtube, then type in the newest raids name on the search bar to watch a video. 
---
And regarding your second point i am nowhere close to cap and i dont care about getting there either. Im still sitting at 424 ilvl which i got pretty slowly too. Im not playing 10 hours a day to get everything maxed up or some shit. But at the same time ill get bored if i never push m+ or do nornal pug raids. I like playing games where i can die when i make a mistake, that doesnt make me a hyper hardcore gamer. And if i don't do dailies i won't get to do that content.

---
There is no benefit for you as a priest whilst lvling  but you say you wanted to do it to help him so it's all good I guess.
---
But melee in optimal groups for fast dungeon clears at 60 prefer shamans over priests due to windfury and str totem. A shaman is every warriors best friend. Whilst casters on the other hand will suck priest dick for power infusion. :)
---
It just boggles my mind to see so many players planning to rush 60. I just hope they'll be the minority so I can enjoy the leveling and not get ganked by bored 60s.

Warrior dps pre raid bis is half leather gear, especially with lion heart helm taking a while to surface, you generally want the hit leather gear that rogues will also be searching for.

 Eg - eye of rend, mask of unforgiven for head, truestrike shoulders, devilsaur gauntlet/legs.

---
Alliance has favoritism in AV through map design.
---
Yes! I did this with a buddy originally. Here's something you should both consider. **Gear!** Both Paladins and Warriors use the same gear so you need to make sure you both understand this.
---
I recommend letting the warrior gear up more since that class is more gear reliant.
---
that info shows, isp is getting to much control in the eu
---
So much effort to prove us all wrong... For nothing
---
Ouch
---
Is it working for you? Its not for me, but maybe itll work at launch
---
We were all noobs back in 2005 dude
---
Daily quests ruined MMOs for me.  Games felt more like chores once they became a laundry list of activities that needed to be completed within 24 hours.
---
It's never a good thing when you get home and get even more tired thinking about the dailies that you still needed to do before going to bed if you didn't want to get behind.
---
Thank you for the non-douchebag reply. Very henpful.
---
It wasn't until TBC that leather working could do leg and shoulder enchants, right?
---
Yeah, I checked some videos of my guild during BWL and noone used damage meters.
---
looks like no one knows
---
/cringe
---
It's funny  because it's true, lol. I can't stop giggling about it.
---
Actually they didn't "simply announce" the 27th, the announced a worldwide release. The reason they say it's the 27th is because A) it will be on the 27th for faaaaar more people than it will be on the 26th, and B) It's a lot less hassle to say the 27th and have all the clueless people from the US be relieved it's releasing on the 26th for them, than it is for them to announce it as the 26th and market it that way only for clueless europeans/asians etc to think they'll be able to play on the 26th.
---
Basically, the details of the release has been known by basically anyone capable of googling it for the past 3 months.
---
R u mad?
---
I filled up my fridge with quick easy meals but did not meal prep. Guess it isnt so bad to have a reason to take a standing break to cook.
---
Fuck that dude. I'm playing 30 hours on launch, so I have to do 15 hours of this CCC to make up for it? Not a chance.  
---
I have a sit/stand adjustable desk. I'll stand for 30 minutes every hour and call that my CCC balance.
---
I care
---
I care. Anyone wanna tell me what stuf I should get?
---
Only if people take the hard route for the Hydraxian quest chain to even call him.
---
And even then there would have to be enough people at 40 so I really doubt it.
---
It takes few months to get pvp gear as well.
---
Thanks ya'll for keeping me busy at work ... the whole time really.

Oh dude there are at least 20k per server with layering, absolutely . Removing layering will only add long queues if there are still massive amounts of players playing, yes. In Vanilla servers were capped at 3k or thereabouts, I expect server cap powt-layering will probs be a lot higher, maybe nearer 8-10k, so queues might not be so bad.
---
Man, seeing these "LFG to play 24 on launch, then 18h a day" posts all over the community discord are really something.
---
DingPics sounds like a pedophile website rofl.
---
Launch is at 11pm my time, I’ll try and play for a bit but I’ve got an early start both tomorrow and Wednesday, both shifts also going on till 8pm. All in all I’m not gonna be able to play much until Wednesday night and Thursday, hopefully servers will stabilise by then.
---
Yea, I hope Blizzard addresses it in the future.
---
Perfect edit 10/10 ridiculous shoulder pads. Very wow.
---
Like YOUR mom did to me last night. LOOOL rekt
---
I hope i can even log in at this point.
---
Herod has the best chance of an active community 1 year down the line. I'd rather wait in queues now and benefit later.
---
Man what a cool idea that was. “Okay let’s put a dungeon he-“ “Wait, no... let’s put... FOUR dungeons here.”

[Here is him introducing a non front shredding rotation before he even describes what front shredding is.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tcs6FkhqxI54jR4miD0eytsjZJ1YWYO6PzEjKMdnTJk/edit#slide=id.g44acb759f0_4_148)

---
He does the same thing in his Rogue guide.
---
In his Paladin guide he offers both Reckoning and full Retribution [rotations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1STpACyoKe-ka3_9WTmmIcwab-e8yKbLoyt2zGouy9-o/edit#slide=id.g4475b969c5_9_147) and [builds](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1STpACyoKe-ka3_9WTmmIcwab-e8yKbLoyt2zGouy9-o/edit#slide=id.g4469d02944_0_154). 
---
Also keep in mind that these guides were mostly made before these things were confirmed not to work in Classic.
---
Damn buddy, if I knew it'd hit you so deep I wouldn't have posted it :(
---
what a good set , but FOR THE HORDE !
---
Wow i didn't think of that, disregard my previous comment. I envy your intelligence
---
If you want LFG, go play retail. I can't believe anyone with a brain can even believe that LFG in any way would be good for classic. What a terrible and awful idea. Thank god the player base got what we wanted and saw this whole addon fiasco dissolve quickly.
---
Breakup letters are always tough.  Guess you're just gonna have to cruise highway reststops for you action now...  \*sighs in sympathy\*
---
indeed, move to a none full realm... erm okay, which?
---
The ones that drop 5 hours before launch...
---
I’ve dreamed of the perfect post in here. 
---
And you nailed it.
---
You did tldr on the short part wtf dawg
---
Yup. As of this morning all English EU realms *are* now fully 'Full', with the exception of the two RP servers.
---
Will there come more servers up at launch? I didn't wanna buy game time before the last day, but now I can see the only available realms are for RP in EU English servers, every other server is full before the game even launched? Dafuq.
---
Ayyy same. It was so hard to sleep. And now i'm at work...
---
Yeah I pretty much hate Org, so I'm going go spend all my time in UC. Probably the best looking city. I'll miss IF though :(
---
Let's pray that Blizzard adds more realms BEFORE launch, and not after. It is 100% certain that they will add more realms, there is no other way around this.
---
A bit too edgy maybe.
---
Layering will change nothing when it comes to queues. All layers will be hosted on the same server
---
Warriors are the absolute best single target dps class on almost every boss fight, and as the gear gets better the disparity grows larger. If your dps meters aren't run by warriors you need better warriors in your guild.
---
Druids seem so hard to maintain though. And I'm not really into healing which makes them a tough pick
---
They've been supporting it for 15 years, its not gonna change
---
Someone dosnt understand hype .
---
... it's literally on their website. Are you incapable of finding information on your own or just unwilling?
---
Pretty much the same, actually. The first guy's logic was terrible, and he followed with a similarly stupid (but deliberately) statement
---
Jeez, you're awake at 3:40AM? Nice.
---
That's really all life's about friend. Find what makes you happy, poop in them socks!
---
This is sooo cool! They need this!
---
Guys: don’t we have to suffer through a server maintenance as well tomorrow?
---
Ah I’m a tbc child, so missed the memo haha
---
That's actually good advice
---
This legit happened to me before. Guy loots the powder then had to leave. Stranding us at the door.
---
I'm going horde this time. I am so gonna miss the epic questlines of duskwood - never been above 10 as horde - does it have similar?
---
I guess you just weren't around during it's heyday. Those weren't the selling points back then.
---
Watch out for Defias Pillagers in Westfall lol, and make sure to quest in Duskwood, it was always my favorite zone.

Kanye is a critically acclaimed artist so he’s definitely a talented person. If you don’t like his music or him as a person that’s fine, but calling people delusional for not sharing the same opinion as you is pretty retarded. Also Lmfuckingao not “Lfuckingmao”.
---
I dont think it's a mistake just needs a revamp maybe limit the fly time due to exhaustion of the mount and give mobs nets to try and get you if you aggro them.
---
Not sure what you mean. Should the tl;dr: have been at the bottom?

i prefer tbc and lich king over classic sorry

did it back in vanilla. not going to make this mistake again.

World of Warcraft is a feeeeeeling, who needs a social life?

---
Why is this a post?
---
This is not really true. You can easily tank as Arms even at 60. Thunderclap is very risky to use and often not worth it because it costs a lot of rage and deals very little threat because you can't use it in defensive stance.
---
Wtf is this shit? If you can really hit 60 in under 60 hours and beat all of MC within a week then this isn't actually classic.  If this all really happens then I definitely am passing on all this.  How the fuck is it different than retail now then?
---
Ive always been that guy. Never really sat in a guild very long but always got invited to groups by people I met in dungeons and lvling.
---
[And in the official video it's all focused on front-stabbing and at no point does he mention that this is a private-server only bug.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkawrueQYXU)

---
Zug zug!
---
You can open menu and system in game. There you have the graphics slider, with 1-10.
---
Setting Nr. 3 is listed as classic graphics.
---
People said they would never release Vanilla again, but it launches tomorrow.
---
I'm not expecting to get far necessarily, just observing the chaos
---
Well, the dropchance is always the same BUT in classic you don't share the drop (besides one drop quests).
---
That means, if you have to collect 5 boar ribs and it has a 50% chance to drop, you have to kill 10 of them. If you are in a group of 2, you need to kill 20 boars. If you in a group of 3, you need to kill 30 boars and so on.
---
In general, do the drop quests allone, but you can group up if:
---
- too many players around and you can't tag a mob (no kill = no loot)
---
- you kill the mobs 2x as fast in a duo
---
btw if your teammate kills something 20yards away fand the drop is for you, well then you have to walk all the way up to the corb to get the loot.
---
Look at crul’shurokh in the DB it’s equivalent to a level 66 blue Amani venom-axe.  A level 66 blue is a far cry from level 61 greens and crul’shurokh is a BWL weapon.

Tell me... tell me everything!
---
I don't think it is, I mean it's the same thing with say playing with family... You're both there and theoretically you could get on someone else's account like your brothers or your wife's. I think more than anything else people just don't like it because typically if you're a multiboxer you have spent a lot of time figuring out exactly what to do in different situations. And because all of your clients are being run by you you have instant reaction time and perfect communication with well... Yourself
---
It won't be enough
---
Is it only pve? Ore is it pvp to? Cuz you can't compare these 2.
---
A warrior is a damage meter god later, and the only true tank All the way.
---
While a shaman have so much more to offer as support, like windfury totem og spring totem, if you wanner be a shaman there is a hybrid build there let you heal in raid and dps in pvp Ore the dungeon if you want to, but just remember if you play shaman you don't have to top the meters but you just gonna lay All totem so the other is much stronger.

because those other mmos sucked
---
Well, my point was more of a rush ahead to stop those bored 40's from slapping gray colored people.
---
Worse, much worse!
---
&gt; The retail is actually a better game from a game design perspective. There are many things to be done, many ways to have fun, and the endgame is reachable to people who can't spend half the day playing, while still being challenging to more hardcore players.
---
Classic is one of the most approachable games out there. Nothing forces you to play daily, and the more casual players got rewarded with a lot of Rested XP.
---
The endgame being exclusive to the more hardcore players is something that gave players something to look up to, and gave you a lot of social status within the game. 
---
Just like being a child to very rich parents that can't raise the child properly, and try to fill the gaps with nearly limitless amounts of money, life just becomes boring on ez-mode when there's literally no extrinsic motivation for you to become good at anything (and 0 intrinsic motivation as well due to not being raised well).
---
Working hard towards amazing goals is deeply ingrained in our society. And Classic hit the nail right on the head with the way progression was laid out.
---
Does it support classic? I didn't see an option for it.
---
Hahah believe me I considered it, thanks man, no queue, but plenty of ganking and catching up to do!
---
Yes You will. in STV.... I'll be on whitemane and I figured your going horde. ALLY FTW
---
Blizzard
---
open the blizzard launcher like you're gonna open WoW and before you click DOWNLOAD or PLAY under "version" select World of Warcraft and change it to World of Warcraft Classic. Then Download classic. Then if you got gametime added to your retail account you'll be able to log in
---
Yea, those.
---
What?
---
Laundry for tomorrow done, really gotta go. Leaving with this genuine question: while adjustable dungeon/raid difficulty is a non-vanilla addition to WoW, has there ever been a time when grinding was not an expectation of the progression raider?
---
:D Enjoy classic however you can. 
---
/get better soon
---
Yep woke up at 1:30am have to work at 8am. I’m hoping to get a couple more hours before work!
---
What’s with you guys and screenshots?
---
Get over it. The meme is dead.
---
I wonder how many of those people have not had a SERIOUS 24 hour + Game Session in 15 years and are going to crash fucking HARD when they realize their 30+ bodies cannot cope like they could when they were teenagers and need actual food to function now.
---
Yeah I’m not going to comment on modern WoW as people generally don’t like what I have to say, but the whole “TBC resets my gear” thing is just silly to me.
---
Your right, its impossible to keep old gear relevant while making new content. Its why power creep exists in every game.
---
Look at Hearthstone - what is the incentive to buy new cards when the old ones are statistically the same? there isn’t so over the expansions the power difference between Base cards and expac cards has ramped up a lot.
---
I’d love to see an example of an MMO without power creep - but at least when its done per expansion it means a total reset for all the players in game.. your right about Modern WoW, IIRC my Mythic+ gear was obselete not a month into the game by Warfronts.
---
I just want to level up and do dungeons together.
---
It's pretty easy to tell after reading your comments... I love butthurts. Makes me want to pvp even more. Bet you have second account just to login to the opposite faction to complain. 
---
See you soon.
---
I agree and I would be for bringing tbc balancing. I just don’t have the love for Outlands, Shattrath and flying mounts as some others apparently do.
---
Am I reading this right? Are we on pst getting to play TOMMOROW!?! (technically today since it's 1 am)
---
I was getting all prepared and hyped for Tuesday.
---
You're gonna get pwned. Repeatedly.
---
My dad, worried about how much I played WoW, showed me this video and plainly said "please never end up like this".

i dropped Questie yesterday and switched to Classic Codex. It has pretty much same features as Questie, but it shows exact spawn locations for mobs/npcs/objects. It also shows quest item drop chances on specific mobs.
---
Right there with you man....rough...

Y'all sure care a lot about your LFG addon for something that's "already done by meeting stones and isn't powerful at all"

It’s my wife and I’s anniversary! But seriously she is letting me play after we go out to eat. I may be sacrificing anniversary sex for WoW.

What I would do as a new player who hasn't played wow is to buy the base game (retail wow) if it is cheaper than a one month sub as it will include a months sub in it. I managed to get the battle chest for £5 (UK pounds) where as one months sub is £9.99.

Come Zandalar Tribe (RP PVP), split is nearly 52/48 for the Alliance
---
Classic+ would be fun but the gear by naxx tier is already breaking the balance of the game, so I'm not sure how they would solve that with future upgrades.
---
I would also be down with TBC with no flying (the zones would have to be somewhat redesigned to facilitate this)
---
Yeah it sucks. But at the Same time I am kinda looking forward to seeing the whole thing from a new perspective and I'm hoping itll be similar to the feeling I got back then when everything was new. I played human paladin back in the day so my first idea was to go UD priest and just imagine  that I had been turned into an UD lol That way I'd kinda be playing the same character at least.

---
Reading old comments i see that gnomes can pick up the quest in stormwind. So i assume that any race can in any location as long ad they are the correct level and class
---
Leveling isn't even really the problem. Once you're 60 you then need to collect several sets of gear - for tanking, DPS, and PvP. And if you're trying to become as well geared as possible, some of those BIS BoEs are really expensive, especially for prot.
---
If you're playing casually I guess it won't matter much but Warrior is probably the most time consuming class to play if you're properly taking advantage of their strengths.
---
The good news is, if you like tanking (and you should if you're playing Warrior), dungeon runs for exp are probably going to be really popular, which means you'll be in high demand.
---
This was the pretty standard thing to do back in the day when you were done playing. I have a friend who sold 2 accounts he'd level up with me and play for a while and get sick of it and was a college student who could get a bit of money for an account at the time. This was before "bnet" and so many other things that have made it difficult.
---
You perfectly fit my "awkward gamer dude bro" fetish
---
Things probably 20 years old and works like a charm
---
My very first character is going to be an alliance warrior, probably on Gehennes but we'll see.
---
My plan is, at the beginning of every dungeon, to ask if there's anyone new who has never played WoW or done the dungeon before. I will then invite them onto Discord if they want to talk as we do the dungeon, and if not then I'll let them know they're free to ask any questions in party chat and I'll answer.
---
Going to take my time getting to 60 and help anyone who hasn't played before.
---
What’s everyone’s Launch day looking like?  Any exciting plans? LAN parties?  Finger foods or takeout?  Beers or energy drinks? Hahah.
---
World of Clowncraft
---
Chef life.
---
Yes it is, you should have taken off a week after launch. Throwing all your time onto launch was just asking for it, no one else to blame for that
---
Just take a sleeping pill or someone to clobber you over the head with a club
---
It was a close race but in the end I think I prefer no 1
---
This so much. Some people actually *wants* to play, but for some reason they cant do that because they got kids and wifes, im just wondering.. do they have absolutely zero time for hobbies? Playing a video game can be a hobby, no one says you have to nolife 8+ hrs a day.
---
Yeahr the lesser magic wand for lvl 5 has the same DPS or higher then what you get 8 lvl later. I wouldn't do it eather if I would play alone but in a duo it's perfect! You don't have to farm that mutch.
---
And this was exactly what I was looking for. Much appreciated mate!
---
You didn’t watch the whole video.  Watch the whole thing because this comment is embarrassing
---
I counted and there are only 21637 you karma whore
---
Honestly I prefer to put my efforts into 1 character.  
---
Should I decide to level a second, I prefer another class.
---
Plus summoning DG in Org / IF and those sweet sweet Portals..
---
I’m doing both cause I am in-between jobs atm.
---
Unfortunately I’ll be on the road heading to a Buddies house for launch. Hope you get thatbrest in this evening though!
---
Those two 14 bag slot q's are fairly great.
---
You're half right. It works insofar s you *will* be crit, but that crit will **not** proc Enrage or Blood Craze.
---
This is the original (vanilla) behavior; only on private servers did it ever proc those effects.
---
Who decides what's a mistake though? Vocal minority on reddit? Sub counts?
---
I don't see them ever implementing something like that. If for nothing else, it would screw over casuals. Imagine you don't care about keeping up with news, you just want to play the game. Then login one day and see "hepp, all the stuff I worked for for X months is now gone. Guess I'll just go play something else then."
---

---
Thanks, was just curious if there was any raiding bonus to being an alchemist.  So the only dps increase comes from engineering?

Auctionator.. not super poweful but easy to use. My go to addon for posting items in the AH. Simply alt+click an item in your bag and it scans current prices and suggests a similar orice without doing a idioticly large undercut, which could ruin the economy
---
Hey man- I was also struggling between orc and undead. The thing that swayed me towards orc was the reminder that there are items that can give you the undead casting animations- (such as noggenfogger elixir), but there are no items that can give you a permanent 25% stun resist.

I learned something too. I knew exactly what you meant when I read the title of your post. I guess I'm "hardcore" too, even if I spend all my hours fishing or picking flowers. ;)

My wife and I became really good friends with a girl that joined our guild back in Wrath. She always kept her life private so we didn't pry. She did tell us her first name was in the name of her hunter. She was one of our most reliable guildies thru Cata and MoP and then maybe a couple of months into WoD, we all said goodnight one night and that was it. She never logged back on again. There has been others outside of the guild that will pst us and ask about her. They all say she was very quiet about her private life with them too. We like to think she kept her privacy so if she ever decided to bail from the game, no one could guilt her into coming back, but she loved the game, even WoD, so we're probably just kidding ourselves.
---
Then maybe it would interest you 🤷🏼‍♂️. The thing is it’s skill requirement is where it is not because of some enjoyable skill based thing requiring decision making ect. The ceiling is there because of poor class design, counter intuitive shitty mechanics such as dead zones and shared DR, and grindy crap like feeding your pet and needing ammo. 
---
If you where successful and enjoyed TBC 3v3 then you’d probably wreck as a mage and love it. 2700 in tbc was like top 10 in majority of battle groups wasn’t it?
---
So you are going to play as NE rogue. Ahh, i see a man of culture.
---
Its actually a mace.
---
A computer, a internet connection, an active sub and a helluva lot of time &amp; patience.
---
I actually have some of it that I’ll be drinking Pre launch today.  That and a mixture of sours and IPAs.
---
If you really want to enjoy classic the way it is, don‘t ask for tips or anything tbh, just go and play the game it suits you
---
Friend of mine bought gold in Classic. He used his moms credit card and just told gave her the cash in return from his allowance.

Mograine is the only server where Alliance are not out numbered in the poll. Not sure why people suggest Gehennas when it's apparently trending towards 60% horde dominated.
---
Is it just because APES are playing there?

[You'd be missing out on this item](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation) which is pretty much the pinnacle of 'vanilla/classic' alliance faction pride.

For anyone curious . Yes it was staged and the bro recording had a youtube channel that had many different vids of his brother freaking out about different things . At one point they told everyone they were all staged cause well people couldnt tell lol.
---
Yep, my bad.
---
it's 90%.
---
im loling

Because you can satisfy most of the "waaah I want TBC content" and "waaah I want classic" by simply doing Classic+ and taking the good content from TBC and every other good expansion.

Sorry, annoyed at how big of an opportunity that guy just blew. If you didn’t know, his guide is also no longer free. You have to pay a membership to view it. Even though he originally stated it would remain free.
---
Thanks Redditor,
---
now I can't forget to take a screenshot for sending my friend who can't play that much this week.
---
Depends on your class and how fast of a leveler you are. A Hunter who’s quested from 1 to 60 multiple times will be faster than a dungeon spam group. 
---
But for the average player, dungeon leveling is faster and the way to go.
---
Yeah. We have this notion that somehow if it's gray it cannot sell. Gray items are just as valuable and just as profitable as white items... green items, blue items.
---
Not to mention there are good stuff in 5mans aswell, even some BiS gear, so people will always have a reason to run these on either mains or alts
---
I’ll be right there with  you!!
---
With some pizza rolls as well! I’m going ALL the way back!  Except during vanilla it was Miller high life light. I am NOT going back to that.
---
Well said! Thank you. I’m surprised by how much hate this post got
---
Maybe I didn’t explain well, I’m 100% playing classic.
---
I levelled in bc on a laptop that i had to restart any time i went back to orgrimmar. It would drop to like 1 fps or lower, even if there wasn't anyone around.

There are PvP specs Human Rogues can use that would otherwise be suicide on a non-human Rogue, aside from that there's no real difference, just the various racial trade-offs.
---
that´s like 100% the same thing my friend told me... he had the retail version and when he downloaded classic (he has an active subscription) he only needed to select classic and make a small download, but I can´t even select to play classic, so I guess you only see classic once you have a subscription, anyway I get my sub today so I can test it :)
---
Psst! I know who you are, hail Sithis!
---
Hahaha. Living the high life lol.  I’m sure we will have some various snacks as well.  Good luck! Hope you have an awesome launch.
---
Yup, have a day with my family planned.  Always have fun with them so time will pass quickly then it's just a few short hours until launch!
---
Yes. You're correct, I keep in my head that "PvP isn't happened until phase 2".
---
This post is even more irrelevant.
---
Max players that you encounter in a continent* So low level zones will still be very crowded at the start.
---
Oh, you leave 'em out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs...
---
Oof, I feel you. Bought a magazine with a little WoW guide and a trial CD as extra because I watched my cousin play it and thought it was really cool. I wasn't old enough at the time, so my father never allowed me to use a credit card. Good thing they changed it down the line.
---
I consistently take care of myself so that I can go hard as fuck at times like this without worry. I'm hoping to play at least 30~ hours before I go to sleep the next day.
---
It doesnt bother me, and it will most likely never hinder your enjoyment of the game. I've always known dual boxing exists, but it's never stopped me from enjoying the game and reaching the goals i've set for myself. Maybe they get there first, maybe they do it easier. Maybe I die to them. But someone will always beat me, have an easier time, or be faster. It doesnt matter if they get there because they paid more or spent longer on the game or played more characters. the simple fact is dual boxing will only stop you if you let it.
---
hey in PvE i am totally fine but in PvP it can really be a pain
---
While it is cheating, and I don't condone it, i disagree with this sentence:
---
&gt; you are ruining the game and your own experience in it
---
If you are enjoying every aspect of the game. (PvP, Raiding, Dungeon Farming) but HAAAAAAAAAAATE Gold farming. Buying gold saves your experience and makes it actually fun for you.
---
You're still a cheating asshole who should be banned. But it didn't ruin your own experience.
---
Go the direction of OSRS and introduce new content that is still "classic". A new, completely different direction that is voted on by the community. But we can debate this for awhile.
---
I’d go with hunter. They’re very fast to level and don’t need much gear to shine in pvp.
---
World of Roguecraft (Just the first episode might be enough though), Maydie's Warrior PvP video and possibly one of the Hunter vs. The World videos, they were made by a hunter dedicated to showing other hunters how to solo a bunch of shit back then (even DM tribute)
---
You're not alone with your dilemma my friend.. I'm starting to panic. My first char was Tauren Shaman, I love Mulgore (even tho it's big as f..) their stomp comes in handy PvP-wise, but I'm really considering Orc, racials are just as good and the gear looks better (I'm not a fan of boots on hoofs), but I'm not a big of a fan of Durotar.
---
&gt; slaughtering the alliance
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
And I feel you 100%. The thing that sucked me in when WoW first game out was just the wonder of it all. A huge that I got to explore over a long period of time. I was totally in it for the adventure, getting to see all these cool places and slowly build myself up in a world I really felt like I was a part of.
---
There's little things about how the skills were meted out, too. I leveled a mage as my first character, and it was always super exciting to get new tiers of food and drink, but they'd cost _so much mana_ to use that I'd keep the old version on my bars for a few levels, and decide whether to spend a ton of time conjuring stuff, or less time conjuring and more time sitting and eating/drinking.
---
And I've missed being the person who runs by a random player and tosses your buff to them! Then you get a little /wave back, or they toss a buff over to you. Built such a sense of community. I remember I came back during Legion after having not played for years, and I was bummed that there was basically no buffs I could just toss to people.
---
There are a ton of little things like that that really added to the adventuring feel of vanilla. I'm am very excited to jump back in and feel like I can take my time and experience the world again.
---
What ever will I do about this? My internet life is over!
---
Just honest, as usual.
---
Yes you can level slightly quicker and yes you can farm more gold.
---
But you have to put in more effort to do so and you're playing multiple characters less efficiently than you would be just playing one.
---
It's no way Pay 2 Win.
---
The only issue is those one guys controling 5 Shamans spamming chain lightning in BGs and WPvP, which can easily be defeated by two actual players on two toons.
---
Multiboxers are free kills in PvP. Multiboxers don't raid efficiently. These players are paying extra money to meme basically. Theyre not actually doing anything competitive.
---
Proof being that no high level PvP or PvE happens with multiboxing.
---
You too! Enjoy the greatest beer season to ever have seasoned!!
---
Very wrong. Dungeons dont give good xp in classic. And it's a pain to get all the quests for the dungeon. They are often spread out across multiple zones. Or require you to do other quests to open them up.
---
Just play the game man, to truly have an authentic experience is to discover stuff as you play. You'll install addons as you play, there are a few that people see as the best ones, a simple google search would yield tonnes of results. As to what to look out for, enemy players in Stranglethorn Vale (where men become menlier). And the only thing I recommend avoiding is buying gold from anyone, this is not only against TOS, but just a shitty thing to do

---
I didn't even think about it until recently, but yeah this has got me excited. Seeing an entire community level up alongside each other is going to be really special, it's something you can't get from the launch of new WoW expansions because someone who got beta access optimized their route and is able to cap in a few hours, and is swiftly followed by everyone else in a few days.
---
Truth full answer is: we don't know. We have continent layering which manages with some of it, but starting areas will likely be very very busy and getting out of level 5 or 10 in the first few days might be a bit of a battle, I reckon.

Herb+Min is not worth it at the beginning, no one has moeny so you wont sell much and if you do not for a reasonable price. Its allways worth to get something out of your mats. So I would say skinning is fine as long as you char need leatherworking.
---
I returbed to WoD after leaving about midway through WotLK. The first thing I saw when creating a new character was some low level driving around on a motorbike. That return to wow was so fucking depressing.

Absolutely. Pumpkin beers, cask ales coming up.  My favorite time of the year for seasonals .  You enjoy as well!

Seriously comprehensive answer. Thank you. I’m used to the one-button-group solution from playing Elder Scrolls. It wasn’t always like that, though. To be honest, I really hate kicking people, unless they’re just unpleasant. I’ve had so many experiences where someone in a group hasn’t been pulling their weight, and it turns out that they’re not properly geared or clueless. Fortunately, crafting and explanation solve both those problems. If I have time, I’ll try to get through it with them. It’s great getting a completion for someone who would generally be booted and forgotten in minutes.

This comment right here!

I like that you go for healthy food like I have been going to do for. But you should try tuna down the monotony food a little bit.
---
OK for the bad pun joke.
---
Try checking out making onigiri food.

You eat cold and it's really easy to make alot of them and you can make many different tastes both with tune or some kind of seafood inside it
---
It’s honestly awesome that you never experienced vanilla. because now you will actually get to have an experience of vanilla wow as someone who never played it. And that’s a great thing
---
stay the course friend! I too will be on Herod
---
Yep. There are plenty of guides for tanking out there (look up Skarm on youtube), and learn the basics. After that, tank from time to time while leveling, get the feel for it and just have fun. It's not as stressful as it can seem.
---
My only Addison’s are going to be an auction addon and a tooltip one so I can see the vendor prices of quest rewards.

That keeps it pretty close to launch with some help on the gold making front.

Just take it easy. Read quest text to find out where to go.  There is no hand holding like now.

---
I'm glad you found it interesting! I will be writing another installation soon that deals with what we should be doing during launch week to earn gold.
---
I think the love for tbc actually comes from the rest. It pust everyone on the same level again. Most people did not play much of classic, so they were always behind. Tbc also did some innovative stuff that blew minds back then. I think the solution is to fork the server if they add on. Let people choose to move on or stay behind. Simple solution and makes everyone happy.
---
Question:
---
I have gone through and downloaded all the AddOns that I want for day 1 Classic, but when loading up the game client it says that my AddOns are out of date and may not work correctly, and it looks like a lot of them say they are out of date, even though I just downloaded the newest versions from CurseForge and GitHub. Is this a known bug? Just ignore? Or did I do something wrong? Also, how do I update AddOns in the future?
---
Another question:
---
Do I need to do anything with my client before tomorrow? Should I just load up WoW Classic about an hour before and click Enter World when it shows available?
---
I love statiatics
---

---
As someone that does multibox, the only thing it really gets you that kind of matters is some quicker ways to make gold if you put in a ton of work, especially outside of retail since you can't just boost a bunch of characters.
---
Outside of doing easy dungeons by yourself, it does not help you in higher end pve at all. 
---
And while you can one shot a random player, you aren't going to be successful in pvp, even if /follow did work in pvp on retail (not sure if it works in Classic), because 1 good player that knows how to CC will ruin your set up very quickly. From first hand experience, rogues are very good at it.
---
And even on the one thing it is good at, gold making, someone that is a master at playing the AH will make tons more gold than you ever will by the time you get your multiboxing operation going. 
---
Beyond that, the only other thing it is useful for is collecting stuff, like pets, transmog, and mounts, which isn't even an issue in Classic, and in retail it doesn't effect anyone else.
---
So overall, no, you really aren't winning all that much by doing it, especially when you consider how much it costs to do so. In the end, most people that multibox are really just doing it because they can and they find it fun.
---
What are the Oceanic servers looking like population wise?
---
If the outpouring of amazing advice here is a taste of what’s to come, I look forward to joining the community. I expect some jankiness (the game is 15 years old, after all) but I prefer that to a beautiful but soulless alternative.
---
That’s genius. So you don’t have to fly back to main capital each time you need to see the ah. In retail there’s just portals everywhere so it hasn’t been a problem.
---
Well, to be fair, basically all of the addons make the game easier in some way :p 
---
Except this one funnily enough, it just removes being social :p
---
That's not *a feeling*.

And you're wrong.

---
NoOnE wAnTs ToC
---
*) Save your gold, don't buy anything you don't strictly need. You'll need 100g at level 40 for a mount.
---
*) No guides needed, just remember to read quest texts and especially tooltips for your abilities. You get new spells and abilities sufficiently slowly that you can easily find time to learn them inside out as you level.
---
*) Your class trainer will have new spells and bilities for you to learn every 2 levels, the even ones. Consider whether you need all of them while levelling, as training can cost significant amounts of gold.
---
*) Respeccing will get *really* expensive, really quickly, so knowing how to sensible spend your talent points ahead of time may be one of the few things I'd look into before starting.

I understand, but I hope you understand that buying Gold online is destroying the in-game economy? That gold is valuable is one of the very true vanilla things. If you buy gold online it partially is pay-to-win.
---
If you hate grinding mobs for gold, you can play the auction house, offer tanking services (if you play warrior), offer enchanting, create a sustainable income source through materials which are on a timer: Tailoring (Mooncloth), Alchemy (arcanite transmog), Leatherworking (forgot what it was) or well just run lots of Dungeons and take it slow, eventually the income would come.
---
Bring some value the your faction and in return you will get gold. The goal is the journey.
---
No. It’s also usually always skewed to alliance on pve realms.

Yes classic + is better idea because mt hyjal, karazhan, emerald dream,  and more was planned before exapansions.

I cannot fucking wait to spend an hour in the Barrens cobbling a group together for Wailing Caverns. I cannot fucking wait to hit 40 and waste a ton of time with my friends wandering STV hunting Alliance, only to eventually get killed when they call in a 60 friend of theirs. I cannot fucking wait to actually talk to people again, to go through dungeons and wipe and have that be okay because a 5 minute time loss isn't that big of a deal. I cannot fucking wait to party up with someone who's doing the same quest as me and shoot the shit for half an hour until we part ways again.

Im not but my duo leveling partner wont be around. It is a great dilemma but atleast I can make an alt.

Orc is objectively the better race for warrior but undead is a great choice too. Either or will be perfectly fine

Nope, had dreams of being late to launch or being stuck in que.  Exactly the same feeling i get in the first day of a new job.  I am awake 4 hours earlier that i need to be, which is earliee than usual because i got lucky enough to work an early shift today.

Not even in a dream would I think about hiding a god damn launcher or game on my pc and not a single one of my friends even plays alot of videogames like I do.
---
I'm not playing.
---
I had my first GPU while playing vanilla, it was a Readon 7000 with an astounding 64mb of onboard ram! In Tanaris I had to look at the ground to move cause I guess ATI didn't like the sand :D
---
You'll have a ton of issues. Running into SW every 2-4 levels for new skills will suck bigtime.
---
Correct
---
Fantastic, I just work 40 hours a week and have gym and hobbies, Not 13 anymore so don't really have the time to invest in "decking" out a character to be successful in pvp, I'd rather play something that actually wrecks everyone at most points in the game, and scales with minimal gear
---
Horde version?
---
That's pretty cool
---
Chicken is super easy and healthy. Preheat oven to 400, tenderize, season with salt and pepper I like lemon juice too. Cook until 165 internal

I will invite you into my party and give you Battle Shout

---
Its basically coffee. Chill.
---
On the top right corner is a dropdown menu that should show your classic folder. If it doesn't search for installed games.
---
Blizzard disagrees, they've stated on several occasions that they regret ever putting it in.
---
I essentially just re-rolled the same toon after 13 years. I plan on playing some other classes, but my druid is probably the only one that will get to 60
---
Thx)))
---
Holy fuckballs! I guess I shouldn't have clicked sites that end with .uk 😂😂
---
It's 2 different downloads. Classic is standalone, it's only like 4GB though. However it seems to be kinda random whether you are able to select the wow classic client for download took me several days for it to show up. After that I was able to start the classic client though
---
Before I go...
---
Am I the only one thinking he was pretty daft for writing in an in-game communication that he's about to sell his account?
---
Things I don't like = gay
---
Looks like the CSS didn't load up.
---
you think the classic community is going to die off if people are given options? keep in mind the server cap way back when was miniscule compared to what it is today, and the servers are bursting at the seams
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Lentilsoup. Chickpea salads. Can of Lentils with grilled bell peper and goat cheese, throw it in the over for a bit to heat the cheese and lentils. Rice and veggies is easy enough too. Have fun!
---
Fair enough, you want to talk about being poorly trained though; Human Males... What the fuck is that sword and shield stance? lol
---
Yup, that's me. I am not even decided on the faction. Played horde for like 13 years, but my first year was as alliance and i surely would love to relive parts of that. Choices choices
---
Don't be scared about playing a class dude, it's just a game at the end of the day have some fun
---
&gt; I would note, I think it's worth mentioning that you should not use 100% "at creature health" as rend is a significant portion of your dps up to level 30. You can easily check this using a dps meter as you play, I suspect you will be putting in a number of 85-90%ish, leveling as arms. and probably do a similar thing for deep wounds when you get it, but I don't know what that will be. 
---
This analysis supports this. Rend has insane eDPR values. We also checked how much delaying rend by one gcd sacrifices as opposed to delaying sunder by one gcd and rend is ahead.
---
That is why our best estimate is that leading with rend is almost always optimal in a solo situation.
---
&gt; I also noted that you don't seem to think that thunder clap can proc deep wounds.
---
I really don't know. We are assuming that TC is a spell that cannot be dodged but resisted. The thing about it is that the question is not *that* interesting. It should be negligible because TC is already very good vs. 3-4 targets and not quite as good vs. 2 targets.
---
We were mostly concerned to figure out the very deep topic of rend vs. sunder vs. whirlwind vs. mortal strike.
---
I will keep things edited long-term and transition this into some sort of level 60 tool, probably as a web app once I am bored enough. But I don't need that sort of assistance until a month or two in.
---
&gt; Anyway, I am yet again surprised how sunder armor consistently fails to be as terrible as I had assumed a couple months ago.
---
Yeah, it's funny that even after 15 years an entire community can wrap their head around new beliefs.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Mostly though, thanks for apparently reviewing a lot of detailed parts! We already found a few bugs in the past like me using a wrong armor formula from memory instead of looking it up!
---
Instead, he just specced.... Arm.
---
Probably because your browser cache still has the CSS file. Try emptying the cache and it won't work anymore.

Or when you buff someone and they dont even acknowledge or thank you.

You poop on flight paths or you don’t poop at all.

If your computer came out after wow did, it can probably run it. That was the beauty of it back in the day, pretty much anything could play it.
---
i have work.... I wont be going tho!
---
I'm gonna steal 10 weapons for every post like this I see on this sub.
---
WoW's been good for me meeting IRL friends for like a decade tbf. In vanilla it was premade BGs / dungeons / raids, TBC added arenas and HCs to the mix, Cata added RBGs, MoP added challenge modes, legion added mythic+.
---
All content that you don't queue for interestingly, and mostly content that encourages use of voice comms so you wind up getting to know people a lot more personally IMO.
---
Haha, I did, too. But I fell asleep listening to leveling guides on YouTube, so that's my own fault.
---
Nah. This sub getting triggered so hard and issuing death threats against an addon maker was crazy enough.
---
I joined a guild when I started playing (1 month before WOTLK) and they took people on training runs through dungeons. 
---
Sometimes silly things like "Can you find your own way into Deadmines in less than 5 minutes" or "Hit that mob in Gnomer then jump down to the cog and wait for the instance to come to us" and sometimes serious things with LOS pulls and what happens if you fear humans in a crowded room (fuck the Cathedral muppets)
---
I was a rogue and on our SM run I was told to go stealth sap a mob in the courtyard
---
Crept over to him then stood up and stabbed him in the face.
---
I was a bad rogue
---
Yeah I remember when I get cooking bath meals  I get annoyed by how long the recipe says to sit on the couch...
---
Not a pedo. At 15 you probably hit puberty, pedos are attracted to pre-puberty.
---
It's difficult to do anything irreversibly wrong. At worst you'll have to respec. Aim to hit 60 within 2-3 months and go from there. Short term goals are the 100g for a mount and making friends. 
---
Seriously, make friends with a tank and you will have no problems for the rest of your days.
---
Am I the only person who's going to be ignoring this for at least two months? The starter zones are going so busy it they could be confused for a protest gathering.
---
Why that's only part of the authetic experience isn't it?
---
lol i played a warrior on a pserver a while back (emerald dream I think?) and kept getting called a noob by dps for not holding aggro on the 5+ mobs they pulled with AOE taunt. Like bud I dont know what expansion youre used to but, thats not how that skill works in vanilla. I bet there will be a ton of that
---
I'm saving a card if TBC ever gets created.
---
Take as long as you'd like ;) no need to rush eating
---
This is such outdated information. We found out on classic beta that elite mobs in dungeons give higher XP gains and are easier to kill than what private servers have shown us all these years. It's now become viable to run through dungeons with a committed group. Just do a quick google search you'll find full spell cleave or melee cleave groups leveling through dungeons on classic beta (for example venruki's group)
---
haha yeah I agree. "Ah shit, here we go again".
---
Warlocks can also survive any fall by using their voidwalker sacrifice. The fall could only do your max HP in damage in vanilla so you survived with the difference between the shield and your HP.
---
Oh yeah that is a good tio with amp magic mind control didnt even think of that ty
---
Wow that’s ridiculously stupid. Thanks for the info.
---
Some of us like to build themselves into games
---
Dude, all the links are there. What are you smoking? lol
---
I used to play a Human, now I’ll play undead
---
So yeah, kinda
---
How are they at 60 when nobody has gear? That's all I'm worried about, I don't want to be "good with gear" when gear is 6 months down the line, I want to enjoy myself and be effective at every point in the game
---
^ this guy knows
---
any of those is fine at 60. if you're going casual, the biggest hurdle will be finishing the grind to top level. we're talking about 3-4 months of leveling and no bg's whatsoever. if you pick something you don't enjoy much, you won't make it.
---
are there other types of servers?
---
Isn't server population counted in Individual active accounts who have characters on the server? 
---
So one player making characters on every server counts as 1 player on each server in terms of determining "Low, medium, High, full" ? Since Player Pop in realm list is a matter of Potential players and a tool for new players to get an idea of how many can potentially play
---
&gt;  It's meant to be played how it was originally played.   
---
1. There were addons that automated and made easier find groups
---
2. Anyone can play the game they way he wants. You can't say how other people should play the game. There were no speedrun community during 2004/2005, and still we have people theorycrafting ways to get to 60 as fast as possible, and how to clear raids on fastest time possible.
---
3. it is 1.13
---
4. Most of the game is from 1.12, this patch (including the minor patches) was available  for only 3 months, this is only a snap from more than 2 years of Vanilla WoW. 
---
5. Nobody is playing like it was. 
---
&gt; If you like lfg so much just play retail fuck sake. 
---
I don't "like" LFG. It is irrelevant for me, because I will powerlevel alone to 60 on the next 72 hours, and I already have plans with my guild to run end game dungeons for pre raid BiS. But even if I wanted to play lfg, your argument makes non-sense, because as I said in the post: **LFG isn't what differentiates retail from Classic**
---
Problem is its a re-release of game content that has been completed thousands of times. It can be planned for.
---
of course the horde player fails to understand humor
---
I can still see my last message to my gm when we broke up and went our separate ways guild wise.  I actually saw him online when I checked out retail after 7 years and a lot of them were back together but I won’t go back to retail seriously.
---
I would play horde with friends, and make an ally alt, strong solo class, to go explore and reminis.
---
A thread from a year ago, before the beta showed how dungeon mobs gave more xp than expected....
---
2.5k

Now that's a product name. They weren't far away with "Devil's Canyon" a few years back, though.

Looks great dude 👍🏻

There is no way guilds are going to hit 60 without sleeping. The world record 1-60 is 4 days 20 hours.
---
That's a sort of fair way to handle that kind of luck though, especially when you have such large groups of people and such a small number of drops.
---
Rice, chicken and some sauce. Buy frozen veggies then heat up. Also nuts and fruits.
---
6pm they are launching new servers.
---
Are you sure? I tried in the beta and they were super buggy.
---
Thanks, dude. Mind upvoting the post? some people just see the youtube link and clutch downvoted it...
---
Thanks! Never did anything like this before.
---
Guarantee people will start logging on now.
---
You could look for Kargoz on youtube. He has classguides for all classes and a google presentation to go with it that has slides with stuff like that. Hope that helps.
---
Woke up at 1 AM, it’s 4 now. Though I can blame the last hour on a hungry infant.
---
Not really though. If you don’t have at least a FAP for Gehenas for example, as a melee, you’re gonna seriously underperform. Same for razorgore. If you don’t have GFPPs for tough situations, you’re prob gonna die at least a couple times, unless you have a bunch of pvp gear and a lot of health (which isn’t gonna happen before at least 6months in). I mean, point is, you’re never gonna be close to the top without consumables.
---
6.66gb
---
Just go horde and either way you choose you'll be good
---
I did this on my laptop the other day, I have retail on the desktop but will just use laptop for Classic. Total size on my drive is 4.06Gb
---
*uses 16:30* fake American detected!
---
*misspells you’re* on second thought :p
---
Me neither man. I've been thinking about this but the last three months. I know I want to play shaman but I've always been horde and would like to play alliance side this time.
---
I guess I'll just let my heart decide once I'm in the character creation screen.
---
I can believe this, I know first hand that RNGesus has a sick sense of humour.
---
When I was raiding MC we once got the same shit gear we didn't need, Druid and Paladin I think, two weeks in a row. This was at a time where the playerbase was adamant there was an RNG seed tied to the raid leader (which Blizzard denied), so we pleaded for the GM to let someone else form the raid next time. It didn't happen, and we got the same shit loot for a 3rd week in a row. The following week someone else formed the raid, loot was completely different.
---
That many guilds had similar issues that I'm not quite ready to take off my tin foil hat just yet.
---
Probably a lot of people resubbing at once so it's just taking a while to kick in.
---
I will be going to whatever normal server I can get in to be honest.  I have a name saved on three but I will do what I have to
---
Nah I made a rape face dwarf.
---
&gt;I don't like the feeling of having to do my "WoW chores" everyday
---
I cannot agree more. That's why I stopped playing WoW when they introduced the Garrison.
---
I might be considered semi-hardcore as I'll aim to clear every raid and pretty much max out my gear.
---
However, for my more casual endgame, I like to set up gold goals. Ever had start of easy, get 10k gold, what worked, what didn't? Iterate and find methods you find enjoyment in until you reached your ultimate goal. Then you have the money needed to get twinks etc if you enjoy that. Also, one of my favorite things about being "rich" is just giving away stuff, the happiness someone can get from you randomly giving them a great BoE from the AH is enjoyment that is hard to beat IMO. Never tried to get rich in vanilla though so might be in for a rough ride in classic now.
---
I meal prepped a few things easy to heat up. Half cup rice + a pork chop or some chicken breast. Took me about an hour to prep 6 meals
---
/who levelrange, and whisper people.
---
Dude do you know how many veterans would give anything to experience wow for the very first time again? It’s the most fun you’ll ever have in the game. Enjoy! And don’t worry if not on reddit you will meet people to play with in game
---
No we didn't because those are from TBC
---
Do like me, exhaust yourself in terms of not sleeping enough - then when you go to bed early today, you'll sleep like a rock
---
My guy, my meal prep is so boring. Jasmine rice, baked chicken, and assorted veggies. Steak and those sides and then pasta with ground beef. Those of yours look like heaven.
---
I Love redbull and other energy drinks, Cola etc.
---
But for long sessions, I never drink more than like 1-2 cans (0,33 each). I really feel terrible if I eat too much shit like chips, only sugar drinks, chocolate, Pizza etc the whole day. I get tired early and just don’t feel good overall.
---
u/lane_cruiser thanks for the idea mate
---
You pick name when you make the charter.
---
\*Charge--enemy turns around\*  
---
It was at this moment Xninjafortnitex knew...he fucked up.
---
If theyre the best memories
---
Then rejoice and celebrate that you have them, 
---
because they are truly yours and no one else's except for those that shared the moments with you.
---
And with that you honor their life and memory.
---
Do you have multiple accounts? I had to switch from wow 1 to wow 2 because I hadn't played in 10 years
---
But is it Classic compatable?
---
More like basically impossible from what i remember.
---
You need reagents from 36 mobs in Arathi, low 30s in STV  
---
And the elite basically kills you in 4-5 hits even with nature resistance potions
---
Spirits be wit’chu mon!
---
I always thought the fastest levelling generally avoided dungeons
---
Is this really the fastest way?
---
Wow great work!!
---
maraudon is available at launch along with mc and onyxia
---
Exactly 1000 kills between 1st and 4th. And only 17 kills between 3rd and 4th. Crazy.
---
When will BG's be added?
---
When I first played WoW in 2005 or whatever I hated the idea of ganking and world PvP but it's actually not really a big deal. It can provide a lot of fun.
---
&gt; its cheating
---
It's cheating because ToU does not allow it - only because of that.
---
define "hard", is it hard to autoattack mobs for 1 month of avg leveling time ?
---
Everything will be full tomorrow. Especially the queue.
---
I find that to be part of the charm on expansions/"new" releases like this
---
For leveling Bear is BIS tanks since they can cast HOTs on them selves for better AoE threat openers than Warriors and avoid the healer taking healing aggro by having to heal.
---
❤️❤️❤️ all the best for tomorrow
---
For some fucked up reason I woke up early today so I'll be exhausted at launch 00:00. I need to find a way to sleep before release.
---
Looks like a good list!
---
my plan is to give out a bunch of little 6 slot bags to new players in Mulgore. Little things like that really help people along the way
---
Look he has a very small totem and only horde can be shaman.
---
Also NSFW tag OP ffs
---
Very cool Classic WoW content.
---
You could got some fat fucking cash back in the day. My friend sold his tier 2 geared mage with epic mount zhc, talisman of empheral power, max enchanting / herbalism and 800g on the account for 1000$ usd.
---
im almost sure you dont, but i havnt played since tbc and its not something i tested during the stresstest. I did play a rogue in vanilla though, and I feel like stalking people while emoting at them would be something I remember. It makes sense from an rp factor for it not to work, after all, speaking is visible to all when stealthed.
---
I actually created that statistic as OBS-Screen Overlay :) (hope it works, we'll se tonight...)
---
Guild I raided with in WOTLK had an old paladin man who raided with us and his daughter was an officer in the guild, think he died before the ICC raid patch and I always remember him talking about killing LK and saving azeroth. We never downed him before the end of wotlk, feelsbadman.
---
RP server players do. Because we don't want to get forced to change it.
---
yea right group up .... gonna be easier to kill you all at once.
---
Phase 3.
---
Concerning the date, we don't know the lenght of each phase
---
Lapdogs, all of you!
---
I work nights so launch is perfect. Gonna sleep until 5 then start trying to log on. Then I can stay up ALLLLLLLLL NIGHT AND MORNING.

---
im going to bed but ill say one last thing. The classic community will survive. Classic exists for one reason, and one reason only: There were a very loud, passionate, and dedicated group of advocates for classic, who would not take no for an answer. it was vanilla they were championing. not tbc, not wotlk. vanilla. There will always be a community for that, even if others move on.
---
Yep, thanks for the figures. That's why I said retaining even 50% would be a big win.
---
It is very common to get 60 pills of 30mg adderall for a month. The prescription is twice a day...
---
Cant believe youre destroying your brain with consistent megadoses of adderall for a fucking video game. 
---
1 or 2 days initially to level hard, fine, I guess I understand that... But this!? My God. Youre ruining your life and you dont even know it yet.
---
When I got into the game back in 2004, it took me 3 months to hit 60 and I enjoyed every millisecond of it. One of the best things you can do if you're completely new is avoid any of the addons that trivialize certain aspects of the game like Questie and Leatrix. Trust me.
---
u/saveboykings this sums it up if you're wondering. Also, I can't believe you haven't seen Forrest gump 2.
---
I’m 24 and I already have those thoughts the past few years. It’s awful, I hate panic attacks.
---
Nobody's going to jail to ruin the school reputation of a 15 year old
---
Hey, thats me too. Every time I think ive decided I get unsure about my decision
---
It skews towards heavy role playing, progression isn’t pushed nearly as hard on those servers
---
I’m gay ok! There I said it
---
What is it?
---
It could be true for the absolute min/maxed tryhard method, but if you want to actually experience the game, finish the quest and storylines, you need to do the dungeons at least once as most of them are he conclusion of their respective plot lines.
---
Yo we're not Shakespeares bro
---
Watch your back *stealth sound*
---
Hahaha what?
---
All servers are English speaking 😂
---
I did some quick quests along the way so not the fastest. Skip the quests you might be able to shave off 5mins.
---
But I don't know a faster way besides getting summoned.
---
4 chan weeb's and fury's are not my thing
---
This is the best
---
It's a shame it's patch 1.12 because walrocks were a lot of fun in PvE early vanilla too. 
---
Summoning players over the edge of cliffs. 
---
Putting Curse of doom on undergeared players while they were posessed by the baroness. 
---
At least it's a little fun to join groups and fly to instances, and if people are still sitting around in town expecting summons just drop group and find better people to spend time with.
---
I have to go to work 12 hours after the midnight launch, what do, what do
---
The kill was an Ornery Plainstrider. Chuck Norris was level 11.
---
what’re you gonna do? chain lightning us?
---
It's in there for leveling, haven't checked raiding yet if that's what you mean
---
Did you test this on beta or stresstest? I'm pretty sure, nobody ever picked short auctions in vanilla, because they lasted 2 hours. Also makes little sense to me to pay 12 times the deposit for only triple the duration.
---
Yeah it got really confusing because many sites were saying the 27th, but I was seeing people say less than 24 hours until launch.
---
&gt; Unless Blizzard has some crazy tech they have been hiding
---
They have, it's 10 or so more servers.
---
*perception sound*
---
&gt; Those games don't share the same player base as Classic.
---
What? I fully expect to play BL3 when it's out.
---
Where did you get that intel that those games don't share the same player base? Are our rigs only big enough to hold one game?
---
Stigma, I guess. I’m rolling on Hydraxian (and was on AD retail).  Can’t wait !
---
The stigma is unwarranted, but I can see the COD or PUBG crowd getting weirded out quickly.
---
I know this is unpopular but not everyone is the same.
---
Please don't buff me, don't heal me, don't give me stuff and don't help me kill mobs.
---
Everyone is talking about how meaningful leveling is in the game, that it's not a faceroll, etc. And I like it that way. I want to grow my character and progress by my own efforts. I want the challenge (it's not *that* big at all), I want to play the game. I'll ask for help when needed, thanks.
---
Obviously I won't /spit on you if you do those things. :D I don't mind it but I don't want it or need it. And I think there are others as well.
---
select your guild name and get the charter, then collect 10 sigs, then pay to register it
---
Oh, great! I was wavering between this and that one, so having both in one would be sweet.
---
Shadowpriests do melt faces
---
damn son perfect timing
---
I'm not going to eat anything at all while playing, having a break to eat something is better imo (plus I can't stand dust and crumbs in my keyboard). I have 2 cans of Monster energy in the fridge, and water. That's it.
---
I was looking up a couple ex guildies online and the first Google result for one of ours was an obituary stating he passed from cancer in 2014 shit sucks man :(
---
lol ok
---
\*laughs in blizzard \* /spit on you scumbags
---
You too! :)
---
Ah, the days when not everything Intel made had to be a lake for some reason.
---
Ye i was being sarcastic
---
I’m legally blind but love classic. I played a rogue up to AQ on a pserver— big mistake. With how bad my eyes are the most common message I received was “you must be behind your target” while I frantically circled my enemy waiting for backstab to trigger. I quit that rogue, and a year later rolled a hunter on a fresh server. I raided up to AQ on that character as well. I farmed DMN solo (if I can do it anyone can trust me). Unfortunately. even with min/max I was only able to achieve middle of the pack dps— oftentimes having much less prepared players outdpsing me (something you have to accept if you want to raid hunter). So the part of me who wants to be “the best” never really got to play the game.
---
Now I learned from the rogue that I don’t want to deal with staying in melee range, being blind and all— so I want to play a ranged dps. Between the 3, i am most knowledgeable of hunters, but I also don’t like how limited they are with their dps ceiling, but I also enjoy their solo farm content— I’ve never played a mage before, but considering they can top the meters, are also ranged and have viable dungeon solo farms... I feel like mage is the right pick here what do you all think?
---
Honestly down voting for edit lol, good lord. What a read.
---
you shouldn't let racial abilities dictate your choice of race. however, I will judge you for your lack of taste in aesthetics if you pick humans over gnomes. there's no excuse for this. you're a sick man.
---
This is my new desktop background :)
---
Ah, I see. Thanks!
---
Even when content comes out it doesnt invalidate the previous stuff but builds on it
---
is there a dwarf version?
---
Haha huge oof! Don't waste your study on wow! Classic will stick around :)
---
I feel you. Its def gonna hit my personal life hard the first couple of weeks,even months. I know this cause games just take over everything. But as stated, its capped and not getting an expansion, so ill try to tune it down this time!
---
As with any launch, queue times will be present. They've annonced adding more realms today to help with the queue times.
---
Retail babies crying about it a week later in completely unrelated threads is pretty sad too
---
Well, at least you've got nutella.
---
I'm playing at 3440x1440 and it works just fine. Worked as expected during open beta.
---
Just choose a faction already !! These god damn IRL Padaren...
---
They have the ability to fully remove queues with layering (except maybe launch day or two). They won't because queues have a second purpose of discouraging playing on certain overpopulated realms.

RP servers attract a specific type of player, whereas PvP and pve attract basically anyone...  If pve servers had no PvP at all, they would be much worsely populated than rp servers, but you can bet some people would play on them.
---
Generally speaking, rp servers attract a more mature crowd, and guilds are usually friendlier, since you're usually speaking in character.
---
Haters gonna hate.  Zandalar Tribe for life
---
I know many in the RP community aren't playing vanilla since they have more options/easier RP in retail.
---
God fuck no.
---
It’s even worse if your like me and you played since vanilla but you were a dumb kid who never raided, stopped playing right before hitting cap, just to rinse and repeat every expansion, skipping MOP then continuing only to finally start raiding at the end of legion just to quit two months into BFA.
---
Eat at your desk like everyone else friend
---
That's the spirit.
---
Gimme the source with the kick after 30 mins

I will be stuck at work for the first 12 hours of launch

I’m not crying... the addon still works. I’m just amazed you kids went full REEE over an addon.
---
It is called **Outfitter**. Don't know if it's updated.

You're making assumptions for one. Two many people are stocking on food like that as a celebration or event. Like watching the super bowl with beer and pizza and the like.

Oh, we humans will survive many 100s if not 1000s of years to come. Species as a whole wont die off quick. But your offspring? My offspring? They have increasingly larger chances to die by things we and our ancestors set in motion. And we will be one of the first generations future history books will point at as

2019 people on 1920s Germany:

"Why did the social democrats allow Hitler to rise to power and give him positions in the government? They are to blame!"
---
On 1930s Germany:
---
"Why didnt the non-nazi Germans (Hitler only got like 20% of Germans voting fof him) stop Hitler when he started assasinating rivals and attacking jews?"
---
People in 2019:
---
Willingly ignore facts and harm the futures of our offspring because its more convenient. We are hypocrites. We stand by and watch things go to shit because stopping it means risking luxery and convenience.

You pick an initial name on the charter. You can rename before turning the character in.

I hope they'll learn right at the start of character creation when they'll try to pull 3 lvl 1 mobs and get destroyed
---
Bank alts ftw!
---
I skipped most of the post once you said its impossible to clear rag week 1. It's very possible. It will take 5 or less IRL days at max efficiency to level and that leaves 2 days to farm rep and clear. I don't know if they have the dedication but it's very possible.
---
Speaking as a Brit... Fuck the British, I'm playing with my European buddies on Mirage Raceway.
---
I'm hoping we get both.  Give Classic two good years as an exclusive legacy product, then make separate BC servers with free transfers (or maybe free clones) from Classic and yes, sorry, merge the the now underpopulated Classic servers where needed.  Also make separate Classic+ servers with clones from the Classic servers, and go fucking nuts potentially reigniting the franchise long-term.  WotLK servers eventually, again as transfers or clones from BC.  Maintain each server type indefinitely.  
---
The only downside to this is the massive rush each server type has at release, which means either layering or server mergers after the rush.  Everyone gets to have their preferred game, and Blizzard gets to have hype subscription numbers every 1-2 years for like 6 years  in addition to their modern "retail" (we gotta find a new term for this pretty soon) product.
---
Some people find rushing fun.
---
Hahah gross. 
---
Espresso or those Starbucks monstrosities?
---
Because its 2019 and you need guide for everything. My personal favorite is still lvl 1 - 5 speedrun guide. So complex.

I recall hearing that they discovered a backup of the 1.12 client on an old drive hidden in some folders, and thats what Omar used to make the first working client.

Yeah it’s on there :)

No chance.

My levelling route is all darnassus rep quests in level ascending order and even as a human I'll maybe be halfway through revered at 60.
---
This isn't easy in classic.
---
I'm so jealous. Theres a couple people from my early wow days that I would say were huge in my development as a yound person. Theres ventrillo conversations that I can still remeber that eneded up advising important decisions later in my life. Unfortunately although I can remeber their voices clear as day, I cant rememebr any of their email adresses or even their character names. The email I used at the time has long since been abandoned, and I honestly can't even remember what server I was playing on at the time. I would love to get back in touch with these guys but I have no idea how to do it. 
---
If anyone reading this rememebers a human mage named Deuce who aoe grinded to 70 right after tbc came out, sende me a message man I miss you guys.
---
&gt; The endgame being exclusive to the more hardcore players is 
---
bad game design.  
---
There are difficulty modes for endgame content on retail. The best pieces, both for PVP and PVE are only for the best players. Having an Arena mount, titles from finishing a Raid before the release of more content, titles for doing extra stuff that takes a lot of effort and time, etc. All this fits on  " something that gave players something to look up to, and gave you a lot of social status within the game".  All this is possible, while allowing players who has less spare time, or don't have a competitive approach to the game, to still enjoy all the story of the game.  He won't have access to the best gear possible, or experience the hardest fights, but he will still be able to participate on the Siege of Orgrimmar, or helping defeat Sargeras.  
---
Spending millions to do some stuff that only part of the playerbase will have access is a pretty dumb way to burn money. I'm not talking about preferences, I'm talking about what is good/bad game design. Also, the point that matters is that the changes that makes retail a different game from classic, have almost nothing to do with LFG, still people see that as a symbol, and what makes retail what is today.
---
anyone else get triggered by the dwarf hunter not directly facing the wolf while attacking?

I bet Blaumeux will turn out to be the best server since most of the idiots avoided it because of the name.

Raiding is like spending years and tens of thousands of dollars on culinary school with the dream of creating new and exciting dishes, maybe one day owning your own restaurant or becoming a tv star. Then you graduate. You take on more debt to buy yourself the finest set of chef's knives money can buy. You apply. You're hired! Only to realize you're working at Applebees with 39 other line cooks. Your chef's knives are wasted, because in reality your job is nothing but microwaving hot pockets. Jake and Andy are bragging about how high they got in the walk-in cooler, but it's ok 'cause it doesn't affect them. Todd went to the bathroom without telling anyone again. Preston's dad didn't hug him, so he's making a lightswitch rave. XSephiroth and SephirothX (they say those are their real names) won't stop sexually harassing Karen, which explains why women never last three months at Applebees. Special Dave somehow managed to burn himself AND start a grease fire in a kitchen that only has microwaves, which is why he's Special Dave. So like I said, your job is to microwave hot pockets. You'll spend 4 hours on your own prepping fresh ingredients, then chuck them in the bin. Take your place with coworkers, hot pocket, and microwave, and you all have to press start on your microwave at the Same. Time. Maybe 5 people can mess up, or maybe Special Dave ruins it for everyone, but if it gets messed up, you all have to start over, and you're going to do this for the next four hours.
---
Oh, I forgot to tell you: Steve's the head chef. If he quits, the restaurant closes, and he's been spending a lot of time hanging out at TGIFridays lately.

I will repeat myself, as you obviously have a seriously inability to understand what you read:

&gt; 1- It makes the game easier  
---
&gt;The ones who say this, more often than not are the same who dislikes addons in general (and by now, we all should've learned to ignore the stupid people who still thinks addons should not be allowed). This is dumb, because intentionally waiting more time to play a game isn't a feature, and doesn't add a layer of difficulty. The challenge is about doing the dungeon/quest/raid, and not about spending 20+ minutes actively searching for another player. The dungeon will be the same, regardless if the players use this tool or not.

Well, tweak it a bit. Get rid of resilience. Tbh, get rid of arenas all together. I was more talking about all the great pve content that is available and "ready to go".

You can only share with people that are eligible to receive it. In the case of quest chains... not sure but I think the button is actually disabled when trying to share those.

Another example is sharing quests where the other person is too low level to receive. You'll get a chatbox message stating with who you attempted to share and whether or not that was succesful.

Your utility defines how effective you are. If you just stand mid in WSG you can get kills, if you roll with the flag carrier you may not top the table but you'll be able to make plays to directly affect the game.

HELP
---
I don’t understand the question. 
---
Enhance has a talent that allows you to use 2hand weapons. Otherwise all shaman can use the same weapons.
---
When you’re leveling solo you use a two hand as enhance spec. When you’re healing dungeons as enhance spec you’d then slap on a shield and 1h preferably with intel.
---
Lol... classic WoW was all about 2 choices, sacrificing your soul to the game for gear or using any damn thing you could lay your hands on, beating a mob to death with a fish you managed to catch three levels ago was still a victory.

Pvp gear is good for pvp as it has a high amount of stamina which is crucial for pvp. High warlord gear is equivalent to T2 and warriors would rather opt out to use that instead of T2. Other classes like mages dont need stamina so they rather have spell power

Swing timer, "most effective quest routes", looking for bis equipment where leveling, macros and who knows else, makes me look like a scrub not caring about any of this while leveling.

Not only that, but faster groups = finding more people faster =&gt; more odds of meeting players that you can bond.  
---
And that's a lot more social than "LF1M DPS/Inv please".
---
The problem is - 5k other people will do the same route while someone that does it on his own will have more success because he will skip some stuff or do others, that aren't in the guide.
---
To be honest people were ostracized quite a bit for being assholes back in classic too. I played on a RP-PVP server back then, and the community tracked known ninjas and honor farmers in the forums. There was a long blacklist of those kind of players. There was also lots of ridiculous drama too.
---
I'm really curious to see if it's really changed, or if it ends up being the same-old... I suspect we'll see a resurgence of loot ninjas as we'll be back to the old system again. (Cue that GTA SA meme...)

I mean, how else are you supposed to get it?  Just because something is a low droprate, doesn't mean it CAN'T drop.  It's all RNG man.
---
It is German and means "health."
---
Coincidentally there's also BiS in dungeons on retail too :)
---
thx Ivaden
---
You played yourself. Well done.
---
Was in the AMA
---
Well, that's what makes the item worth a lot of gold since not everyone enjoys grinding the same mobs for hours
---
What's so hard to understand, he doesn't write any macros on retail, he most likely does not play retail/have a retail client. That's why he's asking?
---
Watch out for the power of the Diet Double Dew.
---
I love how people always assume just because time went by we everything will be super easy. Sure people are much more used to play raid content but you had a fuckload of training back then as well.
---
We will see how it will go down. It's all assumptions people make right now.
---
Seems like a good bye never see u again type of letter. So dramatic.
---
The Hyacinth Macaw from the Pirates in STV comes to mind.
---
Well it was a pretty stupid thing to do .. but you can make another account. Just need to pay another sub
---
&gt;Not only that, but faster groups = finding more people faster =&gt; more odds of meeting players that you can bond.
---
Those arrows I hope don't mean you think those ideas are linked in some way. Speeding up dungeon group finding is the opposite of meeting players you can bond with.
---
Inappropriate language is still inappropriate  13 years later 
---
In future use  in game alternatives like "My naga's"
---
Okay, I half take it back, they do go to where they say eventually.
---
But why are they via youtube redirects instead of just linking directly?
---
Dungeon Cleave has never been faster than solo leveling. Many have tried, many have failed. It's just easier, it's NOT faster.
---
Without account sharing it's not humanly possible to down Rag before the end of the first week. There's been a multitude of posts much more detailed than this one breaking down why, from the physical limitations to the in game ones.
---
It literally isn't possible without account sharing.
---
Epic
---
True
---
I'm playing on my laptop, who needs those fancy pants dedicated GPUs anyway
---
&gt; Realistically the actual raid would take about 6-8 hours from the first boss kill but it's very far from being impossible.
---
Yeah, but that on top of leveling to 60 AND getting at least some gear to be able to down Majordomus (which is still a tough fight if your gear is bad - so you also would need 5 tanks) and Ragnaros.
---
So taking into account that people have to sleep and eat. I highly doubt it's doable.
---
Week 2 or 3? Definitely. First week? No.
---
So I would generally follow a talent levelling guide for enhance until sixty and then swap?
---
No problem. FYI it’s now 720!
---
There are so many players that even if 50% just dropped off, were still more populated than vanilla.
---
Lol I didnt say don’t eat candy and play games, i will be doing one of those... all I’m saying is if you have a morning routine that you think is healthy, that you should try not forget to do it instead of just waking and getting on wow lol
---
Launching today :)
---
Ha, I still have all of these too
---
Honestly I’m glad they hot fixed it
---
exactly
---
It is supposed to randomly drop for some lucker and not being "farmed"
---
Absolutely it's subjective but you can see quite clearly that compared to Classic and TBC the playerbase barely went up in WotLK despite the momentum it had coming off TBC and I'd attribute that to the expansions problems.
---
Technically the fastest /played 60 can only be reached by a casual who utilises rested exp bonus all the way to 60
---
Right?  I want to try that now.
---
Yeah, at least you have figured out what faction to play.
---
Horde is pretty cool though.
---
That too lol.

Im playing for an hour at release then going to bed cuz i work at 07.00 then gonna leave work early to get home and wake up my roommate then we start for real around 14.00 :P
---
I hear about the dramatic separations more than the happily ever afters. It's so lovely that, in your daughter's case, a whole family came from two people just playing a game :-)
---
Someone get this man a coffee.
---
I got work from 07:00-11:00 am then 5 days off work :)
---
Try looking up his character names or other known usernames on Google as well. People have a tendency to use the same usernames on other platforms as well, so you might be able to find him someplace where it's easier to get in touch. Good luck.
---
Do you know where can you find the 'Unclaimed Black Market Container'?
---
Edited for clarity
---
Works for runescape..
---
Thats why i have been awake for 20 hours already. So i can sleep easily now and wake up right before it starts
---
So if someone loves just lvling different characters or just going pvp that means you don't give a shit about the game? Come on man. The most fantastic thing about this game is that you have the freedom to do whatever you want and play the game however you want.

Doing all the Nelf quests will get you Honored, Max.

You can level as resto and it's not even bad. It's pretty much the same as leveling enhancement, you just miss out on 5% crit and Flurry. In exchange you get 3% spell and melee hit, and you can take the healing pushback protection thingy which is super convenient for leveling and mid-level PvP. Staves are some of the best weapons throughout the entire leveling process, so you don't even really need the 2h axe/mace talent from enhancement, nor do you have to level with a two-handed weapon at all. The DPS will be a bit less than enh but not so much that it seriously matters, you level the exact same way.
---
It releases tonight, at least in Europe. So obviously we wont sleep!

I see you have been grinding up your cooking skill. You know it resets when classic launches? right? ;P

20, not paying any attention to my studies. Eventually dropped wow early in TBC in order to finish them.
---
How would that save us repaircosts? Is the loss of durability only on death by outsite damage (NPC, falldamage etc) but not by "suicide through hellfire"?
---
Just go balance druid, its the best from both worlds.
---
Find Waldo! lol!!!
---
Ubrs isnt a raid, there is no id on it. You need to run lbrs several times to get the key though, since the 4 gems for the key-quest are "rare" drops, not guaranteed ones. You could get extremely lucky and get all 4 gems in a single run, or you might get fkd by rng and have to run lbrs 20 times to get all 4 gems. Statistically I'd say it takes atleast about \~4-5 runs.
---
The biggest problem I can see with this race is gear, there is simply no time at all to properly gear up from 5 mans (which is completely rng) to prepare for raids. A Tank with green/blue gear and a few random epic/t1 drops from the first run will get completely smashed by many bosses. Dps with green/blue levelling gear wont do half of the damage they could be doing in full prebis, and healers will go oom much faster. It seems necessary for them to finish the last \~5-10 levels with only dungeonfarming which should get most classes atleast somewhat properly geared up, but running dungeons like ubrs, strat and scholo with a full grp of underlevelled and undergeared players is going to be absolute hell and extremely inefficient and slow xp/h. The only reason some streamers in the beta made dungeons look so damn easy even when underlevelled is because they had full bis-gear, max level enchants and lots of consumables.
---
I don't know which sounds cooler, but I know which decision is pretty stupid. Making a big part of the game effectively out of the reach of everyone : Either you are wasting resources on a thing that almost none will ever see, or you aren't putting enough resources on it, and it won't be nearly worth the effort to the players.  
---
&gt; Raids that 90% of the playerbase steamrolled through, but with inflated numbers and a couple of new mechanics sounds just boring.   
---
That's because you are a elitist jerk, and don't see value on a raid, because there's an easy version of it.
---
Hell yeah. Can’t believing I’m seeing cake rn

I played the first month of beta with the built in gpu since my 1080 was RMAed. No problems at all. Could still use 3 monitors even.

It doesn't matter how good people are at raiding and pvp when you're trying to level up quickly.

Yes, I know. I could have sold my vanilla mage as well. Accounts with just similar equipt mages went for €1.200 - 2.000. Besides that I had 5 more lvl 60 alts. But I didn't sell my account.
---
The main reason was that this kind of behavior did not benefit the game and community. It did the opposite..
---
I know, I really wanted to play horde and I am going to create one. It's just that I wanted to have an alliance character since I know their characters pretty well. After about a week I'm going to create a horse character on another server tho.
---
Didnt Rift already do that? At least started the servers from scratch again.
---
You're probably better off, considering queues are definitely going to be several hours+ to begin with
---
It's funny. What makes me look forward to classic WoW the most is its slowed-down pace. But back in the day, I strongly felt that the game was too slow, that mounts came too late and that it was way too much of a hassle to get into dungeons and raids. Now I can appreciate these difficulties as blessings in disguise.

It gets worse though, you spend a few months grinding out heroic/mythic raids and mythic+ "for gear" then when the next raid comes out you can easily outgear that character on an alt in under a couple of weeks. I think to refer to this as catch up mechanics is understating how excessively it has been done.
---
I like the sentiment. But please don't give me free stuff or tell me how things are done. Treat me as any other. I want to experience the game the same way you did. I want to fail and be unknowledgeable about all the things just to get those "aha" moments. If you hold new players hand, how are you any better than Darnell.
---
Just strategically place NPCs around that will give you lifts to zones you otherwise wouldn't access. Lock each NPC behind their own quest(s) with a level req of 70. No more need to redesign zones.

I think you are limited to 5 dungeons per hour (maybe 10?) and the fastest way to reset is to use the macro /script ResetInstances();

My experience with RP server raiding in vanilla is that a lot of people just don't care about the min/max side of the game. They'll still raid, but expect a lot more hunters that just auto-shoot and AFK, or people with just weird ass builds because they don't have any sense of itemization/talents. Also there will be crazy people that fight shit in RP gear but that's a bit more rare.
---
Usually you'll find one hardcore guild that transfers or starts there specifically because they can get guaranteed server firsts.
---
The most hilarious moment I remember was one of the tryhard rogues in my guild topped the raid meters for an entire raid with level 1 daggers. That's what RP server raiding is like.

Not necessarily. If 10k people try to log into the server 45 mins before... then you end up in a queue. Once you're in a queue you won't get kicked. Technically you may be able to log in earlier and get in faster than most. This is theoretical of course, but still who knows?
---
5 hrs before launch
---
In retail :)
---
Maybe not the newest expansion, but if you don't own any version, what would one be subscribing to?
---
No the bags available from quests do not suffice. You want 4 bags asap. Period. You buy 4x 6s bags from the AH and you will have made that money back in an hour. Same thing with 14s bags later on.
---
If you wait for a lucky drop or get the 4s bag reward at lvl 10 or so in Westfall, it means you lost dozens of silver already in destroyed loot.
---
I think they might have played another kinda game too i guess, dont give WoW all the credit 😂
---
Thats really good man
---
Probably the best comment on this matter.
---
Also the original statement might be true only if you're into pve. In that case going slow might actually work better because by that time there will be established guilds ready to gear dedicated people up cause some of their initial members might burn out by then.
---
If you're into pvp then every day you don't progress means that you're likely to meet opponents with at least rank 10 sets by the time you're 60. No match for your quest greens :/

You can heal 5 man's up to 60 as enhance or ele. And at 60 there are good builds for both to be hybrid healers and fun in pvp.

I've got in contact with old  guildmates (which are mostly real life friends) and decided we would  commit ourselves once again to the ''real world'' haha. We all come from  different servers , most of us are Dutch and some Danish, while we  remaining a English guild. We raided seperatly , eventualy at the later  phases of vanilla we transfered to one realm and started raiding and  pvping together., reaching end game. While we would like to play as much  as we can ,real life gets in the way ;) We will get there, but in time.  For this  all to happen we need a larger playerbase!
---
* Majority of the current members got expierence in end game PvE and PVP ( tier 1-2.5 &amp; up to rank 14)
---
* Majority of the current members got work or study making no life-ing impossible.
---
* We aim for both PvE and PvP, having 1 event **each** a week.(expect groups runninng pve &amp; pvp all day though)
---
* We provide a social and a organized community.
---
* You can bring friends/fam/gf's who maybe never reach 60.
---
Starting  to get interested, hit me up and I would like to get in contact over  voice for any questions or just a chat.Hope to see you in Azeroth
---
(guild to be named by vote)
---
Sincerely,Repeace
---
But hard to have time for both at the same time. At least for me.
---
Should push it past Anthem then
---
Arenas are the whole reason I'm even playing classic lol. The devs hinted in the Q &amp; A that their plan is to make TBC and then Wrath, and I loved TBC arenas.
---
All you need is a 5 years odl CPU if you want something more running in the background besides the game, I have my mainboard in repair so I'm using Phenom II x3 and Radeon 5770 HD so 8 years old PC, I can only use one tab on my browser with WoW running, with few tabs has some problems but I'm guessing it's because right now I'm on HDD since my new PC utilizes nvme ssd, probably with ssd I wouldn't tell the difference.
---
Especially the first week. A lot of players are going to want to hit 300 enchanting asap to start farming out the end game enchanting recipes. So greens and cloth I imagine are going to be high value items.
---
As someone who also deals with this kind of thing, you're right that they'll be casting a wide net, but they will definitely have specific targeting for people who have brought or shown interest in buying gold in the past.
---
I can't help but look at all these 'prep' pics and notice they're predominantly American..(hot pockets). Every Euro I know has meal prep'd actual meals.

---
I feel like people that've played on privateservers will be the real MVP's of classic.
---
Alot of people talk about ''back in the day''. Well i've been playing vanilla for like 10 years so good luck haha
---
Every single piece of content in WoW, since Vanilla, has been made irrelevant in later tiers to a different degree. Vanilla and BC slightly less so, but anywhere else? Yep.
---
Are people getting add ons lol. It’s not hard at all. Part of the experience
---
There's lots of incentive to rush through the game for many people. People are allowed to enjoy that part as well. If I had the time if definitely be one of those people, since I've seen it all already. Being the first to kill stuff and get good gear is what some people enjoy. 
---
For me this time will be extremely slow though, but I will still try to level decently fast as I enjoy the stuff at 60 a lot.
---
Actual pride and accomplishment.
---
No, have to do it in me zone. But if she don't mind running, might as well just go and join you. Have to run that way anyway at some point :) 2nd she will just have fightpaths so it's easier

I'm a dev, I know how stuff works, and I know what they can/cannot do on this aspect of the API.

---
All you are seeing here is stopping points for teirs of guilds. 
---
For the lower end raiding guilds Vael was the grim reaper by this point of wow, you probably were not great at the game if you were hitting Vael when Naxx was out and a single person could wipe the raid. 
---
For guilds that cleared BWL finally and were working on AQ Twin Emps/Huhuran would take a loonnng time there probably wasn't a ton of guilds grinding huhuran at this point that ended up killing C'thun. 
---
Patchwerk is just that for Naxx, the funnel point where if you are in Naxx a lot of guilds are going to get through the easy bosses and get stuck on him.
---
I second that. The retail raid frames are pretty good. 
---
Can you use all mouse button combinations with macros like you can with clique?

Well I’m sorry if this sounds condescending but I think we all should tell other people not to eat shit and crap foods. 
---
If you eat crap you get sick and other people have to carry more weight and pay more.
---
Sure one dude eating crap is fine, but it’s not a good example to set for kids, and they’re gonna look up to you and be jealous of all your shit food.
---
And then those kids are gonna buy shit food, Red Bull drinks, Coca Cola or whatever.

I’m not saying you should sit behind your desk with a fucking crop of lettuce, just that there’s other foods and drinks that are better for you.

Can’t, most healthy food tastes like butthole wrapped in nut sweat.
---
I ALREADY CRAVE THE NEXT, WHERE IS IT!?
---
Things like dailies are fine imo. The problem for me was Mythic+, I have never found doing dungeons over and over again fun, in past expansions I did them for the first few weeks to gear for raiding and that's it, never did them again unless there was some specific reason to like frozen orbs. But then Blizzard started pushing Mythic+ as an esport and they purposefully made changes to try and kill raiding and now the game is grinding repetitive shitty dungeons over and over again to stay competitive with gear from that slot machine. That's why I quit, I refused to do those garbage dungeons for a chance at BiS gear that should have been coming from a raid and so I fell behind on gear. That's the main reason I want to play classic too, no Mythic+, no bullshit changes with terrible excuses to try and kill raiding and most gear is what it is and once you've got it you've got it.
---
Staysafe's guide is from P-server which are based off tBC rep values which are much much higher.
---
If you read comments on the videos you'll see people are several thousand rep of finishing it. And even on Private servers as Human they are over 40 and needing Carried trough Ferelas which requires 42+ just to accept the quests to get it.
---
So you’re saying I should throw out the $150 of junk I just bought or....?
---
Half the fun of vanilla wow was the leveling.  Having a busy schedule doesn’t exclude you from being able to play classic.  It’ll be fun enough just leveling and playing when you can.  I would just not recommend playing if you don’t have self-control and playing will make you neglect more important obligations.

&lt;Rainfall&gt; [A] | NA-Herod PvP | Tues / Wed 8-11pm EST | Semi-HC | Predetermined Loot Council
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Raid times are Tuesday &amp; Wednesday @ 8:00 PM – 11:00 PM ET. Monday will be our optional clean-up day when necessary.
---
About Us:
---
&lt;Rainfall&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild looking for mature players for the upcoming classic PvE content. We are currently recruiting all classes with a focus on players motivated to make sufficient preparations before raids. Our goal is to do clear all PvE content efficiently without forcing our players to play more than their schedules allow.
---
Member Expectations:
---
Members are expected to contribute to raids as much as they can. Raiders who want to stand out should come prepared and on time with consumables, buffs, enchants, etc. Exceptional quality raiders will be given preference for invites and gear during progression. Our first goal is to quickly reach 60 and enter MC with as many members as possible. Full clear can be expected before week 6.
---
Loot Distribution:
---
Since all loot in classic is already known, we will be using a predetermined loot council with priority of each item based on role and class. This way there is less bias towards specific members and each item can be given to those who benefit the raid the most. Any suggestions and concerns are open for discussion before raiding begins. 
---
Available Roles:
---
* Healer Druid
---
* Balance Druid
---
* Hunter
---
* Mage
---
* Healer Paladin
---
* Ret Paladin
---
* Healer Priest
---
* Shadow Priest
---
* Dagger Rogue
---
* Warlock
---
* Fury Warrior
---
* OT Warrior

Whole point of wow classic is to min max the duck out of everything as you know all the future buffs etc and duck over everyone as you become the chosen one using your 15 years o experience.
---
It's like going back to school but keeping all your knowledge. It's the beta males wet dream!
---
&gt;Flying: The fact that people can get on their mounts and just fly up ruins world pvp.
---
Factually wrong. World PvP was already dead when flying mounts were introduced. It died with Battlegrounds.
---
&gt; Continuity of items: Letting the hardest to achieve gear in the game be replaced by questing greens 
---
It didn't. The hardest to achieve gear (Naxxramas), with some exceptions like weapons, was good enough for Karazhan.
---
&gt; Legendary items with lots of lore behind them should not be replaced by questing greens. 
---
Bullshit.
---
Thunderfury was good enough that Kunged used it while tanking Illidan, in the THIRD tier of TBC raiding.   
---
Sulfuras was bad enough that it didn't even last Vanilla, by the end of BWL it was already obsolete, so let's not talk about it
---
Atiesh was on par with Karazhan loot (slightly weaker for the single character, but the aura made up for it for group content), so not replaced by greens.
---
&gt; The world got smaller: We went from an entire planet, spanning two continents, to like 6 zones in TBC. 
---
No we didn't. Low level zones weren't used in Vanilla either at max level.
---
I don't remember being around Westfall or Redridge or Badlands or Loch Modan back at 60. There was nothing there for me.
---

---
Yeah, casters can be really fun
---
"He waved back! That means he wants to fight!" *proceeds to gank the waver*
---
And no damn "link achievement / curve" :D
---
tried out tanking deadmines a couple of month ago on a private server.
---
was a complete mess, had no idea that battle shout apparently is good for getting aoe threat, priest kept pw:shielding me even though i told him not to,...
---
we still managed to beat it though
---
ElvUI and TukUI are both available for Classic ([www.tukui.org](https://www.tukui.org)) 
---
\+ there are already a ton of edits made available for classic, this right here being my favorite: [RedtuzkUI](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=6)
---
Many addons that work for retail already have a classic version, including things like Details!, BigWigs etc. etc.
---
Questie is available as well!
---
I fell asleep thanks to some bud but fuck me theres still 12 hours to go.

Fuck you i eat what i want
---
Cant imaging an RP realm without all the world PVP! Zandalar Tribe FTW!
---
that's scary. I bought a 2080 RTX last week.
---
8am tomorrow morning is when classic goes live here in aus mate
---
Though once everyone is super geared, no one is.
---
Would love it if classic cycled on to TBC, then Lichking, then reset back to classic.

One of these is not like the others....
---
Congrats for "Ja"! I didn't even know you could have two-character names.
---
I played WoW on a Asus netbook with an early atom cpu during WotLK, so anything goes!
---
Well actually it is. You’re always setting an example and if someone’s setting a wrong example I think it’s fine to tell them about it.
---
&gt;Current classic with more content, raids, end game items, dungeons, maybe balance fixes, tweaks, better/more unique itemization, community driven implementations, etc.  
---
&gt;tbc /wotlk arena is the best state wow PVP has ever been in . wouldn't mind that. especially s8 when everything was viable.
---
Replace pve with bfa players
---
Consideration for what? BG's queued you right up from the very beginning. Y
---
and threaten to cut the cable
---
good times

"Binds when worthy"
---
Good. I'll get a good price out of it from the AH then.
---
My character had a sex change so definitely seen some shit.
---
You nasty
---
Dude in my league drafted Lamar Miller and Luck earlier I'm the afternoon. Whoops.
---
Which healer would be best with a warrior tank?
---
I agree. Being able to search topics like in a forum is something Discord lacks.
---
Shazzrah on EU. I know it's full but I'm not going to play till 3-4 past launch and if there were queues I would change my realm.
---
Alliance - PvE 
---
Looking for a place that doesn’t force raid attendance and is okay with busy adults that get a couple hours here, a couple hours there.
---
Just want to enjoy the nostalgia and experience all over again at my own pace.
---
I’ll be focusing on dungeons, crafting, and casual battlegrounds.  
---
Open on realm.
---
Huh? Replied to the wrong comment? 🙂
---
My goal is to not rush it or get too addicted... But damn I don't know what will happen when I first step into it lol.
---
Google interest in Classic is higher than now than retail ever was in the last 5 years, except for WoD launch. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=world%20of%20warcraft,wow%20classic

Ah the cancer stick diet. You must not care that people value you on this earth. Nice.
---
One summer back in vanilla, I had severe back problems. At the age of 15.

Tank for us, we'll appreciate you. If you have questions, ask anyone. &lt;3

Bruh no one really understands me... I'm basically a tauren druid IRL, but more wise and handsome.
---
Besides Kargoz, if you prefer something more streamlined / written in a website format, check out  [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/) , tons of great info on most things classic-related!
---
I had a GM back in the day who ran away to be with her boyfriend. She stopped playing on EU servers and went to America lol.
---
lol I just moved from Whitemane to Skeran last night and it was Medium. Figured I would get shorter ques and I could get the name for my Priest that I wanted ( WOLOLO). Won't be long until BLaumerux is high.
---
Yeah man, I hope the stress test was not a unique experience that way.
---
May the light have mercy on your sphincter.
---
For PvP if alliance in order of impact in bgs: Paladin (healer), Druid (heal/feral hybrid for flag carrying / supporting), Warrior (especially when paired with a paladin), priest (offensive dispels), mage, rogue, warlock, hunter
---
Aspect Of The Pack gives everyone in X amount range 35% more movement speed.
---
But you get Dazed if you get hit.
---
Damn, missed that completely. Thanks man.
---
Btw, what is the realm restart anyway (havent played the game since 2006)?  
---
Just a regular reboot I would assume, with no effect on us except the downtime?
---
Magically turn on yes but you will get kicked after 30 mins on the character selection screen.
---
My SO threw me down an endless spiral yesterday by saying. 
---
''Oh btw i decided we can go horde.''
---
He convinced me to play alliance and now 2 days before release he says this....
---
All my plans, class and race choice basically everything I had prepared just thrown away.
---
I'm not sure if i will be able to stay sane with making my class and race choice once again in a much shorter time.
---
Pretty sure 2 divided by 2 equals 1, 2/2=1 yep it checks out.
---
I changed mine last night
---
You will get kicked no matter what you do once you’ve been sitting at that screen for 30 minutes.
---
I'm going to be completely useless at work Tonight, I've got TeamViewer set up with a friend to keep me logged in while I'm there
---
Doing all the quests. Questing down through ashenvale. Then tons of weeds and runecloth.
---
It was such a hassle back in the day, xplay’s Morgan Webb talked about the world first (or first known) gnome who got their nightsaber...and the subsequent 30k trips back and forth to do it.
---
do you ever tell people you met in a prison?
---
oh yeah like 2 apples gonna fix that

And your diabetes too.

&lt;Lux Vult&gt; - Pagle [US - EST - ALLIANCE]  
---
We are recruiting members to join our semi-casual raid team. We're an EST timezone raid guild rolling on Pagle server!
---
Some notable points about who we are and what we're looking for;
---
We're Semi-Casual. Meaning that we'll be raiding two days a week. We're going to be running on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Raid times will be 7pm EST to 11pm pst.
---
Along with being semi-casual, we understand that people aren't going to be wholly dedicated to just the game and as such, we won't have any hard set requirements. However Vanilla has their own, so simple things like not being attuned, is entirely on you. However we won't be enforcing things like full enchants and consumables. That being said, we do expect people to show up prepared for the short amount of time we have to raid each week. Therefore under performance and constant issues will likely get you sat for someone else. The onus is entirely on you as to who much or little effort you want to put in. Being on time and ready for our short raid schedule is key however.
---
We'll be running Loot Council. Show up, contribute and get loot.
---
"Meme" specs are welcome. As mentioned before raid performance is considered, but raw dps is rarely a deciding factor. If you're constantly dead or causing issues, I don't care what spec you are, you'll be sat. Presently we are seeking everything except for Ret Pallies and Prot Warriors. All others are encouraged to apply!
---
We're in need of hunters, Warlocks and Rogues for sure.
---
If you have additional questions and/or are interested in talking to us about joining, send me a PM here on Reddit, add me on on discord (Respect#4560) or join our discord and ask for an officer! (https://discord.gg/MzNcJjb)
---
Blood and Thunder brother, thank you!
---
some people want the original vanilla experience, that includes a ton of addons.
---
I really wanna go Gnome for my rogue but this racial makes me feel like I need to go human for the potential dps boost in raids.
---
There is no rogue spec that works well in both pvp and pve.
---
Shut up and do what I tell you! :P
---
I dunno. I wouldn't call 16% of all-time peak interest a blip. But I was mainly pointing out its comparison to recent Wow interest. Blows it out of the water.
---
That's it!
---
Yea being a part of an mmo fresh release is always an experience
---
Thought it was the 27th? Or are you talking midnight?
---
Is that just party members or everyone in your faction?
---
Every molten core pull ever: "Okay pull, wait for sunders.... Pact... Pact...Pact!.. PACT! TURN OF THE ASPECT OF THE FUCKING PACT YOU GOD DAMNED ARROW SLINGING BUMBLEFUCKS!"
---
As a warrior hit me up with that int even if I cant buff you!
---
Int helps me raise weapon skills!
---
I get that now. Just saying, from the screenshot it seemed otherwise. It sounds like something someone would post here so it wouldn't shock me.
---
I would like to play on a medium or low pop  pvp server. It isn't like I have that option right now through.
---
How is he wrong? Look at the link he posted. He will have 8 total weapon skill... 5 from being human and 3 from the talent. This means he glances 40% of the time for 5% penalty.
---
I'd appreciate the PDF too!
---
!remind me 6 days
---
The answer is always yes.
---
Play whatever your first class was when you first played WoW.
---
It was the stess test, and you could only get to lvl 15.
---
I couldnt help myself, I just kept playing and playing. Im not a 'ahead of the pack' pushing kinda guy.
---
Party members
---
A raid will easily have 6-8 mages and only 3-4 warlocks, so it's actually quite easy getting a raid spot as a mage, a good guild is always recruiting them.
---
Mages also have utility in pvp/dungeons, not sure what point you're trying to make.
---
you saying that helps
---
Felhunters are designed to be anti-casters.  They are specialized.  As a result, they do terrible damage compared to a succubus or imp.
---
Hunter pets, on the other hand, are both tanky and do great damage.  Hunter pets aren't made to be swapped out for a battle; they are meant to be generic enough for any encounter.  A hunter pet can (probably?) solo an even level monster... no warlock pet can even do that.
---
So to just grant a massive resist boost on top of a tanky, damage dealing pet is overpowered.  There would be no "chink in the armor".
---
If I am correct, your pet will aggro mobs in dungeons, thus pulling the whole dungeon.
---
It is funny the first time. Not so much the following times.
---
-cheers
---
Partymembers. But it becomes a real annoyance in BG's, dungeons and raids
---
Aspect of the Cheetah gave the hunter a speed boost when he ran at the cost of dazing him for several seconds if he took damage while the Aspect was on.
---
Aspect of the Pack did the same thing for the *entire group*
---
Nothing like a Hunter who forgot Pack was on in an instance with you, far away from the battle and taking no damage, but causing the entire party to be dazed and get wrecked while ignoring the chat as all four other players are telling him TURN YOUR ASPECT OFF!!
---
Pretty sure the new client has that built in? I remember using it in wotlk so the legion client classic is using should definitely have it.
---
The attunement quest requires level 55, I've seen screenshots of level 57s in there too in vanilla. But I would be willing to bet that at least 5 guilds kill Rag in the first week since I know of at least that many that have been practicing MC in greens/leveling and have 60-100 members each prepared to do this.
---
Ok cool thanks!
---
Welcome to Ironforge, members of the Alliance. 
---
This proud city will once more be at the frontline of the fight against the menace from Blackrock Mountain.
---
I don't have to imagine!
---
First off. I hate you for having car play. God I wish I had it so much. But my car is one year before it with the stupid as fuck Chevy stereo software you have to pay them $165 or more to update.
---
LOL
---
Questie is all you need tbh
---
No one is leveling a Warrior or a Priest to 60 in less than 3 days /played. I'm sorry but you're just wrong.
---
Even if it was 3 days /played exactly....it's /played. That's more than 3 actual days.
---
There's bathroom breaks, sleep breaks, eating breaks, stretching and walking around so you don't fatigue yourself etc. Those little minutes add up over time.
---
If someone downs Rag week one I'll eat my own head.
---
While not seamless (as it utilizes "instance gates" to travel between zones) GW2 generally has really nice and pretty zones, even a lot of hidden content built in like jumping puzzles, hidden caves with goodies and stuff like that.
---
Hi Vark, my friends and I also thought about this. Which server are you guys playing on? We are Priest (me), Warri and Rogue
---
Dude that’s a mage. The last thing I need is another option hahaha
---
Don’t overthink it. Warlocks are great, so are rogues. You’ll end up making both anyway. 
---
Classic is going to be here for a long time. There’s no rush or need to pick “one” character ahead of time
---
It's not totally true though. At least world pvp
---
Melderon's guides are great but if you prefer something more focused / in a text format, check out what I wrote in the [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-shaman-pvp-guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-shaman-pvp-guide) or any of the other leveling / PvE shaman guides :) happy frost shocking!
---
That's okay, you can comment even though you're salty, i dont judge m8
---
See you in classic!
---
Shut up about shit people are probably going to do if they're a functioning member of society anyway
---
Ew
---
Not defending the rest of the post, but he was stating that in both cases you need 6% hit from gear to hit cap, so if you have that gear the extra points dont matter (for hit chance)
---
Two months ago I met a new player leveling in pandaria and we gruped up. No achievments, asked some basic question, I really envied him. Then I noticed he has heirlooms... on his first character. Turns out some asshat told him around level 10 that he NEEDS heirlooms for good leveling so the poor soul forked out money for a token and got full set of heirlooms. Already in pandaria he was saying how he enjoyed leveling and once max level will go back and finish other zones...
---
Psh, that looks nothing like Elwynn Forest.
---
Damn if I had to eat those while playing WoW I’d probably just do something else
---
Hunter and mage are both really fun on BGs. Hunter has alot more fun in AB than WSG due to room to kite.
---
As a rogue you will sit in novas and slows fully doted most of the time if you dont choose your fights right. Sometimes you just wait there in stealth 30sec for your window...waiting...and waiting...
---
Rogue is more fun when there are not many ppl around.
---
&gt;So my question is are warlocks fun? I feel like I’m overthinking this but I don’t want to pick the wrong class here!
---
Rolling Warlock..super fun, have useful pets, fast levelers, great utility (Summon is a god send in Vanilla).
---
Everything I’ve seen says glancing blows cap at 5% dmg reduction at 308. Do you have proof of the contrary?
---
Got the name Bob on one server, a few days later my friend told me they are switching to another server.. then someone had taken the name Bob on that new server.. feelsbadman
---
'Other shit' Like what? Running MC for Thunderfury does not make it relevant. There are mounts you can get in the current ish raids that you can do. They're as relevant as MC.
---
IIT Despite linking a very respectable source and being absolutely correct... people telling OP he is wrong.
---
-1 no Thex
---
I too am a man of simple culture
---
500k
---
Softballz and Grindpa are the only ones you maybe couldn't use on an RP server I think.
---
Seems like English is indeed not your first language
---
RP is for dorks.
---
I slept like a baby. Not like I could play before I could wake up.
---
I'm a waver, often to my detriment. 
---
 You see some dude at low health fighting a mob, wave to be nice and not gank him. A coupe of minutes later the same dude you spared ganks you while you are at low health grinding mobs or sitting down eating. Story of my life.
---
Glorious shit post
---
Bruh the memes will stop when we can play the damn game instead
---
For everyone wondering: Chicken, rice, lenses, flat peach, half kiwi and a mixture of carrotts, corn, cauliflower and green peas 😊
---
In addition I made 3 chicken wraps with salad, sprouts and a selfmade sauce.
---
yeah that was my thought, cuz on private server it felt way too easy, thanks for the heads up :)!
---
I'm settled on rogue just not on the race. 
---
Do I go Human for the meta racials, gnome for the memes, nelf for the better stealth/highest agility or dwarf for stoneform and treasure hunting.
---
That data is wrong to begin with.
---
 In patch 1.12 with 300 weapon skill vs 315 defense you will have 40% glancing with 35% dmg reduction. 
---
Weapon skill lowers both the chance and dmg reduction.
---
Intel Lava Lake processors next? 🤔
---
Mate that was fucking beautiful. Are you a fuckin shaman or someshit?
---
You will be able to see our stream here

---
well, launch is at 00:00 here in europe, not gonna start there, get up early tomorrow, leave office earlier, and start playing at around 5 PM. so 17 hours after launch. 
---
why again was i planing my vacation before the classic launch date was announced?
---
How is he wrong? Looks right to me.
---
Damn....
---
It's not "slightly too strong", there is nothing slightly. It's gamebreaking. And the raid isn't really "challenging" it's time consuming. Those are two very different things.
---
A Naxxramas geared warlock could instakill someone with a single Unstable Affliction tick. I've seen it crit for 5400 damage. That's not slightly too strong, it's gamebreaking.
---
If the new stuff doesn't offer better gear people aren't gonna bother. If the gear is better it'll get to absurd pretty quick.  
---
Thing is, with gear improvements, it has to be greater and greater if it has to be meaningful.  
---
Going from +2 to +4 str is massive, going from +20 to +22 is "meh who cares".
---
As much as people didn't like it a gear reset every once in a while is required, and the way Blizzard handled it, pairing it with a new lvl cap is rather elegant.
---
There is up to a 48 hour delay with PayPal. They warn you when you pay. I will say I’ve never had it take for than a few hours.
---
It's medium, but I'm sure it will be at least on high just before launch and on full after launch. If Lucifron or whatever the other PvP server is should indeed get hours of queue time, I can see many people jumping to Venoxis instead.
---
I was dead set on playing a rogue for months. After hearing there where two other rogues, a dps warrior and hunter in my playgroup i didn't want to compete with so many of my friends for gear, let alone with randoms. I thought of what rogue gameplay lacks wich i would enjoy. I realised i want to be useful for my group with more than raw dps, so i ended up with shaman. I don't mind healing and in pvp i will roast faces as elemental, wich looks really rewarding. After this process i'm really happy with my choice and i probably won't even go with a rogue as second character.
---
\^ doesn't want to farm in classic, you playin the wrong game version brotha,
---
What's your suggestion for how they could do it better?
---
You're not alone bud. 
---
In fact I'm using this week to cut hard. I'm like 20% bodyfat bearmode so just gonna fast all week, to avoid having to spend time cooking or eating. Already 24 hours fasted and just pulled 2mmol/L blood ketone just now on my KetoMojo sticks so I'm ready to goooooo. Nothing like eating bodyfat for every meal all week.
---
somewhere  750k - 1M. If everyone could get straight in the game I would say 1M, but no one is going to want to watch people sit in que.
---
Yeah I can see that one being taken quite quickly :P
---
Yeah also lots of DBZ/NGE amvs :D
---
Bin auch schon am Start, wenn Blizzard aber keine zusätzlichen Realms dazu packt, hocken wir selbst auf Venoxis erstmal bis morgen früh in der Qeue :D
---
Great comment. As you said, communication is key. If a certain room has a horrible layout, just make a plan to pull the enemies back out of that room. Marking targets for CC is super-useful and will save you loads of wipes.
---
Lok’Tar Ogar, brother!
---
Death watches you
---
Yep. Dropped it at a few parties. It always gets a solid reaction. Honestly, people are usually more surprised when I tell them we met in WoW.
---
Think he will play mage?
---
Too much roughage, your poop-socks are going to be the things nightmares are made of.
---
Ye fk the nost people and the petitions lets all thank chromie
---
vanilla was catered alot to hardcore ppl who had a serious amount of time where nothing had bullshit lockouts and if u put down the time u get the rewards. :)
---
I don’t think I’ll be seeing any horse later today lmao
---
I'm sure they busted a tavern or in. Badguys pike nice things too
---
You underestimate swordyman's power
---
At least you can't purge travel form.
---
Wenn die Leute heute Abend in der 30.000er Warteschlange hängen werden sicher einige noch auf die anderen Server gehen.
---
Don’t ruin this for me.
---
If you don’t show it off, did you really do it?
---
No, it's a dick move if you disrupt other people's RP.  There is nothing wrong with not RPing on an RP server, just like there is nothing wrong with RPing an on non-RP server.
---
Now that you mention it, yeah DBZ was big, but probably a few years before that for peak viewership on American TV.
---
Didn't mean to respond to your comment. Anyway, I have 3 I have to keep up to date so the export funktion is pretty neat.
---
He describes it as a fast-paced action packed game more akin to Diablo 2 than its contemporaries, with basically no grinding and a beautiful and detailed world. So funny that people seem to now think that V. WoW is this insanely hard game with lots of grinding x'D
---
lmao WOLOLO is a name your read and hear at the same time. Excellent choice
---
Alot less realms so inherently it should be so. Was vanilla seriously able to hit 8 million though?
---
Great compilation!
---
I feel you! i'm going to bed 4 hours earlier than usual, just to wake up 3-4 hours before work to play a little... Can't wait until weekend and it's only monday. Rip
---
Maybe, maybe he's worried about tanking. I know i used to get that way so I'd avoid certain classes.
---
Raid ready.
---
Unless you are a mage then the rogue is probably just running away.
---
&gt; I never said it wasn't a scumbag thing to do. And no, you can certainly  decide that it's not worth the money. That still doesn't give you an  excuse to steal from him. 
---
Well, the good thing is that I only have to deal with my inner demons about stealing from someone doing scumbag moves. 
---
&gt; Ask the FBI. They think [differently](https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/white-collar-crime/piracy-ip-theft) 
---
I don't care what they think, along with many other people pirating it and other things like movies/msuic in this case.
---
Nobody here is dealing with the legality of what they're doing, but rather if they can live with stealing content from someone who've decided to put a paywall behind it.
---
i definitely think so too. thx
---
The whole point of this is keeping it exactly the way it was. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Happy Birthday!
---
No ffs he said
---
&gt;Then try to not fail and get knocked off by the cannonballs on your way to the boat.
---
Which is why I referenced cannonballs instead of a Canon. It makes no sense to think the door opening one is from cataclysm
---
I actually think those are the best levels.
---
You have your core class spells, you're probably outfitted in decent greens and blues, you have so many zones to explore and level in (STV, Arathi, 1k needles, hillsbrad, the marsh, the swamp, tanaris, desolace, feralas, Etc. Etc. Etc.) and you get to run some of the best pre-levelcap dungeons (Scarlet Monastery). 
---
It's only after 48-50 or so that it gets really painful with running out of easy quests and lvl 60s farming you for Honor.
---
You’ll get ~5000/21000 into revered at lvl 40 if you do all nelf zones. A couple k more from feralas+y quests. 
---
It’s worth it if you want to get exalted though, since you’ll save yourself a shit ton of cloth needed for the turnins
---
I like Kevin Jordans idea, but I think new content goes against what the Classic-philosophy is. The idea is to *re*make something from the past, not to create something new. Classic+ goes against that. It would be cool, but the moment you make Classic+ you take away the original game experience. 
---
If you do that, people will flock to vanilla private servers once again and we might have another Nostalrius.
---
I think it's better to just make new fresh realms that starts on stage 1.
---
This is pretty cool, i like the idea of the braille for the name. Maybe change the font color to orange to represent a legendary then for the equip maybe make it "renders the wielder blind but greatly increases all other senses" or something like that to match the flavour of a blind samurai
---
We're finally going home boys. These last 11 hours can not to any faster!
---
make it separate imo
---
Pretty sure they’re just all grouped.  I could see PvP server and PvE server groupings, but I’d be surprised if it’s not just everybody in one pool.
---
The players who don't move to classic are weak, their bloodlines are weak, and they will not survive the winter.
---
I'd go dwarf in a heartbeat if I were alliance.
---
Queue times dont really = shit show. The last few launches were smooth as butter with zero server issues.
---
Happy 24th birthday!
---
Only 1000 in queue? Oh you poor naive little thing
---
I smoked 20lbs of Boston butt for my Keto meal prep
---
This guy doesn't pvp
---
old pserver values are old
---
Its like a dance. You have to tab target and pool rage and sunder the right mobs at the right times. Its fun to pull off well.

For levelling I'd go standard affliction and feral, that'd be a dream combo, tank and mass dots with the odd heal would be able to just kill forever with very little downtime. Use voidy as well and you're going to be killing at least 3 mobs at all times, after practice and some decent items you'll be more like 5 mobs at all times (pet+dots, fear+dots, 2-3 on druid+dots with the warlock peeling one off occasionally.

My son is due this upcoming Saturday! Drek'thar Peter and Thrall Brayden pals for life LOL

Ah yes, the first of many who waited until the day of and is having issues.
---
Priest, mage or warrior?! This is stressful
---
Hahahaha the Warrior Whirlwind quest is what got me. God damn that was rough to do at the earliest possible levels.
---
Once the dust settles, and the bfa/new people realise they cant just dump all their cds at the beginning of a pull, it'll be fine. If youre pugging, let the group know they need to give you a few seconds to build threat on bigger packs (especially if a paladin). Remember to ask for saps/traps if your group is undergeared.
---
You'll get a hang of it as you go, keep a positive attitude and learn from your mistakes
---
Unless the entire server has taken the day off work/school I doubt it will be that bad.
---
I love it.
---
Make sure you’re using the right account (like wow1 wow2 etc). I bought game time and couldn’t log into classic; then I realized I was on the wrong sub account
---
\*didn't spots the 4 Undead Rogues in stealth\*
---
... did someone say ...
---
Preis -Leistung Top 👌
---
I honestly have no clue. I spent like 12 hours a day on WoW then spent my 8 hours in high school talking about WoW with my friends who I played with. Rinse and repeat for like 2 years straight lol.
---
No, it just means that people who search for terms related to classic wow have a higher probability of wanting to buy gold than people who search for terms related to retail wow.
---
I lift and do cardio...So I can binge eat junk food for moments like this
---
I guess that's fair.  Its just the design seemed somewhat generic and half-assed to me.  I'm not trying to be overly critical.  I enjoy retail WoW.  I think BFA, overall, is a beautiful game aesthetically.  The view from atop Dazar Alor is amazing.
---
&gt;I loved tbc, but i don't feel like doing 15 years of  wow again.
---
Time is a flat circle, you know.
---
Seems this town isn't big enough for the both of us.. Pinhead Larry!
---
at this point it's just a meme, I don't think most people who say that actually thought about it.
---
I was 8 :'( only bought wow when I was 10.
---
I remember the only time I could really do an opening and play the whole night was WoD release. I stacked up on junkfood and then realized after 1 bag of chips and sweets that my belly hurt already lmao. So now I'll plan it differently
---
Yeah I don't own either of those , so I'm wondering can I get away with only a sub , cause when I tried entering classic it just said you need active game time in order to play.
---
And just pray to God that someone sees it for the full 0.6 seconds that it's visible.
---
dann bin ich hoffentlich schon level 10+
---
I can't sleep halp
---
You press bloodthrist, you press whirlwind, you use excess rage with heroic strike. when that execute buttons lights up you break that button by mashing it as hard and fast as you can.
---
The game arrived in 2005. Yeah, on board will probably get 60 frames on classic graphics
---
Druid tanking = farm MCP and spam maul and watch how nobody comes close to you in TPS.
---
I don't want to be that guy but I find TBC boring.
---
Statistically... maybe.
---
Oh nice i am jealous....my friend's wives dont let them play cause they have grown up.....pffff.Have fun guyyyyyyssssss
---
just for fun haHaa
---
These are the type of people that turned vanilla into retail, community beware.
---
Oh dont worry, I'll tell all the new people about the portal in the fire rune behind Golemagg ;)
---
Look up "First to Market".
---
Is it not possible to have the addon advance to the next step automatically? I used zygors back in the day and it had that function.
---
Seriously, grade A bait thread OP.
---
The "I'm actually a dev" comments are the cherry on top.
---
Keep it up.
---
Wasn't Hellfire Peninsula also planned for Vanilla very early on?
---
It's very different from retail tanking. In retail mobs will just stick to you for the most part. They severely buffed threat generation in retail over the years, making it very hard to lose any aggro.
---
Also warrior is THE main tank and it works a bit differently. You have no AoE ability. Thundeclap only hits 4 targets and doesn't do much damage (not much threat). You will be switching constantly between targets to apply sunder armor and heroic strike as these are you main skills to generate threat.
---
Also DD's should give the tank some time to generate threat. If they instantly go full dps and/or AoE it's gonna be hard to get aggro for you.
---
If the DD's play their part, it's not really hard to tank, it's just different from retail.
---
Same thing happened to me and I even did it at 5AM EST - just a few days ago. Either "name botting" is a real thing or it's a one in a million thing. I can't imagine someone just sitting there hitting the create button over and over.

Growl and the passive pet abilities are all taught to you by the trainer.
---
As for active skills (except Growl) you will have to learn them from other animals. Some animals will automatically have a specfic skill when you tame them, Strigid Hunter's in Teldrassil for example all come with Claw (Rank 2), when you have a pet with a specific spell and see them use the ability you will eventially learn the spell, giving you the ability to teach all you other pets^\(1\)
---
So for example, if you're leveling with an owl (which you should if you start night elf, they're pretty broken imo), by the time you hit westfall at level 16 or higher, you should stable your pet and look for a greater Fleshripper to tame, give it a bit of food and start using it's Screech ability to you learn it, once you've learned it and is back at a stable master you can freely abandon the Fleshripper and take your Owl back out, teach it Screech and congratulations, you now have an insane threat ability on your pet that makes it a lot tankier without sacrificing a lot of damage.
---
(1) Assuming the spell is valid for that school of pet, e.g. No Bite own Owls, no Dive on Cats etc.
---
Yeah, the very loyal will still stick with retail and buy that 1 store mount or any stupid micro-transaction that will make more money than every classic resub... 100k subs to retail would still make more money than classic
---
The people currently playing retail won't be on classic in a month so I highly doubt it will be a wasteland. BfA isn't being killed by classic, its funding classic.
---
I used to play disco priest when I played on current wow, but then I fell in love with druids. Not sure if I will love it as much in classic, so I will probably give priest a try
---
Dude she want him
---
very good point, fuck it rolling boomkin

I Just installed TeamViewer to my PC and phone. Hope this will ease my workday tomorrow.

It’s an application google twitch client download it and within it you can download addons for classic that will go straight into your install folder bud.
---
Is this some sort of filthy casual joke that I’m too much of a gaming warlord to understand?
---
I'm highly debating shaman now too.
---
Though I'm between Druid and Shaman now as my solo char and Priest to level duo, he will play warrior so a natural fit.

Mining, collect and put everything in the bank, you will need mats to level eng.

World first race alone breaks like 200k on the method main channel alone iirc, wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it broke 500k+.

Ok, what exactly would classic+ be?
---
\*\*&lt;Moderna Misstag&gt; \[EUPVP-Shazzrah\] Swedish Semi-Hardcore Raiding \[HORDE\]\*\*
---
\&amp;nbsp;
---
\*\*About Us\*\*
---
We are a group of friends that have been playing WoW since Vanilla Beta and day 1 on the EU launch back in 2005 and now we turn all of our attention towards WoW Classic and we want you to join us!
---
We want to establish a Swedish speaking guild that will be highly respected on our server and have a great community who realise that real life responsibilities comes first and gaming comes second but who still want to have a great time playing WoW Classic. We offer a mature and relaxed raiding environment where everyone feels welcome.
---
First and foremost we want to enjoy our time spent playing the game and if we ensure that we and all of our raiders have a great time playing together then raid progression will follow. Besides having fun the goal will always be to clear all raid content at a steady and reliable pace.
---
\*\*Raid Times\*\*
---
Wed/Sun: 19:30-22:30 CET
---
We plan on raiding twice a week for the initial phases and then likely add a third raid day as we progress into the later phases and additional raids are added.
---
\*\*Loot System\*\*
---
A DKP system will be used, exactly what version of decay/closed/open bid etc is not determined yet. Certain items will be separate from the DKP system, such as gearing up tanks but everything will be done with transparency and fairness in mind.
---
\*\*Expectations\*\*
---
Attitude, Attendance, Performance
---
To us player attitude and behaviour is the most important aspect of being a good guild member, both in dealing with other guild members but also with the rest of the servers community. Poor behaviour on your part will not only tarnish your own reputation but also the guilds reputation and we will not tolerate that. That being said as long as you treat people with a nice and respectable attitude we will not have a problem.
---
Besides having a good attitude we want you to have as good of a raid attendance as you can manage, but it is our job as a community to provide you with an enjoyable experience so that you want to log in and attend raids and perform to the best of your ability. It does not matter if you have previous raiding experience or if you are completely new to the game as long as you are a team player with the mindset that the guild itself will always be more important than any individual member.

probably the most retarded statement ever made
---
pendrives
---
Actually vanilla was catered to carebears and casuals. If you think Vanilla is bad, you should play some of the MMOs before it.
---
Imagine trying to relive your late twenties by making fun of what other people do for fun while playing a 15 year old game
---
I mean I don't mind waiting. There's still 10 1/2 hours until launch. It would just be nice to know if its going to go through at ALL. Some transaction history / removal of paypal money would be nice, so I know that something is happening.
---
The lead-up to Classic has been painful. But knowing it's out, and being unable to play so that I can quote people for toilets... heartbreaking. 
---
I plan on sleeping from 7pm-midnight tonight though, and playing from midnight until 4am.
---
Want to play Alliance, but all of my friends want to be Horde. So Orc Warrior it is.
---
Dont underestimate the competitive spirit going on WoW these days, and with logs being a thing you bet many ppl will go for these buffs
---
I got diabetes and coronary diseases just by looking at this picture. Please don't do this. You will fuck up your body
---
I spent quite a bit of time during vanilla just chatting and harvesting mats. Good times.
---
If the high level is staring me down Ill always do a /wave and then /bow. Then I backaway slowly and hide for a few minutes if they are still standing there.

 !remindmein 2 days
---
It's alright bud :) It's been a looooong time. Tomorrow we're going home!
---
Replace “you” with “I” when sharing your opinions and you will sound like less of an asshole.
---
Essentially every MMO ever launched has had website/server issues the day of. Transactions are difficult to process or are delayed, or sometimes won’t go through at all. Not to mention you used PayPal which can take days to process.
---
Case in point: if you don’t want to be stressed about the timing of activating a sub, don’t procrastinate until the last day. All you’re sacrificing is peace of mind.
---
Never ever
---
I planned to play without addOns but for this one I think I'll make an exception !
---
Thanks for your hard work :)
---
NA/EST/PVP or PVE
---
Dwarf paladin looking for a raiding guild. I could raid any day from 7:00 PM EST to 11:00EST. I have not decided on a server yet so I can go to any server. I will be somewhat slow at leveling due to my job but I am fine with being a backup raider until I can play more and be prepared. Can do any spec but I know I’ll be holy for raids.
---
Servers open 12am and Im home at 4am. Guess whos not sleeping for 30h straight :D
---
Yea that’s my problem I have 4 friends on horde 8 on alliance 😂
---
!remindme 2d
---
The print screen key is the default hotkey for the intake screenshot.
---
EU prime time will be a surge again I think, I'll probably try remotely logging in just before 5-6pm
---
Hey dude, thanks for your comment. I understand what you want to point out, but I didn’t put the link in the description, so only guys who are interested find it. My twitch channel is soooo small, almost at 0 viewers. I don’t want to have any profits from that stream. I just want to have fun and maybe have some viewers to interact with and get back home to classic together :)
---
Delete this point don't need more clogging up que times
---
WHAT THE FUCK????
---
Warrior it is then!

#[FUN DETECTED]
---
I feel like 15 years old again. Tommorow is party after work with colegues, and I was like: Nah, I am good. I am going home tommorow! Literally.
---
With a competent group and healing gear you should be fine. May have to take it slower but overall possible.
---
Love the MCP lmao
---
Thanks, setting my alarm!
---
I have read so, yep.
---
Guild member of mine calculated, If you do all the quest you will still need 400 stacks of runecloth for turn ins.
---
&gt; secondary PC.
---
Virtual machine.
---
Why would I waste electricity on running a secondary PC, if I can just make a virtual machine with 1 core and 4 gigs of RAM, give it like 50 gigs of disk space, install Windows and Classic there and just set up a tool that will click a single button forever? ;)
---
With modern 6+ core systems, you won't even notice it running.
---
omg thank you
---
Songflower will be in from day 1 don't even need to wait for that one
---
Also warlock can dot multiple enemies at a time and do lots of good damage whereas the feral bear can tank them. Warlock doesn’t need heals or mana really.
---
!remindme 1 day

Gonna main an undead mage, so excited.

I think it's super cute that you think you will see this any time this month.

Pop a flare and put down the thunder on those sneaky boys
---
If it isn’t showing on your PayPal history I would think it hasn’t gone through at all. If you’re willing to wait a few hours go for it. Your best bet might to try again. There are most likely thousands of people trying today, hope it sorts itself out for you dude!
---
i hope your joking

And I'll be waiting every minute of it!

---
Ugh this hurts. I have made so many friends in WoW over the years that I have lost to time.
---
 Well because the time frame. Blizzard is great, you are the culprit not thinking ahead. You gave yourself how much time, 12 hours to troubleshoot for an important day? Why wouldn't you subscribe earlier in the week to log in and test?
---
Need to take responsibility in life for kinda dumb decisions right.
---
Upvote, for old times sake
---
You'll make new friends :) Just like we did the first time
---
I actually just looked up songflower serenade. I’d farm those bitches for sure 😂😂😂
---
I knew two people in classic that had an untreatable disease. One was the Shaman leader for our MC group. Both died during Classic, a lot of people went to their funerals.
---
Cheers mates, we will raid MC again in honor of you.
---
Ah thanks, I assumed it would be temp full with a log in queue but wanted to make sure
---
? to the new servers they’re releasing today before classic release
---
We aren't so many interested in classic, and the spanish community is so divided probably you won't even notice us
---
No need to respec...  You can heal just fine with intellect gear. Especially if you get Heart of The Wild.
---
Do not go prot. Even for leveling you go Holy and use Consecrate or Ret.
---
Like the only things in Prot to get are:
---
* Imp. Devotion (for Holy)
---
* Precision (for Ret; Holy if you want)
---
* Blessing of Kings (for Holy)
---
* Guardian's Favor (for Holy)
---
* Imp. Concentration Aura (for Holy; marginal..you shouldn't be getting hit in dungeons/raids)
---
Now...you can make an "lawl" build that uses Reckoning and Seal of Command for some funny moments. But it's not optimal
---
Like I'll be going:
---
* Holy:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05553000521151-503201-052](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05553000521151-503201-052) 
---
* Ret:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/55-503-55230351000315](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/55-503-55230351000315) 
---
Shame too, because really the only thing Paladins were missing back in Vanilla was sustain for mana and a taunt. Literally could have fixed the specc by replacing Imp. Righteous Fury with a taunt and making Blessing of Sanctuary return mana on blocks (think that changed in TBC).
---
For some weird reason I didn’t know you can type lower case in mail.
---
Jokes on you forgetting about the possible hours of login queue.
---
This is true, I was the plain letter
---
lmao imagine being this much of a fanboy  
---
what a schizo
---
Level a rogue to 15 then get a buddy to run you through the low dungeons to gear a super Twink 19 rogue for wsg stomps
---
True VM makes more sense
---
Judging by your comment, people from private servers will apparently have a superiority complex as well. 
---
Like seriously, I thought the "retail players are gonna suck" thing was getting old but now we are at the point where actually having played the game back in the day is not enough either? That's just dumb.
---
the site the OP linked is the same I used to grab all my addons.    
---
willitclassic.com
---
It's like some of you guys *want* dierrhea.
---
As I already said. We just wanna have fun at our lan-party and maybe one or two people will join us and say hello. I don’t think, that i stuffed my link under everyone’s nose.
---
Have fun with classic wow dude :)
---
I'm going STRAIGHT for the T0 dungeon armor set, then i will begin my never-ending qurst for a sloe rpic twohander. (Shammy)

I need that for my owl pet!
---
Ill be listening to the in game sounds and music. Because I want to immerse myself in the world. Otherwise it does indeed just become a grind and nothing more

Hmm good point.

It should say processing

Might do one of those next, just to show some support.

&gt;PSA: You can play Classic WoW casually

Yes, but I won't
---
|Alliance|Pagle|Tues/Wed/Thurs 9-12PM-midnight|Serious/RL-cognisant|Loot undecided but to consider attendance and performance|
---
Hello and thanks for reading!
---
We are Spite, and we’re in full recruitment mode to prepare for Classic! We are a combination group of chill RL friends, WoW buddies who have raided retail together since Vanilla, met in Legion or BfA for AotC raiding, and new acquaintances from private classic server groups. We are coming together for a chance at Classic raiding nostalgia and a “second chance” to play Vanilla now that we are 15 years better for it! We are an easy-going group of adults who aren’t afraid to swear or laugh at ourselves (or you :D) but we are serious about setting time away from the real world to progress efficiently in Classic, see old content again, and just genuinely enjoy ourselves. We plan to be a serious (neither hardcore nor casual) raiding group, likely raiding progression two nights of Tues-Thurs 9-12 (PM-midnight) EST (with guild input considered), and off-progression weekend raids. We won’t be screaming in discord, but we will expect execution and willingness to take advice and improve. We are considering options on loot systems, but we intend to incorporate one of/a combination of loot council and suicide kings lists. Ultimately the guild will decide together on final loot system. Our bottom line loot goal is to keep everybody happy; while reflectively rewarding attendance first, and performance second above all else. As BGs become available, we have several members interested in PvP nights too. We are a community who will definitely be online every night, and regularly on discord for general community engagement on off-nights and before/after raids.
---
Come join us in this fresh reset of where it all began! We are accepting all recruits regardless of WoW experience--we all had to start somewhere! We are more interested in building a tight-knit community that grows and progresses together than we are interested in min-maxing every single raid spot and all other high-drama incidents. Performance and desired roles will eventually be considered for progression nights. Experienced raiders will be considered for higher-responsibility roles as the guild takes shape.
---
You can add me Ranatheii#1152 or Brom in-game, for an invitation or with questions. Happy classic!
---
Cheers, -Brom
---
I played retail up to level 5 and called it quits. It was so boring. Started off as an Orc Warlock and all I did was spam shadowbolt into a fuckin pen that is holding all the boars. Was it to difficult for people when the boars roamed free? I never went below 95% mana either. Just sucks what has happened to it.
---
Why would they do either of those dungeons? There is a ton of gear from live/ud strath and lbrs/brd. And they can farm them much more efficiently. Isn't it weird to advise them to do the slowest dungeons to level lol
---
As long as it was not deliberate, it is just a misunderstanding caused by youtube being weird. All good.
---
200iq
---
i dumped bfa almost right after it came out
---
Same for me. I missed the first 2 weeks of patch 8.2 and when I logged I had so many things to do between leveling the follower and doing campaign (for the Tauren heritage armor quest), grinding rep at nazjatar and mechagon, and all the dailies and WQ that I started playing overwatch while I wait for classic
---
beautiful
---
same here \^\^
---
Haha dude you are killing it! I went out and got a ton of over ready food and snacks and drinks. Some sushi and pizza nights and oh man I'm excited. Fun to be a grown up playing haha
---
Yes you can.
---
Thats exactly what it means? Just curious
---
Me in queue: "I´m doing my part"
---
look up Lord of the Rings online, no loading screens in Middle Earth until Moria (you level from 1-50 until you get there) you can spend hours running/riding a horse before you get to the first loading screen.
---
I feel like that 15%+ chance isn't properly factoring in the different risk factors.  Assuming he is/was a younger guy in the USA (or another developed country) of reasonably good health, I'm pretty sure his chances for dying within 15 years are lower than that.
---
Play what you want. You don't need a main to lvl a warrior was the first thing I got to 60 when I was a nub in vanilla not that hard.
---
Yep, same for us. I set up discord for all of us irl friends who played back in the day. The boys are back in town for classic.
---
I’ll probably just put on a live Lo fi stream from YouTube.
---
https://youtu.be/w3TVkxaJ5Y8
---
The only song you need.
---
Last time I tried to quit the first few days I actually had horrible rage-fueled nightmares, and i would literally stand up swinging in the air like some nicotine fiending manchurian candidate.
---
F for this man showing up a minute late. Que will be in the 20k range
---
Unfortunately I can’t, and it’s 6 hours long. Gonna be a solid 12 hours late for launch :(
---
It should be possible with a good group and perhaps some points in the Resto tree.
---
Now that I think about it, it might actually be a good idea to put a handful of points in Resto for leveling Feral anyway.
---
Not that you have much of a choice anyway. Respec’ing is an extremely expensive thing to do in classic and if you want to be able to afford a mount you likely won’t be able to respec more than once or twice.

Do you know any equipment that will give you a .3% hit increase?

All I've found have been either a flat +1, +2 or +3.

OOh I cant wait for Vanilla Battle for Azeroth.
---
silverpine itself isn't that great of a level zone but it might only be worth it because the barrens funnels all the horde into one area and it's going to be super camped.

ohh boy, you guys are gonna get eaten alive

l have had multiple kids in this sub telling me that stalagg will be a dead server and laughing at me for rolling it and not herod or faerlina. There are some dumbasses out here..
---
Wasn't this posted earlier today?
---
It has spear potential!
---
Agree to disagree
---
Only good thing about BFA was that I made 2 million gold fish botting at the start of the expansion. That got me enough tokens for 2 years of classic!
---
I can understand choice problems with classes, but factions? Thats not a choice, it's a way of life! Lok'tar Ogar!
---
there was TONS of wpvp in bc ***lmfao.***
---
how do i sort the app versions for classic version on twitch app
---
What the fuck is Sydney to Perth time? There are 2 hours difference between Sydney and Perth bro. Are you in Perth or Sydney? Because if you're in Perth you're good. However if you're in Sydney you can't play til 8am.
---
Full Throttle is Casual / Social / PVE guild. And we are Russian.
---
Don’t need two sets of gear until 60 at which point that will give you something to do. I would do whichever you have more fun with as the two sets of gear is rather minor
---
I'm from Hydraxian Waterlords.
---
Praying for short/no queues!
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
It's fine but you will probably have to choose pvp vs pve if tanking raids. 
---
Dps would be fine for both but fury is king in pve and arms for pvp. Prot runner for WSG with pocket heals is also great with boss pve def gear.
---
It's the constant respec for activities that will kill the bank.
---
I literally searched for "where is brazil meme" in google and I found it
---
Is there any way I can immediately get blizzard currency? I have paypal + debit. If not then maybe I just have to wait it out.
---
Huh?
---
While Warrior isn't the best solo/farming class, it's by no means bad either.  It's just very gear dependent but it can still work.
---
Patchwerk 16th? Last in, first out.
---
Feels weird to actaully be looking at a real screenshot of a conversation.
---
Puts into perspective how 98% of screenshots on IG and FB are fake haha
---
Realy great job OP! I'm actually doing this tonight before launch!
---
Imagine not having queues in the 10s of thousands...
---
You missunderstood, there will be new servers opening today before the launch :) ty for the reply tho
---
I couldn’t agree more with this. I just don’t understand the argument, if we do expacs it brings us straight back to retail. I loved TBC and Wrath, but there’s no way Blizzard would just stop all the sudden after wrath. Doesn’t make sense
---
BDO was seamless from what I remember and nice looking shame the draw distance was/is arse.
---
&gt; arenas are the major reason behind the homogenization of the classes 
---
LMFAO no.  LAZINESS is the reason.
---
I was such a noob I ran out of gold on my hunter and couldn’t afford repairs so I had to beg my paladin friend for gold lol. So ya play smart and you’ll be fine on any class
---
Nope
---
No way E scooters should be legal On the road

im in Perth so 6am for me.

You're about four days too late.  Got my hopes up they were adding even more.
---
I wish. That would make the next 10 hours way easier.
---
Not even a little bit
---
*said no one ever*
---
Or a rich doctor with a family that takes up most of his free time, but he is happy.
---
Exactly! I stopped playing retail because as 'casual' as Blizz tried to make it, if you stop playing for as little as 2-3 days you're all of a sudden 15 item levels behind the masses and can no longer get in groups. With Classic, I'm happy to take my time knowing end game isn't going anywhere, and I'll get there when I get there
---
Hey, thanks for the reply. Can I ask you to give me a source?
---
Greetings fellow grob mobber.
---
Problem with that spec is that for most of your levelling you won’t have most of it :p You listed 51 points which is lvl 60. Going deep into one tree is almost always better and BM is a solid choice for both PvE and PvP because you’re very gear independent. In short, your pet will be really strong and fuck ppl over, especially with Intimidation and Bestial Wrath.
---
Cap-tan
---
yeah that's crazy... like 500ish gold
---
Well this is old news
---
Nope, still want to play.
---
This screams murica so much you fat fuck
---
Absolutely hyped mate. Haven't been able to play a game for 2 weeks without giving up in a few minutes, nothing compares. 
---
Prepare to die in STV, Alliance scum! 
---
Maybe I'll face you one day if you're on Arugal
---
"The drums of war thunder once again."
---
Arms was better anyway for a fair while. In both pve and pvp. /hide
---
Over 600k. Besides method, asmon, soda and generally wow streamers, we are also getting almost every gaming streamer in the world logging in to try it. Tim, ninja and others will stream classic.
---
Out of boredom I played retail, ended up making several level 20 f2p ‘twinks’. 
---
Pvp is reasonably fun that way against other twinks, but it feels weird still. 
---
Mana is basically not an issue and healers can only be killed if they are heavily nuked and interrupted correctly
---
Indeed. Release is at midnight for me. Luckily I am free this whole week so it's all good.
---
Whoever commented, you are banned.
---
TIL my yahoo email makes me old.
---
Yup, once it's launched the subreddit will get larger and we'll turn into r/wow. Gone will be the days of discussion, incoming are low effort memes and drawings.
---
computers? how DO they work?
---
but you want to install both winzip and winrar (shareware versions, of course)
---
So... you met in a prison.
---
You can play with Gametime
---
BFA was the first expansion i didn't bother buying, played since vanilla.
---
Drill a few inches to the left and you’ll be off work!
---
Well with the new patch you literally were if you didn’t do them
---
thank you for all the answers.    
---
i get it, it sems BM is not bad everywhere, but it's just my pet who does all the things :-D   
---
i think it's more fun, if i snipe or kite enemies in the wild.   
---
i will think about it the last remaining hours.   
---
thanks!

Oh my god Petopia that's a blast from the past.  I levelled a hunter alt and it was such a handy go-to guide.

add bout 12 hours to that for login queue...lol
---
This video should be on top of reddit.
---
Great work Platinum :)
---
Why do you think I'm asking when the new servers open? All non - RP servers in Eu are High/Full.
---
Why did you call it Sydney to Perth time lol... Literally a 2 hour difference. Do you know how big our country is bro? Lol
---
How is that ü pronounced?
---
Your wrong about so much. Yes you avoid the low level mobs.... Your just talking yourself in circles because you weirdly can't wrap your head around how vanilla has changed in 15 years.
---
&gt;  I have seen some posts saying that a card is not equal to a subscription, therefore i cant play classic if i activate the gametime with the card 
---
Whoever said this is full of crap.  A game time card will suffice.  Classis does not require anything but an active account.
---
I lost my hair in the last 15 years so my Paladin will be bald :D
---
How old do you think boomers are?
---
With many retail players coming back it's not weird that some might be confused, there the game starts at max level, everything up to that point is just as boring as possible so you buy a level boost instead.
---
I haven't ever been this legitimately excited for anything ever. This is the best feeling.
---
Echo isles in the bottom right isn't the troll starting zone until cataclysm
---
Welp, idk man just go on a high server is the most you can do atm
---
i see what u mean, like a god tier item, like the scarab lord mount?   
---
And its a great theme i think, not sure how the equip text would convert over into wow tho, maybe "all auto attacks miss but abilities always crit"
---
Not really. I'm assuming you haven't played Vanilla in 14 years? It's not as hard as you remember. Certainly not when it comes to healing dungeons lol.
---
Because thats what this game should be! A character that is just one of the common folks! Not a "champion" or "hero of azeroth" but instead of being a semi god, we become powerfull when we unite with the other common travelers, who have mastered different fighting styles in their journeys.
---
That way the world feels alot more alive, since every mob is a life threatening opponent.
---
Good items needs to be earned! There is real depth in the talent trees, rare rewards really feel like its rare and cool.
---
So glad this is finally happening! (:

Do you like Pain "POO" koladas?
---
This is the problem right here, blizzard refusing to say how many people there actually are when it says "medium" or "full"
---
They said they'll stick to phases so I dont see them reverting this, but !
---
I do hope they bring variations back to hunter pets if classic has new patches,  balanced ones ofcourse.
---
TYVM for the sourced answer, now I know how long I can sleep lmfao.
---
apparently pickpocketing sucks in classic now.. not valuable enough. Anyway having to be specd into subtlety is a big  problem too.
---
how do u deal with vendoring in Swamp of sorrows? looting everything on beasts and herbs gonna fill up ur not so great bags quickly
---
And I’m telling you most of us were absolutely awful back then at this game. We had legit no fucking clue what we were doing half the time. And many of us were young. We did absolutely fine. We did it as pugs and used awful sub optimal specs. 
---
I didn’t even know what stats I was supposed to be gearing on my druid until well after we killed nefarion. I just knew that stormrage gear looked like a sexy ass moose and the big green dragon guarding the portal dropped me a staff that looked like an ear of corn and I love fucking corn. So I went with that.
---
No you couldn’t, this is a pserver phenomenon
---
I meal prepped chicken breast and vegetables personally
---
Lbrs is probably one of the hardest dungeons in classic.
---
No one thought otherwise
---
Omg, so lame from my side :( Alliance player here
---
Mmm sets pieces didn't drop in Wrath.. You got a token which you could trade in for the piece you wanted...
---
   What if you remake and delete characters? Still 30 mins?
---
I love that you're angry about a change you're not even sure exists yet.
---
you have to screenshot your attunement before they let you order it
---
Probably the same stupid way people are proud of showing they are eating healthy.
---
No one should care what you eat, just do it in moderation and have a great time enjoying them game!
---
Are pillagers the fuckers that net you and uses backstab?
---
Never played WoW before but returning to oldschoolrunescape was so much fun that I'm psyched to start playing classic now.
---
No friends that play though so if anyone is looking for a noob undead mage to chat with HMU.
---
They are terrible terms to compare as world of warcraft classic is still world of warcraft. So a lot of people searching for classic are still going to be searching "world of warcraft". A better comparison would be wow classic compared to wow bfa.
---
Yes, but without the option to buy a level boost... You'd obviously start at lvl 1.
---
I'm not sure what is so hard about understanding that pugs vary in skill levels, and your own personal experience is not the only possible outcome.
---
Did you even think about healthy meal prepping? You’re going to get cheese on your keyboard!
---
Hm, it’s similar to the „u“ in further. Not exactly but almost :)
---
Good, you deserve to be banned!  However, they should ban you from all games, not just Classic.
---
Less than vendor price depending on what rank they make
---
This is 4d chess.  Tell them u can start in 2 weeks because u need to give notice.  Then don't give notice.  Bam, grind to 60.
---
My dad works at Sega he said he will shut you down in a matter of second!!
---
&gt; ready to share quests, ready to show secrets
---
Are there any limitations on quest sharing in Classic? I assume that you can only share quests if you currently have the quest and have not turned it in?

Looking for a good guild that will be fun to just hang out with during leveling and chilling.

Tuna is healthy for you, even when eaten every day. Mercury poisoning has been overhyped, and other sources of protein also have cons to them. This sub has incredibly bad health advice, on some posts you see people posting a pack of Mountain Dew and autists screeching "diabetes".  Guys, if you can't digest couple thousand calories of carbs then you have worse problems to consider than soda in your diet.

\#1: Fish is good for you. Research has shown that  it may lower your risk of heart disease death, says Dariush Mozaffarian,  M.D., Dr.P.H., dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and  Policy at Tufts University. Emerging but not-yet-established evidence  suggests that eating fish may also help combat stroke, obesity,  cognitive decline, depression, cancer, inflammatory disorders, and  asthma. Restricting your fish intake could make you miss out on all  those benefits. 
---
\#2: The risks from mercury have been overhyped. Mercury *can*  harm the developing nervous systems of fetuses and young children,  according to the FDA. But when the agency warned pregnant women to limit  consumption of high-mercury fish in 2004, it set off unnecessary panic  for everyone else, Dr. Mozaffarian says.

Ill login a few hours prior to see if a queue might be in early or something, if not ill try like every half hour again, if therers a queue im going to try timing it so i can enter character selection within the 30minute window of it kicking you out and the release.
---
Even retail x-packs you don't get free max lvl or paid max lvl. Nearly yes but not fully.
---
So first I was like OP didnt post the source. 
---
Then I was like oh damn OP is the source. Didnt know you were on Reddit MonoriRogue. Love you work!

except that chicken and pasta will get old quick, and the greens you have in there will wilt...pretty amateur move tbh packing all it together
---
all horde players seem like they’re stuck in their emo phase and vape in the school bathroom at lunch time.
---
each layer will still have a ton of people playing on it
---
Hahaha
---
Agreed
---
For the first few months at least.
---
There’s a really decent chance you’ll still be in queue. If you somehow get to character select, you’ve beaten the queue.
---
Progressive itemization is not a thing in classic. We get the final versions of obtainable items from the get-go. That means no pvp gear changes, we can start obtaining the 1.12 versions in phase 2.
---
I am literally travelling back in time right now. Classic WoW, Downfall memes, now I just need a new Epic Rap Battle of History
---
Especially maces
---
Warlock class fantasy interests me even less than mage tbh and as an Alliance player I'd have to deal with WotF too. The only other thing I'm considering is spriest but it seems like you'll generally get stuck with preraid gear.
---
No matter what you do, if you stay in character section screen more then 30 minutes, it will kick you out.
---
How much should a preist charge to give you a stam buff, or a shaman give you water breathing. If you are out in the world and someone asks politely and you try to charge you are a dick. Id just make a bunch open trade and give people i saw some without even being asked.
---
Yes we can, Blizzard said there will be an Update before Launch, but apparently that Update happened yesterday.
---
No. What you're saying is full of shit lol.
---
What makes you think classic+ wouldn't turn into retail?
---
Most of the time canned tomatoes are peeled and in their juices. Stuff's great for stews and shit.
---
Do you care about min/max? If not got Nelf
---
Yes, very noticeable. I personally got lucky that Forsaken are great for PvP rogues.
---
Don’t worry, I will be playing on a laptop.
---
I don’t think so, I know that I’ve spent way too long creating toons and naming them at times and gotten kicked back to login. And I was definitely typing and clicking
---
Honestly, no. If you are going to play super hardcore min/max than the sword skill might make a difference. Otherwise you should just play what you are comfortable with. You’re going to invest hundreds of hours into this character. May as well play one you like!

Horde of Paragon: [H][US] Daggerspine --&gt; [H] Stalagg
---
We've had plenty of time to get our lives, careers, and families back on track. It's high time we neglected all of those again and get back to failing at WoW. The Horde of Paragon, formerly [H][US]Daggerspine, is looking for old members and friends lost to time.
---
We're old. We all have real jobs now. Our kids are in therapy because we neglected them while raiding. Our spouses are happy we're not playing (but tbh they spend more time on InstaGram and Pintrest than I ever did on WoW... so there.). But let's ignore all that and spend some time together again.
---
This sub is so shit now
---
I'd like you to be more clear about what's "world pvp" for you.
---
Because if by "world pvp" you mean a 1v1 over  a thorium node, that existed in TBC too.
---
Ah.
---
&gt; What was popular in your area (2005)
---
The idea that there are only two genders.
---
__________
---
Then, and get this, I say
---
&gt; Oh you said differences, nvrm
---
Because in 2019 there is still only 2 genders, so in fact it's not a difference.
---
Same as looking at Super Bowl / Thanksgiving spreads... it’s just apart of the event. I love it!
---
Ok real talk so you know what glancing blows are
---
Never seen OVERRATED written like that.
---
Thats actually hilarious :P
---
First Retribution Rouge I have seen for sure

Humans generate more rage cause of their increased weaponskill. And thats a very important thing in Vanilla. So I’d say yes, it is noticeable

I'm in college right now and have a very busy semester starting today. I'm thankful that I can just enjoy classic at my own pace. I don't need to log in to do daily reputation grind bullshit or daily Mythics or anything like that. I can just log in, explore the world, do some quests, gank some hordies, and log off without worrying about any huge commitments. I'm so excited.
---
Join us
---
Yeah.half the server is going to be roguez...then mages then priests....then all the other classes
---
Mage, lock, hunter.
---
All great at soloing in pve and pvp, all pretty fun to play in dungeons too. 
---
Mage being probably the best for dungeons but the worst at solo pve and hunter being the best at solo pve but probably the worst when it comes to the overall dungeon experience. Also Hunter can solo dungeons for loot at max level which can be fun too.
---
Is that right face actually a thing? looks kinda badass.
---
That looks like a pretty solid starting point for launch.
---
Yeah it must be.  I take masters courses and work a full time job that pays for those courses.  I'm playing all night tonight and took the day off tomorrow.
---
Ok you actually need to fuck off. I hope you get permabanned from this sub you leech.
---
Shazzrah was "Full" first, so I imagine it to be more crowded than Golemagg.
---
I don't get it.  Classic is launching tonight no?
---
That’s clearly cheddar
---
Legion was also brutal because the public quest system just feels like a mobile game. You log in and there's like 6 dailies to do in every zone. Felt so much like a chore. I know dailies have been relevant since TBC, but in Legion it really crushed me.
---
You are most welcome, and you can return the favor if you know of any obscure tools. I'm working on a follow-up if there are enough websites. Cheers!
---
Your logic is flawed. And very much so. Looking at the fact that High pop on a server means loads more players than 2005 and the majority are, without a shred of a doubt people in their 30s WITH jobs and responsibilities, the odds dictate that the "cough" hardcore crowd is way, waaaay below in percentage.

---
1) no race or appearance change. Choose wisely.
---
2) there is a lot of debate. Skinning will give you some free vendor stuff on most mobs you kill, which I've heard argued. But leveling your professions early while raw materials are cheap is my plan.
---
3) It does not. It just makes people want to be friends with you.
---
4) not really? PvP gear tends to have additional stamina which pvpers want, but there are obviously some raid items that are excellent for PvP.
---
5) you pay everytime you switch. It starts off at like 1g, then 5g, then 10, 15, 25, 50. And stays capped at 50g. Every month that price drops down 5g or something like that.
---
6) no arena. There is the arena in STV which is a small free for all fighting pit, but no organized arena as you're thinking of it.
---
7) I can't comment.
---
8) experience and the eternal essence of your inner rogue, is the best timer ;)

**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game raiding content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a consistent progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
While we don't expect everyone to no-life to level 60, we do plan on holding ourselves to a respectable standard when raiding.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate. 
---
Our raid times are tentative, but this is our current plan: 
---
Running 20-man raids on Tuesdays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
Running 40-man raids on Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT and Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;World PvP&gt;** Many of us are interested in running some pre-made BG's when they are introduced, though that isn't the primary focus of our core members. We will look to setup nights for coordinated world PvP. We have time until BG's are ready, so let's terrorize some Alliance scum and have some fun!
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all people who are passionate about what they play. Our current roster is available here: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing
---
Tank Demand: Low
---
Healer Demand: Medium
---
DPS Demand: Low

Oh didn't know :o

Nice.

Lok’tar Ogar
---
And curries.
---
This right here. It blows my mind how people think redbull and hotpockets is still the meta. Get with the times people
---
He said it reduces miss by .03% and does nothing for the glancing penalty by going from 308 to 311. Both of those statements are accurate. 
---
Based on this, OP's argument is that another point in weapon expertise is "useless." This isn't exactly true, as he already stated the .3% chance to miss reduction. What he doesn't mention is the .3% reduction to dodge, and possible parry as well. 
---
Nonetheless it does bring into question the value of the weapon expertise talents for rogues.
---
How you set wow icon??
---
&gt; your own personal experience is not the only possible outcome
---
funny, how it's coming from the one guy talking against the opinion of hundreds. Maybe you should take your own advice and accept that it might be possible to heal while leveling with every spec.
---
I'm also somewhat curious what you are going to play. As to my experience the ones with the most strict opinions to healing do not play a healer, ever.
---
It’s not about it being hard or easy. It’s just a bad system. I would love if we had a way to post groups in game like the LFG tool built into FFXI. 
---
Everyone is so twisted on LFG in wow because blizzard took it way too far and dumbed down all of the content which made the entire game barely require a pulse.
---
You and u/Kindalur should start your own group. The crabby old women of WoW classic.
---
BTW, I will be sending you a picture of my fridge when I get home. You will look at it and enjoy it, bitch.
---
Which will be around barely revered, if even that. Darnassus is a hard rep to get, there aren't many quests for it and the pserver values used by the guide you are referring to are more than twice as high than the real ones.
---
Lok'tar ogar friend
---
A snack named Shapes? That’s hilariously unimaginative!
---
that worked!!
---
I'm sad I'll stop reading this sub from tonight. This picture is gonna make great memes.
---
yawn
---
I feel like the meme was too long. After 20 seconds I was more interested in watching the movie scene than reading the text lol.
---
Nobody knows, because nobody can play yet. Character creation and the reddit polls are reliable
---
I'm going to kill the mobs. All of the mobs I see. I'll try to quest. I dunno how that'll work out. Then when I hit level 13 I'll suffer through RFC, the greatest vanilla instance in terms of loot drops (some bosses drop it)
---
People call the current WoW 'retail' to differentiate from Classic which is coming out tonight.
---
This is amazing.
---
Can't do quests as a raid.
---
Clearly passion fruit. Just look at how much passion the devs have put in.
---
Already have one lol!
---
No one knows except Blizzard :)
---
1. You definitely can't change your race, pretty sure you can't change appearance either.
---
2. At least take a gathering profession while you're levelling (skinning, herbalism, mining). No need to wait to 60 for a main profession tbh.
---
3. Enchanting allows you to enchant your own items but your enchants aren't any better than someone elses.
---
4. Raid gear is mostly better, unless you're hitting high rank 11-14 gear. I'm not 100% sure on this but I'm sure someone will correct me.
---
5. You have to pay gold for every respec and it gets more expensive the more you do it. And it's expensive to start with! Respec as little as possible.
---
6. No
---
7. Depends what you're looking for, there are so many out there, just do some googling and you'll find what you need. DeadlyBossMods, Recount and threat meter are all great though.
---
8. [Some suggestions here](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-guide-to-rogues-best-addons-and-macros).
---
Well then...
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I tend to stay away from any official forums as they usually attract the worst types of people. Server forums back in the day used to fun though for the banter so I may take a look.
---
How would you go about posting there if you don't have any retail characters I wonder. As the forum accounts name and avatar are linked to the armoury. I believe theh said classic wouldn't be getting the armoury.
---
Orc master race
---
Fuck that. If I see a little bitch ally priest /wave at me, I know EXACTLY who to camp.
---
Tanking was much harder and jankier in vanillla
---
How do you get it? I'm going to be rolling a Troll horde priest, where are there humanoids to even farm for cloth...
---
Wow actual quality/unique artwork and not big titty Sylvanas
---
TBC is better than vanilla in every way. Class design, the leveling experience, and the end game progression. The only thing that hurt tbc was flying.  Tbc is essentially classic+.
---
This is the new meta right here. God that looks delicious
---
Yeah like runescape classic where at the time any max skills were very very uncommon even though the game had been out 3 years.
---
&gt; BfA isn't being killed by classic, its funding classic.
---
Considering that Blizzard have used the most economical approach to create Classic, I'm pretty confident Classic is going to fund itself (and repay its initial development costs) pretty fast.
---
Everyone needs to take a few hour nap this afternoon to stay up a little later
---
The yellow one is, hands down.
---
You going for server first or racing Raids asap as they launch, no than no.
---
Yes, but your questions stem from a person concerned with retail wow, and moving those concerns over to classic.
---
Retail is about leveling, and raiding, and gear, and all the stuff. 
---
Classic is about relaxing with your friends and having a good time
---
There is no right or wrong way to play it.
---
anyone know what time servers are live in CET time?
---
At least 10+ people
---
Work went quite fast today actually. 1.5 hours left, gon' go straight to bed and sleep until 1am. Just think about the stuff you'll do and research various guides, tips and addons whenever you're free. It won't be as hard.
---
At 11:39 tonight I'll have been playing for almost 6 hours.
---
Deserved
---
Kekekek
---
did leeroy happen during vanilla? if so, we are really going back to an epic period in wow history.
---
I agree, I loved it but not everyone wants to see a guy with half an arm when they're having their breakfast today.
---
😂
---
You will have to wait for players to post census from their addon
---
&gt;It was awkward
---
It was so great - my adrenaline shot through the roof every crocolisk i encountered :D
---
Excuse me, I run on willpower alone
---
People on my server are completely trashing Classic. I can't tell if it's just trolling and bandwagoning but the conversation is always something like "classic is going to fail" and "no one is going to play" and "it was never fun"
---
I don't get it.
---
Wrong thot bot was part of everyone vanilla experience. The in game addons are over the line but there is no shame in tabbing out to see where you need to go if you get lost.
---
I think you overestimate how often (and how many) people are actively RPing in an RP server at a given time. But your choice in the end! :D
---
The tryhard no life speedruning jobless players are minority, and they are concentrated on reddit, which represents only a small part of players who will play WoW classic. Most of people have liabilities and jobs who will play classic, so you bet, a lot of them will play the fucking way they want.
---
I hope they bring back TBC in classic form. It was the peak for raiding.
---
NA
---
Stupid name gg.
---
Du skal nok ned efter mælk på et tidspunkt, medmindre du udelukkende bruger det til kaffen.
---
Just use a private server nothing wrong with that
---
You joke, but there was a teacher in my middle school who was put on a medical leave for his sleep deprivation from playing too much wow.
---
Picking flowers
---
Yeah. I mean, some solo runs I literally only use mend pet and autoshot. Come on guys we need the stats.
---
Thats dedication son.
---
Unpopular opinion: Karma is a bitch.
---
Zygor's guide (addon) works perfectly.
---
The real question is if he just spent some extra time helping his guildmate would it have thrown the timeline off enough to where there was never a crash?
---
Like the amount of licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop, the world may never know.
---
but actually it's "where is ukraine meme"
---
That's one big Ewok!
---
Wouldn’t it be easier just to screenshot?
---
We barely have streamers here in EU. Not to the same extent that the US will have anyway.
---
We should be thanking Nostalrius. Without them, none of this would be happening.
---
One less in the queue.  Bye Felicia!
---
drunk reporting for duty.
---
It only brings it into question if you haven't looked at the rogue talent tree and haven't seen a rogue damage breakdown.
---
You're basically looking at these 2 alternatives:
---
* 5% evis damage
---
* 4% poison damage
---
Neither of which will really add anything significant to your damage (especially not the poison as horde)
---
&gt; names rhymes with Macrosoft 
---
It *rhymes* with macrosoft??
---
What monitor stand/mount is that. I have been looking for something for a while
---
I have no idea. Positivity isn't meme-able or they just don't understand the power of hardstyle. Yo the new Qlimax looks sick btw.

Speaking of Ruins of Lordaeron, if you turn up your ambient and kill all other sound in the throne room, you can hear Arthas' and his father's final dialogue (from WC3).

Oh I didn't know that we only had 3 pet slots. First time I played WoW was in Wotlk.
---
So weird hmmm but anyway, the wait is almost over, see you in Azeroth!!
---
Or ya know... he goes back in time.
---
It's one of my favorite videos from classic wow :D
---
I love the scene where you see it from a horde's perspective. Suddenly you get murdered by a rogue wearing a giant 2hander, and then he vanish
---
Old news
---
Rogue on a pvp server is the most fun thing tbh. Going priest this time around but for sure leveling a rogue alt.
---
Lol, more like Diablo 2 remade on the Diablo 3 engine.
---
I think whit shazz or golemag you chose automaticly the biggest pop server \^\^

the pole was from redit, idk if this was the "latest" one. but here you see a RAWR data, not accurate but mb it helps you

You're taking this way too personally man, if its not your brand of comedy consider this your cue to chill out and leave it for those who may enjoy it. You don't need to respond to every comment on the internet.
---
Care to continue or argue? Shame, as I won't grant you audience. Lighten up.
---
YOu can still go in the server but today there will come out 4 more servers \^\^ 
---
personally i will prob take Mograine
---
Oh dear, so much wrong here.
---
* 4 days 20 hours is ancient record, of course it will be beaten. Those dungeon cleave groups are calculating with 60-80 hours played to reach 60. So 4-5 days with a good amount of rest in between.
---
* Onyxia and molten core attunement, is there any reason to not do the attunement during the leveling process? You will run brd and lbrs before you are 60. Only the single ubrs run is something you do on 60.
---
* 5400 mobs needed for hydraxian rep, what? neutral to honored is 9k rep, at 5 rep per kill, that's 1800 total. You just tripled the rep requirement. Not to mention, you also get rep from the quests and mc mobs. In reality, you need perhaps 1000 silithus mobs.
---
* Neither ubrs nor lbrs have any lockout.
---
* Yeah, in vanilla Ragnaros lived 154 days. But if you don't see a difference between playing a completely new game, where nobody had any idea how it works and what's optimal compared to playing the same game 15 years later after it has been dissected meticously over many iterations of private server, I don't know what to say.
---
Too many people think the amount of viewers on twitch directly correlates to the health of the game? "Oh it's only the 10th most viewed game on twitch right now? Behind the just chatting category? Dead game!"
---
I can't be addicted to Wow Classic AND diablo 2 remake at the same time, not eough time in the universe to make that happen!
---
And I can't even get my charger until Phase 2!
---
more servers 5hrs before launch
---
Hahaha I was actually super embarrased making this purchase at the cashier. Frozen goods usually isn't my thing..
---
Warriors, priests and mages have dominated every poll I’ve seen and then rogues are after all of them. It would seem this running joke isn’t true anymore.
---
Unfortunately, this is probably what's gonna end up happening.
---
It was me but your map is better :D
---
It's wow ffs!!!
---
I want one!!
---
You just gotta open your eyes and confront the fact that these people are going to be your closest friends from this day forward
---
EU-Alliance-PvP - Realm: TBD
---
First timer on vanilla, played wotlk and retail casually before. Interested in seeing the charm of vanilla and having partners to level up and experience the whole thing with. Safe to say I'm gonna start up pretty casual but who knows what the future holds.
---
Zug zug.
---
Do you have an example slot for which there is no item?
---
50%, take it or leave it.
---
Better how? It would certainly increase queus by a lot.
---
beween 305 and 308 its even more min maxing then anything else \^\^   
---
But hey, if ppl wanna go that far why not :)  on private server this was maybe the case but everything above 305 is just wasted points, you are better off whit gloves + crit or Attackpower
---
Why? Its a normal question to ask where are they gonna take this game
---
Personally I think you're better off running through wetlands and picking up the Thelsamar flightpath because you get discovery XP, it takes a while to swim out to the spot where you're supposed to drown, and you spirit rez in Kharanos which is still a good deal away from IF.
---
Nah, just the normal Blizzard imbalance of classes - projected on real-life :D
---
I'm sure you were as I never had such problems playing them at 60. They were known to be very good tanks for damage soaking and the main thing that held them back was the lack of defense cap.
---
For Feral DPS, absolutely not a problem to kill things quickly solo. Really no idea how you are complaining about these two things.
---
Research purpose, wanted to see vanilla without any rose-tinted goggles and instead for what it actually was.
---
I started small and over the years it just grew and grew. When I started collecting, I had no idea blizzard would announce classic half a decade later.
---
10am Pacific
---
I don't know? Did we? Heroic dungeons were challenging. Raids were well designed (ignoring the fact that they came out super broken, just like AQ40). Gearing was a lot more lose giving you way more options. Talents were much improved for many specs actually allowing hybrid classes to be competitive. What was so "shitty design" in tbc?
---
That's the cynical me due to the internet being the internet, but I want so badly for this to be real.
---
Wish I had a sweatcave like this
---
Nelfs do fine.
---
Pickup skinning + your gathering profession you were originally going to have.
---
Use skinning as extra income by selling the leathers you make to vendors because I guarantee no one will be buying them.
---
Once at level 60 switch to your primary profession you were originally going to have and level it to max using all the mats you got from your other gathering profession.
---
I really hope that group finder won’t be a part of classic WoW. Finding a group manually is one of the joys of belonging to a community for me, I made a lot more friends that way too! Taking the time to find a good group is so much more rewarding than clicking a button any day, imo..
---
No changes!
---
Prolonging the magic is still my top 10 favorite albums. Awesome choices!

This is true, apart from having to load into all the buildings which lets it down a bit.

Classic players gatekeeping TBC is the new retail players gatekeeping Classic.
---
I look forward to all the Chuck Norris jokes in barren chat.

Thats why you spec Pom Pyro and feel like a pvp god once every 3 minutes.

Wir haben auch ne Gruppe hier in Augsburg - das wird n fetziges Wochenende :) auf welchem Server spielt ihr? Vielleicht geht ja was zusammen!

nah fuck that i'll give you 3/4ths the price

Loved December Underground 😍😍😍

Long live melee hunters!
---
I was a leader and coordinator for heroics/mythic but oki dokes. My guild was mainly casual and were just a bunch of friends enjoying the game.
---
Uhm, I eat that stuff up until Thursday.
---
Cooked Chicken normally doesn't get bad after 2 nights in the fridge. There are even people in the fitness scene who pre-cook for a whole week.

3 Days is the maximum for me tho.

Games not even out yet, like talking about what's next for x-pack going to be like 2 hours before BFA launches.

No, let the guy do what he wants god damn! Energy drinks? damn right. 
---
Did you never watch Make love Not warcraft Southpark? the guy is a chubster drinking rockstar energy and eating junk food. You're not everyones mother. 
---
We've heard all the super healthy options and frankly nobody cares.
---
Nah, not on pvp realms. Getting to max level and getting into decent gear so you can perform your role in pvp encounters is a critical component that all pvp players, even from retail, understand and have internalized over the years. 
---
Getting farmed because you are behind the curve is not pleasant and nobody wants to be in that situation.
---
I believe PvP is you’re free game anywhere, and in PvE you have to flag yourself to be killable, or if you enter enemy territory you flag yourself. 
---
You can go to Gurubashi Arena in stv to fight people.
---
I disagree.  The game needs to prove that it still has the power to captivate people like it once did.  We are all right now in hype/nostalgia mode and we simply cannot see past launch.  
---
If the game proves itself, then discussion should move towards Classic+
---
In the Americas its the 26th.  3pm pst to be exact.
---
Awesome I'll give that a go next time
---
Sure did.
---
I like this, thanks
---
That's because in Retail no one ever experiences it.
---
***INTEREST YA IN A PINT?***
---
Very interesting poll, fairly good sample size which I guess can be scaled, Shazzrah has a good few thousand players lead if that’s anything to go by
---
Also interesting to see that Alliance will be pretty outnumbered on both of those realms lol
---
I don't think so. Sure I was a bit flippant, obviously I'm not a huge retail fan. But the fundamental idea that there are millions of people who enjoy live and that we should respect that rather than try and "ruin" their game to make it more to our liking still stands, particularly in light of Blizz launching Classic for those of us who want the old style back.
---
Rare drop recipes is probably Blacksmithing, but you'd need a raid's help. Maybe enchanting?
---
Your friend is a fuckin trooper

Your keyboard ain't ready though, that ain't a wow keyboard.

Should run to Walmart and pickup a Corsair K55 real quick for $50, comes with a wrist rest thingy and quiet keys, plus dedicated macro buttons. Plus it has nice rgb like your picture.

“ReTaRd AlErT”

nice repost from yersterday genius
---
Why he hittin the vent p2t button telling them that he’s gonna kill them all? Noob poser....
---
Deadmines deja-vu.... and most wont even know druids can't res either :D ha ha the drama starts here!
---
And if everyone else is on the same stage of the chain and if the quest doesn’t require an item provided by the questgiver. That’s assuming the quest isn’t flagged as Unshareable for some esoteric reason.
---
Yeah, it was weird. Don’t count on anyone else being able to share out quests for you.
---
mmmm empty calories
---
Some people must have strokes watching the Simpsons with Homers illogical eating.
---
Plenty of people are gonna play both, can the elitism and karma whoring
---
PvP servers enable open PvP with the opposite faction. This starts as early as there are hostile players around. 
---
You cannot kill members of your own faction. 
---
And yes early zones are usually just for one faction but that doesn’t mean that enemy players can’t come to that zone and kill you. 
---
Classic has no arenas. And battlegrounds are only available in Phase 3.
---
Name checks out.
---
You got that for me, bro? Would appreciate it!
---
PVP server means that in mid to higher zones, you can attack the oppossing faction at will. Their names will be yellow or red. In lower end zones, you cannot do this.
---
PVE servers, you cannot attack anyone, nor can anyone attack you *unless* you activate PvP mode. Which means that to the other faction your name will be yellow or red, ie: they can attack you. You cannot turn this off or on if you are on a PVP server.
---
Nobody on your own faction can attack you on either type of server.
---
What they mean is that backstab doesn't work from the front so you'll never be able to do any proper damage if you're playing solo since you're always the player who has aggro. In a group other people have aggro so you'll be able to backstab.
---
if you can backstab = daggers
---
 "Frontstabbing"    was backstabing mobs  from front while abusing shitty private server hitboxes
---
Turn off Sticky Targeting, hon.
---
Why is that pathetic? If it’s an indicator of anything it’s an indication that the OP is over 30, and tired of listening to retail players talk about WoW when they have no idea of what the glory days really were like
---
Thanks daddy &lt;3
---
I love my Portrait Monitor. It is perfect for guides, reddit and discord!
---
I... don't? The leveling experience didn't change too significantly from vanilla to wrath, aside from mana regen increasing and it being sped along. It's not a huge stretch to think that was due to similar numbers.
---
And for what its worth I dont think that will be the case here. Most people seem to be those who did it before, theyre the 30% who didnt quit.
---
I feel like the economy is gonna be all manner of messed up due to stuff like this. &gt;.&lt;
---
Should be interesting.
---
I am entertained, this is why I am here
---
Not a fan of corpse runs when trying to level. You shit where you quest and it blows up into a zone-wide war.
---
Right back at ya 🤷‍♂️
---
as a vanilla hunter, i feel like the guys who sat in the battleships in the canal, bombarding the shoreline.
---
doing not much dmg, but having a lot cheaper repair bill.
---
I was originally thinking about going Paladin. They look awesome and I like the heal/fight combo. Played as a pally before and generally quite enjoyed myself. But seen a lot of people hate on pally, especially the seemingly a slow grind? 
---
I'm thinking about tailoring/skinning as professions. Maybe mage/priest would be better suited next to those professions. I'm sure I'll be running around solo sometimes (going in solo, hope to find some people to play with on the go) and priest might be a bit tough solo? I'm not to familiar with the priest spells, any fun spells or is that only for mages? 
---
Is pally that bad? How are Priest for questing? 
---
Ps. Probably going human, alliance on Zandalar Tribes (RP PvP EU)
---
I dont have a dad
---
Sorry for useless message, saving for later.
---
once you have full stacks you mail them to an alt.
---
*ignore the "run outside" part
---
It depends on your mindset, if you are only happy if you get the best gear, then you won't be happy as a casual player, unlike retail where you can get a full set of epics easily.
---
But I'm fine with just seeing how far I can get with the time I have.
---
Your yellow attacks can dodge though. More weapon skill helps over come that by .1% per point:
---
&gt; If the target is a mob:
---
    DodgeChance = 5% + (TargetLevel*5 - AttackerSkill) * 0.1%
---
Usually if you are running dungeons and doing some quests you will get a better two hander by 45-48, not by even trying too hard.  You would almost have to avoid an upgrade to use it all the way to 60. When AV comes out Ice Barbed Spear is a super easy to get huge upgrade at lvl 50.
---
ok so even as a human i go for daggers then ?
---
I will see you on thr Battlefield Horde Scum.

Just as long as you don't begin deleting greens and blues in pursuit of your "final solution"

See you in STV
---
This guy gets it.
---
I understand it's a sword guide, but there's no reason to restrict your weapon type before you can get sword spec, that's all I'm saying.
---
All about that Orange! Trump foresaw this and has been supporting team Legendary for years now!
---
Diablo 2 is my favorite game ever but I don’t want a remake. Diablo 2 is still completely playable and tons of fun. I’d rather see Blizzard make things right by doing Diablo 4 in a way that would make the D2 devs and fans proud.
---
What do you mean blue? It's gold.
---
Quiet keys, why
---
  PvP = everyone is flagged all the time.   
---
  PvE = You have to flag yourself to opt in to it.  
---
  You can't attack your own faction and yes early on many of the zones are either Horde or Alliance only but there are many that are neutral with quest hubs for both where you'll run in to each other a lot.
---
  You can still duel on PvE servers.  You send someone a request to do it and if they accept you both get flagged to fight each other until someone dies and then you're both unflagged again.  
---
  There are no queuable arenas however there are arenas in the world like Gurubashi which will be heavily populated all the time with people dueling and whatnot.
---
I think this map is from the early patches.
---
I am glad to say they are updated and ready to go! :)
---
2 letter name not bad, just made my gnome mage got the name “potions” :)
---
What if they say, why did you delete all your gear on all your characters and boasted about it on reddit, don't think you deserve to get it back.
---
What is the chance of being disconnected? 
---
33.3%... repeating of course
---
Just try them each for a couple levels and see what’s up?
---
It indeed is bittersweet
---
For me the journey that stuck with me the most was getting to Desolace. It was such a big awkward journey for any race and from memory was the first nuetral zone in the progression.
---
I usually respec resto around 55.
---
Realm queues will be there regardless, I don’t see how having any % of players already through the login servers would increase queues?
---
Love to hear it! I'm excited to sit in que for the rest of the night!! Haha
---
Work at SDI, Auburn gonna be busy this week with the upcoming car show.
---
Come on! List us in LFG again or we will sit here forever waiting for a replacement!
---
There was a loop hole back then. The basic game provided you with a month of free game time. I didn't read it back then, I was so excited about the game.
---
Discovered the true the hard way, but I did try to put a random number as credit card out of frustration, it worked... I was in, for a month I was really scared that someone somewhere was gonna find me and I will go to jail for it (was 13 back then).
---
Turned out, blizzard check the credit card when payment was due, so at the end of the free month.
---
I had time to spare change for a time card. 
---
And boy was I a happy kind thinking I "hacked" blizzard for a month.
---
Yeah, I knew a guy who grinded out rank 14 about a month before TBC. There were green quest rewards within the first couple of levels of TBC that were better than his HWL gear. He was justifiably salty as hell.
---
Best professions for a night elf druid? I'm thinkinh Herb/alchemy.  Suggestions?
---
RP is great. You'll find slightly less focus on PvE in the community, but if you're not a hardcore raider it literally doesn't impact your experience at all. The people are always nicer.
---
I don't know much about RuneScape but I suggest go on YouTube and find "madseason" and he has a couple of videos on how to prepare for classic and they cater to beginners as well as older players.
---
Yea they are pricey but worth it, I feel its the difference between a 12 hour stint and a 16 hour marathon.
---
Yeah well it's only good thing about it has 3 charges. Druids need those stat sticks
---
Where is Mankriks wife?
---
why would i pay for a 15yr old game guide lol
---
I want to druid tank dungeons. Only raid I'm interested in is ony. *maybe* zg. 
---
Molten core was never fun. At its peak with a good guild i considered friends, bwl was barely fun, once in awhile I guess. 
---
But dungeons were usually fun.
---
How good/bad is 'Trash Blade' compared to the pre-bis choices for a fury warrior at 60?
---
You must play a shaman
---
You gonna die
---
If playing consistently with group, yes. If you'll also be playing solo it might be easier to go swords the whole time and take the slight decrease in DPS when in group.
---
lol well Modern Warfare Remastered
---
There was a time when people got along just find without quest helpers. Does that answer your question? Honestly you dont need it, and if you get stuck you can spend 5 mins and look it up.
---
i wanna play with grandpa but i wont be on that server :(
---
Cause the clicking is annoying to some. Imaging you're trying to play game and you have someone in your ear yelling click every half a second.
---
CLICK.. CLICK CLICK. CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.
---
.................CLICK.
---
Too bad they aren't answering the most important question: could you explain the exact nature of the disconnect grace period ? Kind of a big deal with 1-6 hour queues.
---
I have that map on my wall next to my computer.
---
Dude im definitely taking that teriyaki pork idea.  Looks awesome.  Cheers
---
great thanks
---
Ha, I used process of elimination to remove them one by one and paladin was the very first one I removed, you couldn't pay me to play that in vanilla.
---
Prot AOE tank leveling during Wrath was absolutely amazing though, pull 10 mobs solo out in the world and consecrate + hammer them all down
---
Ah yes, if your scale doesn't start at 12 and end just before 12 how would it make any sense?
---
Iron grenades are cheap af and a total gamechanger for some classes, particularly paladins. For the player on a budget, you can basically run with nothing but reusable items and iron grenades and still give yourself a very nice edge in pvp. You'll pick up enough gold to fund your grenades by accident.
---
Dont forget magnesium and soudium from somwhere
---
That protein-cheese-salami-thing in the left looks fucking awesome. I want it
---
"you're scaring me, what's up" is the true polarity of conversation between friends haha.
---
Thanks, I'll have to give it a look and see how I like it.
---
I assure you this question will be asked hundreds of times even after today.
---
He means before they go back to normal eating and schedules. "Kiddo".
---
I'm ready to be taken [https://imgur.com/HaCvOnl](https://imgur.com/HaCvOnl)
---
you can heal fine in dungeons with a full dps spec (especially when you got some healer gear). Just beware that you don't have a ooc revive ;)
---
Mostly preference for some. I prefer Bartender myself for its setup and configurability. They both do the job though.
---
Did you just steal a meme that was posted on here earlier this week, add a minute of fortunate sons, and repost it here?
---
Ah my bad.
---
I thought RIFT had potential but i could never forgive it for not being WoW
---
Love the backpack full of MCP
---
I'm in a similar boat.  I'm torn between Mage/Warlock or Druid/Shaman.  I know if I pick the later I'll most likely be healing which isn't too bad but I also play healer in FFXIV and I don't know if I want to play all healing all the time.
---
Were there issues with pets in Beta?  Hopefully they'd be fixed.  Hunters aren't bad for raids I'm sure.  I know they aren't mages but they'll still do solid dps.
---
The Nakd smoothie just to counteract all the shittyness from the rest! Haha
---
I can't decide between mage and warlock, played warlock a little in vanilla, and was my main until Cata. Idk whether to relive past glories with something I know or try something entirely new. Will be playing with a Shadow Priest friend the whole way.

[Horde] [EU] [Shazzrah - PvP] [Semi-Hardcore Raiding and Social/PVP Guild] &lt;The Undecided&gt;
---
About us: We’re a guild of old and new friends alike, with a core team of players who have end-game raiding and PVP experience in every expansion since Vanilla. We have all decided to completely swap over to Classic and are incredibly excited to be able to reform our guild and re-experience the magic of the original game that got us all hooked. While we all love the raiding element of WoW, many of us have an equal passion for PVP which means we will certainly be organizing regular PVP events and raids.
---
Our Goal: Our primary goal is to be a serious progression raiding guild on Shazzrah while simultaneously building a large community of skilled, mature, and socially minded players as we believe a good community is at the heart of anyone’s potential enjoyment of Classic WoW. We have a dedicated team of officers in our guild who have all held leadership positions in various guilds with heaps of guild management and raid leading experience which will help us stay highly competitive while maintaining a semi-hardcore raiding schedule.
---
Raiding days and times: Wednesday/Thursday/Sunday – 19:00 to 23:00 UK time
---
Loot system: Loot council
---
Plan of action : Build a large community of players to make the levelling process as easy and enjoyable as possible. Once 60, most of our core members will aim to to start forming dungeon groups as soon as possible in order to gear up and get ready for raiding.
---
Our Expectations for core raiders: We expect you to be max level within the first two months of classic. Ideally you will be 60 in the first month to allow you ample time to gear up with the rest of our core members before raiding starts. The faster you hit 60 the easier it will be for all of us to effortlessly form dungeon groups and start farming! Additionally, we expect our core raiders to always carry consumables as well as enchanted gear.
---
Who are we looking for : We are a diverse and international group of players with various backgrounds who share a passion for all things WoW. We are looking for similarly minded Players who are happy to embrace Classic and everything it has to offer.
---
How to apply : If you are interested and would like apply to be a core raider then please submit an application on the following link:
---
forms.gle/nqtjbVEg9r3pbxqg7
---
For our core raiding team, we are happy to consider anyone who meets our criteria, has similar goals and is looking to be part of our dedicated raiding team. If you would like to join as a social or PVP member and are interested in our guild then please don’t hesitate to reach out to one of our officers on the below details who would all be more than happy to have a chat with you.

+95% of the english eu servers will speak english, a far cry from that is located in the UK or Ireland.

I don't think AV is open at launch.

No, it's Patrick

The only remotely healthy thing you have there is grocery sushi

I was a belf hunter when I first started playing back in bc now going for a gnome lock

You are missing the most important part

What a time to be alive that was 😅

Both.

Turn off the lights, kneel Infront of a mirror in the center of a circle of thirteen candles paint the symbol of your faction onto your forehead with the blood of a virgin and chant #nochanges backwards thirteen times and Chris metzen will appear and give you your next instructions

---
50% chance at 30 mins CD ... good luck with that - dont res the wrong type either :D
---
What you are going to see is people using iron grenades which cost almost nothing but give you a huge bonus. If you are not using them that’s on you
---
It's not even just escape artist, 5% int and +15 engineering are really good racials too.
---
/dance
---
holy shit bro whats up! its boo!
---
I hope the classic team retained the hard lessons from WoD's launch
---
You can use a quest helper for convenience and you can read the quests if you want to be fully immersed. If you are not familiar with vanilla quests at some point you will have to use external sources for some of them anyway.
---
That chili looks like ass
---
I agree, there is a touch of naivety out there for those that do double gathering professions to prepare for a mount and in the same breath state they will switch for engineering... I dont think they realize that it will be eons before they have their 60 mount and training.
---
“Blow me”is just hated
---
True classic experience? Don't use it. There was no quest helper in Classic.
---
CBA? use a quest helper.
---
Human Rogue, Oceanic PVP.
---
CEST ;) just start it 21minutes before the launch!
---
I agree.  I feared I'd be deleted for mentioning them, which usually happens in /r
---
The chances of you getting 40 people raid ready that fast is indeed miniscule, which is why you start poaching people that ding early :P
---
TBC plus is coming. Blizzard won't force you to transition to it, but most people will. And you will want to, as you run out of content.
---
That said, I used my "Neltharion's tear" for a long long time in TBC and I remember a tank who was using his T3 set for quite a while at level 70.
---
I can't wait for people to wonder why healers are ressing 1 person at a time.... "Use Mass Res you noob!"
---
Right, but do they go will with Codex or do they do the same thing?
---
I wish devs would put some cheering dwarf NPCs around the road of the Thelsmar pass. This would let NE journiers know that the marathon run to IF is nearly over.
---
Priest 5/5 talents = 25% wand damage
---
Mage 2/2 talents = 25% wand damage
---
Everyone is talking about how terrible sugar is for you and generally I agree. But if you can also keep it under 40 grams an hour you won't be getting diabetes anytime soon. Fat maybe but not diabetes. And even on the fat thing it depends on what else you eat.
---
More than anything tho I wish people would understand that most people posting pics like yours aren't eating it all at once..
---
You download via [b.net](https://b.net). On the wow tab look above the launch or install button You should see a drop-down that allows you to pick Classic.
---
It's brought up all the time.
---
At this point i need people to give me the positives of going Human besides they look cooler.  I want to believe...
---
Its faster to put points into holy damage talents after youve taken wand spec and spirit tap. You then respec to shadow at 40 and take wand spec again, then go down the disc tree.
---
The spirits are restless
---
Wish I didn’t have work this week.. I would binge!
---
haha stellar advise my man appreciated!
---
I am certainly not saying they made the right decision.  I think they should have opened more servers sooner.  
---
Blizzard is clearly betting that 90% of the player base leaves the game within a few months.  I think the tourism number is closer to 50%-60%.
---
You downrank to preserve mans situationally
---
Where do people get these ideas? I'm on this sub a ton and this is the first time I've heard of it. Warriors hit hard and farm decently, it's not like they're a healer like a shaman or anything.
---
Vr46 branded monster. My favorite flavor, less chemical tasting than regular energy drinks.
---
that's the kind of answer I was looking for :)
---
Wasn't sure if I could the healing in dungeons is good enough as shadow since i don't want to respec often, thanks a lot :)
---
To be fair... I'd rather eat my calories than drink them as well... But I do like the flavor of the Zero's more than the regular.. lol
---
[My response.](https://vocaroo.com/i/s16B2jNMx63c)
---
I've pretty much had to recently start my life from scratch so I've been preparing how I can... I've got back an old monitor of mine, wiped and installed W10 on an old laptop, got a new keyboard and mouse, made myself a new desk, I even booked some time off to play on release. Since WoW worked on my laptop when I last played it, I assumed it would still work now.
---
Turns they stopped support for the 32 bit client on release of BFA. I had no idea until I tried installing wow yesterday :(
---
I really wish I could but humans are garbage for non-melee. :(
---
Go back to school and ask for education in time zones.
---
First, you can heal just fine as a shadow priest. It's not going to keep you out of any 5mans.
---
Second, you can level just fine as holy. Priest leveling is insanely efficient. Just be sure to pick up Spirit Tap or Wand spec first, take both if you really want to turbo charge leveling. Once you have one of those talents, just go holy. Holy Fire -&gt; SW:P -&gt; MB -&gt; smite if you need, otherwise just wand them down is insanely efficient and doesn't really benefit from shadow talents all that much.
---
If you don't use consumables because they're expansive, then I've already beat you in one part of the game.
---
Wanding is good DPS early and really throughout the leveling process and is meant to be a “closer” when attacking a mob. 
---
When you switch to wanding you start a 5 second countdown on mana regen that allows you to level more efficiently. For some classes like
---
Priest it basically means they will never have to stop and drink.
---
mostly social.
---
Good man, have a nice ride home and enjoy the launch!
---
US - whatever faction - PvP and PvE 
---
Hi - I'm based in Europe but thinking of rolling on USA realms for language and community - any guilds that raid morning eastern?
---
Omg, when was the last time you really enthusiastically *DING!* - ed when leveling???? Nine hours and I woke up at 4am thinking about it.
---
any vid recommendations for fat people?
---
well I am one of the people who posted my snacks/Rig I find it really interesting the different choices people make when it comes to snacks, it really varies from country to country.
---
Because it's so basic that there's no point in mentioning it.  
---
Besides, it's mostly just Iron Grenades for the interrupt and you get 2 x Iron Grenade for 1 Iron Bar, 1 Heavy Blasting Powder and 1 Silk Cloth.
---
I only started the rogue life at the end of WoD, so I don't know anything about how the class was before then. Care to share any tips about rogues in vanilla? It's my favorite class. Also I'd like to know what other classes I should look out for, what are we weak against in vanilla pvp?
---
Actually, you just proved his.
---
I played the fuck out of vanilla WoW, and I was not ready to move on to TBC when it was released. I will not be ready to do so this time, either.
---
Won't be classic unless my zepplin dumps me in Stonetalon!
---
I played a rogue in eq. My ability to solo was nonexistent.  
---
I often went days doing nothing but running around advertising to try and get a group as dps. 
---
I finally gave up on my rogue I think at 52 with epic because I just couldn't stand sitting at dungeon entrances for hours at a time hoping for a group. 
---
So I changed to my shaman who would get tells for groups when I logged on, and I'd be like ,"nah, I'm gonna solo some dragons today since they're up."
---
Save your gold! Shits hard to come by in classic and more so because there won’t be much of an economy.
---
Rolling out as three Taurens ... what level should we wait for to actually party up?  I believe there’s an exp disadvantage to partying together too early, but I’m wondering how big and how long?
---
And thank you.  Love the idea of this thread!
---
I actually got time off of work for this lol. Sitting here giddy as hell for my all nighter with the boys
---
What about ads
---
Middle ground. Just get a coordinates add-on and consult wowhead.
---
Oh look, a hunter weapon meme
---
Engineering can be great for gold making too, making and selling consumables for a premium to people who are too lazy to make the items themselves
---
As a priest, even if you go shadow for leveling, spirit is your top stat. With spirit tap its just so important for reducing leveling downtime. Which conveniently helps healing dungeons a lot.
---
And, something most people don't talk about, you actually put out really high dps for a healer. Priests want to take advantage of the 5 second regen rule, so you usually end up wanding quite a bit in lower level dungeons (watch your threat), and it makes dungeons a cake-walk.
---
Well you’d pay 100% for a 0 sec cast + walking effort so why not?
---
Got an UHD 620 on my CPU, thats all I have for the next 2 days, but it runs BFA pretty well, as long as youre not in a raid!
---
Classic will probably run even better!
---
And F
---
It took you till today to dump the steaming pile of turd that is BFA?
---
I hope you are right because that’s what I’m doing.
---
iirc this video was satire
---
you gonna have that good sex with your monitor tonight?
---
It's actually possible to bypass the list, at least it used to be. It's was client-side. No idea about the retail client though.
---
I personally find resilience annoying because it's not good for open world pve,  but if I get ganked in pve gear its game over.
---
Not with in game addons
---
Did he tell you after he showed it to you that it was only half of the world?
---
No way asmon gets locked out, Him and a few others will get a pass. They are free advertisement for the game. If they are in queue for an hour before they can play that is not going to make people want to play.
---
Same.  Played league last night as a last hurrah and now I’m done lol.  I won’t miss it!
---
Legion and bfa launches were buttery smooth. The only difference this time is the artificial cap on layers
---
Was gonna be warrior to relive my days of being a Tauren Warrior in BC, but I figured I'd do something new and avoid that painful leveling and fighting for gear that warrior's get and instead do Priest.
---
Tazdingouch the Troll will be seeing you.
---
My feelings exactly, i am tired of feeling like the game is a race to max level in order to have fun, the feeling i get in retail WoW currently.
---
all these people chomping at the bit to race to 60 are completely missing the point of Vanilla.
---
tyvm, very kind of you.
---
LotRO was a great WoWclone back in its day. The expansions, as seems to be the theme in this genre, really ruined it though.
---
Do you even print screen bro?
---
Upvote for uninstalling league.
---
I thought servers open at 3pm. Why is everyone saying midnight
---
Thanks for the in depth response!
---
I just want to play every spec on every calss dude. The choice is killing me. I eventually am going with what fits the best in my group of friends/guild. But I will surely reroll pretty soon, and repeatedly until I have a char of every class.
---
BG's won't be out for a while so you're going to have to wait regardless but some of the reputation items are very worth it for PVE and people will want to get pvp ranks for prestige so I doubt it'll be an issue.
---
Happy to help- Good luck!
---
I was 12, I didn't start playing until late 05/early 06, around the time the AQ Gates were opened. So I guess I would've been 13 by then.
---
Respecicng isn't a viable option.  IMO this is the biggest downside to classic.  
---
So here's what you do...  Tank all the PVE content you care to in phase one and 2.  Roll on 2 Handers and dps gear (remember no resilience in Classic so PVE epics are just as good as PVP gear)  in Phase 3 Respec go balls deep on some mofos with all your epics in all the BG's that are released in phase 3.  You still won't get to rank 14 because you are a filthy casual like the rest of us but you can ruin some peoples day in your hard earned gear.
---
PS: For the Horde!
---
Yeah sure. I just don't know if people in other countries speak English among themselves.
---
Ha it's all low carb, diet mt dew. Only iffy is the 2g carb per red bull which I only drink 1 or 2 of a day max.
---
That's fair. I likely am not alone though. That said, theme park shit definitely made me laugh.
---
haha, no worries. It's missing the the front 3/4.
---
It’s just snacks not like they’re making life choices over here.
---
Not only can I not decide on a class I have two group of friends on completely different servers.  Ugh.
---
I assumed 'dyking' was the problem.
---
This hurt on an emotional level. So many of my friends quit trough the expansions that by pre cata launch only 2 out of 31 of us who actualy knew eachother IRL were left. Now back at it again when this shit launches ni... nig... nice
---
Here friend, educate thine self.

They just want to give you the true vanilla experience.
---
...interesting! I'm going to investigate immediately!
---
Please dont give me false hope!!
---
In the air, the player you're chasing won't have to deal with things like mobs in their way that can potentially daze them
---
I think in a couple of hours, blizzard will be opening more servers as well as removing the 3 character cap. 10am PDT ibelieve
---
i love ur cat
---
Logistics friend.
---
Though the game may call me a warrior, I am in reality, a quartermaster. With alchemical vials, explosives and bandages I overpower my enemies.
---
Not that anyone should care about her, but how do you not know who Kim Kardashian is lmao
---
Shadow priests are the exception as most of their gear is still going to have some sort of int on it. A shammy with full enh gear is going to be running out of mana in like 3-4 heals with next to no regeneration, so any extended fight is gonna be pretty tough.
---
Low effort memes anyone?
---
I don’t think so sadly
---
No. Any new content stapled to a fifteen year old game is going to feel awkward and incongruous, and there’s no guarantee it’d be of the same quality or design ethos. TBC was great, it’s worth revisiting. They just need to release it on its own servers with the option to clone your classic character over to TBC.
---
And before someone mentions Old School Runescape, OSRS’s new community voted content *also feels awkward and incongruous to the original content that the game had back then*
---
Also, you sound like every single dink on Live who brigaded against classic coming out at all.
---
I can help you with the lore.
---
At first you built a circle building with red tribal markings, this would let you create peons. Than you select those peons and need to click on the mine or the trees and they will bring the resource back to the circle.
---
That's how it all started.
---
Tbh if you're not RP walking everywhere are you even really playing the game???
---
Picking the wrong (class)quest rewards or vendoring them.
---
Some (class)items are incredibly usefull, like the Warlock trinket that gives you free Voidwalker summons (and I think also instant?).
---
Basic rule: If one item has a wacky effect and the other is just +damage, check if the wacky effect is special by googling it and checking the WoWhead comments.
---
Omg 1hr. Glad i have astrall recall
---
If they aren’t salaried — good jokes.
---
For what its worth - I think its a lot *easier* to play classic casually. For the most part - there's a finite amount of stuff you can do (which is a good thing).
---
I played retail for a few months last year and had to stop. There was just too many daily/weekly things you feel like you *had* to do or get that FOMO. Its great on Blizzard's part for getting people engaged, but hard for me anyway to manage that.
---
Playing Classic beta a few months ago felt so refreshing  and relaxing having just a few objectives and not a million things popping up on  my display. Even if some of the QoL thigns aren't there it just takes you back to when the game was simple
---
5 new PVP realms are opening at 7PM. See you online!
---
Most semi-hardcore to hardcore guilds are coordinating efforts for the raiding the first couple weeks though. The guild I'm in has connections with about 9-10 other larger guilds on the server and the officers are coordinating a Labor Day raid for those that rushed to 60 between the guilds.  
---
I think if you rush to 60 it'll be pretty easy to find a group to run with while waiting for the rest of your guild.
---
right there 2 on medium
---
That depends. Some boss fights could use more ranged DPS when they have some explosion or similar abilities that force melee DPS to stay away most of the time.
---
Was looking for an updated Auctionator, thanks!
---
I get a 7am start time here and I'm still on vacation the next few days. 
---
Yay for Japan start time;
---
Waltet
---
Yeah I don't think the stress test and name reservation will be an indicator on what's to come. I think the actual number of players trying to login at the same time will be substantially higher, filling every server and not only will there be long queues, we might break the actual login servers. But I guess we will see.
---
Yep. (And you'd do that anyway, since you need different stats.)
---
Not to mention that's Microsoft Surface Book. A higher end laptop
---
well private servers are using original 1.12 client while classic is using forked bfa client 1.13 so... not totally comparable...
---
Horde player here.
---
Allience is easier in all content be it raid or Pvp. They are favored in Pvp by blizzard and racial skills and talents are more powerful for raids.
---
Horde is just really good at being a thorn in allience side &gt;:3 also you play horde if you loved warcraft cause thrall
---
I wish it would’ve drowned out from your mind before you made this post.
---
*Laughs in veteran*
---
But who am I kidding, we'll wipe on my first dungeon run because tanks aren't invincible threat machines and DPS will facepull everything as is tradition.
---
I don't doubt it. I feel like this sub is encouraging it to some degree, regardless of whether or not they're joking.
---
We can learn from this an improve.
---
There are so many things in life an 18 year old cant conceive of that a 40 year old has experienced years ago.  So if by "fine" you mean "legal," then yeah.  It's certainly on the weird side for the 40 year old.
---
1: Asmon gets priority queue.
---
2: Players jump to newly created servers avoiding queues. Blizzards follows their contingency plan.
---
3: First 60 in less than 5 days /played.
---
4: First 60 before Sunday.
---
5: First Rag kill by end of September.
---
6: First Onyxia kill by end of September.
---
7: I hit 60 before WW3 aka Phase 2.
---
I’m off for 3.5 days, the goal is 40.
---
Are you kidding me man, our social lives are going to flourish with how many new people we’ll meet FeelsAmazingMan

Same here, leaving work at 2 today. The lead up to leaving is going to feel like an eternity.
---
Thanks, but yeah its not as bright as it seems in person and you don't really see the shelf lights when you sitting.
---
Most likely Jenkins.
---
As in Leeroy Jenkins!
---
You do quests and kill things.
---
You're welcome friend.
---
You probably won't need to go full resto until close to 60. Might as well contribute to DPS in the meantime.
---
I'll be uninstalling fortnite lmao
---
You can also make them super easy. Just bake a few grams of fresh parm and presto!
---
They would have to overhaul most of the endgame systems, overhaul classes to make them more unique and niche again, and completely remove automated systems like LFR/G in order to get me to touch retail again.

As you said, it's beyond saving at this point.

Is there a frame of andy violently yeeting woody into the trash? if so that would be more accurate

that has never happened to me and i played on rppvp from tbc to cata and regular rp from cata until now
---
so a communal piss bucket or does each person get their own individual bottle (and funnel)?
---
Reminds me of when WoW came out when I was in HS. Oh lads..
---
Yeah, wow was made to play how you want so sure go for it. All I’m saying is we should try our best not to neglect the game that has changed all our lives over the past 15+ years and has had many people put countless hours into developing new content for us. If everyone starts playing classic, what’s going to happen to people’s jobs at blizz? A game that already has all its content doesn’t need developers like LIVE does
---
Mind your MoW timers and spell ranks.
---
Agreed 100% being social was just one of the thing that made vanilla so awesome. The last thing we need is a bunch of addons that remove that.
---
Thanks, its RGB so you can tune it your liking.
---
Ok sorry, lets remove the 1 mount and say wow tokens
---
Now lets say normal subs, wow tokens, all store mounts, pets &amp; cosmetic changes, faction/server changes... how is classic wows sub count doing compared to them put together? classics pathetic $15 a month is a joke now huh...  Retail will never be killed by anything.

I fucking hate retail, I'm just telling it how it is.

Healthy people already pay for everyone else's health issues.  That's how insurance risk pools work.  The healthy always subsidize the sick/injured, otherwise the system becomes unsustainable.    You do not exist in a vacuum where only your health costs are considered.
---
Every time someone without insurance goes to the ER instead of a doctor, that drives the costs up for everyone else.  Every time they can't afford that ER bill and the hospital has to eat the cost, that drives the costs up for everyone else.
---
Elite is kitable. Whole chain *is* soloable. It is in no way, shape or form easy however.
---
I would add, some upgrades will benefit some classes more, like a nice 2h for a warrior or a nice main hand for a rogue. And some classes get mobility handed to them and mounts are less important, but overall once you start buying greens/blues on the ah, its hard to stop.
---
Better do a rush. We have it set up so 10 of our gnomes/dwarves will be grinding 1s on login then rushing IF where they trade the GM and purchase/sign the charter. If you think your guild name might go early I'd recommend you do the same.

Go shadow. You can heal as a shadow priest until level \~40.

As someone who was server famous for ganking Isle of Quel'Danas (I was a 2k full vengeful elemental or enhancement shaman depending on what spec I wanted to roll, I had both sets, and I was out ganking IoQD every day) the best wpvp I could find was either ganking people doing dailies in outland or in isle of quel'danas.
---
It wasn't nearly as fun as vanilla. The options to what you could do were limited, and not only that, but it felt way more like retail wpvp before they added warmode (just go check the world quests and if someone is doing them, there ya go, gank them... just replace "world quests" with "dailies" and its basically the same thing.
---
I've played every xpac except for BFA, and I don't miss BC at all. To me, BC represents what went wrong with WoW to start the decline of wpvp. 
---
Was it a bad xpac? Nah, it didn't have enough time to be "too far gone" like BFA.. but it killed a lot of what made wpvp great.
---
No longer could you fight someone and beat their ass to where they'd run off but you could go hunt them down due to both of you being on foot... now, once the fight is over, it's over... they just fly off...
---
Classic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TBC all day even with the class changes
---
&gt;Perfect summary. Thanks a lot bud!
---
I actually want that shit. My favorite part of AV is questing, upgrading the guards, getting the summons out. You only have time for ~1 quest turn-in if people are rushing the boss.
---
The time you've spent to makes this post, could have been used to go the official forum and lookup that message... its kinda above.

Should have reported him to blizz and got his account banned for account trading.
---
I tried leveling a Lock on a PServer (PVP) and when I hit Stonetalon Mountains around Lvl 20ish, I was ganked by a skull Rogue for like 30 minutes until I logged out. It was a really "fun and fair" battle as he killed me with one hit. I stopped playing on that server at that moment. 
---
I like organised and fair PvP (Rank 10 in Classic), but OpenPvP? No thank you. It sounds cool, but it's 99% ganking and corpse runs. We had SS vs TM and XR battles on our PvE server by the way, people will turn on /pvp and join most of the time.
---
If ya don’t want to be bothered with the frustration of a death &amp; runback... don’t play pvp. 
---
Personally - I always thought it was fun so I’m gonna play pvp. When I was finishing a quest in an area and saw an alliance guy killing multiple mobs or a tougher mob, I’d snag damage on the target &amp; blow him up, wait for the threat to transfer to me &amp; take his kill. 
---
It can suck, but it was great to have another layer to the game. Personally, I feel it’s a fun little “game within the game”.  You can avoid 99% of it and most players grinding levels aren’t gonna bother ya. 
---
Also pre-raid spots on raid nights when you arrive early to the staging area was always a fun little bloodbath.
---
Tips yeah but I'll be playing mage in groups I expect to make a bunch of food to give out not going to sit there like 1g a stack or gtfo.
---
There's absolutely nothing wrong with playing PvE. Some people don't like tanking or world PvP and that's fine. Some people don't have the time to invest another 1/8th to 1/2 of playtime due to world PvP like they did before. That's fine. 
---
Because honestly we don't all have the luxury of enjoying "the full Vanilla experience". I don't

Thanks for the reminder :)

What?  No it isn't.

I played a priest as my first toon so no argument there.

It’s funny because the only thing ridiculous is your comment. They can report on whatever they want. Imagine the news only reported the worst things that could possibly happen.

Welcome back, I haven't played since 2012. Excited to start up again.

These last couple of hours almost feel worse than the last couple of weeks... Im so bored

Just make sure to check between the legs before getting too serious.

might do alright with PinkSparkles sitting at the reception desk

Thanks for the feedback!

Probably depends on when the data was from, this screenshot is from last vanilla, they were likely higher earlier on.

&gt;/cast \[@mouseover, harm,nodead, exists\]\[\] spellname \[mod:shift\] spellname \[mod:alt\]spellname
---
The stuff between brackets are \[conditions\] for that spell to trigger, right. The empty \[\] brackets sets the condition to anything-goes, and is usually the condition you want absolutely last in your macro. Anything after it won't ever trigger cause the \[\] condition is always true, sort of like a catch-all clause. In your example, the shift and alt mods will never trigger.
---
Here is an example of a macro for triggering on mouseover (first prio) or your target (second prio), for nomodifier, shift and alt. Looks  something like this:
---
/cast \[nomodifer,@mouseover,harm,nodead,exists\]\[nomodifier\] spellname1 \[mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead,exists\]\[mod:shift\] spellname2 \[mod:alt, @mouseover,harm,nodead,exists\]\[mod:alt\] spellname3

I've played on both PvP and PvE realms. One of my favorite old school MMOs was DAoC, which was virtually ENTIRELY PvP. Warhammer was great too. I play lots of PvP centric games, from shooters to MOBA. I like some PvP.
---
Having said that, it is so, so easy to romanticize ganking and the way it "makes the world feel alive". 99% of encounters on a PvP server will be hilariously one sided. It's either you getting blown up by someone who vastly outlevels or outnumbers you, or visa versa. And if faction imbalance ever sets in, the server withers up incredibly quickly, as the outnumbered faction will flee in droves. 
---
Only roll PvP server if you have enormous patience, and tolerance/enthusiasm for getting steamrolled.
---
To quote Marlo Stanfield: "You want it to be one way. But it's the other way."
---
okay will try it, thanks
---
why do people continually link to wayback machine and other caching sites when literally none of the links that you have to pay there works...
---
I mained an orc hunter, and I'm thinking to do it again just for comfort level but part of me really thinks I should do something completely different.
---
Druid tanks are great at tanking adds and trash packs, and they can certainly tank bosses. However, as a healer it can be quite frustrating seeing the bear tank's HP pinballing all over the place due to crushing blows, less armor etc.  
---
That said, I encourage you all to play whatever you want, you could clear all content with most people in the raid being sub-optimal speccs.  
---
Not all speccs are optimal, but most are certainly viable.
---
My whole guild told me to make the journey so leveling would be easier with a group, with little instructions my Druid made the trip.  Can't wait to do it again!

Hi vinbrained,
---
You're correct that there is an xp disadvantage for grouping together, but to be completely honest with you I have no idea of any actual numbers on the topic!
---
I'm sorry that I can't answer this- Hopefully someone else will see it and can answer it. 
---
I guess it depends largely on how much you value leveling quickly vs how much you want to level together!
---
I'm glad you like the idea of the thread!
---
Little did they know that in 12 years, parents would be pushing their kids to play more Fortnite so they could land a scholarship...

I played fairly hardcore the first time around, being 16 without a girlfriend and only a part time job made that easy. Now as a 30 year old with a house, wife, baby, full time job etc I will be playing much much more casual this time around. I don't know how much fun the end game is going to be, but I don't plan on being there for a long time. I want to take my time and take it all in while keeping my professions up to date the entire time.

I have heard this same argument from both sides, funnily enough. When I was initially playing horde it was 'all the little kiddies will want to play the 'good guys' so you will have more adults on horde' and later on when I played alliance post cata it was 'edgelord teens wanna play as the bad guys, more adults on alliance'. I am curious what the actual age breakdown will be.

I would reccomend just leveling feral. As long as you keep healing gear on you, you will be fine.

No windfury/flametongue/frostbrand/rockbiter all overwrite each other.  Only one can exist at a time.  As a shaman, you always get a better effect casting the buff on yourself than using the totem.

Ahh I see

It is mainly for stream monitoring or watching videos in the background while playing games.
---
I know and thanks
---
Agreed man. Agreed all day. I think the only thing that will convince these people this is for when Classic and TBC servers are opened up along side each other (if that happens. probably will)
---
They will see for themselves that TBC wpvp is basically just world quest ganking like legion was, but with daily quests instead of world quests.
---
Would rather stay on classic forever tbh. I remember my first week at 70 in BC, I vividly remember the feeling "man I miss vanilla"
---
That feeling never left me.

What the actual fuck? What was the mouse for? Nevermind, i dont want to know.

**&lt;Stormwell&gt; | EU | Alliance | PvP (Firemaw)**
---
**Guild Info**
---
Stormwell is a semi-casual, progression raiding guild looking for new likeminded members! 
---
With us you'll find a friendly and active community, a weekly game night, and a fun but dedicated Classic
---
WoW experience. Our goal is to create a less hardcore environment, and instead focus on a friendly and 
---
relaxed atmosphere for everyone, while still having an organised raid for people to progress through.
---
We pride ourselves on having zero tolerance on toxicity, whether you are inexperienced or a veteran, you 
---
can find a welcoming and positive home with us.
---
**Raid Info**
---
Our planned raid times are \*\*19:30-22:30 CET on Fridays and Saturdays\*\*, and we use loot council to
---
distribute loot.
---
Our core roster will mostly consist of viable specs, though "meme specs" are accepted in moderation,
---
and treated like any other raider. Discuss with an officer if you have an interest in playing such a spec to 
---
determine whether there is space.
---
For core raiders we expect at least 80% attendance.However if you do need to occasionally miss a raid,
---
we'll always be understanding.
---
While we prefer our raiders to be prepared with enchants and consumables, you won't be punished for not
---
bringing them 100% of the time. We understand sometimes not enough time can be committed outside 
---
raid. So know when that happens you'll still be welcome. We have guild enchanters and alchemists to help 
---
if you need it.
---
Experience is not necessary, whatever your knowledge, your guildies and officers will be here to help you.
---
**Currently Recruiting**
---
We are currently accepting members of all classes, as the final raid roster will consist of those with us at 60,
---
though we are especially looking for ranged DPS currently. Socials are always welcome!
---
If you are interested or have any questions, join our Discord and we'll be happy to help!
---

The original arena is STV you peasant.
---
&gt;Even if this is real, you have no idea how much it hurts to put that down your...
---
I know exactly how it feels actually.
---
Honestly, I feel like this may open up a bit more of a pathway for them to notice what made classic so well  loved, and hopefully use this to better retail.
---
Of course we won't have any idea on that until the next xpac... But here's to hoping, right?
---
(Happy cake day though!)
---
It was mainly mana management back in old WoW with addition of deciding if use lower level heal with some cast time but less mana consume or hots (if your class had them) on other members of party than tank.
---
Ill be a mage

The second step it is telling me from level 1 is to destroy my Hearthstone. I don't know if I can trust this guide.

I'd have to look into the possibility of exporting the addon's data.

Not enough diabetes. You’ll need 2 boxes of white castles sliders, 4 packs of beef jerky, 12 packs of instant ramen, 6 packs of hot pockets, 3 boxes of cookies and some mt dew to wash it all down.

Amen

Sadly, I don't think that's very far from the truth.
---
*Life on the outside ain't what it used to be*

Certainly you can; my first 60 was a Holy Priest, didn't even take Spirit Tap. You don't need to do that to heal, though.

“2 hour queue? Ok, I’ll wait”
---
Vs
---
“6 hour queue? Screw that, I’m rolling on one of the new servers!”

I doubt he's going for R14 if he's asking questions that are this simple.
---
We are not at peak wow time. You are comparing total, monthly and daily stats. Stop doing mathematics you suck.
---
What was implied is that wow classic will be more popular than ffiv. Its possible. We will see. You are acting like a fan boy.
---
The logical answer is that they can get a more accurate prediction of launch queues (everyone will be subbed and ready for launch by then). Then if they need to they can pump out even more servers before launch.
---
Same here, my partner actually prefers the "monster" races so I lucked out also.
---
I've been working overtime to take this week off. I was behind. Lol

I'm sure there is something out there.

Almost right. Just need to change the wallpapers to Alliance and the leds blue
---
&gt;But that’s like.... weeks worth of junk food.
---
Normal people shouldnt even eat that much junk in a year
---
I just noticed that bullshitery. This must be some sort of mistake. Blizzard can't be THAT MUCH RETARDED.
---
Mage or Warrior are your best bets if you intend to find raid spots, or an easy time finding dungeon groups. - (surveys are suggesting a small overabundance on healers - but all healing classes will be wanted for dungeons. Even Druids appear to be correctly underpopulated for raid/BG distribution.)
---
The rest of Europe likes beer you can taste most of the time.
---
Not decided yet, we'll decide in the last hour.

Nah this could be a new beginning for many people.

This is a difficult thing to explain, mainly because there are many,many reasons why. Also, I believe it has a lot to do with taste and how one digests their experiences in game. So, in short, I believe you need to take what people say with a grain of salt and be open to experience it for yourself.
---
However, it is my opinion that, in vanilla, the experience of playing the game is a much better time because the game itself doesn’t hold your hand. For the most part, the effort you put into exploring the world and spending time interacting with it, the more rewarding it can feel. The game isn’t going to always tell you where to go and what to do.  Most everyone knows about the infamous west fall chicken, for example; fun anecdotes like this are scattered all over the game world and it’s up to you to discover them on your own; often times you hear a rumor about things and go off to seek it out on your own. This game is as much about discovery and adventure as it is getting with your pals and raiding.
---
So in closing, I would again say that the reasoning is complex and please heed my advice and enjoy this game. Do not rush to the end of classic. Enjoy it for it’s entirety, I promise you won’t regret it.
---
Had. Past tense. Wow doesn t have have 11 millions subs right now. Half would be great.
---
&gt;Are people aware that Dire Maul and ZG were both intended as catch-up dungeons? 
---
Yes, we've been playing the game for 14 years so it's pretty clear, thanks. The fact that there are already some catchup dungeons and quests isn't an argument to add more though. We also know for a fact that going overboard with catchups is one of the exact pitfalls WotLK fell into and it massively impacted the endgame of that very lackluster expansion.
---
Thank god for that!
---
I've previously levelled on PvP and PvE servers and I found the PvP to be more enjoyable.
---
Yes sometimes it was bad and I'd jump on an alt but I remember have some really good 1v1 battles levelling up bumping into the same people and developing a rivalry with them. 
---
I'll be rolling on a PvP server.
---
I'm pretty jealous of this kinda setup just cause it's cool to play next to someone like that
---
You can do just fine without a dedicated deep talent spec.  
---
I stayed in a feral/resto hybrid spec and tank/healed in dungeons and some flag running in WSG.
---
Dedicated raid groups will probably have you go ‘all in’ if you’re into that scene.
---
Having a paladin or shadow priest will be super handy in your dungeon runs given the big cool down on your only rez.
---
You made the right choice.
---
Man I just had a flashback.  The nostalgia is real.
---
RELEASE THE HOUNDS!!!!!!!
---

---
Decided to look it up in pitch notes.   In 1.9 it changed from fire damage to shadow damage.   I didn’t remember when it changed.    Makes a big difference in molten core if it’s fire.

Inspired by the Mortal Kombat movie theme and excited for the WoW Classic launch. See you in Azeroth!

"Funny"
---
Do uldaman for stoneslayer (better for arms sword spec this weapon WILL last you till 60) or rockpounder also a great weapon the crit is a nice bonus at the level
---
Why not both? They said the hard work to make tbc is already done for classic.
---
Bad.
---
why what?
---
I too find that setting my wallpaper as the Horde logo reminds me of the hatred I have for their scummery.

IMO it was too great a jump. Health at 60 on my mage was like 5-6k and at 70 it was like 20k in greens.

Basically making these numbers up but it was a big jump.

except it's always a very slow, very one-sided war of attrition. at least with boss rush it's sort of balanced

I wanted to make a night elf but play with my dwarven friends so I ran all the way from Darnassus to Iron Forge as level 1, dying maybe 20 times on the way. Was so not worth it.
---
Or that time when I ran an undead priest to Mulgore so I could get a kodo mount faster, only to realise there was no priest trainer in the while zone because taurens couldn't be priests.
---
I don’t think it’s impossible to keep those elements while redesigning Retail to be more in line with Classic. It doesn’t have to be perfect, after all. All Blizzard really has to do is give classes their niches back (and new ones for new classes) and do away with daily activities, and they’ve got a good start.
---
From there, they could add extra rewards for not using the LFD system, limit LFR’s rewards to exclusively transmog gear and battle pets, and I think they’ll have a solid start to a Classic-inspired Retail.
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Nerd life!
---
Right after I made that post I googled it and saw, now just to wait for Netflix to get it 😢
---
I was happy to move to it then, but now I don't want it to happen. Classic was peak wow to me.
---
The only risk is not having a class trainer (Depends on what class you are and what their faction has trainers for) and the possibility of needing to go back at level 10 depending on your class for your class quest
---
are you talking about the writing? have you never seen a girl’s writing?
---
The linen is an item of HUGE importance not only because people want bags but every priest will need about 80 to get their first wand. Add to that the people who want to quickly level first aid(yes they do exist)/tailoring/enchanting and you can see why humanoid mobs at launch will be the most contested. A lot of people will be leveling skinning for the passive gold but it wont be too much of a priority for most people.
---
I think they should take the oldschool runescape route - involve the community and vote for changes, this will keep the game classic but with possibilities of expanding! (Not an expansion, but content through patches)
---
Hi, I never did food prepping like this - how exactly do you store those meals? Just in a refrigerator? Freeze it? :)

That's hilarious, one of the best scenes in cinema too. I feel like Tom Sizemore was born with a lump of chew in his cheek.

See the trick was to keep the game updated. You bought it (and the expansions) so you only had to patch, right? Even at slow speeds, it only ended up being a few hours IIRC.

oh geez, I have decided for a class but now I cant decide if I want to go Orc, Troll or Tauren Shaman - will mostly be playing PvP, with the occasional raid I guess, so... at first I was deadset on Tauren, but I have no idea if the larger hitbox is going to be an issue, for either solo runs (think you have the same hitbox even in ghost wolf form) or pvp later on as i‘d play ele/resto.
---
Now I am pretty much set on Orc, although only 1 racial benefits me, which is only really good for pvp (and some pve encounters) - whereas Troll would serve both worlds, although to have to deop HP to get the most out of Berserk, I dont know...
---
Tauren would be perfect, Herb Skill, more HP, cool looking shaman sets,  and the warstomp!

Just not too much of it.

F for me. Actually, I'm still waiting for an SSD to install classic on it and load the game in 10s, it will drop at my workplace Wednesday, so I guess double F. Also, F for the pour souls that think 5 hour ques will be ok. I hope I am wrong, I hope everything will be great, but I doubt it.
---
I played horde initially. Have players both over the years. I'll be playing alliance this go around from the beginning. My opinion? Do both. Create a horde on one server and alliance on another. Also, pick a high population server. I've played on low pop servers and it's terrible not having people to play with. Some people enjoy the quiet. I did not. So go high to full lol. Just expect queue times.
---
Love the hoard misspelling but at least she tried.  My wife dies not understand at all and would likely burn down my computer if I binged. 😔
---
&gt;maintain the general vanilla design principals (except classic class balance and the debuff cap, those can fuck right off).
---
So keep the design principles except the ones you don't like, those get changed, but definitely keep the rest the exact same unless you come up with more things you don't like about it then change those too?
---
Play both friend. Do Horde first, enjoy it and then make an ALT on Alliance side and enjoy that too! Enjoy the entire game to the fullest.
---
I wouldn't do DM before Level18.

They should go to wrath and stop there, imo.

Pet's weren't cosmetic back then, they were $$$$$$$$$$$
---
the only thing that really applies here is leatherworking mats because people will be producing far, far, far more hides at launch than any other time so the market should be pretty well flooded down to "barely above vendor level" silver prices, and people wanting to level LW are relatively low compared to engineering. So youve got low demand, high supply --&gt; incredibly low prices.

This is exactly why I decided to roll shaman. I played alliance(gnome warrior) in vanilla and was always terrified of this tauren warrior/shaman combo on our server that would take on 5 alliance easily. The warrior just 1 shot anyone in cloth with a WF proc. Since I am going casual I figure I can just duct tape myself to a much better geared warrior and heal/buff him while running around kiting.
---
Will probably do that. It might take a bit to feel at home in alliance but it will probably work out

---
Literally every class/race combination will be perfectly viable. MinMaxing is just an elitist thing for ultimate competitive push raids in 2005. I played Classic a lot since then on private servers and guess what? Elemental Shaman main :D It works... It works... Of course Damagemeters (if used) will be topped by warrior/rogue, but there is not much you can do about it. So yeah, you CAN and WILL clear MC-ZG-AQ etc. as a ret paladin, you can farm and pvp with it. Maybe you won't get a raidspot in the Tier 1 guild on your continent, but even that isn't impossible for Dwarven Retri Paladins and Tauren Elemental Shamans :D
---
Just do you and enjoy yourselves. Most part of Classic is outside of raids and there is no unviable choice there.
---
They’re dropping 4 servers NA and 4 EU I believe. In NA it’s 2 of each type, split between east and West. 
---
Also, not all are Full, as far as I’m aware. There’s a good amount that are High, which will still mean queues, but not as bad. Plus, as long as you avoid Herod and Faerlina, you will have a better launch day than them. 
---
But check on their website for when the servers get released. I think it’s like 1PM EST?

Right like I remember being the best, checking wow web stats and being better than the nihilum/death and taxes guys or whoever was relevant at the time worldwide for like a year. This means I have an ego. Everyone else more so remembers everything before the best and just falling off zg and getting eaten by packs or pulling a core hound or whatever. That zapped the ego pretty quickly.

Imagine being on someone else’s tablet and being bald.
---
They are fine. Ret paladin is a strong duelist, you just have the disadvantage, that many opponents can easily disengage, if they see, they are losing. Warriors on the other hand are quite bad duelists.
---
In group pvp a ret is a more versatile, but less powerful warrior. You don't have the reliable burst a warrior has and you also don't have gap closers, but you can support your team with blessings and you pack a punch, when you are close to the enemy. In general, a warrior is more useful in organized pvp.
---
You also have much more build versatility, as holy reckoning, ret reckoning and deep ret are very different specs in terms of playstyle and speciality, wheras warrior pvp usually amounts to charging in and hitting people hoping to get healed.
---
I'd recommend dwarf though, if you plan to go full pvp, it's the better pvp race, though human is much better for pve raiding as a ret.
---
Honestly league itself is genuinely such a fun game. The player base is absolutely putrid.
---
They’re pretty good at 1v1s because they can outlast people and drag the fight out. Everything else.. not really.

I dedicate my first classic bong hit to you then, you boomer.  
---
Took 3 month leave from college for classic
---
Seems like you have your life in check. I’m gonna let wow ruin me, not really though I don’t have an addictive personality. I am goin to binge wow for a few days though
---
I double-clicked to my phone screen unconsciously.
---
It shows which version it's for on the Twitch app? I had no idea. Thank you!
---
Yup, threat/dps meter was essential for raids
---
Why have an epic warchief leader when you could have an 8 year old as king?
---
LET MY GNOME FREE!!
---
Good wife.
---
Now reward her with a Tinder account so that she can have fun too!
---
Of course! I love leveling with a warrior because I know how hard you guys have it. We were thinking of rolling on the 3rd-4th highest pop server. No commitments yet but open to anything.
---
I was gonna say the funny thing is those spikes would actually, literally kill someone. - imagine the cops showing up asking for the self defense weapon you used. "Sure, here you go!" &gt;.&lt;
---
The classic census infographic that someone made based on about 10k responses noted that there was only going to be about half the miners needed to meet supply. Mining would be an excellent choice to just sell the ore.
---
Yeah it's bigger than a lot of people realize and has a lot of scorpid spawns
---
The forum thing - if true might be an oversight. I'm sure blizzard will allow Classic-only players to post on the forums.
---
As do I.
---
i am with you there - i hope for us both when it comes to being an altoholic. godspeed.

Paladins in vanilla are not nearly as smooth and streamlined like they became in tbc/vanilla and onward. Retadins have to seal swap a lot, and generally have a high game IQ/situational awareness to succeed in pvp situations. You have access to pretty powerful heals with a small mana pool as ret, but learning to be a hybrid dps stun machine can be rewarding. Reckbombing is very strong.
---
But yeah, it's not optimal in pve situations. Can it be done? Sure, as long as the people you raid with don't care.
---
Right now would be the best time to level a warrior with a flood of people in every zone to group with.
---
I thought this was cute and was planning to not attack druids either, until I read that last sentence... War it is then.
---
Skip getting riposte so early and get those 5% hit instead. Think it just as a 5% more damage done overall. Riposte isn't that good investment early, and sinister strike spam will do just fine.
---
If I were to level rogue I'd use this build up to level 53:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/0250231-0230552100020150221
---
Id honestly say that only maybe 25% do progression raiding? Maybe even less. 
---
People underestimate how many players in wow are just casual dungeon crawlers. 
---
As much as i think the LFR is 'bad', its the only thing that got casual players doing raids.

We are going to launch TBC and then what? When this conversation inevitably comes back around, what is the solution for TBC? TBC+? WotLK? We gonna eventually do WoD and BoA also? What's the point?
---
No long term thinking, and a *critical* misunderstanding of Classic+ is an issue here. So what if Kara and EN showed up eventually? They can be readded or remade for Classic+, which is a good thing for this specific community which really doesn't like much from mid-WotLK forward.
---
No, I can't do it in concrete terms, perhaps core design was a poor choice of words because it's entirely possible they didn't have a design philosophy that led to Classic it just accidentally turned out the way it did.
---
You could absolutely implement corridor style dungeons in Classic but after seeing peoples appreciation of the Classic dungeon style I would hope they would try to replicate it. Heroics were time-gated content as well as daily quests both of which were in TBC.
---
As for Sunwell from what I remember it didn't actually work out like the War Effort even though that is what was intended, to jog my memory I went looking for a concrete answers and I found a lot of quotes like this -
---
"i believe the original plan was for the dailies to effect the opening of the gates. However, in the spirit of worldwide competition, blizz decided to make all gates open at once at set intervals, irrelevant of the dailies, because some servers will take much longer than others.".
---
If you have evidence to the contrary I'd love to hear it.
---
I'll be in the camp that takes a few months to hit 60, and I guess my biggest fear is that I'll miss out on an entire phase of raiding because it'll take so long. I know Classic WoW doesn't invalidate tiers like retail does, but I still feel like I should rush so that I can see MC.
---
No it's not. There is no job. It's a game, and I intend to have fun whatever way I want. If that entails helping out the occasional noob, then so be it. If it entails ignoring someone's plea for help in favour of corpse camping the piece of shit that ganked my alt, then that's what I'll do.
---
Usually I always do enchanting with it, but I think I'll do skinning this time. A couple of the recipes require some leather, so I'll have it on hand, and can just vendor the rest for a bit of much needed money (instead of disenchanting all greens and losing all of that money on top of not selling anything, vendor or AH).
---
The movie fucks over alot of later storylines (Khadgar, Garona, Arthas, Kel'thuzad, Medivh, Ogrim, Durotan, the Frostwolves, and the fall of stormwind.) But yeah baby Thrall floats on the ocean from the Black Morass all the way to Hillsbrad many years before he was born.

Wholesome sad.

You think you're getting into the server ?
---
I quit before BC then returned during WoD and played for about a year then unsubbed again.  The game just didn't give me that same feeling.  I'm back for Classic and I'm sure it'll be a blast.  Have fun!
---
Just seems like a pretty big assumption. I eat relatively healthy. Don't cut out all sugar or anything but you don't have to. I run distance, I lift weights, and I play multiple sports.
---
And yet I have candy, mountain dew, pizza, cookies, beer, etc etc all sitting at home waiting for me to enjoy during my time off work this week.

Drive safe, especially since other drivers might attempt to rush home for the same reason :)

Solace | Incendius | Horde | Semi-Hardcore | Community First, Always.
---
- Mature Community
---
- New &amp; Old Player Friendly
---
- PvP Oriented
---
Solace is a Community First guild that places an intrinsic value on its people. Many of us have full time jobs and families, but we strive to be an efficient, organized group that never loses sight of the community and friendships that make Classic special. We will always help our own, and never treat people like meat to fill a raid group. People come to us to find Solace.
---
Raids are anticipated to begin in November/December. They will have a 10-15 minute break partway through. Weekends are reserved for World PvP and Premades. 
---
We're not playing classic to raid 20 hours a week, we're playing classic to world PvP and have a sense of community again. We will raid for roughly 8 hours a week, but when we do raid we strive to be as efficient with everyone's time as possible. We don't want to waste our time, and we don't want to waste yours.
---
We're looking for community oriented people with a serious mindset that want to get in on something that’s just a little bit different. There are no cliques here, no previous guilds, and no group of real life friends that have been gaming together since the third grade - It’s just us, and we’re going to have a good time doing things our own way.
---
Raid Information:
---
- Thursday &amp; Friday

- 9PM-1AM EST (6PM-10PM PST)

&gt;It doesn't take away from the community aspect. What is so social about the sentence "LF2M Deadmines need tank/healer"?
---
&gt;Nothing. 
---
Yes it does, it creates a community which is separate from everyone looking for a group in chat channels. It forces you to download an addon, which isn't very new player friendly.
---
That's life bro.

You have this now doesnt mean you'll have it tomorrow

So cherish it now.

Warlock is just a shadowbolt bot in raid content, though, and mages are considerably more than just frostbolt bots outside of raids much like warlocks.

I'm looking forward to shouts of "GAINZZZ!" instead of typing "Ding" with every level up 🏋🏿‍♂️

I get the same message on my PC, which was brand new in 2018. Game still plays fine, however.
---
Or maybe the new raids drop tier gear for off specs instead of direct upgrades?
---
There's apparently an xbox controller addon that works in bfa, not sure if it will in classic. If it does I'll probably check it out, that + couch is the ultimate chill leveling experience
---
I'm not sure I am following, but I'd like to understand. My plan was to active rapid fire after aimed shot fires so that Aimed shot does not affect any of the duration from RF. Is that what you are saying is wrong?
---
That last sentence is what I like to hear.
---
I hear ya. I had my TV set up similar but I found it would strain my neck too much. So now it's behind my monitor and offset a bit so all I gotta do is move my eyes a hair.

 Well game breaking addons there are very few. I can't think of any except the LFG addon which Blizzard apparently broke with latest patch. Also it seems the retail addon TradeSkillMaster is coming to classic. I have no experience with retail but after checking out some youtube clips that addons seems way to powerful compared to the normal auction addons.
---
 Back in the day I used every addon I could find that was useful. Same on private server. Ran like 30 or something last private server. A couple I find very important:
---
a gathering addon to remember nodes on the minimap
---
questie
---
vendorprice ( so you can see when picking quest rewards which one is worth the most money for selling, annoying to have to check on classicDB or something instead of having an addon)
---
Soulsort ( a new addon made for classic, enables you to set a limit to how many soul shards you create)
---
I simply refuted your article because you misused it and were disingenuous with the interpretation of the data. It's clickbait. The actual take away is that people who tend to sit for more prolonged hours often tend to make life choices that lower life expectancy. 
---
Sitting is not a known carcinogen, so if you simply made a mistake  it is my deed to inform you it made no sense contextually to cite that link.
---
Noice
---
That would be a huge help honestly
---
I have heard from so many people how great the story is in expansions.. but god I just dont have it in me to level all that way
---
Taken during beta test
---
Good thing you blacked out those names. Don’t want anyone stealing your account.
---
Yeah thats pretty bad haha... at least we get 4 new servers today.
---
Sweden. Okey I will check it out, thank you!
---
Its better that everyone is on an even playing field and has to earn everything, when you can buy gold, level ups, ect it ruins the experience for everyone. Blizzard should seriously take a good long look at retail and do something about it. I might give it a shot if they had special hardcore servers with all the bloatware removed from the game and some system that allowed all the zones in the world to be populated like a mega server.
---
I think it might matter more now on classic tho - they are very defensive about it.
---
the entire rule is fucking stupid tho. since RPers arent supposed to know eachothers names in the first place. they should just turn nameplates off or continue to pretend not to see the name just like they do for eachother.
---
Mctobi and millasa are a couple:)
---
Mograine will have quite a lot
---
Why not have Classic servers and TBC servers?  They could allow you to clone your classic character and port it over to TBC.  That way you can enjoy TBC content with all your hard work from Classic, but if you ever feel as though you made a grave mistake you could always log back on to your original Classic character.
---
Yes. More modern

I started just months after BC launched. I met a Draenei Shaman (Max level) while I was questing through Kharanos, he was just collecting some low tier herbs for the AH when he saw me getting mobbed by enemies, so rather than kill them he healed me up and had me kill them. I thanked him profusely because I was too poor to afford my repair bill. 
---
He opened the trade window, gave me 5 gold and struck up a conversation with me where he gave me some tips (I was a hunter) eventually he invited me to his guild and we started talking everyday. 
---
Well eventually I found out we live in the same area... and his son was in my grade. Que us meeting up after exstensive convincing from my parents and having them personally talk to my Shammy. We became best friends, nothing has changed about that, infact we're room mates right now. We still play WoW together from time to time but we have been so hyped for classic, the atmosphere in our house is just too exciting, we both took time off for release.
---
I've heard people say they're logging in hours before launch, and I've heard others say you get booted after 30 mins regardless.
---
I'm just wondering if it even matters. Do you really think Blizzard's servers are queing people up now? 
---
I'm sure we'll know tomorrow if it was worth sitting at the character screen for hours and occassionally clicking on different characters.
---
can you edit in a brick wall in front of patrick and spongebob that says "8 hour queue" please?
---
The ol' double conctraction! You got me!
---
The better question is why not?
---
Yeah goldshires pretty hardcore
---
&gt; it creates a community which is separate from everyone looking for a group in chat channels   
---
This is the same as a friends list or a Guild.
---
I get why they want to play it safe, but holy shit announcing only 3 PvP East servers at the start was a huuuge mistake.
---
The "grind" for me is basically cosmetics, mounts, things like that.
---
Damn i was so excited for this addon, but yea id be in the same boat haha

@1:58 he says that 84% of the playerbase for a typical server would have to ***"quit"*** the game before layering can be addressed, but that's simply not true. Layering is mostly a thing when an enormous amount of people flood a *specific zone* and make the game unplayable there.  Layering isn't meant to address the issues of just a high population playing on the realm, but rather to mitigate all of the stress on individual zones with extremely high traffic. We ***know*** exactly where that stress is going to occur, so layering is really the only realistic solution here.  Here are some important points to keep in mind about the population:
---
• This is going to be launch day/week/month.  The ***active*** population will be at a record high during this time.
---
• Everyone will start at level 1, so most of this enormous population will be condensed in low-level zones for a while.
---
• Once people start to level, they will disperse, spreading the system stress over a greater number of zones.
---
• Once the day/week/month 1 excitement dies down, people will settle into more normal playing schedules, meaning less of the population will be online and active at any given time
---
We know the time and place where the bulk of the server stress will be taking place, and it's perfectly reasonable to say that this stress will only last as long as it takes for people to start characters, begin leveling and disperse among all of the neighboring zones.
---
Oh, and the thing about Activision and microtransactions?  Yeah, it's a scumbag move, but what in the shuddering fuck does that have to do with WoW: Classic?  Seems like a strawman argument to me.
---
UK does not do coalitions as English is the dominant language on English servers.

Roll whatever you like you will most likely be alright.

The story is that there was some piece of terrain that tended to knock only tauren into the lava. I don't remember anything about them having to go clear through BRD to get in, only that they had to be extra careful. It was only true at the *very* beginning (like January 2005). Metzen had this changed to suit him because he was playing Tauren. The source on this is John Staats' book.
---
Why are you playing on a PvP world? The only difference is PvP servers have world PvP and tons of ganking.   Just know a PvP server means getting killed a lot as you try to level.

I haven't trusted blizzard for years. They told us we didn't want classic and that we thought we did. The only reason why we are getting classic is PR from the nostalrious mess. I'm sure the team is great but the pony tail hair guy makes the calls.

damn these sound so simple but so fucking good

now that's a self-righteous paladin if i ever seen one lol, well done.

I'm currently playing through Borderlands: The Pre Sequel again. I think I'll wait a few days before firing up WoW and hopefully avoid the worst rush on the low-level zones.
---
I have all the time in the world to enjoy the game, and I don't see why I should compete with everyone else over bear asses.
---
You can only be on that screen for 30 minutes before you go back to the login menu
---
I believe for a few weeks it will even beat retail and certainly FF14, but very likely not in the long run
---
Of course you can, you just have to scroll past all the RealID names to find the people you added on your server :).
---
This addon just adds a new tab, does not remove anything from the original friend interface :).

The army is full of idiots

I m or a couple people online would like it please reply
---
I can commiserate, my friend.  When WoW came out, I was in high school.  I lived with my parents out in the boonies, and we only got 28k internet.  Additionally, we only had a single phone line, so playing any online game for any extended amount of time was absolutely not feasible.  I had to just listen to all the stories my friends had to tell about their adventures in Azeroth and dream about what it must be like, which really sucked as a huge fan of Warcraft 1, 2, and 3.
---
It wasn't until college, shortly before the launch of TBC, that I finally got to play the game.  In a way, this re-launch is the fulfillment of a 15 year old loose end for me.
---
I just hate that im going to have to switch servers and most likely lose the names i got. Oh well.
---
Taking the easy way out... sure you are but who cares play how you want. I've always played PvP realms, I love coming in hot and providing anti-gank for lowbies in the guild or people just questing randomly. If you don't care for World PvP and don't want to be ganked or gank others there's no reason to even play on a PvP server.
---
You’re correct it’s a modified 7.3 API.
---
I won't promise! I got to 27 on the beta before they shutdown the servers.

That's wrong. Sitting doesn't increase the chance of getting cancer. That'd be stupid. Instead, people who sit also make other life choices that are also unhealthy. So it was really stupid of you to link it,and disingenuous to infer sitting has a link to cancer. Context matters and the context killed any hope you had. Learn how to interpret studies and find valuable sources. Preferably before you get to college.

Thanks for the response.

It costs gold to respec, but it's not something you do everyday or even every week as it gets expensive quick. 
---
Mages are the top tier caster class and always welcomed. All healers are viable. There is just more demand for priests and paladins.
---
By end game I'll assume raiding. This is done with your guild who will have a set raiding schedule (usually 2-3 times a week for 2-4 hours)
---
God I really hope you are not serious...

If so

Classic Wow didn't have achievements until WotLk

JAB has already eaten crow on this. 
---
Guy also stood up at Blizzcon and said "you think you do and you do," when he announced Classic. 
---
You're allowed to feel vindicated, but I'm so sick of people circlejerking this one phrase, when even the guy that said it admitted he was wrong and came around on the project, nearly two years ago at this point.
---
LFG itself is not a problem in retail. It's the teleportation and removal of PUG community that's the problem. LFG is just a red herring.

If trade chat automatically joined people together in a group and teleported you to a dungeon, which you be arguing for the removal of trade chat?

Absolutely true, in hindsight. I believe their rationale at the time was to let players decked in epics have the same-ish sense of progressions while levelling as the normal scrubs. That proved to be controversial, to say the least.
---
I watched it last night on hulu and noticed as well..
---
Hunter omegalul
---
There's also bonebiter at 34, however that is alliance only.
---
They are ok, probably below average. Holy paladins are absolute top tier though, which is part of the problem.
---
Well played they can be decent. Do you time vision and run set the enemy, or do you look around and dispel your team on the way? You aren't a warrior, you are a paladin, and too many play like warriors.
---
Imagine having a job and living beings that you have to feed or they will die! It's awful truly awful
---
The GM’s I’ve played with have been a warrior, a hunter, and a bear Druid. Hunter was the best guild/raid leader but the tanks were pretty good. 
---
Most of these questions you’re just gonna have to play to find out for yourself. Your first character isn’t going to be perfect, especially when you’re asking these questions day before launch instead of googling to find them out yourself.

the downfall of Band of Brothers, essentially overnight 5 whole regions went sov-dead and were claimable.  Best part is, the player who did it used the meta-game and used in-game mechanics to get it done.

this wont work in classic, was nerfed by blizz by 1.12

I’m going with a Druid. I want to play a healer. I’ve already played a Shaman. Paladin healing has been described as boring. Priests sound appealing but I’m worried I’ll be to squishy for a PVP world. So I’m going with Druid. 
---
I am conflicted because I’ve heard that priests can be good in PVP, but I’m going to be a holy priest so I don’t think I’ll do well.

Nothing you do will keep the 30m timer extended. Don’t waste your time. Log in 25m before the game launches.

This argument applied to retail means no one is socializing in retail which is fairly true, but that’s because it is the meta and norm

“wtf, I sacrificed my unborn son and now I’m stuck in a 40k que?”

I actually do greatly prefer first person view. It's one of the things that keep me from getting more immersed in WoW.

Is that a hunter weapon?

Damn thats awesome

I like using Mobinfo2 because it lets me keep track of the drops and other info related to the enemies I fight. I want to get into bagmaking and need to farm cloth? I can see what mobs have the highest drop chance of the cloth I need just by mousing over them. I can even see what mobs I got what greens and blues from.
---
&gt;Hey everyone, 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I'm looking forward to trying Warcraft Classic. Here is a brief background of my history: I did play WoW when it was first released for about half a year or maybe a little less. I never actually played most of the expansions, but came back here and there. I never got to do a lot of stuff in the game end wise. I also have about 15 years in FF11, so most of my MMORPG experience is from that. 
---
&gt;I was hoping you guys could just answer a few questions for me:
---
&gt;1. Is it possible to "respec" your class later on in classic mode?
---
Yes. Visit your class trainer in a capital city to respec. First time is 1g (I think), then 5g, then 5 more every time you respec after that up to 50g. If you don't respec for a while, the cost slowly goes back down.
---
&gt;2. I like playing healer and mage classes (like FF11), are they decent in Warcraft Classic? Would I be helpful to people?  
---
Yes, healers are always valuable in raids and dungeons. Mages also provide useful utility, such as food/water, Arcane Intellect buff, and portals around the world.
---
&gt;3. How exactly did end game stuff work like raids? In FF11 (vanilla and above) you normally had to wait two to three hours unless you were a very specific class, in order to set up something viable and do end game content. I don't actually mind the waiting since I'm used to it back then in that game, was just curious if that's how it worked in WoW.   
---
Raids are 40-person affairs. So you'll need to get 39 other people together at the same time to raid. There is no dungeon/raid queue so you will need to get 40 people together by hand. That is why guilds are so valuable.
---
&gt;4. Are there any particular websites that you would suggest for someone that's basically new to the game again, but has good information to read?
---
One of the best resources is [WoWhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/). It lists every quest in the game, every item that drops from every enemy, and walkthroughs on each raid and dungeon. It also has leveling guides, profession guides, maps, talent calculators, just about anything you could ever need.
---
I see this a lot but it’s kind of silly. People don’t spend 100% of their time in the game and the people who use reddit don’t suddenly abandon it when a game they like is out. They spend time on the subreddit talking about the thing they like. And lots of people still do that for bfa! Obviously a lot of people like it, and that’s fine. But enjoying it doesn’t mean that there aren’t real issues for other people or that everyone who dislikes it is a hater. I want very, very much to enjoy bfa and I keep trying to and I just can’t.

leaving work at exactly 3:00 PST and will get home at 3:25. I'll be okay?

Rather eat a queue now if it means a well populated, stable community down the road.
---
It'd be much worse if Blizzard over extended to alleviate a short term issue only to have those communities potentially suffer from lower populations once things settle from spreading players too thin especially on pve servers which already appear to have extremely tilted factions.

13 years for me.  Retail is.. completely un-understandable.  I cannot imagine playing this game.  Like 100s if not 1000s of UI elements in different panes.  Skills totally different.  Its a nightmare.
---
My understanding is ping in WoW can be as low as 35ms, but spell batching is 150ms.  I may be wrong here; but ping below 150ms is only helpful with loading the game world around you (traveling, seeing mobs, grass, etc.) While ping above 150ms will affect combat interactions.

I was a tank late in vanilla and I don't want to do it again, its a one of the biggest forms of boring. even healer is much better in raid. but nothing can compete with a good dps challenge fight for the top3 place in raid
---
I haven’t actually tried it as I don’t eat steak/beef or red meats. However I will probably try to make it soon with potatoes, chicken, or imitation beef as it sounds delicious. I will keep you posted.
---
It seems like a lot of these people that rank classes have never played druid and makes them seem bad. Fine with me, but it makes druid gear less contested. However, I'd raise Dungeons to 8/10. We can do any role for 99% of the dungeons and many times being able to switch to tank or healer has saved the party and kept us from an agonizing long wait.
---
For fun... Well if you rate them 5/10, you've not played one past 20, or possibly even past level 10.
---
Guess it depends on your job.  For some one hour of billable time would more than pay for a 6 month sub.  For a McDonald’s employee it might take 2 hours to pay for a month’s subscription.  For an unemployed slob that has time to make gold in retail to pay for Classic their welfare checks aren’t broken down hourly so they don’t even know the value of their time.
---
While your casting Holy Light on yourself, just think of all the poor Warriors who are sitting in the middle of the field healing up with bandaids and food.
---
It's hard to remember which add-ons I used, but there are a few that pop out. I'll probably grab more add-ons later just for QOL but right now I can only think of:
---
\[Bagnon\]([https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4459-Bagnon.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4459-Bagnon.html)) - Opens all bags in a single window with inventory sorted by rarity and has a search function.
---
\[Atlas\]([https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info3896-Atlas.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info3896-Atlas.html)) - Good ol' Atlas. Provides a detailed map of zones/dungeons along with notes on where quest-givers/bosses/certain objects are.
---
\[MonkeyQuest\]([https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/monkeyquest-classic/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/monkeyquest-classic/)) - Loved this addon in vanilla. Hovering over quests gives you info like the summary with words highlighted such as the zone or name of NPC/mob. As well as a lot of small quest-related QOL changes. I would use this over Questie if you're going for a more authentic feel. I'm like you though, totally indifferent to the whole #nochanges deal.
---
\[SellJunk\]([https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/selljunk/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/selljunk/)) - Nuff said :P
---
\[TomTom\]([https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/selljunk/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/selljunk/)) - Still the go-to addon for navigation/coordinates in the base game. I'll be using this along with thottbot(wowhead with the theme enabled lol) if I get stuck on any quests like finding that damn Defias Messenger.
---
Hulu subscription for your secondary monitor.

The only only only reason Classic is happening is because of those places. If you think anything else you are delusional. You can't rewrite history.

My wife dropped me in it at a family event yesterday. Her parents and brother in-law asked what I was doing with my week off and before I could open my mouth to lie about how I was going to be doing something really cool and manly, my wife says 'World of warcraft!'.... At first I was a tiny bit embarrassed but honestly, I get to play classic soon so I really dont give a fuck lol.
---
Do you think i'd have told you my master plan if you had a chance of stopping it?
---
I don't understand how that is smarter than transfers, it seems like WAY more work.
---
The simplest and best thing to do is say "The BC pre-patch is coming in X weeks, and servers A-G are going TBC while servers H-K are staying Classic. Transfers between those servers are free until the pre-patch drops". You could also make Classic =&gt; BC transfers free going forward as well.
---
Your proposal results in a lot of ghost Classic servers as newBC players switch to spending most of their time on the BC servers, meaning folks probably transfer to combine into a few populated Classic servers anyhow.
---
I see someone has been watching the new mindhunters season!
---
I think mage and priest only have class quests that give gear. Paladin has a quest to get Redemption and Sense Undead.
---
Tfw you complain about reposts but post shit tier low effort memes.
---
TBC was the best expansion, i had just as much fun during TBC as i did in vanilla. With that being said i would love if blizzard keeps basic Classic Servers, then creates Classic+ and TBC seperate.
---
You'll be pleasantly surprised how many solo players there are like yourself that form groups via general and trade channels on a very frequent basis.

\*\*&lt;Black Shield&gt;\*\*
---
Hello! Black Shield is looking for members of any class/race for Classic. We're a mixture of first time players and veterans who are looking to enjoy everything the game has to offer starting with the leveling experience. 
---
\*\*What to expect:\*\*
---
A skilled, well organized and knowledgeable group that doesn't take themselves too seriously. We don’t plan on chasing realm firsts, but we will be raiding and participating in PVP often. We hope to build a strong, active community with our own events and generally just have fun and go on adventures. 
---
While the plan is to casually level, once we start dinging 60 raiding will be semi-hardcore and focus on progression. Raid times are to be TBD, but the tentative times would be 8-11pm EST Tuesday + Wednesday. Raid Loot System is still TBD. No mandatory raids or guild events. 
---
\*\*What we expect:\*\*
---
At the the start we just want people to be active and have fun! We're looking for players at any level or commitment. We will gladly help any and everyone. From the first timer to the veteran.
---
If this sounds like the type of guild that interests you or if you have any questions about us. Feel free to join us in our discord server. [https://discord.gg/UMnuKmh](https://discord.gg/UMnuKmh)

If you’re just talking small gifts, food that doesn’t require much prep or long cooking times is always helpful. Maybe a few packs of his preferred drink that he can keep close to his PC. Or anything that aids in his comfort while he’s spending hours in this massive world of a game.

Also check out gear.blizzard.com/us/game/world-of-warcraft for some WoW related gifts. Just avoid anything that says ‘Battle for Azeroth’ on it.

Shaman is the least played class in classic. It wouldn't be horribly challenging but leveling is a little dull as enh shaman. At level cap expect to heal. Some people go Ele/resto and can get away with it in a guild but most guilds will want you full resto for the mana tide totem.

Future shadow priest looking for a pvp or pve guild to clear content and enjoy the game with. I'm a 25 year old ex hardcore raid and guild leader who understands what it takes to manage and lead a guild and raid. I've leveled a hunter and warrior to 60 on two seperate fresh private server launches and I'm looking to hit 60 by this Sunday.
---
I'm looking for a DKP system guild who is mostly mature, stable, and consistent. I would prefer it if the guild leader was the main tank or at least the main tank is in 2nd command and for the main tank to have known the GM and officers for a good amount of time. I'm not trying to help gear a rando main tank only for them to leave for someone else mid phase. 
---
I know that shadow priests are not the most desirable dps specs for a raid which is why I understand that there are some items in the game that I will never see. I have no problem passing on over powered must have spell casting gear to the mages/locks. I will however have a problem if I can't use my DKP on casual epics.

Thanks for reading!

A lot of said people will realize you can't just thunderclap and spam revenge to hold aggro.
---
Then there won't be more people trying to tank
---
Eh, ret still really isn't a stellar PvP spec. If you're going to PvP, you're either flag carrying at prot or healing.
---
This did not go the way I originally thought! Take my upvote. In college, I binge played and failed out because of it, but also I played during the vanilla to BC transition so everything was new...including flying.
---
LF cute healer waifu!!
---
I am guessing healers and tanks will be more prominent this time around. With people having less time to play overall playing a class in need is what a lot of people will do. The problem with a tank is that you generally are a leader or the group so the casual ones will possibly shy away from that role for that reason. So it may balance out but we will see.
---
&gt;  servers A-G are going TBC while servers H-K are staying Classic  
---
Oh man, that is *way* worse.  I'm pretty sure OP was implying that they would open BC servers and then players would optionally be able to transfer to them for free.  That's bad, but your idea is totally unreasonable because everyone has a million name collisions.  
---
Forking might work, and I'm not convinced that your concern about splitting the playerbase is any more real from the concerns that would arise from adding newBC to the game at all.  Whereas the transfer one definitely would screw things up.  The transfer, after all, is irrevocable- any fork based method still leaves your old characters available as they were.

Loot council with people who have been doing it since the beginning. Of course it won't work for everyone, but tried and true methods can't be beat for us.
---
Ah alright.
---
That would be news to me. But in that case, would character creation work? Just opening it up and exiting to stay logged on I mean.
---
Yea, complete pugging might be rough. The coordinating guilds already have loot methods determined for early runs though, so no issues there.

Better eat your Wheaties and down a few shots. Its gonna be a massive shit show for the first week.
---
Back in the days I would ha e a decent damage kit for my rest Druid for mats grinding. Works well enough. Enough to make you gold to buy potions for raiding.
---
Back in the day it was common to have a pretty big latency even if you didn't live far from the servers. So the game is made to work well even with a pretty high ping.
---
BUT, it is still the case that lower ping is always an advantage so I would generally recommend going with the closest servers. If your good friends are playing on NA though that probably matters more to you.
---
Is there a source for that?
---
I'm in a guild that uses loot council and I have yet to hear of a better method of distributing loot.
---
I can relate to this. I used to drink monster energy on the daily (2-3 cans most days). That shit was NOT good for me at all. 
---
I used to save them all and build a monster energy wall. By the time I was 16 I had roughly 500 cans stacked in a giant wall. I only knew this due to counting them before we moved house and I can tel you that the wall was only about 1/3 of the cans I’d ever bought.
---
Come to think of it I had probably spent around £1500 ish pounds on monster over 3 years of drinking it.
---
Sorry for the rant but this brought back some pretty costly memories haha
---
Absolutely, yes.

I just resubbed and it went through with no issues.  As others have said make sure you disable your adblock, or try a different browser.

Primordial is a progression raiding and world PVP guild. The core team team is a bunch of WoW vets who have been playing this game for too damn long. We've run successful raiding guilds throughout every expansion. Most of us are in our 30s. Our goal as a guild is to clear all the raid content as it unlocks and murder KT, all while killing alliance in the world and in BGs.

We're looking for mature raiders who want to kick ass while being social and having fun. We're usually sharing stories over coms and having drinks while we play.
---
Need a couple hunters, mages and healing priests. Backups of any role/spec are also welcome!
---
**Raiding Schedule**
---
**Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sundays 6:30 PM PST - 9:30 PM PST**
---
This is our planned raiding schedule. It's subject to a little wiggle room depending on majority of players schedules. Ideally we clear by the end of Thursday, but we've got Sunday for clean up or other activities.
---
**Loot Policy**
---
Our aim with the raiding loot policy is to always be fair, and to improve the overall raid and guild. By using loot council, we will ensure that given gear has the largest impact the on the success of raid and guild. The loot council bases the decisions on factors like: individual contribution, largest upgrade, role priority and attendance.
---
Loot council is a tried and true loot policy that works best for progression raiding guilds, as we've successfully used it before in cutting edge content.

Ah ein Hexer. Sehr schön !
---
LOL!!!!!!! JAJAJAJAJAJ +10

I have today off, but the game doesn't launch here until 11pm. I have to get up for work at 6am. If I'm lucky I'll do a quest or two before I need to sleep.
---
Naw. I might check out a new expansion if it looks good but Im done with BfA.
---
That’s not true, my computer is barely running it because of the shadows, but I guess I’ll play like old times

The people rally for retail WoW to die are the worst type of human being.
---
1. Let people enjoy things.
---
2. Competition is a good thing for every party involved. It forces companies to adapt or perish.
---
3. People who say this have a SERIOUS hateboner for Blizzard and/or Activision. But in that rage, they barely think about the players who enjoy the game. Take a step back and find out why hoping/wishing for millions of players to not enjoy playing retail would make you happy.
---
4. If retail WoW dies, Classic will be turned to so it can produce WoW's revenue. Enjoy the cash shop.
---
I'm not even going to get into the argument of how a 14-year-old game can beat the juggernaut of MMOs that still, to this day, has the most subscribers of the genre. If you seriously think this is the case I know I am physically incapable of changing your mind.
---
-Someone who will be enjoying the hell of out Classic, not jerking it whenever Blizzard stock goes down.
---
There won't be layering in phase 2. It's not even an option. They need to have it turned off to prevent layer hopping for world boss kills. Also, for AQ opening.
---
Those hot dogs need to be in the fridge, and those hot pockets need to be in the trash.
---
Classic: I'm about to finish this dudes whole career!
---
The only worry is, if indeed Classic WoW will far surpass retail in numbers, how Activision will look at it. I can almost guarantee that if it's going to be a stable success (and not just an inital hype of a week and then everyone is gone again) that they're just gonna try push whatever microtransaction or sale they can get in. I know they said #nochanges but when bobby kotick gets his grubby hands on something, you better watch out.
---
SAY SHE NEVER BEEN
---
Hey don't shoot the messenger. Tell it to literally every guide or pro warrior on streams etc.
---
I am not based in ks. But I got it from drinktrade.com which is like a loot box for coffee.
---
I've tried twice to get into that game and both times I gave up before 60. The face that they still don't have a great way to get to the waking sands is infuriating.
---
See? Retail is awesome

Yeah same here. It will be cool seeing all the pre-cata zones again, but I'm excited to experience some of the systems classic had that were removed in TBC and beyond.
---
He is correct. You will be booted after 30 mins, regardless of activity.
---
Me too :D
---
or maybe it does.
---
100% there will be footage but they will most likely never release anything to the public.
---
Well, unless they make it available in korea/china, yeah. Am I wrong?
---
Will Scholomance require a key to access again?
---
My thoughts exactly.  They were also my thoughts when WoW first released.  I love to PvP and played the hell out of Dark Age of Cameloot because of the PvP.  But ganking people while they level and 5v1s and shit is not fun to me in the slightest.  I really don't get WoW's PvP servers.  But to each his own I guess.
---
Everyone in line for a bloodbath. What server?
---
its gonna be hella slow unless you're 100% playing dungeons with buddies
---
Shhh, i'm trying to make the guy feel better about playing the inferior race.
---
Ok don't get carried away
---
Same
---
Blizzard made me change my name from “Poobubble” because it was offensive in classic
---
Majority of time you will want to have a shield on when tanking. 
---
If you're doing 5 man dungeon and outgear the instance by a little bit you may be able to get away with 2 hand tanking without much problems. It will allow you to take more damage ( = more rage) and deal more damage. That's all fine as long as you're not in danger of dying.
---
You will be able to tank all 5 man dungeons using Arms or Fury spec, no need to do protection until you're doing Raid level tanking.
---
It’s recommended that you meet together at level 10-15. Safety buffer for the run to Ironforge. However, if they wish to try their luck at level 1, go for it.
---
This is going to piss off a lot of people. I've heard plenty of times that new/returning players will be subbing the day of. I'm sure returning players won't have the issue but the new players/accounts will be upset.
---
Not the main difference, but a fair bit I would say. There have been other issues - like the /sit macro which would enrage warriors and others. But yeah, there was, at first, a lot of circlejerk about how vanilla was harder which quickly fell apart when Blizz confirmed it was not.
---
As a rogue player anyone that buffs me I always send back a /hug or /kiss.
---
I am super envious of all you folks that have such a large amount of playtime that sustenance is a factor. No sarcasm at all. I wish I could play so long that my body goes into starvation mode. Ah the good ol days.
---
It’s the true vanilla experience, no one knows what they’re doing.
---
I don't understand your point? Its quoted out of order as well
---
What the fuck are you talking about
---
That's a common falsehood, people are still very active in the social environment in retail. Our group has added a ton of friends even with the lfg tool. You don't have people spamming trade, because people use group finder for pugs, which still isn't a fully automatic tool.
---
he will have to go back to nelf area for hunter pet quest
---
AYE! I will see you in line my friend!
---
I'm thinking about doing Dun Morogh &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Wetlands &gt; Aralhi Highlands &gt; Tanaris &gt; Un'Guro 
---
...then what? 
---
I am also thinking about just going through the Human zones as I know them pretty well and I feel nostalgic about Westfall.
---
I'll be thrilled to be wrong haha
---
As it stands, I expect to get plenty of chores done in between login attempts today :)
---
That is one Thexy Text.
---
There was a blue post saying to expect queues on medium. Just until people spread from starting zone for that though. Even high servers will have decent queues most likely.
---
If you insert a butt plug... then no need for diapers right?  It just keeps it all inside your body yeah?
---
Because there's zero difference between locking people out of something and like-minded communities congregating
---
I'm thinking of waiting at least a week. Don't have the time or patience to wait in a queue. Then again I'm just a casual player, so doesn't really matter how late I start.
---
If you happen to do any arts and crafts stuff, a WoW themed little trinket would probably make him really happy.
---
Tank LFG 5g downpayment
---
Don't worry, Asmongold and Sodapoppin will be 60 by the time us normal working adults make it out of the starter zone.
---
I've actually never played classic, I did play back in BC but I was way too young to enjoy the game, the farthest I got was typically early  Westfall or the equivalent for other races, and if the stress test is a decent representation of what the game will be like, I'm down for it,  I want the generally higher difficulty, grinding, having to group up, all that. But I'm 100% not quitting BFA either. I want a classic experience but I also very much enjoy the current wow formula as well, but is one objectively better? No. Both are good enough games for their own reasons.
---
Does he need to purchase the actual retail game, or just need to pay the $15 sub?
---
1. Where are these screenshots saved? How do we configure save path?
---
2. Can we include the current character name as part of the file name?
---
Both factions are full of people in 20s and 30s.
---
YouTube Ebbnflo compares Resto, Feral Cat, Feral Bear, and Balance builds while leveling. Viability is Feral Cat then Bear, then Resto, and then a bit farther behind is Balance.
---
I will never talk crap about another person in my life if this is true
---
Sorry, just the name reservation part. I heard it's open a lot earlier.
---
If you saw my bank you would see that I am both Horde and a hoarder.
---
One of the reasons I'm playing WoW. I'm tired of all the bickering in the real world. The only racism I wanna discuss is why Tauren keep getting depicted as dairy cows.
---
Dude that's perfect, thank you :D
---
What!? Nixxiom did this? He's playing on EU?!  My realm and opposite faction!?!? That vid is so dope !! STOP HYPING ME EVEN MORE!!!
---
I just let him die and try to stay out of combat.

We are a morning guild still accepting casuals and social members for our split raids.  Our raiding core is full at this time, but with a lengthy grind to 60 ahead of us, things will certainly change a bit.  Keep us in mind if you would like a morning home!

So, classic Wow only "requires" an Intel 4000 graphics processor. If your CPU is new enough you honestly shouldn't have too many problems, might just not be able to run it on high in a rapid for a week. But...let's be real, thats probably not going to be a problem anyway, eh?
---
Me and everyone in my group this morning. Already pulling wife aggro. Good times.
---
Any add-on with "-master" as its folder title should have the "-master" removed.
---
are you really gonna eat the cat?
---
I've never really gotten the problem people have with this UI. With every button keybound, why does it matter where your buttons are? I want mine as far to the edge of the screen as possible so I can see more of an uninterrupted view.  
---
If you use keybinds for literally every single spell, what advantages does a different UI design offer me? I've tried many throughout the years but I never like having a blob of shit in the middle of my screen.  
---
What am I not getting? Once you learn your key binds you literally never need to even see your skills, so whats the big deal that I am missing
---
That was obvious even when they released TBC.

"The Light" is actually a literal energy brought about by the Artist Formerly Known As Prince. Wut

but if its a boe everyone will be selling it so everyone needs
---
Oh you are so adorably naive.
---
a couple spriests were valuable in raids, not just as easy to get into as a mage but probably less competition than a mage
---
I watched with my wife last night and when Randy elbows the kid off the game I could have SWORN the kid let out a feeble "eeeyyyhhh" but it was dubbed over with a canned punch noise. I'm really curious about this now.
---

---
Speaking as someone in a medical program (vet school) they do. C = Doctor, c =\= a well prepared doctor though. Anything below 70% is failing though.

How would that work, blizzard deleting all your items or your entire character? That would feel horrible and shit on all the casual players.

Been planning on a lock myself, great fun and fear spam just cracks me up.. 
---
Couple hours before launch and I’m torn between lock and holy pally..
---
Incidentally also a ridiculously cool word.
---
*Archon*.
---
Of course I'm biased from playing StarCraft and stuff.
---
Sorry, I added a picture.  The multiple files of the same type, should I consolidate them or leave them.
---
Why is that?!
---
Happy bday fellow 26th Aug guy
---
Fair enough, this having no bearing on classic though as it won’t have any 2.0 changes. It’s clear that shaman gear won’t drop in alliance raids in classic.
---
You mean when i go to work at 245 pm? 
---
I’m staying where I am. You’ll have to take this queue position from my cold, dead hands.
---
When do these new realms open up? Can't find blue post.
---
Will probably end up moving to new realm unless the queues aren't too bad.
---
Maybe he's thinking of another time zone. D:
---
They call people who don't get married/have kids, but simply focus on hobbies they enjoy, loosers in their 20s. In my 30s I envy those people harder than I ever thought it was possible to envy.

Find your own happiness, people. What's important is who you yourself want to be.
---
More like 3:30pm. You ain't gonna get that far so quickly. ;)

Four in NA two pvp two pve
---
I got a 3 day ban from Blizzard after about 2 weeks into the original launch back in 04 due to my name. I've registered the same name that got me banned back in the day for classic launch today. /rolldice
---
Sweet jesus man, you truly are insane. I mean, this is the real deal!
---
I mean don't get me wrong, I salute you dude, I was one of the original subs to your stream during the beta test... But man, I'm worried you're not going to be enjoying this amazing game. Still, I gotta admire your conviction, I'll give you that.
---
I will note that leveling as Resto adds no benefits versus Feral, but does kill slower. Feral can still heal dungeons while leveling. I've done it twice.
---
You ever thought that maybe you should make up your own mind instead of letting a bunch of people you don't know tell you to do exactly what they do without any thought whatsoever?
---
See you on Pyrewood! I hope horde?
---
Great job, you've probably already posted this in /r/battlestations I'm guessing.
---
I've literally been back and forth between the 2 classes for the past week with a "final decision" twice. Yet, here I am. I love both PvP and PvE, probably PvP the slight edge, but PvE gets me to where I want to be PvP wise. The thing that holds me up on both classes:
---
Hunter: Pets seem to be a slight annoyance, but I think it might be part of the charm(?) Farming for brokentooth will probably be a nightmare. Biggest concern is raiding dps as it scales past MC, will I be skilled enough to continue to be competitive in raids that might only take 2 hunters.
---
Lock: seems like an overall great class. Unsure on how it performs in raids but seems amazing for group utility, healthstones, orbs, summons. Really really not sure about farming the shards before any Dungeon/raid/bg/duel, if I'm in org do I have to fly to winterspring everytime to go farm? I need a mob that gives exp to in order to get shards correct?
---
Any advice in helping push one way or another would be great
---
Since I'm older now I'm more interested in the lore, so I'm planning on reading as much as I can this time around.
---
I have no idea if this is true, but I want to believe so I upvoted
---
In a pug you pretty much need roll on everything because people are defacto-assholes.
---
You nailed it. I was 10 in vanilla so obviously didn’t get a full experience, but I want to get a BiS and just have that amazing feeling rather than “oh awesome maybe I can Titanforge something better but it’ll be gone in a few months anyways”
---
Ah, can’t help you there friendo
---
So yes, but also no.
---
Unless they actually do put in a lot of QOL improvements, the things that sucked the most about vanilla are going to be in the game, and that's mostly organizational.   A lot of people seem intent on shaming Blizzard into not allowing better organization so good luck with the raids.
---
After taking the photo, OP then proceeded to unplug and hide it back in the garage
---
Wasn't there a FP on the east coast of the Hinterlands by the end of vanilla? Side note: that slow, methodical crawl up Jintha'Alor is one of my fondest memories from vanilla. Having to wait until you were REALLY sure everything else was out of range before you pulled one, and if you died hoping to god that nothing had repopped around where you died while you were running back to your body. Good times!
---
I want this to be real
---
Too many friends on the realm I'm on. I'm sticking to the realm I picked, and hope others pick a new realm &amp; shorten the queue line.
---
You cool, mon.
---
Hahaha wow.   So when you said “a bland zone” when replying to someone talking about HFP it was actually talking about all of Outland?  That’s a funny way to speak.  Thanks for the win I guess, your argument seems to have broken down.
---
Arby's is literally the king of advertising. Look at what they did for Dragonball

They're Twitter is pretty cool.
---
Is this for real?
---
&gt; Private servers held a lot more people than traditional vanilla servers.
---
Private servers hold a lot less people than classic wow servers tho.
---
Can probably thank the multi-billion dollar corporation financing for that.
---
WTF are you going on about?
---
The CPU and 4GB RAM are just barely enough, but that AMD R5 GPU is about 2/3 as powerful as an Nvidia GT630 or Intel HD 4600. I mean, WoW Classic *will* run and you *should* get 30ish fps on reduced settings at like 720p or so, but is that really what you want?
---
Last time I looked at the list they were all full or high pop, I'll make a toon and try everything new. I know some people will give up or I can maybe pay for a transfer later.
---
Next level solution: Just run 5 dps. The enemy cant kill you if they are already dead.
---
If by key you mean jumping off the top over and over so you can die and rez on the other side of the door.
---
I think a drop-off is expected and there will be some realm-merging, but I also think the drop-off will be way less than Blizzard anticipates.
---
and bigoted.
---
You may have said west twice

Only way it could’ve been better would’ve been to splice in the end where they blast the bunker with the flamethrower

I quit fortnite to play
---
1. Should I play a PVP server as a casual player, I am more PVP focused then PVE?
---
2. Is it possible to raid once a week?
---
3. Do raiding guilds take on spare healers with limited play time (IRL)?
---
Thanks for the help! Happy launch day.
---
Omg. I’m gonna be 60 next Christmas then.
---
Yes. Which will go to executive bonuses and shareholder buybacks/dividends. Not to increased dev salaries or some dramatic increase in dev hiring.  In terms of development it means nothing both are under the same sub.
---
That still doesn't make sense.  Both Redridge and Duskwood are contested zones starting at level 15 and 20 respectively.  Tanaris is extremely far from being the first contested zone.
---
If only Dwarfs were horde :/

Planning to roll on Firemaw but getting scared of potentially huge queues cause of this poll. Did it really take over as the biggest server and will the queue be full or is it just bias because it's reddit what do you guys think?
---
You think you do but you don't
---
Stalagg is higher pop than Faerlina and Herod at this point.
---
Fuck.
---
Classis will sustain and actually thrive if they add new content in the same spirit.
---
You will find people to help you out, we all start at level one tonight so this is the best time to start besides 2004. It won't be like that on retail, ever. A lot of people will be jealous you get to experience classic for the first time, it's an amazing game.

Stuck between Mage, Warrior, Rogue, and Priest.
---
Mage ticks the most of my boxes, but I mained mage in vanilla. I'm not so keen on spamming frostbolt for pve as well. 
---
Tanking would make me enjoy pve more than dps and I love the idea of finding groups easier. Arms looks fun for pvp aswell. This would absolutely be my first pick... but solo play is important to me. I don't like the idea of having to rely on others. Also its the most populated class.
---
Priest. Healing would make me enjoy pve more than dps and I love the idea of finding groups easier. Solo play is important to me. I don't like the idea of having to rely on others which makes me nervous for pre-resilience pvp as a squishy. I want to be a pvp healer, but I don't want to just suck and die because rogues etc.
---
I'm looking at my first kid being right around the corner and hopefully the first job as well real soon. My goal is getting 4 hours every sunday with two buddies.
---
It's a solved equation, you can look up all the answers, and you guild can point you towards the best public data, and the guild private resources of information.
---
Just play, have fun, and the knowledge will come.
---
Only warning would be.. Don't worry so much about your First character. Odds are as you get into the game, and see more of it, you'll relize the class you picked isn't really like you thought it was.  So it's likely that you will reroll into something that fits your playstyle after you know more about the game.
---
If you've played other MMO's before, you should be fine. Be forewarned, though, that WoW Classic, when it first opens today (and for a while thereafter) is going to be ridiculously, hugely, massively crowded. Just in the stress test it was basically unplayable when the realms opened; there were no mobs to kill for the quests, no mobs anywhere nearby to kill to grind; it was a madhouse.
---
WoW, when it launched, was actually a lot more approachable and less "grindy" than other MMOs of the era (EverQuest, for example); it's far more grindy than modern MMOs are *now*, but that's what attracts people to it. I'd still say it's worth giving it a shot, though. I play modern WoW and am planning on also playing Classic; they're very different (modern is far less grindy and easier to pick up), but I'd almost recommend starting with Classic, if anything, and then trying modern to see what's different and see which one you like better.
---
Classic is obviously more traditional; trainers play more of a role (actually, in modern WoW they basically don't play any role at all anymore), the world is more dangerous, you walk everywhere. Modern is more streamlined and has quality-of-life changes, like more flight point transits, more transports between quest hubs, more linear questlines that are easier to follow. But try both!
---
Yeah i definitely wouldn't remote control desktop when i'm in game, i can see myself getting into some trouble for that. But if i'm just at the character page i should be okie.
---
First time in MMORPG history that some dude hit on a chick in game and actually got some out of it...

---
It's even blue for alliance
---
I prolly will, can't help myself. Just so damn annoying to get literally bullied and shamed (not like friendly banter) for being sick...
---
Probably would have been better for them to relase the new servers earlier...
---
From an old fat who was in college when WoW was released, good fucking luck graduating!
---
[Yes](https://giphy.com/gifs/jack-nicholson-nodding-anger-management-S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o)
---
It is quite a deep rabbit hole, they'll appreciate your setup.
---
The most common strategy is level as an arms warrior with 2h weapon, and keep a 1h and shield in your bags when you need to tank.
---
Should work. But you really should consider upgrading your ram in the future.
---
Classic+ could bring more BGs and maybe even arena. 
---
There’s also a bunch of scrubbed dungeons and raids they could add that never were.
---
I think Naxx will be enough for pve though, it’s not like many people actually were able to complete it.
---
&gt;It was nearly two years ago at this point.
---
Well sure it was two years since Classic was announced but let's not ignore that the circlejerk has been a thing since JAB answered that question. It only shit up because people "will prove him wrong".
---
I know a guy who sold a warrior on server E something for $900

Stuck between human and night elf for my warrior. Weapon skill is amazing for some phases, but NE has better attack animations and shadowmeld/wisp form can’t be reproduced through items.
---
Go classic. Mess around the starting zone, get a feel for the mechanics. If you struggle with questing, look up a vanilla wow database/classic wow database, plug in the quest you’re struggling with and that’ll help. Never buy any gear while leveling, unless you are melee and your weapon is extremely outdated. 
---
The game is easy to pick up, and then gets more complicated when you are trying to push the skill level through pvp or clearing dungeons/raids at a fast pace, but don’t worry about that, that is just optimization for content that people are familiar with. You will be good, ask questions if you are ever unsure about something. I highly suggest rolling a dps class to start so you don’t feel like people are depending on you in groups while you are getting familiar with the game.
---
Thats fair, there have been powerful moments of course, I agree 100%
---
But lets look at BFA for instance, oh hey its Garrosh from mists all over again, not to mention how they completely ruined certain "Powerful" characters, looking at Malfurion and Tyrande. The tree was burned and blizzard hasn't had those characters do anything of significance in recent expansions at all
---
Imagine streaming for money because his deadbeat broke-ass friend can’t afford a computer. Lol
---
Solution, axe the family and dump the career. You're home now.
---
Then they can't allow people LFG in trade chat to be reported for LFG instead of "trading". #NoDoubleStandards
---
I do plan on taking some breaks to make dinner and the like, just because I will need SOME breaks.  Just try to make sure that any time you spend away from WoW:C as a breather is quality time for/with her and hopefully you'll be good!
---
If not Zugg zugg your way all the way to the couch!
---
Very true, heck if I hit 20 tonight ill be amazed
---
It's a great sign!  We are getting the true launch experience :p
---
how you managed to survive cata  for over a month blows my mind
---
You can still binge WoW with a wife and career. The kid is where you messed up.
---
Im so jealous living the dream if you can lam with your buddies.
---
Needs more caffeine

---
Same. Although ill probably skim a lot of the more generic type quests. I can only read so much at a time.
---
Mostly a joke. The game has become more and more phased to the point where you basically are playing a single player game and almost never interact with other players.
---
My brother played like an addict. He was a skilled player and had a lot of friends. But he dead. A lot of people die too soon, and the more people you meet (which is easy to do online), the more people you'll experience die. WoW was a big social game. This whole week got me fucked up
---
Really? I thought combat rogues were the best PVE dps in the game
---
&gt;are you horde or alliance, cause the biggest thing about classic wow is you can have 16 debuffs on mobs now. which means paladins can actually tank
---
No, it doesn't. Paladins can only tank dungeons and that's true regardless of the debuff limit. They can't effectively tank raids for the most part because they don't have a taunt, not because of debuffs.
---
I personally believe that there will be plenty of tanks willing to do dungeons, this meme is more relevant to dead servers. I will be playing a priest myself, may the Light guide your way.
---
But then they tank
---
I watched Avengers Endgame again for the 5th time.
---
This is what you get for trying to reply "quick" while at work..
---
I would just say this much: Grades are the only thing you can really take from school for the rest of your life. My first two years of college were absolutely chock full of WoW, and my grades suffered. The smartest thing I ever did was quit when I went to my last two years of university because I was able to pull my grades up high enough to the point where I could go to law school where I could do something with my life (Note: in Canada, getting into law school is actually difficult, not like in America where you can pay to play).
---
Do not sacrifice your studies and grades for this game.
---
I once heard an amazing idea for how to fix this..... You can only mount your flying mount when at a flightmaster. This is to prevent people from vanish -&gt; mount pussying out. Also it allows people to navigate easier, because lets be honest, TBC map would be shit without flying.
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
damn, that's quite a big list. Please tell me you don't intend to use all those LOL
---
People that say druids are the worst at X never played druids. Druids do well in all rolls. When you get to Raids, you'll need to put in more work, but will still do well.
---
The servers release 10am PST. 1 PM est
---
Work out between flight points and you're set.
---
Ahhhh got ya. Good to know going forward in my tanking as bear haha.
---
Yup, better manage your time between resets farming those and other raid materials.
---
it's the mac's that is having problems with the gpu.
---
thats a little mean dont you think?
---
Bless me with your knowledge about exactly how many will drop off.
---
So I probably won't be able to play Classic on launch?
---
It’ll depend on your particular servers economy. It’s different on every server.
---
Per comments on the curse forge page, yes.
---
Why rush? Its the classic experience, you've got at least 3 or 4 hours to prepare at 3pm PDT hehehe.  I hope not though :D
---
I will not skip class but I will enjoy as much as I can without flunking. Merci.
---
You don't actually have to RP or have a RP name, as long as your name is mature nobody cares.
---
I don't have a RP name and I have never done RP. I've been on Argent Dawn for 3+ years so far without getting in trouble.
---
I don't think it's impossible to have family/kids and hobbies. People can balance, it just takes a bit more discipline.
---
It's like saying you can't work and play, or study and work.
---
No way?? Really?
---
some of the most casual classic players I know who havent played wow in years and aren't even big gamers all use this subreddit. I'd say over 50% easily
---
&gt; skipping classes, playing til Dawn, redbull and weed
---
Now that I'm in my 30s it's skipping work, playing til Dawn, redbull, and weef
---
hopper would never play a girl character, 1980s masculinity wouldn't allow it. he'd be either a human or an orc, and probably a warrior
---
I wasn't trying to be rude, I was just thinking that maybe there was a website or something since there weren't very many people in your discord. Didn't mean to your ego, but I agree that this would not be a good fit. Good luck to you as well.
---
get your ilvls outta here
---
Most classes use 1-3 abilities in their dps rotation. Raiding is a small proportion of the content though, so I wouldn’t worry about that too much.
---
I was the same. Choosed druid cause that movement speed yo, the jukes, the heals, THE DAMAGE
---
Thanks for posting this.  My number one concern with classic is that most people will say either "no changes" or "wait til after phase 6," when, as you probably agree... phase 6 is too late.  
---
It isn't just item levels though.  The stats on naxx gear are far more optimized than previous tiers too.

It’s obvious we are the more intelligent group....we picked a faction with undead being the closest thing to human....alliance has 3 human races basically...humans with the disease Vern troyer had (rest his soul!)  humans with dwarfism and just normal humans....who wants to be something you already are in real life anyways?!?
---
GET THE FUCK OVER YOURSELF AND PLAY A GOD DAMN  !!!!!
---
You know deep down what you want to play.
---
Darkshore sucks for leveling in, unless you really, *really* like grinding because you will constantly body pull bears and cats every time you're running to or from a quest spot.
---
isnt 1200W overkill?
---
I logged into my priest who they defaulted to Holy spec. You can ONLY use skills from your spec tree now and they've changed things a ton.

I plan on healing in PVP and PVE so it may be more personal preference

Moreso BC with Thunder/Deep Thunder. All of the weapons in vanilla are BoE from what I recall, so you can have another BS craft it for you (armor, too).

Me: CLASSIC opens today!!  I don't know when I'll talk to you again!  Azeroth needs another healer!  Years of waiting have come to fruition!
---
Girlfriend: Dork!
---
Conversation ends.
---
You can PvP in a raid healing spec and do really well. Not everyone in a BG should be pure DPS anyway.
---
WoW should only cost $15 a month, dont make it also cost $15000 a semester too.
---
In the game files should be a txt file, open it with word pad or something similar, change what you’re wanting to change and save.
---
What’s that?
---
Quality *shit* post
---
That's fair. It just depends on how often you plan to use it. Never on trash, only on some bosses, etc. If you are going hardcore with them, I'm sure you'd need plenty more. But at least it's an easy farm, and gnomes are delicious.

Dude, the first 4 months of babies lives is sleeping. They sleep so much you’ll have plenty of time. What I did my wife worked morning I worked nights, so I’d get done around 11 pm stay up till 3/4 am feed my son at 1 am and 4 am so she doesn’t have to wake up in the middle of the night then she left for work. Babies wake up eat goo goo gah gah for like 30 minutes and go back to sleep for 3 hours. It’s pretty awesome. Bmy dude is my life, excited for you man!

They knew the entire time!

**The Warsong Warband wants YOU!**
---
**Summary:** RP heavy Horde guild based on Grobbulus. Looking for members to grow the Warband and craft a close-knit community with to make new memories and stories together in the world of Azeroth.
---
**About Us:** The purpose of the Warband is to bring together players who are passionate about World of Warcraft and Role-playing. We're starting out as a small group of IRL Friends, but are eager to build up a close-knit, reliable community with those we meet along the way. We have a healthy mixture of newcomers and veterans to Vanilla and are in no way expecting you to be an expert. Our only expectation is that you enjoy your time with the Warband.
---
**Membership:** Anyone and everyone who is passionate about Classic WoW and Role-playing. Brand spankin’ new? 10 Year vet? Played Private Servers for years leading up to the launch of Classic? All a-okay.
---
**Goals:** Primarily interested in Role-play. We’re all adults and don’t expect you to ding 60 in an unhealthy amount of time. This isn’t a competitive, hardcore guild. We’re here to enjoy Classic, create memorable stories with one another, and (hopefully) make life-long friends with people who are looking for the same experience as us from Classic WoW.
---
**Raids &amp; Loot:** Raid times are To Be Determined. We’re adults and understand that life will inevitably get in the way of leisure, so 100% attendance is not expected. Loot will be handled by a council and a form of DKP and Effort Points. As we reach max level, the Guild leadership will get a concrete system in place to ensure everyone committing to end-game will have a fun, fair time.
---
**Contact Us:** Optimal way to get in touch would be through discord. My handle is **Feedback#4376**, or you can go ahead and join us on the guild server! [Warsong Warband Discord](https://discord.gg/7eN5J5u)
---
Pally os fine for dungeons, for raids go war
---
How it should be.
---
I wish my fiance would play, but she's not much of a gamer. Glad you guys have that!
---
Okay mom
---
Candy is slang for pussy.
---
Or its trippin over some of the middle letters being something like "dyk" being dyke. lol
---
Imagine most people in Vanilla didn't raid. And it started an industry-wide tidal wave. Leveling and the WORLD was actually that good. People like just playing.
---
and the minifridge
---
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in This Aint It Chieftain!
---
**&lt;This Aint It Chieftain&gt;** Horde US **Whitemane - PvP**
---
West coast guild looking for players who enjoy raiding, PvP and Dank memes. Our founders are original players from 2004, with numerous server firsts, mythic end game kills and prior guild leadership.
---
Raid Schedule and Times: **Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday - 830pm-1130pm PST**, With Friday/Saturday optional for ZG/AQ20 at the same time.
---
**Off Schedule Plans**: 45 Min Baron Runs, 20 Mans as interest persists, frequent trips to Tarren Mill/Southshore for World PvP, AV/WSG/AB Premades.
---
**Loot Distribution**: A combination of DKP + Loot Council. 
---
**Default drops** from bosses, such as Shadowstrike/Vendorstrike will use DKP. **Legendaries**, as well as **specific class items**, like the Eye of Divinity and Ancient Petrified Leaf, will use Loot Council. 
---
There will be weekly DKP drives for additional DKP, based on what materials for consumables the guild needs for the week (you should try to be self sufficient on your own, the guild will help in a pinch, but don’t make it a constant habit). 20 Man loot will not use DKP or Loot Council, without saying.
---
**Recruiting Needs**:
---
*Mage - Medium
---
Warrior - Low (Fury w/ Tank OS only)*

---
My initial point was never about peak subscribers but peak quality of the game itself. I never claimed it wasn't subjective.  
---
Using the subscriber timeline as a comparison I used it to argue that there's a correlation between quality of the game and subscriber growth (more people joining than quitting) and that the relative flatline of WotLK growth was an indication that the quality wasn't high enough to keep the playerbase growing.  
---
You're free to disagree with that but you should recognise that subscription number/number of players isn't the only way to judge the quality of a game, otherwise we'd all have to accept that fortnite is the peak of gaming.
---
I would like it
---
They are bringing up another PvP EST realm in an hour.
---
Nice... my alt is a rogue. There is a version for warlocks?
---
My plan is vendor the most expensive greens, send all others to a bank alt to DE later.
---
rogue gnomes can be a pain i the ass because of a small hitbox xd
---
How early can you log on to wait in character select screen?
---
The key thing with MC is having competent/geared tanks and healers. If you have 2 tanks and 3 healers that know what they are doing you can go pretty far with 30+ noobs. Just holding aggro and keeping the tank alive is what people struggle with early on. A bad tank or healers is when you get the wipe fest while they figure things out.
---
Just every once and a while grind up weapon skill on low xp mobs, ie safe to wail on ones.
---
This is the real answer.
---

---
&gt;but now the insufferable pserver community is going to do their very best to ruin it lol.
---
How exactly will they ruin the game? Because they've got more knowlege on it? They're no different than you and I, they just happened to play the classic patch longer. I fail to see how that's ruining anything.
---
Well it is tomorrow for me in eastern Europe. After the work day is over.
---
Cool, so you hate it because of personal preferences. Is it so wierd that there is a differing opinions out there?
---
Or just don't eat like a child.
---
If you are confused, just ask. You assumed, and you were wrong about your assumption. What a shocker.

Congrats on that strawman kill though, it didn't stand a chance.

That tends to be an uphill blink.

48-72 hours for his web hosting provider to migrate to a new server unless someone is able to help him.

---
Taunt that one every day, mocking blow even challenging shout if needed, hold the aggro mate, thats one hell of a loot
---
Best practice IMO is to suggest ahead of time for everyone to Need on blue BoE's.  That way no one is surprised, and no one has an opportunity to ninja something for cash.  People can greed if they really aren't interested.  
---
Yes, it would be nice if people could all greed on something they aren't going to immediately equip, but it's just asking for trouble with anything expensive (ie: someone Needs because they 'Need' the cash).  Better to remove the possibility for drama.
---
the only answer to this question is what you want to play. asking which class to play is completely subjective.
---
I didn't even make it to level 20 in modern FFXIV, is the endgame good? The design of the intro quests gave me the impression that it was a generic theme park MMO, and I already play WoW.
---
I really liked some of the ideas that were on display at the original (ill-fated) launch and I was hoping they would persist after the game got actual content, but that doesn't really seem to have been the case.
---
This was taken they day they opened realms for name reservation. It was about 4-5 min after launch time.
---
Dats wacist :o
---
Make sure you have proper lumbar support from now on because you probably wrecked your back lifting that monstrosity.
---
r14 is probably the worst grind in all of wow history, outside of 1% raid mount drops.
---
This is what I call a pro gamer move.
---
LA and Chicago I believe
---
Needs to be about 5 minutes longer to be a true anime intro
---
How awful is leveling? Id love to priest but holy seems a bit rough from what ive read.
---
It's not "messed up" if items rarely used at that stage of the game are selling for cheap but will cost more later in the game when they are commonly used
---
Four day weekend beginning on the 5th!
---
I got on during the stress test and did a few levels. It felt so fun to be back in there, but I didn't want to go crazy and put too many hours into it just because it would all be gone soon. 
---
Now it's here and that's fucking dope. I plan on taking my time and being thorough on the way through. I can't believe the game I'm most excited for in 2019 is 15 years old.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I really really want to play Legion again.
---
I eat healthy most every day and average about 13 miles of walking every day as a landscaper, I think I'll be ok. Plus I'd get sick if I ate this all at once.
---
I get off work an hour and a half after. Guess I'll be playing tomorrow.
---
I’ll hit 20 and probably get off.
---
&gt; or just to have something playing in the background?

Got a monster peach tea with my name on it, and a bottle of Bacardi Lime and a 2L of coke to go with it. I don’t want to get *drunk*, but you only launch a game you’ve been waiting for 10 years once, ima do it right!

To say I’m excited is an understatement. I’m a little apprehensive that even Skeram will have some 2-4 hour queues, but I’m gonna do everything in my power to get in early.

I agree and thanks for your post.
---
&gt; I wish I would've been a bit closer to my gaming friends when I was a Teenager
---
So true. I had online friends for as long as 5+ years as a kid/teen and just kind of stopped contacting them for no real reason, I was so dumb and didn't appreciate friendships. I still remember those people today and remember hundreds of things we did together. Lots of memories of playing Doom 3 coop with Kevin, and I haven't seen him in about 12 years now. I know his full name (it's not a common one) and could probably look him up to find him but man is that awkward.
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
My philosophy is that if a decision is too hard then the options are either too equal or there is not enough information to make a decision. Either way you just pick one and hope for the best.
---
As someone else who is going to be enjoying it, need I remind everyone that every "WoW-killer" has had a strong launch then died a slow death. Don't put the moniker on Classic, it's cursed.

It was like 1.7 they did it. There was still a huge durability difference between plate and cloth though
---
Where is this meme coming from?
---
Hope u get corpseganked for life bro
---
&gt; Arena is also a big reason for class homogenization, as similar classes are easier to balance.
---
If your personal preference is having all classes be pretty much the same, my opinion is that your opinion's pretty bad.
---
Can always make a macro and put it on your mouse wheel to cycle through them. Double gathering was never a problem in vanilla.
---
Set alarm and go to sleep idiot
---
You’re always better off getting some sleep over none of the goal is to stay awake later
---
You are correct.
---
Eh, "rape" is likely not on the list because there's something interfering with it when the word is split, either xxxr apexxx, xxxra pexxx, or xxxrap exxx.
---
It's one of the incredibly obvious ones that should never slip through, so I wouldn't doubt that there's a larger reason.
---
Or this dude is lying do make an issue out of "white" being censored, when in reality all the colors are censored.
---
lol dude i get the nostalgia but god damn are u also playing on a core 2 duo PC?

But also like,
---
Will a free trial give u access to the wow classic ? First time playing wow so i wanted to the "free trial" and see if its my thing.

Well you are now taller, better looking, and more well endowed

Have fun fighting the guy who has every piece of gear, flasks, all consumables, en epic mount, and 15 years of competitive PvP experience ranking in the top 1% who knows for a damn fact, that eng ain't going to save hardly anyone, rolling eng doesn't fix shit players...

See you soon, or unlikely you, just a whole bunch of people like you.

No matter how I looked at it, it kept appearing weak and feeble to me.  Then I realized it was because it was Alliance!  FOR THE HORDE!!!

Shit it’s the main reason I got a second screen lol
---
My friends and I basically decided to wait a week before deciding which server to play on. Too much chaos going on.
---
Should have been Carson Wentz but he got Hamstringed by a warrior and had to sit the rest of the season out
---
dumped my gf time to play classic all week
---
He's not answering your question about free trials, but he is correct about needing to buy the game and sub to keep playing. Don't be a dick on launch day!
---
To answer your question, there are no free trials for classic yet.
---
bro! you just posted cringe...

Hello and welcome to Months Behind
---
## Raid Recruitment and Times
---
Tuesday/Wednesday  
---
 9:30-12:30 EST
---
Recruiting ALL classes currently
---
Casuals and PvPers also welcome!
---
## Guild Philosophy
---
We’re looking for players and raiders that are dedicated, prepared  and will be able to perform to their level. Attendance is mandatory and  is taken into consideration for loot distributions.
---
The loot distribution system we will be using is loot council. We  will be having each class leader on a seat so that it is fair and  balanced. There will be many factors that go into account on loot  distribution including attendance, being prepared and your performance  in raids.
---
We’re currently looking for dependable people that knows their class  for officer positions to help in the guild. Also just looking for people  just looking to follow some strong leadership.
---
Join us if you’re looking to have a great time in classic and to down  content in a timely fashion. Our core will consist of just about anyone  that hits 60 in a timely fashion. We will be running all of classic so  get ready for the long haul.

&gt;Anyone who can tell me the key differences of raiding with Shamans instead of Paladins?
---
Horde have to watch their threat more closely.
---
Take a 3 hour nap or 6 hour nap, i think i read somewhere that sleeping in intervals of 3 completed rem cycles or something like that, or i could be talking out of my ass... don't quite remember
---
To be fair, "rape" actually shows up in a fair number of normal words.
---
I understand, I cleared my schedule with my work for the whole week for launch, but I get it’s hard to do.
---
An addon that enables people that want to do the same content to meet each other is somehow against the spirit of the game.
---
Most Classic/TLP servers are more popular and with more players than the current retail servers on EQ, and by far.
---
Damn I miss vanilla coke, I don't even drink soda anymore but I miss vanilla coke.
---
they will drop population just cuz people get tired of the queue
---
so u just gonna outlast them
---
I reserved three different classes and I plan to play all of them.
---
Yeah I know that. The news is just entertainment
---
Monster is my every day caffeine source and I poop just fine, thank you!
---
Yeah I'm talking about the endgame stuff and clearing the zones I was questing in at 110. I usually level up through dungeon runs and quest while in queue so I end up with a lot of uncleared zones when I hit cap in each xpac.
---
battle.net app &gt; world of warcraft &gt; "version" drop-down menu in at the bottom &gt; world of warcraft classic
---
questing 45–50 is way better!
---
I was Unabomber for about 6 months during vanilla, named after the power player at the time. He was a pretty good player and always wore hoodies, idk he was fun to watch in highschool.  
---
A friend of mine had Christpuncher, and his guild was The Christpunchers. That honestly lasted close to a year before it got the axe. I will miss the Thursday evening sermons in Ironforge.
---
10k isnt that bad tbh.
---
In other words Classic just yeeted Fortnite into the bushes?
---
Yeah same here but then I'll keep playing once I'm done with that
---
I think it's important to do that to an extent because really it's easy to either forget or just not know (oh yes I clearly remember my 24hr+ marathons) that a week of junk food (even just a few days of it) will result in an environmental disaster cleanup crew to show up at your house
---
Have fun, eat snacks, be happy, but beware the butt death

Did they accept donations?
---
There is no reason to believe Nostalrius wasn't at least partially for profit.
---
I played vanilla wow over a decade ago, and I just wanted to relive it for a bit.
---
I remember back in classic my 2 buddies were the worst for this. Every time a new server released they would make new characters and I had to follow them. I ended up with 4 lvl ~30 characters over 4 servers before I told them to screw off and just stayed on the last one. It was 4 months after release before I actually picked a server to stick with.
---
Polish is subjective in my opinion, what one person sees as polish another might see as simplifying or streamlining. As for the Sub count your suggestion makes sense if you assume no new players come into the game. People will be quitting all the time but for growth the amount of new players coming in will vastly outpace the amount quitting.
---
So a way to see this would be "in WotLK people quit at roughly the same pace as new ones subscribed".
---
I'm interested to see hear in which ways you think the game is more polished too, would you mind listing a few? Personally I played for the second half of Vanilla, TBC, the first half of WotLK and then the start of Cataclysm. So hearing about any new polish or polish you think happened in TBC/WotLK would be especially interesting.
---
I don't think I will.
---
i wish my orc had that hair now
---
Oh yeah, those have great energy, put them on my list.
---
Party On Wayne!

---
I'm going to make the prediction that even with layering you're going to be fighting for every tag in the starter zones....If you can even log in to begin with lol.
---
They really didn't. They have a ton of contingency plans in place for extra servers and such. It really isnt a big deal.
---
That cat is not big enough to last a weeks worth of meals.
---
i think everyone has that one silent badass in their guild.
---
This is horrific advice. College is the best time of your life don't spend it playing WoW. Quitting my freshman year was the best choice I ever made.
---
Gosh do I love the "working from home" *in quotes*.
---
Almost impossible to clear an entire week of work... Unless you scheduled an emergency in advance, haha.
---
Wow! This is a really good start! Keep working on it and soon you can upgrade your tailoring skill!
---
Abney Park, outer London. It’s in the title of the article I cross-posted.
---
People will just make fun of you and call you iegolas :)
---
No you're not. If this post is true, you're not upset. You're looking for people to tell you that it's no big deal that you gave up on those cats to play a video game. 
---
It's not a big deal, because someone more capable of making them happy will adopt them, but it's a shitty thing to do.
---
GitHub is the number 1 code repository in the whole world. Recently bought by Microsoft. It's about as legit as you can get.

By that data Skeram should be almost double the pop of Thalnos... Its still high pop and Thalnos is Full. Dont put too much stock in those numbers.

I'm not interested in your excuses. You were still rude. All these responses haven't done you any favours either.

You're a madman!

They have hunter and lock, they'll be fine.

Sold my Paladin for $1200 back in 2008 or 2009. I started working and wanted to get rid of the distraction. I regret it cause I put in a ton of time and work into it.

Rank 14 IRL is much more important tbh
---
I think DM has a two handed mace that's competitive but I can't remember what it's called.
---
Yeah, you don't want to level as a holy priest. Level as shadow/disc and make sure you get a wand and leveling a priest is really not that hard. Just respec to holy at the end.
---
Also once your gnome enters STV.
---
Here is the fix.
---
Go to twitch like normal. Choose World of Warcraft. When you go into it, there will be a drop down,  just like in the launcher, and then choose "Classic".
---
I'm starting to think that Classic is just an elaborate guerrilla marketing scheme for junk food companies.
---
But you were just a dick for no reason. Not worth
---
I would still probably be playing retail if BfA was good, Legion was solid but I don't know why they followed it up with such a pile of trash.

Is that a lady doctor?

---
lmao i wish dude
---
God the single life is envious.
---
Its a hunter :D
---
I'm rolling a taurean druid we should all meet up and quest together
---
It's worth mentioning though that TBC will 100% fail for the same reason TBC private servers always fail. 90% of everyone plays horde in TBC.
---
I just hope they show the faction balance
---
I care more about that now than queues
---
If i live in Arizona what time today does it unlock? 2?
---
Yea very excited! I’m sure they planned it.
---
It’s definitely rounding down. But also if you do a time zone conversion on a website you want to convert from 3pm PDT not PST
---
I named a Human Priest 'Imolestkids' and reported it like 10 years ago. They never added it to the filter because you can still make it today.
---
its not just 40 , you need that tiger riding for the winterspring tiger too. so yeah it is well worth it instead of paying 700gold in cloths
---

Yeah I've got some snack on hand just in case, really hoping I can handle it haha, first time trying an extended fast
---
WELCOME SKYPHE!
---
You guys are such pieces of shit
---
Chances are I’ll ignore my phone and it will die, or I’ll shut it off to avoid distractions for the first couple days lol
---
So your tactic is to move the goalposts when something you said gets proven wrong?  I like it, that way you can just call everyone a strawman and then never have to commit to anything you say.
---
Man, I used to work for Freeman and  was playing wow from the control booth for Microsoft, I fucked up and switched the inputs on the screens and for about 5 - 10 seconds my game was being displayed on all the Microsoft screens in a conference of probably 50k+ people.  I got my ass reemed out, I can't believe I did not get fired.
---
What exactly makes it worse than the sentient Native American cows he's standing next to?
---
Zyklon
---
looking 4 young ones? pretty weird...
---
Well then say "Facerape" gets through
---
&gt; It's probably based on regular expressions anyways.
---
The reason I assume that it just hunts for the word, is that names like "Working" and "Stacking" are caught by the filter. Pretty much any permutation of "King"
---
just a shame about all the plastic you cant just use tap water and a glass?

Great now I want Arby's
---
Lol you're being downvoted because you're being an elitist gatekeeper, not correct. Many players including myself that have been waiting years for Classic are going PvE, that doesn't make us "tourists and fornite kids" because we enjoy different aspects of the game than you.
---
I will be raiding a lot, but PvP is always my favorite. I get super competitive. So it’s been so long I don’t remember vanilla well. I played A holy paladin back in the day.
---
Lol. Take a few and look around. Like I said I actually prefer it over vent as I learn more and get use to it.
---
Yep. It was huge back then. People like to imagine thing got bigger in TBC and WotLK, which it did - but Vanilla still had a huge player base.
---
I agree with that. My apologies for the misunderstanding.
---
Here is a list, copy and pasted, of all the U.S. pvp realms:
---
Bigglesworth	PvP	Pacific
---
Blaumeux	PvP	Pacific
---
Faerlina	PvP	Eastern
---
Fairbanks	PvP	Pacific
---
Herod	PvP	Eastern
---
Incendius	PvP	Eastern
---
Skeram	PvP	Eastern
---
Stalagg	PvP	Pacific
---
Thalnos	PvP	Eastern
---
Whitemane	PvP	Pacific
---
I’m not off till 6 and it launches 5pm my time. Preparing to wait in the que all night
---
It goes both ways, and also depends on which private server we're talking about
---
Y'all are fucking MAD at retail lmao, over at r/wow people are just happy about Classic without shitting too much on retail.
---
I think i had gotten to 58-59 hours. Leveling goes smoothly until the mid teens
---
You know you can tilt a phone sideways to get a widescreen picture, right?
---
Instead of that new trash replace it with Elder Scrolls Online and that's me. 
---
WoW was never a "complete" game what with it being released before all the desired features could be added. Still, it's much more "complete" than Elder Scrolls Online ever was. 
---
I hope that game dies. Lessons need to be learned. You don't need to wildly deviate from ClassicbWoW's "theme park" formula to be successful noatter what trash rags like Game Informer or their equivalent nowdays say
---
Here's Joker's last bit before dinging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRyD2LfBZPQ
---
Burn it
---
Well, Blizzard themselfs has stated that players should avoid realms with "High"or "Full" population. All PvP servers available at the moment are either High or Full.
---
I think it's better to have a successful launch, rather than to hesitate to add more servers because they *might* have to delete them later on.
---
Your all nighter of staring at a log in screen together.
---
That's for classic to go live. He means at 1PM EST when the new servers go up.
---
You'll probably have to restart/relog. Doubt they'll just appear.
---
Yeah that's true. Plus, we have no idea how many people subbed to reserve a name or character. We could, and very likely are, in a minority here. We could be inundated with a mass of players at the 11th hour and the new servers won't be even close to accounting for the influx.
---
Only time will tell; but I expect, at best, an hour wait for my server (grob gang) tonight.

No one can help you choose. Its YOU who is gonna play the game.
---
Hey man, totally the same story for me! 3500 hours went into GW1 during those years and I don't regret it one bit. In a way I've sometimes felt sad I never got to experience WoW, since expansions have changed it so much. It's awesome that Classic will not only allow players to revisit the game, but new players like me and you to have that experience for the first time. :) I'm super excited!!
---
But the new 5 servers coming up(EU), will they be "grey" in realm list or will I have to update/restart the game.
---
But everyone told me the launch will be smooth and disconnect free? This can’t be true!
---
You can revert a marriage though
---
Kids are much harder to revert
---
So many people that play WoW have no idea how to eat properly.
---
I watched it like 5 times on the classichype stream
---
Except when you literally just stop going to class, studying, or showing up for exams because you'd rather play WoW.
---
You sound like a real baby snowflake here
---
Why your referring too are cheap idiots or kids that will be filtered out because three can’t afford a WoW sub anyways.
---
Yeah but, if my name is something lame like "Bartholomew" instead of "xDanktokerx" then people won't think I'm as cool when I gank questing lowbies, cannibalize their corpse and spam /fart.
---
Ive been really productive today. The more distracted I am, the faster the day goes by. Also going to be useless tomorrow at work
---
Does your friend have other work we could look at?  Instagram, maybe?
---
Grow up
---
I read somewhere about the reckoning-thingy, but also that it doesn't work in classic because the /sit-macro is broken? 
---
I really want to play a paladin, but I'm honestly so confused and scared I might just roll something else.
---
I would upvote, but I can see past the realism of war in that scene.
---
Undead Shadow Priest !
---
Wish it was that simple, a few friends are trying to play on the same realm
---
For now ...
---
I've never been more productive at work than today. I felt like it would be best to occupy myself pre- release. To speed things up!
---
I made sure I didn't have enough money to sub to make sure I don't crave. Well be watching whoever seems the most interesting.

too much wasting rep from darnassus area, you can learn spells in theramore if i am not wrong so some traveling but its well worth
---
I will say this, if you choose hunter make sure you train growl. My vanilla hunter experience was basically melee until level 50. It was my first mmorpg, and my only other experience at that time was a super Nintendo. Needless to say I died a lot lol.
---
Thank god. Marshmallow pies and Totino's earned your upvote by the way!
---

---
**Mograine** \*
---
Yeah but we all know he meant west so dont be that way...
---
It's a very good sign. These servers aren't full due to people playing. They are full due to character reserves. There is a difference.
---
To me, "first few years" is vanilla through wrath. Cata was the first major step backwards, fun as that expansion was at times, and they've stumbling back and forth ever since.
---
The fact that WoW Classic runs on a toaster now makes it easy to be into family and play the game a lot. Example: tomorrow I’ll be making the run from Org to TB on auto run while building legos with my son. Next week I’ll be doing my shaman water totem quest (aka running and running) while having a chat with my wife about her work day. Mobile WOw (around the house at least) will be huge compared to when I was just tied to my desktop back then.
---
that's the joke ding dong, he's saying retail sucks
---
Glad to hear you feel that way, thank you :)
---
Who makes a petition to get an HD remake of the ingame scenes of that episode?
---
Stay put and stay strong! We can do this!
---
2.5 days will not happen imo. Even the fastest speed runners can only manage in about 4 days.
---
Yikes
---
you are really giving private servers too much credit.
---
haha thays the beauty of taki g the whole day tomorrow. If tonight is a dud with queue we still have all of Tuesday! theres no way it can go tits up
---
Nice! I plan on doing a juice fast this week too. Your gonna feel so good after the first 48 :)
---
they don't like slavs to me.
---
Let me try to explain where I am coming from so maybe you understand the mentality of most Classic players that don't want this garbage in Classic.
---
Lets say for the sake of argument, Wrath was your favorite Xpac ever. You love it and have played it on Private servers. Lets say Blizzard announces that they are going to put out the Xpac and make it just like how it was. Or at least as close as they can get it.
---
Then all of a sudden, the Vanilla community starts saying how they want to implement addons that would ruin an aspect of Wrath that you loved. Something that was a great part of Wrath. The petty addon creator is going to continue to make this addon despite the very vocal Wrath community that doesn't want it.
---
Now you have arrived where we are. Sure, 5%-10% of the community wants it. You don't always get what you want.
---
Wrong auction house.
---
Welcome to the hype train. Vanilla was the pinnacle. It's good to be going home.
---
LuL nice Attitude man 
---
I dont want anyone to give me money or some shit 
---
I Just wanted to Tell that i cant start *AGAIN* On the das Classic launches
---
Not so exciting but I still game with my boys from 04. Never stopped even when we stopped playing wow, were all back for classic though.
---
Weve all met up numerous times throughout the years so theyre all much more than gaming buds.
---
Hello you, are you me? Cause this sounds like my life. Sorry for you friend
---
There will be a lot of priests made. There will be significantly less priests that make it to 60, put in the effort to gear for raids, and want to heal.
---
Oh yeah sorry I have seen this, he had zero competition which I expect most competition and fighting over mobs to really slow me down.
---
It’s only 45 min thanks though

Why the fuck would that matter? Classic wow will be like a new game, and all types of progress is possible.
---
That's what I've heard and someone else linked a blue post a while ago saying you can log right in once it goes live while sitting at the character screen. Like it'll just say enter world without having to relog.
---
Firemaw is an EU-realm, I don't know what's happening in the US. Firemaw became full yesterday, more than a day before the 4 new realms. One of those could have launched earlier, all I'm saying.
---
Currently in university N.Europe but practically you have lots of written assignments, but if you can write 5 pages a day with references, you will have a ton of free time.
---
I think it's highly highly dependent on the college/major. Not to bash the humanities but I think those folks can have much more time than engineering or pre-med people.
---
Mograine will be full in 10 minutes, you dont need to worry
---
That's at least false for the last past 7 days. I wouldn't be surprised it has surpassed Fortnite other times in the past.
---
Just drink 6 at once 4Head
---
the important thing is that we have hindsight, much like osrs did. osrs players knew what changes made the game worse in rs2/3, so they knew to vote no (and to tell others to vote no). plus, the osrs dev team are pretty good at polling things that aren't awful for the game, for the most part (they've had some bad polls, like one for effective mtx). 
---
i think that the same would happen with classic. for example, we wouldn't pass LFG because 1) everyone would know how that ended and hit no, and 2) the devs wouldn't even put that up on a poll because it's so obviously against the spirit of classic wow. i trust the classic devs to do it well, since they've been doing well this whole time.
---
Nope, spelled Horde wrong, dump now.
---
Couple things regarding class selection.   
---
For end game raids generally anything that has a heal is relegated to that role for 40 man dungeons. (Paladin, Shaman, Priest, Druid) 
---
For end game raids generally the viable tanks are (Warrior &gt; Druid)   
---
For pure dps, anything is viable .   
---
Generally speaking, if you play a warrior you'll be expected to tank the 5-man dungeons.   
---
I'd suggest picking a class fantasy and rolling with it. If you think Tauren look badass, my suggestion is Tauren Shaman. Since they are basically a cleric, mage and warrior all rolled into one.
---

There was a small stretch of time when the boats were broken and they replaced them with captain placeholder who could teleport you across the continents, it was only a very small stretch of time, but there was a lot of jokes that came from it.
---
How does this not take fun out of the game for anyone?
---
Your fault for assuming. Just go slow, you're easily confused. Like when you thought quoting myself was moving the goalposts. THAT level of confused.
---
"I see this as an absolute win!"

If you wanna quest to 60, you need to hit nearly all zones.

It is great victory indeed
---
Brilliant. For I too - will be doing this now.
---
You have just convinced me to take enchanting as my second profession because of this. I was originally going to be skinning/mining make money first and wait until 60 for enchanting.
---
No more.
---
What do people use 2 monitors for? I asked on another thread and people just mocked me. I’m genuinely curious.
---
Milkytits worked too!
---
Only if they release TBC, at which point TBC will be the balance changes.
---
You're comparing two different kinds of content. And managing soul shards is terrible. Warlocks or more or less similar to mages during raids.
---
You should explain also what to do once youve set everything up
---
That's rich considering you're the only kid here. Still whining like a child about something so trivial.
---
&gt; WoW was never more popular than it was during the first few years of its existence.
---
It was also a time where most of the people waxing nostalgic about it were 13 year olds who could game for 14 hours a day without problems. The gameplay philosophy will obviously keep a body of people invested, as well as attract some tourists, but most of those who act like classic will kill retail don't have nearly enough free time to play classic hardcore. Even playing classic in a casual way will take an immense amount of time to get anywhere, and as such all the now-parents and people working 50 hour weeks will likely drop out quickly one they realize the time sink the game is.
---
Night Elf Druid, obviously.
---
30 min idle timer I recon.

---
Go  18-6 with fasting and only 400 calories a day.
---
That makes sense, i remember 16 being the lowest for DM, 18 being ideal.
---
Maybe in a couple years after all the planned phases but not before then. At that point, there's a chance they'll either move on to TBC (at which point prot paladin becomes viable and ret paladin too as long as you're Horde), or start doing new content which could involve balance changes.
---
But above all else, play something that you enjoy. If you want to play ret paladin then do it, but be prepared to put in more work for mediocre dps if your goal is to raid.
---
I just got chicken and basmati rice, cut some potatoes and air fry them when I get home. You guys are so fancy
---
You're amateur hour, you need to step up your game.  Take a handful of Adderall and Modafinil.

can you link that desk?
---
Haha, I also get the clack bars on the character creation on my ultrawide. Looks amazing man!

---
You mean blow-me?
---
Mainly looking for experiences, stories from people that played these classes during Vanilla.
---
I agree the beginning of the BFA's story was contrived and recycled. But with the inclusion of N'zoth and if the leaks of what shadowlands is or could be i'm extremely excited. 8.2 I feel took the story in a much better direction other than the hey new powerful magic stuff lets fight over it.
---
 Fantastic man. I really appreciate you taking the time to be so helpful. Learned a lot from you. Tons to learn still but have somewhat of a basic grasp now I feel.
---
 Making your own macros and coming up with new ideas is just something that adds to the gameplay experience I think. 
---
 Thanks again.
---
Oh, I know that private servers often had shit way out of wack.  I know specifically which mob you're talking about, she was very difficult to kill and definitely was over tuned.
---
Other aspects of private servers are no doubt undertuned.  It's well known that mob armour and resistance values were completely made up and largely broken.
---
Another example that has come to light is that bosses have a 14% parry chance, while on private servers they were running at 6%.  This one change alone will have massive ramifications for how raids feel on Classic servers.  Threat generation will be significantly reduced, thereby reducing the amount of DPS a raid can put out, making it much easier for a dps to pull aggro, etc.
---
One thing I'm very interested to see is how fire packs in MC work on Classic.  I remember them being very difficult back in the day, and that the whole raid had to make significant investment in fire resistance in order to clear that part of MC.
---
On private servers, I was stunned to learn that fire resist was completely irrelevant and that any extra damage done by these packs was just healed through.
---
The game will be very different in Classic versus private servers, but this meme that Classic is going to be faceroll is completely baseless.
---
Well, His guide ended up crashing so i guess the people who subscribed for the guide got bent.
---
I saw your alchemy one was hoping for an engineer one, my hero.
---
That's sad.  I played wow in college.. now I'm married w/ no kids and my wife and I are going to binge the FUCK out of it in our spare time.  It'll be like being in college again... but I'll have used to the time to actually go to class ;)  Weekends are going to be amazing though.
---
&gt; Beginning in September 1941, Zyklon B, the brand name for hydrogen cyanide (HCN), was the poison used to kill at least a million people in gas chambers at Nazi concentration and death camps such as Auschwitz and Majdanek. Unlike the Nazis' earlier methods of mass murder, Zyklon B, which was originally used as a common disinfectant and insecticide, proved to be an efficient and deadly murder weapon during the Holocaust.
---
Maybe.
---
SWEHENNAS WILL RULE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS!
---
Ah, ofc it’s worth doing. I just see a lot of people trying to get it by 40 which is silly.
---
Yeah, I am a little concerned about what the experience for a new player will be. In retail people have little patience for inexperienced players, and I worry that pserver veterans and the vanilla know it alls will come in with a similar attitudes.
---
I'd try just switching from NA to Oceanic and then back to NA and see if the server list updates to be honest. It should refresh the servers without having to disconnect and restart the client.
---
Just speculation though, your mileage may vary.
---
I'll be going back and forth between Classic and Retail depending on  current retail patch content.
---
&gt; 13 years for me...Like 100s if not 1000s of UI elements in different panes.  Skills totally different.  Its a nightmare.
---
Wow imagine leaving a game for 13 years and it actually being *different* when you come back
---
ive gone negative with my productions, im actively distracting to coworkers at this point lol

Yes, and?

RIP, toilet. You served them well.
---
I don't have game time on my account and going to wait to see how bad the queues are before like committing to losing a day of game time.
---
Gutted that I probably won't get to play tonight when it launches. Work is going to DRAG tomorrow.
---
Ofcourse not it's not up yet.
---
It can't be replicated for you, but for someone like me who didn't play the game during vanilla (because I was playing other ones) I'm really excited to try out what I missed. I don't really know anything about the old mechanics.
---
That was a pretty good book. The Ghost writer did a great job.
---
What are the server pops listed as? What's not full?
---
Last time they got added to the list many hours in advance and simply came online at the appointed time. This time they aren't on the list yet and they're supposed to open in nine minutes, so I'm going to guess there might be a global reset.
---
This is fucking brilliant.
---
Stealth is super nice, and you can have some good shenanigans in the opposing faction's main cities. But I also love the rogue play-style in general, so I can't let that go. 
---
Now, as far as a casual alt or two? I have no idea what I'm leveling, but I'll probably be deep into leveling my rogue before I need to make that decision, anyways... Tempted to do a pally and a shammy for the faction flavors.
---
100% this.
---
Was just about to ask this...

You would be a filthy horde mongrel, living off scraps, wouldn't you.
---
Damn nice flex dude
---
What does dyk mean?
---
Dungeons are only worth running when you have a few quests for them.  You have to factor in travel time, waiting for people, doing quests for other people, if people leave, etc.  I skip them all together when you need prereqs for dungeon quests or if I need a break from questing.  IMO, it's not even worth it for gear as most blue items are only good for 4 or 5 levels and will be quickly replaced.

Ah, duh me. Looks awesome have fun man.
---
too late, already bought a new keyboard....
---
What about holding onto them and waiting for thr economy to get better and selling them when they are worth something? I know some boe greens are relatively useless, but some are very useful for leveling, and once people get their epic mounts and are leveling an alt those greens can sell for a good chunk.

It's only costly if you suck.
---
Maybe in the US. In my country it's a little different. High grades are required to enter medical school, due to the sheer number of people who apply. If less people did, the grade of admission would be significantly lower. Even now, once you are in, a passing grade is still passing.
---
i'm with you!! what time are we doing it?!

Yea BFA was smooth as butter.

I think people are overplaying this whole thing. I'm sure some people will be waiting over 2 hours but I'd be shocked if that's the norm.

"I hate this game so much"

\- My wife
---
You're a douchebag.
---
&gt; I was using my definition of pvp, which doesn't include much stuff yours do.
---
Your definition of wPvP is still a secret. The only thing we know about it right now is that it doesn't include fighting over resources or ganking. 
---
The only PvP that's left is BGs by definition that's not wPvP. So it's obvious that that doesn't include wPvP. 
---
Whatever your definition is, it's leading to the absurd.
---
That's why we are using my definition. Which includes everything in wPvP. Here your argument is that since it was technically possible to fight in the world, then world PvP wasn't ruined by flying mounts. We can see that here: 
---
&gt; Can you point me what pvp was there after BGs that wasn't in TBC as well?
---
But that is also absurd. Ganking was technically possible in TBC, obviously - that's not what I am arguing. What I am arguing is the fact that you can just mount up and become PvP immune is what ruins it. How many times has it happened that someone has hovered an area waiting for it to become safe? TBC: Impossible to count. Classic: Not even possible.
---
Your cat plays WoW?  That's awesome.
---
So I can find all these addons in twitch and just install them one by one there?
---
This is really kind, thank you. I actually work full time as a Line technician for my local Dealership, just not certified yet, so my income is still low.
---
People are really struggling with realizing this is a screenshot. Why would I first be racist and then second post about here. Awareness ?
---
Same thing, rip
---
Gonna be a lot upset and salty people over this
---
haha diapers get it he's going to play so much there won't be any time to take bathroom breaks, that's epic
---
Cool thank you!
---
Yeah.  So much for 10.
---
Have a friend lock it for you while you create it.
---
Let's go !!
---
20 is my goal I just don't think it will happen lol
---
wow I didn't know classic already released:
---
&gt;August 26, 2019 10:00 AM PST, we will remove the limitation on only creating a total of three WoW Classic characters per WoW account. Thereafter, players will be able to create up to 10 characters per Classic realm, for a total of 50 characters across all Classic realms per WoW account.

Oof it got me too. Kinda sucks missed out on some neat names, but it REALLY sucks that I cant reserve my usual name on extra servers now.
---
Hah, great name :P
---
I am thinking my main alt will be a warlock just for the solo farming ability, with a resto shaman main I won't be able to do much on my own.
---
GD indeed
---
Yeah :( this is rough.. Idk why the restriction hasn't lifted yet
---
i always thought it was “chums up, let’s do this” until i read a transcription once. god dammit this video is funny.
---
the fucking pause right after he screams his own name, good lord 😂
---
I get off right when launch starts so I’ll be starting 20 minutes late
---
He can save it for you. Once he deletes it, it is immediately up for grabs.
---
Memorize scroll positions on customization and do it at like 4am. You can do it in 10-15 seconds if you practice
---
Yeah it will let you in.
---
Just have a friend help you, it'll be easiest way if you're planning on trying to use that name and character tonight
---
GG Blizzard.
---
Well. If you're serious I'll absolutely "barter" it from you.
---
Glad it helped someone!
---
I had good luck using Wowhead's dressing room to figure out what I wanted, then deleting and remaking off that reference.
---
Your best bet would have been to do it a few days ago during off hours.
---
reeeeee
---
&gt;  And how many times has someone waited from afar for an area to become safe riding his epic mount?
---
That's not the same because you are attackable on an epic mount. 
---
If you want to say that PvP immunity from flying mount is the same as epic ground mount, you have to assume that the players are in a vacuum with no other players and no other ways for the other to dismount the epic rider. 
---
But that assumption does not fit vanilla World PvP because it's not a vacuum. 
---
1) Other players can intervene. 
---
2) There are numerous items and class abilities that can make you catch up anyway and/or dismount the player. 
---
3) The world is finite and it's often risky, or outright impossible, to run in a straight line. (Objects, mobs)
---
I want to say this too: It's also possible to get away. But that does not make flying mounts = ground mount in this regard.
---
But the bottom line is this: TBC flying mounts make you *literally* impossible to attack and that is very different from epic ground mounts.
---
I've been convinced on Undead Warlock for weeks now. When it's the very last day suddenly I've changed my mind to Night Elf Priest.
---
I rationalize it as I just want a more active role than what dps get in vanilla. Also I really wanted to be a Night Elf.
---
At least you can create a toon. Goddamn blizzard didn't increase the cap so fuck everyone who subbed earlier and has 3 on a non-backup server
---
"secret tricks"
---
Obligatory updoot for the diapers
---
No, they announced the removal of the character creation limit along with the new servers.  Both supposed to have happened at the same time.
---
They didn't drop the 3 char limit.... I got in the had to go back out now I'm back in the queue! Life!
---

right now I have:

---

---
leatrix
---

---
Please post when the cap is removed!
---
Biggest thing with warlock is you won't get your epic mount quest until phase 2. Well, won't be able to complete it until then. So any mention of a cheaper 60 mount is a couple of months off I presume. 
---
I personally would level a lock over a warrior but if that's a big factor in your decision it's worth considering.
---
Blizzard is a small indie company.
---
Hope I didn't take it :-/

Got **Aa** and **Oli** on the new server. Irony is I now am torn what to do. Think Ill play main on the busy server, but if queues are silly I'll hop on one of the above and depending on how this week goes might stick with it.

Another one who missed the fact that this is a screenshot. Sorry pal I'm not racist and you missed the point.

Why not? You can even see the affliction tree windmill in the background.

I've read in a guide posted here that as long as you keep up with your wands, you can level as holy just about as quickly as shadow due to the dpm of shadow spells (also you can heal 50+ dungeons easily too).

I'm hoping to get an offer soon on my house.  We've already purchased and the market is hot.  As a teacher who has the summers off the whole homebuying/selling/packing wore me out.  That and I didn't get as much golf as I wanted in before school started.  But hey, I've got classic and my daughter isn't due until December.  Play on!

bruhhhhh lmfao

Classic Blizzard...still manage to fuck up the simplest of things.
---
Yup, didn't get my name on new server because they decided to keep the limit.
---
That’s where you’re wrong. See Blizzard knows people don’t want classic so they’ll be like 70k total people logging in.
---
Keep waiting it will let you in.
---
You're a piece of shit
---
Warlock seems like it'd be cool because they have a rich array of class quests/fantasy from what I remember hearing
---
Aah, I remember now. They said the labels were relative.
---
Sounds good brotha see you on the other side
---
Same here. Goes Golemagg is in the trash, not it's firemaw, gehennas and razorgore
---
college may be the hardest thing you’ve done in your life up to that point. 
---
Fast forward: college is the easiest thing you will have done as an adult. 
---
2 papers per class per semester? 4-5 tests per class? 5 classes?! Each class only 2-3 days a week (rip language). The syllabus literally tells you what the class will be going over when you miss it.
---
Real life? Daily deadlines that don’t just determine your grade, but the survival of the business that pays you an income you use to feed yourself. 
---
Play the fuck outta wow while you’re still in fantasy land...
---
They just now opened up the new servers. Hopefully that will help.

our final moments of waiting for classic wow is going to apparently be a crotch shot of a tauren standing up straight

did you go to Target?

Vendor price

Why Mograine tho?

People who play osrs play it because they enjoy it. Saying it's subpar only relates to your experience with the game. If you think osrs players haven't played wow you're just wrong and quite closed minded

Yeah no shit, it has a cool name

Did the same with my Undead Rogue I played from late Vanilla through the launch of Cata.  Took him all the way back to Brill, where I dismounted and ran on foot back to the starting crypt equipped in my favorite gear.
---
I'll just wait for WoW Classic Classic in 2034!
---
If you're younger than 18, it's fucking awesome.  If not, the sadness scales with age.

Thanks homie. This was my fave char by far
---
That's a super cute picture idea.
---
I wish they gave out character boosts for classic...
---
HAHA yeah right
---
It appears were mixing the two up. I'm talking about the Undead with the Infernal at his back. Looks like a warlock to me.
---
Now good to go!
---
What if the second chair is for a wife/gf?
---
&gt; Classic+ could bring more BGs and maybe even arena.
---
I personally don’t PvP, but I have seen arguments from many people blaming Arena for the fall of class diversity and unique-ness in PvP. Classes started to be balanced around the 3v3/5v5 format and it lead to a lot of issues. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable than me can chime in, just wanted to make sure the point is made that things like Arena did cause issues for game balance. New BG’s I’m totally down for though :)
---
It’s lifted for me
---
&gt;We will be with you in spirit 
---
Come on men, don't be so hard on your self, you might be old but I am sure you'll do more than corps running. :)
---
Or WoW token gold.
---
On the official classic forum they say this, so you came on reddit a few hours before launch and just piled in, no context, saying people are being disrespectful. No wonder your being down voted to shit.
---
Classics not even launched, people will have different opinions of what happens next. So fucking what.
---
You fucking know full well that if classic goes well and brings in cash they will do it for other expansions. Also if classic is going strong, people clear Naxx and ask for more content there is a possibility of that.
---
Today theres a tone of people who would normally be playing other games just sitting around hitting f5 on all the forums and coming up with random shit. It will go quiet in a few hours.
---
Just chill and see what happens. When it's closer to the time and you think the community is holding back TBC then get vocal. Dont start getting chopsy  on another forum as you will just get yourself more worked up.
---
TIL. I mean I knew it wasn't good even if it had 0 sugar but that sounds terrible lol.

Well I mean it is the hype right now, now surprised

and he hasn't even begun to nolife grind levels!
---
Beat advice i heard in college was to treat your classes like a job. Wake up at 7 or 8. And go to class. In between, study, do whatever related to school. And aim to be done with school stuff for the day by 5. Like a full time day job. Its hard to do with outside factors like you being in your room with all those sweet video games. But it let me play 6-7 hours a day and on weekends i hung out with friends.

Same here, re-log if you still have it for some reason
---
Damn people really missed the joke
---
They've already stated that a) they have more servers ready to launch if/when they need to and b) people should spread out on current servers to reduce/balance queue times.
---
That isn't true and if you knew better wouldn't say that.

Can Orcs ride horses? I thought they and Tauren couldn't
---
I am alone orc warrior. I don't feel alone. Millions of others are out there playing this game with me. :D Plus...you can just meet people as you play :D

Put 5 points in it as it will make leveling with it easier. But you will also passively level it up.

Oh ok!  That makes much more sense.  I built a computer on Black Friday of 2012 for $600 with a GTX 760.  I didn't need monitors though.

I'm still using the same i5-3570k, but upgraded RAM to 16 gb, the video card to a GTX 980, replaced a broken power supply, and installed an SSD since then.  I've been thinking about upgrading the CPU, but would need a new mobo and RAM.  I have both amazon points and a microcenter near me, but I always sit on purchases forever since I'm a cheap bastard.

You have to actually attack with the wand to level it up. If you don't, you will miss a lot.

---
Maybe consider that leveling Enchanting to get the lvl 13 Wand definitely costs more money than just buying it from someone who crafted it. Especially when you make an that disenchants your BoE greens (possible at lvl 5).
---
Which classes can equip wands, in Classic?  I vaguely remember my rogue had handy throwing knives, but I don't recall her having a wand.

Like every other weapon the more you use it the more skill you get, you're mad skill would be your.level x5

&gt;Will I be able to head straight to Tirisfal Glade, and start the quest chains (leading into Silverpine Forest and so on) there no problem? I can't remember if there were race restrictions with some, like the Starting Area.
---
Some quests are restricted, but those are very few. So yes, you can absolutely do that. In fact, im planning to do that.
---
&gt;Will I earn enough Forsaken reputation to help towards this goal (while leveling)? Even if it's only to near honored.
---
You will gain a lot of rep, so its totally worth it to do this if you want undead mount. However note that you will still not be exalted by 40/60 even if you do this. Its just if you do it this way, you will have to farm far less cloth at 60.
---
Pretty much what I expected, you don't actually have any real reasons.

Don't level as holy...wand specialization is an important talent, skill increases as you use the wand.

I didn't skip class for wow but man I had a lot of free time during college to sink into vanilla. But now I am in the same boat, I will be lucky if I even have an hour a day to be able to play. Its ok though, I was able to rack up lots of server first kills in MC/BWL/AQ40 back in college. Now I am going to slowly level and read the actual quests.

Reading the quest text.
---
If you make it through the queues.
---
So 5 points is the max for that skill on the tree? Or does it get more as you lvl up

It is highly relevant. Classic also have been searched MORE than Hurricane Dorian today...

What the heck are Smith's? Do you live in the ghetto or just EU?

This just means you need to click your ranged auto attack ability and use your wand. This will increase your wand skill (which is similar to a profession and found in the same menu). You want to use your wand as you level so that when you are at higher levels when you go oom (out of mana) you can still auto attack with your wand and hit the target instead of having to run into melee range and using your staff or dagger.
---
In reasonably good conditions, sure. I'll have between 1 and 2 hours to play on average after the baby is in bed and chores are done, excluding days where there's just no time. This game can still be fun for those of us who have smaller slices of time to work with.
---
Because it feels good man.

Fuck off
---
That's a people problem, not a technical one. People sexually harass in chat, doesn't mean you get rid of chat. You report and move on.

I think IRL trading is a problem regardless of the tool being used, but I think a more restricted tool helps mitigate that further (see: LFG addon).
---
Classic Codex. Its like Questie but gives you a more precise location on the map of where to go.
---
First question: Yes, and because Undead have Warlocks you shouldn't have any issues with class quests/trainers.
---
Second question: Yes, you'll get rep for the quest completions.
---
It's already fixed. I have four characters on old blanchy rn

That's easy to remedy. If you are finding a lack of content in FFXIV just play Classic. Swap back as needed.
---
**NA / Alliance / PVP / Central Time/ Gnome Warlock**
---
Mature player with raiding experience in Vanilla, BC and WoTLK looking for a nice group of people to level, do dungeons, raid, PVP and generally have fun in the game. I only raided hardcore in BC but always did very well and know my class inside and out. For Classic, I think I'll be able to be semi-hardcore but I'd like to play the game first and see if how it goes. Much of it depends if I find a nice group of people to do it with. 
---
I'm open on realm but would prefer an EST server (I'm Central) and PVP. I do not foresee having any issues making raid times 2-3 days a week as long as it does not become a second job. I do always show prepared became I have shame and like to not suck. Hit me up! Need to choose my realm today!
---
was announced days ago brother
---
Incendius in NA already is medium too haha
---
I think you are confused because you think it is a battle and not a discussion.
---
You are/were trying to win instead of trying to understand. If you were trying to understand, you would know that my clarification and concession was agreeing with you, not moving the goalposts.
---
You can win the internet fight because you seem rather pathetic and maybe you need this.
---
You'll be blocked after I post this.
---
I hope your life is exactly as pleasant as you deserve.
---
Yeah, I feel like I had to queue half an hour most nights. But I was on a fairly high-pop original server.
---
damn yr a bummer dude
---
Based on the general tone, and knowledge regarding BfA; then no, most of this subreddit does not and possibly have never played BfA.
---
No it's an option on a dropdown on the retail page of the launcher.
---
Him picking those classes benefits me the most.
---
I was a dweeb and used my gf at the time's RL name as the name of my Gnome Rogue. I got into a flame-war one day and the person I was figuring with reported my name because it had a special character in it. I only had that special character in it because technically "shit" was in her name. Granted it wasn't my real name, but if my gf wanted to make a character with her own name they wouldn't allow it, always thought that was annoying.
---
How did you do that?
---
My gf loved the spelling of horde.   Lol she said her and kelly would probably be friends hah
---
I'm trying to distract myself as much as I can so the clock moves faster, but so far that hasn't worked haha
---
I'll look back fondly at riding this hype train with you all...but damn it right now I just want to play!
---
You are the alpha nerd.
---
Im either rolling on Razorgore or Mograine
---
Making me feel old i saw motley crue the first time during the theater of pain tour.
---
He was specifically addressing AMD cards. They may well be better for Nvidias.
---
For you maybe, it’s going to launch 3 PM here. And I’m playing on the west coast server so a lot of people will still be at work.
---
They can add more at any time. Literally instantly. Watch the last episode of ClassiCast. They have Omar and Brian from Blizz on the show and they talk about this a lot.
---
Same, are the queues going to be opened before the servers do? Or its all at the same time and tough luck if you didn't get in right away?
---
What are you? Twelve?
---
This right here, and I never even purchased a text book, just show up for exams and crush that shit. Ez
---
nah let him have his moment
---
as unavailable as it is
---
You know it's spelled wrong,  right?
---
A thing of beauty!
---
All at Medium already, except for Old Blanchy.
---
what are the specs?
---
I formatted my PC today. Feels like a clean shave!
---
Nah he’ll figure it out when nobody upvotes
---
Theres only gonna be so much gold per server in the first month, and if 90% of players are still levelling by then, nobodys gonna be farming very much to raise the gold supply
---
You can log in 30 minutes before to character select. More than that and you will time out.
---
Nethergarde Keep
---
If they actually get the next expansion right, you'll be able to replace the BFA box with classic when it comes out. 
---
I would MUCH rather play a new game than some nostalgic shit. The problem is that they seem intent upon ass fucking retail.
---
See you on the battlefield!
---
There's no serious Paladin the deal respectable damage in PVE.
---
And there will always be someone here spreading his holy wings and telling people that ret paladin or shockadin is a viable dps.
---
The truth is it requires SO MUCH grind for consumables and VERY SPECIFIC pieces of gear to even be close to an OK dps spec.
---
If you're going to put that much effort in a class, put it on a warrior and blizzard will ask you to stop dealing so much damage because you fury crits are make the server lag.
---
All dwarves must leave the fort some day
---
Good one Pan
---
It is candy and king. Candy from candy crush which is made by King and is a part of Activision Blizzard. /s
---
Holy god that sounds awful.. Yeah I'll take my 97+ with dry heat any day.
---
...I didn't even think about that one. Jesus Christ I am blind to the simple things.
---
I got Cosmic, Enigma and Transformer on Blanchy
---
Nightfall is still used in naxx...
---
Most guilds will use a warrior over a ret pally for nightfall
---
Probably not a pug raid.
---
D:
---
Nice, you must’ve been quick on the draw
---
I can't wait until people try that on the first pull in scholo/strat and just wipe the group when they break all of the CC immediately.
---
No love for Nethergarde Keep.
---
It’s also only base mana! Stats count for wayyyy more. Time saved on rep grinds is going to matter more than a tiny bit more mana pool (or not at all, for a Warlock like me)
---
Teamviewer is a pretty helpful app.
---
This was the only one my store had on the way out :( i didn't even buy the chips lmao
---
! remindme 2 days
---
30 mins you can sit on the realm screen before getting kicked.
---
I agree with you, what're some things you think retail could do with?
---
No no, let him be proud until someone says it in-game.
---
Sounds good, Ill be on at launch to weather the storm, Ill level up in Elwyn for the time being and when you spawn in IF ill take the tram to come group up.
---
Keep browsing reddit. You may find them!
---
Have you tried /feign death?
---
its almost like blizzard didn't want you to have the name blizzard. it's a mystery why though, who knows why such a random name would be disallowed by a company named blizzard.  hmmm
---
The circle jerking with character names is already enough for me. I thought we'd left the toxicity behind, but it turns out they were all waiting for the first thing to not go how they want it.
---
Hey man,
---
Based on what you're saying, you would probably fit in well with &lt;Buzz&gt; on Stalagg.
---
[Here is my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StalaggClassic/comments/csmhq5/buzz_horde_semihardcore_raiding) to the Stalagg subreddit that has most of our details. The main difference is that we're using an EP/GP system instead of DKP, but they are very similar loot philosophies.
---
We are a guild led by former hardcore raiders who are now looking to clear all content at a more sustainable pace. We are not pushing our raid core to grind rapidly to 60 and will be looking to enter MC with two weekly raid nights within about 3 months.
---
I am the GM of the guild, and our MT is an officer and personal friend of mine (as you mentioned) and I am not concerned about him leaving the guild unexpectedly at any time.
---
The shadow priest spec is no problem for us, you seem like a knowledgeable player and I'm sure we can make it work.
---
The Discord link is in the original post, if this sounds like a good fit for you, just hop right in! If not, no worries.
---
That is true :)
---
It'll either be filled with toxic posts from players forcibly offline, or posts complaining about being at work/class/etc and not playing.
---
On Mograine EU I got Liszt, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and others. If anyone wants to sell Paganini though lmk. Also got similar on Firemaw, got Mozart instead of Chopin though.
---
Ah, I actually didn't notice they just added new realms. Then I'll go for a medium populated one! I still hope it'll soon grow to at least high population though so there's more people to pvp with.
---
I am the opposite. I mained a Druid from classic and most of the later expansions. I know everything about that class.
---
So I am rolling shaman. Don’t know much about them and I have never played horde so maximum novelty!
---
im sure i will as my dwarf dies to an agressive ant-eater man.
---
Well, it's not the type of thing you plan for.
---
I switched all my characters from Pagle. I wanted to play PVP this time and have a better Alliance/Horde balance but I didn't like the initial PVP servers. Then every poll looked like Pagle would be 75/25. Incendius is a cool name, and the polls show it's one of the lowest PVP East for switching players.
---
I'm expecting returning Classic players to go Incendius to avoid queues. So less of a wait, cool name, and potentially knowledgeable mature players that stick around after months?
---
Sign me up.
---
Classic+.... nooo, it defeats the purpose and reason.
---
If you said TBC+, it would atleast make sense with seasonal gear. But I still wouldnt want that
---
Nothing but respect man! Only casuals take breaks!
---
They'll fill up quick since everyone can make 10 chars. However, Mograine hit medium after like four seconds while all the other new servers were still at recommended for quite a few minutes longer.
---
Your party wouldn't be very fun if everybody expected the main event to happen, and then it turned out that it didn't happen.
---
Specs?
---
Items have ilvls, if the game designers are using these to dictate what a raid/boss is 'worth' we can't discount them.  Hell everything could be ilvl 80 for all I care with crap stat weighting.   We can either be logical about this or emotional...
---
Will do. Thanks for the reminder.
---
Same. Part of me thinks the memekids will add to world pvp and will be fun to gank, so it may not be a bad thing. 
---
UGH SO HARD TO CHOOSE. I’ll main on one and go opposite faction alts on the other
---
This is me. I get out at 2:30pm PST... 
---
But...
---
I also have to run a few errands when I get out of work...
---
Then forget you haven’t leveled wands. Blink away
---
Lol, well at least I'm not the only dummy 😂
---
Poor, poor OP.
---
Yes I reserved my name but I forgot what server it was on.
---
This baby can hold so much release....
---
thanks I got almost every name I wanted on all the 4 new servers I'm so happy!
---
People rolling need on everything.
---
Your names are saved forever unless you delete your character
---
Hence the “was”.
---
Hmmmm
---
But the joke in the OP was specifically referring to medicine
---
Got screwed by blizzard yet again, got in the moment realms got up, created character... "sorry only 3 names allowed" - spammed enter dozens of times, nada.... - went back to delete 1 of those 3 names, logged back to the new realm, sorry that name is unavailable... FU U BLIZ.
---
Oh. People made it sound like the world was ending. Guess we gucchi now.
---
I paid, got my name, server got full so like Blizzard suggested I wanted to move to a new realm.
---
Mograine!
---
5 hours in queue, still haven't been able to login.. allready taken two shits 😅
---
Hell ya dawg I get you but it's only a short while so hang onto your britches.
---
Lol thex
---
The art direction aside from armor sets was great all around.
---
2complicated4me
---
Alot of those names seem like perfectly normal RP names, but maybe it means something in other languages IDK.
---
Better to say NA players get the game "early", rather than say all of the eastern hemisphere gets it "late".
---
If they said it came out on the 26th, lots of unreasonable people would be mad they can't play 'till the 27th, despite release being the same time globally. On the contrary, tons of people will be excited they have to wait "one day less" because of time zones.
---
"Who could have predicted this would happen?!"
---
Aahh.. to be 14 again
---
Combat and the way abilities work in retail are much more dynamic tbh.
---
Because it's a capitalist hellhole?
---
You really nailed the girly handwriting
---
For us, the wait for Classic is over. But let us never forget those who spent nights, months, tinkering on adventure hosted out of their own pockets. Those who defended their passion from the corruption within and the judgement of others. Those who made the difficult decision to surrender their work and reach for something greater. Their leap of faith started a song of protest that grew to over 250.000 voices strong and was delivered to the very doorstep of those who could not hear us before.
---
Many bore this torch, lighting the path in the face of doubt, ridicule and unforgettable dismissal.
---
A struggle which required patience, courage and no small amount of sacrifice. After all, as our new journey begins, their servers will remain shut down.
---
As the years go on their tale will become a legend gladly told, fondly remembered, shared across various corners of the internet.
---
They did this all of us, and they shall not be forgotten.
---
Perhaps they meant 1:00 PM EDT?
---
Ahh it says starter edition, but when I got to purchase a month it says I already have one.
---
Just checked my paypal and I wasn't charged, and now the website is being super slow. It seems the problem will be fixable on there somehow, thanks
---
No one wants more than one shadow dps* shadow weaving is op.
---
just look at this artwork :)
---
its unbearable
---
You can only sit in the character screen for 30 minutes, after that you get kicked back to the login screen. Pretty risky, because the servers need sometimes a few minutes longer.
---
Lvl 1-10 will take much much longer then 45 minutes
---
With the exception of the rank grind.  That one can’t not be overblown, it’s right loco.
---
Even for my non project class that's basically the gist of it. Show up, actually pay attention (for some reason a lot of people like to go shopping while in class on their laptops), take notes, review notes, maybe make some flashcards day before the test, get an A, done.
---
And yeah I'd probably do the same if I could. Classes start next week so there's gonna be a bit of no life-ing for a solid week lol
---
waht the fuck
---
If you're going Rogue, I'd really suggest you do it because of the weapon skill bonus.

---
Go hunter. It's ranged, but in a completely different way, plus you get a pet that can be melee.
---
I believe it was 10 silver and 10 signatures. It doesn't seem like much, but considering that the starting quests only gives you a chunk of copper at a time and some future guild leaders are racing in an unstable server if they even get it, it seems like one stressful grind.
---
Yeah I know it's boring how Humans are the best race lol
---
I'm using add-ons.
---
Didn't back in the day, but why not.
---
I want my hud to look clean.
---
Well you have over 200k (at least) people logging in today to queue. So expect this shit on launch days
---
hoo boy do I hate that. The sabotage thing.
---
People might ask, why are some guys so pussy-whipped, they never come out to see their friends, they never do this or that, always sitting at home with their gf/wife.
---
Some people just don't understand that there are very big reasons for that. And one of them is - if they were to go out, and enjoy themselves, the moment they come home - any joy or fun that they might have had in the last 2-3 hours, is immediately punished by 8-10 hours of grief.
---
It's as if the aggrieved actively find some reason to punish their beloved for having a good time without them. So then therefore instead of the rollercoaster which end up not being worth, they'd rather stay home.
---
I honestly thought that would be unnecessary, and realistically if battlenet is already struggling then the chances of playing tonight have got to be slim.
---
Hours of queues for like, what, 2 weeks tops?
---
Or having the character name you desire, forever.
---
Blizz definitely dropped the ball.
---
I got scheduled for working 12 hour overtime shifts this entire week so I got to wait until the weekend until I can really get into classic!
---
Maybe play for like 30 - 60 minutes every night between those shifts...
---
You have got to be joking.
---
Very good rebuttal, I am truly defeated.
---
For what it's worth I've used this mouse since Legion launch and 3 of my IRL friends bought it in prep for Classic 10 months ago - solid mouse. Comfy, and works like a charm. I think it's like $38 on Amazon or something. Should be called \*\*UtechSmart Venus\*\*
---
Same bro, cant add any game time
---
Gonna do some addons. Addons were a thing in Vanilla anyway. I'm not gonna install anything I wouldnt have been able to back then.
---
How do you have that many characters?
---
&gt;Anyone else having such problems?
---
yeah probably the hundreds of thousands of other people trying to do the same thing that crashed it.
---
It's a PvE server, it will grow a bit slower. But I'll be there!
---
A name is more important than playing exactly on time, now that they ruined it many people won't be able to have their name of choice.
---
Fap
---
I m really bad with computer specs but from what I know I have a i5 processor with a GTX-1050 videocard,
---
It used to run games such as retail wow with add-ons , GTA V and such easily but idk what happened to it, that s why I am kind of sceptical about it running classic WoW
---
Well good thing it looks like you've got plans to be inside all day :)
---
After a quick glance at your post history, please stick to your decision and stay far away
---
I'm on char select right now and just made 2 more charts 1 on a second server. 5 total and counting
---
I know I just really like my Night Elf ha
---
This is true. Paladins are almost too straight forward. And the leveling is atrocious.
---
Might be a sign of people trying to buy lots of game time all at once right now, I had trouble finding it in the bnet client shop to gift to a friend but searching game time in there pulled it up.
---
I have some serious shit going on in my life and this was going to be the break from it!
---
Oh no
---
Healer: pretty good in pvp and pve, because of utility.
---
Enhancement: Warriors/Rogues will love you in pvp for the windfury totem. They're alrigth overall, because they bring utility. Pvp is a mixed bag. When the windfury hits just right, you're a beast, but most of the time it doesn't. I still enjoy it though.
---
Elemental: Okay in pve, bursty in pvp.

Overloaded RIP. I was worried it may happen so I bought mine this morning.
---
Hopefully it'll settle down.
---
Perception is not permanent. It’s only 20 seconds and you can never anticipate when to use it. It’s useless for every occasion except duels against other rogues.
---
Stacking crit chance with duel wield windfury was one of my favorite ways to play a shaman back in BC. Quad crits will make you giggle like a little girl in pvp.
---
No addons, at least for tonight.
---
I've always presumed (no direct knowledge) that Server Pop would measure unique players with at least 1 character on the server. since a player can only log on with 1 character at a time. Am I wrong?

Same and I regret that I didnt do this yesterday already.

It can get you fired in a lot of places in the US.  Some places won't even let you date within your own department at all.  They say it leads to favoritism if you are dating your boss because you will receive preferential treatment.

Here's the dark secret of Classic: all dps are more or less "boring" in terms of rotation. Mage and Warlock are like brothers, one will place a curse assigned to them, the other will remove them from the raid, they both cast their chosen bolt spells, and they both have to supply the raid with endless water or endless summons/health stones.
---
You missed Rein. 😀
---
OSRS. The other classic winning formula.
---
Asslord is pretty good tbh
---
First in best dressed.
---
Honestly today isn't too bad. It's probably due to the fact I expect either a several hour long queue at 6pm or the server just crashes and I don't get on till later tonight.
---
Yeah, because the forums and the game are hosted on the same server! /s
---
Addons were normal in classic too. People without addons did not succeed in raiding or pvp at the level they could have with addons. There is no shame in configuring your ui to give you the information you want in a format that is aesthetically pleasing. Here's my addon folder for classic:  
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/k3MEpmg
---
My plan is to go no addons until I start doing dungeons. Then grab a dps meter. Then I am not planning on not using any other addons until 60 at least. 
---
But I was never one to use too many addons in retail either.
---
Yeah sorry I dress to slutty for billionaires I totally deserve it.

If it doesn't already have a high population by the time I get home from work, and both my name and my brother's names are available, I'll switch. Otherwise, I will have to stick to Stalagg. Unfortunately I think there's a very good chance it will be high or full population before I ever make it home, so Stalagg will most likely be my home.

No don’t you get it, nobody will be playing at 3, it’ll be too crowded. /s
---
You think ? No way
---
What are you?  like 9 years old?
---
1/10, for each name!
---
Yeah and scripting and pathing there was bullshit, too. (Was my first p-server)
---
But the instant server (al akir? Ahn'qiraj?)  was pretty funnsy because of the battle grounds.
---
Was later on Kronos (Before Kronos got splitted in several sub servers), that was my first "quality" p-server.
---
After that finally found home on the german p-server Nefarian which was a beautifull time, got my warrior even into Naxxramas for some bosses before i had to move in rl. This, Naxx burn out and "Classic is coming!" let me finally quit p-servers.
---
Well I made this post in the first place because I didn't see any similar threads on this sub in /new
---
Yeah I’ll be running two accounts for that reason

Jesus, bought like an hour ago, i'm so glad I did

No weebs
---
Lol blizzard is seriously under estimating this launch
---
Hmm, check which account it went onto.  I know when I went to renew mine, it gave me a choice of two accounts, one with my WoW account name, and another one that I assume was a starter/trial account.
---
Can Confirm, Emerald Dream on retail was a WPVPers most wildest dream.
---
Half of those names will probably be reported
---
Same got mine this morning
---
They removed the limitation shortly after adding the new realms
---
also if you want to PM your email I can send you a list of addons that ive researched and have been said will be good to have.
---
Perhaps if you'd only read the meditations of Marcus Aurelius and cross-referenced that with the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire and the early works of Tacitus then you'd understand the complex sociocultural flourishes that dictate race in Azeroth. :p
---
I prefer to be called bombastic. Anyway have you found any of the info you're looking for because I'm honestly pretty curious too. 
---
Back in 2005 on Archimonde we strived for relative consistency between factions for world pvp but that was all decided in forums during the original beta. 
---
My wife is taking her first steps into PvP this time around so I hope there's a good breakdown. In my experience it seems like the Horde attracts more hardcore PvPers and alliance attracts more traditional fantasy-game fans and PvEers.
---
Lol feels bad when your pea brain can discern an implicit if.
---
This so much. We never kill our fellow Tauren druids. Ever.
---
For a nice tip if you don't know, log into the character selection screen and when servers go live the enter world button should glow red. It's been confirm by blizzard staff this will work and save u more time entering.

You got $15?  Buy a WoW subscription card from a store.

100% certain there is no grace period. Also, I highly doubt there's a bot taking anything. What actually happened is you were foolish enough to delete a character while tens of thousands of people are making new characters
---
If you run to Tirisfal Glades, you'll be missing class trainers for several Tauren classes.  It's probably not the end of the world but it's going to be painful at the beginning.
---
Orc warriors are one of the best pvp classes in the game, and are on par with Tauren warriors in PvE. You cna switch from best tank in the game to best dps in the game with a respec and some different gear. Honestly, paladins kind of suck in vanilla. They are healers and buff bots. People keep thinking they are going to be something they are not based on retail.
---
Friend of mine wasn't allowed Thinking as it contained mature language either. Tis a bit weird.
---
Don't get married to someone who doesn't support your gaming needs.
---
&gt;crawl your eyes out
---
Any attempt at power shifting will get the druid dumpstered so unless you're balance and moon fire spamming you're done and no one levels like that.

It's crazy to think that sometime after vanilla launch I bought a 19' inc CRT and the time this monitor was so big and so amazing. A world opened. And now I'm gonna play vanilla with my 34'inch ultra wide screen samsung panel.

Trusting Blizzard has screwed me so many times.  
---
Only natural to start off this adventure with it.
---
No, I'm saying people most likely got mad he added the subscription for his service ending with his site being doxxed.
---
If they can handle 500 accounts per second and about 50k per server it’s a little over 1.5 minutes.
---
Yeah I dont miss the 4 hour wait-time.
---
yeah this
---
login approx 25\~ minute before servers get up, because u will get kicked after 30 mins on login screen and just spam enter world button when possible.
---
Guarantee you that is not happening on any server.
---
 [My response.](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1ujSX3RBSeE)
---
I quit my job and emptied my savings account
---
Only thing to look out for is to make sure you're a class that can also be undead. Otherwise you'll have to get to a main city every time you need to train new spells.
---
Not the end of the world, just inconvenient.
---
I can’t wait to get bored of standing around waiting to pull and being the sneaky rogue that I am, decide to aggro some eggs and vanish sprint to the entrance.
---
There's literally thousands of people making characters on each realm right now.. why would you wait until right now to do it? You've had weeks to do it.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping I can get in, but I don't think I will, as I don't get off work till 1.5hrs after launch. The 27th might be my true Launch Date.
---
&gt; though I hear leveling isn't great.
---
It isn't, but it's also not the misery that solo warrior leveling is. Once you have poison, things are looking up, and as long as you have a decent weapon for your level, it's pretty okay (you will want First Aid, of course).
---
Yeah people are reporting issues with the store right now
---
Can I get an f in the cat boys I start my shift tonight at the time it starts

Why does the name Herod make you think it’s more Horde specific? Pretty sure it’s called that because of the NPC Herod in SM, not because of the anagram. Curious.
---
No u
---
The music started playing in my head as soon as I saw this lol
---
Howd you get so many chatacters made?
---
Lol! I would probably say the same to my kid to be honest.  It just takes too much of a kids time and they aren't able to self-manage like (functioning) adults do.
---
Lol yea man having a significant other is rough. Only reason I think sabotage is I was like “28 hours babe!! And she scoffs” I’m like nahhhhhh
---
Ah ok. I got that from the context but didn't know what the abbreviation is coming from. Thanks.
---
Nice one
---
Relog my man
---
Generic was taken.
---
Be ready to click enter world.  But you’ll be DCed if in the character screen for 30 minutes.
---
Have faith bro even if there’s some queuing on this launch which there’s bound to be. Being on a server that’s medium has been said to be the same as a full server back in the day. Yes people are going to leave but I don’t think any of these ones that are medium or even high will be a “dead” server. Have you made chars on the new realms?
---
Thanks for the story! I feel bad for your friend. D&amp;D, much like WoW and other video games, is a creative outlet to explore unrealistic/unachievable fantasies. 
---
My name is what I thought a cleaver euphemism for alcohol was. 
---
There's also apparently a Bible audio book website with the same name.
---
 SMALL STREAMERS GUILD &lt;3
---
I love to stream and i love to talk with you guys and i was thinking about switching it up and adding some variety by playing WOW tonight instead of league of legends. Could also be talked into a minecraft monday but just wanted to guage what you guys want to see (:
---
As always the focus is going to be on mental health and talking about positive things so just come with a positive attitude and ask any questions about me or my life or just tell me your story &lt;3 much love to everyone who comes!
---
To join just submit your user name to our discord server here (: [https://discord.gg/F8jren](https://discord.gg/F8jren)
---
the stream is going to be at [twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://twitch.tv/spidermojo) and start at 5:45PM EST
---
Yeah. I think you’re defining it as worth it like monetarily or professionally. I’m defining it as making you happy enough to warrant the trade off, Aka what most people say when they make a “bad” decision lol “worth it”.
---
Holy and disc are about equal for levelling I think. The main thing to always do is take the wand spec and spirit tap talents, and maintain wand progression. 
---
There's a spec called "smite spec" which is a good blend of healing and dps. [Smite build here.](https://youtu.be/_CLytIpJniY?t=1423)
---
Last one to moonglade is a rotten egg
---
But is seeing that random character really 'community'. It doesn't effect your ability to play with friends/guilds, doesn't effect your ability to talk to people in cities and form groups. Instead of seeing the same guy 10 times, now you'll see 10 people once, so you have even more people to interact with and form a community with. 
---
At the end of the day, layering makes the game playable at release.  This is just a completely overblown issue, no one is going to notice any negative effects of layering, and then a couple months in it's going to be gone entirely.
---
Frankly I'll be upset if there *isn't* some kind of crash.
---
each expansion just gets worse and worse. you would think they would have learned by now
---
np, have fun today and the rest of the week! :)
---
Basically me, remove 1 Red Bull though.
---
I'm only eating caffeine pills and drinking 50/50 sugar mixed with Gatorade.  I said what I said.
---
Facts are on my side.
---
They’re all garbage. I feel sorry for your toon
---
I'm letting you ppl have launch all to yourself. Gonna start early in the morning instead since i'm gambling on the launch being a mess. No sense sitting in queues for hours.  
---
But then again I might be wrong.

Did you just do it? Server may be warming up right now, and your deleted character may not have registered server side...
---
These are just random words though. I always thought people who had names like this just didn't give a fuck and wrote something random down.
---
If you only want the starter zone then you’ll need to wait.
---
VanCleave for a warrior.
---
Close enough to smell each other’s duck butter 3 days in
---
9 more minutes then I can head home and setup for the night!!!!!!
---
oh boy, I fixed it! I bought a new grapgics card last week and somehow the wow classic app doesn't recognize it, somehing about 3d not being able to work. saw that in windwos safe mode... had to reset, uninstall drivers, reinstall...
---
oh geez, the happiness!! LOL
---
Hahaha totally, they always said me sitting in front of the computer is just a waste of time and I'm ruining my self.
---
I socialized in wow, made friends, actually started to learn English and learned about computers.
---
Now at 30 I'm a lead software engineer in the international banking sector. People like you can fuck a cactus ^ ^

You don't *have* to take people's advice.

You don't *have* to have a functioning digestive track, either.

reverse it and it’s a lot of people’s assholes after eating those posted snack pictures
---
No doubt! The chicken salad sandwich is awesome when it's in season, and I live off of the Turkey and Swiss.
---
If you can’t buy it yourself then you aren’t old enough to play
---
Same here dude, i am pissed...
---
There are threads here where you can add players on your realm to initially level with.
---
Contrary to what you are thinking, wow is a MMO meaning there are tons of people playing.
---
If you want to interact with people then you're going to have to add them, at least at first.
---
I'm worried about the name affecting the population.  It took a while for Blamo to hit medium pop and all the new pvp servers are medium instantly.  I understand it's due to the name restrictions being lifted, but I still could see Blamo falling behind the new ones.
---
Had to go somewhere after the shitshow that was Whitemane. I got my names! 
---
But yeah, same. That’s why I also got my names on Bigglesworth (mostly)
---
Not sure if we are still memeing or are some people taking this way too seriously
---
I address the temporary aspect of it in my post, and why, even if true, Layering is still bad for the game.
---
&gt; kite to death.
---
Mages aren't the ones doing the kiting in this matchup...
---
For some reason the name "windex" has never worked for me
---
The thing was that up through Wrath I had connections with many guilds. In my most recent outing in Classic, it was difficult to build connections with anyone I didn't already know.
---
I don’t think Duality breaks that rule. You’re right that someone might not agree but i doubt he’d be name flagged
---
Unique players I believe it was a forum post last week
---
Wowww I’ve not played retail for years but that is a mental sight! It’s dead!
---
&gt; are you sure about that?
---
Well, that's how it worked for me half an hour ago. Made toon, forgot to get the piercings to my liking, decided to risk it, remade it, worked.
---
Need more info. How old are you? What are your grades? What do you do around the house?
---
No, just play the game. Everyone one reddit and other places are so consumed with min/maxing and racing 60. If you are brand new just go with it.
---
WIN!
---
Thanks pal!  Good Luck today!
---
please refrigerate those monsters you animal.  
---
But yea very coo
---
I clicked create character
---
Log on the server when there's 25 minutes left.
---
In my mind, Herod is a harsher sounding word and people will be primed to enter as Horde because of the spelling (same letters, different order than Horde)
---
Asking for upvotes violates intergalactic law.

Last time I used beast like your was like 30 minutes to work, 30 minutes to cry.

Mine was stored in a room where people where smoking for years, so every time I turned it on it was no reason to go out for smoking.

Thank you. He’s been texting me non-stop about how excited he is today. I can’t wait til he gets home from work!
---
Lawyer up.
---
I took off Friday and Tuesday. Figure it won’t be worth having Tuesday/Wednesday off in lieu of any server/queue issues.

I got Lolgolas in one of the realms.
---
&gt; "launch went smoothly and everybody was happy".
---
I literally cannot order game time. Let's modify this sentence into "With a small few hiccups, everything went perfectly." Hiccups are to be expected, of course. :)
---
Chrome rewinding time should be canon for classic plus. 
---
Let the world become self aware that we already did this and before and have lore focus on making sure we do it right this time.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
it sounds like their going to kick every one off right before launch regardless. just try and log on at around 4:30 ct and pray
---
madman
---
Yeah, I have a plan that I think will let me get in without queuing. It's kinda scummy but fuck it, this is Warcraft.
---
Also, according to Blizzard expectations, half the population will be gone in a few weeks. so they should all end up with a normal population as for vanilla "standards".
---
&gt;!Because the Brazilians and Porteguese went there for better ping and higher pops.!&lt;
---
thought you were going to be warning them to not risk their future for wow.
---
I like this message a lot more lmao!
---
Well i hope the 30 mins boot thing is true..i assumed I could switch back n forth between characters and avoid being booted.. I'll juat be on 30 minutes on the dot. Hope it works. Have 3 days off of work for this fiasco
---
Zug zug. Gonna be killing every ally I see.
---
&gt; he suggested fighting Cthulhu 
---
:)
---
Ah, it's in a different spot, that was it, thank you.
---
Yeah today was probably the worst day for this.
---
Dude I've been saying this lie to everyone for the past 14 years.
---
If you are in Central time, that would be at 5pm
---
I mean you still haven't explained how I am ruining anything for people.  And yes, you are proving me correct, even if you are "ruining my complaining", since I am a person and complaining is stuff, you are the one actively ruining stuff for people.
---
What is this "Boralus" you speak of?
---
this is what I mean! Could you imagine if we changed the timeline completely? What if Arthus fights off the Lich King instead of embracing him? What if Sylvanas doesn't betray everyone at the gates? So many lore heavy options!
---
Druids are roughly 5% of the population and Warrior is around 20%.  
---
I'd take the druid, for instance tanking they are pretty even with warriors.
---
It's more like, even if there is world PVP on PVE servers, it's not the same. Grinding on games like these are a lot more fun when there's something at stake.
---
It's like the deadman mode in runescape oldschool. When you actually have to pay attention to the grind for fear of PVPers, it gets your adrenaline going and makes it more enjoyable.
---
Let me start by saying I hate the Alliance. 
---
But that. That is sweet man. Props.
---
You do know the famous "Unbreakable" video is an Enhance Shaman mowing down people, right? More so Nightfall makes Enhance really useful, more so than any other class with Nightfall. 
---
You shouldn't give advice if you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Seeing all the full servers and them needing to add more just made the absurdity of that statement even more telling of that disconnect, so I had to make a low effort post out of it.
---
In all seriousness, be careful man. I served 10 years myself and I know its easier to live off monsters and cigs, but I had a buddy who decided to quit both and he died from a heart attack a few days later. Shocked his system too hard to just stop cold like that.
---
Why the fuck do you post this? Tell me, why?
---
Can't destroy what's already destroyed. Ye, no sugary drinks in my schedule.
---
Alliance to start.
---
Ha yeah conveniently forgetting the part where you don’t actually get max level but max from the previous expansion so you don’t have to go though 15 years of content before playing the expansion advertised. BfA bad. 😎
---
Ahh so you were playing with mega blocks while I was leveling in stranglethorn lol
---
Play FFXIV, you'll get to kill Ifrit with Fireballs
---
11pm is pretty good actually, none of my guild is stuck in work.
---
Moolester
---
Considering that those things often don't start in time, you maybe better log 25 minutes before to get a bit of a buffer.
---
I do feel bad for any Retail guilds that get sundered because of Classic.  That kind of turmoil is never fun and I don't wish it on anyone.
---
It's it's not Midnight in Murica, what time is it in Murica?
---
Of course he's got the MCP haha.
---
Definitely can still do well and I’m not saying don’t aspire to various goals (ambitious or otherwise) since that’s part of the adventure.  I just want to emphasize not ruining your week/month/year/life like too many people did the first time around.  It should go without say but these games have had shocking effects on people.
---
Same its been an hour.
---
Yeah world PvP on PvE servers exists, but isn't as fun as a real PvP server. Its mostly zerg v zerg on pve, where pvp server you get much more opportunities for 1v1 and smaller skirmishes.
---
I think the recent survey showed a \~55% vs \~45% split for Horde vs alliance.  Thats pretty damn good IMO.  Its when you get 80/20, then you got a real problem.  
---
I hope the servers stay within the 60/40 ranges for balance.
---
Lol I totally get the more money than time thing now as well.
---
Yep, i got Me, House, Rough, Magnavox, Video

Iunno, enh without two-weapon fighting just doesn't feel right to me, it became too ingrained during BC. I'm a huge fan of elem, though, so even though I'm maining Alliance, I'll have an elem shaman on another realm for soul-healing purposes \^\_\^
---
You decided to do this now when everyone is free to create 50 characters? Not very smart.
---
Sick keyboard breh &lt;3
---
Damn, good guy ISP 😭
---
Thanks! I got lost in beta for ass a lot for so long!
---
And I'm celebrating that I just got a second monitor today for launch lol. Have fun in 3,5 hours my friend!
---
It's one of the reasons. 
---
Retail players incessantly asking for legacy servers, AMAs and Blizzcon is one of them, the hard work of devs that made it possible to emulate classic on a modern client without knowing it would pay back is another and the huge community of pservers proving the demand for it is the third. 
---
It's a trinity of events that led to classic. If no one kept WoW going for so many years, it would be one more for the list of dead MMOs. Blizz would probably work on the next Warcraft game, the other franchises and move on. If all the pservers had low population and were short lived, it would mean that Classic is not something worth investing in. And in the end, the final decision was made by passionate devs that made it possible, despite technical difficulties and the original public statement against legacy servers. 
---
We should stop diminishing the actions of the parts involved and enjoy the fact that we're a few hours away to what so many have been wanting for so many time.
---
During the AMA they stated that you would be able to sit on your character screen and "Wait" for the button to turn RED. So... What you said doesn't comply.
---
I fucking love you.
---
Yeah, back in the day I was playing @1280x1024 and today it's 1080p
---
It's a meaningful difference
---
We probably wont be able to get through the queue till midnight anyways so you were originally correct lol.
---
Nobody can possibly know how the population will end up. Just flip a coin.
---
&gt; Will I get a small kick and then drop hard? 
---
That depends if you're going to include sugar. Drink as is without sugar and cream + eat plenty of fruits. People loading up on sugary energy drinks are going to feel like shit after the first week. The former won't. Worst case scenario you sip on a sugar free redbull/monster if you really need to.
---
I've narrowed it down to hunter or mage. Been watching videos throughout the weekend and still cant decide!! I like aspects of both classes. Gahhhh..
---
Not really, there is a lot of fear mongering by people thinking the same as you trying to get as many people on their realm as possible.
---
They have already said that paid server transfers are possible should they be required if realms die.
---
&gt; many people won't be able to have their name of choice
---
That would be true no matter what. If I didn't get the name I wanted, that means someone else got the name they wanted.
---
Legos actually but yeah
---
then likely westfall will be your best bet. I'm horde, and have names on both, but only will play westfall if it's a clusterfuck on Mankrik tonight
---
Water is the plan!
---
Dwarfs eyes look like he's had a bit too much thunder brew ale.
---
I enjoy grinding gold and stuff without getting ganked when I'm not in the mood. I get it tho
---
Most of the speed leveling guides skip westfall for darkshore.
---
He will definitely need to upgrade the CPU. I play wow on an Intel i5-3230m dual core clocked at 2.6ghz and it is awful and heats up so quickly.
---
That's fair. =)
---
And I'm glad for that, because the private server communities were mostly awful. I thought playing Dota for years had prepared me for anything, but Christ were some servers toxic.
---
Horde or alli
---
Currently logged in at 7:30 GMT and hoping I can keep relogging
---
Go on a walk. Play with my daughter. Maybe get something going on the smoker...oooo...get something going on the smoker.
---
Power shifting eats immense amounts of mana, especially at early levels. 3 shifts and you're oom. I think y'all are basing this on far more recent patches than 1.13. If the mage has CoC you're definitely done.
---
Pick one in your time zone. Queue will be back to start then it will die down after most newbie found out what classic is really like.
---
or you go furry for 40 leveles and then respec to arms :)   
---
feels better to me
---
they just unlocked the limitation on characters so deleting to remake is not good to do right now.  EVERYONE is shooting to max out their 50 character per account max.
---
source?
---
I send my GF away for the next two days instead. 😃
---
Trying to answer your question I realized that I probably was penalizing eating/drinking other than the regeneration time.  So I added a fixed 5 second penalty for eating/drinking which slightly changed the overall effectiveness of each spec.  After that change I get these statistics:

I don't have time to analyze this fully but it looks like until frost gets a new rank of frostbolt at level 50 damage mitigation is an issue.  It may be worthwhile to retest frost using frost nova now that the environment parameters have changed somewhat.  the frostbolt-scorch (elemental) build still performs well.
---
I’m in the same boat. Best time pre launch is likely about 2 hours before. 
---
After that, wait until 2am lol
---
"Yea, late lunch at my place, let yourself in, ill be in the back....ALL DAY"

I had a sammich in my head.
---
Works fine for me.
---
I would have flipped them around :P
---
Yeah it's a good reason too, I did a totally overkill with my home server and the 750W PSU. My goal was that the fan would NEVER start running.
---
This what steers me away from druid. I like the idea of druids, but I hate healing in groups. I'm not so keen on tanking either. But I love using those skills when leveling on my own. I just don't want my guild to be calling on me for roles I really don't want to do. I'm a DPS person when grouping.
---
I used “willitclassic.com” downloaded questie and bagnon(for all bags grouped together and gives a number count in your bag for free space) only addons I use

Life hack for you, red lights and stop signs are just suggestions when there are no other cars.
---
Rend scales better with 1 handed weapons, HS scales better with a 2H weapon.
---
You're obviously not going to be sitting there with a spreadsheet doing the math or respeccing every time you get a new weapon, so just play the one you want to play.
---
Unfortunately yes. Some server skew heavily to one faction, some servers MIGHT die out. It’s hard to know. Herod is a terrible choice for day 1 but might be the healthiest server over time. We just don’t know
---
We actually thought being the underdog on Mankrik as Alliance, we would encounter more World PvP scenarios.
---
It's funny because I am leveling a rogue first and he's going warlock.
---
That is a valid point, they did promise otherwise in their bluepost, which i would really like to follow through on, else you screw alot of people.
---
Which did happen, from what i can see in other peoples posts
---
Oh, I misunderstood.  My mistake.
---
What movie did you have the kids watch while you did this? Lol
---
An axe that... isn't even in game? Never seen that skin in vanilla
---
That's an interesting idea, do you have a way to edit out your character? Maybe use a gnome and stand in a bush :D
---
I think screen recording software would be really cool to do an animated map, as long as you could get a decent loop, that is.
---
That's pretty cool, wish I knew that then. I'm doing Horde now, I do remember there is a place you can die or fall into in the Orc starting area where you can res in Ratchet. That's a cool trick to waste a bunch of time trying to get back.

His snack hoard seemed pretty balanced up until he had the fridge full of soda. Heh

Wait how often do you guys have maintainance like this were your internet goes out?

and now it's High

If mickey d's in Germany is anything like the one I ate in Russia, you are probably right.

Rip

left out the part where he has to run back alone to rez everyone.
---
"Guys it's not rigged!....Unbelievable!"
---
Those times are dynamic, so it only says 1 because I'm in EST. The troll was the name reservation limit happening before new realm name reservation opening which it did not.
---
Are you guys doing a full night of queue streaming?
---
You should put the monster in the fridge - it's harder to shotgun them if they're warm.
---
Lol banished from classic to be stuck in retail. Even i think that is cruel, but haha its so funny.
---
yeah this has been a problem for hours. will probably last for many hours more. 
---
seems like blizz made sure to set up emergency game realms but didn't think to prepare for a flood of gametime orders.

---
Yes, i realize that, thanks
---
based on my experiences with the beta testing, a lot of people I talked to really enjoyed the experience and are eager to play.
---
Better than 3 hours from now....  Just hope that feature update goes through, and doesn't eat your Windows install.  Sending good vibes!
---
It's not really true. I see people constantly when I play
---
It was engineered to be playable on the Playstation 3.  FFXIV 1.0 was released for Windows and the PS3.  The PS3 has considerably less memory than most computers so the world maps had to work within the PS3's memory limits for all platforms since the game is played cross platform.  So after version 1.0 flopped the studio kept their promise of releasing on the PS3 for the version 2.0 release despite the PS4 just recently being released.
---
I’m a... ffFFfull-on-rapist?
---
Been coming to this sub every day multiple times a day for months and never seen it. Instead of being a dick about it you could simply post it.
---
Wouldn't say anyone is a "shill" for complimenting the art team. They do great work.
---
 Game systems sucking isn't on them and it's unfair to bring that negativity on the artists.
---
iirc one of the only classes that can debuff a enrage also.
---
if you have a friend then go for it, you two will have fun figuring things out along the way, the best thing about classic/vanilla is that you can play it more casually and not feel left behind like in retail WoW, I highly recommend giving it a try, if the difficulty and grind won't burn you out too fast you're in for quite a ride, leveling in WoW classic is quite the adventure.
---
I switched with a guild of 200+ the new servers are already medium haha

Low effort? I think not.
---
NOCHANGES
---
As soon as I typed that out, I knew you were going to say lol. See ya in Brill!
---
Well, I hope they can fix it till launch.
---
I reupped by sub about 20 minutes ago, no hiccups....
---
Oh man when i be sometime in the us i just will be in the nature and eating at every fast food restaurant because i think wendys doesnt even exist in germany (maybe in a big city)
---
It’s still a weird and annoying circlejerk, with weird “slurs”.
---
FORKNIFE BAD
---
Yeah... its just the beginning. Tonight is gonna be a shit show.
---
Blizzard ran out of game time.  They're hoping to get their next shipment before Halloween but no promises because game time harvests are notoriously unreliable.
---
That's ok. leave the gaming for the people who planned for this lol
---
Ordinarily, yes.. but how many people do you think will be logging off per second? not many xD
---
They're not "very low dps". They'll be pretty competitive on the charts up to BWL and Naxx.
---
Doesn't make it any less cool
---
Just add Westfall, redridge, duskwood, ashenvale, hillsbrad, thousand needles, svt, desolace, dustwallow, alterac, badlands, swamp of sorrows, tanaris, feralas, hinterlands, searing gorge, blasted lands, westen plaguelands, felwood and burning steppes to that list and youll be around level 50 :)
---
Are you doing these for all professions?   
---
Would be interested in Tailoring, maybe enchanting but definitely tailoring!
---
love the site, thanks a bunch!
---
I mean yeah, being a huge streamer of wow to get your priority in the queue is the ultimate prep
---
making and seelling engineering items may be profitable when people dont feel like collecting ores or making stufff on their own
---
14k barely scraping 15k- and they even had a pve server
---
Psh those are amateur hours.
---
Winter is coming = Players are coming. The Blizzard team what they are thinking at this right time.
---
Yeah I can't leave work until 5pm CST at the earliest. Makes me happy I didnt waste a day off for launch
---
Your post got removed 10 minutes ago for breaking and now you repost it?
---
Also heard that one going into my PhD. Been told that my professors and doctorate holders alike.
---
Only because there aren’t any popular elves in mainstream media right now.
---
No its if
---
Even better! I’m super excited to hope on and try this out.
---
I definitely had no clear plan before so this is perfect and keeps me efficient at leveling.  Thanks again !
---
I'm quite sure that still how it works, warlock spell + 2 other people can summon.
---
Lmao Eastrise is great.
---
I tried playing it, got to level like 114 and stopped. Just couldn't anymore. It just wasn't wow anymore. I played legion well after it came out and it was ok, but also wasn't wow to me. It had become a hack and slash loot fest game anymore.
---
Not really man, just shows that they're very close
---
This is pretty standard for Blizzard tbh. Got the same issue but should've known better and bought it sooner.
---
And if it’s always long q’s?
---
Warlocks could summon from within a Dungeon/Raid in TBC, iirc.  Definitely not in Vanilla, they have to run out.
---
That’s some quick leveling
---
Show me on the doll where the ocean hurt you
---
In the launcher there is a little connection symbol next to your name and it says they're working on the issue.
---
Don’t act like this isn’t a masterpiece
---
It's not just you. They are working on it but there are no guarantees that it will work tonight. 
---
Imagine some people at Blizzard are not happy with this though. That's a lot of $$ to miss out.
---
&gt;girlfriend left for China to teach English and never heard from her again
---
Lol what? Like one day she was literally just "leaving for China now u/synystar, will miss you talk to you when the plane lands xoxo" and you never heard from her again? What the hell..
---
Had to resurrect it because the school computers didn’t let me download the Battle.net app lol
---
Simple, alliance isn't able to use ragefire chasm as dungeon, unless they die their way through there which really isn't worth it.
---
Deadmines and shadowfang are both reachable for the other faction yes, although of course as a horde player you can expect many alliance players near the deadmines and visa versa. Of course it also takes a bit of running since it's a bit off from the nearest flight point for the other faction.
---
Is there a shortcut the other way for us gnomes wanting to ride cats?
---
Why would I save them for AQ ?
---
&gt;  to get your priority in the queue is the ultimate prep
---
Citation?
---
Come to incendius
---
Imagine throwing away money to waste game time lul
---
Also speaking as someone in a medical program (BSN) they don't. Perhaps your educate is more lax, but at my university we're required to achieve and maintain a B average or better in order to be accepted into the program, and STAY in the program.
---
That's awesome - tear it up man!
---
Its not YOUR name. Its A name. Its sad people can't figure this out.
---
It is to me. And who cares? If you care to argue so much about it, then why don’t you take it to trade chat :p
---
Yes, this is the WoW I remember
---
Yea that was absolute bullshit. I wanted to play one of them, then they announced that and I was like wtf, fuck you Blizzard.
---
Ive also never played wow, from my understanding its geared towards casual play, and leveling 1-60 takes a decent amount of time (world record is 116 hours). It should be enjoyable for both casual and hardcore players.
---
as for a beginners guide I would listen to https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE (hour long) for a nice overview of classes and race
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/4mkoMQO4EP4) is the first part in another beginners guide which I also found useful.
---
Blizz still thinks classic will die off in a few months so I don’t think that’s what they are thinking
---
Nope, same here :S
---
TILL YOU DIE!
---
Durrr ya think?
---
Not sure why anyone would bother with it when there's plenty of great free ones available.
---
Personally, I think Classic is *more* accessible in a lot of ways than retail.
---
Internal consistency of the world is a big part.  If you come into retail now, depending on the location and level you're in, you could have any of three different Warchiefs on the Horde side; the Lich King may or may not still be ravaging Azeroth; Dalaran could be in either of two (maybe still three? not sure) places; portals suddenly appear that weren't there before; Deathwing may or may not have just wrecked Azeroth... It's confusing as fuck, and I've been more or less keeping up with the story the whole time.  It's completely opaque and overwhelming for a new player.
---
Classic doesn't have this issue.  Yes, it's huge and deep and complex, but it's at least mostly internally consistent, and teaches you the most important pieces of what you need to know.
---
I'd say give it a shot.  If you like it, great; if not, no harm no foul.
---
As of right now it's only at Medium. But good luck!
---
Quick, clear visual indicator of whether or not you're attacking in your peripheral view.
---
This sub is literally nothing but posts that break the rules. Kinda annoying
---
First week will be rough. All of the people who have never played classic will be dissuaded by then
---
COMPLETE MADNESS
---
I took two days off and explained the situation to my wife. I owe a big favor, but I am completely free of responsibility (minus a few hours with the kids every day, of course) until Monday.
---
As the kids say nowadays, it's about to be on like Donkey Kong. I just have to get to bed at a decent hour on Sunday because life calls, and all that.
---
bubble hearth?
---
I'm already planning my leveling routes! I'm at least a decade ahead of the pack!
---
And? I think its funny, so idc what you think lmao
---
I think the majority of people in this sub will be playing rather than watching people play. 
---
I mean no offense, but the last thing people here want to do is watch a stranger play WoW for the first time.
---
why are the chat timestamp on the wrong side?
---
To get early rep for an actual good-looking mount on a gnome/dwarf. :)
---
[I think you're forgetting about something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCHHrDWzbjY)
---
I'm most definitely rolling on PVE, spent to much time on Pservers and got burned out getting ganked all the time and STV being basically locked out from a questing perspective.  With that said I'm going to see what servers are available tomorrow with lower populations so I can actually get in :)  
---
Good luck to you though, fellow Dad!
---
shazzrah is the one with dumb Spaniards Ive heard
---
It has done me well for 15 years
---
Wildstar wasn’t horrible just launched in a time of glut in the market. FF is good if you actually like story and want to experience it, same for ESO. If you want good and more active pvp I’d say ESO because tab targeting is ass and belongs in 2005 but that’s just me lol.
---
A lot of it depends on what you’re looking for tbh.
---
MMOs as a genre is shifting due to its own popularity and the changing player base. Our generation of mmo gamers are older and more set in what we are looking for but younger generations don’t really want that grindy bullshit that we had, they want to experience things much sooner which is at odds with our generation, hence classic.
---
From a purely objective standpoint, WoW didn’t offer anything at launch that wasn’t in EW or other mmos except for more Warcraft. They didn’t innovate anything or originate anything at all, but the nostalgia goggles will say otherwise. That isn’t today classic wasn’t good. It was a solid 7/10 easily enough, but it wasn’t the best mmo ever like people in this sub Reddit make it out to be
---
Fake but I would love to see blizz get it handed to them bad enough to delay launch
---
I got Chad on Bigglesworth :P
---
In related news there wasn't any available discord for the server so i went ahead and made one. 
---
https://discord.gg/xK7TNkw
---
I have experience running large discord servers and grew a steam group from 0-600+ people so everything should run smoothly. Roles and classes are already be setup and it should feel like the other discords!
---
Some of us respect the law. You know, one of the fundamental pillars of our society.
---
Tony Tony Chopper
---
Yeah, but people are thinking the 10 alts people make per server at counting. It’s 1 toon per account per server counts.
---
I think you're right, and I'm hoping they launch new servers right away.  I get home right around when the servers go live and don't really want to play on a full realm.  It would also be nice to have a prayer of a chance at a few character names I want!
---
If you are trying to get to IF or SW this is the fastest way to get there.
---
The Indian guy on the other end probably didn't even know what you were talking about.
---
Honestly a huge portion of this sub has been nothing but bitching and crying and asking for shit. I hope it doesn't taint the "sociology" of the servers. Complaining and outrage are a recreational sport for some people. I'm just waiting to play muh game.
---
What game is that? I waited 15 years for this release...
---
Nah man it unlocked soon 2 hours ago.
---
Titan Panel is a godsend.

I will be supprised if more than 5% of the people who play today bitch about queue times. This sub alone has 200 000+ people and you will be hard pressed to find many posts over 1000 comments.
---
Not likely that there will be that much latency; remember that classic was originally played on 56k modems with 100+ ping reliably.
---
you can always check a live server with the same datacenter though!
---
Get them to play so they get addicted
---
I stopped watching after the first season finalie. With the robot devil's hands hands and homer phone thing?  If I want to continue, where would I go from?
---
Yeah, its just that first journey low lvls may not wanna do
---
Aren't you guys getting sick of pretending that specs like spriests and ret paladins don't get to raid yet?
---
human warrior always for pve. extra mace and sword skill is the most OP tanking racial in the game. prevents glancing blows against level 63 bosses. gnome perhaps better for pvp however with escape artist. but in the case of PVP all horde have vastly superior racials.

Luck.
---
Generally, 
---
Tailoring is considered Best if you plan to PvE
---
However some people plan to take tailoring to start, then drop it, then pick it back up in later phases.
---
Engineering is considered Best if you plan to PvP, or Try hard speed run PvE, and spend resources to secure more victories.
---
(it can be an expensive way to win, or it could be a waste if you never manage your trinkets/helm according to what your doing, and your too tight with your gold to use the grenades, bombs, and sappers.)
---
So the cookie cutter is Tailoring + Engineering.
---
Herbalism, Alchemy can be done by dedicated alts. The only downside is now you've commited yourself to farming on an alt. Some would rather just farm gold with the warloc, and buy the potions/herbs directly.
---
Disenchanting, works fine on an alt. However you won't be able to disenchant Old Gear and BoP gear.  so you'll just have to vendor that stuff instead. This also means you won't be able to enchant your mains Bound gear, and you'll need to find an enchanter with the chant you need and trade mats + tip to get your own gear enchanted.
---
Personally I think enchanting works best on Rogues (open lock box), or mages (portals, Food, water) since there are no vellums, you want a character that already has a reason to stand around in town spamming /Trade with wares for sale.
---
Sounds like you had a decent balance. I am more so referring to people who are going to be shut-ins playing 18 hours a day. By all means play video games in college just make sure you go and meet people, network, socialize, party, study, and everything else as well.
---
Why would that make any sense
---
I googled "how many people have died in the past 15 years", made a few clicks, and decided that was too morbid for me.
---
Buying a host plan and uploading your server's files, easy, maybe 5 minutes to a couple hours depending on how organized you are.
---
Updating your DNS servers to point, easy, maybe an hour to a few days depending on who controls the DNS (ie could require waiting on someone who actually has the account), how easy it is to update (i've had really bad experiences with shit hosts before), how fast it propagates (shouldn't take too long, but it can still take a day), etc...
---
So ideally you can get it done quickly, but it's very easy to add a ton of time if you weren't prepared for it.
---
*screaming intensifies*
---
Why shouldn't it be easy to replace wankers ruining the game for me and the others in the group? 
---
Why should one arsehole cost me and 3 other people an hour of our game time?
---
I'm starting to think you're the scrub who knows they cant reallybplay the game and will be kicked so you are doing everything you van to force other to put up with you
---
Bad idea. Imagine the servers launch 1 minute late. Then you are at the back of the queue
---
You remember correctly. 
---
WoW used to have its own sign in system. A few years later, Blizzard used Battle.net as the single sign on for all their games.
---
You had to merge your WoW account(s) into a Battle.net account. So while the service was around way before WoW, it wasn't the global sign in system until later.
---
Coffee. Always coffee.

Thanks, I tried 8 different things prior to this. Resolved my issue.

blizz having similar problems in 2019 just like they did in 2004

I dont understand why people think these launch numbers are going to stay that way lol. Yeah we'll have queues this week, but definitely not by the end of the month.
---
It's accounts.  You can't play more than one character at a time.
---
thats risky, i would do it at 45min
---
League is retail wow
---
DoTA is classic wow
---
Let me know if you see a streamer sit in a queue longer than a few minutes and tell me there isn’t one
---
don't use ` instead of '. it breaks formatting.
---
I hired maids to clean.
---
Yeah what is kul tiras and how did no one in vanilla seem to know it was *right there*?

Or an AGP 8x ATI Radeon card. I forgot which one I had but instead of a fan it had this monster heatsink brick that took up like 2-3 card slots and made the card sag

Alliance PvP - Herod
---
Gnome Mage
---
I'm a relatively new player (started in Pandaria) that absolutely loves this game. I've been prepping for classic over the last six months by learning on a private server and doing a good bit of reading into classic mechanics and class guides for mages. I'm in college currently so I'll have a good bit of time to dedicate to this game, and can raid nights almost any day of the week (not Tuesdays or Thursdays). 
---
I'm looking for a raiding guild as I've never truly been a part of a raid experience. Although I'm new, I'm ready to spend time learning and becoming an excellent player and guild raider. please let me know if you think id be a good fit for your guild!
---
I’m using a sell price addon, a fast loot addon, and a debut addon (and an immersion quest addon but I’ll turn it off for my first character)
---
And then you run into that damned lvl 20 orc blocking the mountain tunnel.
---
LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
you can click the name on chat, dear.
---
I'm jealous of you and my younger brother, being able to experience wow for the first time is an amazing opportunity, more so for my younger brother as it will be the first mmorpg he tries.
---
I've been a bit confused by it all-- I've been putzing around the login for an hour now without being logged out.
---
Same for white.
---
Silly social stigma prob had her feeling like that was somehow the normal expected reaction.
---
Seriously, all the new PvP realms are already full....
---
"The OG" has put hundreds of hours of effort into helping people, if people feel like supporting him then by definition he earned it.
---
He also spent much time recently writing a whole alliance guide hes not just living off his work he did many many years ago.

According to the Reddit poll, Mograine has the most English speaking players and almost a 50:50 faction balance.
---
I'd choose Mograine. Population is high, but not that overcrowded as Shazzrah.
---
How many new servers do you think they will open today or tomorrow??
---
Lol. 
---
It’s actually probably just one person who’s bad thinking about it now
---
Pservers shut themselves down, only a few will remain.
---
Yup in India nobody has ever heard of WoW, particularly not people who work in tech /s
---
Since it goes live in 3 hours the info I had is outdated at this point but it was the V4 census data.
---
Your boss is a monster. Who schedules an interview at 5pm???
---
so Im not the only cheapskate waiting for the last moment
---
I used to play Magic the Gathering with a group of guys between classes back in my college days. One day one of them stopped showing up, I asked where he was. Apparently he had been skipping class to play MTG with us, and it got him kicked out of school altogether.
---
So, ya know.. mileage may vary.

Ive been playing alliance for 15 years..want a chnage of scenario.

If i have some low minute queues its ok

We are Hostile, a World of Warcraft Classic Alliance guild on the Old Blanchy realm. We are an old Vanilla guild from Tortheldrin with many players returning for classic. We have many realm seconds through TBC. Our guild aims to be a raid focused that will progress from Molten Core through Naxxramas.
---
Conduct:
---
We want @everyone in our guild to have fun and enjoy themselves while playing World of Warcraft Classic. 1. Don't be a dick 2. Have fun

Attendance for Guild Events: For scheduled events, all players are expected to be on time and ready to go. Please give yourself 10-15 minutes to travel Please let an officer or the organizing member know if you will be running late or unable to attend by posting in the #afk-channel.
---
In the event that you fail to complete prerequisite content before an event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to remove you from the group and bring in someone else. Similarly, if you are more than 10 minutes late to a guild event, the organizer and/or officers have the right to start the event without you and not permit you to join after the fact. Consistently signing up for events and showing up late is considered a violation of guild rules.
---
Non-members are allowed to attend guild events; however, eligible guild members will receive invites at a priority.
---
Our main focus in this guild is on PVE. That means that the majority of our events will focus on Dungeons and Raids.
---
Loot Policy: DKP System with Role Priority:
---
Fairness and Consistency Reward regular attendance Relatively even distribution Pieces going to roles / specs that will benefit from them most at a priority Alternates for raids if there is a 40 man full raid - you continue to get DKP for being online and able to step in at a moments notice There will be very minimal reservation of specific pieces - Thunderfury going to where it will offer the greatest benefit to the entire raid, as an example.
---
Reminder: These are just high-level guidelines and things are subject to change as we work to iron out the full policy. Officers

Officers are appointed on leadership capability, trust, and MMO experience. Officers are like the other members of the guild, and should not be treated any differently. Similarly, officers are expected to follow the rules. If you have any issues with an officer, please notify another officer and we can look into the problem for you. We want everyone to have a fun and enjoyable experience! Please let us know if you feel we can do better in this regard.

Theyre moving to firemaw it seems. Some of them
---
I wish I had the college experience people like this somehow had, lol. I have tons more free time now than I did in college and I'm just happy I'm not in school any more so I can actually have time for WoW.
---
Thanks I wasn’t aware of that.
---
shut the fuck up
---
Guessing here, but it's probably just the way it's rounding and based on what exact time you looked at the estimate.  Servers open at 5:00 pm central.
---
TIL "majority" and "only" are interchangeable.
---
This is absolute gold hahaha
---
Nope they wont this was just some bait by some shazzrah guys in hope the spaniards would leave.. they debunked this info on their discords
---
I see where the Horde could setup chokepoints.
---
Those damn veggies at it again I see!
---
[The Nicker] , [Slavedriver's Cane] , [Black Menace] in chat doesn't ring any bells?
---
i have my old pc setup in my sons room, he thinks its for him little does he know its a classic wow backup pc.
---
Don't be mean to Crabby! He didn't do anything to you.
---
Good luck
---
But they can use potions with macros in the current version of classic.
---
Everyone’s pissed at blizzard and not at themselves for waiting literally hours before classic releases to resub
---
Me too. I deleted Fortnite two days after season 10 and I'm glad that in a few hours, I'll have Classic to fill the gap that Fortnite left :)
---
God speed Blizz
---
LOL 😁
---
If the group that responded before I did doesn't work out, we have a semi-serious guild that is intent on progression that your schedule sounds like about half of our members.  If you want to, give me a shout and I can give you more information.
---
True but as utility the best in slot gear is based around you being able to go bear and snag whelps as easily as you pop tranquility, ennervate a healer, or cleanse a curse.
---
Definitively high demand for Classic launch
---
When I made my first toons I tried to log into Grob and it made me a char on some other server instead. I dont think you got your chars on Mankrik :/
---
Looks like it might be warrior too then :) didn’t know RE: Windfury.
---
110%
---
&gt;Any non-oily vegetables (like Avocado)  
---
80% of the calories in avocado is from fat. How is it non-oily?
---
It is going to change into sub-only mode soon:
---
" Starting from 27th August, all WoW Classic sections will require an active subscription or game time to post in."

[Source](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-forum-changes-incoming/74824)
---
If you want to do end-game content, more or less. There’s no matchmaking system for the raids, so you would need to know a ton of people to get into one. The alternative is asking to join one in a general chat channel, but generally raids with a bunch of random people don’t work too well (LFR works in retail WoW because it’s a much easier version of the raid)
---
its a great movie if you are a warcraft fan
---
I 2as going to level a mage this time around, but god I just love Warlock and the whole aesthetic. It's just really fun, I don't care if it's super easy, I just want to play what I like
---
it was good fun for me, if you dont take everything way too serious.
---
also orks are a treat to look at
---
&gt; What would it take for you to buy into a balancing patch?
---
F R E S H server without the balance patch.
---
I'm thankful to be having class until 9pm est. Most players wont be able to play at 6pm anyways.
---
A lot of guilds will bring one feral tank. Some won't bring any. Almost noone will bring more than one.
---
Feral tank is fine, it's just behind warriors in general. There's a few fights throughout vanilla where it's better for a druid to tank, so it pays off to keep one in the guild.
---
cap your framerate
---
Iirc you could put different windfury ranks on your weapons while dual wielding.
---
Yeah, vegetation? I assume a tree on powerlines or something? But it does sound like the electric company just lost a fight with a particularly aggressive cabbage . . .
---
Sure, they are care about people. I bet they all gona play wow so no one will work for at least a week
---
as long as he is on at least macOS 10.11 and meets the minimum system requirements
---
Oh god, that's our ISP haha o.o

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvsu57/my_boi_gettin_ready_for_classic_wow/). 
---
FYI just because people find entertainment in something that you don't, doesn't mean they are deluded. It just means they have different opinions or preferences.
---
$15 is virtually nothing. I can guarantee I would spend more money on a f2p game than I will on one that has a monthly fee but no microtransactions. It's literally like the price of eating at a fast food restaurant. If that is a deterrent to you, then feel free to go elsewhere and play some shitty ~~f2p~~ p2w shitfest.
---
Also, you're calling Classic a cash grab when Blizzard refused to do it until the community demanded it of them. That makes zero sense. Oh and by the way, f2p games are the definition of cash grabs.
---
This is the kind of high quality of meme I've been waiting for.
---
Highly possible!
---
That's how it works.  If a guy does not do what they want.. prepare to pay the price until you give in 😔
---
I'm bummed by this. Asmongold is a huge tool. The first stream I ever saw of him playing warcraft, he talked enough to be the party leader yet didn't know any of the strategies and was often wrong. He also tried to shame his party members when they did the right thing by not listening to him.
---
thats the best one of these i've seen
---
I took work off today to be part of the shitshow..there is only once chance to be part of wow classic launch
---
What you get for buying it last minute
---
I think that's a fair idea!
---
They are instantly gone.
---
However you can, hit create Character, get everything set exactly correct, then cancel creation.
---
Delete the character with the name, hit create, then select the Race and gender, and 90% of the time it will be exactly like your cancelled configuration.   Unless same race and gender was choosen randomly to default character creation.
---
Is there a paladin build that let’s you tank dungeons and heal raids without respeccing?
---
Dueling MMR is an interesting idea, but how would you integrate bets?
---
So you know, you will get unsolicited invitations to join other guilds when you play a dwarf priest and probably showered with loot slightly more often, but in no way will not choosing dwarf inhibit your ability to play in the end game. Learn how to play the class well and you will be invited everywhere as a healer.
---
Is that a US server?
---
I can confirm I uninstalled retail and classic still works
---
Just don't be addicted noob
---
Should have subbed earlier
---
Ok I had the same problem and I fixed it, you don't need a subscription to see, you need to download about 2-3gb of Retail WoW before you can see classic, login to Retail when it's playable then quit it and it should appear.
---
Where does the data get stored ?
---
can I just edit my addons setting with a text file and write that I won't 1000 duels and lost none ?
---
Thank you private servers &lt;3
---
My physical therapy program (doctorate in US) requires B's or better in all classes. If you get a B- once you are held back a year unless it's in anatomy in which you can retake it while also completing full time clinical work. If you get two B- then you are kicked out. If you get below a 75 on an exam you can retake a single exam a semester, if you get below a 75 twice in a semester or 3 times in the 3 year doctoral program than you are out. If you score below a 80 on any lab exam you fail. Did I mention that we have 20-23 credit hour semesters with medical school classes? Don't go to grad school kids.
---
College is basically adult daycare. I got very little value out of school other than it got me the connections needed to find a job that I am posting on reddit from.
---
Hahahaha fucking izzard. Lol. I don't hate retail (it's not my cup of tea but I don't hate it) but I get a wonderful feeling of schadenfreude whenever I see classic doing well and I know the smug fat-cats and shit-head developers at Blizzard have to choke in their words like so many throbbing lice-balls.
---
The better Classic does the more I want to call up those baselessly overconfident shit-fucks and rub it in their stupid faces. 
---
I've watched a lot of Invader Zim lately.... but I swear I've felt like this ever since they started catering to the whiny babies who said shit like "it's not mfair that my class can't ___ but class Y can!" and "much balance!" and all that shit
---
What spec is the priest?
---
Was waiting for someone to share this!  Glad I saw it before the admin voted it too low effort
---
Alliance, I had a 60 NE Hunter and a 58 NE rogue. Kozmirian and Jilt.i was in  aeon,vindictive and requiem
---
lemme know if this works.  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0fHnbNZew9dHdg6l9xGB7zcvcp39B7b/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0fHnbNZew9dHdg6l9xGB7zcvcp39B7b/view) 
---
holy moly i got alot of messages lol
---
My friend and I are doing rogues.
---
&gt;  Its your choice to be offended. Not mine. You can choose to not be offended
---
Nope, I choose to be offended.
---
Still fuck you.
---
Let me know if you think that’s true in 3 hours
---
I'm thinking Linkin Park Hybrid Theory, Bon Jovi, Soad. Still in the works. Prob gonna throw on some new stuff with the old. Like Solway Firth, Fear Inoculum and Probably Cold/You'll Never Find Me. Slipknot, Tool and Korn respectively. A lot of classic songs will be played though. Some disturbed songs as well.
---
Ya I don't get the hate.  I was in college when I started playing wow.  Basically worked my school schedule around it.
---
Now that I'm married with a career it doesn't work like that any longer, take advantage you young punks.
---
I think double rogue will be good for one thing. PvP. Other than PvP, gearing... which requires questing dungeons ect.... will be hard.
---
[Atlas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17LOFBTkH0R5StNiutoF6PG0gMN3IzqvL/view) has a fanmade patch
---
For a bag addon I used [Inventorian](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/inventorian) during the stress test and it worked.
---
For gathering I went with [GathererMate2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gathermate2/files/2760340) since it has the most downloads.  None of them seems to have a pre-populated database so if they have node sharing ingame then the addon that most people use will probably be the best.
---
Luckily so. Just bought gametime right before the crash and created characters. Sadly will only be able to play few hours after launch. Hopefully no more queues then.
---
So immersive

Just put in the work. Figure out power shifting, gear you need, how to farm MCPs and what consumables you need for raiding. You have time. You got this.
---
Thed faction thing so hard! I'm leveling a horde char with my spouse, but sorta want to go alliance for me but probably should go horde to support  our characters and gah, it's a lot
---
Hello, I want to play a Druid Healer and as there are no multiple Specs i have to go for Damage to level at an fast rate right? 
---
The Question is am i able to heal Dungeons if i go :  14/31/5  Talents? I got that recommendation in a Youtube Video.
---
Thank you for your answers already!
---
I'm gunna play both. I hate BfA, but I still love retail. Classic will be a very welcome distraction until the next expansion release.
---
And if the next expac sucks, Classic is still there for me.
---
Pfft, I’m sitting here waiting for UPS to drop off my computer, brand new peripherals, first time using Microsoft OS in about a decade. Wish me luck fellas.
---
All the workers for the maintenence called in sick to play
---
What’s fights, out of interest? Is resto any good?

Don’t mind this guy he just has a bad sense of direction.

⚡ LATE NIGHT RAIDING ⚡
---
📋 Guild: &lt;Dominatus&gt; \[H\] \[Arugal\]
---
🌄 Time Zone: GMT+ 10
---
⌚ Raid times:  10:00pm - 1:30am Mon/Weds/Thurs (+ Sunday as a reserve night if needed)
---
📝 Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
🎲 Loot: EPGP/council
---
🔎 Info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA/SEA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players.
---
📥 Applicants:  Applicants: Vanilla raiding experience is preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear, raid attendence etc).

It's either blue cheese with Roast Quail or go fuck your mother!
---
Druids are perfectly fine, maybe even better at tanking 5-mans than warriors.
---
In raids, though, they're limited to being offtanks for the most part.
---
I fully trust you have everything in preparation. armor kits applied, weapons sharpened, flasked up.
---
just think of traffic on the 10 as a "practice queue"
---
\*act natural\*
---
You will want to watch the 4 movies in order: Benders Big Score - Beast with a Billion Backs - Benders Game - Into the Wild Green Yonder.  These were broken up into 30 minute episodes to air on TV and make up season 5.  After that, just watch season 6 on.
---
Bottom right, for sure gonna happen
---
Heavy Metal in there. You an UD player? :D
---
Yep. Launch night at Fry's in Irvine California.
---
More information to explain why:
---
Protection warriors are the only ones who can avoid 100% of crushing blows.  This is a huge factor in starting a raid level.  Even if you are fully geared from Molten core, this will pop up for Black Wing Lair and again at AQ/Naxx.  Crushing blows are 150% normal damage.  Protection warriors avoid these by stacking % block.  Paladins can reach this point but have to rely on procs from talents instead of just using skills.
---
Kings honour friend!
---
It actually means that trees knocked down the power lines.
---
Hey bro, you probably would have struggled to get on straight away anyway. So enjoy your night, it'll be here for you when you get back!
---
I cringe at the idea that these are the people I’ll be playing with
---
should have got your game time yesterday
---
Same, webpage is down it keeps telling me, shouldn't have waited until the last second to sub really
---
Big oof
---
I loved the office while it was running, but I haven't even seen the finale. Those episodes after Michael leaves are so rough and I just never went back to it.
---
Oooh, I'd forgotten about Dead Night Elf Priestess Highway.
---
I’m kinda a noob, does it take a lot of leather to craft a mount at 40?
---
I have a name with king in it and I didn't have any issues reserving it.
---
It kicks you off after 30 minutes. So... you want to get to the character select sometime 30 minutes before it goes live.
---
Warlock. From the sounds of it. Dotting multiple enemies up at a time should speed things up for you.
---
&gt; people that drink a cup of coffee before going to bed
---
I'm pretty sure that messes with your sleep cycle really hard.
---
Draft all the browns and you'll be set ;)
---
Y'all are thinking way too small. The real secret is to tag team the chores and yardwork so you AND your spouse can suffer through the launch queues together!
---
I believe free time is based on whether your wife lets you play games (women telling you what to do), have a very high demand job or so much shit on your plate you shouldn't even attempt to play games.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Let’s break these servers boys!
---
You're an angel.  He's lucky.  My wife is tolerant, but not nearly to your agree of supportive.
---
still medium after a couple of hours
---
Are we in /r/wowcirclejerk here?
---
Water, Celery and peanut butter &gt; mtn dew and doritos.
---
And I started a Warlock in classic, but I ditched it for a friend so we could play Rogues together. Never actually played Warlock since then aside from a quickly leveled Warlock during the pre Legion invasion event.
---
I'm finally allowing myself the pleasure of being a Warlock.
---
Should have waited 5m longer to post this, number 1 now.
---
Ya
---
I've never heard of you until now, but I want to know more. Or is there a youtube video or anything I can watch to learn about your awesomeness
---
Being a college kid during vanilla allowed you to play non-stop. YOUR words, not mine.
---
YOU took it to the extreme, and your post is enabling and just all around terrible advice.
---
ooh, thanks man! Bank alt ready for launch :)
---
He talked about something specific though. Not like punching random people in the face you disagree with about coffee or smth.
---
Why do all these numpties wait until the very last minute to get everything setup.
---
It's like $15-20/month, as if subbing a week early will break the bank lol.
---
You have nobody to blame but yourself.
---
Busty*
---
People, this is worth it. We waited until the night before to let them know that this money is for Classic World of Warcraft, not the shite that now taints it name. I'll wait as long as it takes. Do you feel that, server? I hope you do. Classic is coming.
---
not as much as asmon only because asmon is a consistent streamer and kungen has been out of the game for a while. once kungen starts back up he'll get some good numbers, still nowhere near what asmon will get though
---
Live draft? Don’t miss out dude. You can level up tonight.  
---
Also who live drafts on a wed my guy?
---
Imagine having your systems crash because too many people want to pour their money in
---
No, not really.  It's not like the executive board of Arby's were sitting at a long table insidiously thinking of ways to exploit classic wow as a way to sell roast beef sandwiches.
---
Arby's social media manager probably plays wow him/herself and whipped this graphic up in a few minutes and posted it because wow is nostalgic to the person who created the graphic
---
As her subordinate you can’t consent. Sorry bro
---
Usually, yes, but Lyse is one of the few corporations I actually like. They charge me $30 for a 500/500 fibre that has yet to fail me yet (uptime for 4 years now).
---
Play druid! It's All the classes in one!
---
&gt;BC launched. All that gear became obsolete.
---
I never could remember why i quit after vanilla ended but i think this was it. I think being burnt out/having the gear become useless made me quit.
---
OP 6 months from now:
---
&gt;can't wait to start raiding!
---
We are rolling on Firemaw, Shazzrah is way too high pop and the community looks pretty cancerous! if you decide to roll on firemaw give me a whisper ingame (jazzper)!
---
Absolutely same here!
---
"accidentally made an entire cheesecake"
---
Did you mean to only make half of one?
---
Same, it’s the shortest I’ve ever played a wow expansion.  It just wasn’t for me.
---
Yes and he is still very active updating it and answering questions on discord
---
Glad you enjoyed the face! I love all the dumb memes classic has brought us

---
I'm just starting 6am Tuesday. Cba being tired for this launch. Got a week off, it's not worth feeling crap the first day.
---
Also true
---
I can't 100% confirm this for classic but if you have a character name when the server goes live it might lock to your account for 30 days. So I'd you are hoping to trade them to guildies after servers go up, you might not be able too
---
I used the word programmers to also cover people who could make a desktop application. Say something that looks exactly like the LFD/Premade finder on live and you Q in it then it spits out a string you copypaste into chat to invite your bros
---
Told my summer job I was going back a week early. I have a full week to play. My last summer since I’m a senior so I fucking feel this. Very grateful this came out now. Cheers to my future fellow working man
---
I did the run on a pserver cause my friends were humans
---
Contact support
---
I mean... I for one get the Classic hype and I really hope that the people who are going to play it have the best time. I for one will be joining you as a little side project when I'm bored in the main game! 
---
I just don't want this to be a divide my experience of the main game. I enjoy the main game truly, it's a lot more fast paced and the casual aspects (up to heroic and mid level M+) are good for me on a limited time scale. 
---
Just... Can we please be respectful of both sides? I mean one isn't better than the other as, in my opinion, it's like their totally different games and the reasons people play are personal 😊
---
TLDR: Have fun everyone and don't shit on either side because of it 😊
---
Two of the PvP realms in Europe is already medium population. After 2-3 hours. The notion that new servers are dead is stupid.
---
Here's me making my characters on most realms about 2 hours ago.
---
[Europe realms at 20:00](https://i.imgur.com/WfVHCMc.jpg) I think that's 8 PM IN 12 hour format.
---
Faeraline is the streamer server
---
... to WAAAAAGH!
---
Ah wait, wrong Greenskins.
---
Thanks :) I'm not going to use Dragonborn, if anyone wants it I'll just give it away
---
Alterac Valley is supposedly going to be a later version. Between when it took literal days and when it started being doable in 20 minutes. So it'll be long and tough but it seems we won't see the multiple day AVs of yore.
---
"Hah! Gaaaaaaay"
---
Eric was in the finale. He came in at the end.
---
Why comment something like this? To belittle him? Isn't his fault. Fuck off dude lol
---
Paladins were kinda ruff in vanilla. Does kinda suck that the factions have unique classes, but it makes it interesting i guess.
---
Man I fucking hated that run.  I remember seeing the Raptors and after leveling in NE zones I was like 'WTF are those?!"
---
Gotta love the MAGA hat, perfectly displayed just to piss people off. He knows what he is doing. 
---
Well it worked for me, and he can fuck off.
---
They can add as many servers as they want.  The hard part is making sure none of them die.
---
And I only hear about this now!
---
do you know the best way to do this?
---
Has your friend had a sub before? If you’ve never subbed you have to sub first.
---
You owe your wife a favor for taking two earned days off your job? Yikes
---
Go back to tiktok
---
Thalnos is where BR and French Canadians are playing I believe
---
Dude I'm in the exact same situation as you.
---
Same experience man, only it was in the quad. Two hours!
---
Dwarf for alliance, Undead for Horde!
---
I think i've done it before but I will definitely try it again lol
---
nelfs have warrior trainers yeah
---
Why not priest? They level really smoothly. Another option is Druid. The also level super efficient, maybe even 2nd best after Hunter. Mage or Shaman are good too (for what you want). I know everyone is gonna say pIcK a pEt cLaSs fOr SoLo but there are a lot of non pet classes that level up solo fairly well and are fun to play. I love leveling up on a shadow priest..idk why its just satisfying.
---
It's AT&amp;T
---
Everything is viable, but not everything is optimal.
---
I'll be missing tomorrow night to meet with my weekly D&amp;D group.  Been friends with that crew for over 20 years for some of the members.  I'm more excited for Classic than I have been for anything in a long, long time, but IRL friendships are still more important.  Azeroth isn't going anywhere this time around.
---
Have you ever hit the 1TB soft cap ?
---
goto their website
---
Hopefully not after you lost your name!
---
¿Cualo?
---
It already was 5 mins ago
---
Would this mean if you failed to get in you'd be timed out almost immediately (since you were "afk" for 29 mins~ beforehand) and be sent to the back of the queue?
---
So you won't know the game is dead until the game is dead?
---
Some of us don't know where we'll ultimately end up.  I'm going to reserve a name that I'm happy with on all the PVP servers.  Sorry if that impacts your ability to decide.
---
Customer service has refunded my game time many times before when I have forgot to unsub. They can see the last time you logged in. So I would message them. 
---
You will need to make a new account on the EU side and then add time to it.
---
Man I forgot all about Jonathan Coulton.
---
I hate drafts that are before the last preseason game. At least Luck retired before yours so no one will have a wasted that pick
---
WE ARE NUMBER ONE!
---
Hey give them a little credit. They did end up coming around on this.
---
You definitely missed some good expansions. BC and WOTLK. WoD was not the best to return to! Lol
---
Oh... I just reactivated my account yesterday and made my 3 characters .... and that’s the server I picked cause it’s an EST one..., fuck
---
More chair than man now
---
Bahahaha
---
I personally recommend a mage as a starting class; you're squishy, but you are able to dish out a lot of damage at once (depending on your specialization) so combat is rather straight-forward.
---
Screenshot?
---
It is 100% absolutely vibrating. Are you on your phone or something? I'm not sure how to record this phenomenon. I can't "view image" by right clicking it because it's a link.
---
Arguing over the semantics of A name is probably the dumbest thing I've seen on here today.
---
Excuse people for getting invested in the idea of their character.
---
You'll be home in time for the queues to have started dying down.

I wouldn't join Shazz at this point. I did on "name day" so I'm sticking but not looking forward to the queues.

Pretty sure the guy was being sarcastic.

Failed out of Law School for WoW Vanilla.  Best decision ever.  Go all-in fellas.

Probably the racist name in the photo.

y everyone always shits on blizz but the fans literally drove the game to shit  from TBC onwards just demanding everything to be easier then it already is

Well imagine you're playing Counter-Strike. Then imagine a futuristic tank comes rolling down de_dust2. That's what's up with mechs.

is this enough time though!? lol

nope using desktop

Straight up, the caffeine to water ratio is too damn high.

Marksmanship is pretty gear dependent

Which is why BM is recommended for leveling at pre raid/MC
---
🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️

Did you expect a different outcome? Haha
---
I don't get much time for gaming. So having to do corpse runs because some dickhead griefer rogue is camping my body. Doesn't sound like fun.
---
I need a Sobe from a glass bottle, STAT!
---
Only drink beer and water. Water for hydration, and not enough beer to get drunk but stay alive. It's basically liquid bread. The plus side to this approach is without solid food you can spend greater periods of time at your computer with your piss bottles. Happy gaming!
---
I’d go holy as well
---

---
Gg my son, now that you have posted here some asshole will camp it.
---
It's fine. Just needed bank names and another original name. None of them were likely to be taken and if they were it's just a matter of changing letters. Just annoying they couldn't at least let people know. More for the fact others are missing out. Oh well.
---
I think this one guildy in particular may not join until a few months in.

Good thing im still a virgin. Almost lost it a few times but i knew i was saving it for the right reason and that reason is authentic classic wow!!!!!!! Begone thots!!!!! No changes!!!!!

Shadow can heal dungeons very well

Dumbest take I’ve ever heard
---
Even if you only played it 20-30 hours total before quitting, that's still way more than $15 can get you in almost any other gaming/entertainment option

I did time it.  Logged in at 2:48 and didn't get kicked until 3:33 after I think I was afk too long.
---
Hey mate, sounds good!
---
Oof, Horde run from Ar'Gorok Arathi to Kargath Badlands
---
That happens to me in Firefox, but not other browsers. When I refresh the page, it stops. It's not just the logo though. It's other stuff too, when I mouse over.
---
I legit just finished that quest line.
---
You forgot the D at the end of huntar..
---
Do you mean Rapid Fire specifically or just instant abilities in general?
---
Well either way
---
Let's go for an example without any haste
---
your AS animation time is 0,5 seconds
---
If you use an instant ability during these 0,5 seconds - let's say you use it in the middle at 0,25 seconds you reset the AS animation.
---
In that case there are two potential responses from the server
---
If you've just used a default hotkey to use an instant ability the server interrupts the AS and after a delay (network traffic confirming the action between the server and your client) starts to cast the AS again
---
so the timeline could look like this
---
0 start to cast AS
---
0,25 instant ability, AS interrupted 
---
network delay adds + 0,0X seconds
---
0,25+0,0X start to cast AS
---
0,75+0,0X AS finishes
---
The macro tells the server even in that worst case scenario
---
Hey I want to use this instant ability, but you don't need to confirm with me that a ranged ability starts AS. I want you to toggle AS again
---
So it looks like
---
no network delay as we are telling the server that we want to use AS asap again
---
0,25 start to cast AS
---
0,75 AS finishes
---
If you try this macro with multi shot the game delays the auto shot animation with the multi shot animation time ( this is a remnant of the old technology whereby the server got the time window to pick the additional 2 targets based on your positioning)
---
leaving the technical bits aside
---
A Multishot into AS would look like this with 0 haste
---
0 MS
---
0,5 start AS
---
1,0 finish AS
---
This is also the reason why the AiS rotation goes AiS, AS, MS and not AiS, MS, AS
---
The 4:3 rotation would be an advanced example for this as it uses arcane over AiS with ~80% of your potential melee swingtimers and 100% ranged swingtimers. (the default AiS rotation clips/delays a certain percentage of your ranged swingtimers based on the speed of the weapon that you use and only utilizes around 55% of your melee swingtimers)
---
As you run back on range because your auto shot cooldown is about to finish the forced toggle (!) AS macro makes sure that the game knows: hey I want to fire an arcane shot, but I also want to start my AS as soon as possible
---
again if you don't see your swingtimers with the help of addons this can be really tricks to do as the ArS will interrupt and reset the AS animation time if you use it during the AS cast
---
very creative and very cool! Congrats and enjoy yourself
---
thas pretty badas
---
Yeah, we're in hog heaven.
---
Get off at 4 CDT from work, with about a 45 minute drive home so I gotta have the wife boot up my game
---
This happens everytime Blizzard launches anything. People should know better.
---
Screenshot of what....
---
&gt;Yep we’d be much better off without layering so nobody can play at all while they sit in queues or the starting area all day crashing.
---
This is a boogieman created by Blizzard.  This was a non-issue before Blizzard suddenly threw sharding/layering at us.  The problems you are afraid of would be largely insignificant, easily avoided and mitigated, and do not require the significant change to the game to fix that layering represents.
---
&gt;It’s temporary. If you want to make friends leveling, then add them. Once phase 2 goes live you can meet tons of new people who are in the one layer your server has, until then, just be happy the layers are there so you can log in at all.
---
I address in my post why the "temporary" aspect of Layering is still detrimental to most players.
---
Today was the first day I bought an energy drink in like 3 years and it was a 4 pack of Monsters still chilling in the fridge.
---
I personally can't wait to right-click-report all the explicit racism I see.  Fingers crossed for swift bans, maybe we can shave a few seconds off the next queues.
---
BankyMcBankface
---
This has nothing to do with them and everything about propping up subscriber numbers. If Blizz didn't need the numbers they would still be saying you think you do but you dont.
---
I see what your trying to do, knowing that most people won't test this, encouraging people to log in way early, and assume their safe, so that by the time they relealize it was false information you are already ahead of them in the queue.
---
If you don't want to heal, don't play anything with the ability to heal: no priest, pally, druid, or shaman.
---
Not a year went by that I didn't listen to this.
---
I think your forgetting the third option kill him and leave and just not saying anything that was my primary option all the time
---
Hah, I moderated it way down during that victory lap. Played casually into Cata. My finest memories are from my Wotlk days, tbh.
---
Yeah but Darnassus isn't that bad.
---
Doesn't mean that's a good thing.
---
Meh no one with top tier gear really cares since it is so easy to get in retail. Plus it isn't like the game is going anywhere.
---
I'm happy that I've got the name Notmograine.
---
Now off to find Mograine.
---
I disabled subreddit styling because this sub always had a huge lag
---
its shit like this that made normal wow garbage...gotta have the easy way 24/7..cant learn anything about it, cant figure it out..gotta have the answers before you play.
---
its pathetic really..all the addons imo fucked the game, they killed the community by adding all these easy queues to get raids and shit...totally broke the game.
---
i hope they dont fuck this up with any of that garbage again
---
All the same people that still care about that crap thought the same thing.
---
A cheesecake matches well for all of us rolling on THICCmane

I dont see their TV watching as a serious hobby either Haha
---
energy drinks do nothing, short burst of alertness followed by sleep.  Coffee keeps me going all night though
---
&gt;you seem a bit tense and agenda-laden
---
Think you're missing the target on this one, or perhaps you're trying too hard to sound intelligent. 99% of people who played vanilla are playing classic for nostalgia, so you're the 1%, congrats.
---
&gt;Let’s be honest too, the vast majority of kids will remain with fortnite, and unless they know older people, are not talking about classic wow in the schoolyard over fortnite.
---
Someone else already said the kiddies are following streamers. So, there are fartnite streamers coming to wow classic, thus fartnite kiddies coming to wow classic. 
---
Perhaps you're showing your age, but let's be honest, kids in school don't talk anymore and are glued to their phones, tablets or mobile consoles when you would have been in the "schoolyard". 
---
In any case, my comment was meant to be a joke, which should be apparent. You shouldn't get butt hurt over every comment someone makes about your favorite games (in this case, fartnite).
---
now, what's wrong with balance druids?
---
if you picked the wrong class/spec, got to vanilla late in its lifecycle, or  didn't like the long leveling experience, I could easily see people hating on Vanilla.
---
It doesn't matter that I'll be levelling with a warrior?
---
It's basically first, CS:GO has a huge esport event, so I wouldn't count that.
---
"shadow an"
---
You're absolutely correct, but you can still make friends and play moderately.
---
No, they’re just a lot smarter.
---
Stranglethorn Vale. It’s the most notorious zone for everyone ganking each other. And as a rogue, it’s the easiest to sneak up on someone to take em out.
---
&gt; just be happy the layers are there so you can log in at all.
---
I logged into many different MMOs without Layering just fine.
---
If you don't want to heal, Id avoid paladin or priest.
---
Are you intending to level with the friends or solo?
---
Play whatever you want. Just know that Paladins (like all hybrid classes) can have a higher learning curve and come with certain social implications at max. Usually the suggested class for first timers are pet classes like Hunters or Warlocks, but in the end what matters is that you vibe with your character.
---
Plus, you know, coffee tastes nice

---
Same here! Get a small group for it and it's gravy. Or solo it as a druid :o
---
Other people are stating they’re getting booted after a few seconds, could just be server issues.
---
If everyone does that they're going to have a really fun time when phase 2 starts and layers get removed massively reducing the number of people online simultaneously on that server.
---
Cause i wasnt sure if i want to even play? There are many reasons lol. Stop being such a neckbeard.
---
Why should I spend money, when I cannot play the game? If I would have buy before, then I would have had to pay for days/hours I did not play the game. I don’t see why blizzard didn’t fix their servers for this. It’s fucking 2019.
---
Someone actually managed to snag Migraine as a name on Mograine.
---
I *am* using PaleMoon which is basically FireFox, but I've never seen anything like this before and even closing the browser down and starting it up again doesn't seem to fix it. I dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
nibba?
---
Or....another anecdote:
---
I played WoW a lot but quit in college and had my social life and did my work and got my office job directly after school that I was successful in for a few years. It made me so unhappy I got severe depression and got fired from it and now at the age of 30 I struggle to make a liveable wage after being scared out of the office world and still not over my issues. Just had to live with my parents for 3 months too.
---
And then there is my high school friend who dropped out to play wow. Didn't go to college. Got addicted to mountain dew to the point of it making him sick daily. Played wow through wrath pretty solid. Finally quit wow and got his life together. Without even going to college he got a great job at a software company. He's a guy I always pictured as forever alone. Has a fiance and owns a house now. I've never had a girlfriend and struggle to afford rent and I thought "I did it right" and he "did it wrong" and look where we are today
---
fucking anything can happen man just take life as it comes.
---
Snailmail
---
What they aren't taking into account right now is the fact that a single player is making players on multiple servers.  When people get on their server, a ton of these reserved names will go away.
---
Undead like you and the other 1.2 million rogues.
---
But why? The Night Elf zones are fucking awesome. Darkshore is my favorite 10-20 zone in the game.
---
Grow up and learn to make a decision for yourself. You're a parent now not a child.
---
But, vanilla was actually harder at early patch level. Classic is coming out with the 1.12 talent tree and itemization. Not that that's necessarily a bad idea, but stuff changed pretty significantly from early patching, so comparing is a bit apples and oranges. The simplest way to prove how much it changed is that  Scholo &amp; Strat stopped being raids. Doing the quests in those dungeons was part of your chops way back.
---
I'm not sorry that they decided to stay with 1.12 talents and itemization... warrior talents were really garbage early on and I'm just as happy to skip that whole mess again. But... I think they probably should have retuned stuff a bit.
---
It's not a big unknown universe anymore... nothing of the strategies is new, and there's so many addons now that make it stupid simple to do stuff. It'd be sad to simply faceroll the stuff that was so awesome because of the amount of coordination and cooperation it required back then.
---
You sound really upset that retail is dead
---
Yep, site is dead. I can't redeem a code or buy  a subscription... "You think you wan't, but you don't".... I'm so angry.
---
(*scratches head*)  "It's free if you're subscribed"... bwuh? So you're saying "It's free if you've paid for it"?  I don't think that's how 'free' works.
---
I imagine they'll just lock the sub for a few hours because the amount of spam will be insane.
---
So while you're in the game not even playing, some poor guy is waiting in queue
---
WHITEMANE 
---
WTT: Stealing, Trainer, Personal, Enslaved, Forms, Classical, Bellyache.  
---
WTB: Luke, Luc
---
maybe, that name is borderline, but some are intentionally named to troll
---
and that existed 15 years ago, but it wasn't as prevalent
---
Oh good point
---
That's funny, my situation was the opposite. My wife and I had kids when Vanilla came out and we struggled to find time to play. We nevertheless managed to have great careers, raise three beautiful kids, see two grandchildren born, and watch one of our daughters become my business partner. And now that we're empty nesters and retired, we're approaching Classic with all the time in the world! She's playing a Rogue and I'm playing Priest, let the fun begin!

---
Yeah, was just about to say this.
---
I really think that Blizzard are missing a massive opportunities but because we have no alternative timeline to see what would have happened if they wouldn't have pandered to the lowest common denominator we'll never know.
---
But I do think that the more successful classic is, the more Blizzard will finally start listening to this wakeup call.
---
Looks amazing!
---
because its true, as tested by myself and many others, Switching servers is the only thing that keeps you logged, but it also puts you to the back of the queue.
---
the name Ejaculation was available
---
Set up base at a Starbucks
---
lolololol
---
I genuinely do not understand how such an experienced company as Blizzard in MMOs and in the field of entertainment as a whole, could underestimate the re-release of one, if not the most played, and one of the most long standing MMO and franchise ever in gaming. 
---
Given how Nostalrius had over 1M subs and how every stress test was full and with the queues in what was just the beta; just how the fuck did they not see this happening? It's beyond me. Not like they can't merge servers if there are too many and people quit down the road. Like for real, wtf were they thinking?
---
The straw was the name reservation limit that was forgotten for 30mins by Blizz today. Seems like a non issue but if you wanted a name and had 3 on other realms you wanted to keep and not delete to get screwed twice, you were out of luck. Very disappointing coming from Blizzard.
---
YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!!!
---
Will of the Forsaken makes warlocks a bit easier to handle at max level. Orc has the better pve racial, undead have better PvP racial.
---
Finally a post that’s not fucking Cheetos and soda!
---
Both my wife and myself were laid off from good paying jobs (yes, same place) 5 days before WoW came out.  Our unemployment was enough to cover our bills for a few months.  I got to play virtually 25/8.  No kids either!
---
Some of my good friends were also laid off from the same job at the same time.  We quickly had a guild and quested non stop forever.  We were so into the game that I remember we stayed home New Year's Eve and raided the Crimson Monestary thing (whatever it was called).
---
You can buy name changes now on PUBG iirc. If that's even something still interests you, that is.
---
Went back to it these past few weeks with some friends while we wait for classic. Game's in an alright place. Still fun.
---
But I've been playing that character for literally 15 years. And don't call me Shirley.
---
What dick move?

Uh.. doctors note?

All this sub does is shit on retail so im not sure why you’re surprised that there are retail players who chirp back
---
'Demand' is a strange concept. Are we talking about demand from hardcore guilds? If so, that's perhaps legit. But for casual or semi-casual guilds? 40 people is a lot to get together. A lot of guilds, whether they plan to or not, are going to be taking any warm body they can find.
---
Im 41 and Been drinking water all day, 2.5 liter so far, had chicken and sallad to meal, sleept for 4 hours this afternoon,my body is rdy for classic. I'm allergic to caffeine . Most impotent is drink water and then more water water water.
---
Another thing to consider is class quests &amp; flavor- warlocks have some of the coolest class quests, from the quests that teach you your demon summons to the mount quest (warlocks get a "free" mount at 40 &amp; 60, though they are time consuming and still require gold/materials). 
---
However, also consider that mobs have a debuff limit and you will not always have priority. This requires more attention &amp; awareness from you while in a raid.
---
Just watched the video. He said 10k likes, now 100k. So he really set himself up. Considering it was the topic of popular South Park episode, and WoW is a popular game - he was destined to hit that mark
---
Just play to have fun and learn along the way
---
 What's the point otherwise
---
A noob is coming! Congrats!
---
Can you show me how to accidentally make a cheesecake plz?
---
Night Elf has a super cool starting zone to get immersed in, but beware, it is very difficult to understand how to get to the main Alliance cities as one.
---
A good resto druid will beat a mage in 1v1 if there is any LoS cover to use. You don't need damage gear, moonfire and insect swarm base damage is enough.
---
Yea it’s more so for the “tryhards” 
---
People who have been playing classic on private servers for the last ten years. There’s no point for them to experience the game like the average casual player will because they’ve just done it all lots of times over already. So for them it’s just how to be as efficient as possible and if that means completely skipping zones so be it. 
---
It took me awhile to come to terms with the fact that 90 percent of the people playing have played the game for years and years where I played wrath of lich for a bit and that’s about it, so I’m taking this like I’ve never played before and taking it slowish
---
just do it. you're only sacrificing a small bit of advantage is what ultimately are very niche scenarios. at the end of the day, how well you play matters hundreds of times more than your race.
---
That's what you get for waiting until the last minute. We all knew the servers, stores and everything in between would crash.
---
Well it is indeed free. As you can subscribe on your account for retail. So subscribe for retail. Get classic free.....
---
Same, site seems down.
---
I've read it's basically number of accounts with at least one toon registered in the server
---
Really? I love my knp profile in bfa.. So you're telling me i can download the same version for classic? Thats awesome.
---
Same here. Got my remote desktop ready to log in at work. I remember I think it was for Warlords I logged into the queue remotely and I was in it for 2 hours, basically only waited 5 minutes after getting home from work.
---
This is a personal preference that nobody can really answer for you. I myself happen to do a lot of internal role playing in my head. So if something doesn't make sense to me I won't do it usually. Most people aren't like this but for me it's an important thing to be able to believe things about my character. Just do what you want and try to have fun.
---
Same issue here. But at least I created my Troll Shaman!
---
Literally everyone knew this would happen.
---
Way to wait until the last minute...
---
Haha
---
If you where efficient about it, you could hit 100h in just over 3days. On that shedule you can set yourself up for a reasonable 144 hours of playtime before you get to go back to work.
---
Lol I mean not all majors are equal so
---
Go 5/5 wand spec then 5/5 spirit tap. After that up to you. At 40 you have the choice to respec into deep shadow for more dps. You'll know by then if you should switch.
---
I'll never regret playing Vanilla WoW but I do wish I spent even 10% less time on it, I could have gotten everything done IRL without sacrificing anything significant in-game. 
---
The amount of time I spent just fucking around in Org or doing pointless side activities, I could have spent that time studying, exercising, and socializing. And I'd still have plenty of time to raid, PvP, etc.
---
Honestly, you should just watch the entire thing. I've watched the whole series so many times, there just aren't many bad or boring episodes. I'd suggest starting right where you left off.
---
Won't know until you try!
---
hide report cards behind the closet until they pour out
---
Welp, time for an alt...
---
Imagine that blizz tops all those games just by releasing an old title, rofl.
---
Well, that’s adorable.
---
Yes but I removed it and wanted to repost it, hope its ok because i wanted to include the community :)
---
It says 2h 49min to me...whats up
---
I have the same problem, seems like a lot of people have had this issue for the last hour or so. Lets hope it clears up before launch
---
Find a group of people to play with!
---
They can help you if they're experienced and if you're anything like me having a group of people to play with makes games 100x better and more entertaining.
---
might be getting heavy traffic. Maybe don't wait til the last minute next time?
---
I mean it’s free if you subscribe for bfa
---
Sounds good! It's worth the trouble.
---
Dude....the Deadmines that early. How can you not?
---
Possible your work admins have blocked games on your laptop.

I get off work 6 hours after launch. I start work AT launch. I'm pissed

Just start playing.  Do your own thing.  If it seems like it's going too slow then try looking for a simple guide to give you a few pro tips.  Honestly, it's more fun to discover stuff just by playing the game and talking to people you group up with.
---
It's entirely possible.
---
"laptop from work" - More than likely a VPN/anti virus issue then.
---
Just jump in and explore, that's the spirit of vanilla. You can fix whatever mistakes you make and have fun no matter what.

The shop is where they do money on all games, I guess it's the first thing they are going to fix !
---
This isn't just excitement.

This is... Advanced excitement.

My understanding of people wanting to log in 30ish minutes prior would be to wait in the queue and be at the character selection screen prior to the actual start of the server. If they try to authenticate too early, they run the risk of being on the character selection screen *more* than 30 minutes before the realms actually open (and they can press "enter world"). If they are on that screen for more than 30 minutes, they will be booted for AFK. 
---
I believe the logging in during the 30m or less to launch window is a separate issue from the queue itself.
---
&gt;World of Warcraft is the Football of MMORPGs and dumbing it down or trying to make it like Soccer is stupid as hell.

That moment when you realise that football != soccer because the person writing this is a filty yank.

---
The 3 character limit has been removed.
---
Oh man this brings back memories. FPS Doug was the shit!
---
Question, is it not possible to have two clients open? For example have one client with my main open and the other client with my alt on it so I don't have to continue to log in and out to mail everything around? In other MMO's this was possible.
---

I don’t worry. The post made me think “It’s time to slay the dragon!” So I wanted to share.
---
Will it be back tomorrow so that we can see all the fresh memes about whatever new Error # we get for this launch?
---
When i first started WoW I asked my brothers friends for help with a name for my Dwarf Hunter - They were 4 years older then me and in hindsight i made a pretty massive error.
---
I got my Dwarf hunter to level 15 before realising what "Phallis" Meant, resulting in a fairly rapid delete
---
Put a ring on it, and I'm not talking about freezing band.
---
Tenacious D for life my dude
---
Everyone who has experienced an MMO launch knows what to expect. There are always issues. They know its going to happen and we know its going to happen.
---
No company is going to invest the time and money needed to provide the additional architecture that will be needed for a 12 hour period, once.

gameplay preference for pvp?  Orc racial apparently increases base resist to stun by 25% (total not % of your resist level, blizzard language on % changes has always been unclear and I assumed this was just a net 1.25% stun resist increase for most classes)
---
but having wotf on YOUR cooldown, meaning you plan around it, is a notable gameplay issue vs. a passive.  obv. the utility is vs different classes vs. orc racial too.
---
Tight with money
---
or if you play wow. the name of an adorable cat in naxxramas
---
Gnomes are so short he overlooked them.
---
So, whats your back up realm?
---
Just like my level ten hunter running from mulgore to darnassus for that sweet baby owl. Then to Westfalen for screech. Omg I’m going to forget to get second pet slot.
---
Noone knows
---
Im on right now and havent got kicked in 45 minutes.

---
I kick myself for not getting one of these when they were available way back.
---
Most of the bugs don't have a gameplay impact and that's the most important imho
---
I'm in Chicago too, but I work in the suburbs.  I'll be leaving work in about 15 minutes so I can back to the city in time.  
---
Fun fact: did you know that all of the Eastern realms are based in Chicago hosted by AT&amp;T?  I have AT&amp;T fiber at the house... I get sub 5ms pings to WoW now since it never leaves their network.
---
Blizz should throw in the ™
---
Seriously, days? More like 10 weeks.
---
Why can't you?
---
The server populations will be very very different on release day versus 3 months from now
---
Okay thank you!
---
Seems like everyone decided to play on "lowest pop out of original 4" which was originally Firemaw; now it's the highest pop.
---
I know 😂 have fun
---
It's not really full. If you have a toon there, it will count, despite never ever going to use it. And since you now can make toons on severel servers, people have made all servers "full", despite never going to play there.
---
But man is there gonna be queues today. Everywhere. If servers don't just outright die.
---
As a quick heads up, our engineers are addressing an issue that's preventing customers from being able to redeem subscription codes and/or pay for subscriptions at this time. I don't have an ETA for the resolution, but it is our priority to have this resolved as soon as possible.
---
yeah I spent that entire time watching my cousin level his mage haha
---
No one knows yet, even blizzard said they are not sure if they will expand on classic content or introduce BC.
---
U dont get kicked after 30 minutes if u click ceeate character n stuff every so often.. Ive been doing it for over an hour now
---
Not only that but super basic skills until lvl40, pulling 2 mobs might be a close call. In wpvp you will get kited all day.
---
&gt;2000+19
---
&gt;Still playing League
---
ISHYGDDT
---
Nice the exact same title again, very clever stuff
---
This could have been useful before I created and deleted 100 alts trying to figure out which server I wanted to play on.
---
Because even with a 90% drop off 20 layers turns into 2 -  which is still too much for a single server.
---
Camp Taurajo and other pre-city towns dont have a fp, and Silithus' afaik comes later with AQ. I also don't remember DM or Maraudon having one, Maraudon has a horde FP kinda close. Searing gorge has one though, ofc this is mostly private server memory so I could always be wrong.
---
To quote a guy from the Countdown to Classic podcast that theorycrafted boomkins, "Boomkins don't have mana issues in 2019."
---
You get a discount if you reach Honored with your race. However, in order to use other race's mounts you need to reach exalted with them. So levelling as a dwarf in the gnome area brings you closer to a mechanostrider, but lowers your potential to get a discount on your dwarven ram. Depends what mount you want at level 60 as to whether it's worth it. In the grand scheme of things it won't make much difference. Dwarves and gnomes merge questlines really early. Even if you stayed in your starting area, you'll be meeting up with gnomes within an hour or so.
---
Nah. That is just reductionist. There is more nuance to be seen than just "some people complain".
---
I've been set on Rogue for months cause vanilla PvP so fun but now last second I'm wondering Human Mage for powering through that pure gold/rep grind
---
Blizzard lifted the 30 min kick, you can stay on char select now
---
Considering that was the entire point of lifting the 3 character cap, very weird. Not smooth blizzard, not smooth. I have a unique name so it doesn't affect me, but I feel bad for others who had their name, deleted it to get on a lower pop but then lost it
---
Same. Let our voice be heard!
---
I graduated in 2006... have a wife, two daughters and manage 15 engineers today.  Won't be playing much - can confirm :)
---
Thanks.  I’ll check him out.  I don’t watch any “wow streamers”, but DrLupo and Timthetatman keep talking about a ton of stuff and I’m just sitting here like, what language are these people speaking haha.
---
The Boar Slayer
---
yeah this goes back to play whatever interests you the most. It depends on the streamers you like as some are horde and others are alliance. This isn't completely updated but a quick glance has the faction of the streamer http://avoidstreamers.com/ 
---
Ignore the fact it's a website about avoiding steamers if you want to play with them.
---
If in fact you aren't just joining the back of the line.
---
Praise the light, you're right !
---
Very tempted to go to 24h supermarket for WoW subscription.. then again I don't have much hope even getting on tonight
---
Guerrero sounds dope af
---
Not really, the best option is to enter 29 minutes before the launch.
---
Cant use titles like king,queen,princes...
---
The worst part is that focusing on profits is killing their profits. 110%
---
Thanks man, it's a double-special day for me :)
---
Nostalrius made private WoW classic server to an big audience. As been mentioned in a post before Nostalrius gave blizzard the last push the needed to make Classic, i quess the prob have been thinking about that step for a long time....
---
Sounds like a plan. You guys wait half an hour while I test out if it crashes at launch.
---
Don't bitch about not having access to the game or whatever name you wanted then.
---
did feel kind of weird with BoD being 7 easy bosses then jaina on mythic, but yeah everything else I agree with, all my friends quit near launch of uldir.
---
Firemaw is the brazillian server, hope your spanish is good.
---
That is awful hah. USA maybe? I'm on Comcast and have $60 for 400/10. Wish it was symetrical, but the download for the cost isn't bad.
---
Matey, if I can have 1gbps down in New Zealand in a city of 60,000 people, America should be well ahead of that by now.
---
Companies are reluctant to lay more lines in your country because of your first paragraph. They've gaslighted you guys into thinking you have it 'good enough' like with the rest of your silly policies, so they don't have to cough up any $$ to improve infrastructure. It's incredibly shortsighted, and Australia is currently going through the same thing down our way.
---
The problems compounds because of the size of your country as well. When they finally do decide to roll out the lines, they're going to be 10 years behind the rest of the world. I can't imagine America ever betting on wireless in any case, as terrestrial will always be more secure. China could shoot wireless sats out of the sky tomorrow - they can't destroy lines under your soil as easily.
---
haha
---
I've definitely done changes like that.
---
Let's herd some cats while we're at it.

Wondering the same thing
---
There are 6 planned content phases where we will go through the major updates/releases during vanilla wow. It’s thought that this may take ~two years to complete. What happens after that is still unknown, though the two leading thoughts are Burning Crusade, or a literal expansion of the classic experience currently deemed classic+

Sorry, but vanilla is not casual.  It wasn't casual then, and it isnt casual as classic.
---
Started reading this hoping it was a something like an Animal Farm riff.  Wasn't, but not disappointed.
---
&gt; No one cares enough about satisfying your curiosity ***or arguing with you***
---
I haven't missed anything bud. People have been arguing with me and here you are STILL arguing with me. Self awareness. You lack it.
---
I'm looking forward to it!
---
Stating what I believe the point of Vanilla leveling is means projecting onto others? Ok.
---
I believe the point of traffic lights is to control the flow of traffic. 
---
Did I just project my opinion onto everyone who drives cars?
---
Horde | PVP | UD Priest
---
Currently parked on Skeram, but willing to relocate if I can get with a guild soon. Don't have a ton of time like the old days, so looking for guild who's a little more casual or who needs back up heals.

You still have an hour and a half. Stab yourself in the bottom of the foot and get a medical leave.

Yeah, I've been following the firemaw situation and it seems like it'll have the same amount if not more players than Shazzrah at this point. Crazy stuff!
---
For those curious, if the game can't tell where you are (you're in an unknown zone, which can be told by /who yourself or by not being in and unable to join a general chat) then when you die you will be set to your faction's default graveyard. For the Alliance, that is Westfall.
---
Make sure you put more emphasis on the “novice” part. Been rocking a Gnome Rogue main since vanilla, so we’ll see haha

Hey, i never learned to draw traditionally and still can't. I made this one with a mouse and Photoshop \o/. You never know until you try, so i can only encourage you to. Maybe watch some YouTube videos to get started or collect some art you like and then try to recreate it. See you in Azeroth!
---
But to flag it as such.... lame but thank you for educating me
---
Seriously.  My nvidia drivers caused sound problems for over a year.  They finally made one that dosn't a while back, and I havn't updated since.  Unfortunately my shadowplay dosn't work with this one tho, so I am torn about updating and hoping or just sticking to this old guy until he can't do the job anymore.  : /

nope they removed the kick, ive been chillin in char select for an hour.
---
Missing the Humor tag.
---
You say it is, but it ain't.
---
no, there is stuff in bfa to do, while for example in wod, you had literally nothing to do besides raiding for 2 years, objectively wod was worse, bfa have cool raids, nice locations, some treadmill to run on, several in fact, it's not great, but by stating "worse every" you showing that you ahve no idea what are you talking about
---
Merging servers 15 years ago vs merging servers now i can imagine is probably a lot easier.
---
Its 100% blackrock slicer.

Very good advice. All I can think about is getting home to WoW.  It's my main focus right now as I can barely focus on work. Ugh.....

why
---
more time than I have spent on retail in quite some time :)
---
Where you leveling? I'm a human going to Loch. Love that place
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
Seriously, people should have known better than this.  I re-subbed last Saturday because there was an almost 100% chance this would happen.
---
Wish I could be human horde.
---
Worst part is, you need to time it so you enter at about 23.35, Otherwise odds are once you get on the server you will get kicked and added to the queue. (30minute limit)
---
This is the weirdest thing about classic imo. It was new the first time but this time people are going in optimized. Although I guess the original still had beta players and guides.
---
blizzard is suprised. they started an investigation. i m very curious what they will figure out.
---
That's the softcore porn section of twitch.
---
Hey, it's been a while since I played on any server, can you go into a little more detail on the steps? I really want to get an owl for my troll hunter. 
---
When you say spirit run past "Splintertree Post, Felwood, Bloodvenom Falls" you mean actually die, and run as a ghost past all those places to auberdine? Then run as a ghost towards darnasus under the docs to get sent to northern darkshore? Then again as a ghost get on the boat?
---
You had a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time to set aside 20 bucks dude.
---
Unnecessary
---
That's cool, I'll get to brush up on my Spanish! 
---
It's also where quite a few Scandinavian guilds seem to be going.
---
Whelp sounds dope
---
Press f to pay respects
---
Who downvoted this lol
---
I was going to go to Stalaag with Skeram as my backup. But Skeram filled up so fuck it I'll got to Incendius.
---

Who used the discs in 2004? Just install the beta client lul.
---
Even if you have no one to play with you are going to find many groups to play with along the way. At the end of the day it's entirely up to you
---
l o l
---
Ah I see ty. Though I'm 90% sure it was before Cata. Either BC or WOTLK but that doesn't really matter.
---
It's an amazing podcast tbh.
---
Chucknorris is pretty much a barrens thing. Alliance don't have an equivalent.
---
Mankriks wife, and Defias Messenger fit together well.
---
they changed it 1 hour ago 
---
i had 2 accounts online -&gt; both disconnected  at the same time they changed "enter world soon"
---
did not get disconnected since then was about 1 hour ago
---
Firemaw now has a queue of 12k with estimated time 66 min
---
Most hardcore pve goes alliance.  Better facials for it.  Back in the day horse used to own in pvp.  Playing field is a little more fair now in terms of skill though (horde for some reason had more skilled players back in the day) and paladins turn the tide.  They are just the deciding factor in most premades.  A premade with 3 pallies will do better than the horse equivalent.
---
Only has Alliance starting zones though.
---
old blanchy \ realm and mainly lvling and pvp for now and going to start troll and we have heals, tank and a dps already to start the lvling grind if interested hit me up and ill give discord info
---
It's crazy people were still on dial-up when this came out. IDK if you're being facetious, but there's no way that was cost effective relative to the time wasted waiting for everything to load.
---
should be a dropdown thinger  under version
---
We have all been logged for over 30 minutes. You will not get kicked.
---
Mostly, just stinks when I have to download anything.
---
Skinning in the late game is relatively low income. Most recipies that need any skins will not need many of them, so you don't exactly have a dedicated customer base (except for heavy leather, since that is a thorium brotherhood turnin).
---
Any gold is better than no gold, though.
---
I agree, I’m just glad they can go up a bit higher than actual Classic.
---
But do you have a rogue?
---
Yep, Herod was the first big pvp server in the US and everyone expects it to be completely unplayable.
---
Ugh, spantards.. Why can't you just stick to your choice....
---
I think everyone has good points, but the best advice is that C's get degrees
---
How long from now should it be ?
---
We're a casual PvE / Hardcore PVP guild looking to raid on Sundays from 12-3ish CST. Trying to aim our times around working folk and people who can't raid the traditional 7-11. Hit us up on discord if you're interested at all!

You can change version on the thingy above the "PLAY" Bar
---
The moment you get in and it tries to render everyone *POOF*.
---
Pay with PayPal.
---
It is on us to spam our capital cities with "LFG" and not complain when it takes 20-25 minutes to assemble a group, and then yet *another* 30 minutes to corral everyone together to the instance, assuming no one's taking their sweet time because they assume they'll just get summoned there.
---
We'll see, but we must be strong.
---
OSRS is only as big as it is because it still gets solid quality updates almost every week.  If we were still on the base 2007 version I can't imagine it being nearly as big as it is now.
---
they aren't gonna balance specs in classic, there is just no way that ends well, , I would *love* to have eleshaman tree resemble more the tBC tree with crit-based clearcasting, but that would just rattle all other underperformers and people would accuse blizzard of playing favorites, you remember dot shock? they aren't gonna repeat that.
---
altho I question what people expect from the "social aspect" alot of people are already in pre-planned guilds they will be doing dungeons and raids with, there will be far less meeting strangers that came with vanilla, don't be surprised when most of the banter in dungeons will be about "ninja-ed hunter loot"...
---
What realm is this?
---
I do, I'm a software developer. In what way is is doing customer support a tech job? Note that it isn't technical support, it's customer support. They're not dealing with technical problems, they're helping customers with their orders.
---
i got logged, what are you talking about
---
I can confirm.
---
They knocked out everyone @ ~1:39PDT and we have all been online since.
---
We have been opening and closing the realm list every 20 minutes, but none of us are 100% if it's necessary.
---
I met a ton of great people on pservers and I’m super happy that many of them have coalesced in the guild I’m in for classic.  You really don’t know what you’re talking about.  The ratio of toxic people to awesome people in the pserver community is about the same you’ll find in any cross section of (primarily) 25-40 year old (primarily) males anywhere on this planet man.  I pulled the demographics out of my ass there, but you get my point.
---
What was the name
---
Alright Thanks
---
There is no teleport back.  Either you have to fly to Darnasus (maybe Auberdine, IDK) or Thunderbluff.  
---
You can, of course, use your hearthstone.
---
Fuck, I didn't need these feels right now
---
I was also at my local Asda for TBC at midnight! Also not the only one! I miss doing that.
---
Which server ?
---
I would have been fine taking a day of vacation, maybe tomorrow after launch, but I can't understand the people taking a whole week.
---
Pray for me. I have a meeting at 5:10 (EST) which I have been told will last one hour.
---
Don't do what I did the first time trying to do my druid quest and think I could go straight down to Stormwind since I thought that was the only way to go (I didn't know there was a team).
---
Goood that i woke up early then, im gonna queue up :)  
---
kinda lucky i didnt try to log in @ 23.30 pm :P
---
12k in the queue? that is crazy. Happy that the new German server have no queue at the moment
---
Click the redeem code link, that doesn't even work. Goes to same error page.
---
You're a Broncos fan? You in Denver by any chance?
---
Easier how? It wasn't “difficult” to do back then. Players just hate having their names and guilds removed from them. They hate other communities. To this day many realms claim their server was ruined by the people on the realm they were merged with.
---
Doing it today wouldn't remove these issues.
---
Been on select screen for an hour listening to music and using arrow keys every minute or so, not been kicked yet
---
Oh shit, here we go again.
---
They don’t have redundant servers?
---
Nah, I wanna get home to play some wow. If I mow down some people who care? They were probably alliance gnomes
---
Thank you all so much! Didn‘t expect so many answers. Classic old Vanilla community :)
---
This is great! I do like the way Oldschool Runescape produces new and meaningful content while still keeping the nostalgic feel
---
Don’t underestimate the classic community.
---
There are no mediums it's either high or full.
---
I'm in the UK. I won't be playing until 17 hours after launch. 5pm local time... And there's gonna be a queue. Uggghhhhh
---
Chuck Norris doesn't do pushups, he pushes the Earth down.
---
lol is this Herod?
---
Are you interested in Fury, Frenzy, or Conqueror on Bigglesworth?
---
i think its Firemaw
---
meh you guys are too literal. Always going to the max. Everything doesn't have to be all or nothing lol pretty easy to read between the lines.
---
Where are you that you get accepted to the military and immediately go? Fuck, it took me 3 weeks before I was able to leave
---
I just got through my servers queue, do I just wait at the character selection screen until launch or am I gonna have to login and wait again?
---
There’s actually a room there’s thats just a smaller version of this
---
It's the first day. What's more important is how it is the first month or two.
---
Can we make him a saint or something ???
---
World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns\\{Addon Name} is what you're looking for ... you can check the Addons button on the character select screen to check, lower left corner. I think the button only appears if you have addons in the folder, but I'm not 100% sure about that.
---
There is only Try For Free tab and under it I can change the server
---
Same here.  Literally the best best internet in the area. I wish they deployed it everywhere... ATT was forced to deploy it in the Dish acquisition, and they stopped as they hit the legal requirement.
---
I'm in Bagram and it launches an hour into my shift....
---
Leatherworking and selling the metric ton of leather I’ll be skinning.
---
Then my suggestion doesn't help much.
---
Yeh... I think the server you log into now is going to be the one you end up playing on tonight.
---
*assuming the people saying 30 min afk kick is removed*
---
You stole this straight from Family Guy go kill yourself.
---
Thanks, I’ll look it up
---
It’s high now the end is near
---
Then there would be an argument for blizz to open servers for all languages no? They most likely pick based on the playerbase who are subscribed from certain countries
---
Sorry guys, i don't want it patched yet.
---
Go mow a lawn or wash somebodies car dude.
---
I know you’re hoping somebody is going to offer you a month. But go earn it yourself.
---
It was more stupid of blizzard to not have 1-2 spanish realms at start
---
Time Zones.  It's live in ONE HOUR.
---
Downvoted because you're no fun.

Blizzard is so out of touch. First the Diablo Eternal "you guys have phones don't you?" And then this comment.  
---
Maybe they should stop telling fans what they think we want and start listening to us when we tell them literally what we actually want.
---
What? It's starting in like 2 seconds dude
---
Those half a million people still "think they do".  They haven't played the game yet.
---
So god damn pumped....
---
I'd rather not say, but it was 3 letters and it's wasn't something like "fdg."
---
Should i eat shit or go on one of the new servers that were released tonight?
---
I'm not.  But I didn't underestimate the osrs community either and watched it slowly piddle out until gwd was added.
---
The entire country of Spain moved to Firemaw 3 hours ago, get the fuck out of there
---
im in character select screen for an hour now and not kicked, ive just been clicking on different characters every few minutes
---
I just joined and im at around 19000 so fuck me I guess :(
---
Servers aren't up for an hour.
---
I rerolled on Gandling, ain't putting up with this, if I am to sacrifice sleep and still go to work tomorrow it better be damn worth it loll.
---
Cool thanks
---
They are different servers. If you update the battlenet client you can toggle between battle for Azeroth and classic. They will he updated and maintained separately.
---
Making up stories for free subs... More classic than thre game being launched today.
---
I am not, sorry!
---
30 minute hard kick timer
---
I was at my local EB Games for midnight release of TBC. I remember being blown away that there was like 30+ people from my hometown waiting in line. There was this overwhelming feeling of “wait, I’m not alone in this?!?!” Despite the thousands of people I saw online everyday haha
---
you can but you'll be kicked in 30 minutes.
---
YES - IT IS DISABLED. I have tested this on several accounts.
---
Hunters are more fun imo, while mages are a bit stronger. As someone that is normally a min/maxer I never regretted going Hunter. 
---
Going Hunter again this time around with a mage alt to play now and again. Best of luck!

False

I was born and raised in California but I still call it Cali sometimes.
---
Mograine is full - don't come here!
---
Thank you good friend.
---
I can't wait to get in and group up with somebody. Though as a Lock I'm going to be to find a paladin to level with.
---
Herod is only at 4k
---
How can one play classic and not fight HOGGER!.
---
Also , i really hope someone will post a screenshot with tons of corpses around hogger :)   
---
(Damn..wish i could join classic :(  )
---
I don't mind the new models but honestly the new animations are fugly
---
while I support your choice for leaving BFA,  if you are holding out for flying, I have some bad news for you...
---
Was still in place when I tested it a few hours ago
---
I dont have much time playing maybe 2-3 hours a day at most so i decided on 3 classes i can save time on, please help me decide which to pick and keep demand and amount of ppl rolling that class in mind.
---
**Priest:**
---
Time saver: Fast dungeon groups. 
---
Reasons: I like their Tier sets a lot, i like Shadow PvP, i kinda like Holy PvE
---
**Mage:**
---
Time saver: Teleport (slow fall/blink and maybe AoE farming in dungeons)
---
Reasons: I like their Tier sets a lot, i love the Frost element as a whole, i like PoM Pyro
---
**Warlock:**
---
Time saver: Free Mount, EZ solo level
---
Reasons: I like the demons, i like the mount, i like the "evil" vibe
---
Any input is welcome, i tend to go for Priest as i think Mages will be with Rogue and Warrior 60% of the servers and Warlock is often only brought as 2-3 of in Raiding for utility as Mages simply do more DPS.
---
Same with Draenor for the EU
---
Holy shit
---
Constantly rising too. At 18k now
---
oh i've seen this meme template, you just have to ask a friend to message you certain things
---
Congrats.
---
All the servers are full right now - everyone is already logged in waiting for midnight CEST.

Classic oomkin
---
Your friend is either trolling you or an idiot.
---
Your friend is a retard.
---
It's a global release so not unless something went wrong
---
Is it? It was medium last I checked. Niceee. I'm here, waiting :)
---
They're lying.
---
They did not claim anything, there isn't anything restricting anyone from playing it. I am in Texas and I am playing on Thalnos.
---
Their is no wrong in classic. It’s about immersing yourself into the world. Satisfaction comes from discovering and learning! And from this your toon will become powerful!
---
It sucks because there are a ton of positive WoW personalities out there. Half of the Asmon streams YouTube pushes to me are just him watching better content makers. I pity those who end up on a server with him and his thugs.
---
I mean, to be fair, we're comparing a peak viewer count at release vs an everyday norm for these other games.
---
Addons have absolutely NOTHING to do with your platform. Also, you've downloaded the wrong versions.
---
everyone gets in at the same time. noone is playing yet.
---
asshole award goes to

I hate that Minecraft is over league

dwarves are the only honorable alliance race

Borderlands 3 release on 13th of September.

You can change as much as you like. Its your "account" which is active

I snagged Notmograine. 
---
I feel like I've accomplished something in my life.

Unrelated: how did you get the new Apple car play? Using iOS 13 in your phone?

Nobody can Play yet.

Still 1h to go for everyone
---
Good for you! I did the same just because of the looks and fitting name.
---
Thanks I'll be using this. Never did many early dungeons. Looks very detialed.
---
Wait. Can you log in before the servers go online? Won't it kick you out once they come online?

---
&gt; and arcane mages
---
Arcane is the primary mage spec until after BWL, though. Raids will typically have one mage go deep enough in frost to get Winter's Chill and the others go arcane.
---
im coming back after playing originally, and im not looking at any guides or anything, i remember it being amazing the first time i played, im guessing it will be just as amazing to be in at the start again.
---
 Not sure how much i will remember from back then though.
---
Then once in med school, Cs still get the degrees.
---
&gt;I just heard that Brazil claimed Thalnos, and didn't want to accidentally choose a server that would be Spanish speaking for example
---
They speak Portugese in Brazil
---
How long does the walk roughly take? I'm playing Elf druid and my friend is playing Dwarf hunter. Would we be better off finishing our starting area quests before attempting to meet one another?
---
definitely don't worry that hard.
---
WoW with almost 500k viewers on twitch an hour before launch. "You think you want it, but you don't"
---
this\^  that servers going to be a complete mess at launch
---
Where I'm at in the USA, with Mediacom (Mediacom has been really good to me, honestly)
---
I never have hiccups
---
I never have an outage (I've had maybe 2 in 4 years)
---
I'm getting faster than advertised speeds. (32 MB d/l. Yes, 32 MB)
---
And I live in a small town (~3500 people)
---
Life is good :D
---
That's true, we will see. It's worth keeping in mind though that private servers have been running Vanilla for years so there has always been some interest there.
---
Golemagg master race smh
---
Damn, really? Does anyone know what the queue time on Shazzrah is at the moment? I'm sitting in character select for like two hours.
---
And in Puppey's case, 4th place is looking for a new mid player.
---
~3:00 PM EST
---
Will the que times be for the people that entered that realm later.
---
Or just first to press ‘enter world’ at 00:00 gets in?
---
Thx for clearing that up
---
I had counseling, no benefit.
---
I found my own cure, finishing school. Since I did that my symptoms have improved markedly. I don't see how counseling is supposed to fix being in a toxic environment of teachers who don't care and being judged based on how well you completed mindless tedium. It's a stupid system that has nothing to do with how you succeed in the real world.
---
 Do you tell soldiers experiencing PTSD to seek counseling so they can be go back to fight? NO! They leave because it's not healthy for them!
---
Not every Plainstrider has a beak either.  Stingy bastards.
---
I have an undead warrior in BFA, and part of me thought I should be a human warrior for classic so I can be the same dude, just before he died.  But eff it, I wanna be dwarf, so dwarf it is.
---
And then some
---
Aight man, thanks.
---
there was a 4k queue for stalagg and herod at 5:05

That is so sad. Please follow the link and collet. This is all the money i can spare

Thanks, but I'm afraid I'm a puny baby and PVP in general just isn't my jam. I wish you good luck though!

Have you done anything to keep yourself there? Or literally just left it alone?
---
It's currenlty at 16k, 109min wait time.. I changed lol.
---
I did have a toon on moon guard and it was super slow and lame. But cross realm was implemented then, the economy was wack as well
---
I didn't say each character.
---
You don't have a max level boost. There aren't 120 boosts yet.
---
100 minutes at the moment
---
titles like king n Duke n lord r banned

there is no casual racism
---
its just racism
---
AM I a idiot, I thought it doesn't come out until tomorrow...

Because that’s true lol i experienced a spanish server, that was born as english during cata
---
It's definitely not abuse. Druid has always needed special approaches to contribute. It's a class for those willing to put in extra though. Druid isn't for everyone.
---
how? I tried it 3 times and I always get to the 30 mins mark and get disconnected
---
I'm 50 minutes queued, and at 1500 on Firemaw, and yes, I will be disappointed and sad if I get any chance to tap creatures
---
Np, hope to see ya around!
---
Yes, enter your realm already.
---
the timer only recently got removed, 3 hours ago i also got booted, not anymore now
---
I'm not a fan of either new or old undead models, and I love undead.
---
You either look like a middle aged accountant who died of male pattern baldness or a 16 year old goth with Elmer's glue hair spikes.
---
There is no in between.
---
It’s raining pretty bad over here but my internet so far works
---
how's it looking?
---
 Been idle in the character select screen for almost 2 hours now and I'm still good.
---
It’s almost like Blizzard warned us about this
---
I had to do whatever i could to get in fastwr
---
Thanks :)
---
This is what I'm doing.  I'm at "&lt; 1 minute" in my queue, and I'm periodically leaving and re-joining every few minutes to just kind of "hover" in that spot.  Here in ~10 minutes I'm going to actually let it finish out though, that way I should be safe, 30 minute rule or not.
---
are you actively moving char?
---
Meh... my friend made fun of me last night for dropping 80 bucks on a 6 month sub, but I reminded him that I don’t drink or smoke and he spends about 70 bucks a week on cigarettes and at least that much a month on beer. He got quiet fast.
---
Not with cross realm sharding you’re not
---
o shit rift players :o  
---
i was in Crayons, we probably were in a pug together at some point

I just tried and it says 17354 (113 mins)

Bigglesworth is a PST pvp server correct?
---
omg why
---
LMAO. That is not how any of this works.
---
can't wait to get puppey's machete for my warrior
---
12k people in Faerlina. It is advancing fast atm.
---
Thanks man(: I hope your classic journey is a fantastic one.
---
In 26 and i had to try to shorten my q
---
Apparently, they disabled the 30min kick(though this could be trolling from people in the queues)
---
create character + delete resets the 30min afk timer though
---
Athene! The great Paladin.
---
Good to know. I've got 2 names reserved for Classic BC. XD
---
What else is there to go on other than an account made a character?
---
The scariest moment in my time with Team Secret was during our practices, when Puppey would walk around with a machete and talk about how he always wanted to see what the inside of a human looked like. He said he had experimented on animals before and he wanted to go for the real thing.
---
yeah but you have to say you pay money for cox.
---
585k now
---
It's the streamers role playing.
---
I understand, but still...asshat.
---
I think I was 15 when who's came out and I used to play a ton of warcraft 3 TFT.  That are StarCraft were the only 2 games I ever played really.  I had no idea what to expect fr wow but I heard you got to play first/third person as a character and I has envisioned playing as a ghoul lol.  I really thought you would be playing as soon units turned out cooler then expected obviously
---
I tested it too, I got disconnected after exactly 30 minutes 3 times. And then since a couple hours ago when everyone simultanously got DCd, nobody I know has been disconnected since then.
---
I mean if you don't want to believe me, that's fine, no skin off my back.
---
You did it, the crazy son of a bitch did it!
---
I got all the way through to the payment screen and then it died again.
---
College wasn't very demanding for me. State university with a dual major in CS and math. Was able to play probably 5-6 hours a day (raiding 2 nights a week) with ~2 hours left over for homework if necessary. I never skipped class to play WoW (although I did skip a lot of classes for other reasons). Finished with a 3.91 GPA, which qualified for summa cum laude. 
---
Now I have a 8-5 and will definitely have much less time to play, but still quite a lot.
---
For anyone making a Troll:  If you don't go with the biggest tusks available, you are by definition, a failure of a Troll.  A weakling.  A scourge to be fed to the Alliance.
---
i'm at work. my girlfriend was going to get me on the character select in about ten minutes and i was going to rush home to click the button at 5pm. don't think phone would do well for 2 players. :(
---
Cause it's shit advice.
---
I agree maybe after a while it's understandable to use an addon for that at some point but I feel like it's easier to just search up the Quest most of the time.
---
This is legit. I even have got Thunderfury from a boar.
---
23500 atm
---
No idea.
---
No it really hasn't this guy is asking a simple question that I also was confused by.
---
I'm not talking about a fucking bucket of ben&amp;jerry's, you mongrel! Or am I? :o
---
It's because everyone without a sub despiretly tries to get in the shop but it crashes every time
---
I subbed 10 minutes ago and it worked fine for me.
---
Can confirm doesn't work
---
Same. Bigglespeeps unite!
---
The surveys told us this, but everyone was like "all the servers are gonna be the same dawg."
---
Just downloaded wow matrix and it worked without a problem. Thanks for the suggestion!

Oh Yeahhh

Ah, good news.

---
\+1 to your girlfriend--the real MVP.
---
the spanish have decided to roll there within the last couple of hours
---
wait hold up  i didn't understand that 2nd bit.
---
They clear everyone a half hour before, whats that mean? Basically i can get in queue at 2:30?
---
They thought they didn’t, but they did...
---
Hope so!
---
I have Questie, MRP, and Tukui. 
---
Are there any other critical addons I need?
---
I know about the SP episode and I watched him do it the first time just wondering why he would do it again lol
---
Got to wait till i get home from work 19 hours after the servers go live, part of me is hating that fact but seeing screenshots of some of the queues already (half an hour before launch) is making me think that i'm possibly in the best situation! Cant wait to start and see everyone else in game!
---
You can farm shards in AV. Soul shards are really not something to worry about. 
---
Buffing everyone ever 5 minites though on a paladin? Thats something I wouldn't touch.
---
Do GFs transfer from RuneScape to WoW?
---
Lions pride inn. The basement.
---
The summary of the whole discussion is that they want to pressure Blizzard into creating a Spanish server. That's why they're all going to Firemaw, so Blizzard is "forced" to open a Spanish server. TBH I kind of understand them. Some of them are saying that they're moving to Golemagg and Sazzrah because the queue is too long. But I'd say that most are staying on Firemaw til they get a Spanish only server.
---
It's not mandatory to rp on rp servers....
---
Those poor rp players. Rp is just a waiting room for those who dont have time for queus

&gt;you've either been logged in way before everyone

How the queues looking?

Kids: DaaaaaAAaad! Do you love the game more than us?
---
Dad: Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to, little buddy.
---
ah ok. I must not have ever hit that. Just sitting on the character screen waiting.
---
Thank you OP for bringing back this classic experience
---
I was timing my queue so that i can get in before the 30 minutes DC, but apparantly that was removed. rip
---
Ah, finally time to bring this back from 2004.
---
https://dagobah.net/flash/wow_waiting.swf
---
I’m in kinda the same boat. My dumbass waited until last night to even download the game like the casual I am. B.net had an update that wouldn’t do anything or let me start the game download. Finally got it to start and went to bed only to wake up with both of them still “initializing” fml. Leaving the office now and just gonna try to fully uninstall everything related to b.net and then reinstall when I get home. Best of luck!
---
BFA is the diablo mmo they never made
---
Benthic/itemization = Blood shard gambling

I'm something akin to a puddle of sweat right now

Ah my man, thanks for that one. Confirmed dodge from me it is :D

If you're in a queue it won't disconnect you
---
What is dead may never die

Seriously as someone who is teaching a biology course mostly comprised of first years, it scares the hell out of me to imagine one of my students taking this advice and playing all day and missing class. They would fail. Period. Don't do this. Especially if you are a STEM major.

Golemagg is standing on 14.2k queue and rising...
---
can't purchase subscription on eu :(
---
#INCENDIUS HAS A QUEUE NOW! WTF
---
Btw is there an incendius discord?
---
anyone who says you will be kicked after 30 mins is misinformed, or giving false info. iv been logged in for 2 hours now in char selection
---
I literally just tried to sit in character select about an hour ago and it logged me out after 30 minutes and then relieved in and I’m still sitting at character select.
---
Is there an addon available for Classic like Bagnon or Onebag that shows your inventory in 1 window?
---
is this a viable option cos i'll do it...
---
i am SOOOO excited!!! holy heck.
---
Thanks for making me notice this game breaking bug
---
Very excited as well!
---
Do I just need to pick up a subscription through battle.net to play or is there more to it? Already downloaded the client
---
Was the 30 minute auto kick removed?
---
You all think the "Enter World" button will turn red or a restart will happen?
---
Not really a thing for speed running. Only did this to get a different zone with the other ally peeps
---
At Character Selection screen on Pagle...waiting for the orgasm button to activate
---
Over an hour for the most populated, I believe.
---
FYI for anyone concerned, the 30 minute timer is no longer a thing. I've been timing it and have two accounts logged in for 52 minutes on the character screen.
---
If you had to moderate fourteen thousand different posts restating the exact same thing everyone is experiencing right now you would do the same.
---
I got on 5 minutes ago and its 60 min ha. Whitemane
---
IF I could find a guild that wanted to raid after 9pm i probably would.
---
Fuck it’s actually happening
---
Look at this alliance scrub
---
I can assure you Herod is already over 15k in queue now. You just beat everyone to it.
---
I'm an orc who will be going for the raptor mount -- should I run straight to the troll village upon logging in to quest?
---
Just logged into shazzrah right away no queue, it’s a full server too
---
How's Fairbanks Q looking?
---
Well I'm on the character select screen. Guess I beat the queue!
---
Tell them your patrolling azeroth for predators - it should count.
---
Wherever you are, thanks for asking the question. You must have felt really bad with that response, but it surely paid off. A true hero.
---
Unplug the router
---
I been in over a hour.. just don’t log out there’s queues everywhere
---
I literally just finished my (hopefully) last ever college exam today so i am ready to start binging! (Until I get a job I guess. But I'll sort that shit out later).
---
Live to win!
---
Can anyone confirm Thalnos queue time currently?
---
Cheers, got it installed and waiting to go :)
---
Well I'm an asshole IRL so it works for me. It's also the national server for my country so two points for it.
---
longest 30 minutes of our lives, boys
---
Is it true that we get kicked after 30 minutes in character selection screen?
---
I've been in for over an hour and a half. You just need to be active on the login screen, I've just been creating and deleting characters every 20 minutes
---
do we log in now??
---
Anyone else desperately trying to sub? lol
---
Incendius is where I'm placing my chips tonight. C'mon baby don't let daddy down
---
Hi ion
---
Full now :(
---
I would like this answered too
---
16k que 2 hours estimate
---
Shazz is sitting at about 22k Q at the moment so its fucked here too.
---
Aw it's even lamer than I thought it was, I figured it was like the ESA or something
---
How do I escape the crippling feeling of rejection?
---
Could tank for you once my feral is there.
---
Hey, if i log on before launch time and start spamming "enter world" will that work or will i have to relog to join?
---
What was this about logging out and in 28 minutes before?
---
Alliance, Want that instant BG at phase 3 :D
---
I’m on my lunch break and I can’t eat because I’m too excited
---
Question: Do I need to redownload the game from Battle.net or will the version I have that I was using for private servers work?
---
Tried to save a character's look by naming it NiceLooking until I thought of some name for it. You know how it ended.
---
More often than not googling something brings up threads like these.  Therefore if people didn’t ask on here, they wouldn’t show up in the google search.  Just let people communicate within the community.

I’m 1407 to get into whitemane :D

See you this weekend boyos let's gooooo!
---
In character select screen already, thank god.
---
Druid.
---
Good job on the winning and kiddo calling.
---
Yeah that wasn't at all the case on name reservation day, so I gotta call bulllllshit.
---
What are the queue times for faerline?
---
Or do it in advance not hours before release like a total scrub
---
&gt;This won't work because   
---
&gt;any  
---
&gt; content they try to put out will get shot down for failing to meet some section of the playerbase's criteria for the classic vision.
---
If it works for OSRS it will work for this.
---
It s the only decent Sylvanas rig I could find, I would have love to find some of her older model !
---
That’d definitely be the ideal outcome. That’s what happened with osrs and Jagex - the “spin-off” legacy game totally lapped the main game in at least interest and general engagement, if not profits (who knows). I’d say that’s just about the most humbling thing that can happen to you as a developer - your flagship game sporting a decade+ of your best development efforts/decisions gets trounced by a “shitty” 10 year old version with none of that. I can’t think of anything else that could better lay bare your missteps than that. And indeed, Jagex was an extremely arrogant and iron fisted developer when I left that game in 2008 or whatever, far worse than blizzard has ever been. But today the osrs team is amazing, and I think that’s a big reason why. 
---
I want classic to do well if for no other reason than that. Blizzard has made a huge number of mistakes with WoW and this is the best chance we’ll probably ever get to unequivocally and inescapably demonstrate that to them, by rocketing classic straight past retail in numbers and interest. Hopefully.
---
You're sort of right.  I was thinking of Felheart when I said that ... but Nemesis does sort of have horns.
---
Thalnos is 1351 6 min queue
---
Fuuuuck I'm at work another hour
---
yeah I'm not sure if I would care to do that this time around, but if I ever did I would sure feel stupid not rolling a puny human lol
---
You need to download from blizz.
---
It's less "everything will go wrong" and more "something will always go wrong"
---
Gurubashi is the real original arena
---
From what I recall, there was a trainer in Stormwind.
---
Complaining about layering in the first week is retarded, look at those queues. You really think the orc starting area can support 8k players?
---
How are store bought mounts handled? Do I need to purchase them again once the appropriate content is added?
---
If you relog, you are not playing tonight.  I'd wait it out - servers aren't open to enter yet, I'm sure the queue is working behind the scenes, the UI is probably wrong/bugged.
---
Plz stop my que number will be 2
---
Glitch or that was in vanilla?
---
They have removed the timer, no need to do anything :) Been sitting on character screen for an hour now. If you don't believe me check one of the streamers out.
---
New posts have been locked for a couple hours to try and stem the flood of new posts all talking about the same thing
---
fuck you
---
Are you at least unlimited? Yeah some places have such shit pricing :(
---
I'm horde. So no stockades. Anyone want to meet me in RFC? Please. I'm lonely. Someone help me
---
"Hey what year is it?"
---
"One sec, let me ask that guy."
---
"Hey sir, is Blizzard prepared for the launch of World of Warcraft?"
---
"No."
---
"It's either 2004 or 2019."
---
Hey mate, yes you can, above the launch button in battle. net application is an drop-down menu just choose wow classic
---
I was placed in a queue of 3500 about 20 mins ago.
---
Yea I made sure to switch to the right account. I created the others because I thought I messed up somehow. The subscription is still on my first account but when I'm on the battlenet website with all my WOW accounts, the statuses are blank and nothing is active. It's probably just the server issues.
---
Most full servers have a 20k+ que rn, i think alot of ppl will switch
---
Here I’m sitting with my 1 Gbps up/down connection for 35 a month. Come join us on the dark side of the big oceans!
---
Ahh :( shame. So I need to pay to try it?
---
It's the same, just in reverse. 
---
Actually, come to think of it, it's worse - cos as a Nelf you don't have to do this, you can drown yourself if you swim far enough to the West and just spawn in the Dun Morogh GY - as a Dwarf you'd have to actually walk through Wetlands and get eaten by orcs and crocs.
---
POOOOOOGYYY
---
Stay logged in.
---
Greetings

Majority UK server afaik.
---
Lol what? What makes you think I talked to them otherwise? Do you really prefer resenting strangers rather than teaming up with them? The same exact things you listed are exactly what happen now. Sometimes you part ways, sometimes you keep questing together, sometimes you do a quick thanks. 
---
Just because I didn't type words to a person doesn't mean we didn't "socialize". Maybe if you want to get technical into word definitions I should have phrased it differently, but that's a stupid argument.
---
This is why you don’t wait until the last minute.

EVERY PVP SERVER IS HEAVY/FULL 30 MIN BEFORE LAUNCH. WE READY BOIS

We all win for seeing this post.

They're in the same boat as warlocks on hit tbh.

I just logged on and I am in a 143 minute queue D:
---
lmao casual and classic in one sentence, dm me if you made it to 60, PLEASE
---
It isn't 2:30 pm PST yet when OP posted.  Stop acting like a bully to random strangers.
---
25000 on Firemaw ~80min
---
Hahahahaha
---
Yeah. I was super set on Herod when they first announced it just for the name. Settled on Stalagg once I saw how overpopuated Herod is... Now I'm rolling on Incendius for the same reason. Here's hoping the community on Incendius doesn't die horribly.
---
I'm at 16k que right now on stag
---
Thank you for this.  Was wondering what the queue is like for stal.  yeah 3k isnt bad at all
---
Considering the log in queues, it's pretty much out already.
---
It's unlimited insofar as it's so slow I could never hit a cap anyway.  But no, no throttling necessary lol
---
You can gank them, but no you wont be able to quest, raid, do dungeons, or much else. I'd recommend playing the same faction as them
---
/r/UnethicalLifeProTips
---
anyone know what the timezones are for these?
---
I can guarantee you they will consolidate these servers quickly because most people are going to quit after the first month.
---
Transfers from dead realms will probably be free or even automatic.  Paid transfers to non-maxed-severs will likely be available before the holidays.
---
Haha....... :(
---
So if a server is full like the one I'd like to use (Mankrik) but we are 20 minutes out and there's still no queue... am I still running the risk down the road of having to deal with crazy queues? Or at this point if a server is listed as full and still has no queue, does that mean it may not be as dire as we heard? Or is this something no one knows the answer to?
---
bug, its killing everyone LMAO
---
Well Fairbanks didn't shape up to be too bad.  Only around 1k in the queue and I'm already at the char select screen after \~5mins
---
9 min...
---
17,000 Stalag now lol. Says 197 more mins for me!
---
Biggleboi baby
---
I want a Dutch server :(

Don't forget the episode where Fry visits him mom in her dreams!

blizz knows what they're talking about lol
---
just hit level 3, loving classic
---
Emerald Dream is epic but also very toxic. Its kindve a no holds barred place. Lots of us are going to play on Grobbulus so ot might end up being similar.
---
Am in the queue but forgot to install addons, I added them now but will they work without a client restart?
---
I will be Aegon on Incendius (human warrior)
---
Lets go!!
---
By "its been disabled" do you mean that you won't get kicked, or do you mean moving your character doesn't help?
---
13K on Stagg ; Estimated time 140mins
---
It was my understanding that what they were talking about, and one of the great jokes people had at their expense inaccurately, was that they didn't have the *revision* data.
---
One of the things Ion talked about in the above interview was that they didn't keep logs of every single update. Which means that they didn't have a list of every incremental change they made to Vanilla over time as it evolved to today. 
---
Which is to say, I didn't read that as "we literally do not have and can not come up with a database of what's in WoW at 1.12" but rather "we didn't keep track of how we evolved WoW to work on modern architecture and would have to build it by hand."
---
Which they resolved by importing the database data into the modern architecture *instead* of taking the vanilla client and server and porting them forward wholesale.
---
Honestly its preference, a lot of people don't seem to like leveling in the Nelf start zone and i imagine it'll probably be the quietest of the low level area's - I'd say you're best off staying put or maybe having him meet you in Auberdine because its going to be chaos particually in Elwynn/SW 
---
From memory it takes about an 45 minutes to an hour but i'm having to go back a lot of years here
---
Top tier post
---
I missed the conversation about Blizzard disabling the 30-minute auto-kick earlier today. Logged in at 5:31pm EDT and there's a 17,000 person queue on Herod. Also, the server that just launched today (Incendius) is already listed as "Full".
---
\#RIP
---
This secret change they did is honestly kind of fucked up. It's like if we did research and were prepared we have now been punished for it. Cool. Nice.
---
It's not the "cave" layout, though.  It's the "barrow den" one, and this version has *layers.*
---
The worst part for me was trying to remember which one(s) of the 4 thingeys I'd already collected, because I could never keep straight which one was where.  I always ended up back at one I'd already looted at least a few times.
---
[Holy crap!](https://i.imgur.com/JWunpRf.png)
---
It’s because it’s the BFA client I think. Cdew just mentioned on his stream
---
A few days ago you could get dcd mid character creation
---
Yeah, my server is chill. 
---
Too bad they didn't announce it.
---
Good luck to ya!
---
Already on medium.
---
Was he hosting this on the $3/mo tier or something?
---
Warriors are probably the worst solo levelers in the game.
---
Not really. Lots of quests are faction specific and you can't do damage to members of your faction. Make an alliance char and a horde char
---
Doth he have a name?
---
Hello fellow people , i found cool trick if you press escape button during queue or character list you will see a hidden easter egg by blizzard. (i especially recommend doing this to people who are on golemagg realm in EU)
---
Sounds groovy.
---
Generally Warrior, Rogue &amp; Mage are the most popular.  Hunter, Warlock, Priest following.  Shaman/Hunter near the bottom and druid at the bottom.
---
That's how it was in Vanilla
---
I got disconnected after 10 minutes. I want to die
---
The dedicated final thread before lock. See you on the other side boys
---
Thanks Guys I am installing !!! So Excited.
---
Because the server wasn't full initially, the queue was being depleted to fill the server - now that the server is full, the queue will stop going down until there is room.  Thus, the time until you get in now rises as it will take exponentially longer.
---
lol F.
---
NO MAGE ONLY ORC
---
Well hey, I wonder why you didn't have a queue then... Some mysteries may never be solved...

---
I figure there's a streamer and his poggers heading over there.
---
Dang it!
---
f*ck! I thought i was smart logging in 23:40 to have 10 mins for safety if it opened late xd
---
Is this for Real?
---
 IM IN
---
One hour queue already lmao
---
So I haven't been paying attention but do we have a rough idea of which normal servers will be horde or ally dominated?
---
I'm in boys. Q MIMIMI, eh?
---
WE'RE IN BOIS
---
Im in
---
IT TURNED RED! LOADING!
---
We in boys
---
We're in! Ngl, genuinely excited.
---
I’m in!!!!! Woooooooo
---
Alright guys I'm back. Didn't think I'd be AFK for 14 years.
---
24K in queue lmao... Oh lawds.
---
Faerlina is a streamer server, so it's not to late to switch servers.
---
Strangely satisfying video! Thanks
---
Maybe you should've gotten in queue earlier
---
We live!
---
It's alive!
---
Hahaha, det er så legendarisk!
---
im in the 12k area for position.. how about you?
---
LETS GO
---
stuck on loading screen, though
---
Feel stupid yet?
---
I hit button
---
Is there going to be a queue again after the queue to get into the realm??
---
Anyone else on Mograine Horde?
---
L E T M E I N
---
Here we go brothers and sisters!!!! 
---
LOK’TAR OGAR
---
 Bigglesworth is live!
---
I’m hearing that Firemaw has a longer que, and they had 3 new PvP servers to choosw with no que. How was this a good decision on their part?
---
Unfortunately my friends can’t be convinced to switch
---
STUCK ON LOADING SCREEN
---
It just turned red, I'm at the loading screen. The loading bar is stuck half way.
---
How much does it cost to make a new guild?
---
ITS HERE!!!!!
---
Loading screen stuck at 90%. C'mon servers don't fail me now.
---
I logged out to shower and get food then came back at 5 to log back in. R.I.P.
---
oh my god im in
---
17900
---
Stuck on loading screen lol
---
Did anyone elses game crash???
---
That was hell. I'd never want to do that again!
---
We're in girls and boys! :O
---
It's working!
---
Aaaaaand... It's dead.
---
FOR THE MOTHER FUCKING ALLIANCE
---
I'm not in. I'm at work GODDDDAMNIT
---

---
Load plis
---
Right there with ya. Hopefully we some drops in the queue.
---
Now I noticed it’s only on that character named fresh poo the other cow character looks perfectly fine
---
I’m in!!
---
Lol we all are
---
Because I used proper grammar and didn't act like a retard?
---
I'm in!
---
You can still get into the character creation screen, you wont be able to log into the world until it launches tho, which is right now i believe. I've been in the Queue for an hour an my position is around 4000
---
My friend is 17000 in queue for Stallag lol.
---
Dump her
---
How did it go full within an hour?
---
Stuck at 90% loading screen.
---
Oh you're good then. You either beat the queue or your server doesn't have one. I was 5K in line 45 minutes ago and 2.2K now.
---
same
---
Anyone else still loading the last 10% or so?
---
aw yeah, stuck in loading!
---
at 24k with 326 min ETA
---
What about playing with friends?
---
Whitemane queue for me is 18,000. ETA 250 min
---
Were stuck on loading screen bois! Reeeeeeee!
---
In hindsight probably shoulda waited a few minutes to login
---
45 minutes queue on Grobbulus. Goddamn.
---
Imagine on Herod or Faerlina...
---
The loading bar is stuck! Let me in! LET ME IIIIIN!!!!!!!
---
LOAD PLEASE JESUS CHRIST
---
Appears most if not all PVP server are qued up. So godspeed ya crazy PVPers (although I will be one soon enough). 
---
Also knew nothing about streams until this sub, and now my old ass its gonna stream, lol. Jumping into the WORD as I type!!
---
16k, estimated 215 minutes atm
---
It lets you in eventually, my friend got the enter word 30 sec before me and hes in and running around
---
NO. LOADING SCREEN! DON’T DO THIS TO ME!
---
Same :(
---
Are there any NA (PVP) servers that currently don't have over an hour queue time?
---
I think we killed it
---
7k queue on mograine right now
---
stuck on loading
---
10 silver
---
Thank you! Is there anywhere I could find out which classes are the best outside of those two?
---
Stormwind-ironforge trams, in the tunnel about halfway, on a RP server

yea im in university but i will have work too, soooo yea.... definitely wont be able to play 24/7
---
I'm in stalagg at 23060 lol
---
If you get an ironfoe, get the proc and talk to a dwarf you can communicate while the buff is up!
---
3 hour queue here, and I've been in it for 30 minutes already.
---
SAME
---
Got lvl 2! Now im reading login tips..
---
Firemaw gang checking in. Still 15k to go. What madness.
---
I queued for Whitemane 30~ minutes before launch and am still waiting in queue. Only 100 minutes more to go! 😞
---
I’m wondering just what parameters blizzard has for a successful launch. Like, is it to give a good experience or a low number of server rack fires?
---
Y’all think we gotta relog if we’re getting the world server is down message every time we try
---
Can't play current WoW while waiting in queue for classic, ugh..... smh
---
Me too... Is it bugged?
---
Same here.
---
I see the complaining has already begun.
---
Twitch views over a million and rising!
---
just unplug the Overwatch servers we wont need em for awhile
---
its a good thing blizzard tried so hard to avoid empty servers, some of these realms are barely populated
---
Just tested, got a 9k queue.
---
I'm not talking about the queues, the game is a lag-fest. Remember when layering was supposed to make the launch super smooth? Remember when layering was supposed to negate the need for queues? Remember when layering was supposed to solve overpopulation and make the starter zones a breeze? Looks like you guys were wrong about layering. Time to throw in the towel and admit it. It's just hilarious to me, but of course as I expect, you guys will continue to exercise your mental gymnastics to defend your favorite company.
---
same. where you at now?
---
16,183 in queue, 248 min on Stalagg. This is... brutal. Queue time hasn't changed much in the past half hour, either.
---
skarem, sitting at 10,733
---
I thought it meant that he’s good lol. I don’t really know what I’m talking about, I just support him haha
---
How my position in queue go *up*? It's usually only by 1, but it's really annoying when it's barely going down at all. 436 on Incendius currently.
---
How do I add a macro?
---
ootl  Here. What was the phone comment?
---
Yes its what wow was back in 2006.  Very different game.
---
We bought diapers for him don’t fret
---
can you afk while in queue?
---
I've been in Blau queue for 20 minutes.
---
Does anyone know what kind of ETA it would be for a world server to come back online? Sorry new and idk if they've ever mentioned it before
---
Looks like that was the peak.  Pretty incredible.  I would think that’s beat any previous xpac blizz released
---
Launch is at midnight?
---
Same :/
---
12k in queue, 180 min left
---
I'm literally the only one of my 6 friends that isn't in. This sucks.
---
So I don't mind that I didnt get in directly at launch but is anybody worried these queues will be around for weeks? I'm not sure why Blizzard is so sure the servers will die off if they add more.
---
ah. can't get into servers. those that are in getting D/C'd due to lag. love this authentic vanilla experience. hope they have the loot bug too!
---
JÄVLAR
---
I loaded in right away. Was surprised as all hell
---
True.  I'm thinking some of my theoretical people might want to see 95%+ to where each coast of the US would have a single low to medium population PVE and PVP server.
---
I'm at 8080 with 124 min this sucks.
---
22k queue
---
I like it.
---
ify i still need to delete my characters and remake them probably gonna get my name snagged
---
i don't think there's anything you can do besides from wait if it's already been escalated. and if you genuinely don't know why you were banned, then my guess would be someone else gained access to the account at some stage and used it for nefarious purposes. they will unban you when they actually look at your ticket if this is the case
---
Been stuck on "28 minutes" for about 30 minutes. Position in queue is actually rising. How does that even work?
---
EU PyreWood Village - no queue, world server down.
---
Yeah, think I'll just choose a newer low pop pvp instead, lvl to 60, gear a bit then transfer to Shazzrah in a few months.
---
It is at 1.1M right now!
---
fuuuck, hope i dont regret playing on shazzrah in 2 months
---
Because in 2 weeks those extra servers will probably be dead. THIS is a typical launch. Massive influx for the first days and the everything disperses. More smart than laughable. Then they would need to merge servers together causing unnecessary work.
---
You will be IP banned you will not be able to play from your current address
---
It’s a brisk 43 Celsius to walk around campus for school where I am, and I unfortunately I can’t play for the first 36 hours because of my schedule! ☹️. You look like you have a nice set up and I’m a little jealous
---
Grob is queued up. I'm at position 3407 with 60 minutes estimated.
---
340min que for stalaag. fuck me man
---
I don't expect to get in tonight. I'm still excited to leave work in an hour and ten minutes to sit in queue.
---
proxy?
---
You sure will :) !
---
more like retail servers lol
---
Have you ever played something at launch?
---
i'm at 16171 with 248 minutes on Stalagg
---
Starting my master now, so still have to be in school quite alot. But, based on my experiances from the workplace, I will still have alot more time then you poor soules who have to work. I will play some for you!
---
I don't know I'm not trying tho lolololo
---
When searching do -asmongold
---
We all did and told them to add more servers. They didn't...
---
should be fine, i've been in queue for 50 mins now
---
Tbh wow Classic is way more casual friendly if you actually lvl up to 60.
---
&gt;e to lag. l
---
yeah, no problem
---
mine has been stuck at 240 people for 10 minutes :(
---
World server down shazzrah pvp
---
I'm reliving November 2004 and am loving it.
---
21 mins ago
---
Probably people already logged in disconnecting and reconnecting, believe there's a grace window to let them back in.
---
are you from EU?
---
My friend asked me if they were going to keep the classic experience authentic and make the game unplayable at launch because of queues.  He hit it on the nose.
---
Everyone's there for the big event of the launch. Wouldn't be surprised if 80%+ of those players drop out before lv40, though?
---
type /m or /macro and the macro interface should open up
---
Kill some boars for me.  Stuck at work can't play until 6:(
---
I have been stuck at 483 for 20 minutes now.. it keeps jumping 482-483
---
I brought lots of activities for myself to stay busy while he plays 😌
---
That’s a great question, osrs has added a lot of new content but I’d be surprised if wow adds that much.
---
Lol, people has been queuing before the launch. I got into it at &lt;1' and decided to switch to another one. Bad decision lol.
---
Anyone able to join Firelash? Been stuck on loading and "World server down" .
---
Bout 300 min away
---
Guys, this rando has it figured out. This dude on the internet. Not blizzard, this guy.
---
Ah, my new enemy. 
---
Good to meet you
---
Anyone else getting "World server down" on Mograine?
---
Yeah, its like a flip top locking cap. works pretty good but I never use it outside my PC room so I just leave it off
---
Blizzard incompetence as usual. Change the rules 2 hours before launch while only notifying streamers about it.
---
you don't have a premium sub clearly 😁
---
My queue is moving from 35 to 34 then back to 35 and nothing is happening. Did a relog, relaunched game too, nothing happens. :|
---
I logged into mograine 29 mins before release and got put in 4k queue, at 1.3k atm
---
Same here. Very confusing lol.
---
One shadow dps was good for the healing ironically
---
Bruh. I can’t even move
---
be polite yet persistent  blizzard has pretty good customer service usually
---
Ignore the timer.
---
Same, everyone needs to relax. This is Blizzard at it's most pure. It will calm down eventually. We should be happy that the game is getting this much attention and let them figure it out, it's not going to stay like this.
---
harbor was added in wrath to get to boreal tundra
---
Ive been sub 3000 for over a half hour. Its not moving at all.
---
What server?
---
I’m stuck at work till 8. I feel ya.
---
Eh it’s okay! I know that my boyfriend is going to be very invested in the game and I don’t want to distract him. I’m here whenever he needs a kiss or two :)
---
Sorry, I was trying to let you know it's not actually 100 minutes until you log in. I have been at 100 minutes for the past 70 minutes. The queue continue to goes down but the time does not budge.
---
its streamers logging in with their privileges!
---
Yup lol, I think you’re literally right in front of me
---
Lol EU subscription pages are down and US sub pages have an hour queues, rip :D
---
bUt LaYeRInG wIlL FiX aLl oUr pRoBlEmS!!!
---
good to know, given that my spot in the queue makes sense so i won't do anything stupid like re-entering the que.
---
sorry, i personally don't know anyone who is online :/ i should perhaps find the gehennas discord and see what people are saying there
---
How did all the streamers manage to avoid this queue?
---
I dont think most people understand how the queue works. People have to leave before new people can join and that ain't happening a lot between now and probably midnight.
---
what server you playing on?|
---
Anyone waiting to get into Faerlina?  If so what's your position and time?  I'm 8050 and 103 minutes ayoooooooooooooooo
---
Hahaha really? How many people are showing up in the starter place. I saw the stress test would have 6 or so people in the zone.
---
What server is he on?
---
WTF was the point of name reservations... Couldn't they have locked those servers down for just the people who reserved names... The servers were already full.. now I face the situation where I can either play and lose my name or wait hours to get in. I want a refund for last months sub
---
Ouch. Some tough zones along that path. Lol.
---
Does it matter if I start on a low population realm? 
---
My friends and I just want to play without waiting for 2 hours haha. 
---
I’m assuming the low population realms will fill up eventually?
---
I am right now on 4687. Curious how long will that take
---
Unfortunately your friend has more fun than you do
---
I don't have classes until 2:30 so I'm with you on that lol
---
Same thing happened to me.
---
So much for disconnect protection...
---
I got 40 min to go, been thinking of classic the entire day lol been rough...
---
where can i find server distribution numbers?
---
It's just frustrating because this has happened before. Did you try to play Diablo 3 on launch? It was literally unplayable. 
---
I feel like Blizzard knew damn well this would happen and they simply don't care. They're just pinching pennies.
---
blizzard is acting like this is new to them...
---
disappointing to say the least
---
Got in right away, but too many players for too few wolves. I‘ll check in tomorrow afternoon
---
Quick question, are you trying to make a human or dwarf/gnome?
---
I’ve been stuck around position 2200 saying 30min wait for the past hour now, should I just quit and log in again? My friend got kicked and was able to sign back into the realm immediately so i don’t know if I should do the same.
---
Easy to level, warlock had "free" mount on lvl40. Getting the 100g needed is very hard by then. Hunter are a bit easier.
---
yea totally - Pyrewood Village
---
This has been done a million times, put it to bed already Zzz
---
Sounds like something got the whole bait and switch. Instead of coffee they got their tits kicked off.
---
Have been stuck at &lt;1min for 30 min. Moved 3 spots. Thank you blizzard
---
yep.. what a time to be alive
---
It's back to medium.
---
estimated wait time &lt;1 for like 10 minutes, it lies.
---
Cute response, but no that's a bad idea; like you said, nobody wants dead servers when the initial wave dies down and the population levels off. 
---
The answer is dveloping and/or allocating proper network infrastructure to support the expected traffic into the servers. 
---
I guarantee you that more people logged into the WoW servers day 1 of BfA worldwide compared to today and the login servers didn't have this kind of nightmare.
---
you could log in to the server like an hour before launch
---
That's my plan at this point. Good excuse to actually make dinner and not eat a frozen pizza.
---
Krom let me in but I’m getting the same world server down problem I had on Stalagg
---
Just gonna play witcher until I log in 🤷
---
Waste of space he is
---
For real, how can people be complaining about this? I fully expected today to be a shitshow and all I wanted to get done today was to make sure my addons worked. So while waiting, a quick thunder storm popped up (florida) and flashed my power and internet went out for a second after being in queue for 25min... All I could do was laugh. Anyway my 11 day vacation starts later this week, that's when the fun begins. 
---
Hopefully..
---
Privilege.
---
352, I feel ya
---
Yea man I'm down from 175 to 158, my buddy is down from 59 to 50 lmao.
---
every time i see one of these i feel like a dingus for not getting one, same with a shitton of other blizz merch they've done in the past :/
---
Got pretty excited hitting 2k in the queue on Whitemane.
---
They were all on the character select screen for hours. I got on the char select screen 2 hours prior. No queue for me.
---
anyone trying to enter pagle? well i cant
---
Looks like the Blizz post was updated and now Kromcrush is PvP East instead of PvE: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/two-new-wow-classic-realms-are-now-open/269532
---
Ye im not gonna play tonight lul, rekt by blizzard as usual. Yet asmogold and co are instantly in..
---
Lol dude, this is like event of decade, if the server isn't down, I would say it is prepared enough.
---
This is the same thing as every other massive game launch, unless this is new to you, you shouldnt be surprised. If you dont support them or enjoy them, you dont have to play, there are other MMO's you can can play with 0 queue times. They didnt have to make classic wow at all. There are plenty of people outside of your enclosed bubble enjoying the game as of right now. Including half a dozen of my friends.
---
is there any resource showing the servers they're adding ad hoc? google isn't showing anything useful
---
Going to be logging in around midnight lol. Too bad im at work because it seems i would have to begin queue now to get in by then lol.
---
Increasing queue position... anyone else getting that?
---
I get stuck with about 20% left on loading screen for Bloodsail. Anyone else having this issue?
---
Unless you are choosing a realm to play with a specific person or time zone, then the low ones are the way to go if you have the choice.  They'll fill up.
---
But what if the VR is fully immersive and you can sit drinking whiskey in a tavern in Skyrim while you ignore the fate of the world to get drunk and and flirt with the big tiddied tavern wench?
---
So I keep getting the World Server is down for Pagle, yet there are people streaming playing on it currently?
---
How does that work?
---
I'm sititng at character selection screen. It won't let me and many in as it says World Server Down.
---
So you're not missing much.
---
56 in stalagg come on please
---
all big streamers are fine to play.. lol gg blizzard
---
Thank god for layering.
---
Dude, I deal with time warner/spectrum, who are supposed to be the devil, but after dealing with Comcast for a decade, they seem like SAINTS!
---
many people wont be able to play tonight even if they were home, so don't fret too much. The newest west coast PVP server has a 4000 person queue that is going about 10 per minute
---
"I promise a lot of things" lol
---
Wish I knew.
---
2182 estimated 30mins, been here over an hour now
---
Mograine EU (PvP)
---
Position in queue: 1900
---
Est. time: 36 min
---
You know things are bad when you get a 3 hour wait time and it increases after a few thousand people log in
---
it's almost like reddit consists of people of varying opinions
---
the one opposite of west
---
I don’t. I just wanna play the game lol
---
Are we honestly surprised? Even the BFA launch was riddled with login issues for hours. 
---
But... "no wOrrIeS! LaYerIng wiLl fiX iT aLL!"
---
estimated time: 25 minutes
---
40 minutes later: estimated time: 26 minutes
---
Ahn’Qiraj or bust! SM’s in the undead starting zone.
---
“WORLD FIRST SKERAM WIPE, SIX L9 PLAYERS”
---
shocking
---
I'm at 5900 on Faerlina. could be worse
---
FROM games are casual unfriendly and they're like picture book material for good game design. Good art always serves a niche. When you want to serve everyone you just end up with watered down shit
---
Kromcrush already getting World Server is down
---
That orc walking away is what got me XD
---
It could change. But they said there wouldn’t be a wow classic maintenance outage tomorrow
---
And yet, Whitemane (western realm) has a 2 hour+ queue.
---
He wants to abuse his position to control the opposing faction on a PvP server.  How is that playing like a normal person at all?  And how does he know if he's being streamsniped, killed by a random ganker, or spotted and called out in general chat because he's well known and a group or raid forms to camp him?
---
No you don't
---
Idiot
---
I think so, granted I don't recall what the numbers were when BFA released last year.
---
I joined Incendius earlier today just to see if there’d be queues, I feel like if they added 1-2 more realms it’d be okay lol
---
I was 630, lying in bed reading  this thread. I just got DC’d and had to log back in, it re qued to 8600 them dropped me back into my spot at 630 again.
---
Super happy for the grace period lol.
---
Got in to Bloodsail Buccaneer, only now it says the world server is down.
---
This... Somehow makes me feel better about my 84 min estimated time.
---
Looks like Shaper Mod items for PoE
---
Don’t know how that is but it’s hilarious. “Yeah... I promise not to do a lot of things.”
---
Which do you play?
---
They get priority.
---
nah i already made an orc warlock
---
The point was to reserve name on a specific server.  No more, no less.  This is launch day, and happens every single time.  Be patient and get something to drink :)
---
I didn't realize they would be up for queue early...I only started right at 3:00 and so I'm at #4000
---
I hope 3 hours is enough time ha
---
I am an optimistic person...
---
Eh... My 980ti wasn't able to maintain 120fps at 3440x1440 on max graphics settings during the stress tests (including AA, not including render scaling beyond 100%). 
---
So I'm actually glad I updated my GPU.
---
Right? At least that was good for a laugh
---
smoking and drinking surely is the only way to have fun guys right?
---
My favorite part is watching my position in queue go up. It goes down for a bit then back up.
---
They are concerned about dropoff in a month
---
Imagine they open 50 so everyone could just play with no wait today
---
Not saying the are doing it right, but that's why
---
I feel like they are getting special treatment. They probably have a backend priority reserve.
---
I changed out of skeram, came back into a lower position longer time.  Shit is wack
---
Or be a man and face your fears and play ret pally
---
Tf??
---
Im in retail right now and it is actually pretty full. I know i couldnt get into the server i wanted to, i guess ill have to wait a few hours or until tomorrow.
---
"The Classic Experience"^TM
---
I think I found [the guy](https://youtu.be/0Wrw3c2NjeE?t=13) who decided how many servers to host.
---
oof. Yeah, I wasn't there for that.
---
Seems like using WoW as your standard for launches is probably not a good idea.
---
No I know,
---
I’m no hero class
---
Guys. Keep calm. There is a limit how much you can load balance. Or cluster servers. That's why they created layering back in the days or cata and mop. Because every launch is a fuckfest to deal with.
---
I'm a sysadmin myself and trust me, you can't just throw 200 server blades into infrastructure and it works magically. There is a limit on how much you can cluster. There simply are some bottlenecks that can't be optimized much.
---
So right now it seems there are some million players storming the servers and networks. It was to be expected, that there will be some hiccups and it will take some time for blizzard to react to it. I'm.sure they upping up the performance with additional hardware right now, but this also takes time.
---
Honestly, compared to other games blizzard launches usually are quite without bigger problems.
---
Just wait a bit.
---
Some hours later the situation will most likely solve itself.
---
BB love!
---
3 months of login queues is still more gameplay than all of BFA combined
---
I sat on character selection for 2 hours and after playing 4mins I got dc'd. 15k queue fuck yeah!
---
I was too but im back in que. 12k baby haha..
---
"Not the actual launch experience"
---
Stalagg 12.8k checking in, started at 18.3k 80 minutes ago, still estimates 330 minutes to complete now
---
Still one of my favorite South Park episodes.
---
Back when I played classic, there was an add on similar to Kaydee. It would track similar things for whatever toon you are on, but it was only specific to that toon and was not shareable.
---
I really like that you brought something like this back. As a person who loves PvP and world PvP, this is something I’d utilize fully.
---
They said to expect it on a small number of servers.
---
They could have been bad in the past and still have failed at this release.
---
Pretty similar situation, im at 930 for the last hour. Estimated time has never been over 10 minutes though. Its been a real roller coaster.
---
So just keep trying to log and it worked for you?
---
25,0000 here on Stalagg
---
Can't wait till yall get in.  We're here waiting for boars and cheering you on.
---
It does have a lot to do with preparation. I've handled far worse than this in terms of traffic at my job (think black friday but worse type events) but the amount of sheer traffic and active connections in a game like this is orders of magnitude more than I have ever handled.
---
Skipped the queue for Herod, but got disconnected randomly and hit with this [error message](https://i.imgur.com/2gve29Q.jpg) after about a half hour of playing - well, inasmuch as contesting boars with hundreds of other players can be called "playing." Guess I'll have to go be productive for a few hours or something.
---
On list: Server population - Medium
---
Log in to server: SERVER IS FULL POSITION IN QUEUE OVER 9000
---
Mage is never the wrong answer. There will be lots of them, but there is good reason for that.
---
Quality varies, but I think overall there's a lot more good than bad/mediocre. IMO the movies (season 5) were underwhelming, a lot of it felt like 20-minute stories that were straining to fill 80 minutes. On the other hand the first half of season 6 was an *incredible* run that includes like 5 of my top 10 episodes. Second half of 6 was a little forgettable, but then season 7 was good.
---
I don't he's mad about, it's just a "told you so" kind of stance.
---
Any news on Skeram server anybody???
---
Actually yeah, they usually do. And if the issue persists for multiple days they give multiple days.
---
I've been trying to get in since a little before launch, and I keep getting the world server down loop as well. Sucks
---
I played a lot of vanilla and TBC during college.
---
It taught me a ton about time management and how to complete tasks I set before myself. 
---
15yrs later I like to think I’m pretty successful and am in a good place. 
---
Ah, good times.
---
Same thing happened on both my Macs I think it's just a Mac bug.
---
time to call it a day, glad i didnt take the week off lol
---
Skeram checking in ~1 hr after launch. Server is still down (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
---
Lol I started at 8613 in queue with 420 minutes.. have now gotten to 7893 with 473 minutes. Ewww
---
herod queue is back
---
Razorgore is longer dead than it was alive. World server down.
---
I did 10 push-ups every 5 minutes one session I did 900 push-ups. I got ripped as fuck.
---
They said to expect queues on medium and higher.
---
is anyone getting in on kromcrush? i keep trying to log in &amp; keep getting 'World server is down'
---
Hahaha your plan was foolish, the launch day of vanilla was exactly like this except some people were stuck trying to download the launcher to download the game files. Today a lucky few get in and will be unceremoniously dumped during random DCs all day. This whole week will be rough.
---
It's instant or a few seconds on Kuri and Krom
---
There's a popular build for PVP called Ele-Resto (lame name lol) that is probably good enough to do end game content up until maybe MC. It's certainly good enough for 5 and 10 mans and is a very strong spec in PVP.
---
But for the most part, you'll be healing. If you're friends with your raid leader and you devote yourself to your class and buy consumables for yourself then they might bring you along.
---
I don’t understand how people are being able to play on a server when others are being told world server is down
---
Raise your hand if you got D/Ced after sitting in character select for an hour before the server opened. :D
---
Y’all got any more of them mobs
---
Ah shit, here we go again...
---
*^(and same.)*
---
This is LITERALLY the authentic experience I was so hyped for...
---
I haven't been this excited to watch my position in queue since ~2005ish
---
too scared to log out and check
---
Red inner hoodie guy!
---
dude, it's **queue**. It's literally on your screen right now
---
i'm stuck on "logging into game server" - not even a q :\
---
Indeed. I got to character selection at 00:08 CET(52 minutes ago), but I've gotten world server is down since then.
---
Should've given it a week then.
---
Anyone able to login on Kromcrush? Keep getting world server is down
---
Never streamed in my life and I'm about to hit 7, had no issues other than fighting to tag mobs.
---
They were but it's just too much. What can't you guys understand? Do you know how servers work ? You just know how to complain. You wanted classic you got it , now you found something else to whine about.
---
beautiful, can't wait!!
---
“Mom bathroom!” - Eric Cartman.
---
World of Servercraft :)
---
Yeah I’m getting the same thing
---
Anyone elses screen keep freezing?
---
Full.
---
Ew. Gross. I haven't managed to play yet, so do I wait in queue for 7,300 people on the server my friends and I agreed on? Or do I just roll on a new server with low pop and hope for the best...?
---
I got in, but my friend who literally queue'd 1 min after me has been waiting for the last 190 for an hour.
---
hes at 154 now. :/
---
Facts. Honestly these queues alone are going to cause half the players to stop playing already anyways and then we won’t have login queues anymore
---
I CANT EVEN GET A QUEUE WTF IS THIS SHIT
---
Thanks and good planning on the days off, those are mine as well, plus the following Monday due to labor day. I might expand my vacation to Wednesday at this point as my new place is open now and I might as well move in sooner than later. 
---
Horde or Alliance? I'm going Horde on Skeram and planning to do Warrior first as I normally do. Then it's a toss up between Mage, Warlock, and Shaman. I'll get them all to 60 but not sure in what order. Maybe I'll do a rogue too, so many fun choices really.
---
What part of saying you're going to lift the restrictions and then not doing that doesn't register to you as a fuck up by Blizzard?
---
it truly feels like how it was back in 2004!
---
Open up new servers with affix "2" knowing they will be merged into one once things die down.
---
Lets just hope that Warlock leader doesnt take the tier head you won right off of garr's corpse :O
---
You just described my favourite thing to do
---
&gt; a game isnt a "good" game if it doesnt attract the casual (average) gamer 
---
This is a big load of bullshit. Some of the most acclaimed games ever made are heavily niche oriented: Witcher, WoW Vanilla, Counter Strike, Dota, and so on. And some of the biggest flops out there are games that tried too bad to appeal for everyone: FO 76, BF5, Destiny, Anthem, CoD Post MW2, and so on.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
3911 for me!!
---
one of my friends is in, the rest of us keep getting the server down
---
Is the classic wow client the same as say, playing on a vanilla pserver client? My shitty pc can run vanilla, tbc and wotlk all with 60 FPS but even after putting all my settings down as low as possible the game was extremely laggy for me at only the login screen. I tried this a few nights ago before the launch in attempt to save some names so I didn’t actually get in to play any actual gameplay, sadly. I was expecting to be able to play it with ease.
---
Fellow, sysadmin,
---
Do you think Blizz techs are, crying, screaming, or drowning in coffee right now?
---
All of the above is acceptable.
---
I got you covered brother:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0jxRwp3V5Q
---
and a bunch of ppl said youd get kicked after 25-30 mins even if you created new chars/changed realms etc which was a lie since my buddy has been in for hours prior to avoid the queue
---
yes, me too
---
They said many times medium and over will have queues
---
I leave for 20 minutes and it goes from 140 mins to 265 mins. 
---
Press f.
---
I've never played WoW before because growing up I couldn't convince parents to pay for subscription. Is it worth a shot playing if I've never playing any of the games, but I've played Diablo 1, 2, and 3. Also if it is worth playing, can you give me some helpful resources for beginners so I am not wasting too much time being a noob.
---
Oh hey, that's fucking annoying.
---
Well yeah, usually more than 12ish hours downtime they give another day. Back when WoD was down for 3 days they credited everybody for that time.
---
Also I don't feel bad for anybody who expected to have a smooth login and go on launch day.
---
Same. But already down to 9k with 12 minute que.
---
I don't have the region/account drop down box option. Can anyone help me with it?
---
40! Try 300 😆
---
yep, frost mage is always good and it's not that hard to play.
---
Then create more fucking servers lol its not rocket science.
---
World server down for Pagle.
---
10k 255...
---
Only 178 more minutes to get in whitemane, I joined at 5:30 est ugh
---
This is amazing
---
It really is like I'm back in 2004.
---
What he said.
---
My boi
---
1600 in queue for Herod. I got kicked \~20 min ago during first crash.
---
Looking at these comments I guess I should not log out to set up my add ons
---
Yeh it needs cheering up .. or somethin!
---
Firemaw's turn to crash! RIP. I went from 11k to 3k in queue in 1 minute after nearly 2 hours to get 10k.
---
It says like 38 minute queue but it only took about 15 min or so for the whole process to complete, I just did it.
---
Thats just buying the sub though, game servers are pretty much on fire right now.
---
This is the right answer
---
Yeah!? 
---
Well I’m going to run away from you and try and level and peace, bitch!
---
I’ll definitely play whenever I can get the sub going I won’t spend my whole day playing the game tho but I’ll grind, jnek#21637
---
Just killed Sarkoth thank god
---
150k concurrents is probably the best state RuneScape has ever been in. I don't remember it hitting such highs even at the game's previous 2007 peak.
---
Bigglesworth taught me Medium is the way to go.
---
this is the authentic WoW vanilla experience we wanted.
---
Yeah, it gets stuck to about 85% then the music stops and nothing else happens. Is it the same for you?
---
It might not matter I may never play with this queue time lol
---
The estimate difference between Stalagg and Faerlina, both at 25k, is...interesting.
---
Been in queue for 1 hour 12 minutes. 452nd in queue...
---
I started at only 2325. My buddy is 8900+ in queue.
---
i think the world server is down, my queue is going down but it's probably just because people are giving up lol
---
Shit, we had our file server go down and half the company called us. I wanted to scream at them, "YOU DON'T THINK WE FUCKING KNOW. WE ARE WORKING ON IT. LEAVE US ALONE"
---
Been trying to turn in my completed quest for 10 minutes now it’s painful.
---
jnek#26731 it is !
---
What are the earliest mage and skinning trainers when starting as a troll?
---
No more or less fucked than the rest of us.
---
You think you do... But you don't...
---
Same state as you, getting the world server is down message
---
I was in from the start and it litteraly just tossed me out, try to rejoin position in queue 14000
---
srsly RPPVP is the dream
---
How long did it take for the original wow launch to iron out? I think we can judge blizz on how fast they can resolve this launch rather than the immediate 10-20k queues.
---
SAME ugh!
---
blizzard is doing this on purpose! they want people to move to newer servers
---
If anything the series finale is worth seeing. I don’t mind the last two seasons that much but the finale was a good ending.
---
Up to 20k now.
---
I feel bad for people who chose not to go to work today.
---
9374th for Fairbanks. 70 min estimated time ㅠㅠ
---
:(
---
 I've got bad news for you friend....
---
EU (English PvP) population/queues atm from highest to lowest:
---
Firemaw &gt; Shazzrah &gt; Gehennas &gt; Golemagg &gt; Mograine
---
These realms have no queue:
---
Flamelash / Gandling / Razorgore / Noggenfogger / Stonespine
---
Mods removed it LUL maybe they're already in Sodapoppin's pocket
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/HyperWrongLatteWoofer
---
!remindme 5 days
---
Only the ones that are working.
---
Should have set up HSRP and two different ISPs with unique paths into your house.
---
I was just kicked out and now I'm at 15k in queue.
---
What the fuck.
---
3610 in Q 27 min EST. IM ALMOST THERE GUYS
---
Yes, and I keep getting world server down. On a server that is less than 30 minutes old.
---
no, trying to do it now but the site is janky atm lol guessing alot of people doing it, im trying to lol
---
Apparently people are, think before you type lmao
---
thats mostly cos fortnite's popularity has significantly decreased... misleading at beast
---
5m i guess
---
I don't remotely agree, and I have pretty good evidence in the form of the numerous shitshow launches that this game has experienced over the last 15 years. 
---
The long-term longevity of this game is not going to be defined by one day.
---
Dunno if anyone messaged you, but its been up for about 10 mins
---
Did you see any new servers when getting back on?
---
This probably the worst launch I've experienced. I can't even queue to a server it just kicks me out.
---
I had to enable vertical sync to make it stop
---
Haven't been able to play, just keeps saying 'world is down'
---
wow really 24 hours, that sucks :(
---
I think I might just finish getting my seasonal to 70 in Diablo and wait till tomorrow night to play. If I can tear myself away from the Hype fest or watching my queue slowly lower.
---
Did they turn layering off?  What's the point of layering if I'm going to have 100+ minute queues anyway?
---
Yeah fuck that. I’ll pay for a server transfer later if they’re available. I’m joined Kurinaxx the new Pacific PvP server. Only 1200 queue and almost at high population already
---
You can make a character before getting to the server itself. So the character counts, but then you get World Server Down after a few minutes of loading screen.
---
FML and now in 90 min queue
---
I was in College during TBC and WotLK.
---
TBC I made a rule that I was only allowed to play 1 night during the week, and all day Sunday. During LK, I cheated on my rule and played the shit out of the game which lead to me quitting mid-LK to focus on my studies. Didn't make a comeback until late Mid-Cata once I was working a full-time job.
---
It wasn't a stress test anyway it was a money grab by Activision...
---
plebs btfo
---
I got in,  went to start character up and world server is down so get booted out
---
Surprise surprise
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294723/launch-classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=294723/launch-classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc)
---
You aren't missing out on much.
---
I got on within the first second or so of Classic launching. Upon loading in there were around a few dozen, and over the next few seconds or so a tsunami of bodies began to emerge from the spawn point. The servers utterly collapsed under the weight and it was impossible to play. It took a good 20 seconds for any attack to be processed by the server and the chat system basically ceased functioning.
---
Memorable? Yes. Productive? Absolutely not.
---
And Matthew Mercer

Honestly wtf, I get DC'ed and then put in a 13K queue, fuck Blizzard.
---
Not yet but it seems that you cant connect on any. lol
---
Ah okay, don’t really frequent twitch but jfc 800k+ viewers
---
Lucky dog
---
ohhhhh okay
---
yep, guess no more classic for today, pops also suddently lowered to low, weird.
---
Months
---
I'm so glad I didn't take today off work just to be stuck in queue, almost did, but every time I have for a launch day i've been screwed sitting in queues, so I decided to just skip today.

---
Two more new ones as of 20m ago.
---
Same, rough
---
Those are all very helpful QoL stuff I was looking for. Thanks a lot buddy :)
---
Ask a guard in starting area its probably razor hill for skinning trainer though
---
Haha wow!
---
Yes.  They're already full, dont leave queue.
---
I picked up herbalism but my minimap has no tracking button and I can't find the Find Herbs skill in my skillbook. No addons are on either. Am I dumb?
---
That's cute. WoD is still worse than this.
---
most of the servers are actually up and staying up, this is pretty far from a shitshow. pretty par for the course, actually, and seems to be exactly what they warned us about.
---
I agree with your main point, but it wasn't hard to participate in the stress tests. All you had to do was sign up for the Wow Classic beta on your Blizz account page first. It was hardly "closed."
---
This is dedication
---
ITT everyone QQing about the Queues! This is exactly what I dreamed of. What a time to be alive!
---
agreed. people don't realize that unelss they add another 5 US servers. we are all gonna be waiting 6 hours to play every night. you dont get through a 10k que in under 6 and GL. if you log in at 6pm when u get off work. you arent playing the whole night. mind blowing there isnt another 4 servers
---
Que at 3900, ETA 150min
---
i think it'll take a lot longer than that unfortunately
---
Bend over then
---
I'm on the same server but with 22min and 9.5k position in queue, but I was at ~230min and then it randomly jumped down to 26min
---
Call us when VR has the ability to simulate the soft feel of breasticles against our grizzled adventuring faces.
---
Haha! Good luck!!
---
Am I the only one that gonna play classic when all the hype calms down?
---
Im stuck at work. What do the blowme queues look like?
---
How does one recognize a queue skipper I wonder
---
Is kromkrush world server down for everyone?
---
hi
---
This queue is longer than a CVS receipt.
---
What is the queue like for kurinnaxx? I would check but I dont want to lose my queue spot
---
Hey friend! I'm in your pic! As Fellaguar!! The stress test was really something! As I couldn't take a screenshot back then, I'm just really happy that you posted it here! : )
---
There are. Around half the servers have no queue and are working perfectly.
---
I hope they add character transfers, my intended realm queue is 7 hours :(
---
You think a modern MMO would launch like this? Lmao.
---
what did you expect lol
---
Not by a longshot. I was able to log in right away in WOD. The quest with the two towers sucked, and garrisons were janky for a while, but I could play.
---
Dear Shazzrah,
---
I've been queued since 30 minutes before launch.  It's now 90 minutes later exactly.  Please randomly kick 500 players so I can finally make it through this "4 minute" queue.
---
Your friend,
---
dLo
---
Stalag here 310 minutes 13797 in que
---
What are they supposed to do you mean? The server is full, people want to get in. Therefore people have to queue.
---
Anyone on Bloodsail Buccaneers?  Get in?
---
I did some stuff in bfa unlocked kultiran , dark iron and Maghar , once name reservation came out I deleted all my live characters and un installed . Felt nothing already have more attachment to my level one on classic who has yet to even enter the game.
---
3-4 hour wait on some
---
Lol, thanks. I'm in it for the long haul. See you in game late tonight!
---
Shitty laptop master race.
---
the world server is down, you can get to the character selection screen.
---
Ah, yes. The wonderful gaming industry in 2004 where EA was nickel and dimeing us with The Sims overpriced DLC.. wait I mean expansion packs, instead of skins. Completely different from now. /s
---
On firemaw EU, like 1/4 of the server got kicked (me included) despite fast relog we got back in a 12-16k que.
---
and RNGesus looked down upon Motanum and said "Screw that one in particlar"
---
350 minutes and I started logging in 30 minutes before 3pm.
---
Overall we don’t have as many players, so one server makes sense. After the hype settles a bit, it will be a reasonable number. Queues won’t last long.
---
Just make a toon on a less packed server? Its not like you will lose progress
---
Wait are you saying Blizzard knew this would happen and it still failed? You realize they’ve handled larger launches than this, right?
---
I was killing boars ans got DCd. 13990 in queue. I hate my life.
---
115 minute queue here, my brother is number 1800 and his has said 34 minutes since launch.
---
qq, itll balance out
---
This is actually not true. Even the lower pop servers are having world server issues.
---
I don't get it.  Launch is crucial but 2-3 months doesn't matter.  Sigh.
---
All the low pop realms turned to full.
---
It has always been my class of choice. Made one as my very first character and never looked back. However, if I remember from vanilla, most raids (40 mans) would only have a slot for a single Druid or 2 (this is what I remember from my ex telling me, I personally didn’t raid). I kind of feel like since a Druid can be all of the things it generally means it isn’t the best at anything. But it never bothered me.
---
Yeah I've been in it since launch. Started at 15K. The queue came to a standstill pretty much for me at around 11K.
---
You think you’re in but you’re not
---
Way ahead of you, already cut nipple holes in all my shirts.
---
Launch was an hour and a half ago for me (6 pm) and I work second shift and won’t be home till midnight.
---
Estimated Time: [LIES!](https://imgur.com/a/04wt1Bz)
---
Buy everything.
---
Queue has been 40 minutes for about 2 hours now.
---
I noticed ._.
---
19.7k on Stalagg... so happy my friends and I all switched!!
---
1776 on Thalnos checking in.
---
Literally every server has a queue lol.
---
It will not be as bad as this after today and should get pretty manageable quickly, you'll be fine. Launch days are shitshows for retail and people said that game died 4 years ago.
---
I'm happy I was sitting on the character select screen an hour before as I made it in immediately as the Enter World went red. Unfortunately, I'm on Herod which went down shortly after and since it went back up I've been in queue. Still, better than I expected honestly, I was worried I wouldn't have been able to log on at all. Glad that the community is this strong, no ragrets
---
Been sitting on 20 minutes for....35 minutes. NOICE!
---
Asmongold got to 300k, had 5k new subs in less than 5 minutes, and wow had 1.3m views. Was cray.
---
Why does my position in the queue keep increasing?
---
same......feels bad
---
just punch your numpad and look at the number
---
Welp. There goes my plans to play tonight lol
---
yup
---
Huh? He doesn’t want to play on another server, he already has one in mind
---
Wait till you get in and experience all of the world server is down messages.
---
Not high of an expectation to think that they could handle a launch in 2019 after they’ve handled larger launches in the past
---
the Hype will drop once no one can get in to play it! lol
---
As the prophecy foretold
---
aquatic form
---
WoD was heavily hyped up by Blizzard. They spent a shit tonne of advertisements. Like that one with Grom's Axe impaled on a Taxi in New York.
---
Sub numbers spiked for release. You can see some sub numbers tables since they still released them at the time. 
---
The reason why it was so terrible was a few reasons. The quest to get into the exapc was the same place for both factions. Right outside the Dark portal, so you have the entire server in one zone, trying to find the quest giver underneath the thousands of people was hard because Khadgar would not spawn in. 
---
Then you had to do this instance area at the start which wasn't so bad. 
---
After you did that you had to do the Garrison intro quests. Which required you to kill 8 mobs and plant 5 flags. But only 1 person could plant a flag at any onetime and they had a 20 second respawn timer. There was also only a handful of mob spawns for the required mob. So again you have thousands of people farming over one spot. 
---
Then if you made your Garrison and hope you were one of the few to make theirs first. Garrisons basically created a solo instance for each person of their own Garrison. Thousands of people means thousands of solo instance Garrisons. The instance servers basically shit themselves at this point. If you weren't one of the few people to get through this point early on you were pretty much fucked. 
---
Garrisons were pretty much a no go zone for the first week of the expac. Just travelling through them on a flight path was a big no since you'd get trapped inside unable to leave because of the fucked up servers. The bad thing about this? The entire expac revolved around your expac. You were meant to return to your garrison multiple times during levelling. You either lucked out or got fucked when you had to return. There were a few outposts you could use that would do some of the garrison stuff for you, but it didn't completely replace what you needed to do in them. 
---
Because Garrisons destroyed the instance servers you couldn't do dungeons to level, and doing dungeons at max was tough. 
---
That is assuming you could get past the huge login queues. I had to log off on release day since I had a test at uni the next day. I come home the next day after the test at 12 midday. I didn't get through the queue until 1 am 13 hours later.
---
That moment when your entire server lines up to kill the one boss npc in Elwynn.
---
Didn’t realize the queue starting before the launch... have been in queue for over an hour and a half. 15,000 people and 6 hours to go for Stalagg.
---
I wish I was in the 4 digits on Skeram :(
---
Only train spells you need, you'll have more than enough eventually and the low use of these spells means it's kinda wasted gold.  
---
  Otherwise you'll be poor 24/7.
---
I am in Firemaw queue.
---
Been in 1 hr and 40 mins but ATM it has been stuck on 20 mins for 10 mins with the queue for me at 4800 and not going down by anything other than a couple every minute.....
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status/classic-eu](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/game/status/classic-eu)   shows servers up
---
28756 position 248min waiting time.
---
lol in my day (TBC) I had 9k and felt rich. Thanks, I guess I'll wait a bit.
---
Digital cutting is a real problem
---
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE???
---
Zandalar Tribe was unplayable from all the lags.
---
lol what do you even have to transfer
---
dont worry mine says &lt; min for the last hour
---
We need more servers Blizzard.
---
Supply and demand. The more demand there is for servers and the higher the queue is the more people want to play.
---
You really think a company who has had multiple game launches and several expansion launches doesn't know that there are going to be long queues? 
---
It's all marketing.
---
If the 9/11 terrorists had to wait that long to get into the plane. The towers would still be standing. 
---
it's that bad.
---
Are queues always gonna be there like this on the big servers or is it mostly because it’s launch?
---
673 in queue, Estimated TIme is 15 mins... been 15 mins for the past 2 hours :/
---
Edit: went to 672, woot!
---
friend on stalagg was at 705 position 1 hour ago, now he is at 450
---
hate to say it, but doesn't look like anyone in the thousands positions are getting in before midnight
---
can confirm 1-2 hours for blowme
---
Can you name a few of the servers with no queue that are working perfectly? I'd like to go there.
---
 I really wanted to play Herod but I guess I'm just going to play an emptier realm now..
---
Maybe depends on region maybe? Only 5 EU servers seem to have a queue.
---
My dad said he was able, but I'm still at world server down.
---
And I think that was Patty Mattson (Sylvanas) at 0:52
---
Same here. Guess we were lucky we even got to play at all.
---
Not really lol
---
I think people keep DCing and then if they get back fast enough?
---
Sheeeeeeeeeeet
---
it also says all servers are med - low pop....
---
it has a several hour queue, now.
---
moving at about 100 spots every 30 minutes.
---
True, but walking with Elias feels pretty great too. We also totally have the best Hughes brother ;)
---
I thought you meant that you can fight in there, but they will just attack you once you leave. That would mean there are repercussions.
---
Sat in queue in Herod since 5pm est. I knew what I was getting into. Did other things while I waited. 6pm, only 15 min left. Randomly get d/c’d. Great, hop in queue; 15k people ahead of me. Drops down to 5.5k and timer sits at 15 min for almost 30 minutes. These are the people who *really* want to get in. I’m about 4 min left in queue, and now the storm has knocked out my power and my internet. Guess I won’t be playing today.
---
Yep, probably gonna call it a night and play tomorrow morning vOv
---
Herod queue is completely dead. Been 50th in queue for 45 minutes.
---
You are correct sir. Lol
---
I got in for about an hour till I was dc'd and now im in a queue that's been going for about half an hour or so
---
2532 for me on OCE
---
I didn't say you want raid finder, but if you want literally any improvement then you want something that in it's essence is NOT classic wow, which means you think you do, but you don't. I hope to see you in the upcoming Olympic Games finishing strong in mental gymnastics.
---
PLEASE...
---
I actually love the in que. Why? Nothing more nostalgia than that. They are giving us the worse first. In my humble opinion. Well still waiting....hopefully soon.
---
That's the stupidest thing, just move on... you're probably wasting 100x more time queuing in the game like that like a dork.
---
Just did.
---
I was the same but 29 or 30.
---
And this is why Im in the middle of a divorce and my friend just recently said, "im glad we're hanging out more again."
---
You checked all of them?
---
Got in at launch and had to change some UI stuff, now I'm stuck in the same position. God save us all.
---
What server is this?
---
You and me both..
---
wait at work, the wait time for most servers is like 4+ hours at least.
---
Brand spanking new at 1pm, full by 545. Only 5450 logins til I get my shot to log in. 
---
That’ll take me from 545-8 in q.
---
Can’t wait to see the shit show that awaits lol.
---
There’s a secret path..
---
damn.. 3 hours in queue and I got DC'd.
---
Kromcrush ftw.   15 min queue.
---
That's so fucked up. Streamers shouldn't leverage their power to create a mafia that can have such strong control over individuals like that.
---
It'll be up eventually, and fuck if I'm gonna get back in the queue after finally getting in the character select screen.
---
Just joined. 4480
---
Word spread quickly.
---
See, this doesn't help my skepticism seeing 2,351/21 minutes. What position are you?
---
Nah see estimated time remaining has been 5 minutes for the past 2 hours
---
Hmm maybe but definitely not the case for me, queue is still moving just as slow
---
There's no sound
---
incendius queue is ridic. Its barely moving. I got in at 5:40 EST at 7k ... two hours later im at 3200... wtf
---
what number are you at ? im 6400 with 207min wait time
---
Queue
---
I'll wear all red in town. I guess it's a start
---
here we go, the conspiracy theorist LOL
---
In que for Gehennas on EU server, been waiting for 1h and are 8346 people before me. Watching South Park and drinking coffee while waiting. When the que accually goes Up my spirit drop a bit, but will be worth it. Lets face it, who expected anything else at release day? Will be worth it!
---
Damn, I figured it would be bad
---
That’s a matter of personal opinion with no clear cut answer. 
---
Many of the people here will tell you Classic is better as that’s what we are all here for.
---
you have each other
---
https://imgflip.com/i/38yl1n
---
I am not sure those people are where that comes from but I guess it is possible.  I feel like you judging people how they want to spend their own earned vacation time is "less than stellar".
---
I heard from someone that they are currently playing on Pagle with no problems. Not sure why so many of us are getting the "World Server is Down" message.
---
How is this legal?
---
How many streams are of a login queue?
---
Currently rubbing my nipples against the keyboard. This game is so good. Sorry that some.of you can't play.
---
Beautiful
---
Didn’t you warn her? If so you gotta have a conversation man.  
---
She’s allowed to go to a movie right?
---
&gt; Then logged out to eat dinner
---
ouch man, I'm eating chips at my desk watching an infinity loop of loading screen and "Word Server is Down". I'm too afraid to leave the room and have to do the Queue
---
In the exact same boat as you.  Hoping these queues are cleared out by then.  Good luck to ya!
---
at 7.2k ahead of me. Been at 17mins for an hour, been in Q for two hours
---
/hug
---
could they just do a merge of 2 or more servers at that point?
---
Can confirm
---
Over a million people are trying to log into a handful of servers.  If layering was off I don't think you'd even see the world.
---
Hmmm, I starting to think coming into this two days late might be a true blessing in disguise indeed. 
---
Good luck everyone and stay sane... you'll get in eventually....
---
Maybe?
---
Same for me.....ugh
---
healer
---
10120. I was a bit late too the party haha
---
nailed it pretty much
---
True, but at least in that case the annoyance was, for me, that it happened in a single player game.
---
tRiGgErRed
---
It’s like 12 hours now
---
I’m at work. What are the queue times for OCE?
---
They told people to move servers they literally repeated many times this was going to happen.
---
And they'll forget about the long que launch in that same time.
---
I doubt I'll last more than a few weeks, but I'll pay 15 bucks for a couple weeks nostalgia any day.
---
&gt; yet somehow none of the major streamers have been affected.
---
Half of Method's streamers either can't log in or have been disconnected while playing, lol.  [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/method)
---
 Once you're into the re Once you're into the realm of high-digit queues, if you come home from work and you see that, what that basically means is, you're not playing the game tonight on this server.

---
lol XD
---
I was making really good progress over the first hour or so of the queue...went from 8000+ to 4000+ in about 20-30 minutes, then down into the 2000s, but around 2250 I hit a wall, and for the hour+ since then I've gotten to 2199.
---
I got on right at 6pm, got kicked off 45 minutes later, and now I'm in a 7,000 person queue and hour and a half later that hasn't moved more than 500 in that time.
---
I'm at work at the moment, so probably gonna struggle to get time in tonight.
---
That was my trusty set up for years.
---
Whatever calculation they use for estimated time sure bounces around a lot.
---
Most streamers probably entered realm the second game went live. That's how I got in
---
Love your 50 jerseys this year.
---
Sabres fan :)
---
I have it the other way round.  My wife just abandoned me so I have all the time in the world to sit in a WOW queue....whilst working on getting her back....Oh the joys of being a male....
---
Seriously though. Why couldn't they have made more realms or anticipated this?
---
Me2
---
Been in queue since 2:30 PST, it's almost 5:00 now. Still 1,335 in queue. I have to leave for class in about 40 minutes. I'd skip it, but it's the first day of the semester. Should be a short class, hopefully they'll only keep up for an hour or two to go over the syllabus and safety stuff since it's the first day. 
---
I'm going to have the roommate hit space every 25 minutes so it doesn't kick me. There's a high chance he'll screw it up. Wish me luck, folks.
---
it is an absolute shit show. the brand new server they launched at 1pm has a 10k (probably gonna be 4-5 hour que) and the brand new server they launched after they realized how bad the fucked up there player estimate has a 3k 45 minute que
---
They added 4 more us servers this afternoon? 
---
The crazy thing is this can’t be coming as a surprise...they have all the metrics to track...so why is this so borked?
---
Worst part about a queue isn’t the placement in the queue, it’s the estimated time...  30minutes is actually somewhere between 90 - 120 minutes.
---
Damn sad man 😕 unfortunately unless they add some new servers It won't be ANY better tomorrow...
---
Been sub 1k in queue since 6 pm. 
---
481 with "estimated" 15 minutes.
---
I was 3k at 5:36, now at 882
---
Very exciting times for Sabres fans. Hope you guys go far this year! Expansion bros :)
---
Mine has only watched random episodes here and there and has been bugging me to watch the entire thing with her. I haven't had the heart to tell her about this episode, or My Lunch. These 2 episodes broke me
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/qbMEvt2tl5flC/giphy.gif
---
Started around 5k about 25 minutes before launch. Currently at 1923 and it's saying 66 minutes. Doesn't seem to be moving very quickly.
---
3 is suppose to be closest vanilla graphics
---
I assume you missed step 1 for playing wow classic: kiss your wife’s ass the weeks leading up to it so you get 0 push back. 
---
I watched two kids solo 5 days last week and let her pick where we went for dinner the last two weekends! Now I’ve basically earned a week of higher than normal me time.
---
At 2137 for Skeram. Started at 30 minutes before launch at around 5000.
---
I'm at work sadly, queues are probably going to be even worse when I can finally start to play.
---
Yup same here. Logged in at 2:38 PST and sitting at 2,200.
---
834 now lmao
---
It's about talking to people who are in the que aswell, getting to know the players that will RP/play with you and exchange the guild concepts you have with each other. 
---
It's about being social.
---
I started at 12k about 90 minutes ago. Now it's telling me 5 hours.
---
I wouldn't have thought you could fuck up the re-release of a 15 years old game, but here we are.
---
I've been sitting on 63 minutes since 3:45 Pm, it's almost 7pm now..
---
I trained skinning and bought a skinning knife but it's not letting me skin any mobs that usually should be skinnable (wolves, bats, etc.).  Anyone else having this problem?
---
Grrrreat to meet yeh!
