This is the WAR in WARcraft! This is the only time in the games history you will be able to experience true open war and all out bloodthirsty enemies in the game. Once BGs release this culture completely goes away. Dont take these few short months for granted. Think of it as a rare PvP experience like the McRibb you can only get it for a limited time and its pretty good!
---
I've had a few grey rogues that I ignored cc or sap me. It would be pretty stupid to be penalized to kill them. As far as I am aware very few 60s go out of their way to kill 47&gt; players.
---
I am having a blast with my skirmish squad.

---
Going alone 2 days after the honor system went live ? Mhmmmm, not a good idea bro.
---
Zandalar tribe right? You're the reason I couldn't hand in my quests earlier this week! But you weren't ganking us lowbies so that's nice of you! :D
---
The salt must flow
---
Press mute, now you can watch!
---
Ah, I was so close lol. Thanks!
---
You’re almost making his point, who the fuck cares about 3-5 spell power, it’s fucking molten core
---
But that's exactly why pve servers exist though and I think that's what "pvp on a pvp server" people are getting at.
---
It's not PvP stop calling this shit PvP
---
I been trying to farm my vectus necklace for weeks and I feel like 15 bosses you've got 15 people that primarily drop mail.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
It’s been less than a week. Just relax lol. It’ll slow down. 
---
If you rolled a pvp server now might be the time to figure out why you did that and take part in it. 
---
But either way it’ll practically disappear within a few short months when BGs appear.
---
Do you have any filter running?  Your colors are really popping of the screen and I like the look of it!
---
Zeal is better than Krol, the 10 damage proc is straight dps increase and manages about a 35% uptime across an entire raid and bosses. Which is a straight 3.5 dps increase

You can login to battle.net support and restore all lost items there.
---
oh geez, I remember doing this, I was so upset when they allowed all mounts to be ridden by all characters.
---
DKs are for &lt;48 quest givers/innkeepers. Lacking those is kinda painful for leveling.
---
Uhm what. I rolled a priest back in early 2005 specifically because I had read that Shadow Priests (and shamans, I seem to remember) was OP in pvp.
---
What information can he get? Not much. Don't be dramatic
---
Spam flash heals in a 3 min fight ? Rofl...
---
You will go on in 15 seconds, what are you on about ?

also alot of people were in there pve'ing for quests

This week has made me really happy I rolled a druid. Horde dominated server and I set up a BRD group. Got ganked out of the flight path and then stealthed all the way to the entrance past several raids of uncontested horde in burning steppes, the gate, and the BRD entrance. 
---
Then I waited 40 minutes inside for my non stealthy team mates to corpse run 15 times to the entrance.
---
Any kind of aoe fight just send in some L1 alts and poof the enemy's honour is destroyed.
---
One, you think 30 year olds are the problem and you use the word cringy. Were you even born when vanilla was released? Two, who is asking them to change the game? Some people just don't want to spend their limited game time being griefed by someone who is dual-boxing minecraft.
---
Nope. Just turned my ingame contrast settings to 61 and my gamma setting to.. 1.0, brightness is at 50.
---
Don’t think it works for abandoned hunter pets.
---
Can't and won't. There's dozens of these posts every day and you'd think before you invested any time into a character that takes 100+ hours to level, you'd do your research and then pick your server. That's your own fault and making these posts won't do a damn thing about it.
---
W h o l e s o m e c o n t e n t
---
Is their voice chat not important then?
---
100% accurate
---
This is literal retail mentality if there's an inconvenience bitch until they change. While it may be awkward for some, my group is having a blast with the whole world being a battleground. And yes we're ally.
---
Get your friends that you rolled on pvp for to help you?
---
Otherwise why did you roll on their server?
---
It was radically different early on. There were of course always those that wanted to push early and quickly but they were such a small percentage of the game at the time most people couldn't be bothered to notice. It seemed like some time into Wrath or Cata began the shift to min/maxing guides being everywhere and more typical players moving from casual to try hards.
---
Clearly drunk lol
---
Eh not really, just them laughing and cheering at the end. Worth the watch heh
---
Other than maybe friendly advice and encouragement being a bit of a help. 
---
Instead you choose to act like a cunt towards them when you could just say nothing and ignore the post.
---
You could really make an argument for either one. Go with whatever play style you’ll like more.
---
Swords are really good for hemo builds
---
Daggers are really good for constant CC and backstabs
---
In full BiS, swords are better PvE though.
---
its the opposite everywhere else
---
Every other server is opposite
---
So wait, how much honor can you get this week thats gonna count? No cap or anything to go by atm?
---
It’s not possible for it to be just as bad when ally are so outnumbered on every server
---
Not much difference if you're still getting ganked.
---
Sadly, far too often I'm finding people who act irl as they do online.  Seems to be getting worse and worse as time goes on.
---
U don’t think undead rogues did that too?
---
You’re completely missing the point bud. This isn’t about people being ‘evil’ or whatever the duck you mean by this, this is purely a death by numbers scenario.
---
Sure you have been camped by alliance, but it is quite literally impossible for a faction with 50% less players than the other to dominate. It doesn’t matter how hard ally try or how bad the horde players are, they just have the numbers advantage so they win every time.
---
Waiting for Alliance players to fly in and kill them one by one must be one of the most boring and most unlike-Horde thing to do in classic.
---
The replies to this post make me never want to come back to this sub lol
---
No it isnt, quickly ending the game is much better for honor gains
---
I would be pissed honestly and wouldnt play with person two ever again unless he is a guildie that apologized. But I dont think I would make a lot of noise about it on the server to make him not get invited to groups 
---
I think its polite to ask on your non bis upgrades if they are bis for other classes and that should be expected.
---
Are you actually gatekeeping faction imbalance?
---
Yeah. I'm just worried our server will die, too many idiot horde zerging ss and killing flightmasters and low levels. 
---
Every 1v1 or small group fight I've had has been excellent, it's no fun when it's just a numbers game
---
Thanks !
---
Nice
---
😂😂😂
---
I had been alive for several years by the time vanilla launched and I played it aswell dude. Been playing wow for 13 fucking years lol.
---
Who is asking them to change? These casuals who have no time to play but want to play so they whine about shit actually requiring effort and time to do
---
Are you purposely oblivious or do you really not know? A person who knows what they’re doing can get all of another players information down to their SSN. It’s extremely time consuming and isn’t easy, but it’s very much something that has been done and will be done again.
---
You can *get* to Quel’Thalas

Fuck Bunnings Warehouse

(chuckles)
---
You dumb bitch...
---
I cancelled my sub. I think I have 5 days left and at his rate I won't be renewing. I played a fairly balanced PvP server in Vanilla and I'm playing a balanced server now and it's a totally different game. When I cancelled I made sure to put a custom comment that it was stupid for them to release honor without BGs and with no option other than reroll, which I won't do, I'm just going to flat quit. It's not fun.
---
I usually just hide mine
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah so difficult to go into a dungeon and level.
---
More alliance players overall. More horde players on PvP servers. 
---
If xrealm BG (battle groups) are limited to same server types then yeah, horde on PvP realms and alliance on PvE realms will have longer queue times. I doubt they'll limit battle groups in that way though.
---
This is vanilla, nothing in pve snares 
---
If you want to talk pvp use a different build
---

Big brain guys mind control boomer, spend an hour moving him to big brain leader who then kills boomer
---
Downvoted because you made a good point about people on here with their pity party tantrums lol
---
you can kinda pickwhatever in survival, the key talents are as humanoid slaying, deterrance and imp feign for DM, since this spec wasnt really meant at all for anything but PVE (dm+onyxia kinda since I respec for normal MC) you could easily remove 3 points from Monster Slaying and putting that towards entrapment as well.
---
Same goes for deflection and to some extent clever traps, but Clever traps is pretty good considering Scatter shares diminishing with basically everything hunter has
---
As a player who played vanilla, I can assure that PvP has always been a number count. 
---
This phase lasted in vanilla for 2 months. Up to this point in vanilla it took 5 months, in classic it took 2 1/2 months. So we should be through this in a month if the pace keeps up. Enjoy the experience. Level some alts in friendly zones.
---
If you got the gold then you got the loot.
---
But my point is that they should have a stance on it because it’s not a new technology to allow remote play. I am shocked blizzard doesn’t have an answer for this. So I interpret it as permissible since they don’t.
---
You don't take equipment damage from pvp. I Corpse ran FROM thorium point to BRD due to being camped the whole way and was at 100% when I got there.
---
I’ll make my own mind up where I’m going to play, but thanks for your spergy input
---
During my first run off Sunken Temple I was placed in the fortunate position of getting two upgrades to my tanking weapon as a 51 warrior.  One has .2 better DPS and the other is .20 faster. Based off just that data which would generate rage more quickly?
---
It actually is extremely difficult when you are a hunter.
---
Back in a day nobody knew about it.
---
I’d get bartender 4. Spent like an hour customizing it but so much cleaner
---
I had a lot of fun beating up alliance for an hour in front of Uldaman until we finally decided to actually do the dungeon
---
Stay strong. The roaming death squads will get bored rather quickly and high levels farming honor will have no interest with your honor-less ass, give it a few days and everytime will be back to normal (until you get to lvl 48 and give honor then prepare yourself for death).
---
None of this nonsense. Just give BGs early.
---
It’s basically a custom editor showcase. Not really lore.
---
How did the definition of rouge get put on the rogue discussion thread?
---
Dark Runes can be reserved and go for like 5g each..
---
Best we can do is just advocate more people roll alliance on our server. I think it will get much better in a week or two when the hype wears off, but even then there should be more alliance. 
---
Every ally I've fought has given a good account of themselves, be a shame if people started leaving.
---
This has been my exact experience in SS every time. Just two big groups spamming AoE at eachother so no one ends up actually engaging.
---
I've also found that everyone runs away the second anyone tries to actually engage in an even battle. 100v100 wpvp and all anyone gives a shit about is getting some cheap easy kills instead of actually charging head on and having fun
---
I think the point is they didn't, and the other raid somehow managed to maintain ML on something they lost the tag on.
---
It does very much sound like a bug, but that's not a helpful response really.
---
We didn't have master looter rights, another raid did. 
---
Like I said, it's completely broken.
---
I feel you on this one. Ive been having a blast so far until logged on with honor enabled. hoooly sheet. I play on Firemaw Horde and even though its pretty balanced (horde in favor) alliance are way WAYY more into pvp then horde is currently. Alliance is camping anything, every village everywhere. every flightpath. Doesnt matter if its a low lvl zone 20-30-40 they are there and they will gank you corpse camp you, mc you over cliffs. If its doable they will do it. I had a 60 hunter chase my 45 hunter across the entirety of Feralas to kill me and while he didnt manage to a warrior just came around and helped him. Im seriously worn out doing dungeon runs on my 60( warrior) and I cant level alts anymore. We got MC on farm so I guess I will just login once a week and clear it+ony. And who actually thinks the childlish translation messages cross faction are funny? Big rant after yet another alt+f4 evening.......
---
Sounds like youre on the wrong server. Alliance definitely dominates zandalr tribe
---
That was me and I logged on today, and it was worse than ever. I couldn't get anywhere on my alt, so i log on to my main, and high lvl zones are even worse, and I have bis on pretty much everything. 
---
Hordes literally at every point in game. Even low lvl zones like menethil harbor and auberdine. I literally lost all will to play.
---
No there was no cross realm bgs in vanilla they didnt change pvp schedule yet they shouldn't change queues either
---
I don't think that you're understanding the argument. He is not saying that "the opposing factions shouldn't kill each other because it makes people quit the game." 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In order for a pvp server to exist in a healthy manner there is some necessity for balance and proper pvp etiquette. If griefing and camping happens in an excessive amount by a dominant faction, regardless of whether they are horde or alliance, it WILL lead to people transferring away from the server. That means that there will be one less member of that faction so the remaining members are more likely to get griefed or camped. That effect becomes amplified and can lead to a dead server due to nobody wanting to get constantly camped and that is not good for either the dominant or dominated faction.
---
I'm not sure of a solution for this personally. I myself was part of an alliance gank squad on a horde dominated server and we pulled our weight and then some last night and it was a ton of fun. More horde to kill. I am lucky to have a good community to play with and am patient enough to deal with griefing and camping but can understand how people would get frustrated with their inability to really play a game which they've invested literal days into. 
---
Bottom line - joining a pvp server should not mean that you're signing up to be camped and griefed. Blizzard didn't implement pvp with their intention for people to get camped to the point of wanting to transfer realms. The whole "you deserve what you get, you signed up for a pvp server lul" mindset is utter bullshit and is a large reason that servers die. As I said, Pvp servers can only exist in a healthy manner if there is a balance and etiquette from both parties.
---
LOL hardout. crack up
---
Not with layers
---
Mass of McGowan
---
No, I can do maybe 4-5 dungeons a week, and some solo questing daily. That's generally enough playtime for me.
---
It’ll slowly creep back up due to inflation and extremely high demand.
---
Your idea of adjusting PvP racials was founded on the idea this helped in Vanilla.
---
Now you're just arguing doing it because you *think* that will help.
---
I've seen people *assume* players roll Horde because of PvP racials but I've never actually seen a statistic on it. One done of Redditors doesn't count because we are a very specific demographic segment that doesn't represent overall playerbases.
---
Which leads me to my tl;dr. I doubt boosting alliance racials would do much. I don't believe the racials play *that* much into it. Not enough to cause these 30/70 splits, or worse.
---
If I were to guess, it's because of the overall demographic of WoW Classic players. The vast majority is 30+.   
---
We don't care that much about being fancy-pants, sexy alliance anymore. PvP'ers care more about being gritty and tough. After all players do want to convey an in-game image of ourselves. It's why we call player characters "avatars".
---
I'm not saying racials don't play into it. I'm sure they do, to an extent.
---
Don't know what you think the outcome will be. You expect them to remove gear from them and give it to you? If it's a bug report it.
---
yOu wErE gIvEn pLenTy oF wArNiNg tO gEt leVeL 60 bEfOrE pHaSe 2
---
It's fun if your a mage and can tag 20 people with one spell without getting hit
---
It's completely moronic because horde has much bigger numbers and is much more dominant. I just went through Burning Steppes from flight point to BRM and died 4 times to gank squads while there was no other ally in sight in the whole territory. 
---
The "war in warcraft" thing you on about is maybe true for hordes who delude themselves it's a fair game, but I can't remember one point since classic started that Alliance dominated any territory or farming spots I went to. And I'm supposedly on one of the more balanced servers.
---
You should have to link your server to your reddit account and if you post " Why did you roll on a pvp server if you dont like pvp"  while playing as the dominant faction on a server you just instantly perma banned.
---
I’ve gotten my Warrior to the mid-twenties where there’s a few options for dungeons now, and I’m finding questing quite slow. What’s the most efficient way to level? Solo questing, spamming dungeons, or something else?
---
The horde player rezd and proceeded to keep going without a log off no grief here
---
PvP was fun in Classic because fights were usually organic, nowdays it's just "Hey lets all go to TM so we can get highest Honor/H" It's not about the thrill of the fight anymore, just trying to get rewards.
---
Well I dont expect anyone to know others lists. Just know yours and ask for your non bis upgrades if its ok you roll.
---
I passed on banthok sash a couple of times when it was an upgrade for me because I knew its really good for others.
---
The only things you don’t vendor off mining are the 3 highest level gems and all the stone
---
Lol he's the problem for being corpsed camped right after landing from flight.
---
lol
---
Ok, Pikachu.
---
It wasn't that raid, it was a completely different raid that had ML rights for fuck all. 
---
This is absolutely unacceptable handling of the events and blizzard needs to be forced to own up to these actions. They can't continue to take this hands off approach with classic. 
---
From the very start they wanted classic to fail (or rather assumed it will) and they keep refusing to do anything to actually help with it. Ensuring we have enough GMs to even address issues like this. 
---
Classic is continuing to feel like the worse version of itself at blizzards and players behest.
---
Major rejuv
---
All of classic is split that way great, now lets break it down to a point that would actually matter in this discussion, show the pvp server splits. Because this doesn't filter out pve results.
---
No hat, no play, no fun today.
---
Im on Firemaw Horde and there is no hordes fighting back. Alliance is camping EVERYTHING from BRM to Duke island in Azhara to lvl 20 zones. I mean I get hillsbrad but the fuck are u doing chasing down hordes in a lvl 30 zone with your zerg.
---
Alliance have always been known as kids while horde are adults.
---
Yeah? Why should they get gear if they didn't rightfully earn it?
---
I hope things improve/die down. I just didn't want to lead OP astray. We do need alliance on kromcrush and it's not as bad as some servers but it's still horde dominated.
---
[you](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/304/media/images/52272000/gif/_52272673_crying-baby.gif) and your [brother in law](https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2015/04/crybaby.jpg)
---
Didn't expect a smarter answer tbh, go watch some twitch.
---
Priests can farm mara for gold, prot warriors ideally should have mining or herbalism. Not as insane as other combos for sure (though herbalism is great) but you can still bring in a nice steady income.
---
What's ur lvl mate
---
Lol it has nothing to do with the alliance being more noble, it's about 5000 peoples worth of PVP being focused on 2000 people. 
---
Also I've seen faction queues requested since TBC. People desperately begging blizzard to fix faction balance has been around from launch to when they finally introduced sharding. Maybe longer, I stopped playing around then.
---
Dwarf's are pretty good with Stoneform against Rogues. Gnomes have Escape artist which can be nasty on some classes.
---
Those Horde are turning a PvP realm to PvE. And then, they will complain that they rolled on PvP server to do PvP and there is no PvP anymore... just an another PvE server.
---
Seriously. Majority of these people failing to understand this concept of being out-ratioed by 7:3, 8:2, have horde icons. I logged on after 2 weeks, and it is ridiculous. I couldn't do anything on my main, and don't even mention leveling an alt.
---
&gt;  You think the human condition has changed in the past 15 years? gimme a break
---
You think it hasn't?
---
Only tracks the last 14 days, trying to actually view past data shows incomplete graphs for some servers, completely blank ones for others. As stated the data is incomplete and inaccurate. And that 48:52 split takes all servers where the mod is running into account, there is no filtering out the PVE from PVP which doesn't help at all in a discussion involving the faction splits on PVP servers.
---
Lol you'll have to lend me your crystal ball next time so I can make sure I'm on a balanced server day one
---
All these people bashing the rogues, they’re literally all PvE sword spec against a mage, you guys don’t know how pvp works lmao
---
80% of people who tell you "pvp happened" has an undead rogue avatar on official forums.
---
So Rexxar was "not really lore" either, and Orgrimmar just got plopped down into this land somehow named Durotar? All because "pandas are fucking ridiculous"? Okay.
---
I love watching people still get mad at the existence of pandas in Warcraft more than 15 year after the fact. I just love it.
---
In W3 he is a key character that helps Rexxar.
---
I want to transfer my human priest from Herod to another server because the wait times are too annoying now, what’s a good pvp alliance realm?
---
Thank you, I've had to tell so many rogues to stop using expose armour.
---
Really? What makes you say that?
---
Item level 359
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Real talk. Large scale PvP is unplayable due to lag, while small scale PvP is just not fun.
---
The overwhelming majority of fights just come down to who has more people. When you do find a 1v1, it's usually just a rock/paper/scissors based on what classes you counter and what counters you. 
---
Then when you do find a fair fight, the cavalry charge comes in and just makes sure no fun is happening. Super epic
---
Ok capnneckbeard
---
Oh 100%. It used to be almost perfect 50/50 but that's awhile ago now. Hope we can get back to that
---
I mean it is kind of being whipped. 
---
If you told your wife that you wanted to play in a men's sports league that played on Tuesday nights, what would she say? 
---
I do understand that some people literally cannot commit to a night a week, but 'wife and kids' isn't a reason for that for most 'normal fucking people.' 
---
An actual reason would be something like 'my kids play in a sports league that plays multiple nights a week and I take them and watch the games so I obviously can't commit to any schedule and be there more than half the time.' 
---
'I have a wife and kids' is about as much of an excuse as 'sorry can't raid, I'm single.' Half of the people I raid with on retail are married and/or have kids. They all just play WoW like any other hobby and they block off time for it, like you would a bookclub or going out with friends absent of your spouse.
---
If the HKs from mass PvP are enough to get you into the calculations, this would only require a few minutes of PvP from each player on the server. Wouldn't want to call it work since people had tons of fun PvPing at low levels during Classic's stress test.
---
It would be interesting to see 5 players reaching Rank 14 in the same week. You won't see that with honor caps.
---
My apologies that you haven't had the pleasure of running with a rogue like me who knows what they're doing.
---
have you ever grouped with any of these morons?
---
You fail to understand all of this. Being out-ratioed 8:2 doesn't really have wPVP concept to it.
---
Sounds like a plan. "Hey lets get in a 40 player raid grp so you can escort me to brd" :D
---
Is honor not showing up for anyone else? I have been pvping since thursday and I still can't see my honor when everyone else is able to.
---
It was a meme how good sp was in PvP.  You. Will. Melt. Faces. In. PvP.
---
Yah I’m re rolling on PvE for this reason. I love the server I’m on but I can only play an hour or two a day. It’s not worth the hassle.
---
Of course. That's why I think there should be a faction-based queue times. I didn't really say it was a one-way thing, maybe the OP did.
---
However, if a realm is heavily biased to 7:3 or 8:2, the experience is far from being even remotely enjoyable. 
---
I played in unbalanced servers, but today it was simply unplayable.
---
run dungeons to 60. think i stopped questing after ungoro at 51-52 and just ran dungeons the rest of the way.
---
I am willing to play and support it because I enjoy it.  You just refuse to accept for some reason
---
They aren’t going to suddenly make leveling easier for alliance, or facials better for alliance, or just general quality of life (zeppelins, flight paths) better for the alliance. So to fix the issue would require a ton of work, instead they can fix the symptom pretty cleanly. If you’re affected by a queue, transfer.
---
I have 4381 mana, 27 mp5, and 209 spirit in prebis (not even going to include any raid pieces for this calculation). Over a 3 min fight I will regenerate 180*(27/5) mana from mp5, which comes out to 972 mana. 209 spirit will let you regenerate 881 mana over a 3min fight because of Meditation (the math for this is long; look it up if you care). I have a Lei of Lilies and a major mana potion. Assuming average rolls for consumables I have 8634 mana to work with (base mana + mp5 + spirit regen + lily root + mana potion). Flash head rank 1 (which you should be down-ranking to at this point) costs 125 mana. This means I can cast flash heal 69 times. With a 1.5s cast time you can literally spam flash heal off cool down for 103 seconds. And this assumes that people in your raid need heals at every point in time, you’re not moving at all, and you’re smashing the button as fast as possible.
---
there was cross realm bgs in 1.12. And thats what we playing on.
---
You have absolutely no clue.
---
Lowering server pop is a good thing...
---
My 15 year experience show that this is wrong.
---
solo rogue is a gank squad though lol
---
Dungeon groups are safe dude, go in lfg. Suffer till ur in then can reset via the alt n raid trick
---
Sure, if I can have selective pvp and do my own stuff, I'd be having fun too. I couldn't play on both my main and my alt. FP being camped at Thorium point, menethil harbor being camped, auberdine boat being camped. 
---
I played in unbalanced servers before, but today it was simply unplayable.
---
Yes, it's setting up for a much more prolonged fight, given that casting a max rank FB won't give him enough time to kite at distance. The frostbite proc chance is high enough that it's a good idea.
---
I just died 10 times trying to get into BRD. Its how it goes. I also killed about a dozen alliance at the entrance to Schoolmance earlier in the day. Give a little get a little ya know? If it gets too frustrating log out and watch a movie.
---
Icey
---
That’s literally what’s happening for alliance- like right now. Several of my friends and guildies are just quitting because it is impossible to play. It took me 45 minutes to get to brd on my alt, because 3 rogues literally made a triangle around my corpse so I couldn’t run more than a few feet before dying. This is on a more “balanced” server.
---
...
---
Playerbase has matured a bit. Maturing is probably like becoming carebear in the eyes of those who would use the term.
---
The ol' extreme minority
---
Hordes by far have easier leveling routes and the placements for their major towns, FP are so much more convenient than alliance.
---
I totally get what your saying. I sympathize with you and with all the people saying “it’s a pvp server etc etc”. I’d like to point out to all the people saying  “it’s a pvp server” get used to it, as far as I’m aware, not a single person said “oh btw. You should roll PVE bc in a month blizzard is gonna release honor with no BG’ and therefore your gonna have squads of 40ppl lvl60 plus going around killing players half their level. Making questing, leveling, grinding nearly impossible”. Maybe I missed that thread somewhere?
---
I’m staying on. Just alternating btwn leveling my alt and pvping on my main. I’d much rather be leveling my alt. 
---
Good luck man!
---
Guess whatll happen in AV
---
uhh all ive been doing are 5-10 man squads and i have 750hks
---
Damn, I wish I could find stacks of thick leather for 75s :(
---
this is just how it is right now, if you can't get alliance to raid up and fight them then you'll be farmed. Sounds like the horde on your server are hungry for honor and the alliance don't really care
---
Let me fix that for you, If you're playing on a pvp server, just don't for a few weeks.
---
Biggest server has free transfers, it will calm down tho with less deathsquads rolling around everywhere and less people with kill in their mind the second they see you.
---
that feel when i still havent bought any poisons except instant :P
---
The faster one. You get rage on each swing.
---
Check out Albion Online, lol.
---
When is your sub up? Maybe log in once per day or every few days and feel it out to see if the hype for phase 2 has died down. 
---
Or you can try playing during off hours if that’s possible for you.
---
Best bet is to just know what stat weights you want, and go from there. Like all the information is there you can easily make your own gear list on what you want. Then you can make the decision of is say 8 spell power worth 11 int and 18 stam or whatever for the slot you're looking at. Also you can just say one piece is good in x situation (like say equipping the green only while raiding), and the other piece is good in y situation (like having that high stam piece for when you want to go pvp) and just having both.
---
Alright buddy. Soon enough all the ally are gunna leave. So don't come here in two months whining like a giant pussy on the internet because the game you play is dead because it's your problem not ours.
---
You're just describing what active pvp servers have always been like.
---
Sovereign?
---
Asmongold= Alliance in-game, Undead IRL. Go make your eyebrows pop WotF!
---
The main thing is theres no real gain or system for faction warring. Besides honor its purely griefing purposes. Like the horde doesnt actually gain territory once those players log off.
---
basically you're dealing with virgins who will only ever feel power in a video game
---
&lt;shrug&gt; there's a LOT of them
---
It's a low priority debuff Andy will get pushed off by actually important ones.
---
Legendary stout only 6.1% abv? That's disappointing.
---
Well it would be great if we could have more dps like you.
---
Have you tried running into BRD from Thorium Point in the evenings lately? Usually just a field of alliance spirits throwing themselves to the horde raids
---
K.
---
my RL and his co-tank are husband and wife with two young kids, they wait til they’re asleep to raid too. but we’re all planning to indoctrinate the wee ones to boost the raid team when they’re old enough :)
---
Yes, only if they allow faction changes. And you HAVE to transfer to the less popular faction, no scrubs going from A to H on herod.
---
Everytime someone warned others that this is what would happen on PVP realms, they were shouted down by chuds touting PVP as 'the only true way'. They were warned and still persisted to go PVP.
---
I did PVP realm in vanilla, and you couldn't pay me enough to do it again. PVE/RP is the best way IMO.
---
Are there paid transfers?  I have zero interest in playing on a PvP realm now
---
Too bad alliance is technically the better race for pvp because of Paladins and Gnomes alone.
---
Wasn't there no DR in classic? I remember DR being added in wotlk.
---
black lotus, various herbs, various pots, crusader enchant + greater fire protection pot recipes
---
How good are rogues at killing stuff for gold at lvl60 in good blues? Do you have to eat/bandage often?
---
Then it sounds like you're too casual and should have rolled on a PvE server.
---
“100% grass fed”. 
---
“looks like meats back on the menu”   
---
Hilarious!
---
Also solid, though it might complicate polymorphing.
---
You can
---
but you probably shouldn't
---
Imagine thinking top tier pvp experiences are supposed to be handed to you on a silver platter the day the honor system is released
---
I’d Invite in a heartbeat
---
The game was never initially designed with fairness in mind. It's not a competitive game like CSGO, or Rocket League, or other evenly matched competitive games. It's an MMO. It was created with the intent of community. PvP is a community too. It's looked at like war by the developers and players. All is fair in love and war.
---
I understand and see from your point of view since I enjoy fair PvP games too, but I think you're the one who doesn't understand the point of view of WoW
---
&gt;Not trolling. Just a huge idiot lol.
---
At least you are honest!
---
did you write this before he cried and pissed his pants or after
---
You are being downvoted for being an asshole, not for being right or wrong. 
---
Imagine telling people "fuck the time you spent or your desire to have fun on a video game you paid for, this is pvp bitch suck it up", because that's basically how you sound. Of course you gonna get downvoted
---
Exactly this. 40 man alliance raiding Tauren mill. Soon as we get together a 10 man group to defend they all relocate to Winterspring.
---
If I could time travel, playing games would be the last thing I would want to do haha
---
I mean. I'm saying that pve servers would help your problem, maybe. A lot less people truly enjoy "pvp servers" than they think even if they like "pvp".
---
You still get camped. Friend is having a rough time right now at 57 outside of bgs.
---
PvP servers have never been about having a fair fight. If you want a fair fight switch to a pve server or wait for bgs.
---
I assume the majority of the classic wow player base has actually played the game before at some point, but the way you guys talk about pvp servers make me question it.
---
I've played on a pvp server in retail since 2005 and there's basically no such thing as a fair fight. People avoid any situation where they don't have a numbers advantage, level advantage, health advantage (ganking you while you're fighting mobs or directly after), or gear advantage.
---
If you didn't want to get ganked while leveling you should have rolled on a pve server.
---
i knew everything back then too but then again im not a noob like everyone else.
---
Because there's no way to know if your server is balanced before lvl 60. You got me. 
---
Alliance really do have the biggest brains
---
Have a downvote from an alliance player.
---
Thanks fam
---
I thought it was organic before - after phase 2 started and there are massive manufactured incentives to kill everything that moves... not so organic.
---
Am i missing something? If you want to push raid dps you want a rogue with improved expose armor for the extra 300 armor reduction. Heroic strike and bloodthirst generates more threat than sunder armor so you want dps warriors to help get up 5x sunder as fast as possible. Im talking in a more competitive raid enviroment here and not casual though
---
Take your time and level man... I come from similar boat as you and I have been watching the Southshore battles and it’s going to be fun to participate eventually, but as going to instances or pt then just the small pvp is fun in right way . Don’t give up on pvp man you might not enjoy the latter
---
Ogre* again
---
The chances of getting someone's SSN from their WoW character name is insanely slim.
---
i agree even tho i still rolled alliance, but a bunch of people are new or simply dont think pvp balance is a top priority for the faction they choose and i dont blame them, 2 faction systems blow when one side is clearly favored and you see this in retail with alliance mythic guilds being nonexistant
---
can't blame people that want to rank, it's the game's fault not the player, but I agree BG's would be better for everyone (casuals and people ranking)
---
been looking for this, thanks
---
Especially since they are honorless after landing anyway
---
I got HOJ in my very first BRD run rolling against 4 people, (one of them being our sham healer). Got SGC at my 6th arena run :D
---
As someone who is playing alliance on Firemaw I feel like the exact opposite is the case. Horde seems to be everywhere while alliance is afk in Ironforge. At least people are constantly whining in world chat about alliance not participating in PvP.  So I guess it's an issue on both factions in different parts of the world.
---
Pvp has been out for like 2 days and people are hyped to be PVPing on the weekend. Calm down, things will simmer down in due time.
---
Horde still have slight advantage.
---
theres 10-20 people outside orgimmar every evening on noggenfogger duelling
---
I don’t know what I’m supposed to check out regarding it but if it has a similar mechanic, it’s still a different game and can probably justify this. Runescape allowed you to kill people and take their stuff but only in certain areas. Putting it in wow where you spend hundreds of hours grinding to get gear and there are no safe spots is a recipe for disaster.
---
... Including you apparently? 
---
What exactly are you complaining about? LOL
---
Guess, because you see way to much deathrouges, shadowrouges and so on. People have to learn, that they gave themself this powder name.
---
average playtime for 60 is 7-8 days, so idk what low play time means?
---
Seconded, discipline priest is an incredibly fun leveling experience. You can also heal dungeons up until about 52 as shadow with absolutely no issues (if you choose to swap over to shadow at 40). Wanding is also neither tedious nor boring, in fact learning to wand properly alongside managing spirit tap is an art form that is highy rewarding.
---
sounds real dumb but good luck buddy
---
I'm more interested in why you scribbled out desktop icon names 😂
---
I'll just take this opportunity to say that being require to flair a post is dumb af.
---
You can remove Hunter's Mark by using Vanish.
---
More that comparing wearing a piece of epic gear to a tier one raid over farming a 'bis' piece to wearing a full set of greys makes you look dumb! Glad I clear it up for you!
---
the only ones who come close are the professional idiots on console with some variation of marijuana use in their name who like to "snipe" (go 1-11) in battlefield.
---
ive also seen some high ranking members of the stoner legion flip a transport chopper without even taking off. the best of the best.
---
They won’t even let us see pop data so we can balance ourselves.

Cold blood + ambush / blind / stealth / prep

---
Lol horde problems on PvE servers, how exciting. Try playing alliance on PvP.
---
high intelligence comment
---
Two hours a day and got hand of rag? I want whatever hes smoking.
---
I've been 60 for about a month now and I'm nearly fully epic'd out but I'm considering canceling until BG's, too. Literally the only reason I'm not canceling is because I don't want to lose my raid spot for when phase 3 hits but I'm not happy about that.
---
Is it? Warlocks is significantly worse than t1.
---
Would be great if they allowed transfers
---
3-4 hours a day
---
Instead of linking to an active stream you need to link to a clip or atleast a part of a vod.  
---
Right now when I clicked your link you were just jumping around outside the gate of orgrimmar with a bunch of other horde just chilling...
---
I stopped reading at "alliance on herod".
---
The topic is about a non-herod server that gets horde population dominating the alliance one. Just stay on the current context. This server will die because Horde players do not understand how economy of population works and then they will complain no more able to do WPvP because there is no Alliance left.
---
Me too
---
Bro
---
He knows it's inefficient. It just looks and feels cooler. It's that simple.
---
Calm ur titties
---
Sulfuras is probably the most balanced server most ally log in at night tho.
---
This gear set looks best on undead imo.
---
as a mage i would say spellcleave dungeons
---
Can someone get this guy a diaper and some Gerber's? Whine about it in guild chat, this isn't the place
---
Griefing is a practice where the griefer derives joy from antagonizing other players.
---
I don't kill the 57 farming satyrs because it brings me joy. I do it because it's the way through the gates designed by Blizzard.
---
Nope
---
Exactly, shadowpriests were the most feared spec back then. I'll never forgot the name of the HWL SP on my server, he had people shitting their pants when he joined the BG.
---
/salute Jakerprest of AQ
---
gonna make a guide for the entire specc soon, just caught up in honorgrind atm\^\^
---
vanilla isn't designed for that kind of person? ever considered that?
---
you dont get any of their attacks actually
---
even on a 50/50 perfectly balanced server you're gonna get killed a bunch. world pvp is just stupid.
---
&gt;As a horde player on skeram, the population is definitely not that slanted.
---
???
---
How is this upvoted, it is blatantly untrue. Horde VASTLY outnumber alliance, at an absolutely minimum of 3.5/1. Go check the census data, and the warcraft logs data.
---
Hyperbole is a technique used to illustrate a point. The subtext is “if you are going to wear something knowingly worse than an option you already have, where do you draw the line?”.
---
No idea why you felt the need to post without adding any value, just to shit on people.
---
Lol, let's get LinkedIn for WoW
---
Remindme! 2 months
---
If you got lvl 35 from start to now - chill abit until Battlegrounds are introduced and all those people (or nearly) are gone. I can tell you did not want to "play" alot so the downtime doesn't matter at the end.
---
Lmao so because someone isn't a neckbeard in their mom's basement fuck them?
---
Next dream about having millions of dollars and a 10 inch shlong.

---
Not directly related to your question but you say you have "most" of your points in shadow. 
---
Since you're lvl 40, you may want to consider respeccing to full shadow to get the shadow form, not only will it help you leveling, but the +25% shadow damage and incoming damage reduction will help a lot. 
---
Bubble, dot, mind blast, mind flay, fear when they get too close should do the trick as deep shadow is pretty good in 1v1.
---
Paladins, simple as that
---
you're changing your argument
---
There is a huge problem with faction balances and wpvp at the moment that you're blatantly ignoring.... and I'd personally like to beat it into your fucking thick shill.
---
You'd run from this hilarious experience?
---
Classic is hard to play 😂😂😂👍🏽
---
World defence
---
Love blizzard :) got it back. And all items plus tjat day i got ironfoe aswell :)
---
I don’t believe that you can play for, say a min of 10-15 hours a week and not be letting something else in your life (that should be more important) slide a bit.  Or a lot.  That goes for basically everyone, maybe not kids, but exponentially more for moms and dad.  I do raid from time to time in various games, but I always end up taking a break because I find it’s taking a toll on something else in my life more important than video games.
---
Form up a raid, so you are all gathered in one spot for the 4 horde raids to farm. That's what going into a raid does for alliance on the servers. Just puts you all in one place to chum the waters. Oh and make sure you never spirit res, there are horde at every possible GY.
---
You say no faction queues because it’s unfair, but when you describe why it’s unfair, you just describe like, the exact situation many alliance have across a number of servers right now. Like I’m tempted to believe this is just really committed horde satire.
---
whoever told you there are more alliance must be the biggest troll in the town
---
Blizzard have never done either of those things in the past, and had not said anything that hinted that they would before launch. So expecting something that a private server did, even if it would be effective, was just wishful thinking. Expecting Blizz to do something different just because it would be better than what they've always done is a tried and true way of ensuring your own disappointment.
---
If there was a macro to unequip a weapon it would be easy, but I haven't found one just yet. However, I have found a workaround for myself for my level 19 twink, although its a very terrible workaround. 
---
So in essence, I start with Shadowfang in my MH and Assassin's blade in my OH. In order to get Assassin's blade into my MH and Shadowfang into my bags I have 
---
#showtooltip Ambush
---
/equipslot 16 Assassin's Blade
---
/cast Ambush 
---
as my macro. Then I have 
---
#showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
/equip Shadowfang
---
/equip Assassin's Blade
---
/cast Sinister Strike 
---
as the second macro that I use. Unfortunately because I couldn't find a way to unequip an item, I would need to have a second copy of assassins blade in my inventory for the first ambush macro to work, as it cant equip assassins blade as i already have the item equipped. Stupid workaround, and as soon as I find a way to unequip a weapon and then re equip it into a different slot with a single button press i'll use that instead of eventually giving in and getting a second assassins blade just to ambush people in BG's eventually
---
I’ve been going into south shore and just taking people out lol
---
I've given away hundreds of gold...  It has as much or as little value as you assign it
---
If you have a wife and kids and choose to play on a pvp server, you have no one to blame but yourself. I say this as a 35 year old with a more than full time job and girlfriend. I choose pve because I actually want to play the game when I have a couple hours.
---
I also have a solution:
---
Git gud
---
Nope.
---
Are there not enough higher lvls to make A raid group to help protect the smaller questing groups?
---
Just curious because I've also thrown around a couple 100's, did you ever get anything back? 
---
On private I often got people sending gold back a couple hours/days later or when they dinged 60 or just a TY mail but so far nothing. :(
---
Like 50% don't even say anything at all, not even when you give them 10g when they ask for 1g for skills or bags.
---
Generally people seem more friendly and are good tippers for professions but I find that detail just peculiar compared to private servers.
---
also elemental mastery is broken and gives 2x crits if you batch spells together eg: chain + earth
---
This gave me a dumb idea that would never happen but I like it anyway: what if all alliance just agree to quite for like a week in protest and fuck up horde rankings lol.
---
Hey! Very fun server indeed :)
---
So every ally player should have rolled on pve and pvp realms should have been 100% horde, and people who didn't do their homeworks should locked into unplayable servers. 300 iq. Just because blizzard didn't do something in the past doesn't mean they shouldn't now.
---
Change what? 100% you do not know how the world works if you think its that easy to steal someones identity.
---
Alliance are winning so many world bosses...i guess faction imbalance isn't that problematic outside USA most popular servers
---
Did someone say....
---
I use z-perl unit frames.
---
They are really bot fancy but I used them forever and works for me.
---
Which doesn't really make a ton of sense. Whatever the mass majority is attempting will almost by default not work inside the honor system because it's a weekly race to the top. And you're not getting to the top by doing the exact same thing as everybody else...
---
shadow priests melt faces in pvp
---
wasn't a meme for nothing
---
I think 3-5 man death balls are probably the best. Solo you're just going to lose too many fights, but in a group you should win every fight that isn't against a raid group, while still getting a significant portion of the honor earned.
---
This deserves more attention
---
bye
---
If that's something people care about and why you think I picked Horde or a majority of people did then I feel sorry for you.
---
I just got done with a 6 day binge out in winterspring for a blue dragon sinew.
---
I farmed it 6-8 hours a day for 6 days strait.   Im guessing i got somewhere near 1000 kills,  but probably more.
---
in all fairness, the extra steps are reagents that are costing more by the day, fadeleaf is gouged and if you wana farm lockboxes, enjoy your jog through the BRD meat grinder
---
\&gt;ganking scum
---
seems like pve is more your forte
---
Two raids rush the final boss to max out their rep and never do AV again?
---
Yeah I’m completely aware. Have you not read of the numerous others who have done this before? The people who do things like this aren’t sane. But it happens. They always get caught, but that doesn’t matter to them. What matters is someone pissed off the wrong person at the wrong time.
---
do dungeons and wait for the hype to blow over
---
It depends on what kind of PvP you're referring to.  Melee is pretty useless in large scale PvP.
---
[deleted]
---
Let’s do some maths!
---
Arcanite Transmute is 5 gold every 2 days. Which works out to be 2.5g per day. 
---
Undead to water is 10-15g (let’s average 12.5g every day). 
---
Every day you use the Transmute of Undead to Water you essentially make 10 gold more than Arcanite. 
---
With a price of 1000g, it would take 100 transmutes to be worth it. 
---
100 transmutes can be completed in 100 days, but often people will miss days, and the transmute gets pushed back further each day forcing you to either stay up super late, or skip days. 
---
If you plan on playing regularly all the way to Naxx, then it’s definitely worth it. But if you’re a casual player, who can’t play every day, eventually you will break even and start profiting, but it’s probably not worth the initial investment by then.
---
Plays the overpopulated faction  
---
Complains about being ganked  
---
Horde are cowardly scum
---
i play a human paladin, nice try
---
8kills HoJ. 70+ kills Rend MH. Prett good
---
12 weeks of 13k honor, do you even know what you’re talking about?? 
---
13k Honor is very little, regardless this is not how the honor system works. It all depends on how much honor your fellow factionmates collect. The player with the most honor receives first place for the week and gains a set amount of rank points,  setting the bar for everyone else.
---
I’m guessing the guy you’re replying to assumed you meant the highest rank of Flash Heal, not the lowest. Fair assumption as it sounded like you were dismissing the need to down rank at all.
---
Okay, so your going to ban every player that’s on a server discord?
---
No fuck that.Most people are enjoying world pvp.No bgs this year , Activision needs to stop rushing
---
MLG
---
Honestly I think world PvP is only fun on servers with near equal populations.
---
I will always love this dance because it reminds us of a great man.
---
Oh my god! I had completely forgot about that. I actually took like a week off from work and went to the midnight release for Wrath. The hype for that expansion was super real and it came at a perfect intersection in my life of minimum wage bs job and being single.
---
Hey! That’s only 20 minutes away, now I can realize my dream of finally getting Thunderfury.
---
the belt is really good
---
Lmao there were loot bugs back in the day, too. You’re just being a bitter neckbeard about it.
---
Shouts out 317
---
lmao alliance mad they're being forced to rp servers
---
&gt; auto detects rogues?
---
Not at all it just says there is a rogue in a 100 yard radius that has done an action in hour combat log. I don’t need it to know that there is one, there are rogue gank squad in every choke/pathway and road currently.
---
And you can still hide, it’s not because you know there is someone that you know where this someone is, rogue or not. I have this addon the only thing at which it’s useful is to target the guy you want in a brawl and maybe try do dodge the gank squads.
---
Sounds like PVP happened on a PVP server
---
Sounds like you want to play a Dwarf and will easily adjust to your faction change or server transfer.
---
Depends on the version of AV. It was patched, and changed quite a bit. I think you are thinking of AV as it stood in tbc/world/cata.
---
Racial stats... really? I think it's a blatant excuse. It's obvious to me that "most hardcore PvP players" roll Horde because they think this narrative is true. And because they think this narrative is true just make it even worse.
---
I will not call them "the most hardcore PvP players" who need to be in a party of 5 to kill (and then corpse camping him) a single alliance player minding his business while questing.
---
Back in 2004-05, the narrative was the opposite since Alliance over populated all PvP servers.
---
Truth is, none of "the most hardcore PvP players" wants to do solo PvP. Or, when they do it, it's always one of those classes: Rogue, Mage, Warlock or Priest (Shadow). Never you will see those "most hardcore PvP players" chooses a Holy Priest, Holy Paladin or a Protection Warrior.
---
I'm confused. Why didnt he just ask for 140 of each.
---
Why would the entire raid waste their time to protect “small questing groups”? Of course I am gonna help if I see someone fight but I am not a babysitter to stand on the same position protecting some random guys just because they don’t want to level in dungeons for whatever reason.
---
you're the exact kind of moron who feels the need to differentiate between devs and management when people say things like "the devs got this thing wrong", no one gives a shit and no one is ever blaming codemonkey#4 kiddo
---
Get an addon called Booty Bay Gazette. It will show the AH trends on your realm as well as all realms in your region.
---
You don’t know how the online world and internet works if you seriously don’t think things like that happen and like I said, it’s not easy, it’s quite hard. 100% you’re oblivious in your little bubble.
---
Agreed server performance is shit. But blizzard is NOT to blame when it comes to faction imbalance. That's completely up the community. Look at the 3 big EU servers; gehennas, golemagg and shazzrah. They're all fairly even because big guilds planned ahead.
---
Many do but most don’t?? Yeah, that’s why blizz had to provide multiple new pvp realms for eu. Us is the minority.
---
I hit 60 a couple weeks ago and just kind of stopped playing. This legitimately reinvigorated my interest in playing. Grinding BiS tomorrow morning
---
You’re just saying the same thing about the other side. So I guess the alliance players should be punished... selfish person right here. Hope you get carpal tunnel.
---
This was supposed to be a bait to get some viewers
---
For a lot of people it was "My friends rolled on one, and I like playing with my friends"
---
just say some bs like the internet or your computer glitched out
---
I agree. Its such a early level people are still figuring out whats right and wrong too. Lots of reasons. Let them know why.
---
let me guess, UD rogue on a horde dominated server?
---
Yeah AV will be extra boring with nerf changes
---
Which is why you assign marks to each mage and don't have that problem.
---
Plus it's pretty much unplayable. The servers just cant handle it.
---
Your anger is negatively impacting your reading comprehension. Saying that there was no reason to expect Blizzard would do something doesn't mean I think that they shouldn't. I think faction based server queues and having lower(and faction based) caps during the name reservation stage would have helped to ensure more balanced servers. However I don't think there was any reason to expect any of that.
---
Also, nobody is locked in to anything and pretending otherwise doesn't help your argument. You could always re-roll, as unappealing as that is. Pretending you absolutely have to play on the server you picked at launch because of the time invested there is literally just the sunk cost fallacy. If you are not having fun on your current server you are better off rolling somewhere else. It takes a lot more effort than simply complaining that Blizzard can fix it, but you aren't "locked" anywhere.
---
because in modern WoW duels are not fair nor skill based. Too much RNG and certain classes are way to overpowered in 1v1's such as Mage and Warlock
---
I feel like at this point it's almost the formal way to start any sentence in this sub, regardless whether or not it's true.
---
I was overhyped, bought a month to try for the first time WOW, logged in, tried a fireball, saw yards, saw I can't change to metric system, uninstalled the game.
---
No seriously, does this game really not have a metric system?
---
This is what I did. It made it easier for me to get used to using the new mouse. I had 3 bars set up that matched the mouse layout, and used shift/ctrl to switch between them.
---
If you want to say you have no counter arguments just say so bud.
---
“Only on PvP realms” ... yeah considering that 80% servers are PvP and 20% PvE - I don’t know what’s wrong with your maths that makes you think there are more alliance overall. Besides, on PvE server the faction imbalance doesn’t matter at all. So basically everywhere where faction ratio is important (i.e. PvP servers) the horde is dominating.
---
Come to pve, we have cookies.
---
Nah I don't think that's why you picked horde or why majority of people picked horde. But it is something a good amount of people care about and why they picked horde.
---
You CAN use a hunters bow but only auto shoot. That was the only thing outside of auto attack melee I’ve seen from my personal experiences mind controlling people.
---
Sounds like your "bar" is actually a massage parlor
---
&gt;without sacrificing some other elements of the game.
---
Hey! That’s my server lol
---
There's loads to invest your gold in, primarily crafting materials that will appreciate in value.
---
A wild warlizard appears!
---
By posting the same whiny threads on reddit obviously
---
By hordeI assume  you mean $majority\_faction, and by alliance you mean $minority\_faction.
---
HAHA, oh man
---
Why? You guys are the ones raging so much you want to punish Horde. Imagine being smug over a horrible idea that will never be implemented. Have fun being farmed.
---
We already played the game, does not include me i guess.
---
Hardly...
---
Raging, tbh.
---
He didn't quest, your point is moot.
---
Sorry u late
---
No matter what I do, I always end up writing a huge wall of text, lol. I'm 26, no children. 
---
Hey, I'm pretty sure I'm right about the parents of the past, but you are the future, a part of the internet genetation. You and others like you may very well be parents that all the children always wanted - open minded, intelligent, self aware individuals not afraid to ask questions. 
---
If you want any parenting advice from someone who used to hate his family (well I don't like them now, I just feel a lot of pity for them), please do send me a message. I'd love it if you didn't make the same stupid mistakes my parents made :D 
---
But one thing, I must say. Please always respect your kids and see them as human beings. Be aware that they are aware - often they see, hear, know and understand soooo much more than anyone realizes, and they won't always let you know. Always ask yourself - what if you were in their shoes?
---
I wish you the best of luck, and your wife and kids too!
---
just breath man it's okay
---
This is a solved game - what do you expect people to do?
---
Well, it’s a coffee stout. Those are usually a little lower ABV, at least in my experience
---
They don't have to get busy  just finished.
---
Thank you for making a great point to add to the discussion on why its a horrible idea that will never happen.
---
Killing someone 20lvs bellow you doesn’t make you good in the game either.
---
Lol look at his comment history. He is so salty towards alliance its crazy. I wonder what happened that made him like this.
---
Top 5 out of 8 classes? Wow thanks for the insight
---
so you want alliance players to get farmed and then quit? what do you think will happen to the game then?
---
Please don't forget the horrendous queue times for unbalanced servers. Those 4:1 players better enjoy 1h+ bg queues. Kek.
---
This is the smallest micro penis comment i have ever seen.  
---
Did you ever consider blizzard is responsible? These servers have 10x the population of vanilla servers. The faction balance is alot more extreme and a greater population lets move obscure areas feel the affect of wpvp when it otherwise would have been untouched.  
---
  
---
Blizzard could have and still could enforce a faction balance on their servers. It would improve the experience on both sides and be more in line with the vanilla experience.   
---
Instead they arent doing shit while they cash in on that nostalgia train. They will nerf pally bugs and diremaul farms thought np. Even make some new ads and login banners about PVP and world bosses. While on the other hand continuing to wipe their ass with pvp.    
---
Blizzard is a company with a long public history of dropping the ball or straight up ignoring their customers especially when it comes to pvp.    
---
In one comment you manage to absolve them of any responsibly and blame a paying customer?? You are delusional.  
---
Please, if you see someone dressed to slutty, dont rape them.
---
I think that's the criticsm. I don't know what you think you're doing here???
---
My thoughts exactly, I was sick of getting ganked by no lifes already, and that was before phase 2 dropped. I havent been on Herod since, why would I want to? Ive been leveling a rogue on bloodsail recently because I heard RP realms were more alive and friendly, and its PvE so.
---
HKs doesnt mean anything.
---
This isn't 100-0 at all. If this rogue wasn't afk he could easily have vanished or blinded after being ambushed (either time).   
---
With all your cd's like this it is very easy to get a proper 100-0 on an enemy rogue if you get the opener, so using ambush twice is just hoping the enemy is bad. In this case it worked out yes.
---
A yard and a meter are almost the same length
---
I’m alliance on benediction and maybe we are in different zones but it feels horde dominant to me
---
Yes bro, but only when you got a shammy by your side
---
Of course. Vanilla is a game of consumables at the top level.
---
Do lbrs asap. The experience is much much better, regretted all my BRD runs when I went there lol
---
I'd be open for a solution that literally isn't "daddy Blizzard please punish the big bwad Hordies for me!" It's not my fault you have bad tastes.
---
I wonder why. I flew to WPL twice on my 52 pally. Both times, I didnt make it past the first mob you come to before a horde squad killed me. Literally impossible to quest right now. Our only options are group PvP or instance grinding. Horde won't let us do anything else.
---
people like you are the funnest to gank
---
I’m curious if there is an actual difference in behavior between horde and alliance.
---
I have always played horde and the alliance has always had plenty of asshole griefers
---
mine showed up today... Also I had mysteriously woke up to a DK that I didn't have before, but then when Honor showed up the DK disappeared... so IDK wtf is going on anymore.
---
Yeah except people did it on private servers too and PS had all sorts of reverted changes to make it a lot more like the old version. Pretty much the only thing they couldn't add back was two major features of terrain that were removed early on in like 1.4 or 1.5.
---
People have changed a lot in the space of 15 years.
---
Or you are worth honour multiple deaths?
---
What does honor give ? Like the points. I’m new to wow
---
lmao more pathetic allies cries , git gut noobs
---
Yup.
---
Good on you for realizing 2c is worth it to stick it to those undercutting bastards. 
---
To be honest, I much prefer the 1c undercut than the dude who walks in with 40% undercuts and HIGH VOLUME
---
Its in the lore though.
---
Not broken per se, that interaction is one of the reasons batching was argued for. Taking that away has a notable impact on Ele shaman pvp capability.
---
It would be difficult to properly mimic most of those weird impacts of removing batching.
---
I love uneven fights, whether it's against me or in favor of me. But, most people don't. Wow's pvp system seems pretty shit, and only exists to drive away casuals. Rip
---
You're tired of alliance complaining? I'm tired of horde saying suck it up pussy. Horde don't have to deal with the shit show of heavily unbalanced servers NOT in their favor. These roaming death squares are literally making the game unplayable for most ally. I'll PvP anyone any fucking day. I enjoy it. Getting rolled over by raid groups constantly looking for you or having to do 6 corpse runs to get into a dungeon or being corpse camped by multiple members is just fucking bullshit. It's not PvP. But keep believing whatever you want. Eventually there will be no more PvP as the alliance have had enough and quit. Then you little hordies can go circle jerk over that time 10 of you camped a lvl 50 for an hour. Ah great times I'm sure.
---
Bingo.
---
What’s wrong with saying that this sort of pvp isn’t fun? Not sure why I have to conform to your opinion. I’m a geared 60 and don’t struggle with the pvp it’s just that I’m not finding it to be very fun. It also doesn’t do the game justice as it is an amazing game.
---
As a warlock I can say that we are no longer summoning for BRD haha, it's a warzone outside. Mages do offer a unique  benefit of water though.
---
Have you tried pve servers? We still have 80vs80 wpvp battles, but at aleast we can quest without getting griefed
---
I'm so glad people like you don't get to make decisions.
---
Lol horde
---
You should have a wand, but a wand doesn't replace a staff.  
---
You can have a staff or a one hand plus offhand
---
Level 52 here and definitely going to cancel if they don't offer transfer. If I had any idea PvP server would be this cancerous, I never woulda bothered.
---
Right now yes I want you to get farmed and quit since you're suggested "solution" to this is to make me quit. Why should I feel remotely bad about making you want to quit when you want to make me quit?
---
Benediction has a horde favoring split of 60/40. Pretty balanced compared to some of the servers, but its still noticeable.
---
Great advise, Ty. Do you have a Hemo Sword build you could recommend real quick?
---
Never said otherwise, OP never even specified what it is they focus on anyway
---
Alliance are quitting at record pace right now. I think one side quitting and losing subs is more important than making horde wait in a longer queue. Their side has too many players. Not alliance. Not our problem.
---
If it makes you feel any better I'm level 51 and dealing with the same issue. You're not alone.
---
I really appreciate that apostrophe.  I was sure that you were dodging all dictated of proper literation solely to vex me...  I feel much better now.
---
We can be friends again.
---
Get questie and just reroll lvl 17 is just a few hours.
---
Not sure on which realms are good, but you can only transfer when blizzard allows free transfer to realms they give the options of, there are no paid character transfers.
---
Good let the salt flow through you and please quit the game. Unless you have a different solution that isn't to make me want to quit then I'm happy with making you rage quit. 
---
How am I even supposed to feel bad for you when you want to punish me for your poor choices and tastes?
---
Jesus Christ, why are people like you on a PVP server? Someone is always going to lose in PvP, that's the point.
---
Ten 60s jumping me wherever I land sure is fun at 49! You lot basically forced everyone into dungeons now and soon you will cry that there are no people from the opposite faction to world pvp with lmao.
---
You will miss open world PvP when you get shit stomped against premades in BGs, you people are so naive and ignorant. 
---
You'll get farmed in 6 minute WSG games and 75% of your team will be AFK.
---
when did i ever suggest this particular solution or even condone it? i never did. i was just curious about your thought process lol
---
It’s weird, do they know they’re literally going to have zero alliance in a few months if they keep this up?  Seems weird to actively cause your server to die.
---
Yes it does! Those noobs should know better then to try and quest in a zone meant for their level!
---
So you think it’s balanced and not a problem? 40 ppl raid is always gonna lose against 55 ppl, same for 28 ppl against 20, it’s actually a huge difference close to 1.5 vs 1. Servers have different ratio, some are better than ours, some are worse but we are all united by the same problem - horde dominance - are you implying it’s because there is a problem with alliance literally everywhere? Of course not, numbers matter more than you think.
---
Dont let idiots get to you. I hope you can find joy in playing wow in the future.
---
I agree that shitty behavior was similarly prevalent back in 'the day', but I disagree that social media hasn't served to make things worse, in a way. It's give and take. 
---
The organization capabilities of modern social media, combined with 15yrs worth of knowledge and experience, has enabled people to take things to extremes both good and bad. 
---
In this, it's as you said: people were not nicer back then and the world wasn't a better place lol it's just that fewer people were as organized, people weren't so connected on this large of a scale, and the game had yet to be vivisected and splayed out for everyone to examine.
---
Definitely DR in classic. It was added to CC skills I'm an early patch cause of griefing with sheep, fear, etc.
---
I’m honestly not sure if you’re trolling. 
---
It’s a game, and the unit is totally arbitrary.  They could have measured distances in gnomes, or even just said “range 30” and it’d make absolutely no difference.
---
750 HKs worth 5 honor each lmao
---
Your primary example of Alliance players "not wanting to pvp" takes place in a Horde zone... Yes, I'm sure they'd be thrilled to pvp in a zone for which they have no nearby flight path, and in which they cannot engage any fights unless they're attacked first (usually by someone that vastly outlevels them). 
---
If you want engaging pvp from the opposite faction, stick to a contested zone where both sides have flight paths and incentives for fighting.
---
&gt; Endlessly camped for hours
---
&gt; not exactly high traffic area
---
Pick one.  Either they will be camped constantly or they won't if they go to lower population areas.
---
You're just a troll
---
Nothing built in, but this could be accomplished with an addon should someone feel inclined.
---
battlegrounds should release earlier than BWL anyway, I hope they will do the same as phase 2.
---
&gt; No-one plays on a PVP server to get gangbanged by the opposing faction.
---
Right. Well, I don't and you don't either, can't speak for everyone. It's not like I'm logging in and hoping to get camped over and over. But I think the possibility of that happening is part of the fun. Makes the world dangerous. There are plenty of options to not get in that kind of situation, you can choose a server with a different balance, a different type of server, etc. If someone finds fun in 5v1 camping noobs, it's not my place to tell them they can't have fun. Why is my way of playing the game the right one and theirs the wrong one?
---
It was sarcastic, and I know it doesn't change anything. 
---
Still, it would have been nice to have a simple option to convert it.
---
Then switch factions or servers. Why don't you want to solve this yourself if you think getting punished is a good idea?
---
Ive seen this streamer twice. The first time was a post in this subreddit about him ninjaing an item.
---
 The next one i see is this. Idc if people hate him or not but i can look at it from a non biased standpoint and point out why, people who arent fan boys or follow this petty attention seeking stremer shit, instantly shit on the dude besides the fact this wasnt a thread designed to shit on him.
---
My point was, no one read the thread they just saw he ninjad a helm and labled him a twat. 
---
Despite what you want to think i didnt shit on him, i just pointed to an answer to the question in the comment i was replying too.
---
In a long fight they should be equal, since rage generation just depends on damage dealt.
---
But for a tanking weapon a faster weapon is nice. You get smoother rage generation and smoother threat on enemies with auto attacks.  
---
Getting a miss or two in a row with a slow one-hander can leave you with basically no rage generation for 6-9 seconds.
---
I do like when someone ganking me goes wrong and I kill them.
---
a bit triggered hey little fella?
---
I wish more people were willing to admit that pve servers are a completely different game with zero risk/reward loop.
---
Yea yea, I mean even if the tauren didn't play along like this guy did.
---
WPvP was great. It was small scale, impactful and fun.
---
This? This is the farting of over-bloated servers, stinking of Blizzards incompetence.
---
Lol I love your wall of text acting very knowledgeable but you apparently don't know we have crossrealm bgs when they come out.
---
it wasn't sorry, took me a while to stream, 1st time doing it. some ODB config. When i was strying to start it i was dead every minute. Would just save and upload a link to a woopas next time.
---
Then maybe spend less time on vidya games lol
---
Horde absolutely has more toxic people. Toxic edgy people gravitate like flies to Undead
---
Can't really mark a MC'ed target in time, especially on Skeram. You need to be casting that Polymorph immediately, or the MC'ed rogue backstabs someone for 6k damage.
---
max you'll get for 8 hours is level 10
---
I've said I'm open to ideas, I'm just shitting on that horrible one that has been posted a dozen times. I don't have a solution and the solution certainly isn't faction specific queues. That's such a horrible idea. I have still yet to get any arguments on why it'd be good and just a bunch of insults and people pretending I'm mad.
---
I agree 100% now get over and get good I'm only level 52 And I have no worries man just enjoy it
---
How are you supposed to get there in one or two hops if they are waiting for you at flight path and there's 80 more of them waiting between TO,  BRM and then the run to BRD? Even the ramp up the lava was camped by around 10 hordes.
---
&gt; When I cancelled I made sure to put a custom comment that it was stupid for them to release honor without BGs and with no option other than reroll,
---
You had the option of looking at the release schedule and knowing this would happen lol
---
Switch to an alt since you aren't 60
---
Or farm brd
---
Nope, glad you never tried to throw an argument in any where though.
---
It sucks, MC is cleave heavy so not having blade flurry will hurt you massively. Also the 30% crit as a benchmark is what I would take unbuffed, not fully buffed. This means fully buffed you will be closer to 40-45%
---
&gt;I dont regret rolling on a PvP server
---
I do. Hope they offer transfers to PvE. PvP is just stupid.
---
I agree this is a smart move.   This also incentivises ppl to play the smaller faction
---
Comp sci major here, I can confirm you’re delusional.
---
 It's a bug submit a bug report. Sucks to miss out on loot no matter who ya are.
---
An acceptable fix would be to make 60s only get honor from other 60s, everything under that is a dishonorable kill. It would still encourage world pvp while sparing the poor lowbies. (now then of course some edgelords wouldn't care either way but then they can say goodbye to ranking)
---
Naturally, actiblizz won't touch it. Look at their guard fix with increased range, the guards are too weak and basically any 60 can delete them everywhere, so most cities are not safe regardless.
---
Reroll atiesh horde.
---
That's the narrative: horde has the best racial abilities than alliance.
---
What's about Dwarf? They have Stoneskin, Boost of Stamina, Boost with guns and their priests have Fear Ward. Do not tell me that's for PvP only.
---
Fact is, there is more players rolling horde because they think that's "the most hardcore PvP players" will be there and, in the same, prevail them of being ganked by an overpopulated opposite faction.
---
The same issue happenned with the horde being camped in 2004-05. You know what happened? Some alliance players got bored of the long BGs queues, they started to roll horde.
---
at no point did i say i supported or was against faction queues, i'm just saying your post is based in emotion rather than rational thought
---
Why? Over a bad idea? Are any of you rage quitting Alliance actually going to argue for why this should happen or are you all just going to keep pretending I'm mad?
---
&gt;Heroic strike and bloodthirst generates more threat than sunder armor
---
No, you\`re wrong. Sunder armor gives you  261  threat, heroic strike gives  145 .
---
Wat? Pvp servers have always been more popular than pve.  Even back in vanilla.
---
I'll look into it if we do go that route!  What's good about Atiesh?
---
Could always reroll on PvE.
---
I actually played in Mal'ganis Retail Horde side, I felt sorry for the allies, is exactly the opposite of Pagle.
---
*Sir, their orcish infantry have broken through our lines. They've made a breach and the undead mages are pouring through*
---
-*Send in the gnomish shield brigade, extra tighty whiteys*
---
*Yes sir!*
---
Tragedy of the Commons
---
I didn't know we were talking specifically about this phase. The PvP complaints and the "sounds like pvp happened in a pvp server" debate has been going on for over a decade.
---
For the immediate situation, yea it's a lot more frequent then before. What did you expect? The main feature of this phase was introducing honor, the PvP currency... Ideally they would have brought BGs along with it, but that didn't happen. It'll pass.
---
I mean an iron grenade isn’t really try hard - a thorium grenade maybe...
---
...and spell power?
---
I agree. i'm all for pvp. i love fighting someone my level or slightly above. It can be challenging. the fights do not even always have to be fair. sometimes i can handle a 1 v 2 or 3. But what i can not handle are people 20 levels higher than me killing me in packs of 10. I stand no chance at all. PVP is fun a on a server with a good faction balance.
---
"I'll have to quit the game"
---
World pvp will die down a lot in a week or two. Most people are not interested in world pvp after they have their insignia and cheaper mount ranks.
---
will do next time, sorry about that.
---
Should add killing lowbies as a dk to reduce no skill aoe lag fests. All the warriors and rogues are standing around while mages are spamming aoe
---
Heroic strike scales with the damage.
---
Horde from razorgore here. We're not safe anywhere from ally.
---
Outpost outside dire maul? Ringed in, can't leave.
---
Flight path closest to brd? Jump, active camp, can't move an inch. (rip getting to ubrs or brd) 
---
Wanna leave org or TB? Better believe it's camped.
---
Argent dawn landing? *que hair trimmer noise*
---
So idk what unluck i got as a horde player there but, my faction just isn't doing active work.
---
I'm just someone that knows what to expect out of an mmorpg and not compain when the thinkable happens. Not sure what to say about someone signing up for the possibility of being mc'd and griefed in an actual toxic manner and then crying about it.
---
Where at all? You pretending I'm mad doesn't magically make me mad. The reasoning behind why faction specific queues is a horrible idea is logically sound.
---
Go into any of the dozens of threads asking for it and go make the same logically arguments I did. You'll just get insulted. So why are you guys mad I made my post so straight foward shitting on that awful idea?
---
They are rarely covering the entire area. Its a few clumps of people with empty space in between.
---
Lok'Tar O'Gar.
---
I started playing wow for the first time in September. I'm a lvl 45 night elf hunter. now with the honor system I'm finding out I truly suck at pvp. I don't know what to do. It feels like I'm outnumbered 3-1 by horde and unless I catch someone off guard I die pretty easily in pvp ... i can't complete any quests because I'm always made someone's bitch lol
---
This is fake news
---
why is this so funny haha thanks im laughed
---
the droprate for robes of arcana can go fuck itself
---
I believe you misspelled Atiesh Alliance sir. :)
---
Most populated pve realm according to ironforge logs
---
Let me reestablish some points from this conversation you may have missed:
---
1. I don’t like people who form group specifically to take ALL orbs during a run
---
2. When I see a group LF a tank I ask if they mind letting me have the first orb
---
3. I get the orb I res, and I continue on with the group and let them need roll the rest until everybody has one
---
The “type of player” I am referring to is the kind that takes advantage of others and not being a team player. It’s not a waste of time for me (as you put it) because I get my orb, but I also help other players through the dungeon who may end up wiping because they group with self centered players who are only in it for the gold.
---
If you’re trying to defend this type of behavior that’s fine, just means I don’t agree with your play style and we would probably butt heads in game. /shrug
---
AFAIK alliance can't transfer off Herod.
---
Because that took almost 2 months and people are here begging for it after 2 days.
---
Ah fair enough. Yeah I'm learning with classic at least there can be a couple of ways to achieve the desired outcome with macros. I recall I always used /cast with trinkets in BC.
---
Yeah it's hard to imagine it being worse than what I experienced but I know it definitely can be.
---
Just saying but I have heard from numerous horde that they agree with faction specific queues. Personally speaking though, is it really fun steamrolling people in wpvp? I myself can barely play my 54 rogue without getting dumpstered by 3+ people. Now don’t get me wrong, I rolled a pvp server and I knew that this would happen. I guess I just thought level 60’s wanted to work a little harder, not just killing levelers who are half HP after a mob. I don’t know man... but this just isn’t conducive for a healthy future of the game I think.
---
Only for 3 deaths, after that it's pointless.
---
you're probably receiving insults because you're literally shitting on an idea and not even attempting to propose a solution yourself. try being cooperative and brainstorming instead of just adding hate.
---
Holy paladins are the best pvp healer in the game by FAR.  Also alliance racials aren’t that bad, they’re just not as OP as wotf and stun resist.
---
2 arcanes and 1 blue sapphire.... in one node!
---
It's an rpg not an esport. There are no fair fights in classic wow.
---
I am not an altoholic so zero alts here. Brd minimum req is 52... Also, I tried to get into Mara since I could enter by my level range..problem is, most people only want 60 only groups. The new meta is seriously ruining everything lol.
---
My favorite PvP is world PvP. I'm enjoying every minute, played maybe 12 hours today in a huge binge. Can't wait to do the same tomorrow.
---
We form up a 20-40 ppl raid in order to farm honour and fight, not to sit on the same place and protect questing guys. Time is up, you can no longer do quests outside. Go to dungeons, roll on PvE server or roll horde, not my problem.
---
alliance have good racials and horde have better racial. 
---
that isn't really the point tho, the point is yes the only option for anyone right now is for some horde players to reroll. let's see how that goes. I would suggest getting comfy till BGs come out tho and then PvP will be way more fun for everyone
---
I did multiple times but I guess I shoulda known trolls don't understand intelligence.
---
How do you deal with L1 alts griefing? All group pvp stops and only single target abilities are now pvp viable?
---
So then greys can attack a 60 with no retaliation.
---
Removed... Awesome. Thanks OP
---
No. I was there.
---
it makes no difference ... besides a yard and a meter are like 92% identical
---
Once you get to the high 20s/low 30s chaining SM dungeons should pull ahead of questing. This may not be true if you are Alliance.
---
You are never oom as a warlock
---
I chose a PvP server because I wanted questing to feel tense and potentially dangerous. Was that a mistake? If I'm going to just get rolled over by impossibly stronger players, am I just going to get burned out trying to get by on my server?
---
You're clueless.   I played on pvp servers in actual classic.  This is a goddamned clusterfuck.   Horde AEing flightpaths because people don't get honorless target when they land. ANother priest MCing people and using them to kill npcs to get dishonorable kills.  80 horde on the chokepoint going into BRM getting their 'honorable kills'. So honorable.  15 at every flightpath, 10 below the flightpath, a STRING of 30+ on the route TO BRM.  30 INSIDE BRM. 20-40 more strewn throughout the path to BRD.   This is the exact opposite of fun and will only led to further faction imbalances.  There are 40 alliance in searing gorge right now.   I cannot even count the horde, there are over 400, though.   "It's world pvp! NO Sympathy!  I'm an idiot! DERP"
---
If it wasn't ally heavy I would
---
It’d just whatever the majority pop is on the server. Dude probably plays on a horde favored server. It’s the same in reverse when alliance is the majority.
---
They certainly did not know as much of the game as we do now. They had an idea sure but even now we are finding new things out. For example, human rogues using swords only need 1% hit plus the 5% hit talent in combat. And only one point in the expertise talent to get hit capped. This just recently came to light with the release of classic even though this could have been found out in Vanilla I assume.
---
I’m curious what you are basing that on. I do think that certain classes attract shittier people.
---
60 lock here. At what point is it worth it to go for Hit instead of purely max SP? I'm pretty much pre-raid BiS (except Wand) and got Felheart Robes (20 int, 31 stam, 10 FR, 1% hit, 13 SP) which have Hit but is an SP decrease from Felcloth Robe (10 int, 36 SP). Which would you equip?
---
raid geared dps warriors are godlike dungeon tanks
---
Is not horde problems.... has nothing to do with factions, is about the BIG difference in populations of factions... Makes Horde ranking almost impossible.
---
Why aren't you guys transferring or rerolling then? Why should I not be able to play because people don't like playing Alliance? How do you expect to solve the issue of most servers being imbalanced?
---
Your idea would destroy the game in a week.
---
So much salt
---
How does alliance transferring or rerolling help the imbalanced population size of horde and alliance? If alliance transfer or reroll won’t it just make a greater gap?
---
&gt;PvP was fun in Classic because fights were usually organic,
---
In vanilla, you mean
---
Vanilla != Classic
---
It's honestly not the worst opener for a combat pve rogue. You can't cheap+gouge as a combat rogue. It literally costs too much.
---
I wish this were true but i've spent about 2 days trying to find skrimishes, and it's always 10v2 or 50 v 50, literally no small groups around.
---
Ffs man 😂
---
this is bullshit - there were plenty of corpse camping arseholes in vanilla.
---
Lasher farm with herb can net close to 50g / hr
---
IDK man, Halo 2 was out in late 2004 and there were some real cocksuckers on there too.
---
They were combat.
---
You're missing the part where it has a threat multiplier to the damage done.
---
They were combat. Try playing combat vs a frost mage and i'll wait here while you come up with a way to apologize to them.
---
Every class had its own worst enemy. What made me good at PvP was a shit ton of battlegrounds in vanilla. I don't know when that'll come but, only practice can make you good at it. Also, look up hunter PvP videos to see what the meta is and strategies
---
Most classes all have little extra quests to unlock class flavor abilities. Druids and shaman come to mind as two with pretty interesting flavors and class specific quests throughout that aren’t entirely horrible to level overall. Can get groups easier because both can heal which is nice as well. 
---
 
---
Locks have pets which you said you don’t particularly like but they also are very good solo with some excellent class flavor.
---
Priest, paladin, and warrior are all slowish levelers and somewhat group dependent. Mages might be a good one from a solo standpoint and they have a lot of quality of life abilities. Rogues are kind of middle of the road levelers with a good bit of flavor but not quite as rich as others in that department, not that they can’t be immensely fun if you like their particular brand of play.
---
I realize this is all my opinion and others may disagree. Just trying to be helpful.
---
They were combat...
---
Why would Alliance be forced to reroll or transfer?
---
Can't PvP lololol. You're a brain dead moron horde who can't see past your massive advantage to want to help the game as a whole. I'm not trying anymore you don't want to discuss you just want to be salty and stir up shit. Go drink anti freeze
---
Put it this way: being able to use the most ineficient spell you can for a fight to top meters and not go oom is a sign of a skilled healer.
---
It's also the only way we can have fun atm unless you do split 20 mans or clear in under an hour.
---
So you plan to dump 1k gold into crafting mats then sit on them for a few months for them to go up and sell at a slight profit? That's way worse of an investment then spending 1) gold to make 420g minimum a month.
---
No one is complaining fuck nugget.
---
It also takes immensely more Thorium to craft an item or level a profession with it. At higher level BS it takes 20 thorium per skill point.
---
This makes absolutely no sense?
---
Right now it's nonstop PvP in just about every zone you can imagine.
---
How would that help the game as a whole? Because you feel better? Making Horde literally unable to play because you're upset you die is how you kill the game.
---
Ok, I'll bite. Why is rose better than imp sprint?
---
&gt;5 people that primarily drop mail.
---
BLOODmail. AKA "that useless set".
---
Gonna need some proof on that. Statistically, its not likely.
---
sharding as the average player understands ("stormwind is so empty/i tried to loot a node and it vanished when i got closer") is what hes referring to. all layering is, is sharding but continent wide (really, it's phasing just with a term to differentiate it from the wotlk popularization of the term). and sharding, layering and phasing are all based on the same tech (the tech that lets them compartmentalize multiple versions of the same place at once). in truth theres no accurate term to refer to these zones having their own portions of server space other than 'sharding but not layered shards'
---
Nobody likes getting shit on, but some people sure like telling others that they should like getting shit on
---
Argument? Arguing with you would be like arguing with a pissed off cat. But a cat is scarier than you are. 😏
---
And right now alliance is unplayable so what's your point? It's you or me and I choose me everytime
---
luckily for you, you still wont be able to play a game you never played anyway!! all worked out for the best
---
I’m horde on stalag and it fucking sucks
---
DPS is pretty good, usually top for non-AoE pulls, but if you look at overall damage it's shit, because you need to drink every other pull.
---
Stupid reddit app made a new comment not replying to your reply. But in your reply to my original response that is your solution, no? Your first sentence is along the lines that we should transfer or reroll.
---
you must be playing horde right?
---
And he’s going blind
---
His character isn't even called falcorn.. fail.
---
No yeah you'd rather fling shit like a monkey. Notice how I'm not directly insulting anyone here and I'm getting told to kill myself among dozens of other insults?
---
Back when the census results were first posted, there were numbers to back the unfair wpvp feeling on skeram. So, people didn't want to waste their time anymore and moved to heartseeker, which is why the ratio is fucked in reverse for heartseeker. All of the horde dominated servers had all of their alliance transfer off so we could actually play the game.
---
On skeram before we transferred, my warlock once got ganked by 5 unique people before I could even summon my pet.
---
I mean having the lowbies dive into any AoEs the 60s drop. Or mixing into enemy groups (say during run to MC) to deter being attacked. Civilians at least have static locations. You can avoid those.
---
LvL 20 isn't much, most midcore guilds have multiple people with at least one extra L60 character.
---
Fucking no brainer here
---
taking any kind of guide in wowhead seriously is just wrong
---
If you want those big ambush crits and still want to level swords I suggest doing research on weapon swap macros. You should be able to have a macro that equips a dagger in mainhand and use ambush then another macro to equip your sword and use hemorrhage.
---
Classic music for a classic vid
---
release flying mounts!
---
Well that's a fuckin shame.
---
There was definitely DR in TBC at the least.
---
now hold on
---
Only thing I would change about faerlina is all the asmon followers, they don't hit 60 and if they ninja
---
They tried once but bailed as soon as we turned on them, after that they abandoned him to his fate hahaha.
---
Thrash blade is really quite efficient and competitive all the way through molten core for combat or hemo specs. Krol blade and Sword of Zeal are obviously better but I think saving for an epic mount would help more in PvP to create an advantage.
---
As you probably know daggers allow more versatility of spec including seal fate/prep, combat daggers, or hemo also, and more big burst to start (and end) a fight fast.
---
Lots to choose from. Rogue is the best class 🥰
---
Comes down to what you value more: quick burst and solo pvp (daggers) or more sustained damage adding more value to group  pvp.
---
Source: rogue main since 2005!
---
try relogging
---
Same on my EU server, very friendly duels.
---
I think it was really only post-cata that PvE started becoming more popular because that's when one-faction-servers started becoming the rule rather than the exception.
---
Classic likely would have followed a similar course to vanilla (even if reversed, faction-wise) if nu-blizzard hadn't made the worst possible choices every step of the way (overly low initial server count, overly high initial server cap, faction agnostic transfers opened during the launch week rush and kept open for nearly a month, etc etc all the way through)
---
Good point. Pints up for some ambitious upstart at Blizzard shooting it down.
---
That was the thing with choosing PvP: you were in it.   Early decisions like server, race, faction and class really define you.  They once allowed transfer from PvP to PvE, so maybe.
---
I just started a mage, is it more efficient to spam frost bolt solely or mix in flame burst now and then?
---
I basically quit because of that. Took me an hour to get to dungeons. Having to run from the flight path to the dungeon 4 times before you can enter is only fun so many times. Could take up to an hour to get to brd. Not worth it. Should've rolled pve in stead.
---
Oh well. Leveling was fun while it lasted.
---
Oh, attempting the high road argument. After flinging corn laced diahrea all over your original post, I think you have no room to speak.

Because it doesn't. Stop making stuff up.
---
we need an updated link
---
An interesting scenario, I say even if a lowbie is hidden among 60s the penalty could be avoided by using actual strategy instead of mindless zerg aoe spam.
---
Okey. But who cares?
---
do you have link?
---
I assumed you were horde side, I was saying why aren't those horde you said that want to be unable to play the game just reroll or transfer?
---
Coc is super op, instant cast means if you freeze someone you can do a quick frost bolt + coc combo and both would get the increased crit chance, it’s a huge burst
---
What server are you on? Miranedia is an old friend, been trying to get in contact with him :)
---
beta
---
make it a titan panel addition
---
But you sound like a child. So I wrote you off. Next time try not ranting and targeting the opposite faction. We aren't all the same and we all play the same game. We are a community. Lets foster that. Have a great day, friend. 😁
---
Lol what?
---
If you know the economy it's very easy to capitalize. All you need to know is what gets added in future content.
---
just curious what's wrong with trying to balance out the factions and fix queues at the same time?
---
Try your servers server discord
---
...even that is unfair wtf I don’t get how anyone defends it lol
---
I'm sorry I had to, I know redditors are notorious for not reading articles or posts but not even reading the title is like next level.
---
Go To ReTaiL
---
so amazing
---
In the end with your plan all you'll achieve is everyone who plays alliance is to be punished for playing ally which is hardly a solution.
---
Okay friend.
---
the only fights that happen in this game is fair 1v1 full health fights of skilled gamers against keyboard turners who will complain on the internet when they die
---
you heard it here first, people
---
Yeah for sure. I have yet to do it myself, was just asking. I'm only 40 still
---
i've tried relogging, reloading my battlenet client, /reload ui for days now...
---
Wish this happened to me. I once gave 160 lvl 55 water and 160 food to a hunter and he tipped me 25s.....
---
I still give to all who ask. I even give portals free to all who ask, tips always appreciated tho.
---
i did...
---
That doesn’t match with my recollection at all. I distinctly remember your title matching your current rank.
---
They’re talking about PvP, and the Stam on T1 belt is worth a lot more in PvP.
---
Yes
---
one of my alts updated but my main didnt. strange
---
It wasn’t showing it for me either before today when I relogged and it suddenly worked
---
This is a great list
---
Nothing I said is at odds with that...Maybe stop,taking things so personally?
---
What’s a different one you find accurate?
---
when you are trying to world pvp it sucks. they are very laggy
---
Wild guess, the 3 of us and the 63 other people who upvoted him/her are prolly quite old? I'd guess at least 27-28+...but man was/is it a good song!
---
If it is so then nothing can be done
---
I am just as baffled as you. This is on a PvP server and he's just out here farming mobs like a badass
---
Real actions bars have curves.
---
These points are valid but beyond the obvious theorycrafting were easily observed on private servers.
---
So I don't know if this was your intent but the notion that somehow you couldnt predict the current game state is an absolute joke.
---
\*\* Also: And I really can't stress this enough, the notion that current gamer culture is more toxic now than 15 years ago isn't even an argument. It's not close. You weren't there then, and anyone making this argument wasn't there. I know this because I was there and you're a snowflake.\*\* 
---
If you think what I just said is rude or offensive then you wouldn't last 5 minutes in 2004 online gaming. Grow up.
---
This. Hell, I had a 48 druid and 32 play. Rerolled my paladin elsewhere
---
 Never looking back
---
I know that, the message was more meant for all the people whining about how PvP is ruining their PvE experience, and your post was the most relevant to respond to. I was agreeing with your move, more than anything else. And hey, I was the first to do something on reddit, I'm so proud.
---
i recall corpse walking to brd before p2
---
Most pvp servers are horde imbalanced, and most pve is vice versa. This isn't majority minority faction like you're depicting, cuz that ignores the fact that is an entirely pvp discussion, where pvp servers are more relevant when discussing imbalance.  Alliance are, in general, really way more fucked than horde when in comes to pvp. Did I also forget to add that horde racials explain all of this
---
Who cares if people think I'm a child? I'd rather be a child than a person with a shit idea to ruin the game. I have no sypathy for these people trying to punish me. I've spent the last hour getting insulted in every thread. I spoke my mind in my initial post and I'm not being disrespectful to anyone here.
---
Yet look at all the hate and insults I get.
---
You still have to go to the instance in the zone the big is in to que.. and they were always camped back in the day as well. 
---
You can’t just sit in the city and que bgs in old wow.
---
Yeah if I'm 15 again I'm spending my time banging 15 year olds while its legal.
---
Nothing technically.  Problem is most wont leave because the destination servers are bad
---
there is a lot of good world pvp to be had at these zone boundaries, but they are unplayably laggy
---
I’m shopping for a good pve server, where u at?
---
You're a trash player if you gank someone 10 levels below you. End of.
---
Lol. Yeah. Their fault people transferred off.
---
Im saying they're trash. Which they are.
---
Sorry if that bothers you.
---
Cause im not a trash player.
---
Trash players will be trash though. Not much you can do about it.
---
Land at kargath and run.
---
Yeah I had to quit as well. I can’t swing the type of time commitment it would take to withstand the constant zerg camps. It would be better as Horde, I’m sure, but the whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I see your posts. You are extremely disrespectful, arrogant and unmoving. Why not sound like a child? Maybe you would be taken seriously. Maybe you wouldnt get constant insults and people like me that immediately target this kind of shit for a laugh. "If you smell shit everywhere you, check your own shoe."
---
The point of this post is faction imbalance, not queue length. you can definitely pin fraction imbalance at least partially on blizzard
---
Fucking reroll in classic like it takes no time at all.
---
Imagine unironically thinking that is a solution.
---
been relogging since friday and nothing
---
That guy literally thinks his personal experience is as valid as the wave of alliance complaining. He will never admit he's wrong lol
---
I'm pretty sure you never even touched this game till after WoD you fucking child.
---
So, technically, greens with +spellpower will output more damage. Just by virtue of 1 spellpower = ~8 int in terms of damage. But if you put yourself in all greens with no stats you just get blown the fuck up in some fights. You also run the risk of going OOM a lot faster. Most guides take this into mind and have a well balance of the highest spellpower you can get while still having some stats.
---
Hey question for you, do you think this is bis for 19 hunters? Or is a 2h better?
---
Funny enough, streamers want BGs the most. They don't like streamsniping.
---
I just love that I can go to any high level zone and find fighting everywhere.
---
24 lowbies to gank so far, more more more!
---
6 minute? You sure it wouldn't be 6 hour WSG?
---
Servers like herod where the horde is completely dominating 80/20 will NEVER be balanced. There is no way people are gonna transfer from it somewhere else as a horde. Besides, there are people who desperately need help - alliance players, but they are not allowed to move. There is no difference for the horde to play 4000 vs 100 or 4000 vs 0 - the server’s balance is already ruined and never gonna recover, just it let be a horde server. But for those 100 poor guys it would’ve been a huge difference - to play 2000 vs   2000 instead of 100 vs 4000, but for some reason they have to suffer. Which is unfair.
---
i feel you. i’ll kill a person lower level 1-3 times, not corpse camping (usually), but for instance today in Badlands i came across 50/55s and killed two or three of them 1v1 maybe twice, as i was farming gromsblood. Only thing i could suggest would be to move to a different area at that point or do an instance or level fishing¿
---
The 90's were an odd, beautiful time my friend.

I dont think video games are a waste of time. I think watching other people MC you for an extended amount of time is  a waste of time.

But different strokes for different folks, time enjoyed isnt wasted I guess.
---
I should've done a rp server. They really are the nicest lads
---
We don’t know yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a system put in place that keeps premades competing against other premades and vice-versa
---
Oh no I have no respect for people who just insult me! If I sound like a child to you I really do not give a shit. The insults don't bug me at all, it's the lack of any arguments. And frankly I'm not even caring about that right now when people like you who "target" this shit don't even have half a clue what thread you're even in.
---
Oh no not having a person like you on my side is such a loss!
---
Nah, most people still suck.
---
That's why I rolled pve to start. Knew the honor phase was going to be like this. Personally I hate the WPvP without objectives, no reason people should be "farming" other people when they could be fighting others over objectives
---
Literally the only comment in this thread that didn’t make me blow my brains out reading it, ily.
---
I haven't experienced that, but I'll take your word for it. Let's complain!
---
Alliance on herod are having a field day with all the level 50+ horde trying to level in places like Felwood, WPL, Winterspring, Un'Goro, Silithus, Blasted Lands, etc
---
Need more horde balance on myzrael
---
Don't even talk about the boats from menethil to theramore
---
Id you don't think Horde not even be able to play wouldn't cause them to mass quit then amazing.
---
Yep, exactly.
---
Imagine making your character on a PvP server then whining about dying in PvP. Truly a pathetic display. Probably a bunch of you turds following your meme FOTM streamer and now that they quit you're stuck. get rekt
---
The ones who won't accept the problem are the ones whining thinking it's going to change anything.  A more logical approach of a person who has accepted that there is a problem would be to adjust his playstyle accordingly to minimize the impacts of said problem.
---
I'm on the french servers
---
Ahaha I’m in her guild as well. Bloodsail best server.
---
I know most people are in the complete No Changes camp.
---
But would you like a World-PVP day where Battlegrounds are turned completely off, say one day a month, so we could continue having some world-pvp action every so often once a month after P2 ends?
---
Perhaps bonus exp could be given on that day...?
---
It might be, Destinite posted a video from what i presume is from the same night on their youtube channel
---
Eh, I know a rogue who sits in a raid in stealth and just collects HKs, afk. Douche move for sure but 0 effort for 100s of HKs an hour.
---
It's actually amazing if you have friends. I play on a massively imbalanced server as the lesser faction and wpvp is incredibly fun with 5 other people just finding places to get fair fights. We've been fighting near the wpl/trisfal glades boarder for days and have endless encounters with other groups of similar size. We don't always win but it's more fun than bgs that's for sure. Or being able to walk outside of IF and see a horse raid trying to breach the gates for hours..or even just countering the rogue gank squads roaming around IF....wpvp is making the game far more exciting and interesting. Obviously balanced pvp is ideal but what we have now is also good.
---
If Horde racials are so uncontestedly better then why do hardcore/competitive guilds like APES play alliance?
---
I was doing it with 5.9k! But at like 6.5k and it’s much better
---
Its not too late really, I have a 40 something warlock on herod and just started a rogue on bloodsail
---
There was obviously some problem.  It was showing group and raid (all empty slots) at the same time.  Maybe it was related to the latest beta branch i downloaded?  I will try regular release.
---
false, on my server the highest queues are tuesday nights because that is when most people raid MC...
---
Barring one side from entering the game world at all is incredibly bad, be it Alliance or Horde. As pointed out in another comment: if a faction outnumbers the other by such a great number that the opposing faction never will be able to keep up in numbers, there could be scenarios where players in the number-dominant faction would NEVER be able to play on that server. I can’t even begin to think how shitty I would feel in this case, especially if I had already put in the time to reach level 60 and grinded gear during phase 1, which a large number of people have done. Not being able to enter the world at all is tenfold times worse than being able to enter, but getting ganked.
---
People seem to be really frustrated, which lead to these garbage «solutions» out of desperate wishful thinking. I just think that people feel that they have chosen the «wrong side», and that they are now paying for it.
---
People are established in guilds and communities already, especially on the dominant side. They won’t leave.
---
This.
---
Faction balance on most servers was fine... until they opened the free transfers letting people escape to servers where their faction was dominant.
---
Yeah, people getting level 60 and other small accomplishments always get upvoted, but when I post something like this ofc I get downvotwed and blamed. Not that it matters to me anyway, though.
---
Wand. Worth it to get from auction house before something better drops. Wand goes to the ranged weapon slot. 2 other slots should be for any weapons with good stats, preferably + frost damage or + intellect. You just carry those weapons for stats and use only wand
---
This sub is sooo out of touch with the actual game it’s ridiculous. Usually I don’t get why streamers hate on Reddit. But I understand. This subreddit is fucking TRASH lmaooo
---
ye this map is rly nice, anyone know name addon?
---
&gt; it's parallel to bully behaviour
---
Comparing videogames to bullying sounds like a stretch. Camping someone in WoW is nowhere near as serious as actual bullying.
---
&gt; The fact that there's nothing to really discourage the behaviour
---
There is something to discourage that behaviour and it's the fact that doing that won't give you shit, just waste your time. If someone is doing that, it's because they enjoy it in one way or another.
---
&gt; I'd have some ingame mechanics to deal with it
---
Not completely in game, I guess, but there are different types of server for a reason. Of course people like playing differently. For that there are different types of servers you can choose to fit your playstyle. For the longest time (pretty much since TBC) I played on PvE servers, precisely because I didn't want to be in the situations we're discussing. Now I'm on a PvP server because I wanna experience the world in its entirety including the possibility of getting fucked if I cross the wrong person's path.
---
This is a 15 year old game, we have every single bit of information on how things are gonna go. It's up to each player to choose a play style they enjoy and a server/community to go with it.
---
Term? sorry, i should have said booma.

Hillsbrad got old quick. 
---
I've really enjoyed PvP'ing in EPL/WPL, Un Goro, Silithus, Felwood, and Searing Gorge/Burning Steppes aside from the occasional raid blowing through. We've had a good amount of 5v5 style fights
---
Where's your motivation?
---
You’re a fucking dumbass kid lmaooo
---
Hillsbrad got old quick and I'm not sure its even a faster honor grind versus smaller scale 
---
Planning on primarily dungeon-leveling my Paladin, with the occasional solo-quest venture when finding groups is slow. What should my primary spec be? Should I just go full ret and gather intellect gear for healing dungeons? Or should I spec full holy, or even a prot/holy hybrid?
---
the love is mutual dude
---
They definitely were. People are much more sensitive today than 15 years ago and thus feel as if its worse simply because they get offended at many more things now than before. Like the word "toxic" was never used in the current 'definition' it has today, that pretty much tells you what you need to know.
---
ok boomer
---
Handsome!
---
Five digit password eh?  Someone’s feelin’ confident.
---
They need to add wsg before phase 3. Vanilla had less populated servers and fewer people tryharding pvp grind.
---
Exactly lol. this dude is just BUTTHURT he didn’t get 60 before phase two and now he can’t level. “Wahhh every one who kills me is trash WAHHHH” lmao.  Not even making any logical statements. Just “they’re trash”.
---
I don’t think the premades will be that bad. There will definitely be some, but most people will be just trying to get some games in and taking randoms. 
---
Honestly bgs are the main reason I have been excited about classic since it was announced.  I am probably just going to level alts till they come out. And if they aren’t fun, that will be it for me.
---
Seriously, welcome to wow. This is what pvp is. 
---
You’ll have streaks of getting rekt by 60s with nothing better to do. But then you’ll have streaks of being fine.
---
Nope, I saw other members in another persons raid have the gear on them. Trust me. Its a really fucked bug.
---
Yup, they are letting their frustration rot their brains. Faction specific queue is not a solution. I did see someone else say that doing it globally (ex entire horde % and entire alliance % spread out over all PvP servers in a region) may work.
---
But that's entirely dependent on the players taking the transfers still. Barring someone from playing the game because they pick the faction they like best would really make me leave forever.
---
Its cross realm bg so que times wont be big for either side.
---
The point is that gold depreciates in value every day, whilst investing and divesting your gold into valuables means your money will at the very least remain constant with the rate of inflation. It's basic economics.
---
sorry girls don't like you &lt;shrug&gt;
---
Ganks squad were expected for the beginning of P2, right now it's the new thing that everyone is doing. Even people that have no intention (whether they realize it yet or not) of ranking up are roaming in gank squad.
---
Give it a couple days, couple weeks maybe and they'll mostly go away.
---
what happens in goldshire, stays in goldshire
---
Hardcore kids on overpopulated realms with nothing better to do between raids will be campaign FPs all day until BGs come out.
---
I play on Skeram Horde and I think it’s lame.
---
Not a hard concept. But do you have any idea how to implement it into the client? You can't sit here saying something is easy to do when you've no concept of how it'd actually work.
---
Everyone wins ... Except the people that cant get on their character:p
---
Hey I'm not talking about you, brother. Just the whiny Alliance players who chose to play on massively overpopulated servers and then say that they're the only ones who know what its liked to be ganked.
---
:D
---
Damage done is 1 threat per damage, multiplied by 1.425 from defensive stance with defiance talent. That's added to the base threat of heroic strike which is 145 for our highest rank and 175 for the upcoming rank according to the threat spreadsheet.
---
I'm pretty sure the way it worked (and maybe how it still works now?) was that you had separate categories of DRs, so you could sheep at full duration once the target can't be mind controlled anymore, then fear, then stun, etc etc. and then go back around to MC once they were vulnerable to that again. That sort of extreme situation doesn't really need to be balanced around since if you have enough people to do that to a single character you can trivially just kill them, so there's no need to go that far... unless you're pulling something completely insane like this.
---
Yes i would love it! That way i can make sure my house is cleaned once a month :)
---
But it's what people want.  You can look at retail and people massively flock to not only the mega servers, but the dominant factions on servers.  The blame on blzizard is what?  That they didn't deliberately cut off the limits until the factions were balanced?
---
What if Horde is like 65%+ of the total game's population?  Do you want every server to be like that?  What if a server gets capped because alliance don't go there and then further alliance stop playing?  Do you want to put a faction queue on a low pop server if it is struggled to get 500 people online?
---
The reality is that this is not a solution because the inherent problem is the playerbase.  None of them want it to happen to THEM, but they want it to happen to others.
---
I reckon it will pick up quite a bit whenever people start to struggle on bosses and start using flasks.
---
If you are farming herbs on my realm right now, Mountain Silversage is the way to go.
---
Yeah I agree, not letting some people play, because others do not want to, because of the state of the game is not a reasonable solution at all.
---
to each their own.. i joined nost/elysium specifically to spend all day every day inside AV.
---
Small, evenly matched groups. Sounds like everybody wants arenas. (me too)
---
Honestly, PVP worlds are deemed unplayable to me until this shit cools down. I would either reroll a separate character on a PVE server or cancel your sub - its not worth the time or frustration IMO and thats not including vendor repairs and stuff from the constant ganking.
---
It's amazing how Blizzard got a lot of shit for saying, "you think you want it, but you don't" now look at how upset everyone is over something that was in the game.
---
Its much more than 10-15g on my server at least - essence of undeath is 1g, and essence of water is always 20+, sometimes even 30. So I would estimate it to be much closer to 20g a day than 12.5g a day, at least on my server.
---
All my friends rolled on a pvp server, so I joined them, and now they ditched and i'm stuck here alone. welp
---
Dude if you play WoW Classic on a PvP server you have already given up any kind of valuing of your free time.
---
Thanks for the link, I'll just give up on the PvP rewards after seeing that.
---
It's not at all like vanilla now.  The groups dont even really fight they just run back and forth and the majority of deaths are people who get caught in the charge.  At least that's how it's been on my server.
---
Only one way to know: test it. I personnally get tilted very fast from 60 ganks on lowbies. Good thing i enjoy dungeon leveling, i can switch to that if i need to. Also the hype will probably die at some point, its just hard to tell when
---
What schedule? At what point has there been any kind of schedule? There's only talk of cryptic "phases" with no indication of their release intervals and almost none of it was even a napkin concept when Classic was originally released. Don't give me that bullshit. Phase 3 still has no official release date. I've had people tell me anywhere from February to fucking August 2020 and Phase 2 was announced something like 2 WEEKS before it was implemented.
---
Herod is not 80/20 lol its like 40/60. Stalagg isnt even 80/20 and its the worst alli realm.
---
The shameless hearth after got me
---
You have no one to blame but yourself. This is a pvp server. Stop expecting to be catered to
---
I'm just coming up to level 53 as a Warrior. Where should I quest next, hopefully somewhere that I will not be ranked to death?
---
Ehh idk, griefing is being a dick for no reason or benefit. Sure it feels shitty to get camped, but at least someone gets honor for it...now 2 weeks ago, body camping was 100% griefing, but now there's an incentive to do it
---
*Laughs in PvE server*
---
pve servers tend to heavily alliance skewed.
---
I believe when ZG comes out it has some BiS patterns, so no concrete answer but something to think about before dropping
---
I've been playing around with vanish. I respected and went full increased stealth and got the boots with +1 stealth.
---
I went from combat daggers, vanish never working, regardless of my distance from mobs to fill stealth farming spec where I can vanish in the center of numerous hostile mobs with zero problem.
---
I plan to do some detailed tests later. Additionally, pick pocket success rates also seem tied to stealth level.
---
well that's weird but good luck with that
---
So many people need essence of water that the price should stay high, but if undeath is so high there probably are a load of people with undesth to water. I bet water is cheaper for horde too on most servers just because felwood is most often owned by horde
---
Imln context it does. 5-10 man group is reasonably small for the curremt state of wpvp.
---
Spell power
---
I don’t believe so. But, they’ve made some changes.
---
pve servers are alliance dominated. :S
---
why are there so much more horde than alliance? I always thought alliance was the more popular faction
---
I see what you're saying and I would chat with the wife about signing up for a softball team or having a poker night with the guys, but it feels wrong to me to let my wife handle a 2 year old and a 4 month old, including bathing them and putting them to bed, so I can play video games in the next room. I understand some people would, but maybe the game is more important to them than it is to me. I really enjoy raiding, but not enough to make those other sacrifices for. 
---
So no, I dont agree that I am whipped because I cant raid because of my wife and kids. I think I just have different priorities. And yes, if I didnt have a wife and kids I would be far more likely to reserve a night each week to raid.
---
and people wonder why pvpers are considered scum, its people like you. you dont give a shit about anyone but yourself. your a piece of trash,the scum of humanity......and u dont even deny it.
---
roll on Atiesh... I just gave up on that server and I'm looking to reroll.
---
Times when every other PVE server had minimum 30-40 on both sides in TM/SS, Atiesh would have maybe 15.
---
Feel like I just wasted the last 2 months by choosing to roll on the snorefest server.
---
I don’t think I’m being an asshole. I think I’m explaining how things are, and it sucks, it really sucks but those are the options.
---
I counted 9 corpseruns to get from thorium point to BRM. I simply left the group and logged onto my horde alt on firemaw instead. Having a blast leveling it there, so that's probably where i'm going to spend the most of my time when i'm not raiding.
---
There is no such thing as a fair fight in world pvp
---
Vanilla never had 10k players online at the same time. It was capped at 2.5k but them "this is pvp this is what you signed up for" people cant understand this. Pvp here and pvp in vanilla couldnt be any more different.
---
I guess thats a prime example classic is more fun than retail
---
Probably BRD arena/anger runs while you farm equipment. You'll die getting there, but are safe inside the instance
---
Ahhhh gotcha. To be fair: horde racials are pvp based.
---
Because this sub is filled with content of the exact same style sprinkled with some streamer hate. 
---
But hey, its only obnoxious if retail players do it right? :)
---
Imagine dreaming about having gear in a 15 year old game
---
Yep no point even bothering any more. Bunch of people get notified and you're found before you do anything with a bunch of horde spitting on your corpse and spamming chat macros.
---
World PvP in vanilla was amazing, I really hoped we'd get it back for classic. Instead we got all the worst parts multiplied by 1000 and very very little of the really great stuff.
---
Oh well.
---
Take my server, kirtonos, for example. There was a definite horde majority there before free realm transfers opened up, then realm transfers opened and whole guilds of alliance are leaving. Server had an imbalance that got blown to another level because of this, and our server didn't even need transfers. We've been medium with no queues since the start. Now players on this server are locked in, no transfers off kirtonos. You're telling me blizzard isn't somewhat responsible for the imbalance here?
---
There's being on a pvp server and fighting over resources or denying world buffs and then there's everyone trying to farm honor out in the world.
---
The 2nd one is kinda shit unless there's really good balance. (horde can't fimn enough alliance to kill, alliance can't do anything)
---
I don't know of anyone who actually likes ranking in wpvp
---
i think it was more fun in vanilla because 80% of the server was not mages and not 1000 running back and forth but on a smaller scale so each person matter more.
---
hope BGs come soon because this world pvp is boring
---
Free faction changes for heavily skewed servers would help immensely, but would be really unfair for shamans and paladins who can't faction change.
---
I’ve picked 4.
---
First one was back when I was leveling in Winterspring, one popped up by a furbolg camp being farmed for rep and I managed to snatch it.
---
Second one was by the lumber mill next to Light’s Hope Chapel (Browman I think) when I was running to do Stratholme.
---
Third wasn’t even found by me first, but by a guildie who was mining in the Burning Steppes. He let me know and sat on it, blocking others from picking it (he’s an orc male) while I hs’ed to Kargath and made my way over. Spilt the profit with him as a thanks. Not sure how legal sitting on herbs is, but noone else came before me so I don’t care.
---
Last one so far was when I was farming Mountain Silversage in Winterspring and it was on my route.
---
Basically I «farmed» it just once, but I know all the spawns.
---
The sad state of Classic.
---
herod is so lopsided right now so in my opinion thats best.
---
Typical comment when people bitch to other people about the server imbalances then make fun of them for being Alliance...
---
Releasing BGs will help immensely. Right now the issue is that the only way to grind honor is to simply grief as many people as possible 3 times, then hand them over to the next group who does the exact same thing. 
---
One solution would be to implement a honorless target buff on people who have recently died in pvp combat for a minute or two after they res. Also lowering the range of honor would help alleviate ganking levelers a tiny bit. Or simply give people lower than 55 an option to disable their pvp flag even on pvp servers until BGs are out. 
---
I've been having a blast running around in 15-20 man gank squad, killing the roaming horde groups, but evading the horde raids that are mustered to counter us. We will strike in EPL then move to WPL, only to the port to SW and move to STV or blasted lands. Then we port to darnassus and fly to winterspring and run through felwood to ashenvale. Then back to IF and then to SG/BRM through badlands. All in all I've gotten over 900 HKs in just a the few hours I played, and only gotten wiped 4-5 times.
---
if you think ganking in any sence of the world is even REMOTELY competitive,your more of a piece of trash then i thought. because fighting someone who cant fight back,makes u just as bad as a murderer in real life,u deserve all the bad karma in the world and i hope to fuck it happens to each and every one of you.
---
spy has been around forever, its a well known addon
---
Its cross realm BGs.  You really think that many premades will be out there to where its almost every game? I doubt it.
---
Crying like a baby back bitch
---
You must be playing Alliance, right?
---
&gt;you said there's nothing for 60s to spend their gold not that there was nothing for alchemists specifically to spend there money on.
---
No I said there is nothing for a lot of us 60s to spend gold on because we have all the gear we can buy and we have consumables for months stocked up already.  I never claimed theres was nothing for any 60 to spend there gold on. We're discussing what that transmute recipe is worth so of course we're talking about alchemists. If you wanna point out there are other things to invest in that's fine, but don't get butthirt when I then point out that those things are worse investments then the transmute recipe.
---
They don't actually care to be on a balanced server. Battlegrounds will be cross realm so they don't need to worry about long queues. They get all the.... *prestige* of playing on a pvp server with none of the risk.
---
Jokes on you, I rolled with a premade in vanilla, and yeah it sucks to face that one MC group that was super geared but guess what? Not everyone can do MC and its ridiculously easy and everyone is super geared. 
---
This might be the most balanced version of PvP we've seen in a vanilla setting.
---
Exactly. Call their 10 friends to come back and kill you 10v1 then spit on you and say gO tO ReTaIL because they saw it on reddit.
---
I literally cannot do anything in this game other than jerk off in Org because Alliance death squads are camping every flight path, every entrance into every zone, everything. Spent two hours trying to get to BRM only to log off when my group disbanded.
---
We’ve been 25 manning MC. Not enough 60s on alliance lols. But it’s nice, we all got geared quick
---
Hey so why the 2/2 in Imp Sinister Strike? In case you are in front of target inevitablly?
---
AV wont last for 6 minutes when we can turtle up at the bridge. GET AT ME HORDIES.
---
Go To ScHooL
---
last night on my rogue i was using stealth all the time even just traveling. a warlock i'd never been in view of and i hadn't used any skills recently walked near me, stopped and moved back then began aoe'ing around him. sucks
---
&gt;”it does not fit for my gamestyle so it's not something that should take my money" - bulslhit
---
Video games are supposed to be a fun way to unwind, there are zero obligations
---
A lock has infinite mana though... at the cost of the healer's mana xD
---
This is such a dumb argument too, I can't premade because of real life obligations but literally every bg will be pre made, today's hyperbolic culture is so annoying.
---
Shield wall isn't up 24/7

Wouldn't be surprised if they changed their mind on that one.

Perfect. Thanks for the tips, man!

Not on reddit. The majority of people here are massive Melvins.

Both. You just interchange wep depending on scenario if I remember correctly.

It was a helpful comment. We warned people. They ignored us. Now they're on reddit bitching about ganking.

Quick solution. Quit multi boxing. No one likes those ppl.
---
&gt; I still remember the ~~swifty~~ *indalamar* video on ~~illidan~~ blackrock, with a 2hander and slam. 
---
FTFY
---
Why roll on a pve server at all imo
---
240 hours on AVERAGE to reach 60. Do the math on whether casuals who play 10hrs a week can get to 60 by now.
---
The Beast drops Blademaster Leggings. I'm showing it's a 23% drop rate. He drops 2 items every kill, so on average about 2 1/2 kills and you should see it. it isn't rare. 42 kills and I still haven't seen them once.  I've seen 4 finkle skinners so far.
---
People will get bored once the novelty wears off, just like launch.
---
Some will quit or unsub, most will go back to gearing and raiding, and some will continue organized PVP, but much less than we currently have. 
---
Play an alt in a starter zone for a week and let it die down.
---
No need to rush out a phase early just because of the new phase hype.
---
He seems amicable enough on the discord, I've reported a few issues there and he's fixed them quickly. Besides I couldn't live without Tuk, it's like all the popular nameplate/unitframe/bag/tooltip addons mixed into one package.
---
" I said there is nothing for a lot of us 60s to spend gold on " 
---
"  I never claimed theres was nothing for any 60 to spend there gold on. "
---
Ok..
---
I think they need to implement free faction transfers if they are going to do this. However, that leaves the big issue of how to deal with shaman/paladin transfers. Simply ignoring them means that some guilds that decide to swap factions have to abandon all their paladin/shamans which is a no-go in my mind. 
---
I still think BGs will solve a lot of the current issues and might even help with faction imbalance if it ends up with horde having to wait 40+ minutes only to meet alliance premades in every BG they enter.
---
And sharding makes it easy to just hop into a winning layer. 9/10 shards alliance dominant, 1/10 shard Horde dominant with little to no mixing.
---
Nobody expected the faction balance to be this bad though. Some servers are nearing a 20/80 balance. A lot of people thought it would be like private server who always had a near 50/50 faction balance.
---
Yes, they badly need matchmaking for premade vs premade, or at least an mmr for win/loss so you would have the top solo player facing premade.
---
The big reason for raid bosses anyway is that 40 % of your white hits will be glancing blows which can't crit. If you heroic strike most mainhands and you stacked crit as is normal for max TPS you will get lots of crits you wouldn't normally get just auto sundering.
---
I like that he wants that, shows good values imo. But hope he realizes that will come in due time and to just relax and enjoy the freedom he has.
---
Lern2play?
---
I'm Horde on an Alliance dominated server but the difference is I was smart enough to deliberately chose a Medium pop one -- the size the world was designed for. If you rolled underdog faction on a High/Full pop realm, then that's your problem.
---
You can get all the honor you want, but what matters is your honor in relation to every other player in your faction on that server. You could get 1 mil honor this week, but you can't get more than 13k ranking points each week.
---
Why don't you go talk to your wife about it?
---
Your best bet is to ask on xpoff.com
---
However, it is common to just weapon swap from two hander with intellect enchant to one hander with agility enchant after becoming oom.
---
Do you have a source for that? As far as I've heard server population apps haven't worked correctly since September. I play Alliance on Benediction and it seems to me like the distribution is roughly equal
---
Man you really tried, I'll give you that
---
The trihards have ruined it like theyve ruined alot of things in classic
---
Go to booty bay right now you two

bis comment
---
This is awesome! Thanks for this post!
---
at that point make a macro to spam the macro that is the interact with target/buy item 31,1
---
It will definitely stay high but I have a feeling that at those prices it's currently better to start transmuting those Waters into Air and saving them for Phase 3. It wouldn't surprise me for Air to hit 35g+ on launch.
---
Precisely. I actually think it was intended to be flawed. Certain flaws bring players together. Getting camped by a player or few? Post in general chat and request help and maybe you'll make new friends. Having trouble with a quest that your class is at a disadvantage for so you'll get help from other players. World PvP being super unfair and there's a group of 5 or more of the other faction controlling the zone? The only way to do anything is to find people to work together.
---
But WoW does keep some fairness in mind. Battlegrounds is more fair since they are in level ranges and equal amount of players. That's why I played BGs the most in WotLK (the expansion that got me into WoW). I loved fair PvP and that's where I went. The only unfair part about it was people having better PvP gear and good players could get stomped by worse players with way better PvP gear.
---
Says the guy playing on a defacto pve server for Horde.
---
Stick it out man, it'll simmer down. People are just excited and it's the weekend.
---
I play Alliance on Sulfuras and aside from a few spots I'm not experiencing these massive packs of horde killing people so much that you can't farm or compete in the open world.
---
Yes there's more people and PvP around but there's nothing game breaking about it. I'm sure BRM and other popular hubs are a different story.

You shouldn't be judging how class matchups play out with such a small amount of health.

Why what’s up
---
As much as I've invested on my pvp server, you sum up exactly why I'm seriously considering starting fresh on a pve server to coast out the rest of my classic time without frustration. Our racials are near-useless in pvp so, just like in real Vanilla and BC, pvp servers end up Horde-heavy because everyone wants that edge, and PVE servers end up Alliance-heavy.
---
Glancing blow only happen to white hits, so it's irrelevant to Heroic strike. Enemy armor in boss fights should be 0 or close to 0 if you have the relevant debuffs on. But I agree that you need a lot of rage for HS spam to surpass sunder spam, and the loss of rage from losing the white hit might make it less efficient in non-raidboss situations where your generate a significant chunk of your rage from your white hits. However, I find that I often have plenty of rage to dump on heroic strikes when tanking raid bosses even in MC. 
---
Also. I'm finding it better to HS spam since I would rather use my actual GCDs on other stuff like, revenge, shield slam/bloodthirst, keeping up BS/demo etc.
---
It's when people don't understand the difference between PvP and Griefing that it gets annoying. 
---
Griefing is a bannable offence in most mmos, camping is lame asf.
---
Well right the horde has the ability to transfer servers for the most part due to population imbalance. I think it would be logical to have faction based queues thus incentivizing the majority faction to relocate. It’s blizzards fault for not putting some sort of cap per faction from the beginning.
---
I like that personally. Tanking purely being about damage mitigation is a thing that developed in retail as time went on and they slowly made threat irelevant.
---
Analogy is wrong I think. It's supposed to be "having your game and playing it too".
---
What is the fastest way to level a character to 60? First time doing this
---
Nope, auto loot by Default came with bc. You can still read this in wikis.
---
Before it was always Shift+click.
---
There were even addons for it, so there was no need for Shift click.
---
Yeah they're both excellent that guy is salty, ignore him ;)
---
My server has better balance than most but I feel for alliance on some of the others. Looking forward to the same horde going “hurr durr pvp on pvp server” pitching a fit when they’re the last ones to get AQ so I can tell them “damn, I guess the allies are too busy doing pvp on a pvp server to gather mats go back to retail”
---
This is very important!
---
Can Cho'Rush have different abilities depending on the run or am I just misremembering what someone said? And if so, what are they?
---
Against bosses shield block is up at all times.
---
You do realize premades can go against premades too? Every game won't be a stomp, I can also remember slapping premades around as a pug plenty of times. Your really overestimating the negative.
---
Wait what. Does it reveal stealthed players?
---
Tailoring is only worth it if you are going to do a few things after making your robe:
---
Making herb bags
---
Always using your moon cloth cd
---
Wanting the set bonus from Bloodvine (zg) for the 2%crit

Otherwise drop as soon as you have made robes and pick something else.
---
Pretty much the case for noggenfogger every evening since honor was released.

No, I'm playing Horde on classic actually

No tank consumables drop in dungeons yet tanks still run them. Buy your dark runes instead of demanding free gold from the group. Every mana class needs them.

---
I don’t think you can because you’re not understanding what that guy is saying
---
Done it many times, either solo players or zergs of 20 everywhere
---
whats the queue limit for av in classic?
---
i know in classic at the very least you can queue with 10 people for wsg.
---
Ive had to primarily make my own groups. Also getting ubrs key helps too
---
Yes my friend :D I tried to give people a chance who seemed like they waited on respawns
---
The trick (for my alt) was to make sure I stopped at 47. Now I'm gray to them, but can still join TM raids and snipe 60s with impunity.
---
Oh, duh - of course.  I'm a human.
---
The patch I played on originally you were able to use any spell when using mc, I remember they would also make me pop recklessness it was frustrating
---
Appreciate it, ty.
---
"What did it cost for 2 extra bank slots??......"
---
"......Everything..."
---
Not much of a market for those bags yet since they cost so much to make
---
&gt; why I shouldnt switch to a PvE server.
---
The main reason I stay is I like being able to contest farming points.
---
If I see an Alliance player going for a devilsaur or Black Lotus I want, I can force him to leave.
---
horde has stronger racials in both pve and pvp so most people pick horde
---
there’s a calculated 5^2(5x-2)^1 amount of possibilities the password could be and bassed off of your username id change that password yesterday
---
RIP Auzzy, btw
---
Arenas please!
---
Lmao
---
Yep https://ironforge.pro/servers/ Set it to show american servers and you'll see benediction
---
Would smack those thighs and say some evil shit about how she could be with asmon, so bad to be with that sleazy
---
Blizzard: We'll give horde lvl 60 elite guards for their cross continent travel points...and let's give alliance level 40 non elite for theirs. That should be about even.
---
can't even do dungeons very well on my server because no one wants to spent literally 30-45 minutes running to brd/brs
---
Hard rock closed, not rock bottom
---
.... U so sure? I had one bank alt ask for 6 of em so he can have max inventory space.
---
Have also crafted 8 of them this week alone. 
---
AND YES. Mooncloth has doubled on Skeram from 12g - 20+
---
The honorless target isn't currently functioning properly. They are getting honor from it.
---
Still waiting for mooncloth bags to reflect that new price lol, still hovering less than 20g or so.
---
I wont be playing outside of raids on my main server.
---
Let's be real, 15 years from now he's gonna be sitting in some VR MMO with full body haptic feedback bragging to his guildies about the time he got kidnapped by 40 people and wishing shit like that would happen in the game he's playing then.
---
2098 HKs / 571 DHKs
---
Low effort post. Go be salty somewhere else because your express dream PvP situation hasn't materialised in the first three days. Try a different zone, or try making a small hit man team and charge up the river.
---
The alliance in massive groups seems like an logical response to Horde gank squads. Just bigger groups to counter the big groups after single Allys. Not judging, just think it's an interesting turn around.
---
it wont last 6 min.. it will last roughly 10 minutes when premade. Speaking out of experience.
---
Diminishing returns didn't exist in classic
---
Why do people keep saying this? Vanilla was NEVER like this. As alliance the ENTIRE WORLD is camped
---
I get what you're saying, but 48+ is when it gets really rough because all the leveling zones are full of 60s taking advantage of an easy HK. Un goro is a fucking nightmare on my server (Whitemane)
---
As if this is some sort of catch-all defense against any criticism against Classic. 
---
But, I ***didn't*** expect the levels of stupidity that I've experienced. Getting camped by rogues all the way inside encampments, like Kargath. Getting killed and stalked by higher levels **non-stop**, for hours (or until I just log out). Getting steam rolled again, and again, and again by groups who just rove around killing anyone who's not in a raid. 
---
Yeah, okay, ya got me bud. I didn't expect any of this shit. Lol, this sentiment is so incredibly stupid, it's become funny.
---
That's something Blizz should consider releasing ASAP - add the world pvp objectives early to encourage pvp'ers to congregate in those zones.
---
I notice it's easier to stealth up to them if they notice you from a distance and wait, then back up and move around behind them again and attack. 
---
Just gotta advance cautiously to not enter combat when grabbing their attention.
---
Like others said, it gets easier with Distract.
---
That's surprisingly fair.
---
Oh I didnt know that, still it does have problems
---
When BGs come out, people are just going to complain about being farmed by premades instead.
---
I'm curious, how can hackers try thousands of passwords without triggering the temporary lock when u fail too much attempts ?
---
Similarly, friends with characters in their 50's Horde-side on Skeram are complaining about the same things.  Maybe they make it a hundred yards from the FP while you don't get three steps, but it's not a good time for anyone to be trying to open-world quest/level in those zones.
---
But I'm not on a server with my faction being more populated and I'm having fun even with pvp... because it's not a pvp server and I can toggle it. That's the point I'm making. Pvp servers are for a niche style that people like and it's not just "I like pvp" it's "I like the idea of having to look over my shoulder every 2 seconds". I don't get that because to me that sucks but to each their own. I do like pvp but I don't like having to constantly worry about being bothered.
---
If you're getting camped by a raid group, sometimes the spirit rez is the best option.
---
#nochanges amirite guyz?
---
Yup. And while leveling was fun once. I won't be doing it again.
---
bottom words
---
Heartseeker is in a weird place right now. I hate it as the dominate side too. I'd love to roam around with just 1-2 mates, but horde always band together in like 15 man groups, so they just roll over us normal small groups. So alliance form bigger groups to beat them, after a call out or two, next thing you know 60 alliance roll over these 15 horde for them to never be seen again. It's really not fun playing a constant cat an mouse all over the world anytime someone says the spotted a horde group. Really is 0 fun to be had. I've been saying for months that phase to risks killing classic as all these 1 sided servers the underdogs are going to be driven out of the game and the dominate side will have nothing to do either. Phase 5 should have been 2-3 months longer, and phase 2 should've only ever been planned for 1 month.
---
Saying all of that with the snide snarkiness you did just proves you were naive and really *didn't know* all of this would happen. This is exactly how it was going to go, and the veterans knew it too.
---
And you're getting ganked by those very same veterans. From your own comments I can tell you it sounds like should have rolled PvE, and just ran around deliberately flagged. Because you are a casual.
---
I know right!!! there is nothing else other than getting shit on right hahaha like those are the only two options in this complex game right!!! shit on or be shit on hahahahaha you are so right Domillomew thanks for your omnipotence
---
so basically level 60s have no advantage over level 40s because they effectively cannot kill them if they care about their rank?
---
 unironically, go to retail
---
lack of a goal hurts pvp.. never liked death match (arena) style.
---
40 v 40 in AV is a lot different than in Hillsbrad
---
This game has turned into pure cancer.
---
Closer to 30/70
---
Because it's slightly faster than Vis'kag making VK be the preferred MH.
---
I think they also planned on South Seas being one of the first expansions, so having this town be a bigger hub made sense. Also think they planned on doing something with zalashji's den down the way from the town.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
&gt;I don't want to play on a PvP server anymore.
---
This is like spending $400 on a model airplane, not reading the instruction manual on "How to fly a model airplane", then promptly crashing it and blaming the airplane. 
---
You didn't understand the consequences of something (rolling PvP) before you invested (time) into it, and are blaming it (the game) for being wrong.
---
I didn’t say no one can afford it, but there isn’t a steady stream of people willing to spend 500g on a bag
---
Blink is the same way.  Getting snagged up on every tiny little hill and fence post is just Vanilla.  Wouldn't be right to change it.
---
Framed as if youre in the bigger group when in reality probably a lone rogue that keeps getting found.
---
Oh no. You can’t say that. You’re going to get told that this is how PVP has always been and it’s your fault for being on a PVP server and to go reroll on PVE because you are a noob that’s just crying.
---
this makes zero sense, might as well buy food from vendors.. it doesn’t expire on logout and is way cheaper
---
Deep combat is the min-max leveling spec, but a subtlety/assassination build will save you time PVP-wise.
---
Which client did you use for this? I think I was only able to get the 0.7 version to correctly sandbox. Do you have a link? This is the kind of stuff I really enjoy doing. I love streaming videos showing people all the cool alpha/beta stuff that was left in the game at launch. I could talk all day about that stuff.
---
My dude doesn't know what a dead zone is.
---
Reading this made me dumber than I already am.
---
I was under the impression that other warriors were just lazy bastards, but then my guild got me to go Fury. Let be the first to say, fuck tanking as Fury man. 15% less threat than tanks and people are already attacking too much too fast when they DO have a proper tank.
---
No wonder no one wants to tank for these people. It's fucking horrible. If people knew how to play it wouldn't be an issue.
---
Exactly. This is what I’m saying too. But no this is how PVP has always been. You have people that have never even played Vanilla telling you that its always been this way and quit crying but as soon as they start to level an alt I bet they rage quit.
---
Interesting that until the honor patch, this channel was identical to localdefense and only alerted attacks in the zone you were currently in.
---
Do we know if BG’s will be realm locked or have battle groups yet? If they’re realm locked, they’re in for a rude awakening when they get 4 hour queues.
---
I played in vanilla and pre-made Battleground groups were not really that common. Or if they were many of them were not on any sort of voice chat. Back then there was no discord. 
---
Premade groups on voice comms should be fairly common these days.
---
Because the Alliance has better PvE racials (and Paladins) and they wanted world first Rag?
---
Hamster dance truly makes this feel like vanilla content
---
Spirit rezzing affects all gear on your character including in bags.
---
Because you took res sickness at the graveyard.
---
QQ
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
Just do yellow quests, mixed with occassional dungeon runs. Most classes level faster questing than just farming dungeons repeatedly. If you're a mage you can AoE farm, which is probably technically the fastest, but that takes some game-specific know-how.
---
These tryhards man, they really need to calm their tits
---
If you wanna be safe go to BRD and do prison runs and arena/general runs for a couple levels before doing full clears. Out in the world you could head to Un'Goro or Felwood. Between the two I'd guess Felwood is less populated,.
---
If that was done alliance would have no FP, vendors, or quest NPC within an hour.
---
Fucking lol
---
I actually did this once with three Warriors while on my own mage. Not that I think mages beating warriors is anything to brag about.
---
Lol if no one ever picks alliance how in the fuck do you get your PVP? Think about it.
---
Im unsure  about fade, but I know it can also happen to Feign Death for hunters.
---
Yeah it kinda sucks, I'm roaming and see a level 50, sorry dude but Blizzard said I have to kill you.
---
OY is this true!?!?!?! horde have 60 elite guards at there tvl points. damn your right they killed my ass omw to SM when i was lvl30's.... i never compared it hahahaha what a bunch of bullshit, aaahhhh makes the journey that much more sweet as alli though IMO
---
I'd go Ret and keep some Int gear and a Shield in bags. Be prepared to take on any of the three roles. Around 55 you can respec for tanking or healing to do the final push to 60.
---
Yes they can. Just need to swap out some gear.
---
And you know... give consent.
---
It's a tool. It can't tell you what rank to use in a given situation, only how much mana it uses vs. healing done.
---
It's saying, here, this is the gear that gets the best gas mileage. It's not telling you how fast to drive or where to go.
---
I’m crying and whining? I said it’s lame. You’re being a little sensitive.
---
Honestly the best Wpvp I've had is on my alt.  Organic 1v1s with real shit on the line (gotta get that escort).  All I've done on my 60 is zerg or get zerg'd
---
I found the videos on it. Very interesting, thanks/
---
I took your comment as if you meant to choose the other faction. It sounds like you were trying to say that it’s balanced well and the other faction just sucks. I probably read it wrong.
---
and they got hk’s for every single one of them.
---
No I like boob shoulders, just look at Nightslayer! But those shoulders... they bother me.
---
REEEEEE NO ONE CAN BE GOOD ONLY OTHERS CAN BE BAD REEEEEEE
---
His classes are priest/mage/shaman
---
Someone posted yesterday he does have diff abilities. Can be a mage, shaman, or priest I think they said?
---
Gehennas EU
---
I focus on being my class and build. You keep focusing on being a dick
---
That’s embarrassing
---
They never once said 6months per phase....
---
Rage harder
---
That’s me! Dump 100+ items on the AH, 33% off! SELL SELL SELL!!!
---
It was up until about cata, when it really started to shift. Apparently panda is when it flipped to more horde players.
---
I  played horde back then, I'm playing alliance in classic. Instant pop bg queues will be fun.
---
It's not 80% anymore. We're easily into the 70:30 territory right now. With another 4-7 solid horde guilds transferring in, we'd be at 60:40 and sitting pretty.
---
This
---
LOL wtf
---
So you'd punish them because you didn't get what you wanted? Talk about a trash player.
---
Pretty much never need it in raids, but yeah it's as you say in pvp. Some people put their back up against a wall and you can't backstab, and sometimes in really close fights I'll finish them off with SS when I would've died if I waited for backstab. It can also be nice for solo farming mobs in some situations.
---
&gt; This is like spending $400 on a model airplane, not reading the instruction manual on "How to fly a model airplane", then promptly crashing it and blaming the airplane. 
---
This analogy is so stupid, it's nearly unbelievable that you came up with it. First of all, I didn't spend 400$, but nice try in trying to inflate the value of the decision. Second, there is no "instruction manual" that describes in detail how atrocious this WPvP would be, so this part is void. Third, I never blamed anyone.... I simply want a transfer, because I don't like PvP servers anymore. None of your analogy works, whatsoever, because.... you're an idiot. 
---
&gt;You didn't understand the consequences of something (rolling PvP) before you invested (time) into it, and are blaming it (the game) for being in the wrong.
---
First of all, putting parentheses around random words is nonsensical and unnecessary. Second, and I don't know how many times I need to say this (probably a couple more, because you cant seem to comprehend things that people say (btw, this is how you use parentheses)), ***but I already admitted I didn't know the consequences of rolling on PvP server!*** Jesus fucking Christ, the American education system is FUCKED.
---
i love classic but i am really amped for tbc, i hope they end up releasing it. i would love to relive my arena glory days
---
Previously Made (or formed) groups that queue together. They are typically working together in comma and have set roles whereas randomizes groups don’t have that advantage.
---
Ikr at first I thought it was a painting but then the banana brought me back to reality.
---
No sword and board, new to 60, just starting with Fury. I am just frustrated with some folks assuming because I'm 60, and a warrior that I am tank specded. Loved tanking in Vanilla, didn't know this side of Warrior build :)
---
&gt;As far as I am aware very few 60s go out of their way to kill 47&gt; players unless they deserved it (cheeky gnomes are an exception).
---
Lol....you're either being intentionally blind to it or you're flat out lying.
---
Yeah I do this all the time (hey I'm a rogue, it's what we do) and it works as long as you wait like 30 seconds.
---
But have you tried retail?
---
pVp HaPpEnEd PvP sErVeR
---
What class are you?
---
Warlocks for example need 300 tailoring for BiS gear in ZG.
---
its extremely fun 1% of the time and mind numbingly tedious and borderline insulting the other 99% of the time
---
This would maybe have had an impact at the beginning of classic launch, but I think it's too late for this now. Very few with a 60 would be willing to reroll.
---
You'll have to pickup tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus, but it's easy to relevel tailoring
---
oh man i love turning in the prereqs for my warlock epic mount in burning steppes....  just to be camped by 5 rogues and a mind control to make me lose honorless target
---
horde camped brm for weeks on blaumeux prior to p2
---
As a priest with 300 tailoring who just made his true faith, is it worth dropping tailoring for herbalism or is there anything coming out in the phases that I should save it for?
---
Idk about when to swap out, but I’m very confident you want to buy robes of winter night from the auction house (~100g) for your chest.
---
Other games do a priority queue, so premades get matched with premades first, then pugs get matched with pugs, and only the "extras" get matched with eachother.
---
... what did you expect?
---
Population doesnt mean dominance... Its stv... Buncha 60s can wreck a lvl 30ish zone
---
Maybe in retail. But a fresh 60 Fury Warrior with 2 Green lvl 50 swords, and no level 60 dungeon gear,may not be the best assumption for tanking you and your level 55 friends through UBRS
---
Yes. Very common practice to walk people off the ships so they have to swim for ages.
---
There are leveling guides that can put you in zones with the most quest turn ins. Joana’s is great but had a paywall.
---
Your class is a tank class. You can tank in any spec. You can tank while dual wielding. You can tank with a two hander. 
---
You do not focus on your class and build, because you clearly dont know it.
---
Oof, Im hurt.
---
&gt;I’m not complaining.
---
*Entire post is complaining.*
---
I would honestly re-roll on a PvE server or quit. I think you, like many others, didn't fully comprehend what they were getting themselves into on a PvP server.
---
What I liked about large scale PvP was Spy telling me about all the bastards who killed me in front of dungeons and similar. This way I could target them specifically and would murder them.
---
&gt; All of the veterans knew what was going to happen.
---
Clearly you are not a veteran.  This is nothing like vanilla.  Nothing remotely similar.  Vanilla had a fraction of the server population.
---
You can tank dungeons at level 60 after doing 3-4 quests for base gear.
---
It really is not a hard task. You don't need secondary gear. You can tank perfectly fine without anything from raids.
---
No, vanilla was never like this because vanilla had reasonable server populations.
---
Just make them unkillable.
---
I’m still leveling got from 52 to 55 since Thursday, do I get tanked a lot? Yes I’ve died more in those 2 levels than I have in all of 1 to 53. Do I bitched and cry about it... yea I do a lot actually but you know what I Rez and get back out there and get those damn levels. Ganking is still gonna be happening it just won’t be a shit ton of 60 just a few bad ones looking for easy kills and mostly player around your leveling trying to gank. Roll PVE if you didn’t want this then why did you roll PVP
---
I usually tip accordingly to how the mage behaves pretty much, although i always have a minimum of 2 g.
---
If i write: Wtb mage water in /2 chat, and someone invites me, but just stands still waiting for me to come, or just gives 20-40 water, he gets 2 g.
---
I don’t wanna reward the guy to much, but atleast he took the time to answer/invite.
---
If the mage in question comes to me (If i’m in SW, and he’s in IF, but ports) i usually tip 5-10 g for his effort.
---
I tipped a mage 20 once, he ported from SW to IF for me, made water (so i opened trade chat).
---
He said: Not yet, only got 60 (or 80, can’t remember), uses evocation, and makes more, and hands me a full stack, while asking If that’s enough or If i need more.
---
If you put more effort in it, i will reward you accordingly :)
---
I havent solidly tested it yet Im working on how bad it is, but it puts a huge warning on your screen when anyone in combat log range (larger than your vision range) goes stealth, it reads any action in combat log and gets any info about the player that it can  
---
So the only way to effectively stealth to someone is to be halfway across the map, go stealth, and do LITERALLY NOTHING except move, until you jump someone, at which point you show up on everyone's spy as appearing and they will kill you
---
Go to a balanced sever you damn nitwit. You people are like an abused spouse. You get your teeth kicked in, complain and when someone tells you a reasonable solution you ignore it. Do you think blizzard gives a flying hoot about this sub? Go scream into the air and tell god to smite you, let me know the results.
---
xD I do this sometimes. I just wanna get that shit sold. I get literal hundreds of items send back from the auction house every day. I don't want to spend 30 minutes every day to try to sell my shit.
---
Well at least we know to ignore all of your opinions because you put lawbringer as a C.
---
His parents trained him 12 hours a day to do this
---
Mirahs song too. 
---
Imagine expecting to be carried in dungeons that fucking hard.
---
you don’t have the honorless buff when you res. only in/out instance and flightpath
---
This is a problem exclusive to PvP servers.  If you chose to roll on a PvP server, and don't enjoy PvP, that's your fault, transfer off or reroll someplace you'll enjoy yourself.
---
Wow, because of your post allies started enjoying the game. 
---
Thank you !
---
Dps warriors, remember to never tank and roll on everything
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dwfht2/we_got_tag_on_azuregos_after_another_raid_wiped/
---
They won't get banned, it's best to just wait until paid transfer or just quit until battlegrounds. Whichever is first.
---
But, fp, boat, instance entrance camping will always exist. After bg it'll just be smaller.
---
What do I care?  I'll be playing BG's with instant queues, which is the only reason I play vanilla WOW anyways, BG's.  I guess I feel bad for the poor casual quester out there who isn't 60 yet, but whatever.
---
You should feel bad for not holding through that. No DPS should be able to pull threat off of you *single target*. AoE is a different story, but if I had to take a guess, I'd guess that you're still trying to play protection in dungeons (god forbid you're playing fury prot in dungeons). Even in dungeons, if you play the correct spec (arms), you will be able to hold threat on priority targets and generate sufficient threat on non-priority targets such that they die before your DPS do.
---
Same, does anyone know a well populated horde PvE server?
---
horde willingly take an X v X battle? yeah okay
---
ElvUI
---
or the alts, raiders who use consumable, pvp players who farm grenade mats, etc
---
My tip is massive, and im a hunter
---
i remember your thread, i forgot /s    but did you put in a bug report yet?
---
Yh.. unless you're doing 20 or 25 man MC, I heavily doubt your dps and healers are that bad you need so many consumes
---
&gt;Gamer toxicity has also changed. There were assholes on the internet in 2005, but Twitch and Youtube pushed the idea of being an asshole past the point of taboo.
---
I think it's more that wow was the babby game back then. UO,  D2, dota 1, hon were all 100 times more "toxic" than anything i see in classic.
---
For your idea to make sense would mean you'd need the average alliance be better than average horde. It's not a realistic expectation to have. Assuming equivalent level of players, alliance is fucked. Im proud of your buddies but horde also has folks pwning people like you do.
---
Statistically speaking, at this scale (the world), it's a numbers game and elite squads here and there aren't representative of anything.
---
crazy of you to use the similarly strong t1 boots instead of omni.
---
People were asses back then, yeah, but they were fewer in number and generally known. 
---
The gaming community was MUCH smaller than it is today, so people were closer and generally more helpful. 
---
I used to play Ragnarok Online and spent 9/10ths of my play time sitting outside towns BSing with other players for *hours*. Even Runescape (I'm talking OG, before it got that 3D update - back when there were no animations and everything was displayed as a bubble above our heads) had a small but well known community. There were mean people, but it is NOTHING like today.
---
I'm so used to not using it that I'm usually halfway done with a dungeon before I realise that we have no warrior and I could actually be using it for once haha. Just so used to always having sunder armor on stuff.
---
Wpvp is shit. They need to release atleast wsg.
---
This is coming from a geared hunter. 
---
Wpvp is boring as fuck
---
Yeah, BWL is going to be a rude awakening for some people.
---
In my guild, we're seeing healers get benched for putting up poor numbers on the heal meter. They're losing out to people who are spamming flash heal, racing each other to top off the life-tapping warlock.

The text is in german, thats why I didn't post it at first. But I give a translation to the options.
---
&gt;"Ansonsten gibt es momentan leider nur folgende Möglichkeiten:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;\- Immer in einer Gruppe reisen damit man sich besser wehren kann  
---
&gt;\- Abwarten und hoffen, dass sich die Situation nach der ersten Euphorie wieder beruhigt  
---
&gt;\- den kostenlosen Servertransfer in Anspruch nehmen."
---
&gt;Otherwise there are currently only this options:  
---
&gt;\- Always travel in a group for better defense  
---
&gt;\- Wait and hope that the situation gets better after the first euphoria  
---
&gt;\- Make use of the free server transfer 
---
The first 2 suggestions, okay. Useless, especially the first one with our current server situation, where a group will be wiped out at the flightmaster on landing. But making the server situation even worse for the sake of lower queues..
---
I've got herblore and skinning. Which one should I drop for engineering? I'm leaning towards dropping skinning because I feel like there is more opportunity to make gold from herblore. Pots will always be valuable but gear produced from leatherworking will drop in demand as people get geared. Thats my thought process anyway.
---
Someone that knows basic economics should know that the price of essences will increase with inflation and you'll still be making the same percentage of profit.
---
So glad I went for a PvE server. I PvP when I want and had some nice encounters vs Allys. Can't see myself play on a PvP server, seems like a shit show.
---
Do you go around the border or actually into the caves?
---
&gt;I watches a video of a guy who spent/invested 25k gold in mats that will all go up in value
---
Cool. So did thousands of others and the market will be flooded with hoarded items resulting in it all being worthless.
---
they do lol... they just dont wpvp...
---
&gt;  I can also remember slapping premades around as a pug plenty of times 
---
If there is one thing Classic's re-release has shown us, its that things that happened in the past are not a good indicator of how they will play out today.
---
Almost all my fights are duels. Around the world. Hence World Pvp.

I'm not the one talking about essences here
---
then your server is probably dead.
---
Nah I'm enjoying it. Alliance on dreadmist
---
I find it incredibly odd that horde on wow has become an outlet for so many people with crippling personality disorders... Like of all places for those people to congregate
---
Bloodmail boots are pre-raid bis... I can't tell if you know this and are being sarcastic or don't have a clue.
---
Kthxbai

The German version uses the metric system. The numbers don't change btw. it is all still the same. The only difference being it now saying meters instead of yards.
---
Transfer to where? At the moment alliance players aren't even allowed to transfer off servers because they're working on faction balance with horde.
---
Anyone with a triple digit IQ knew that blizz was fucking up phase 2.
---
Private servers have original AV and it was still rush fests. People want their rep, not to sit in 10 hour turtles.
---
Its okay to be a trash player.
---
You can have both at the same time.
---
your raid must be total shit
---
What potions use essence of water?
---
Of course, but they do this on retail now too. Situations in which you deserve loot for the work you did, but undermined by a bug get met with "its a bug, deal with it"
---
I mean is this really the kind of behavior we want to say is acceptable in something we pay continuously for? At a certain point they need to be held accountable and held to higher standards instead of this worsening state of interaction.
---
As someone who grew up playing MMOs in '99-'03: yes
---
I've played text based MUDs, I played the original runescape, Anarchy Online, EQ, Ragnarok, WoW... I can tell you things have changed. 
---
People are considerably more rude today. Streaming and lets play things have made being mean cool, and an entire generation of gamers has learned mistaken being mean for being smart
---
Mate be happy.. that's the highest achievement you're ever going to see in your life.
---
Its the most Horde-like thing to do.
---
Be real.
---
There is no way to recover anything sold on the AH. All sales are final. Mistakes in posting really suck :( 
---
My condolences.
---
Ok did anyone need this?  This is every pugs strategy
---
and a GCD
---
Damn, guess I learned an expensive lesson :(
---
Thanks for the reply
---
If It has already been purchased by another player , theres nothing you can do. Let this be a lesson to double check everything that you do.  Costly mistakes . You could message the player and tell them you accidentally sold it that low , but good luck getting them to fork it over.   Better luck next time
---
Nope, that sucks but just be glad u didn’t do it with an epic or something. If you’re not level 60 yet I understand if you think a 30g loss is tough but it’s not too bad. You’ll be fine chief keep your head up and get back to the grind!
---
Even with cross realm BGs, queues can still take a while. Plenty of time to get some ganks done.
---
So what's the logic behind a lv 45 ganking a lv 28? Just to make someone else's day shittier?
---
&gt; ...kill **the level 57 farming satyrs**
---
He's talking about killing players, not satyrs.
---
I don't think you understand what good is.
---
I’m capped, the dominant faction on my server, and have been ganked maybe twice these last few days, and I still think it was incredibly stupid.
---
4-7 that would never have a good reason to take that chance. They know how shit it is being horribly outnumbered lol
---
you probably cant have a real 1v1 with a warrior anyways.
---
It is massively toxic, and unlikely to improve.
---
There are other factors to be sure. I was only talking about why it looks weird when you cross into a new zone.
---
Its possible. I said it doesn't universally apply. You can't take extremes of a bell curve and apply it to everyone. We're talking about the average ally vs average horde, not the awesome pros melting faces of a group twice their size. 
---
Your anecdote cannot be universally applied.
---
bucket shitters.
---
&gt; How on earth can you possibly say int is generally just as good as +healing?
---
Because of the math this entire post explains. You have to get to some pretty in-combat mana (over 15k) before int falls below the 1:1 threshold, and that's still generally for the most +Healing weighted spells. Perhaps when fights get longer and the game more revolves around regen, the total in-combat mana will balloon enough to make int irrelevant. With my current spell profile and mana usage in combat though, int is still pretty comparable (1.4-ish).
---
5v1 is just as unfair as 20v5 just so you know
---
The population being more than it was in original wow is the source of most of the issue.  I played on Arthas as a priest and Illidan as a shaman.   It was never this massively terrible.  I'd die frequently, there might be a raid killing people, but right now there are literally lines of horde groups from a flight path to instance portal.  Even going to scholomance there are 3+ gank parties from Chillwind before even arriving to Caer Darrow, and 15 people standing outside the instance with 20 totems just farming people.  I'm sure there's plenty of people playing on servers that are lower population, but it's a nightmare on any high pop ones.  This is Blizzard's screwup.   It's entirely on them, and it's also on them to do something about it, soon, before the underdogs that are getting absolutely floored decide they're just done.
---
What did you expect for a game that existed for 15 years and players studied it in private servers for years? I am pretty happy to know the game well. That spares me of the struggles i had back then, gets me loot and gold much much faster. I rerolled to Alliance 2 weeks ago and take my time leveling. Because i know exactly i will not have any problems once i reach lvl60. This is not a race for me anymore. The race is over by now. It was fun though when the servers were fresh and you could be under the top players of lvling and clearing raids. I'm not much into pvp so the honor system without battlegrounds is not for me.
---
Pretty new to the game, but why does it matter that he has hand of rag?
---
Nothing puts hair on your chest like spamming aoe and afking in the back for honor.
---
The only skill you’ll see in wpvp like this is healers who don’t have the benefit of alt tabbing and collecting honor without someone noticing.
---
&gt; It doesn’t auto detect them, they have to be unstealthed and use an ability that shows up in the combat log.
---
=
---
I'm pretty sure that if then run into range with literally any buffs on (e.g. mount or power word shield) then they will get detected.
---
Hard to introduce, since lowbies could just walk in to die as a tactic to  prevent raids from engaging. A raid with lowbies sitting inside to prevent any class from casting aoes would make bigger clashes very punishing or boring. Everyone would be on their toes so they won't lose honor. I wouldn't want this big clashes to leave the server, I just want them to be at fair sizes or at least in honorable ways that doesn't involve hourlong corpse or citysite camping. Lowies can also be very destructive in higher level pvp, if the assist their friends. Not be able to defend yourself against them would also strongly benefit people with low level player in groups. 
---
They should just punish people that actively try to prevent player from playing the game for no benefit other than ruining other peoples experience. But that's also something that's not too important for me. My focus with the post was how GMs give the advise to flee to another server to be save from the overwhelming majority of the opposite faction, because they can't find better ways to reduce queues.
---
no changes
---
Yeah, you're a scrub. 
---
You can't accept the consequences of the choice you made, crymor.jpg
---
That was the whole point of my comment.
---
I rolled a rogue on a pvp server in classic and I didn’t do it to gank. I did it to be able to farm easier with stealth, and to be able to escape a little easier from ganks. There are other reasons to play a rouge then being a dick.
---
There was no title for this
---
No one has anything to do? 
---
This is how the game was fifteen years ago. We all talked to eachother, explored, leveled alts, and raised professions.
---
Go full fire. Hella damage in Molten Core.
---
For the Horde!!!
---
I see, since im mainly dungeon grinding im running crippling offhand and instant or mind numbing mainhand (if no wf totems around) it wouldn't hurt to replace vanquishers with thrash for the time being and extra dps I assume
---
That's the only solution, yes.
---
I love Bloodsail Buccaneers.
---
Can you explain herb bags? How does that work?
---
Oh wow. I downloaded this a few days ago and I swear it said it was on the to do list. Has it just come out?
---
agreed..ugly af.
---
just do combat. without top gear your ambush isnt worth a shit anyways, and your hemo will suck as well because more than likely youll be using some crap weapon 7 levels below you.
---
combat swords is good enough to kill anyone your level, and if someone way above you ganks you youre fucked from the beginning. plus your stealth bonus wont save you from a high level either.
---
Thanks!!  It's super deceiving because when you click on WoW Classic, there's a try free button &amp; I went through all the steps.  Agh!
---
Are there practice dummies in classic? I want to practice my dps rotation
---
Or level alts until phase 3
---
I’m pretty sure things like this aren’t against any kind of terms or rules. It’s more of “at the players own risk” kinda thing.
---
Face pulling causes you to pull them unlinked because you're technically pulling them separately, but simultaneously. If you pull them with an attack, you will aggro whichever one got attacked, and then the other one will aggro because his partner got aggroed, rather than because he did.
---
Why are you talking like a prick?
---
Champ, move on.
---
I actually like Open World PvP a lot. Back then, when BGs were introduced, southshore vs tarrens mill vanished.
---
No one interested in PvP should miss this out, it is just a big part of the original classic experience.
---
NOP, don't think anything would happen. He didn't break any rules and even if he did I personally don't think blizzard would do something involving 1G.
---
Kind regards
---
From your terribly unsubtle post I'm guessing you're one of the rogues who I've insulted? Lol
---
No, you'll be fine. The people bitching and moaning on reddit don't have any concept of how to adapt their play to the situation. Even as alliance on an imbalanced server you will be able to find a guild, find a group, and grind dungeons to 60.
---
why are there no bars, keybinds, stat numbers
---
No
---
Skinning is garbage
---
What does x equal
---
anyone worth their salt will laugh at you for going sf that early, that's all that matters
---
What class?
---
That sounds horrible.
---
If it won't do anything I don't want to waste my time even writing a report lol 
---
I've already moved on this was hours ago I was just curious if what he said was true.
---
Nah I'm pretty sure it's the 10:1 odds that prevent world pvp from being fun.
---
P2 ur tank goes gets 3-4 whelps for rage and follow onyxia around spamming revenges
---
better to sound like one that actually be one. pretty sure thats how comedians get their line of work.
---
Logs pls.
---
The mistake was having server populations larger than what the game was designed for.
---
It is not only racials. Horde can level until like 25 in Barrens which is a pvp off zone. Meanwhile allaince have a contested zone from 15 near MC (redridge) and only can level until 20 in other non contested zones.
---
Horde then can lvl to 44 in sm and rfd and rfk. Alliance however does not have easy access for SM. In the first 44 levels alliance is more fucked.
---
Yesterday I was running around on both continents for like 3 hours to find some 1v1s or 1v2s. All I found were large raids, 5-10 men grps &amp; several groups of 3-5 rogues corpse camping. Daaaamn that was so much fuuun.
---
Maybe, but not honor.
---
I figured as much
---
Yep. I do my own theorycrafting and use the add-on Pawn.
---
I have a pure dps scale set up based on raid theorycrafting. I also have a PvP scale set up which values stamina and intellect a lot more highly. And then I have a combined scale.
---
Often the green shadow wrath items are 5% better for pure dps but is 30-50% worse for the combined scale.
---
I suspect after a week or two people will go back to doing other things
---
Only to find out a druid was the first to post it.
---
20k population vs 4k population hmm
---
Saw a player on my server with your exact name this afternoon camping some low level place for hours. Wetlands maybe. Something like that. I know for a fact it WASNT any “put some hair on your chest” “men from the boys” style pvp.
---
Prestige? On server where everybody knows you can have no wPvP, because your faction outnumber opponents 4v1 so you would fall behind on honor? When you would enter BGs everybody would have rank 10+ except guys from your "Prestige" server.
---
damn straight.
---
Typical alliance whine thread and I thought it was bad on the official forums.
---
hey maybe you should go outside
---
14 holy for consecrate/healing light then 14 prot for kangs/improved RF
---
Something similar yes, looks like they changed it.
---
edgy try hards
---
level 5 warrior. Gotta rehotkey all those autoattacks
---
That’s insane, congratulations lol
---
Nah can’t be that, can’t be the zerg mentality of roaming zones with groups of 10-20 people, must be the DHKs that loterally do nothing this reset, obviously.
---
I have to agree. I love the occasional 1v1 fights but right now, as I'm still a bit shy of level 60, I can't do any quests at all because I get camped as soon as I leave a town.
---
Funny, I'm on Skeram and I don't see horde anywhere, just alliance in massive 40+ man raids AoEing everything down in seconds.   Can't go anywhere without an alliance ganking squad finding me and killing me instantly, no horde in sight.   Feel the horde response has been pretty pathetic honestly, we should be forming up to wipe these raids out.
---
I mean if I find the right guild that starts raids a bit later, then sure! Right now I haven't found one with such conditions. I can play for large chunks of time, those chunks are just hard to commit to a certain timeframe.
---
You really think it’s possible to level a new char now? Up untill level 20 maybe, once you step into a contested zone it’s over. For alliance that is.
---
With all the transfers going on on top of everything else I'm sure it's a logistical nightmare making sure these things happen seamless, that being said I'm sorry you can't get to the server sooner
---
Here, [this game](https://kids.poki.com/en/g/my-little-pony-princess-luna-dress-up) might be more up your alley. It's not as fierce when it comes to consequences.
---
I have my crafts in my TRP profile. My professio *is* my RP.
---
Dude you rolled rogue on pvp server, the number one ganking class and complaining.
---
*dies in warlock*
---
Alliance are trash
---
Rank 14
---
They were cross realm in 1.12
---
Lvl an alt on pve server.
---
How many kills would it take to hit rank 3? A few hundred?
---
yeah It was a humblebrag, but 70g holy shit I don't even make that in a year!
---
That could be a reason but it really isnt it.
---
MMO culture has changed to be a efficiency machine.
---
post on your server sub forum on the official blizz forums
---
Doing it globally for pvp realms would only make a couple of alliance only realm and every other are horde realm with queues. Or globally for all realms? Then alliance on pve, horde on pvp just like now.
---
It's a videogame. 
---
Are you having fun? If so continue. If not quit. 
---
You don't need our approval for these decisions.
---
What. How do you not make 70 gold in a whole year?
---
Sf in late bwl / aq is only 15-20% less damage then combat daggers and its even closer on some fights. Is good in the sense it still beats most classes and is fun.
---
If you're needing those tools to beat someone more than 10 levels below you then I think that's pretty lame
---
How do you even play Frost Mage wrong...?
---
Was he casting Arcane Missiles or something?
---
139 arena/angers with 1 SGC I lost to a 56, and haven't won HOJ yet.
---
Bunnings Warehouse? Damn I miss you guys
---
Lost my first sgc on run 116 to a lvl56
---
Solve for it.
---
they changed it to 10  4/5 years ago
---
That’s pretty fucked up pal
---
&gt; Lizzard needs to figure a solution out and fast
---
They figured it out 15 years ago. It is called pve servers. I play there too because I did not want to be corpse camped.
---
All he did was cast Frostbolt. Never any Air when he should have, just single target dps frostbolting. "Hey, can I get some waters/food off you real quick." "Nah, takes too much time." I mean, in general, he was just an asshat.
---
No its fine if I'm 15
---
Well the reason is because rather than creating a guild, I want to make the equivalent of checking a box in settings that says ‘block annoying guild invite whispers’. If I have people talking in guild chat then it wouldn’t really be what I was advertising when having my charter signed.
---
Like I was saying in my op, some ppl just don’t want to worry about choosing a guild early—especially when it’s your first char.
---
And I wouldn’t say that t he y are rare messages, they are like vultures l. I get them more than gold sellers. They’re always these long ass messages, and I don’t know, they just bother me. Gold sellers bother a lot of ppl it seems, so having longer messages more often is even more annoying. Ya feel me?
---
&gt; Alliance are either in massive groups or
---
Look. I play Horde. I love PVP. The answer isn't "dont PVP as Horde". Rather the above is the answer. Hunt us down and kill us like the dogs you think we are.
---
That's because you were bad at the game back then and never saw the top end. You can continue to be bad at the game in 2019, but there's no reason to force others to do so.
---
Oh look this thread again
---
Rogues, remember to apply slows and bleeds on warriors then kite them out of melee/charge range while they die.
---
LMAO, how did you even know this game exists? Yikes, dog. Yikes.
---
havent been on reddit lately.  people been complaining?
---
I really don’t think we’ll see BWL until late February or March, tbh. I know that Rag is farm status for most guilds but man, January is like 8 lock outs away.
---
0.5.3 is the most interesting by far, it is the last closed alpha client with early developement and really different stuff than the live game, all the more recent versions aren't as interesting they're "cleaned"
---
but wait some APES cocksucking fanboy just told me TODAY that they were the best!
---
People who complain that others are too easily offended are usually just people who behave in offensive ways.
---
There wouldn't be queues for BGs if it is popular.
---
Well same day i contancted blizz. Got all Item back :) and I did a brd emp run. Ofc i got Iron for aswell :) Nice ending
---
Mograinne is not as bad as other places but I for sure think the horde control more areas
---
The back and forth from TM/tower/Southshore can get a bit same-y after a while but I really enjoyed it the other day, and that’s as a completely underpowered rogue.    
---
It’s obviously far more fun when you’re winning too.
---
As a alliance member of stalagg , I feel this hard
---
And everyone who doesn't play PvP loves to pretend this is what happens 90% of the time.  In reality it is very rare.
---
Ahh haven't tried that! Might be much easier! Thanks
---
really because it looks like you tried to gank him at 20% mana and took 3 minutes to do it, im waiting for your next video of you beating up people in comas at the ICU
---
what a fucking moron.
---
My thing is, I'm not playing classic to be some try hard overused blanket. I'm playing because I had so much fun in Vanilla, that is, until two days ago. It's nice not having everything given to you right now.
---
Want a group for a dungeon? Start slutting yourself out in/trade or /LFG. You can't just hit a button.
---
Here's some talent points, don't fuck 'em up because it gets expensive real quick.
---
This gear does this, and that legendary requires Work and cooperation with others to get.
---
It's so much more than nostalgia at this point, and I'm seriously enjoying playing the game that got me into this mess the way it was when i started.
---
Tukui
---
DB is ok IF you wanna cap. (not needed untill p3)
---
Tanked and cleared whole mc with valor as a prot warrior
---
frost mage lmao. downvoted. nothing personnel kid
---
I’m wondering if an employee needs to recreate your character manually. Either way, that’s unfortunate.
---
No problem
---
but there's literally hotkeys there. Unless you mean the backpack, he might have unbound that
---
Why should I get punished for blizzards fuckup?
---
While you definitely can optimize how to level your warrior mathematically, there's not much else beyond fighting numbers. Some people are into just that, but it's definitely the toughest class to learn leveling on.
---
You'll have a marvelous time afterwards tho, using warr as your steppingstone so to speak
---
Yeah for about 10min. Then you realize you're not actually doing anything and getting no honor.
---
I hear that. “Hey man, did you know you could save 15 seconds leveling 1-10 by skipping xyz quest?”
---
Going out of your way to PvP whilst leveling is just dumb. Yeah PvP is fun, but SUPER unbalanced pre 60. And not to mention the fact that 5 minutes after said fight you're gonna be corpsecamped by 60s
---
Hey it's one of the guys from the post! What's it like being a meme irl?
---
Tarren mill vs southshore has always been a shitshow
---
"Mimimi, I am on a totally horde dominated server, where we steamroll alliance 24/7 due to sheer mass. Dishonorable kills are super lame, because there is a 1% area where I cannot ruin other people's fun without penalties. While we are at it why cannot we remove alliance only zones? I mean it is a PvP-Server and I also want to try out an 1 vs 1 in Elwynn to prove my super boomer skills."
---
That moment when you get your shoulder pads is the best feeling.
---
Back in vanilla I used to run to the auction house right when I hit level 20 :D
---
yeah the default binds you bozo
---
So you lost durability and he didn’t
---
You are right - the part that bums me out is the class fantasy of a big immovable object style tank that is lost in the process.
---
As far as engaging gameplay, you are absolutely correct that threat management is and should be a major player in it, and if someone doesn't like that, then classic tanking is probably not for them, because its only gonna get worse as dps gets better gear and you need to push your threat even higher.
---
hahaha this reply is godlike matterial😂
---
Implying that any of the classes require skill 😂
---
it isnt based off the combat log, thats what people think tracks it lol
---
We don't know how the queue system will work?
---
HAHAHAHA! What? I tried questing there yesterday. It was me and another ally against 8 hordes. Just leaving the gates of nethergarde keep.
---
I love how this table makes it look easy to rank up (not OP's fault). I'm sure most people serious about PvP know this, but this assumes that one actually manages to rank as intended, relative to the rest of the server. That's a strong assumption.
---
In today's world I wouldn't be surprised if R14 remained reserved for roommates. Getting to R10 will already require crazy amounts of playtime since a lot more people willl try to get there. At the same time you won't be able to collude effectively around those ranks.
---
This system will break players. There will be a lot of tears once average Joe realizes he'll never be a Marshal. My popcorn is ready.
---
havent been on reddit for a while sorry dawg
---
Dang if only you didn't aggro the dog F
---
In case nobody else does I am acknowledging and giving you kudos for this futurama reference
---
Exactly this. Thank you.
---
Found the ignorant horde player that thinks imbalance is fake.
---
Found this on an extended scroll; not being a wow player but sensing shenanigans, what happened here?
---
Been consistently in the highest tier since the beginning.
---
He is an NPC
---
that's what I said from the beginning, don't get me wrong I still enjoy vanilla, but everyone knows the best build, the best gear the best everything. It's never going to be like it was in 2004.
---
No I think its stupid because i keep getting corpsecamped by ganksquads when im trying to level at 50
---
Your a salty little crybaby bitch lol. Seeing these types of replies makes me so happy i corpse camp people like you
---
You make some good points but I still stand by my point. People signed up to play on a PvP server. It sucks that it hasn’t gone their way. Faction imbalances suck. Being corpse camped sucks. But that is the reality of the game. If you look into any of the videos  with detailed breakdowns of the WoW phases or other people’s projections most say world PvP is going to be crazy including things like killed flight master, kills on landing, corpse camping etc during phase 2. It was to be expected without the release of battlegrounds at the same time as the honor system, but they are following the phase breakdown of vanilla. In vanilla the honor system was released before battlegrounds.  It sucks that people have sunk a lot of time into their characters and feel they can’t do anything. They didn’t know what they were getting into and it SUCKS. But that doesn’t mean Blizzard should make drastic changes because of it. 
---
There is already a way for people to escape the madness: re-roll on a PvE server or just wait it out. It isn’t as if you have 0 options... people just don’t like those options. The game has been out for less than 3 months, lots of progress can be made in 3 months, but this game will last YEARS there is plenty of time for progress to be redone even for the most casual players. I feel for those players and would be really upset too... but I don’t think drastic changes should be made to cater to these players. It is awful right now but it won’t be like this forever with the phase outline blizzard has laid out. This is a temporary thing regardless if they make changes to it or not... people just didn’t realize how it would be but that doesn’t mean blizzard should go against their layout and make changes to cater to these individuals. You cannot just complain and complain when there are already options available to you. To be clear I agree it freaking sucks, I am an alliance player, but its not like there are 0 options to alleviate this... 
---
I do think battlegrounds will be released early like dire Maul did, but not less than a week after the honor system has been released...
---
&gt; could you show me a good Alliance streamer
---
Apes, but they pvp in groups mostly.
---
And im over here just having the time of my life :)
---
DHKs were bad for that exact reason. Everyone in the raid got punished by a random mob dying so city raids never happened anymore. The only cities that are raided in classic is light's hope and thorium point since no guards lol.
---
Because of the guards. High level zones dont have faction specific guards. Beeing outnumbered 3 to 1 there fucking sucks.
---
Indeed it could do. But fortunately it doesn't last very long.
---
You think you do but you don't
---
rude = factually correct apparently in the lefty safespace known as reddit
---
sorry about your feelings.
---
As a warrior, basically all I can do in Hillsbrad is leech HKs with the main group, maybe help kill the stragglers when the Horde retreats. What sucks is Alliance is grossly outnumbered on my server (63:37), so non-zerg WPVP is generally a bad idea. Any time you have any advantage, tons of Horde show up and camp you.
---
TL;DR until BGs are out, looks like DM spam is back on the menu.
---
Not the highest, but rank 4 at least.
---
Spamming rank 1 is exclusively for the healing meter.
---
Like, gl healing a tank bro.
---
Not even talking about what happen when there is a fuckup in the raid and you need to top several people ASAP, which means you will have to use higher ranks.
---
Horde is better? On Dragonscall (35/65) We shat on horde for hours. A pug raid and our 10 man guild group locked down searing gorge/BRD for hours. Our 10 men made 500 kills in a few hours not wiping once. This is how it looks like when we do not get outnumbered 3:1. Then at some point 90 horde players arrived. Our 10 players and the pug had the high ground. Horde rushed up and wiped us for the first time. We took two dozens with us. They go away. We rezz. They come back. We fight. We die. Still cool. Finally
---
Paid server xfers would be nice.
---
a shining example of reddit pseudo intellectual brain damage.
---
I am on Ashbringer too, my reasoning is that alliance lvl 60s are farming dungeons and raids and horde is farming alliance. I am lvl 51 and getting ganked by lvl 60 constantly.
---
I think roaming around to gank people is fine. That’s how world pvp starts. You gank a bit, they gather help and fight back, you get more people and retaliate, etc.
---
The scummy thing is to gank at choke points. Flight points, dungeon entrances, etc. yesterday I died because I ran out of Blackrock spire to see if we can port a player. I got an immediate cheap shot and charge and died in the stun. They don’t roam around looking for enemies. They camp the entrance and wait for enemies to come to them. And if too many come, they just run into the dungeon for safety.
---
if none of the classes require skill, still rogue requires the least of it.
---
I had great fun back in the days ,with my 39 lvl warlick twink. 100k kills
---
wrong decision. 
---
guild name checks out
---
so you ganked someone with bad internet. again when is the ICU beatdown going live.
---
Honestly? I don't mind. I've had MUCH more fun dueling people in front of OG than running around in a raid trying to find the lone questers or camping flight paths. I can't understand how people can enjoy this and if they're not, I can't understand how they put up with it for hours every day just to get gear that is marginally better than their T1.
---
It's the same for the wife, honestly.
---
Kinda, what I did for my low lvl friend is I just downranked my DOT and had him mass pull.
---
Sick run, congrats
---
Also on Ashbringer! I’m level 59 and I couldn’t be bothered to get constantly murdered right now. Being murdered is probably my least favorite thing. Where are you trying to level? Don’t reply in common.
---
It can't just be because of that, as it's happened to me more than once whilst alive :\
---
&gt;If you play on a PVP server you have had those 1 vs 1 moments, probably while leveling, where you have fought on relatively even terms with another player. 
---
This only happens if you initiate, other players wont attack you unless they have a significant advantage.
---
wPvP is not for ranking. It is statistically trash.
---
Come BGs, its irrelevant because of battlegroups.
---
You are expecting large numbers of people to swap for low honor returns, all while they lose their ability to freely farm materials to get an edge in BGs and raids (ie gear for pvp)?
---
Got some proof of that 70:30? Because it was already close to that before 3 guilds and wannabes swapped over a month ago
---
That made me laugh more than it probably should have.
---
I'm really just curious at this point, do you get a kick out of behaving this way?
---
I played the top end of Vanilla, and hes completely right.  The crazy min maxing is totally unnecessary at this stage of the game.
---
Bro i was trying to leave the party but I was tired asf after 6 hours of playing and accidentally abandoned him
---
thank you for posting this! i'm really interested in alpha/beta stuff for wow and despite me consuming everything i can find about the subject, i've never seen these changes mentioned or photos of them, makes me wonder what i would find if i checked out the client for myself! super interesting stuff
---
It will probably be like that in the later part of phase three when people have BWL gear. A big part of that is the ability to have a geared tank and healer who can hold down all the generals.
---
Spy addon... your noobness is showing.
---
This is why I'm not going out of my way to look for PvP for a good couple of weeks yet, until the phase two launch zealousness has died down. It's a shame, PvP is my favourite thing in WoW, but it's almost unplayable right now.
---
You know what else is busted af? Going invisible (sometimes even in the middle of a fight!), and stunlocking your opponent from 100% to 0% health. Just rogue things, amirite?
---
Pretty awesome and fun! But that's not enough for the rogues, is it? They then think it's "busted" because they have a harder time sneaking up on people because going into stealth alerts enemies now! Boo hoooooo! How sad for you!
---
Blizzard has said that phase 1 was gonna be the longest phase. So each phase from now is gonna be less than 2.5 months. And Im pretty sure both BGs and BWL are coming when Phase 3 starts.
---
Judgement, but I guess you can't transfer anyway
---
Damn, a lot of hate for people enjoying the game in their own ways.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
yep see the guy saying if you dont like 10 players corpse camping you, maybe you dont actually like the pvp server experience.
---
I dont know who told you that but thats some foul language dude.
---
Blizzard never said they would release 6 phases over 3 years lmao
---
Randomly getting ganked/camped is fine.  Nobody has a problem with that.  It's dying before before the enemy players even load in every 50+ zone.  And then getting camped at the FP until you grave rez and hopefully you can hearth out.  There is no actual playing and this is not how it was in Vanilla.  This is a direct result of the population being 5x what it is supposed to be.  You can't get away from it because there is enough people to camp every zone and every FP.
---
Yeah. And a LOT of people already have a full build. They dont have anything to do for 8 weeks now.
---
Yes, although you only need enchanting to make it (not equip it). I specifically levelled enchanting to make it on my druid and still use it now with herb/alch.
---
Fuck drop the ban hammer. That's absolutely broken.
---
That's a good feeling.
---
This is as Feral bear tank.
---
Why should somebody feel bad when people regularly use moves that literally say in the tooltip "This causes a high amount of threat".  
---
Pulling with Faerie Fire and los people still throw their biggest hit in first before i've even physically gone near the thing.
---
This death ball pvp *is* boring and always has been.  Everyone is so fixated on ranking.
---
The battlemasters have been in the game since day 1. We'll be able to queue from them as opposed to visiting the battleground instance portals.
---
So far classic wow doesnt even hold a candle to lights hope or nostalrius. Can someone give me a high pop pvp realm with faction balance? I just wanna have well balanced wpvp ffs. It was awesome on the  private servers... havent found a good server in classic
---
&gt; wishing shit like that would happen in the game he's playing then.
---
And then his buddies would be like 'haha totally, that would be awesome ^don't ^remove ^your ^headset '.
---
But then he'd remove his headset and find himself in his chair in MS13 territory, chatting up the guy running the MS13 guild.
---
I’m gonna go ahead and say that the majority of raiders don’t have full BiS yet. Just inspect random 60s in .Org or SW. 
---
Many MDPS are lucky to have a Brut blade, let alone Perd’s or one of the rarer drops. Very few people have legitimately no reason to raid (gear wise) yet.
---
Thanks for a great bit of fun Hordies. :) GG until the next time!
---
Tailors can make excellent gear that is BoP (I believe the truefaith vestments for example are BoP), but obviously it's very specialized gear for specific characters and builds. Aside from what you've already mentioned, my knowledge ends there :p
---
I'm actually not disputing whether what you said was right. For the sake of argument, let's say that everything you say is right. Why do you choose to pair it with insults? I'm genuinely curious why you treat people so poorly online.
---
no streamers are good, at all. they all have the same worn out tactic that the leftist media uses of being inflammatory and irritating. bad press is good press.
---
total trash. if anything streamers and "influencers" should be rounded up and gassed. it is essentially propaganda and is an extreme danger to a free society.
---
I feel exactly the same way. And it's really painful when you have your professions at 300, to just start over on a new server. I just with they allow paid transfers soon, I don't mind losing some money to continue having fun the way I had until now.
---
Move in blasted lands go invuln at 1% and can't be killed. Closest thing there is. But it's also not boss level.
---
People without 60s should just be living in instances. It's not ideal but it does solve the problem
---
That's unnecessary. His felcloth robe is fine.
---
20 warriors, 2 or 3 jump skips, free action pots on gehennas, aoe sulf and domo
---
Join quest runs for this type of experience. 
---
People farming want to farm as fast as possible because by the 30th run it gets pretty boring and saving a second here or there can mean a lot.
---
This is skeram and fandoms. It actually felt fast and fluent like we didn’t go slow at all we just killed EVERYTHING it was dope!
---
What addon is that where hes switchin his gear off the character screen
---
what did y'all conclude?
---
Well, it's a bit overused argument, but... Why did you roll on a PvP server?
---
Why does it matter if you’re horde
---
Nah, he'll get the oldest virgin ever award one day. I guarantee it.
---
This entire thread is one great example where Blizzard's often ridiculed statement "You think you but you don't" actually holds true.
---
People wanted the true vanilla experience, including the phase when World PvP was the only way to farm honor. 
---
But suddenly you want it with stipulations. Now you want #changes. Getting camped is part of world pvp. Controlling a high traffic area such a dungeon entrance or flight path is world pvp. 
---
Stop lying and saying it is somehow worse now than it was when Vanilla originally released. It's not. You're not getting camped because of streamers or streaming culture. You're getting camped because you're in the same area as people farming honor and you're an easy kill. The world pvp phase was definitely worse during Vanilla's retail run when the WoW craze was at its highest and people.
---
Or maybe you just didn't think and want a scapegoat, hmmmmmm...
---
Im a mage, I think I may hold on to tailoring for now.
---
You realise that staying in the *deadzone* means the warrior cannot hit him, or charge/intercept him.
---
Horde is ezmode. It is known.
---
What are [these trousers that look like jeans](https://imgur.com/gSQzJee)?
---
i tried to level my 42 warlock in Tanaris, i kept getting killed by a 60 rogue
---
You are sadly mistaken about how shitty people are in online games.
---
Guess I'll die then. Said this waaaaaay to many times leveling my warrior.
---
This, but non-ironically.
---
They are entertainers, they are not required to be good at the game. Tipsout is a good example of this.
---
The first huge Classic+ expansion would build largely around Azshara I think. Centered around the Timbermaw Hold's scrapped underground BRM like dungeon complex, Hyjal, Azshara which is connected to the Timbermaw, and the Emerald Dream. The big raid being the barrow den prison that Illidan was kept in. Big Cenarion Circle themed expansion, pushing the conflict between the Night Elves and the Horde and the Timbermaw's continually strained neutrality as primary allies of the Alliance while this war rages on ever closer to their home.
---
Was thinking alch, not eng :)
---
You are not well.
---
It wouldn't to use humor instead of pure ridicule but that's besides the point. Great run and solid play. Glad to see Windsor buff goes unused, hope it stays that way.
---
Yes. Mage does fireball and bloodlust, priest does shield and mind blast, shaman does earth grab totem, healing wave and lightning bolt. 
---
I never had trouble with not getting agro hitting the shield though. Is your pet spamming furious howl? That can make it harder to grab agro.
---
They don't give many shits about pve, they are a pvp guild. If you think they went ally for the pve racials to get world first rag you would also think they would at least have a single human in the guild, best pve racials of any race in the game, but they do not have a single human in the guild.
---
Any chance to get the weakaura?
---
Myzreal is about 60/40 split ally to horde and the Tauren mill/ Southshore fightibg is fun and quite even. Def bolster up the horde here as we are quite close it feels
---
They also didnt say they would release BGs in Dec.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
I re rolled on a normal server, pvp was trash.
---
I'm not sure Blizzard really understand how much of a crisis the faction imbalance + transfer lock is.
---
If you're stuck on a PvP server with horrible imbalance (like me), and you can't transfer or reroll (if you've already sunk a lot of time in), then you're left with getting farmed or quitting. Many will quit, and this will eventually cause server/community collapse, and lost subscriptions WoW might never win back again. If it isn't fixed soon, it will accelerate and cascade.
---
Unfortunately you'll never get Horde to voluntarily transfer in large enough numbers to rebalance these servers; they only stand to lose free PvP farm, easy dungeon groups, and their friends/guildmates. I don't think there's any way to fix this through volunteerism, unless you literally give the dominant faction a greater incentive then what the have, e.g. free game time/other shit.
---
My heavy-handed suggestion is simple: those servers with the worst imbalances like Skeram... close them. Force everyone to take a free transfer to servers where it'd be favorable for faction balance. At least this way friends/guilds could coordinate transfers together, and it would kill two birds with one stone (removing an imbalanced server, while making another more balanced.) It's not without it's downsides, but it's pretty much the only practical option.
---
Pretty sure people said that 15 years ago as well, and look where we ended up.
---
The guides don't tell you what you want. The good guides tell you what is mathematically best. What you do with that information afterward is up to you.
---
probably better off with tailoring. alch mats are contested, runecloth drops in dungeons. if you have runecloth bag pattern, even if you bought it for some ridiculous price 20-50g, youll return that in less than a week of playing, especially if youre skinning as well.
---
I still remember going on that quest whilst NE. Most of the experience was like:
---
.........^where ^the ^hell ^am ^I ^going?
---
At least with a lock it's a clean wipe :)
---
I actually went back to retail, and don't intend to come back before BGs are released. Got enough of "world PVP" i.e. getting corpse camped by 20man horde raids in every lvl 60 zone.
---
all shit, all useless. more kardashians, but for gaming.
---
GAS
---
because i can
---
Not using spy when your enemies are using it? Your noobness is showing.
---
Where would you suggest feral druids and mana melee are placed?
---
It's funny how PvPers mocked everybody who rolled on PvE servers labeling them carebears. Guess what, the ability to opt-out from all this bullshit is actually a huge advantage gameplay wise.
---
Fuck I hate these posts. I'm gonna mass advertise spy in trade chat/in the middle of the streets just so more people install it
---
what a waste of bandwidth this was
---
Calling a fool a fool is one thing, saying a fool deserves misfortune is another.
---
And yet, you only see 0,01% of all guilds in the world manage to get a sub 33minutes run :)  
---
Dont you think after 10+ years that everything have been tested?
---
So being good at the game isn't entertainment?
---
being right is the only thing that matters. asshole is just a word the intellectually inferior use when they have been completely decimated.
---
ill have a number 3, hold the tomatoes please.
---
You can't
---
Massive tank shortage on my PvE server
---
Because Blizzard can control which faction you pick. I guarantee that if Blizzard enabled faction restrictions to balance servers, everyone would be bitching how they weren't allowed to roll Horde because every realm already hit 50% capacity 1hour after launch.
---
I would assume that thats ItemRack :)
---
From what I hear it seems that every server is 70/30 H:A.
---
No shiz
---
You do know we're getting the shitty nonefun AV right? The one that ends in 10 minutes because the horde just rush our boss?
---
Oof dude.
---
No shit
---
Ok boomer
---
&gt; Honestly the biggest problem is that people joined hugely populated servers.
---
Hard to choose otherwise when there were only 2 potential options initially.
---
Aha, well, that bit is obviously a meme but they are inflammatory and it's just a bunch of superfluous drama most of the ti.e like I said, it's for entertainment!
---
spinal reaper assumes youll be in a group and chain killing targets. YOU must kill them to gain the benefit. BRE is raw damage, always, even if you dont get the kill.
---
if you know you can get those kills for the rage gain, use spinal. otherwise just stick with BRE swords, and grab ashkandi after. dont fool yourself into thinking youre hitting r14 unless youre sharing or botting.
---
In my experience (I played pretty hardcore in Vanilla, dropped completely when TBC launched and came back for classic), what mainly changed was the aceess and spread of information. Back then, as a random nobody you had very little information (a lot of theorycrafting was done on guild forms and through direct discussions, in my guild at least) . Now, even before I made my hunter, I already had 10+ bookmarks with all the needed theory for playing one.
---
Not really since rewards for solo bgs are awful compared to premade in retail. You're forced in to finding others in retail if you want rewarded.
---
honestly if you find a way to include the formula from the link below, this would be addon of the year for me
---
Did you have a stroke while you wrote this?
---
Anyone can do that though by parsing their combat log - spy merely streamlines the process.
---
can you link spreadsheet?
---
Tanks are in high demand until you start raiding since each raid only needs a few tanks
---
It's based on honor not kills iirc
---
Literally this. If they can‘t get any reaction off you they tend to leave you be. Look at OP trying to get so much attention
---
They didn't realise how bad it would get :p
---
k so first off, he was mining, hence the iron node and him mining as i sprint up towards him (great eyes you got there buddy) second off if you think world pvp is having every cd always is silly, i had all of them up and no horde to be seen in 15 minutes, so i wanted to have fun, i know...silly
---
Not really a Blizzard problem, they cant force you to make alliance or horde. If you want to blame anyone or anything blame streamers with their cult groups.
---
Srsly? Moon loth bags are 24 gold on mograin since I can remember
---
Mate, people are too young for dude wheres my car references, but i get it. Good work
---
Winsor buff is alliance only so it rightfully makes your run not count
---
Imagine using the word noobness in 2019.
---
Tbf the meta was to afk out of range so that you wouldn't get ressed at the gy so the premade would get bored and cap the flags so usually the games were quick
---
Now not in 2 monthd
---
No. Buy you do kill the 40 farming pirates outside of Booty bay because it brings you joy.
---
No, I like me some reddit boomer tears
---
More people complain about people complaining than there are people actually complaining.
---
Also thinking about it
---
AND I am on mograin aka a balanced server
---
Just can't do anything in the world anymore
---
tell them to suck a fat cock
---
The ores arent worth much today. Everyone is doing jump runs. You rely on the disenchanting &amp; selling 6g+ items(weps). The mining is ONLY good when you get shards. You can be unlucky for a whole hour, where you can do 5 runs with 3 people and get hourcapped.
---
However. Strat live. Unless you have a SUPER geared group of 3, and even then, it's an annoying dungeon that will take very long time to clear. 
---
But for the sake of it, you do this 5 man and split with 5man, or do round robin on the orbs. Which means you can be without for a whole run. 
---
orbs on my server are 25-30g each, lets say you get ONE orb per run. One run takes (without the cannon boss area) 35-40min.
---
Within the same run of DME jumps(assuming you actually know how to do them correct), you would have done 2.5~ runs and the group would be closer to 100g in split on 3 man.
---
In DM you can also get lucky with books.
---
In conclusion. DME is always worth more than doing some fuckingr strat live. Please do your research.

The way TM vs SS plays out is exactly like I remember it. It just has drastically more players and less lag.
---
That’s why my friends and I would roam the other zones for PvP back in the day.
---
I don't understand how they can produce so many aggro with so little damage. If they could take a hit they would be great tanks.

How did that work out for you

Hold on a minute, his name is what?

what's gonna fix the zerging is dishonorable kills will actually matter next week once people have points to lose.  southshore inn farming and the like won't exist after that cuz dks have a big effect after tuesday.

You went undead male this time?!?, wtf bro.

Pretty much this is my experience as well. 10-15 years ago casually inviting ppl to go kill themselves and spitting out endless streams of racial and ethnicity based slurs was way more accepted (by players and staff both) than it is today.
---
It's a RPG. People being toxic isn't wrong and shouldn't be punished. There's assholes in real life, so it only makes sense for there to be assholes in a RPG too. If anything, the options players has to harrass others in game is too limited. I love the idea of servers having that one asshole guild and having other guilds organize against them. Kinda like the guys that crashed that funeral in vanilla WoW. Real fucking villains.

I seriously wonder why they havent implementing ny kind of population balancing buff of some kind. Fuck no changes, being outnumbered so badly does nothing for the longevity of a server.
---
r/whoosh
---
No it's not.
---
It detects buffs in combat log. When a player is in range any buffs (like stealth) will appear in your extended combat log and then the player is detected.
---
Seeing a bunch of people crying in the comments. You rolled a PvP server so you should expect this to be happening. It’s not even that bad you guys are just whining
---
The secret is that its a  gif and that how laggy it is
---
RIP CHEEKS
---
You give people way to much credit. The majority of the playerbase will not make a premade. So the majority of your games won't be against premades. 
---
Just like the majority of the playerbase currently stupidly farms honor in raids, while only a few select do it the right way.
---
I agree minus hydra. Watching him play with pshero in early BfA, he was awful. "NEXT!" was a common shout for him... He's either gone to shit, or never kept up, one of the two.
---
This is a great way to make your healers hate you and just let you die and heal other people that are actually taking raid damage and not using all their mana to let you keep casting spells. Them having to spam heals on you while you are furiously lifetapping can get other people killed and lead you lower damage overall for the raid just so you can try and top the dps meters.
---
rend's blessing?
---
By the time burning crusade was about to hit most people got their shit together and elitist jerks (the old guild /forums/website) were already posting class guides. EJ started becoming a thing around BWL.
---
As a horde player I honestly didn't think it'd be this bad.  In EPL tonight roaming with a group of 10.  Sometimes you'd see a group of 10-15 ally but then they'd get swarmed by 50 horde.  There were about 50 just waiting at LHC at one point, looked pretty much like Kargath on tuesday.  
---
I couldn't have imagined it'd be ally getting steamrolled this bad.
---
No it makes sense, just lacks some commas here and there.
---
imagine playing a game from 2005 and then telling people not to use old words

I can't ficking recall where I got it, but I swear to god I remember a boat going from steamwheedle port to somewhere eastern kingdoms. Idk if that was the case in any expansion. And i never played beta. Yet I fucking remember it. This blows my mind.
---
how many times i have to bo corpse camped and died by zergs to find one?
---
pretty casual player here, played for a couple hours today and as a level 50 toon it is pretty much unplayable, i would kill a couple mobs and then get destroyed by a roaming group of level 60s, im spending more time running back to my body than i am actually getting to level up. i've always played on PVP servers so i dont mind the scrimmage but its really irritating when im just getting absolutely flattened once every five minutes or so. i appreciate that blizz is trying to release classic similar to how they did back in the day but its kind of low brain to introduce an honor system without battlegrounds simply for the nostalgia of doing it the way it was released before. maybe im wrong - sue me
---
You just need a few people retaking graveyards and you get your fields zerg. Did it a lot of times, even in retail. Especially on Russian servers it was the norm to do.
---
Older games are usually the more glitchy ones though =D But as someone else pointed out, the issue is probably that Blizzard stays on top of that stuff, like when people did the AQ40 skip.
---
I never saw somebody lambasted for not having BiS. People farm those hard to get items because they want to.
---
Sounds like your healers need to look for a better guild
---
The queues on most servers sill definitely be longer for horde. On some servers alliance will have instant bg while horde will be waiting a very long time.
---
You cant vanish as you get hit.
---
Are you seriously trying to imply anyone that plays UD is bad? Or that fucking pshero of all people is bad at rogue? 
---
Boi you salty as hell
---
I play a Rogue, I don't mind it. The fact you can see literally anything enemy players do in the Combat log means it makes no difference other than notifying you without having to change chat channel.
---
I am really glad I am not the only one thinking like this. I played on pvp servers only in vanilla, both horde and alliance and it was never that bad. People kept doing their stuff like farming or leveling, raiding, professions. The only thing 90% of the people are doing is killing other players in the world like it is the only thing to do.
---
I know lul Casual lul but this is ruining the game for pretty much every player that isn't 60 yet. The gaming mentality of people changed since 2005 and we are experiencing it first hand

PvP on classic servers isn't a vanilla experience, full servers were capped at 2.5k now we have 10k players on a server easy. If you don't see why this is a problem you might be a bit touched in the head.
---
Phase 1?  
---
Phase 2 started on the 12th  
---
This run was on the 13th?
---
Explain
---
I'll judge your comment, it's incredibly fucking stupid. You're supposed to be moving around constantly, and as a result there's a stream of horde coming in in smaller packs rather than overwhelm you at once.
---
P2 would've been fine if blizzard actually balanced the servers.  They did not.
---
I'm alliance skeram and horde is so desperate for honor that Ironforge usually has 2-3 horde raids sitting outside our front gate, in the mystic ward houses, and the tram.
---
I think people who rolled on a PvP server actually expected that blizzard had already learned one of the most basic lessons from a game that's been out 15 years - FACTION BALANCE MATTERS.
---
IMO I’m enjoying phase 2 because I am not focusing on farming rank. Its just more group fights and action. If you’re min maxing honor gain I could see how it’s tedious, or if you’re trying to level in contested zones. But for a geared 60 it’s just makes the world more alive, which is one or the benefits of the vanilla ranking system. It encourages pvp. The downside is having to no life for months unending to get to the highest ranks, but that’s your prerogative if you choose to do so.

Again if you are 50 that is not casual that is barely playing the game, you can tell me what is and isnt possible all you want but I know multiple people who only play a hour or so a day that are in bis pre raid gear and are raiding, hell I have a friend that could barely play at launch due to the q's on herod, having kids, work and school. and hit like 45 before he quit about a month in due to all of those things.
---
bro mom said it was my turn to post this
---
I swear there are more horde than alliance on Ashbringer. Every fight the horde always bring 3x the amount alliance have.
---
There is no reason you'd get killed at level 20 since you're not worth any honor.  Should be fine till you hit 50.
---
I know this is anecdotal but managed to quest a whole lot yesterday, just had to accept deaths every now and then as the roaming groups came, keep you local alliance members informed and if they are fighting to secure an area either do quests that take you as far away as you can for a bit or if they are winning stay close and use them for protection.
---
Fuck, should've rolled PvE then.
---
warchief buff is horde only.   Does that invalidate logs as well?  Genuine question.
---
Yeah - I know some guildies of mine have made a wannabe spy from weak auras incase spy does get banned.
---
You can get wcb by mcing ally in org or wherever it is
---
Imagine all the people
---
They must have at least doubled the population on the servers since Vanilla. I think it sucks actually, the world isn't built for this many people, and the addition of the honor system before bg's made it unbearable.
---
I would think its rank 1-10 from 10-59. ranks 11-14 are lvl 60 only rewards. 
---
I myself was rank 6-8 while leveling in the 40-58 range. I was rank 10 after hitting 60. So I know for sure if you can hit rank 8 before 60.
---
You can be MCd and receive the buff.
---
P2 was 14th
---
Oh simple, just don't log in. u/AccomplishedCoffee probably
---
Idiot DPS make a long dungeon even longer.  I don't even tank this for guildies if I can help it.
---
EU server, 1 day delay.
---
Typing /tar g`horghlamnh`ebeth is something you feel you have time for when that name pops up in the logs?
---
Ok thanks!
---
I was in a good raid that utilized combat maneuvers and everything, it’s all about macro control of the fight. Cuz yeah, the micro is boring. I just try to enjoy the scale of it all.
---
lets be honest channel probably has &lt; 5 viewers by that time.
---
What is that music played? I hear it a lot in videos.
---
The dude isn't memeing lmao.
---
Pro tip, you don't have to type the full name. Literally "/tar gho" would work for that. So would "/tar g" technically but then you risk targeting something else starting with a G.
---
On Gehennas there are multiple raids in most high level zones.
---
You want the weapon with the highest average damage per hit generally. That usually means the slower weapon because it attacks slower but hits harder.  This is good because abilities are instant attacks and the weapon speed isn't a hindrance.
---
Ouch. I have a pretty good job; check my account created on twitch. ‘‘Twas tonight friend. Sorry you’re so angry! Upvoted!
---
Yeah. I like to whisper other warriors who post 'looking for a tank' in chat and ask them what their excuse is.
---
I dont get it. Pride in not having the right items? Seems odd.
---
I install the add-on but just can't get it to track anything. The window remains empty. I've tried checking the options for /fl and still dunno what's missing. Any ideas?
---
Aw man I thought i was funny that they got me three times; the third being after a pretty long break. But yeah if you didn’t laugh; it was pointless; keep scrolling!
---
Nobody is holding a gun to your head and forces you to BG as a casual fuck. Go hardcore or go home, premade 10 hour a day or don't play. And yes, i'm being sarcastic.
---
God damn this subreddit is nothing but cry baby alliance cunts.
---
Yeah totally not disappointing for some rando on the internet to care so much about an internet personality. 
---
"THIS ONE STREAMER HAS RUINED THE GAME I CANNOT BELIEVE IT".
---
If you really care about his classic experience you need to go outside or see a therapist. Hes not your friend because you donate to him, weirdchamp.
---
Poor hamsters :'(
---
That dude is a diamond in the rough
---
Personally I was at least expecting some crazy pet pulls or strange boss engagements. Like I can't believe there's nothing you can do with Golemagg, either by pulling him early or jumping down, clearing up to Majordomo and pulling Sulfuron up there. Even if bosses end up pulling trash packs I'm sure people could figure out some way of dealing with it. 
---
I'm imagining some route where a hunter perfectly times the pull of Sulfuron so that he arrives just as you kill the last trash near Majordomo then as Sulfuron dies someone has jumped down and douses and the raid instantly engages Majordomo. In the meanwhile the person who jumped suicides and gets summoned back to entrance of MC (or just gets replaced), then runs to Rag and times the start of the encounter so it's ready to go just as people arrive.
---
Does it still let you target them while they are stealth? Because if so then maybe something needs to be done. Because I don’t think normally you can target something if you can’t see it. I’ve been too lazy to download it though so I have no idea.
---
Yeah but it shows you need to grow up a little bit and stop being an angry little person. Not everyone is out to get you.
---
Ofcourse not, he just made this post to farm karma.
---
Asking the real questions.
---
How?
---
It's just that sunder armour generates threat and you can't use that if expose armour is already on.
---
Shit. Mine/Herb instead.
---
Or y'know. Go play retail
---
Monkeynews is skilled af but I haven't seen much solo stuff from him since classic launched.  His ps stuff is unreal for solo warrior pvp - it's on youtube.
---
Remember what the game was like before Tuesday?
---
Perd and Mirah's ofc.
---
Shittard entershitment... Like it!
---
huehuehue
---
And what people are suggesting is releasing that comment.
---
I fell into that trap. I thought it was "the best"
---
I played pve during vanilla. I thought "Hey, new experience, and it's the 'best' way to play? Alright I'll try it out."
---
Ya that shit was not for me
---
As the horde would say on my server
---
[Orcish] : g o T o RE T a IL
---
&gt;Alliance will happily "be the problem" when it serves them.
---
What do you propose they do though? Play always with WM on and get nothing done? 
---
During Legion, I liked to do my World Quests before work, while having breakfast. I don't know exactly why, but during that period of time (7-8 server time), I was constantly put in shards where I was vastly outnumbered. I'm talking 15 to 1. As you can imagine, trying to do WQs with that ratio was rather difficult, almost impossible. Fortunately I could swap to Discipline and be almost unkillable due to my gear, but most other players could not handle. 
---
Interestingly enough, during the evening, it was the opposite. I never saw any Horde player. I never understood why the dichotomy, but it made it very clear that doing stuff with WM:On as Alliance would be rough...and I had the chance to taste that during beta already.
---
If you re horde you ll have windfury anyway. If you re alliance.. eh depends on how invested you and your guild are on consumables and world buffs.
---
If there’s 8,000 of you, are you really a master?
---
Once something gets 'figured out' it always becomes less fun because of hyper conscientious people ruining it and turning it into an arms race
---
Like when there's a new sport (eg strongman).  Back in the day it was fun and weird and you had all sorts competing - and sometimes it was the man who figured out a new way of doing something, or who had the most heart, who won
---
Now, it's pretty much just all about who can start with the best genetic abnormalities and train the most ludicrously hard.  It's still a great sport, but it's been perfected and now we can only watch for the same tiny increments in performance every time
---
So world pvp used to be 'for the alliance/horde!' and now its 'whatever it takes for that 25 honour! Even if it's corpse camping 10:1 for hours!'
---
yourself?
---
What server are you playing on? There were plenty of free transfers issued by blizzard
---
Do you laugh at the people still speedrunning super Mario Bros?
---
OP: It sucks that you basically can't go anywhere without assembling a raid group 
---
you: Well then assemble a raid group every time you want to play
---
also you apparently: I feel like the other faction needing a raid group to play content impossible to complete in a raid is entirely reasonable and intended by the developers.
---
Pretty sure I heard....
---
Op hating on players who speedrun 1-10
---
The data shown there is very old and most likely inaccurate
---
Just play the superior faction.
---
Should take a regular engineer a week max to understand and rework the queue.
---
Imagine getting jumped in an alley and then bitching about fair fights and how God needs to re-balance everything
---
It's the world. Of Warcraft
---
Daggers. 3 options;
---
Imp sprint prep (16-12-23)
---
CB prep (21-8-22)
---
Deep-ish sub (16-8-27)
---
If you re hit capped without 2 pts in precision go for either 21-8-22 or 16-8-27. If you re not, go imp sprint.
---
Some go 14-14-23 instead of 16-12-23, I personally dont.
---
CHT.
---
Cause Mindblast dos more Aggro then it dos dmg, and if you debuff even VE its Healing aggro too.
---
And you can "Tank" as a shadow since with Buffs you have nearly 50% phy dmg reduction, for 5man its more then fine\^\^
---
I played on PvP or RPPvP for over ten years on retail.
---
Classic started up and because I'm a stupid smartie who saw this coming I decided to roll PvE.
---
.........and here we are.
---
Hunter here.  Literally never seen anything with 'track hidden'
---
Got spy addon just for the enemy count in huge battles, didn't even know it counted rogues... Its very broken.  Surely it must go against some rules??
---
Dont mount up, stay in stealth, if unsure peel for backline. If you know what you re doing and have cds + prep, can dive stragglers but be careful of aoe.
---
Why does everyone think their guild is the “top” on their server lmfao give me a break
---
mind control is basically a taunt as well.
---
The brackets are based on a percentage of players, and if that percentage equates to less than 1 then it’s not possible for someone to be in that bracket.
---
3 perds in 3 weeks lol. I have mine. Now for CHT on Wednesday.
---
Warhammer was fucking brilliant, it just came out like 3 years too late
---
There's a reason people mostly stopped trying this after thursday.  It results in getting camped until people log off.
---
Dont go SF before getting AQ gear.
---
Faction balance isn't Blizzard's problem. They released Classic as it was and the new meta in gaming is min/maxing. 
---
This actually kind of goes back to the, "You think you do, but you don't." I am glad they released Classic, as is, but those little annoying things you forgot about are piling up and presenting themselves. And now people want Blizzard to go in and change certain things to make the experience better.
---
Pretty sure 15 years ago no one was trying to transition their toddler and you didn't have the internet on your phone everywhere.  The player with the most impact on your server was likely the one tank with thunderfury and not some toxic streamer.
---
So yeah, the human condition in the game has changed at least a smidge.
---
&gt; OMG guys, I figured it out, you just have to come with more people, its soooo easy! 
---
Seriously, that deserves a shit response.
---
Yeah, yesterday we had about 2 hours of awesome battles in hillsbrad where both sides would line up and fight to the death - and both sides got tons of HKs
---
Then for some reason it turned into what you say - mounting up and both sides running back and forth and killing any unlucky fool who fell behind.  No fun, and no HKs either.  Just retardation
---
In the nicest way possible, fuck you.
---
Everyone is 60
---
Its shit but what can you do..
---
Not gaining anything from it, isn't a deterrent... There is no real consequence or risk to it.
---
The bottom line is that it's well within people's right to complain about being ganked and corpse camped, because it's just a shitty thing to do, and a terrible experience. Just because one might complain about that, doesn't mean they would play on a PVE server instead. I did, for å time, and the fact that I didn't even have the option to fight, took away from the experience. It is ironic that a basically stay away from it unless provoked, now that Im back on a PVP server - but I still prefer it most of the time. Its just that running into assholes who just wants to ruin your experience, really sucks when there's nothing you can do about it than stop playing.
---
Leave if you don't like the people, stay if you do.
---
asking as your sever isn't dead there can be pugs U can join for the next few weeks till the second team gets off the ground. If that dosnt come to fruition then leave
---
Also get better. There is lots U can do to prepare and improve outside of actually doing the fights. 
---
Most of the fights are extremely simple with only a couple of relevant mechanics which are easy to research. 
---
I don't see how you could've died that much tbh ( unless ur counting raid wipes) 
---
Have a Fire resist set if your dieing heaps. Or even better just use your normal set so U can pump damage but use fire resist pots continuously so U don't die. Take same arcane resist for Shaz and your good to go. 
---
On a side note , Don't open really hard and get aggro wait for a while then pop off. Every one is obsessed with doing huge openers because that has been the META in retail for a long time. However in classic if you arnt gonna get a second set of CDs in and don't have on use trinkets or effects that proc on pull you can hold your CDs till mid or late in the fight.
---
Hamstring should be on the same button as taunt.
---
Don't do it and dont pvp while levelling. Just get to 60.
---
hOw iS tHaT fUN1!1!??
---
I thought pst was "whisper". Mind blown when I was told it's "please send tell".
---
I hope whenever someone orders it, the whole staff starts erupting with "DID SOMEONE ORDER [THUNDERFURY...]?"
---
Lol I'm a rogue and I approve the post!
---
At this point though it’s kind of entertaining. I think the point being made is kinda more like people complaining about world PvP on a PvP server.
---
A two hour Mind Control Odyssey is pushing it, but I know I’d find that a hilarious to the typical monotony.
---
&gt; There were plenty of free transfers issued by blizzard
---
Such a BS response for people that have formed any meaningful bonds in the game.  I HATE MY SERVER!   I don't want to leave though, because I love my guild, and I'm in a damn find raid group.   
---
BUT HOLY SHIT.  I HATE WHITEMANE SO HARD RIGHT NOW.
---
Imagine needing to spam reddit to pray people give a fuck about these guilds
---
You havw herb and alch + stealth and can't make money? 
---
Mate..
---
Can you please post a version of this without that music? Really want to watch it and hear the talking without that over the top.
---
Aside from, like, fun?
---
Vanilla wasn't like this at all, lol. Vanilla had like 1/3rd of the population on the most populated servers....
---
crYcrYcrY
---
Dragonfang is a Great server were you need to be polite and get to know other players.
---
The game I most enjoyed world pvp in is Eve online, where that's like, half the game. So everything is designed around it.
---
Do you have a source by chance?  I really hope it's true.   I may actually queue every once in a while, if that's the case.
---
This... so much this!!
---
Cause all that matters in pve is dmg out put for dps classes not survivability. Shrouded mists is your BiS cloak if you wanna pvp.
---
Warriors remember to use intimidating shout against deadzone kiting! Intercept/charge got 8yd min range while intimidating shout got 10yd max range! There is no deadzone between those!
---
Dont poison MH in dungeons/raids.
---
So you could all transfer. Are you the only one complaining?
---
Are there going to come fresh servers as the game progresses?
---
There's a mage in my guild who says "gaaaarbage" in Discord whenever a non-BiS mage T1 piece drops in MC and mocks whoever rolls on it out of interest. It irritates me a lot because if he wasn't interested in the gear, then the least he could do was to not say anything at all.
---
Perhaps the moonkin aura? 3% spell crit. Dunno though, it might just be to be able to boast about being quicker even with a moonkin.
---
For the horde!
---
Try being less insecure about things
---
Yea it's kinda sad to see that we will probably never go back to what MMOs were like so many years ago.
---
Small scale pvp is fun if you're coordinated and have a decent comp. You can easily overcome small numbers defecits vs randos. However yeah rando vs rando it doesn't take much extra numbers on one side to make it unfun.
---
My first thought was “hmm I gotta try that in Orgrimmar/Kargath one day too”.
---
Then I realised I don’t even need to leave Stormwind if I want pvp
---
&gt; which doesn't help at all in a discussion involving the faction splits on PVP servers.
---
THe dicussion isn't about faction splits on a pvp server, it's about BG queues. BGs are gonna be crssrealm, so all players can take part. The total faction split is near evenly split.
---
here, take a downvote
---
It's almost tragic that you think people with jobs and school would ever in a million years care about something like this. 
---
Literally no one gives a shit. Imagine having 35 days played just to clear 15 year old content.
---
Blizzard should introduce faction specific queues and not allow people to create characters on the dominant faction if the server's ratio is above 60-40.
---
You can't change my mind.
---
What level is your twink? Under 60 characters get less honor, so getting to rank 10 as a non-60 seems like a quite challenging task as there are fewer targets available and you get less honour from each kill.
---
Learn how to play man.. wtf are you thinking? Heal up, mana up and bubble up and join your teammates.
---
The outcry was for the transfers to be faction specific or operate dynamically upon opening. Most people who are upset now are the ones that were caught when the lockout was implemented without warning, including people who became separated from levelling friends or their guild.
---
They do in duels, hell no do they outclass them HANDILY in WPvP where everything goes.   
---
Mages and Rogues have the higher on demand burst to nuke down unprepared foes quick. They have superior CC through multiple forms of it. Their lack of self-heal abilities are made up by either killing, CC-ing or fleeing from opponents before they need it. Without the restrictions duels place on them it's not that hard to pull this off.   
---
Warlocks and Priests are tankier but they are less mobile and their initial punch is often weaker. They have less CC in their kit and give slower deaths. They lack mobility, it is much harder to gain a positional advantage once they are stuck in an unfavorable position. They lack moves that allow them to dodge them from being the focus of incoming attacks or break CC like Iceblock and Vanish do. If 3 opponents decide to tunnel vision a Priest or Warlock then they have a much harder time breaking out of it.  
---
   
---
Half of the Warlock and Priest's toolkit is designed around outlasting opponents through damage reductions combined with self heals. Low mobility is a non-issue if your opponent is in a convinced location (duel range). this is reason why they are ultimately stronger in duels. But they are not the handily better class at 1vX in WPvP.
---
Speedruns of other games mostly involve glitching through barriers in order to get out of the playable area and bypass 75% of the game. I don't think blizzard is going to be happy with that
---
Yes there will be less world pvp and ganking once BGs are out in a couple months.
---
You are right, but the thing is that you can use it only once per fight. You use it, you charge/intercept the rogue, the rogue gouges you, and he goes back to the deadzone. Kiting a warrior in the deadzone is no easy task, and not every rogue can do it. Also, you need to have Crippling poison on for this to work. Here's a video where you can see this strategy better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtMsTlNowQ0
---
Does anyone else get big headache problems just from playing for a couple of hours?
---
You notice people stare at you strangely as you say "Time for you to git gud I would say" to yourself in the hospital lobby.
---
I want to  try the 0/24/27 Elemental Fire mage build. I think Imp Counterspell isn't worth sacrificing 15 points in Arcane when you could gain the burst damage Fire talents provide. This is the build I found most viable.
---
 https://imgur.com/pIkPXP0 
---
Is critical mass worth keeping? Or Is it better to switch it for 3 points in Elemental Precision, Imp Fire Blast or Ice Shards?
---
Any opinions???
---
The rogues on any faction on any server are the weakest performing class cause its a glass cannon melee class that actually takes skill (less if hemo swords instead of daggers ofc but still).
---
Breaks stuns on every class except rogues/ warlocks and mages, so yeah most of them :( and mages can blink and ice block in stun anway
---
Thanks :D I was in a DnD mood tonight for some reason. I was impressed with myself.
---
40, I get about 70 honor per kill. But It's also a lot easier to farm honor on lower levels
---
There sure isn't more anonymity on the Internet today. Even wow has much less anonymity after battle.net username was implemented.
---
ZF I think.
---
People use channel /4 LFG ???
---
Whenever I see a warrior they come as dps. Rarely they tank, but luckily I play feral tank so that is one less worry.
---
What's your primary focus, PvP or PvE?  Either way I think you're gimping yourself by spreading too thin instead of focusing on one element.
---
Benediction was 50/50 upon launch but lately I've been seeing data points that suggest it's tipping towards 40/60 in Horde's favour. There are still plenty of Allys roaming around but a lot of people I know (plus myself) are getting worried about potential imbalance which may trigger an exodus on the Alliance side.
---
Wouldn't it be better to just start on a pve server to begin with and then you've always got the option to turn pvp on or off anyway?
---
Yeah, I don't mind pvp, but the inability to quest and not engage in pvp right now is a drag. I have played both PvP and PvE servers and I would have rolled PvE of not for friends I came back with...who are of course no longer playing despite talking about how much they wanted to PvP. I am content with bgs. Now I have a 59 character on a server I pretty much loathe.
---
fuck that video is cancer
---
Also seeing WSG and keychain in early December is also something you should expect.
---
Prophecy shoulders should be replaced with either burial shawl or PvP blue shoulders, head with T2 or CAC if lucky, gloves with the exalted gloves from BRD and boots of the full moon from DM.
---
That's if you want to optimise your gear.
---
so inaccurate. Rolled on a pvp server because my friends did and i dont mind some world pvp...  
---
But this? this is absolute shitstorm for alliance players
---
2 questions: do you actually do any pvp ?
---
And what does the word noob mean to you?
---
PvPing as hunter now seems harder. Mages actually know that they need to go close range and dont flat out try to outdamage you at range.
---
did you miss the part where it says “hunter”?
---
obviously hunter prio
---
OCD triggered by misuse of meme format.
---
From what I heard the dmg of boomkins is so bad that the 3% spellkrit don't make up for the potential damage of having another mage instead. Don't know though.
---
If it was just for MotW they could have used a resto. Maybe just to rub it in? "We beat you with a moonkin in our raid!"
---
CR without taking a healing spot from a priest with CoH too.
---
How is daggers better for CC?  Forgot to mention I am human though, so I guess swords would be better.  But are daggers still better for burst and 1 vs 1s?
---
That still happens in BFA FWIW. The games only been out for 15 years, so it's unreasonable to expect blink to bave been fixed ^^/s
---
&gt; Taren Mill have PvP raids 24/7.
---
Yeah but thats no fun. At least to me. 
---
How often do you see people in the world from the other faction that you can't attack? 99% of the time? 
---
I mean i get it, you dont want world pvp all the time but i do! If i want to attack someone i can. The faction balance on my server is around 65 / 35 in favor for the Horde and its hard sometimes to find people to pvp. Can't imagine how its on a PvE server with a same-ish balance but 90% of the alliance players are not pvp flagged.
---
WIN+SHIFT+S
---
How was the movie btw?  Worth the watch for a WoW fan, even though I'm not that deep in Warcraft lore?
---
No but I expect WSG will be out in December, they’re already said keychain is coming this year so you should expect them to add WSG and keychain as a December patch.
---
Yeah, you have to wait because your faction has too many people online, that doesn’t change because you decide to do pve when you log in.
---
Look another post where someone brags about going to a dungeon
---
Last few days i mostly see allies ganking squads.
---
Cool thanks.  And would any of those builds be 'Ok' for PVE.  We are allowed pvp specs in the second raiding team.
---
&gt; There is no actual playing and this is not how it was in Vanilla.
---
This is exactly how it was in vanilla. A major issue with the undead faction was getting to new places before you could get camped by all the alliance, trying to set hearth. 
---
The only difference is that it's the alliance getting camped this time.
---
Server size was obviously going to be a problem, I doubt the devs werent aware of that. I think removing layers and adding honor in the same week was a big mistake.
---
Aka all three of my classes -.- lmao
---
&gt; if you had a server that had a shitty faction balance you did your research and played on a different server
---
I love how people parrot this like it's a trivial thing to do with how Blizzard has done everything they can to keep this piece of information as opaque as possible.
---
1 million upvotes for you.
---
I hear what you're saying but TM vs SS is incredibly bad for honor.
---
It’s not complicated, it’s a server que for people who have horde on a horde dominated pvp server. Many private servers were able to create this system in a few days
---
Cone of cold is one of the strongest and most important spells in the mage kit. You’re severely limiting yourself by not using it.
---
As far as a PvP frost spec goes, this is the build I use: https://youtu.be/e-vanFott_Q
---
you could pvp forever but you'll never achieve the same rate of honor a lvl 60 would
---
But classic is modern now. You're paying for it, therefore it's modern. 10/10 logic glad you posted.
---
Kek
---
It seems like his current guild did nothing to make him loyal other than a half assed promise of a second raid group with no real effort put into it. I would leave too without thinking much about it. There's nothing to feel bad about, the Guild didn't invest a single resource into that guy.
---
Why isn't it deserving of downvotes lol?
---
You have no choice *but* to overdo it thanks to the way the PvP system is designed, if you want that gear. And I sincerely doubt that the vast majority of the people out there camping flight points and dungeon entrances are doing it because they find it fun. The reason I doubt that is because it wasn't happening before Phase 2, and if they were doing it just for fun there's absolutely no reason why they wouldn't have been doing it in phase 1. 
---
They're doing it for the gear. And as such they'll just keep doing it.
---
Cheers mate for explaining. Apparently I deserve down votes for suggesting it tho :(
---
Because I liked the occasional PvP in the open world. Not getting zerged by a group of people every 10 minutes.
---
fuck that video is lovely
---
If it shows up in the combat log, Spy can detect it. I'm not sure if applying poisons while stealthed shows up in the combat log though.
---
Doesn’t sinister strike add a fixed dmg increase regardless of weapon or am I mistaken?
---
*writes down in priest notes*
---
fuuuu, ur right.  in 1.12 it was released.  either way I still think horde are more PvP focused and will be the ones waiting for allies to queue up
---
Yeah you can. In vanilla I was Lieutenant commander at lvl 49
---
Lucassss
---
People were assholes in vanilla, people were assholes in TBC, people are always assholes. It sucks if you want to do PvE only and all your friends are on a PvP server, but this is a part of the game. I remember turning off the computer in a tantrum of rage when I was 12 years old playing vanilla many times because I was being corpse camped. I didn’t like it then, and I don’t like it now. So I play PvE now for a more casual experience.
---
Sure people might have gotten to this point a bit faster in Classic than in vanilla, because it already happened, but massive, server-wide battles and butt-hurt, and guild drama is par for the course with WoW.
---
was the mage a higher level than you?
---
The fast OH thing is from the time where combat potency gave you additional energy. Combat potency doesn't exist in classic. Yes, you still want to have a quick OH for instant poison procs (please don't use up a debuff slot) but you don't want to sacrifice weapon DPS, especially if you have a goog ampount on %hit on your gear.
---
So yes, at same DPS, pick the fast OH, but i guess at 3-4dps difference, go for the slower one.
---
[This skip is new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA1RpeuqDOw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=430) and not really seen too much in the private server seen.
---
Some stuff aren't feasible with the current gear. If you are interested, here are some examples from private servers we might see during classic.
---
[MC 18 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxdbQ2mgUfQ&amp;t=5s), 2 groups do Lucifron and Magmadar and the others do the rest of the bosses, they then meet at Ragnaros.
---
[BWL invis pots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taDfDfWyKWQ) between firemaw and ebonroc
---
[BWL Immune Flask skips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZcLo5uXK-I&amp;t=973s) where they use Flask of Petrification on a rogue to pull mobs so the rest can skip. They also kill Flamegor and Ebonroc at the same time.
---
[AQ Pack skips after Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZnlMyzCEOk), not revolutionary but done because the tactic of stealthing past this trash was nerfed on this private server. They also use pets/rogues to pull packs of mobs so they can skip.
---
Naxxramas will be interesting, [here is a pure brute force run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsmWC9XGtyg). Some simple skips are present but nothing too major.
---
And yes this is private servers, but tactics and mindset are still the same
---
I am sure most of these times will be beaten on classic when players get more and more gear, and as I said, some tactics are not feasible yet with the current gear. ZG World buff is not out yet either, that will help clear times. Gonna be interesting to see if we see 20-20 splits inside Naxx going different quarters.
---
At what time are they good at killing mobs then?
---
3% spellcrit is huge for holy paladins at least.
---
Naxx rogue C tier DA FUCK. THEY HAVE DAGGERS ON THEIR FUUUUCKING SHOULDERS WAT IS U MEEAAAAN
---
but they are great for honour, just sit there leeching and you'll get more honour than the 3-5 mans who are going around looking for fights by far.
---
Imp sprint gives you 2% hit so.. its the closest to pvp i guess. If you re hit capped in pbe without any points in precision (prob full epics with ony neck acuria and ns gloves/shoulders + ranged weap + another ring like blackstone or tarnished elven and DM trinket) then you can be any dagger spec really if your raid allows you to, especially with consumables and world buffs cause you ll crit every backstab and crit for a lot..
---
Im always curious with these crazy speedruns. Has anyone tried splitting the run up? Ie send half the raid for the first 2 bosses (and some sort of speed boost to get them back - either buff or pots) while the rest are clearing down to Garr. Could definitely also split for Sulfuron and Golemagg (would also be interesting to see them pull Geddon and Shazz together, though that'd be more for memes than speed).
---
Could also have one guy already at Rag's sanctum to start up the cutscene while they are returning from Domo.
---
Wide one, takes a while but you’ll get em down
---
No, I'm not asking for exploits. But considering the sort of shenanigans people get up to in dungeons it's strange to see MC speed runs being approached so plainly.
---
Waste of Gold if it's not a split raid.
---
Wow alliance could really use that port.
---
You can't taunt in battle or berserker stance. You can't hamstring in defensive stance.
---
Ergo, they can both be on the same button and it won't restrict access to either.
---
Lol quit classic wow
---
13* 
---
Who needs 14 when you have HoR
---
I won OH in my first UBRS run and MH about four or five runs later. But I’m over 30 and counting on HoJ. I know that’s low compared to some but I hate having that damn trinket tell me how to play the game.
---
So you don't use it then, of course?
---
It's cool to see all these private server guilds leave the prominent retail guilds in the dust.
---
Good shit spamming blizzard with false reports, that’ll def help
---
It’s already dying down... zones like EPL were still quite busy in the early morning yesterday, and hillsbrad had 40v40 going on at 4am. This morning, EPL was so dead we couldn’t even get 300 honour per hour and hillsbrad was 20v25 at the same time.
---
Mostly PvP. I think the only big dissadvantage Ele mage has is the lack of Ice barrier. But you gain Pyro and Blast Wave and all the dmg advantages of Fire talents.   
---
If I start raiding I know I'll have to change into  Frost.
---
Thats only one part of wpvp. Those dudes are strictly farming honor. And not very efficiently. Wpvp is fun.
---
Rogue is already one of our easier match ups. We have lots of tools to deal with them.
---
What are you doing? You’re literally a free HK.
---
Dude, spend 5g on 2 FAPs and it’ll take you 7-10 min max
---
Closing the massively imbalanced server is not a bad idea. Only downside I can think of is people complaining about names
---
lol this fuckin sub is like a moron society
---
well its not vanilla and everyone and their mother has been setting out warning about this type of shit happening. this has so many more players then vanilla its to be expected alot of players means alot of zerg death balls I've been run over by my fair share of zergs or being out numbered 5 to 1 when i'm out farming but i put up a fight lose try again if that failed i take the dura hit and go. sometimes i'll bitch to guildies see if they will help me out often times they dont want to but holy fuck its nothing but bitch bitch bitch on this fucking reddit.
---
Its not at all the same, but its the stock excuse they use in every thread about spy that gets posted. If it were the same, no one would use spy. They would just use a combat log window. 
---
I say if you cant ban it, make it default in the client.
---
On guild wars 2, I had someone rage whisper me and insult me using my IRL name. I don’t have any IRL people that play this game, and none of my characters reveal my name.
---
Needless to say I was spooked
---
So if you'd be camped by level 60 rogues when you're leveling an alt you wouldn't complain at all?
---
you're a hordie rogue, no wonder you have little issue with this crap
---
And it sucks as a source of honor as well. Killing 20 people there gives about as much honor as killing one person on your own.
---
Suck it up. Get good. Get camped. Get honor. It’s classic. It’s not about being fair. It’s about playing the game. Sometimes it sucks, sometimes it doesn’t.  If your server is out numbered:
---
A) reroll
---
B) focus on dungeons and pve and wait for bgs.
---
C) make a group attack smart not hard and get more honor then the rest of your camped server. If you are out numbered there is more to kill. Find a way. 
---
Ppl complain are why we have BFA. If you want perfectly tuned and balanced game play.
---
Go. Back. To. Retail.
---
TLDR quit or fight smart if you are complaining about faction imbalance.
---
I give it 3-4 weeks
---
I have the exact same macro! Except I don’t know how to make the tooltip change like that
---
If you look at the logs the Druid is basically there for mark, FF, battle Rez, decurse, 3% spell crit and hurricane. 
---
He has 79 (81) total casts in the entire raid (fewer than anyone). 46 are starfire, 22 are faire fire, 8 is remove curse, 2 hurricanes and a dynamite. 
---
Also I’m guessing the meme is good.
---
my Hunter alt is now level 11, &amp; I don't know where to go for info other than WoWhead . . . help, please???
---
Very interesting combo indeed, how much damage does it do if you use full t2?
---
I re rolled PVE also
---
Probably a better option as you can avoid any mistakes you made the first time around
---
A tank with Rag?
---
Are you using steam link or something similar? Or have a new mouse? 
---
I had to plug in an old mouse on to my desktop whilst my new mouse and kB was plugged into my steam link. 
---
Was strange.

They would have to be in a group together with them to get a summon

Hi, /u/Shiveron

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxl701/suggestion_to_relieve_the_zerg_fest/). 
---
1-20 is very quick and the zones you level in are uncontested.
---
You can duo or solo quest to 20 in an evening at most. 
---
I wouldn't recommend boosting dungeons cause that takes roughly an hour per level. You can achieve that or faster via questing and if you want to go quicker slap some movement speed buffs.
---
no. its not. that some swing timer resets (its not additional swings) is not worth the dps difference, and in addition CHT has great stats on top.
---
i'd say pick up CHT if no one else needs it as blue MH replace.
---
Don't think so because fade only temporarily reduces aggro and when it finishes it's right back where it started.
---
what usually happens with bg's is that the efficient honor farm is with a premade, so the faction that has a long queue (usually horde) take there 10 or 15 man group and go roam the same zones that are pvp heavy already to get in as much honor as possible.
---
Yup. When the honour update dropped I immdiately flew to Hillsbrad and it was the most fun I've had in this game. Multiple 40 man raids with the raid leaders co-ordinating manoeuvres, learning when to retreat and fall back and when to charge, getting pushed into TM and pushing all the way into Southshore docks...
---
Sure at first I kept dying but then I learned how to hold the line, positioning, how to push with the raid, etc. Most people I suspect just charge in, die in a few seconds or spam AoE's senselessly and then go online and complain that large scale wpvp sucks.
---
Same. I am level 39 and I have been booted near MC mid flight. It was funny though

People need to lower their expectations a little. You can't start playing an old-school mmo and expect to have everything handed to you. You will get destroyed my no-lifers in pvp, and that is the way it should be in Vanilla. 
---
I don't play WoW much either. I know I won't stand a chance against premades, I know that I won't get to do Naxxramas, and I know that once T3 is out I will get one-shot by PoM-Pyro mages, but that is Vanilla. If I cared that much about those things, I would've chosen another game.
---
&gt;dps in a simulation based off a spreadsheet is nothing. A double hit proc from sword spec is better than no OH proc with a dagger.
---
try classicsim  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9rt7hc/introducing\_classicsim/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9rt7hc/introducing_classicsim/)
---
You have to add CHT manually for now, but that is fairly easy.
---
I'm realizing that a lot of what I liked about vanilla PvP was built on people being really bad at the game.
---
For example, back in vanilla it was *extremely* rare that people would be carrying every single consumable or weird item in their bags for PvP. Now it's fairly common, particularly for duels. This has had the weird effect of homogenizing classes — where now it feels like half the abilities people are using are these items that everyone has.
---
Also, now that people are decent at the game so it's more likely 1v1s are between people of an okay base level, the RNG in a lot of fights is *way* more apparent. A ton of duels basically come down to who crits first. I didn't really notice this before because it was so rare to actually encounter people who were remotely good at PvP in vanilla.
---
Anyway, it's the same problem with world PvP now. People weren't generally knowledgeable enough about the game to think about how to min/max Honor during the world PvP phase of the system back in vanilla. They are now, and it's ruined world PvP.
---
55 now and decided dungeons are more fun than corpse running.
---
Yea, they come off as dickheads. OP is awful on top.
---
This, you want the buff but don’t want the heals.

The guilds I’m in made a second raid group and both clear mc quickly. We felt the need to do it because of the amount of people we had who needed spots. We are at a spot now where we have some more people who want to raid (5-10) and it’s unfortunate because we don’t plan on setting up a third raid group. If you enjoy the people you play with and see progression for a possible second raid.. I would stick around. It sounds like it’s probably not a priority though. I would try and join a guild that is just getting into MC or looking for core members where you can learn with some of the others while you progress

&gt; I have all my pre-raid BiS and am attuned
---
I mean, yeah. This game is primarily about level progression then gear progression.
---
You're saying you've reached the max level and gathered the best gear you can (outside of raiding). There's not much else to do other than that, for now you've completed all the content the game has really.
---
Need to try that, cheers
---
I am raiding on 30fps. It is possible. Not beautiful. But possible.
---
Walk into your guild and ask to see the manager. Thats how I did it in my day.
---
Do you think Pshero couldn’t do this with any class or any race? 
---
Christ shut up
---
Was leveling an alt yesterday in hillsbrad. Literally a group of 60s chasing after a level 37 paladin on their epic mounts. Never seem anything more pathetic lol
---
This subreddit is filled with complaint posts, but I'm happy that at least somebody enjoys it.
---
While farming instances for gold I need to have my alt to be able to reset. Every time I’ve been logged out for a while I have to redo the process of finding someone to help me invite my alt to a group.
---
Can I keep the group while logged out over the night in some way?
---
Why would anyone care about clearing raids that can be done by 20 people and 50s. There are literally 0 retail guilds even giving a fuck about classic raiding.
---
+ idd retail guilds wouldn't win cuz all these speedruns are purely about experience. There is no skill involvement just 10 years of Pserver knowledge. Gratz very impressive.
---
as current raid content is fairly easy, that should not be a problem. But with a weak spec on purpose you should go full buffed all the way to show some effort.
---
This may change with P3
---
You might need glasses or new glasses?
---
Agree man completely. Late 50s I kinda understand. But 48? Like come on man, get a life.
---
It’s only been 3 days people why don’t you get the hell outta our servers if you’re already tilted.
---
Silithus barely has any quests (or anything to do at all, really), right? Why are people even there?
---
He just seems like such a nice guy.
---
Have you forgotten about ventrillo and teamspeak?
---
You split the honor with the entire raid, so not really.
---
Funny. WoW players don't go to bars.
---
Periods between each word in what should be a sentence just makes you seem like an idiot.
---
So we're now on a level on this sub where paying back money you lent is newsworthy?
---
I don't think that's true
---
 Think that was added in Cata.
---
Low effort content, make a screenshot nexttime
---
The guilds that came from retail don't really care about speedrunning raids, since you get nothing out of it.
---
Caught...
---
My thoughts also.
---
Very rare and very expensive to make after you get the drop.
---
Join mirage raceway as horde! It s great, but we kind of want tanks. :)
---
Or you just bandage yourself? Mage water in between pulls and healthstone/bandage during fights is more than enough. Also, at least in my guild, we have a shaman for every melee group pumping Healing Waves for raid heals so there's only a few bosses where healers and by extension warlocks actually have to worry about mana issues.
---
Yes I’m sure you did this exact same thing
---
You sound fun
---
Are you a gnome? I said gnomes are an exception. It's your fault if you picked gnome.
---
You are missing elemental sharpening stone 👍🏾
---
Why it's obviously the best moneymaking transmute in the game, you should calculate the profit compared to which recipes you already have since transmutes share their cooldown. 
---
Let's just say you make 5g profit from doing Fire to Earth already or you could learn Undeath to Water which would make 15g instead. Then you profit 10g per day by learning it, not 15g.
---
&gt; large scale PVP is an absolutely brain dead, bottom of the barrel experience. 
---
not if you know what you are doing.
---
Yeah. This is what we were promised, no changes Vanilla experience and now we're yelling that things should be "optimized" or done "properly". This is what it was, only thing that has changed is gaming culture and people playing the game.
---
On Pyrewood Village alliance outnumber horde by probably 3:1
---
No kidding. I remember class balance being wonky, but there are so many outright op potions I don't even renember existing. Basically guarantee a win but costs few golds a pop. Now granted I was a raid healing priest back then so probably why I missed all that. Did lots of arenas in TBC and it was a lot fairer already.
---
No, but dropping your Rs is something that Bostonian English shares with pretty much all other Non-North-American English dialects.
---
Cant really do shit when 20 people pile up on you. :&lt;
---
No unfortunately not so your only option is to become part of the problem on a different server and transfer from your 70/30 server to a 30/70 server.
---
It's insane. The only option blizzard is currently offering is to make the problem worse. 
---
They need to turn layering back on and limit each layer to be fairly even then just effectively have the faction imbalance players queued in a layer where there is no opposition.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world best MC clear in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The last guy to speed clear p1. I can do whatever the fuck I want.

He's wearing his PVP gear until he's inside
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
Damn that s a lot if consumables. I m leveling a rogue and I won t be farming firewater for sure. I will bring bandages, hp pots, fr pots and mongoose. Hope it s enough lol.
---
And the reason they decided to do that with this specific guy is because he's one of the few who has a legendary hammer this early.
---
rogue set,there is nothng like that (rank 10),even for ret paladins
---
He is.

World of Warcraft Classic^(2)
---
Cancelled my subscription today. I like PVP, but when servers are as unbalanced as they are, I find no joy in the game. I get killed at flypoints seconds after landing, on boats, in neutral cities, corpse camped for hours by groups. I am a 52 NE hunter and I cannot fight back. Horde has lvl 60 elite guards protection their cross continent travel points, alliance has 40 non elite. Horde has 60%+ of the playerbase on my server. I am stuck sitting in IF with nowhere to go. Quests? Forget it. Dungeons, yeah, I get killed 10 times running to the entrance. This was it for me, Ill keep my money and sanity, and go back to other games. The nostalgia was good while it lasted, but I am to old for wasting my time like this. I am not 16 anymore.
---
It certainly also depends on the gear. Mages and rogues have such a great amount of control that they can dominate early on in crap gear, because they simply dont get hit often and they are still very strong later on.
---
Warlocks with a good purse also want ZG to release  so they can get their hands on LIPs which arent out yet.
---
Warlocks really become overpowered around BWL/R13 gear and they are pretty much unkillable world bosses once AQ40 comes out.
---
Helllllno. Oeh wie, I get to fight a paladin and a warrior for the 83rd time in a row. What a blessing!
---
no, you're wrong... boomer

Guessing that having the quest hub in the very top corner of the zone would hvae made questing a pain in the arse, moving move does help that slightly.
---
air?
---
I really do enjoy all the bitching, crying and moaning about ninja looters and scammers.
---
Like, blizzard made the changes necessary in patches and updates required to get rid of them.
---
RL money scammers? WoW tokens.
---
Ninja looters? First it was class only who could hit need, then they just got rid of need/roll entirely.
---
That's the world of warcraft that you play (yeah yeah yeah yeah). do not cry when shit doesn't go your way or because blizzard wont ban a dude. lol
---
This person wasn’t even trying to fight you until they were a fair bit below 50% health lmao
---
Yesterday a priest whispered me something like “I know this is annoying but pls could you make me some water I really appreciate it” so I’m like “ofc mate”!
---
I used Evo and PoM to make water fast and gave him 6 stacks, maxed out the trade capacity. Then he trades me back and gives me a rune of portals and said “org pls”. I laughed by how rude that was but I did it. However next time I’ll take it and leave.
---
Over the course of a few hours I made approx 2k water and food,while i watched movies, and gave it out for free in IF. Got my biggest tip of 7g at the end when I was just randomly trading people to get rid of my stock.
---
Haha WHAT
---
Yes! Thank you bud
---
just because classic is popular, doesn't mean they give a shit about clearing some faceroll raid from 15 years ago
---
What am I missing bud?
---
There is clearly interest in speedrunning old games, why would WoW be any different?
---
Defo not needed as it’s so easy
---
Method as a guild isn’t playing classic. Some of their retail players play it casually and they have hired a couple streamers for their organization, of course they’re not going to accomplish anything of note.
---
Alternatively, get yourself or a mate in on said raids and go kill civilians
---
&gt; PVE servers still have wpvp, the only difference is you can opt out if you want.
---
Is there even anyone who opts in on PvE servers?
---
But that Deathbone set tho, awesome for RP!
---
Assuming aoe for auto corrected to air.
---
cries in heartseeker
---
Instead of fighting 10 vs 100 and crying about it, avoid southshore so they have noone to kill there and get bored. Instead form a 5-10 man special forces elite navy seals squad and enjoy having alot of flesh to kill in blackrock, in front of ogri and in the plaguelands. Make sure to switch locations before they respond.
---
You must play on that streamer server.
---
the problem is, spy does that for you before you even know my name or where i am. its cheating dude. you know it is/ it does that for you before you have even seen me on screen taking away the advantage of surprise. if im behind a tree and youre running down the road it basically fucking tells you im there when theres no chance your human eyes would know that or would have time to macro up.
---
Cockatiel you are a bewilderingly old DJ Spazzy Jeff!
---
I started playing on December 4th, 2004 and the game released in late November.
---
However, admittedly, I didn't reroll on a pvp server until a bit after BGs had been added, and that would make the difference I guess. Still never heard any stories of the game being unplayable for farmable level 50s before that WSG portal unlocked, but maybe I just missed it.
---
download f.lux (a program that reduces the brightness from your computer) and thus, should reduce headache.
---
Honor should have been in from the get go if they didn't want to release the BG's at the same time. That would've made things  a lot smoother and there wouldn't suddenly be full epic raids ganking lvl 48's. People would've gotten their PvP trinkets through playing the game normally and most people wouldn't care about grinding honor anymore.
---
This made me think, world was quite large for the time but with later expansions it started to feel small due to portals and flying mounts and faster movement of characters. They should have stretched everything to make it closer to real world scale. So we could all have one megaserver in the end so instead of small servers where everything is farmed and limited, we actually had more space, more resources and more quests in large zones.
---
get the thrash blade and get mirahs song.
---
After that, run whatever you like. Dal Rend MH drops are VERY rare. Going for low drop% BiS gear just sucks.
---
Full strat runs are great (cape, head, orbs, 2 shoulders, pants) and lots of money to buy some devil saurs gear.
---
Also nice Q rewards.
---
When you have decent gear, look out for a raid spot
---
Mostly Looking to play alliance faction though
---
Then why not have a Druid buff everyone before the raid and replace him with another Warrior when you enter?
---
Just official ban it? Why do people think Blizzard needs to change the code?
---
Just put it in the same category as botting. If it’s not allowed, then it will be gone.
---
So there were some balanced servers, weren't there?
---
Seems to me some alliance lost the war and went to hearthseeker etc. and now Horde gets blamed for being better at pvp.
---
no point, Theramore is right next to Tanaris
---
stop lying lmao. That's literally not how the addon works at all. You are doing something to reveal yourself. Warlocks naturally have high stealth detection with their felhunter, that was likely it.
---
ok boomer 😓
---
"If you don't like it, play on a PVE server" 
---
ok well I did...
---
Honor in raids is minimal and what you'll make 500 honor in an hour? It's already bad to the point of making little to no difference if it was there or not lol
---
join a death squad?
---
That's basically what they do tbh.
---
so this is what RP-PvP servers look like
---
So you're gonna say the removal of layering was the defining part of phase 2, not world bosses and the honor system?
---
Yea, like playing a priest in the first place
---
I sure as hell hope not... 
---
I have noticed a huge difference in the alliance population I meet while pvping. I think 3-4 weeks of this will make lots of people simply quit :/
---
No.
---
innervate.
---
Lol I'm not actually suggesting they ban people. But they do need to find a way to stop that add-on from working. If you're going to stare at your combat logs like a robot, okay fine. Probably shouldn't tell people when you go stealth outside of their vision though...
---
Dude, move to a PvE realm. It's that easy!
---
But I know you won't do that because you are the kind of person that likes to kill lower level players just to fuck with them. But when someone comes with a friend to fight with you, suddenly it's not fair anymore. 
---
So.. grow a pair or move to PvE.
---
go join a death squad and roam high level zones. Why are you not even remotely putting in any effort here? TM v.s SS isn't supposed to be an accurate representation of PVP. If you genuinely believed it wasn't going to be a zergfest, you're an idiot. That is the only WPVP place that IS a complete zerg fest.
---
And it's always someone who rolled horde for the easier time in PvP.
---
what server? my experience on Arugal so far has been horde out number alliance 4 to 1 so every zone has 20-30 horde at flight points.
---
With spy, you are able to have a really simple window open that shows the names of your nearby targets. 
---
So a soon as they come in range, you can click their name in the alert box without knowing where they are, and start attacking them. 
---
In order to do this without the add on, you have to look at the persons name in the combat log and type /tar name. This takes a significantly longer time, and may be difficult if people are using special characters or have weird spelling. 
---
On top of this, reading the chat logs is not the same as being given an alert. If you aren’t religiously following that combat log for a second, you might miss something. 
---
This is a huge difference.
---
You don't understand: In the vanilla pvp ranking system you don't compete with the other faction, you compete with your own.  
---
If you and some other guy have the same amount of honor from the BGs, but the other guy also got a good chunk of honor from ganking lowbies between queues, you'll be lower standing and thus gain less ranking points.
---
Ranking horde normally requeue, run straight into RFC after WSG and drop their group. 1 minute later they are wherever they set their hearthstone.
---
Gee, go figure. Coalition did it first years back, but I'm the crazy one. And now we have APES and Progress both utilizing the spec.
---
The wPvP has been fun as fuck and I say that as someone on Netherwind where Allies seem to outnumber us 10 to 1.
---
Reroll on PvE if you don't like it. The game is working as intended.
---
The irony is BT isn't the best, Wind Serpents are.  Wolves would be the next best.  Cats arent BiS for any end game content.
---
"But muh pvp interrupt!" You say!  Practically speaking, the difference between a 1.2 attack speed and 1.3 attack speed is negligible *at best* due to latency and batching.  I walked right into Mulgore as a level 10 night elf and tamed the Rake.  There are other pet family options at 1.3.
---
In short, people camping the Rake are wasting their time over a practically irrelevant technicality and get to enjoy the most bland and abundant pet in the game because of it.
---

---
Raid damage taken is so laughably low tapping should almost never be an issue.
---
Aww, I bet Kezan in vanilla would've been really cool. I wish they had put it in.
---
Its really interesting seeing people complain about different things and being like ahhh thats why this or that was implemented in tbc.
---
Leveling an alt now (57 ATM) that the casuals are getting higher level is pretty chill. Skill is occasionally lower (in my experience especially for the classes with loads of flexibility like shamans and mages), pace is lower and group compositions sometimes a bit weird. But if you care about having a good time while clearing the instances it's pretty nice to have a group willing to communicate and have laugh. And even though skill might be lower you will not wipe as frequently from mistakes. This game punishes impatience very hard.
---
People getting angry about not balancing something that is entirely the choice of the players is absolutely hilarious
---
There needs to be a million of these threads until something is done
---
As a lvl 60 warlock farming anything above 48+ for honor, I will be moving to bgs once they are out. Hopefully sooner rather than later unless blizzard remain ignorant.  
---
PS: I'm not murdering &lt;47 I'm a kind warlock..... unless you're a gnome then i'll think about it.
---
Your friend has a level 60 and a level 50 in only ~90 hours of /played?
---
Horseshit
---
Our main tank got fully decked only a week back and is one of the best geared tanks on the server. There's still plenty of items that melee and ranged dps are waiting for, and same for casters and dps.
---
Dat backpedal doe
---
4 real, dude is flexing how much g he wastes each week lol
---
I have nearly 300 HK's right now and I think mine is around 13k honor. Small groups ftw
---
Too damn many tryhards. 
---
Vanilla was alot superior to classic. But I'm glad I get to relive it as it almost was the same. But times have changed.
---
weird, all addons up to date.
---
What ever happened it’s pretty fucked, not a lot they can do about it other than fix the bug though.
---
Because the difficulty is something else?
---
It's about speed runs, big scale PvP fights (where alliance wins 100% of the time if on equal skill because of Paladins BoP on Mages) and coordinating 40/80 people?
---
Lowest wages are just the beginning.
---
Haven't seen this done before, not even in vanilla. This should be a new thing done more often as a story to world pvp. One side captures one or more players from the other faction and hold them hostage via MC in some place, while the other side tries to rescue them.
---
Unfortunately this happens a lot. Your guild probably isnt trying to be assholes, but once raid groups get their rosters settled we tend to like seeing the same people every week. It builds trust, we have to explain less, and often our loot systems are tied to it.
---
You have the option of leaving or recruiting. If you like your guild and want a second raid group go do dungeons and get people you liked running with into your guild, explain to the officers youd like to help with that
---
Thrash mh vanq oh until you get mirah's song. Bloodrazor is a noob trap weapon. Thrash blade is the best mh until zeal/krol.

Dont start. You Will get addicted. You Will be less social. In 3-5 years you Will regret starting
---
Every town is bigger than it is in-game.
---
Yes, absolutely it will be completely filled with premades.
---
It's even somewhere in the chat options, where you can join global channels such that looking for group.
---
For sure man. My server is pretty even but still have to deal with the roaming death squads of mages with a paladin to BoF them. Can be frustrating at times but that’s the game. 
---
I just don’t like it when people put blame on the person just trying to play their way. It’s an MMO that gives a lot of freedom and I think being a dick is a way to exercise that freedom regardless of if I agree with the behavior. It’s what makes classic great imo. 
---
There’s no protection against toxic players, and if you want to protect yourself you have to become stronger and eventually corpse camp then. I love that and I go on Reddit and someone acts like I’m an asshole because I have a fundamental disagreement about MMO’s than them. 
---
And yea cheers mate enjoy the easy honor.
---
No, you're underestimating it greatly.
---
Have the rando promote your alt to party leader. You should stay grouped with your alt while it is offline; just don't boot it from the party.
---
I knew Rogues were cooldown dependent, but not to this extent. If I take any fight without every single cooldown available I'm effectively just a stealth mob.
---
It automates using your fucking eyes mate. Hiding in a house?
---
That's fun. Always nice to meet a future resto druid.
---
That's a silly logic. I'd rather just see seperate rankings for horde and alliance. There's 2 faction specific classes. We're not invalidating logs using them. If faction specific buffs is enough to invalidate, just seperate them.
---
You wouldn't want a scale world. 3 months travel of not a lot to go from STV to Arathi
---
This is what I do when I'm doing organized PvP with guildies, but discussing how to effectively get honor was not the point of this post - was really looking to discuss my other comment regarding server-locked battle-grounds pre-phase three as a possible way to incentivize horde to transfer from Skeram/Stalagg to Heartseeker.
---
I'm 53, undead rogue on a fairly even server.. I just decided to stay away from searing gorge and un'goro. I'll try western plaguelands, but if its bad there too, i'll spend some time finally getting up my fishing and cooking. I've been pushing that aside for a while.
---
Hopefully when im done with that, it might have died down abit.
---
No you said shield wall which is irrelevant to crits, he simply tried to correct you.
---
 I was doing the same thing, when they resist I always started to move and vanish afterwards. Well the secret to it, is when they resist or they start to hit you, YOU do NOT MOVE AT ALL and vanish on your spot of resist. I repeat , do not move at all and vanish, this works out for me 10/10 I can say,  ever since i've noticed this I have not left BRD for 5 days now, doing pickpocket routes all day.
---
I'm sorry am I missing something? I play horde on rattlegore and the alliance players do all of this as well.
---
"how to PvP proper"
---
Id argue premade 5 man is playing it proper. Maybe partner up with people around your level?
---
I expressed a similar sentiment in my guild chat. I think I said, “phase 2 hasn’t been fun so far.” 
---
Instantly a crew of “guild mates” decided, without a question or any conversation, the meaning of that statement and every nuance it could hold and told me: 
---
1) Go back to retail
---
2) roll on a pve server
---
3) you think you did but you didn’t
---
4) if I’m a pve player why don’t I play another game
---
In fact, I pretty much only play WoW for the pvp, and the only reason the other stuff in game has meaning for me is to make me stronger in pvp. I just don’t like the situation that op describes.
---
Why do you insult me for stating my opinion?! Grow up
---
They are also way too populated. 30-70 13 years ago was fine since you just never met that 70% very often.
---
a bit sad that progress is dodging gehennas
---
Cross realm doesn't help if nearly every PvP realm has way more horde. Horde will have very long queues, there's no way around that now.
---
As a hunter you should be beating rogues with your eyes closed.
---
Druid tank here, I use all these + 1 MCP per boss, don't know how you can realistically keep aggro at this stage in P2 without them. Unless your DPS is low / slowing down for threat
---
Seriously? Isn’t that superduper OP for horde? What’s the ally alternative?
---
Of course the Eye drops too... wtf
---
It's also different cause the class design and balance is locked to one of the latest patches. Warriors for example were quite a bit different down the fury tree at the start of vanilla.
---
O K B O O M E R
---
As a healer, i'd like our warlock to stop tap my mana to regen theirs è\_é
---
It's impossible to "ban" an addon without restricting the API, if it's possible to gather info of sorrounding players from the combat log, then the spy addon will always exist.
---
If a tank tries to sunder while EA is up, the sunder doesn't cast and they get the error message "a more powerful spell is already on the target".
---
What are you on about? Classic is pretty easy anyway, hell no class is hard in pve. Most have a simple rotation.
---
But can’t Blizz just pull Ally from PvE realms to fill the BG queue?
---
Seen MH drop twice, lost it once to three-way and the 2nd time to the tank who wasnt supposed to need on it. Last week lost brutality blade to the only non-orc warr in raid. No vis’kags yet.
---
Basically, if you're not already the GM or main tank of your servers top guild, there is next to no chance you will obtain it.  So by default, merely asking which mounts are obtainable means that you're not a contender.
---
And every trader out there have bank vaults full of twink items.
---
I sadly cant help you, as i am not the warrior playing in this video - but instead suffering as a caster.

However, if you're lucky you might be able to catch the guy playing here!  [https://www.twitch.tv/pinju1](https://www.twitch.tv/pinju1)
---
I’m not 100% sure but I thought blue PvP gear doesn’t come out till a later phase. The only gear out atm is the epic class sets.
---
You haven’t seen people do it on stream.
---
They're lying.
---
So the horde either can queue or reroll alliance/ transfer to alliance heavy server . 
---
Let not kid yourselves, people picked horde for one sole reason - zerging over alliance. If they want to enjoy that then they need to wait.
---
Dreadmist. We're something like 55% horde iirc, so horde players are visibly more numerous, but not to the extent where it's impossible to fight through.
---
Okay so
---
+ Nobody can really tell how popular classic is, I agree  classic for sure has a larger playerbase than retail but since it all falls under one sub, no real point in arguing about player numbers
---
+ Classic guilds have taken over? Taken over what exactly. This sub? Yeah it's the classic wow sub. There is simply no world 1st race in classic because the content isn't ..well.. new.
---
+ They aren't playing classic though, sure individually, but not as a collective going for world firsts.
---
It's not possible. You definitely did not see them chat with each other.
---
no you!
---
Non-raid-member player-cast buffs are removed when engaging bosses. Or so I'm told.  
---
Hordes can try it by getting mind controlled and paladin buffed.
---
&gt;looking to jump straight into a pvp server 
---
You better go Horde, then
---
&gt; Wow Classic+ Classic
---
There s mobs you can farm, yeah buts not even a fraction as effective as mage for example and you d make way more mining or herbing.
---
Today I learned

really ? :O
---
Don't use what? Spy? I don't care about it if you actually read my posts. I'm giving people the alternative.
---
It only took me 40 mins to get to ubrs today from kargath, not long at all, loving the vanilla experience.
---
Cue the "invite to PvP layer" spam
---
Too bad most of it sucks for pve. Keep farming the ah for +shadow dmg greens until p3.
---
Thanks for laying out the detailed thought process
---
Being vastly overpowered is not amazing class design. Nor is having a one spell rotation.
---
If you're looking for alliance then Druids and Paladins are the least played. Druids aren't that sought after but are great flag carriers in WSG if PvP is what you're after.
---
Paladins on the other hand are overpowered healers who can do all 3 specs well on the way to 60 and when you're there you can be the best PvP/PvE healer (along with priests) or a good 5man tank. Everybody will want you. You will see now that guilds have started forming and recruiting for raids- everybody wants a Paladin.
---
Be warned though, Paladins are as boring to level as people say. Depending on your personal taste you might find the experience even more boring.
---
I didn’t even argue in favor of his point. I was just pointing out that you were being intentionally obtuse.
---
Don't play a PvP server. 
---
You're going to get shit on for fun by groups of people you can do nothing against and when you get to 60 you'll need to spend a lot of time running back to your corpse. I mean a LOT of time. Sometimes it can take 20-30mins just to get to a dungeon that's a 3 minute walk. Unless you have free time and want to inconvenience other people in the same way.
---
Make sure you take into consideration your class choice and how you want to play. Just because a Paladin can hold a big two handed mace doesn't mean he can do the same damage as a warrior.
---
I would consider a healing class for your first choice since healing is a much more forgiving role. Druid is good thanks to it's stealth in world PvP. Just be prepared to be a shit version of every other class at 60 though.
---
calling other dickheads and then post this good god
---
He means yelling the odd weird string that translates to a phrase for the other faction..
---
OP wants us to do their simple google search for them.
---
Be careful. Report &gt; Cheating. In the comment type "bypassing faction chat filter" and the exact message like O K B O O M E R. It will get flagged automatically and their is a high chance of you getting a 1 week suspension when a service desk employee reviews the reports and decides not to unflag it.
---
ok compromise, battlegrounds for christmas but instead of bonus weekends disabled all battleground weekends
---
Fun fact, the coffee taste comes from roasted unmalted barley.. no coffee is added, and the difference between a stout and porter is the unmalted barley. Most porters use a little bit but mainly malted barley. Stouts generally are higher in ABV, a typical American stout is around 7%
---
Well, what did you attempt to do to overcome this?
---
I realize that it's no longer possible to level quite the same way it was before p2, I'm just not seeing at as a necessarily bad thing. Yeah, it's all around harder, slower and with higher odds of getting stonewalled alltogether, but that players have to figure out solutions and collaborate instead of silently rushing along questing addon optimal paths like bots makes me feel it might be worth it.
---
Stuff like that would only ever be possible with direct modification of MPQ files. If anyone is old enough to remember, a guild called Overrated actually removed the floor at the start of AQ40 and fell down into C'thun's room to skip the entire dungeon.
---
If I remember correctly, the entire guild got permabanned from that action.
---
4.5K honor is pretty low for hours of grinding. That’s only like 130 kills for a 3 man group maximum. 
---
Best honor farm is either soloing hillsbrad outskirts or dot spamming hillsbrad from what I’ve seen. Do not join the raid, it’s shit honor. Just sit alone or in a group with a healer/another person doing the same thing you are.
---
lol I always just find enchanters that don't charge an arm and a leg to do and enchant or wait for a guildie. And yes normal guilds do not charge for an enchant or expect to be tipped. If someones taking tips sure ill use em and tip for their time since its my mats. If someones charging I move on and find someone that isn't.
---
In this first week, literally nothing. Dishonorable kills are an immediate subtraction of your current rank points. However, rank points are only earned at the end of the week, meaning nobody has any right now.
---
Mostly people are just panicking about DK's because next week they will actually be bad, and a lot of people just don't want to ever get one because it looks nice, I guess.
---
I don't think he understood that it's only various signs and letters that translate into short "messages" for the opposing faction.
---
thats not an addon You ignorant oaf, its a string of inputs on a macro.
---
My experience in Felwood was 11 deaths running from the flight point to emerald sanctuary lmao
---
The worst is the mage that gives you one stack of water.  Lack of knowledge and experience
---
The realm is unplayable. I expect it to be dead very soon if blizzard doesn’t do anything fast.
---
I still use mine all the time at level 60. It's nice of you don't have a ton of other AoE.
---
Dam I actually laugh in loud
---
I have this same feeling yea.  
---
Except for the whole game.
---
Honestly, I feel bad for the alliance at this point. Went questing at 53 in Gadgetzan and there’s 60s just slaughtering people in town and having mages sheep guards/ frost nova them as they kill one alliance character than flee. This is on Kromcrush which I had always assumed was 60/40 horde at the worst. If anything as a horse player, it has made questing easier for me
---
Yea but in mmos you never truely know whats best since mechanics are weird. I can tell 10 str is better than 5 str but creating a calculator to even figure out if 1% crit is better than 10 str is incredibly complex. I wish we will move in the future towards games that rely on simple and intuitive math.  
---
This supports both sides of the spectrum. It's better for casuals who just want to enjoy the game and it's better for people who enjoy theorycrafting.
---
It was patched as a bug in patch 1.6 I think, but is possible to do now and I think it was in at least WOTLK too.
---
Spirit does nothing for warlocks.
---
Why on earth use ABV? We just use % and it's obvious that it is volume percentage, which questions why would you ever use weight percentage? Or what am I missing? Just seems like a really shitty way to use weight percentage when it is much more obvious to use volume.
---
U mad bro? Take a chill pill 8)
---
What server were you guys on?
---
Looks accurate to me.
---
You pretty much have to grind instances now so you only get farmed for honor on the way inside.
---
Weird... Where did all the anti-streamers go?
---
Excuse me but I have an enchanter, I'd personally feel like scum to ask twice the gold + YOUR mats for a recipee that was effortless to obtain and being half the value of the fee you are asking. It makes no sense and is simply greedy.
---
&gt;40/60 requirement balance.
---
No. Giving the underrepresented faction higher priority queue is one thing, but locking people out indefinitely is another.
---
Yea dude my advice to you would be to stay in your current guild and pug the raid with others. If you wind up in a pug and you think you'd be a good fit for their guild/raid team ask them to join! :D
---
Another thing I recommend is just say something when you gquit doesn't have to be much but say goodbye and thank those that were helpful. Reputation goes a long way :)
---
I already quit for the exact reason you said :( im a complete casual and getting ganked 24/7 now is boring
---
It always will be because the nature of the WoW MMO is boring. The only thing that caries it even in retail is the community aspects. BGs will not change that as much as people think it will. Either you enjoy playing the game or you do not. As with any launch the amount of people doing world PvP will taper off drastically.
---
Lol. So another mad would be ganker it is. Cry more. It automated nothing. It merely provides information.
---
My two cents? You're a stunted shut in who can't hold down a job. You talk like a silly child and I view you as one. You like to talk big but you seem incredibly small haha. Take some deep breaths and eat more vegetables.
---
Except farming honor doesn't really matter, what people want is to be able to level and move around the world without being constantly tanked. Who gives a shit about the 0.1% of players we are trying to get to rank 13?
---
this stuff actually makes all the fun. nothing worse than same stuff years and years even if it works... i'd be happy if on Retail there would be possible to defect to the other faction for insane effort that very few people would want to attempt. but it should be possible in the end, maybe not friendly but at least neutral.
---
They arent playing classic as an organised guild trying to achieve anything.
---
People comparing the accomplishment of classic content to retail content are out of their damn minds.
---
Are the downvotes enough negative reinforcement for you to stop being a twat?
---
It looks like we’re getting cross-server BGs, because of that it doesn’t seem like premade groups are gonna be an issue.
---
For The Alliance!
---
I never really see xp runs advertised, and the one time I did they were only killing trash (?). Is that normal? I thought it was strange.
---
6% is kind of low. Give me a 10-12% tripple.
---
I am having no fun ganking people coming out of instances. I am not having fun getting ganked in my faction camps.
---
I’m guessing you are in the raid groups, not trying to quest.
---
I don’t hear anyone loving the experience of getting farmed or griefed all day.
---
Yes it existed and so did addons like spy
---
I found it quite amusing when EU players were flaunting about how streamers are going to ruin NA servers completely and the biggest streamer can barely even control his own server.
---
I can’t wait for them to encounter &lt;APES&gt; premades, thank god for Classic giving us NA servers.
---
So they let the servers balance themselves since launch and now we should create more ques on top of what we already have and fuck server logins once again. That is the worst idea I have every heard.
---
If they made it so premade groups only face other premades it wouldn't be that bad
---
So, how much gear does he got so far, compared to others?
---
The AH addons can’t automatically buy for you. You still have to click the item and click buyout.
---
I think more relevant is the FF with a billion melee.
---
You knew how it'd be. Learn to deal with it or go to a different server, care bear.
---
Pride in being able to survive a fireball from ony without a greater fire resist pot.
---
Zug Zug
---
Sounds like you've already got good enough reasons to do what you already want :)
---
&gt;  I don't care about it 
---
But do you use it?
---
I agree. Thats why I am always super happy to find shadow wrath gear, because someone is willing to pay tons more then I'd spend on it.
---
There is a lot of discussion right now about how 10 player groups of 60s farming 50s is either very lame or very cool.
---
I think we know immediately whether every single person commenting is playing one of the 60s or one of the 50s
---
Nah, I've seen some swifty pvp videos but Indalamar was THE warrior - he was around way before swifty became a thing (at least to me).  He was even hired buy Blizz for itemization.
---
I'm not saying every rogue complains or even minds, just that 100% of those who do complain are rogues lol.
---
I hate wpvp and love this addon. It has saved me a lot of time.
---
every time someone does a post complaining about spy it gains 100 users. good job spreading the word
---
No, it shouldn't
---
I thought it was 110%?
---
I cleared BRD too, upvotes to the left.
---
Honestly what actually bothers me is the very high likelihood that the people calling others morons etc are likely to lack intellect and intuition elsewhere in life. No sense of humility.
---
I see people complain on this sub all the time about circlejerking etc but are these theatrics really any different.
---
Even less sympathy if the pvp server is Herod
---
Imagine advertising an authentic football game, and when you show up there are 88 players on the field.
---
I don't look forward to playing WoW any more after this recent patch. It's a clusterfuck of timewasting and there is no way to opt out besides not logging in in the first place. Anywhere close to a town should be an automatic pvp-disable. Anywhere close to a dungeon should be an automatic pvp-disable. You can pvp if you want to by turning it on, but it's literally ruining the game as it stands.
---
Why wasn't i suprised that you rolled a horde wl ...
---
Its not about the fact that wpvp happens. Its about the fact that almost every server is 70:30 in favor of horde. This is so bad that many players quit already because you can't level at all.
---
I got a 51 human warrior on my server and decided to play on another server all together and roll horde because every flightmaster was camped by 40 man horde raids to farm honor. Zones are overrun with 5man grps farming lower levels in all 48+ zones.
---
Blizzard needs to balance out factions/give out free transfers.
---
People having a blast are in raidgroups and enjoy the game.
---
World pvp lol. You mean world griefing.
---
World pvp will still be around, it’s the griefing parties bgs will take out.
---
In vanilla these fights were often random groups of sub-60 players, which was much more enjoyable and made more sense.
---
Was in Vanilla from the get go, back then there was a lot less complaining going on (except about the dying hamsters)
---
Players now are more comparing with retail and the cookie cutter that has become, so they tend to complain a lot more.
---
A single DK can easily wipe out 5-6 hours of farming honor. If you get one while pushing higher ranks (11+ or something like that) you can basically already give up for the week if you get one.
---
No can do. All my friends are on a pvp server.
---
It's a copypasta
---
Pff the microwave man is always complaining
---
Thought about a priest maybe.
---
Call in your group and chase them...
---
I'm sure someone bitched about everything back then, they just didn't have a platform like Reddit to do it constantly. They had to go to websites and discussion boards to complain, not gripe from their phones while waiting for their latte at Starbucks.
---
doesn't work.
---
Imagine if instead of having a Rez timer when you’re getting spawn killed, we get to Rez and have that amount of time to be non pvp flagged, then we would actually maybe be able to make it to an instance to continue playing the game. 
---
As a lvl 52 alliance on Gehennas, the game is absolutely unplayable. :(
---
I don't think vanilla and classic can be compared anymore. In vanilla, fun meant playing your race/class fantasy and enjoying content. In classic fun means min/maxing the shit out of everything and being no1 at what you do.
---
Dude, you really should stop acting high and mighty because you had a group to quest in felwood.
---
It will work against Ragnaros (and only Ragnaros) in MC, but only if you or one of the other mages procs frostbite and you get your cast off within the batch that the freeze gets broken.
---
Lol what? This is completely uninformed and baseless bullshit
---
*laughs in unique-equipped*
---
I rerolled hored because alliance is pretty much dead on skeram. Kinda sucks leveling again but the questing areas, citys and flight paths are so much better on the horde side.
---
Golemagg, are u also thinking the same ? We moved to earthshaker, and it feels much better. Even tho its not a full server, but it’s getting populated!
---
I have heard people make this claim. I know BGs will be cross realm but how will that stop premades? Even a good 5 stack can ruin a casual's WSG.
---
Good luck if your horde, human warriors pop perception as soon as you pop up on Spy and will instantly find you.
---
You're remembering right, they got tired of clearing everything and used a little shortcut, got the ole banhammer. It was a cool idea though. Think they only had to kill the first boss and were able to clip through the floor to C'Thun.
---
no idea what exactly you are so worked up about, classic and retail are two different things
---
Fuk yeh you sexy beast.
---
To expand what another poster said, there are two enemy factions in WoW (Horde and Alliance). Usually, the only interaction you can make against someone in the enemy faction is to attack them. 
---
However, one class in the game can use the ability “Mind Control” which allows the player to steal you character and control them for one minute. The character who cast mind control stands still during the spell duration. 
---
So we are seeing a big group of people chain abilities together to keep the mind control going. The distance they ran this guy probably took 35-40 minutes of chained mind controls. THEN when they reached the big city they messed up and allowed the mind control to fall off which flagged the horde as an enemy again and he was attacked and killed by NPC guards. They were so close to the king and thought hope was lost. 
---
BUT! When someone is mind controlled you can heal them and do other things as though they are in your faction. A warlock from this group had given the prisoner a Soulstone which can be used to revive a dead character. The prisoner was having as much fun as everyone else so THEY USED THE SOULSTONE!
---
Honestly, the most impressive part of the whole vid was them lining up so quickly at the end after a single suggestion by the leader. This group has played and practiced together so much they react to their leader like a marching band. This is a large group of friends making memories.
---
192 hours in 2.5 months barely playing the game? How out of touch with reality are you?
---
It’s long long long past that dude we’re not even remotely close to no changes that is clearly not their goal.
---
Heartseeker Horde isn't outnumbered "as bad as Stalagg", it is actually very close to twice as one-sided. \[Check it out\]( [https://imgur.com/a/rQlSbhW](https://imgur.com/a/rQlSbhW) )
---
They're going for authenticity
---
How do you do the Lyceum?  We disbanded there because our tank thought we had to run to a pyre as soon as the torch was looted.  And we didn’t have any AoE, so this strategy obviously can’t work.
---
Not if you’re on a pvp server.
---
On my server Horde took Everlook and we’re killing all nearby alliance. We put together a ragtag group of maybe 25 - half of what they had - to take it back.
---
We didn’t succeed but we care close! It was so much fun
---
R.I.P
---
Overreacting much? 
---
Not even a week has passed since pvp got enabled and you people go crazy, calling for changes.
---
Shit, you're right. Oh well, guess I'll head down there tonight and only get one.
---
It makes me proud that this is in my city. :D
---
First half of username checks out
---
Im new to Reddit and I can't seem to find how to check trending communitys.Can some one help?
---
Fire res potion for Ony fireballs? What am I even reading?
---
Remorseless attacks in the assassination tree is really good for levelling. I'd pick 2 points in it asap. Otherwise go combat, precision and getting riposte is really great. I wouldn't bother with weapon specializations until you are max level, so you are more flexible with your weapon choices.
---
By level 42 your talents could look similar to this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZG0EkbVz0fo
---
Then I'd go down the Assassination tree to something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMesoxZG0EkbVz0fo
---
As for weapons you always want something slow (with high damage) in your mainhand so your sinister strikes hit harder and something fast in your offhand, for more poisons.
---
At max level you want to respec to what you want to play, depending on weapon type (swords or daggers) and content type (PvE or PvP)
---
I watched the entire thing and there was tons of funny stuff in the video?
---
Krol Blade is not trash.. yes compared to raid weapons it's not good. But it is pre bis if you dont wanna farm Dal'Rend MH which can be a huge pain.
---
watch everyone be a premade player all of sudden just like everyone on retail is a pro m+ player
---
Getting your first shoulders and long cape is a milestone for every character
---
Heartseeker Horde isn't outnumbered "as bad as Stalagg", it is actually very close to twice as one-sided. [Check it out](https://imgur.com/a/rQlSbhW). Heartseeker is the most lopsided server in all of classic wow (well actually there's a China server that is a little worse but I can't tell you the name)
---
In vanilla not everyone was so die hard try hard. Classic wow was not designed to cater to these people. Hell people ran around in whatever gear they wanted and didnt really know shit, that what made things balanced. 
---
Now everyone exactly everything.
---
When will ranks be given? Just want rank 3 to buy my mount with a discount lol
---
I’m on Whitemane right now and I’m having a blast.
---
Shouldn’t have transferred or picked a server that wasn’t on the original list 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
What dungeons, and how do you even find groups? I find myself spending like 1 hour just getting a decent group, and ofc now the entire black rock mountain is a warzone.
---
I saw mostly them shitting on Banana squad or whatever the name is.
---
I mean if that's super funny to you I guess good on ya?
---
Oh of course. That makes sense. Like an extra swing kinda.
---
Indeed rip.
---
I hate wpvp, that's why I rolled pve. It's funny how so many people willingly forgot about the misery of griefing and ganking that was, is, and always will be part of the PVP wow experience. There is no difference from 2006, everyone is just older and not capable of putting up with the same bullshit they did when they were 20 (or whatever age you were when you first played)
---
Sounds like Herod
---
Why? Because my phone autocorrected it to the Swedish word? Since im Swedish. Using a Swedish phone?
---
I usually just chugg one pre-battle. Is less stressful for the heals.  
---
Also phase 3 has tons of fire damage if you happen to get feared into it.
---
You're a mage. You spam blizzard. Real high IQ stuff.
---
Solid display of Bubblehearth. Paladins ftw
---
You are offering a service and when the customer found out how much you charge he told you no thanks. You could have just moved on with your life but you chose to try and talk down to him? Were you expecting him to realize the error of his ways and come crawling to you with 3g in his outstretched palm? Can you imagine if you were at a restaurant and the cook acted that way towards you?
---
Also, if you aren't streaming yourself playing the game, then you're doing it wrong.
---
Props for being a raid ready tank - anyone wants to cry about a tank being as prepared as possible for a raid can fuck themselves.
---
&gt;ad hominem
---
Get over yourself. An insult is an insult and this isn't some high stakes philosophical debate.
---
My point is not that it stops premades, but it makes it less likely to play against a good one.
---
I'm sorry i did what Blizzard was begging people to do?
---
Mate, I’m not sure if you missed SALAD BAKERS video that this is a response to, but that’s literally what they did
---
But you also don't get honor
---
Thats why tbc and arrnas were better at pvp than classic
---
the more often the ban waves happen, the less bots will get banned, as it will give the bot creators more info on how the bot is being detected.
---
Lol I mean like a full run. Like as a PVE player my group could enter the raid as you start your attempts to get in, we would be done at the same time you manage to finally enter
---
can we pin this message please.
---
That’s some heavy Ready Player One type shit
---
wPvP is a myth. The only 3 options for it are wall of armies that spam Aoe as you stand around bored. Getting rolled by 20 man squads or rolling people in your 20 man squad.  My guild has stopped bothering to wait and heas out as a 5 man, it doesn't matter because every flight point has 20+ horde camping it. Then it's just a 40 min corpse hop to the dungeon we want to do.
---
This needs to get more visibility. Vanish is 100% bugged. This seems to happen a lot in BRD, making pick pocket farming unnecessarily annoying.
---
When should I pvp trinket vs rogues? Is it straight when they open or if they wanna gauge reset, or the 2nd stun?
---
Is cats eye elixir + googgles good? A lot of times there are rogues camping in IF and I’d like to fk em
---
Join &lt;Frens&gt;
---
Should’ve been smarter when picking your server 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Honestly wish I rolled on Faerlina there are tons of alliance on there that are probably real easy pickings
---
what is wrong with you. why can't you just accept someone elses point of view? lol
---
What's a good area to grind solely with mobs at 55?
---
Get a group together and death squad it up.
---
I understand all that and yet people are on here bitching about being ganked and outnumbered, surely these people knew beforehand that this would happen and its just a case of if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen, or don't enter the kitchen in the first place.
---
Also replying to long messages on my phone is a pain in the arse, I can't see what I'm typing.
---
I have noticed the same with Feign Death, I have to stand still a small amount of time before, have pet on passive and feign. Now it works a lot better for me.
---
Youlll get over it
---
You mean dying as soon as you land everywhere you go? It’s a blast. I love being FP camped everywhere I go. Yesterday I was only able to tag two mobs in Jadefire Run in 40 minutes. Then miraculously I was able to get a full sweep of the area before any more horde showed back up to camp the spot. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m ready for BGs.
---
Sure, and I feel for ya, but what's wrong with having tangible consequences for players to realize what happens when no one ever wants to change for the sake of server health and instead just rely on Blizzard to come to the rescue somehow?
---
And why should content drops be tailored for the status of some servers? By that logic, should phase 2 have been delayed indefinitely to avoid queues on overpopulated servers?
---
And what's to say that battlegrounds will even prove to be a decent substitute if the ratios are already bad across a multitude of servers?
---
What's a good way to track when world buffs are going on my server? Like Onyxia and Rend world buffs. Is there an addon that can track it?
---
Nah, Horde attracts that type of players. It's literally like 80/20. I've played horde and alliance across different servers and various pservers and the experience is consistent. Horde bitch and complain about Alliance players whilst receiving 1/10th of the assholery.
---
Gankfests which have been in the game and well documented for 15 years.
---
Ext.
---
Word?! Thanks(:
---
Everyone I go in Herod is alliance dominated. Horde don’t group up.
---
Alliance roll around in raids with healers.
---
Noggenfogger Horde here, I always try and seek out a fair fight but some people bring it on themselves. 
---
I was hanging out in STV last night leaving Ally lowbies well enough alone, but as soon as there were enough of em they jumped me 4v1, luckily some back up showed up. 
---
Then there were all the 60s ganking on the Boat/Zeppelin making it impossible for people to enter or leave STV.  
---
Can’t always play the victims. I’m now a lot more likely to kill on sight rather than leave people be. 
---
Ganking breeds Gankers.
---
Good choice, Psychic Scream and Silence are pretty damn powerful if you play PvP.  Their healing is AMAZING and their shield is good crutch for when things go south.
---
They are not on Firemaw.
---
The difference is that DBM provides information that is constant IE a boss does the same thing every time, but Spy provides informstion that can be used for ganking on defenseless players and gsining advantage on them.
---

Whitemane is currently 60% Horde, I'm sure you're definitely having a blast when you outnumber then 3 to 2.
---
Reroll RP sever lol. It’s quite simple
---
Just pulled every mob separately and worked out way in
---
I like this. I think it's probably better to kill world pvp before it gets old (for more than the people who already cant stand it at least).
---
Yeah, how dare people want to be able to play the game and not just be cannon fodder for the stupidly imbalanced faction on almost every fucking server.  Horde better be careful what they wish for cause when all the alliance quit because they cant do anything you are going to bitching about 4 hour BG queues
---
*By people with horde flares who call you a pussy in the first 4 words
---
Well, stumbling onto 5 to 6 bots in a zone isn't a good thing either. Nor is finding them at the same spot 3 days later.
---
This should be higher up
---
No cuz I can take rezz sickness and go to a different zone. You don't gotta be stubborn and force yourself to stay in that zone they're in. You can always come back to that quest or dungeon when they're gone.
---
I wish I rolled Alliance honestly. My own faction annoys the fuck out of me.
---
Such a lie. That event didn‘t exist back then. One had to parse complete strings with half the infornation we have now. Spy addons existed but they were harmless compared to spy.
---
Right.  It's 100% vs Any%. Horde% it is.
---
Depends on which class you are and if you're in a PvP spec or not. Druid will get shafted by an Arms Warrior but can auto attack a Fury Warrior to death atm. :P
---
In terms of PvE they're basically budget healers, you're always better with a Priest, Shaman or a Paladin.
---
Deathdealer's Breastplate and Cadaverious Armor are 2 very good options before SGC
---
I play on a PVE server, so maybe my opinion means nothing.
---
But massive world PVP is more of a spectacle then actual PVP.
---
It’s a mosh pit of lag and color orgy.  At least in Tarren Mills, 2 distinct sides with just a wall of blizzards and rain of fires.  Maybe a rogue can get cheeky solo kills off on the sides.  The goofy fuckin palladins who think the can push the lines with a bubble run.  Most people just try their best not to stand out, stay in the pack, and the only people who die are the ones who believe it possible to try and 1v1 or 1v2.  It’s not possible, because you’re hit with 50+ insta cast damage spells the second you are within range of the opposing red ocean.
---
Bring on BGs baby.
---
k, now land in any fligh point as the outnumbered faction and go to an instance portal
---
As someone who was against this style of world pvp chaos, I've actually really liked it and I've learned to adapt as alliance on a horde dominated server. Yes, common areas like brm are a pain to get in to, but overall I've learned to adapt and it's not all zerg pvp.
---
100% 
---
Classic has brought out the no lifers who dominate the server. I wake up early and would find people farming popular spots at 4am everyday. 
---
Every 1v1 in world pvp, if you can even find it, is engineering and pots
---
BGs will be 100x worse
---
I think classic isn’t the game for me really
---
This shit is happening on my server and we are pretty evenly split.
---
People are being serious little bitches.
---
Elegantly stated
---
Hi, /u/Shuckle-Man
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxmmic/if_battlegrounds_dont_come_by_december_its_time/). 
---
and yet another example of a piece of human trash. call me salty all you want,but at least im not considered the scum of the earth. bully any people in real life lately? because THAT IS WHAT U ARE. a bully, someone who deserves to be  arrested for harrashment and thrown in jail. because at the end of the day you do absoultely nothing worthwhile for human,YOU ARE A TRASH HUMAN BEING.
---
No, that is not how things work. It's impossible for the game to "search" you files like that. What they have to do is to restrict certain information that is passed to  COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED event, which is what spy uses to log events.
---
Go to any of their websites, you can easily look at the faction split...
---
What you didn't take into account was that record was a solo 1-60 record. The start of classic was nothing but warrior cleave / Aoe dungeon farms where in the 30+ area you could rack in 50-80k exp a hour and once you hit the 37+ range and got a party of ravager warrior with a shaman it was a even bigger joke. you could hop in and out of dungeon groups in a few minutes at a time and yes obviously he didn't have a parental lock on his computer limiting him to exactly 1 hour of play time a day I am sure he had days off where he played a bit more then just 1.
---
However the point stands do you really want the game balanced and patched around people who play it that little? if it took 3 months to hit 51 if I remember correct its something like 1-45 is the same total exp as 46-60. Should phase one really last until march 2020 so you have another 3 months to hit 60 then a month or two in order to farm out some pre raid / raid BiS gear so you are then ready for phase 2?
---
I mean you have a point. Druids are okayish at dueling. Oh and farming! But thats about it.
---
r/classicwow was #1 for a few days right before and right after the game  launched.
---
In part. But its also a general notion of having a city be both a quest hub and an area to complete those quests.
---
It’s a pvp server
---
Lmao you're exaggerating so hard. Of course you'll be able to rank. Probably not rank 14, God No.. but you'll be able to attain SOME ranks.
---
OP plays melee.
---
you too hopefully
---
To be fair.. alot of idiots use I instead of y. Guess I'm the idiot this time. Heh sorry mate
---
Are the greater fight prot potion for like oh shit moments or do you drink one prior to pulling to give healers a better chance to react?
---
How dare you bring logic in.  This is reddit!
---
Don’t play a PVP server.
---
For me it's that I'm playing in one a very huge fantasy universe where both factions can do the same (except shaman/paladin but that fits the lore). In one faction you can play a human, blue human, small human and tiny human. In the other faction you can play an undead, troll, orc or Tauren.
---
Ahh that makes sense. I thought the same thing from the normal side of the world  /s
---
It's not the rest of our faults you rolled on a shit server.
---
One of the most important skills of any dps is to adjust to the tank's threat level. Any idiot can just hit their ideal rotation in order and ignore what's going on around them. There's a skill in realising that you have a weaker tank and adjusting your play accordingly.
---
That's a balanced server, mate.   Most are 70/30 or worse.  3 to 2 is a pipe dream for some
---
lmao you are a fucking n00blet did you start two days ago? fuckin n00b loser lmao how can you really be this stupid
---
Yea but who has more fun lol, in all seriousness though, since phase 2 BRM is mostly horde controlled.  Idk where the alliance at, apparently at LHC
---
And? Its a safe zone. The first two zones of a PvP server function like normal servers.
---
I believe it’s just because the game has been played in the past. So many years have come by and people and streamers have figured out the most *effective* way to everything. Example, people didn’t dungeon grind with a warrior 3 mages and a priest back in the day. 60 came fast, raids are very basic and easy compared to the content and fight mechanics that are in today’s WoW. But that’s just because back then everything was new, no one knew how the hell the onyxia was supposed to be fought. But now we all have so many reps and experience with raiding and mechanics that the content is cleared much much faster.
---
Wait really? So PvE servers you can just flag yourself? Not sure why I didn’t realize this ha.
---
til
---
1. Blizzard fucked up server balance by offering free transfers that werent faction locked for WAY too long. Because of THIS specific fuckup, early BG's are the best answer now.
---
2. BG's are cross-server confirmed so it will solve problems even on faction imbalanced servers.
---
https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php
---
Thanks for this, learned a lot
---
The whole game is just boring for me sadly. I really want to play it but I've already cancelled my sub. I think I have 5 days left now.
---
picture in picture movies off netflix/hulu
---
sub spec, add in coffers and boss kills for RNG fun.
---
Only do it for an hour or two at a time.
---
Its funny how fast people become memes
---
It’s just new and everyone is going crazy, it’ll feel a lot better in smaller groups when the novelty wears off
---
Dreadmist alliance also, had some really good skirmishes and won some big fights in places. The main difficulty is the random small groups of neckbeards camping the lower level areas.
---
If feel like modern gaming culture ruins every game. So many people trying to do as much as possible while playing as little as possible with as little challenge as possible. When even classic WoW gets partly ruined (I still enjoy my leveling and raiding) I lose all hope of falling in love with an MMO again, hopefully I'm wrong.
---
Only seven. Seems there’s a shortage.
---
Horde dominate PvP servers.
---
PvP players that want to play Horde will always have to deal with a queue.
---
No, I don't think so. After a certain amount of time of everyone being logged out, the party disbands.
---
I’d say it’s blizzard’s fault for allowing the lesser populated faction to transfer off server. Server balance was fine until they offered transfers and alliance characters abandoned the server. They should’ve restricted transfers from the get go. I chose Herod as it was guaranteed to be a populated server as it was being claimed as the non-streamer server. I played on Elune back in the day and I know how it feels to be on a dead server. Faction imbalance is definitely better than having a dead server.
---
Or just dark pact for dungeons and have infinite mana without pissing off the healer
---
If you're pushing ranks you really don't want to gain any DK, ever. There isn't really a hard number for how much 1 DK is worth in HK, since the amount of rank points you earn isn't based on HK, but on honor with respect to the rest of your faction, divided into brackets. 2-4 DK's are probably about the equivalent of being put in one lower rank bracket in the end of the week, if I had to make a wild guess. Simply put, if you get ~3 DK's in a week, you may just be completely incapable of achieving R14, no matter time spent.
---
Main thing changing is the faction that (rightfully) cries about faction imbalance. There's a sense of schadenfreude that the Horde players claiming everything was alright, having fun stomping the other faction by greatly outnumbering them, will be the ones stuck in 20-30 minute battleground queues while Alliance can join the second they queue.
---
I never said that... buddy.
---
I probably have more /played as alli than horde (retail ofc) and experience the same issues on both sides. I’ve played on multiple realms as well. The people who complain about one side always being assholes are the ones who rarely/never play the opposing faction.
---
Don’t even think about trying Scarlet Subterfuge...
---
With world buffs and consumes they should already be at crit cap
---
Very well-written explanation. Thanks you.
---
I'd gladly play alliance with 4:1 H/A ratio. 
---
Leave your Hillsbrad zergfest and go roam in the world.
---
I personally dread battle grounds.
---
Alot of people will join them, and the server will feel a little more empty. 
---
Bots become a thing, more prevalently.
---
Premades are a thing, and on unbalanced server this could make bgs unplayable for solo ques.
---
From the last point: are they server only, or cross server? Some server population statistics show signs of extremely long que times.
---
People will do bgs, with the hopes of gear. When the reality of what it takes to get Grand Marshall sets in, people will burn out.
---
Also, if I am not mistaken, you cannot que for bgs in major cities at launch. You have to goto the battleground entrance.
---
Grats!!
---
The issue is that you can’t level any char 40+ right now.
---
I wanted to lvl in Tanaris, but Gadgetzan is in comlete Horde control. They just killed every NPC and when you land there, there are 10 hords killing you instantly. Then when I revive inside Gadgetzan, again 10 inside killing anybody. Additionally there are like 5-10 constantly running around the city to kill anybody whos leaving. Oh yeah and don’t even try to get into ZF lol.
---
And btw I love PvP and also wPvP. But for me that means I fight other people in my lvl area in that zone. But what I just described is done by 20-40 lvl 60 people. This is just boring and I don’t even know why they do it, because they do not even earn honor like that and get dish kills in Gadget...
---
Ultimately this will make many people leave the game I think. And yeah often you hear „oh play on PvE“ and shit like that, but that‘s not the point. If you aren’t 60 right now, it‘s a complete shitshow.
---
"create a toon on a pve server" thats what ganking trash always says,and thats how retail got warmode.  its going to be a self fulllingly prophecy on classic because u dumb asses cant help yourself.
---
personally hope classic's pvp servers run themselves into their own grave,because u ganking trash will deserve each and every bit of it. say what u want about retail warmode,but it was a breathe of freshair after feeling the urge to throw each and every ganker off a bridge for over a decade.
---
...So while the rogue is moving away, you turn around and start moving away as well.
---
You can't "deadzone" a warrior unless you can somehow read their mind and know exactly when and where they're going to move.
---
If you experience burning for more than 10 seconds get the hell out of the fire puddle.
---
Warriors wrecked face in vanilla, you guys are remembering some other game. Every high warlord was a warrior on my two servers
---
Nope, faerie fire.
---
Fun means whatever is fun for you. No one else decide what is fun for you right?
---
I don’t see it. As a Horde I get shit on all day by Alliance.
---
Probably the undead zones yeah
---
*kiss kiss*
---
cant you just play the game as you like it? you dont have to do what others enjoy atleast if you dont enjoy it urself..
---
I can't imagine playing the game now under 60, and honestly, wPvP really isn't as fun as I remembered either.
---
Yes, sure mate. Everyone will be facing a top premade every time they do a BG.
---
Just reroll horde and then all the pvp on pvp server people will be fucked cus no one plays ally
---
Im pretty sure pagel is still alliance dominated. Not that it matters much on a pve server.
---
I just made a mage for the first time. Do talents like elemental precision benefit my wand(shoot) skill? Mainly wondering if I need to focus on finding a frost/fire wand as I level.
---
As a Caster you are so fucked right now. This ID I had 39% Shadowbolt Crit at Magmadar and I barely made Top10! Melees have way better Consumables, Ony Buff is better for them and as a Caster you barely get any Spellhit.
---
It's mathematically impossible bullshit. The greatest of all varieties of bullshit.
---
I'm on Herod and haven't left Ironforge since P2. I plan on raid-logging until P3.
---
Horrible example. i was running around Skeram in both Plaguelands last night and there were just as many if not MORE Alliance. Everyone died a lot and pretty sure Horde were getting their asses handed to them because Alliance had an organized raid.
---
Seriously...got back to retail
---
You do realise there have been *many* changes to the game compared to vanilla... right?
---
You don't actually think this is the same game do you?
---
Crit cap for warriors is like 40% not sure about rogues
---
&gt; This is the only one that you won't be able to go back to and experience the same thing again 
---
Good riddance tbh    
---
imho world pvp in wow only works when there is no reward incentive besides the inherent dynamic of killing others for reasons you see fit. Fighting over quest mobs, spawns, nodes or territory is how it should be. Thats a meaningful encounter. Grinding other players for honor like mobs is an incredibly ridiculous concept and should be buried forever.
---
Yes, that is Blizzard's fault. But you should have known better than to expect Blizzard to do something intelligent. I am sorry for your troubles, but the writing was on the wall.
---
Itll be calmed down once BGs start.... that isnt for a LONG time unless they decide to say screw the schedule and release them early.
---
Why are you so butthurt? I never claimed it wasn’t going to be a zergfest. I just didn’t expect it to be so unfun. Fuck off back to your basement buddy.
---
If alliance had shamans...
---
Feel free to take the free transfer to another server
---
vanilla was 2 years.
---
tbc came out shortly after 2 years
---
Not 👏 everyone 👏 is 👏 60!

I'm so tired of being given this advice when I'm just a lvl 54. And to preempt more bad advice, yes I know dungeon grinding is a thing, I've already gotten 2 levels from BRD since this shitshow started, but it sure would be nice if I could spice things up with some quests! (Not to mention several quests for prebis/ony attune are a nightmare now that I can't go anywhere without being camped for honor)
---
You don't need 40 people for a second raid if people are geared. If the main raid splits and there's a good mix of new and geared players, it's more than possible. It may be that 15 people is all you need when dividing the raids.
---
If your guild only just started raiding, it's fair that they'd want to get the main raid correct before exploring too much in to a second raid. 
---
That said, I don't think you mentioned which role you play - there's a difference between taking a new DPS and a new tank.
---
Nice. And the engineering gnomes in ironforge can't even afford one.
---
Imagine being such an idiot that you call people idiots for dhks, when dishonorable kills do nothing first week.
---
While leveling as Horde, I only got ganked when there were more Alliance than Horde once or twice. Pretty much every time I saw more Horde than Alliance in an area, the Horde would attack the Alliance. Besides that, look at tags on reddit. Most of the toxic opinions on pvp seem to come from Horde players.
---
Not what you're asking for, but here is an example of a Stance Modified Macro. It will change the tooltip and icon depending on wheat stance you're in.
---
#showtooltip
---
/startattack [harm]
---
/cast [stance:1]Retaliation;  [stance:2]Shield Wall; [stance:3]Recklessness;
---
The cat is already out of the bag and the foremast hand is already bloody. There's nothing Blizzard can do to fix the situation of faction imbalances.
---
People should have known Blizzard would be this useless.
---
My guild runs a 30man, we have since day one. Zero issues. MC is easy.
---
What about anvil accessories?
---
If pvp server roll horde
---
Yea, I know.  I’m laughing because the option is there.
---
And also, there is no reason he should be in que, so he is getting double punished.
---
In reality tho, he likely made those toons recently to bolster the weak sides numbers, so he knew what he was getting into.
---
This is completely irrelevant nonsense about "corporations". Fucking hell some of you people are insufferable. 
---
The vast majority of the people I come across in WoW have been cool. For whatever reason this sub has a fucking huge concentration of absolute fuckheads. That includes you. Stop being a cock.
---
Of course, people should have been "smarter" when picking a server. You are asking people to see the fucking future in a bid to make yourself feel superior. What a fucking twat you are.
---
Any easier way to find groups for dungeons or do I just have to spam chat?
---
Lawbringer is F
---
&gt;having the quest hub in the very top corner of the zone would hvae made questing a pain in the arse
---
It's not like it has stopped them in ungoro or ally desolace.
---
This way people wont be able to play with their friends..
---
If they ever reach a point when players can't notice bots, then problem solved itself. If not, they should just keep banning instantly.
---
I've got one but I have to hit the macro twice to get the trap to lay down.
---
Even easier than if it was realm only BGs.
---
Make alt on their server.
---
/who Player-from-the-premade
---
once they are in a BG, you queue.
---
I’ll never understand what people like about world PvP. Even in the best case scenario it’s just people standing around in the trenches
---
Small skirmishes are way better than all out battles
---
Too many of us are paranoid, even knowing that they don't matter this week, we're still afraid of getting them
---
Yep, 
---
The mages are shitheads. Warlocks are the most easily offended class though. We could do a whole thread about warlocks trying to be tank mages in dungeons, but really just being bad players.
---
My main complaint is that there aren't gaurds on the boats. I'm fine with getting ganked and will return the favir whenever I have a chance. But on my server as a 38 it's nearly impossible to travel between continents. At best you die on the boat, rez and jump and then swim in. At worst, if no one is fighting, a priest will just MC you and run you off the edge out in the ocean.
---
Im playing on a PVE server and i cant wait for BG's
---
How many hours of sleep do you get each day?
---
Yes but for server with actual balance it's a blast
---
You got ripped off.
---
Yup. Who could have guessed people are playing the game in a different way than in 2005. not only games are optimised nowadays also players changed. Aoe dungeon runs are the best example for this. Blizzard delivered what everybody wanted. Even sharding is gone and now people want blizzard to optimise the game. This mentality has brought us to bfa. Small steps but yeah..thats what happened over 15 years.
---
[Literally every person in here who want's classic+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRKP3VbI41M)
---
I am on the same situation right now.
---
Yes you are in the wrong in lots of different ways.
---
At least for Scarlet Monastery, I had good luck going there and posting in the general chat as well as lfg chat
---
Point being, while you brag about doing something only 0.01% of guilds do, you're skipping over the fact that only 0.0001% care about (or even know about) your arbitrary invented competition.
---
Your achievement is comparable to an obscure Guinness world record like "Most apples held in own mouth and cut by chainsaw in one minute". Yes that's a real thing. 
---
Still impressive though.
---
Are Shadow Meld visibility and aggro mechanics exactly the same as Stealth of the same level rogue standing still? Also would they somehow stack for a night elf rogue?
---
I already cancelled mine, literally 3 bars away from dinging 60 on my one-and-only character (human warrior). 
---
Take the next month or two off and enjoy the Xmas period, then come back when all the wpvp bullshit is over - that’s my plan at least!
---
If you asked him not to do it and he still did it then let him keep agro and die. If he complains then boot him from the group. If people refuse to learn from advice let them learn the hard way.
---
I'm having a blast with my 5man death squad, not our fault you play some shit ass meta honor farm that some streamer told you to do. Try get friends and roam, it's fun!
---
how do u zoom out that far?
---
Do mages get more uptime on killing mobs before having to rest for mana drinks? Currently made a mage and its level 10 but I have to sit down and drink every 1 or 2 kills. I assume it gets better with more intellect on gear for mana but damn.
---
Ive seen Rogues try that, you can quickstep in the other direction and get enough room to use intercept.
---
Put up a Rend (or If you have deep wounds) and hamstring.
---
Warriors can also use intimidating shout to reset the positions.
---
What kind of bots do you face that simply lets you kite them for eterity, besides that, poison does not last forever, which means eventually you’ll need to reapply it, and If you get in range, the Warrior (unless a bot) will put up bleeds and slows on you.
---
I’m not saying it won’t work, but you make it sound like it’s a solid way to deal with warriors, even though the warriors have a solid toolkit to deal with it.
---
So only less than optimal warriors will fall for it.
---
Besides, most warriors (or people in general) will be engineer, so expect a stun grenade from more people nowadays compared to vanilla.
---
There’s plenty of ways to deal with Rogues trying to kite you in all honesty
---
When I was questing in STV two lvls 60 priests were stood in Nesingwary's camp killing any alliance that came close, I guess I just had to git gud I suppose.
---
TBC wouldnt make any sense at 60, all of the math for all of the items would have to change then all of the raids would have to be adjusted, and the talent trees would have to be compressed or you just wouldn't be able to do anything useful in your secondary tree.... Like it would be easier for them to make azeroth material brand new than change TBC to 60
---
Blizzard fucked up this phase the moment they set classic servers up with several times the population limits of vanilla.
---
There's no way they're going to throw all of the casual levellers under the bus just for the sake of wPVP enthusiasts. The best time to release WSG was Thursday, the next best time is now.
---
Did you try joining the LFG chat instead of just general?
---
Stop changing the timeline.. no changes
---
That’s what people like though, the small skirmishes or 1v1s while leveling or a fight over a thorium vein or black lotus
---
Yeah until anybody wants to wpvp and nobody is there. Or try to join BG queues and has to wait for 3 hours because there isn't enough of the other faction to actually play BGs.
---
Lol, I must have struck a nerve.
---
&gt; so overpopulated just exacerbates it.
---
What part of that did you not fucking understand.
---
Did somebody say Thunderfury
---
just got out of raid and i'm pretty surprised at the comments.  
---
Background:  
---
it was our guilds first MC run.  
---
We ran with 29 people.
---
We had no world buffs.
---
our group was predominantly hunters warlocks and rogues.
---
I didn't use a few of these - but i did use most of them.
---
P.S
---
It was our first raid - most of us were garbage geared.
---
we got 8 down in MC before running out of time - 2 wipes on baron, 1 on golemagg due to pulling the side trash mob.
---
it went well, i spent practically nothing on my consumables, as I am an alchemist, i farmed everything myself in about 3 days.
---
newly dinged, trying to get my pre-bis and gold for epic mount &gt; engineering
---
What should i spec?
---
6.1% ABV
---
What a joke.
---
In that case, don't forget to precast Blessing of Protection
---
qq
---
BGs are cross server
---
They look ugly on your honor tab tho
---
Whitemane is great we have had sizable battles at ungoro crater fp day one. We flew in as horde cause we were told it had people. Turns out 20 ally were camping it. The 15 of us died and had to escape the fp we grouped up at tanaris entrance and worked our way back. Charged in and took back the fp and then held the zone until the ally left. It was a great time.
---
Isn't there other games to play or things to do without rushing a timeline for your convinces? You are not the only one playing this game..
---
Laughed way too hard, way too early
---
That guy isn’t even an average gamer. He’s probably shit at the game but is jobless and lives in his mom’s basement so he has all the time in the world.
---
afaik, only  CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT  and  CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL seem to be the only ones which logs events from sorrounding players. Addons like [QuuSpellAlert](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-578) from 2006, used this. Though i have limited knowledge on the 1.12 client
---
&gt;so overpopulated just exacerbates it.
---
What part of that did you not fucking understand..
---
The smart ones listened when Blizzard warned everyone, on no less than three different dates, to **move away from these realms: xxx**. I was on Grobbulus. I listened. And now here I am on an amazingly accurate Vanilla-replica called DD medium-pop wPvP. The morons that stayed on Herod/Whitemane/etc are the ones bitching.
---
 Wow congrats the big man baby streamer who said he won’t complain about classic wow at all when it’s released because he’s gonna play it legit like he did back in the day isn’t happy about the SAME GAME THAT WAS RELEASED BACK IN THE DAY?
---
imagine taking pride in the extreme amount of time you spend playing a video game
---
Must have been a private server because I'm pretty sure that was never a thing.
---
as an RL blacksmith, no such thing as enough anvils.
---
Everytime HoJ drops with a hunter in group...
---
You re wrong mate.
---
Why are you so childish thst you think people who want a balanced game are Care Bears? Do you know how dumb you are looking? 
---
It’s like saying we would love to have 40v10 Alterac Valleys and anyone who complains among the 10 is a care bear. It’s just stupid and horribly short sighted.
---
Zug zug?
---
Leave it imo. You can get gear really easy now that other guilds have their people geard and there are always guilds looking for extra players. Pugs are clearing MC and Ony in under 3 hours. It's easy content to do. No point what so ever to stick it out and wait for a maybe.
---
Shadowmeld gives improved stealth on rogues/druids. Its in tooltip.
---
Isn't there other games to play or things to do without slowing a timeline for your convinces? You are not the only one playing this game.
---
Stop mindlessly following the mob raid groups and branch off with 7-10 people. We had an absolute blast yesterday.
---
Jesus
---
Man that’s sounds nice.
---
I think sundays and wends (eu) are most raid nights so just camp sw on those days.
---
Playing on Heartseeker Horde, lemme tell ya I ain't having an easy time
---
And third best is now
---
There are carebear servers for a reason. Choose wisely this day.
---
What a load of BS.
---
For world pvp, run with another rogue. All you need is a lone wolf and a vanish to get away from the Zerg of enemies near it.
---
Yes, yes we are.
---
You probably blame the government for your shitty job too
---
Thought experiment: how would you feel if blizzard had bugged the game and mobs had just stopped respawning right when you hit 48?
---
I mean sure, you can still go to dungeons, but the overworld has been picked clean. Most quests have been rendered impossible. 
---
How enthusiastic would YOU be when level 60's told you "just enjoy it man! You're never going to see something like this again!" 
---
I'm basically being told "yeah, just miss out on like 3 or 4 ZONES of content in this game you're paying for, just so some edgelords can have fun terrorizing the rest of the playerbase!" Fuck that
---
This is why I quit retail. Enjoy your 1 year of content that gets wiped by a new expansion.
---
Why do you think world pvp means 80v80?
---
You don't see the mini tornado looking animation?
---
I personally run 1.12 but I’ve always wanted to do a 1.0 or 2.0 patch that had tbc talents without the expansion. I’m sort of eager to try this alpha. It’s fun to look around but I want the earliest fully functional game possible that I can single player on.
---
Hotfix: Guard NPCs have had their Health and damage increased.
---
That's all we will likely get. It's simple and helps the issue of camping FPs/quest hubs while not interfering with WPvP.
---
If it’s anything like real vanilla - world pvp will die off massively to BGs.  Dude is right, it’s a unique phase that will go away.  If you are talking “people will still do ganks in the open world” - that is VERY different than large scale fights
---
It's not slowing it down, it's the same pace blizzard launched in 2004 and it's the same schedule they said they would release. I'm happy with what they had in mind for each phase.. 
---
Wasn't asking for more time. Asking for the time Blizzard stated they would use..
---
Maybe read before responding

https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
Earnings on Small Servers
---
    It is possible for a server to have an NR too small to support even a single Rank 14 player in a given week.
---
    If NR &lt; 250, the Rank 14 bracket will contain NR * 0.002 &lt; 0.5, rounded to 0 players. In that case, the top scoring player for the week will earn 12000 RP (top of bracket 13) rather than the usual 13000 RP.
---
    This was observed over multiple weeks, including the week ending 23-May-2006, on Muladin/H. NR for that week was estimated to be 207, and the WS=1 player earned 12000 RP.
---
    Theoretically, if a server has NR &lt; 71, then the Rank 13 bracket will also contain no players. In that case, I expect the top WS=1 player will earn 11000 RP (top of bracket 12).
---
I'd rather there be no Alliance than forcing me to quit the game because I actually cannot play vs you just getting killed a lot.
---
I 100% agree, also level 50+ are getting hunted by every pvp 60 around on pvp servers. It's forcing us out of areas and we have to accept deaths and classical long spirit walks.
---
Skeram is like 70/30 horde at the very best. Horde were literally camping SW
---
Is this the hill you choose to die on, really? So the removal of layering equals phase 2 more than the actual introduction of world bosses and the honor system? What about realms that had their layering removed 2 weeks ago? Did they enter phase 2 then, on the 12th when they experienced no changes at all, or when world bosses and honor came? Interested to hear what you have to say.
---
What’s competitive about 20 vs 1?
---
When it comes out, when they trinket blind them. It resets the fight with you in favor now as you can restealth and cheap shot again. Now being at full 5 combo points. You can then kidney or cold blood eviscerate. For stunlock fights Atleast.
---
Take a 15 min break every hour and a half. It should help.
---
#nochanges
---
You 👏 had 👏 three 👏 months! It's not our fault you are having a bad time while everyone at 60 has been waiting for content. Everyone knew exactly when phase 2 was coming. Everyone posted warnings of get max level. There was time.
---
I think the opposite will happen as time moves on with servers actually merging as players decrease.
---
Yeah the actual thing i want, which is questing and occasional 1v1 with people who also want to 1v1 with me right then is PvE with a flag, I think.
---
I really enjoyed playing PvP before because it was really fun to be honorable when I didn’t have to be, for instance by emoting challenges to people before engaging them, and letting them finish mobs and heal before fighting.
---
PvP is awesome when people are cool about it, but enough players seem more into being dicks (or unfun at least, I’m not sure that honor farming is actually a player problem if it’s incentivized, but it’s not fun) to determine the experience for everyone.
---
I don't see anything that looks like a tornado lol. Could it be due to my graphics settings maybe? I have everything maxed.
---
Thinking it would be cool to enter Gadzgetan is carebear?
---
I went from Mirage Raceway to Gadzgetan at 8am on a sunday today on my alt and died 5 times and all quest givers were dead. 
---
I guess I should just outplay these 5 lvl 60s xd
---
Well, you would care if you were stomped 1 to 5 in contested zones like most ally players are.
---
So an unfun full time job as a grind? Yeah I'm sure that's what he wants to spend the next 4 months on.
---
I guess you should have chosen a carebear server...
---
This is normal PvP for a warrior tbh. Lots of watching other people play the game.
---
Level 55 on Grob, which is supposed to be one of the more balanced servers.  Solo questing in any 50+ zone during peak hours is a fantasy. I made it all of 100 yards into WPL before getting stunlocked by a 60 rogue.  Got about 100 yards out of the flight point in Felwood and got ganked by another 60 rogue.  Winterspring is full of roving kill squads.
---
Think I'll just live in instances until BGs drop. Heck, The Outer Worlds looks fun, maybe I'll give that a shot for a while...
---
I play alliance on Gehennas and it's perfect.
---
It spells Pagter
---
Really depends on when you started playing classic to be fair. Not everyone stuck around from the very start and not everyone started day one.
---
You get to play av. It's like hillsbrad but in bg form.
---
To me, the whining, complaining, and shaming is all consistent with the desire for Classic.
---
I fully agree with you if people are asking Blizz to change this or ban people. But shaming in groups and online comments is trying to use the community and peer pressure to lead to better behavior.
---
Releasing BGs early is not rushing. They were released early in vanilla apart from BWL. If we use the same schedule they should be released late december.
---

---
Is it really?
---
Watch the guys video above. You can most definitely deadzone warrior. There is literally proof in the thread.
---
Pvp is pvp
---
Maybe more like wind swirling around you with leaves and debris. Maybe tornado was a bad description. I play on the recommended "classic" setting.
---
Get that honor boy :D
---
Spy is great for levelling
---
The microwave man knew what he signed up for.
---
If you want massive fluid pvp battles play Eve. Wow PvP have always been best as bg's and arenas
---
Not sure if you have the healers for that in this phase.  Or the dps to make that effective.  Splitting dps doesn't always have good results.
---
Im in the situation where I only played my shadow priest on alliance, and now its a Wpvp zerg. not gonna be able to level further thanks to both factions wanting pvp ranks. I was looking forward to pvp ranks. but the way its introduced sucks for those wanting to level up past level 48-50.
---
Yea. Happend to me 😥
---
Sure, kid. You're right. I don't have over 10,000 hours since 2004. I know nothing. I was never there.
---

“Beta” is one of those hysterical terms that just make other people think you are insecure about a small penis.
---
You are on a Warcraft sub on Reddit. Who do you think other users think you are? Dolph Lundgren?
---
People like you make me shake my head.
---
These "large alliance groups" that you sometimes run into are all they have. There's almost zero medium, small, or duo groups just naturally moving around in the world that are alliance.
---
Skeram is a disaster right now and as a horde player it's sad. Everywhere I go there's just a stream of endless horde part of a larger stream of horde combing every single zone. 
---
The perception you have is terrifying.
---
&gt; Just check the first page of hot
---
reddit is a terrible barometer for the state of the game.
---
I’m on my way! Got 3 T1 and Benediction! Furthest I’ve gotten with the game since vanilla.
---
Holy strawman, with logic like this it's a wonder you are employable.
---
FYI idk where you were at launch but Reddit was shit storming over mages farming layers and posting doctored pictures of players with bags filled with ACs and BLs and getting all worked up.
---
For someone that goes on and on about "documented occurrences" you clearly missed that Reddit has been overblowing every perceived "negative" aspect of the game since launch.
---
I’ve been playing classic for years on private servers and clocked over 30 days /played in classic already, didn’t buy bfa or had an active sub for years until classic came out. 
---
But if you want to play on a classic server with less population, it’s there so no reason to complain.
---
I’ve had the exact opposite experience. I’ve been playing since TBC, I use to be fairly competitive, but this time around I decide to take things slow. I’m still leveling my first classic character, a priest in the upper 40s.
---
I’ve been mowed down by 60s a few times, but nothing too annoying. It’s not like higher levels weren’t ganking people on PvP servers before P2. But there’s been a ton of small group WPvP on my server and it’s been so fun. Most people group up for bigger kill quests at this level, and so what ends up happening is you get 2-3 groups of Ally/Horde in each of the contested zones (specifically Tanaris/Blasted Lands) fighting for control of an area. 
---
If you’re a lower level and you’re out questing then it’s not a big deal because most of the big mobs of opposing faction players aren’t off the main roads, they’re at choke points, FPs, and dungeon entrances. Corse run (normally only once) to wherever you’re going or wait for them to move on before you do your turn in. 
---
At least this was my experience on Rattlegore, but I think we were one of the more balanced servers ratio-wise.
---
Being in a group of maxed players killing lowbies is no different than being on a pve server. No PvP risk, no PvP skill shown.
---
Ur cool
---
I also play with maxed settings and WF procs are quite easy to spot. Grey wind animation around your character. You can also put on text that pops up when you gain a buff.
---
He's provably well aware by this point how toxic these nolife guilds from pservers are and thats why he misses the more fun and relaxing playstyle
---
Found one of those "go to retail" spammers that jump on you 20vs1
---
World pvp is terribly boring. Skill and gear hardly factor in. You can have a strong five man, and get rolled by a random roaming raid group.
---
It's also a huge grind. In the first few days on my server, people were already at 100k honor. They weren't the best players. They just played way more. 
---
That's not fun. Wow is already a huge grind. Now we just added another grind element.
---
My favorite memories of world pvp in vanilla are actually from after battlegrounds were already released. 
---
Bring on the battlegrounds.
---
Please do! Will save much time in queue of enough ppl do this :)
---
Do you believe that there are enough heavily-dominated alliance servers to balance the number of horde-dominated servers? And how do you think it will look after months of Phase 2?
---
Now go outside and enjoy the rest of your life while doing something constructive.
---
Whether you enjoy or hate phase 2, This is the only time you gonna experience it. Let it happen and do not speak for others.
---
yes, all of them should transfer out, then the only thing you will be beating is your dick while you sit on org because all of the alliance will have transferred off the server. this 'just transfer hurr durr' is the dumbest shit i've ever heard.
---
Do you have the mental capacity of an ape?
---
Oh thats right, you literally play the ape faction, hurr durr me mudhut scum, me sinister strike from stealth, harhar.
---
No reason to argue with animals like you who for no reason. I can just google and see you are wrong.
---
Ya I’ve stopped playing. My 52 sham won’t stand a chance.
---
Good luck but I would absolutely not risk it.
---
I think they're going to make BGs cross realm which won't matter because globally there are more Horde anyways, so yeah we'll still have longer BG queues. 
---
I don't think people are going to be happy with BGs either though because there'll be way more stacked premades than there ever was in vanilla.
---
The extremely strict limitations put on players by blizzard and WCL are part of the fun though. How do you accomplish the feat the fastest without doing anything that could somehow at some point almost be considered as a possible exploit or vague subjective cheat?
---
You have to colour inside the lines. Doing that at peak efficiency is fun Imo. More fun than glitching through walls and teleporting to the end boss anyway.
---
Just leave and find another guild.
---
I think none of the transfers are working right now. I’m also stuck since yesterday.
---
Some people simply have less time and are nowhere near 60 yet and now they get fucked 24/7 by lvl60 roam squads. This has nothing to do with skill you sad nerd
---
In vanilla pve servers was a thing;)
---
But back in vanilla time there was basically nothing else to play. Everything else was shait.
---
Miks Scrolling Battle Text easily and clearly shows wf procs. I live for those huge letters telling me I've just fisted a mob with my windy weapon of ass fuckery
---
Holy shit! Wow! I had no idea. Thanks for letting me know.
---
The thing that makes world PvP great is organic battles, or getting a group of  ten or so and roaming capital cities and things like that. 
---
Farming honor like this, with overpopulated servers (relative to the original Vanilla design) stresses the system IMO and isn't as appealing, and even burdensome for others.
---
I was like but why? Armour mods? Group buffs? Then noticed the #. Apparently I am still waking up 😅
---
Jesus christ, that's harsh. Wow. Thanks for letting me know!
---
I wish i could go to a pve server, they literally cut off transfers for the minority faction and never allowed any to a pve server as far as i know? 
---
i'm not rerolling after all this time spent, i'd rather quit
---
In my experience Classic WoW has a great community! It's only this subreddit that is toxic.
---
It was toxic 25 years ago as well... it’s the way she goes
---
There is cross server bgs for all servers. Queues will depend on the supply of each faction.
---
not going to work when 9/10 servers are horde majority.
---
No he said hes horde on skeram. He has the ability to move to a server where the imbalance isnt as bad and make both skeram and his new home better
---
I can't see anything that tells me it's proccing. I can see my Hand of Justice procs, I can see my sword specialization procs, but whenever I'm running with a shaman that's using windfury I can never tell when it procs.
---
So what do you call people who act like you are right now....
---
Bait.
---
Robe of the void. But Im tailor mainly for the crit on the ZG tailor set :D
---
This isn't irony. They're not comparable.

And also, you have no clue what your talking about. My guild has Bulgarians, Czech, French, Canadian, American, British, Spanish, Norwegian, German and more and language has never once been an issue in any capacity on any content.
---
Super satisfied that I'm not playing with people from all over the world who feed neckbeards everything they ask for.
---
At least APES play the game.
---
I second the discord thing. I got 2 raid pieces and was 2-3 on the charts for two weeks, but nobody knew who I was so I didn’t get many invites or help. I got on discord and now I have a nickname, some inside jokes with our resident SPriest (because I want her raid spot!) and the guild actually likes/invites me to stuff now. People just want to relax and be social but it’s tough when we can’t hear you! Or even just responding in chat to what they say helps.
---
Alright, I'll look into that. Thanks.
---
Not in the way you're thinking.
---
But you could give somebody who has gold on your current server, that has gold on Faerlina.  Who will then trade you gold on Faerlina.
---
This method requires a lot of trust.  Blizzard won't help you.
---
But it is also legal under the Tos because you're not using any real world monetary transaction.  It's all game currency.
---
So fuck everyone that started playing after august 26th right? Its fucking a game dude, people aren't all minmaxing and starting to play the second the game launches. Hardcore pvpers already have rewards for time invested, casual or new players dont need to be mindlessly slaughtered for months constantly just for the sake of "but muh bgs in p3" timeline that already isn't even an accurate timeline of  real vanilla wow. Stop being so dense and elitist.
---
You forgot "just group up and go get yourself some honor" because fuck me for only being lvl 54 I guess...
---
I know right? It would be so fun to be shit
---
Combat Swords
---
Nice attitude, man! 
---
So sorry that a normal player didn't consider healing druids to not be viable due to a 32 buff limit.
---
Don't think so. On my lock my tooltip showed shadow wands doing stupid damage, but it didn't change at all.
---
“Classic is about the journey.”
---
“NO CHANGES!”
---
And here we are. Can’t even handle a full week of world PVP. Maybe you really do think you do but you don’t. Pathetic.
---
15/31/5
---
To shadowlands ahoy!
---
I mean if everyone posted theirs for the same price, everyone could potentially make more money.
---
No it won't people don't realize than the real problem is not the current world PVP but the number of people playing on one server. In vanilla it was possible to have only one place with world PvP other places were infrequent single encounters... This will never stop I think....
---
Edit: also with less people on the server you had a hard time getting a decent raid so people needed more time to get their epics.
---
Blizzard said no changes, they made only one (increasing the number of players per server) which affects everything else.... And I am starting to think that it's done on purpose, we can not forget that their real baby is retail....
---
Got this message trying to window jump into mc. Ended up dead in the lava below...

What a pleasent persona you must be.

You propably are the banger at parties.
---
I ran brd for Hoj 164 times. Saw it drop 2 times. I did the last 60 or so runs as duo rogue, and we both did it till we both got one. So didn't see a first Hoj till 120ish runs. Bad luck!
---
whats wrong lil'zoomer?
---
Vanilla didnt have transfers until late in its life cycle
---
Thanks for the comments! For more content follow at www.twitch.tv/luiferm
---
why would people be complaining about horde camping every fp and camping players right next to the GY and killing the fp so they cant escape? 
---
lol why are allies complaining they cant quest. just go run dungeons.
---
lol why are you complaining that horde is camping every dungeon instance, just get a bigger group to fight them off. 
---
lol why are you complaining about the horde sending in 2-3 more full raids to back up the group you finally have a fair fight with? 
---
omg my server is dead theres no allies in the open world wtf how am i supposed to get honor til bigs come out???
---
This is an art piece
---
ITT - people follow streamers to PvP servers then when they quit are stuck there and come to reddit to cry
---
He’s clearly training to be a Blacksmith Trainer.
---
Most comments I read said that honorless targets would not be attacked that much, there are some comments in this thread that repeat that fallacy.
---
I expected to get abused by the hunter on the roof in Darkshire. I expected there to be a couple griefers here and there. I did not expect 10-20 Horde killing every single person who lands AND the flight master, AND camping the gy so that it takes an hour, 12 deaths, to walk 50 feet. In level 40-50 zones. 
---
This didn’t happen in Vanilla and I don’t think many expected so many horde to waste their time camping honorless alliance.
---
I think they made a mistake by opening less servers, but bigger servers.
---
I kinda stopped leveling as a lvl 41 mage...Even trying to quest is next to impossible....there's always a bunch of rogues waiting somewhere
---
Nou
---
It's just a visual glitch. Spell damage doesn't affect wand damage and the tool tip is incorrect.
---
I'm in Netherwind, and while the population feels balanced overall it can still suck. There was a gang of 60s rolling around Searing Gorge killing every player they saw; it took me like three or four deaths just to get away from Thorium Point after landing. They were there for *hours,* spamming "Go tO rE taIL" or whatever every time they got a kill. It was really difficult to get any of the quests done.
---
But then I mention what's happening on gchat, and another player must have too. I see the group start coming at me. I prepare to get ganked, when a group of my faction comes running up from the side. War ensues. I run into the fray. I get a piece of a few players. I die, some of the Horde die, some of the Alliance die. I res, and the cycle continues.
---
I can see why some people are regretting rolling on a PvP server at this point, especially on unbalanced realms. Getting corpse camped sucks, and getting attacked in neutral cities or when you're trying to get into an instance after you spent the last hour on LFG sucks. But it can be so much fun, too. The tension in Gadget, when there's an even amount from each faction and a single stray right click will dissolve the fragile peace, is amazing.
---
So, point being, it's not all bad. I do think Blizzard should give players who truly made a mistake by rolling PvP a limited opportunity to transfer to PvE, as I'm sure it can really ruin peoples' fun. It's taken me two months of casual weekend play just to get to 50, so rerolling on a different server where I can't even bring some of my hard earned gold with me is out of the question.
---
But, again, it's not all bad.
---
If there were 10 more servers at launch there would just be 10 more empty servers right now.
---
I don’t really know this from personal experience but I remember something from a YouTube video where they were saying very few mobs have shadow resistance. Maybe that would account for the difference?
---
Who goes out of their way to smell their chair
---
They have never been as bad as they are now.  How do i know this? The faction only server transfers are the first time ever that blizzard has done something relating to faction balance.  Why did they do that? Because it was so bad that alliance were leaving and making it even worse.
---
Also stop lying. I play on whitemane alliance.  A server with about a 60/40. There is no small scale pvp to be had. Every flight point is camped with 20 horde. Every instance has 20 horde outside.  The island to get Aqual Quintessence had at least 15 just hanging out when i went there friday night. 5v5 fights don't exist.
---
I had to do my Rhok'Delar quest.  It has NOT been even remotely fun. Also most of the "PvP" is a group of few people zerging solo players(or sometimes entire raids). I just had to waste 10 minutes getting out of Light Hopes Chapel in WPL.
---
Who goes out of their way to smell their chair?
---
I rolled PvP in vanilla and normal this time because after doing a lot of world PvP in Vanilla/TBC I came to this conclusion:  It was easy to make yourself on the "winning" side of world PvP, but everything you do is to enrage, frustrate and punish someone else.  There are usually only two possible outcomes with world PvP, you end up being a victim or an asshole.  With neither of these options appealing to me, there was no upside to being on a PvP server. 
---
Some people want to be assholes.  For them, there's PvP servers.  For the rest of us, there's normal servers. 
---
Of course, the exception to this is when someone ambushes you and you win.  Those moments are goddamn amazing and almost make it worth rolling PvP.  Almost.
---
New age medicine in a nutshell, am I right
---
Phase 2 will lead to a decrease in players and 9 3 will lead to an increase. It prob wont stay more popular for long.
---
Stopping people who want to play from playing when you have the capability to let them play is the quickest way to get cancelled subs. It’s shit being the underrepresented faction on a server, but servers will die very quickly when only 30% of the overpopulated faction can get on because the other side aren’t playing much today.
---
I swear I don't mean to be "that guy "
---
But what did you expect on a PvP server?
---
It's definitely why I rolled pve
---

Its not the same game dude. People didn't roam around in raid groups at level 60 in the first 3 months of Wow being released looking for every single shred of honor they could farm. Adapting to current times is necessary for the game to succeed. Your original wow timeline vision is asking for classic wow to fail.
---
I feel like people in this thread have never put anything on the AH...never had this happen before?
---
This guy gets it!
---
Reset is Tuesday. Also, you only get honor the 4th time you kill someone.
---
Yep, i mean look at your post - downvoted to oblivion for literally stating a FACT.
---
But it is a reflection of the state of discussion.
---
No one thinks that’s enjoyable. Straw man
---
You're clearly on a lower pop server.
---
who are you fuckin people
---
WPVP is a blast, it forces me to group together to get shit done
---
This^ basically. We have nothing else to do and our eyes all light up when the warlocks tap!!! Haha 😂
---
Brd
---
It’s average
---
This. 
---
I was playing on Vanilla before TBC on a PvP server and it was nothing like this. Servers were smaller (high pop on Vanilla =/= high pop on Classic) so you didn’t encounter 5-man enemy groups every 1 minute.
---
Noggenfogger eu
---
His point is that it's not a surprise that the game is like this right now.  If you found yourself in the minority on a PvP server, you have no one else to blame for your choices.
---
You’d be happy to sit in a three hour queue when there is plenty of capacity on the servers, but the other side aren’t playing much today so you’re not allowed to log on? I’m paying for a service and it’s I can’t use it because some other people also aren’t using it today. No thanks.
---
Imagine having your twitch handle being your username and bitching about wow
---
Why don't you ignore the shitpost? Getting baited never ends well.
---
Yeah I was a part of a SS raid for an hour or so for shits and gigs. But I can't finish hitting 60 atm, so im leveling a warrior atm.
---
the fact that you think thats all mages do tells me alot about you level of competence.
---
With the huge imbalance on most servers you basically are forced into picking horde. 
---
World PvP exists for horde, and unless you are grouped with a few folks only ganking exists for alliance.
---
Yeah it sucks having to take a break just because blizz wont even out the servers or offer swaps. They should just que the Horde on full servers and let the alliance go in full.
---
Although my server has no queues but everything is dead due to Horde, can't quest or get anywhere, everything's a mess. I can't help but think they want this, so everyone quits and goes back to BFA.
---
I came here to look for this. I put in a ticket. I'm stuck on 2hour 19 min since about 24hrs ago. Trying to go from faerlina to earthfury. Decided I am casual! 4 hour q last night at 11 still.
---
Literally a part of the human condition as far as I can tell. Even our tensions in society rn can be conceptualized as problems of the commons - intellectual property (our intellectual commons), ecology (obviously our environmental commons), biogenetics (the commons of our DNA - what we share that makes us human), our economic commons (the commons of production, which is entirely a collective effort - there are no billionaires without society's roads, basic level of education, etc.)
---
Just think it's funny the same logic applies here, in a fantasy game.
---
Haha, this is the epitome of self delusion.  "I don't do everything i can to farm honour so I'm somehow *better* than those people that do".  Okay mate, they're just playing the system as designed.  The system incentivizes you to kill anything green+ so to hate on people literally playing the game as designed is very strange.
---
I'm in herod too. Yesterday I went to both ungoro, felwood, winterspring and they all had pretty even ally/horde fighting. Ally was actually winning in ungoro
---
I think this is the dumbest response I've ever gotten, gl with that
---
There has been world pvp since WoW came out in the early 2000s and there have been crybaby whiners the entire time. Just get good and stop the crying.
---
If it dies off, then it means there just aren't all that many people who like this sort of braindead gameplay, ganking lowbies in a 40 man raid. Hence it probably should die.
---
But when you say "die off" you mean it'll revert back to people fighting because they feel like fighting, not because it's the best way to rank up. You know, the way it was before phase 2, except now you get a small reward for it too.
---
And people will still very much do wPvP while waiting in queue for BGs, anyway.
---
If you’re OOM by the time the fight ends, it doesn’t matter what’s efficient or not. As you can drink right back up to full before everyone is looted and topped off (top them off with renew to give you more drink time) 
---
It’s not a question of “is this efficient or good to do?” Because we all know it isn’t. But honestly, there’s nothing else to do at this point so why the hell not? Haha 😂
---
I haven't been able to login in America for 3 days now…

Are you asking me? Of course I've been undercut before.
---
There has been a 80-100 per side fight 12-16h/day on my server at SS/TM. The myth of PvP servers being a place of "l33t skillz" makes me go O'rly ganking is skill?
---
You sound like the leader of the nerd army...
---
There should be faction specific queues
---
On a server with a 65/35 ally/horde split, Ally have turned Blackrock Mountain into an honor farm. Being horde at this point means being resigned that getting a group into BRD is at least a half hour affair  with a lot of corpse runs if you land in Korgath.
---
Oh, you landed in thorium point? You fool.  You're being streamed and camped as some famous ally rogues literally make cash money streaming your deaths for their viewers pleasure.  You're their loot pinata and you're not getting away easily. 
---
Let's give these pvpers a box to go play in, I'm just trying to level here.
---
Seems like a lot of people consider anything less than peak nost as dead.
---
This is why I quit ^_^
---
I never wanted to roll on a pvp server to begin with. I was more or less strong armed by IRL friends that I enjoy playing with. I'm not particularly good at pvp, and I don't enjoy world pvp. Phase 2 is my personal hell.
---
Yeah but if you clean it regularly enough surely theres no need to go out of your way to sniff it?
---
Furthermore, unless you're not washing your ass on a regular basis I dont see how a chair would begin to smell?
---
it was not, is not &amp; will not be balanced, and care bears need to play on a pve server (pick horde or alliance) if you think that blizzard is somehow gonna fix an issue players created, your mistaken.
---
Yeah, the recommendations for the HotS are trash. It’s telling me R1 renew, no thanks. Toss max rank hots on tanks, and DR’d ones on clothies to top them off after AoE (if they didn’t get Flash Healed first)
---
Did you play vanilla? I am casual yes but this is not the PvP vanilla experience I had. Servers are way to big. Especially with the imbalances. Flightpath camping for 2 months with completely kill servers. People will stop playing. People defending this don't seem to understand that. It will be a PvE server practically.
---
Then you level slow as shit. 4 hours a night is hardcore level playing.
---
If that's all you can say then I can see why you resort to short random comments.
---
What is raging about pointing out the flaws in the 3 rogues? It's obvious they played terribly. They lost a 3v1.
---
Or his guild could leave too. Plenty of guilds have taken advantage of the free transfers
---
Is issues with the game are people already know how to play it and everything is moving at a faster pace than before, road done way quicker, level 60 in way less time. Not because the game is different but because people know what they should be doing already, people already know what gear is best without theory crafting and testing that needs to take place when a game is new, people have a general idea what is good is new games but it needs putting to the test to min max. People know how the game is likely to play out before it happens, allowing players to find the most optimal strategy, farm the best places, PvP in the best areas. Because everybody is doing what is likely optimal everybody know where lowbies for easy honor are likely to be, people know where big battles will likely go down, people  know big groups will be around so being a big group is beneficial to them now. Horde camping a flight path it hits world chat immediately and the mass response is sent out. Alliance camping back rock bam world chat knows and a Raif is formed to deal with it. I believe a lot of the issues are down too people wanting to recreate epic moments that happened in vanilla by forcing it to happen rather than it be natural or spontaneously so fights are forced in large numbers for epic moments. 
---
I never payed vanilla or wow in general but I know what I should be doing, I know what gear I need, I know where they come from and I know what is optimal for my class to use. All because it is at my finger tips on the internet, 
---
I do believe it will die down over time as people get bored of big groups. 
---
As a level 53 it has been hella frustrating to level higher but I have not had as much fun for a long time playing any game, fighting for control of lights hope chapel when I want to hand in a quest nearby, keeping the horde away for a while, running away from level 60s trying to kill  me and just hitting them with a goblin rocket helm hopping on the mount and running like hell. Ganking level 56-58 players in the hopes I can get something from it. Killing a level 57 who ganked me when he was 2/3 health and I was full. 
---
All those moment felt awesome to me I just went with the flow of what was happening around me I feel the reason I am enjoying it so much is through the frustration and saltiness it is feeling rewarding, I am gaining honor from helping to control lights hope chapel. Getting so close to level 60.
---
Yep... it’ll settle down eventually. I’ve been aoe farming in duskwood on my mage. I did get 2 hks there cuz an ud mage showed up for some reason.
---
You do know that Europeans are pretty well-versed in English, right? Even more so than many native Americans... Lol.
---
Talk about a moot statement.
---
People be salty when the real advice comes out.
---
This sounds worse than I thought. All the hardcore players just using their time to corpse camp. It's gonna continue driving away those casual players who can't even progress or do anything in the later levels.
---
Are you me, lol? I loved flipping a gank in PvP. I also loved going out of my way to be honorable, like emoting challenges at someone and letting them heal before attacking. It’s why I don’t want to go to PVE, but the current PvP game might incentivize assholes to an unplayable degree.
---
You understand that if this continues like this there will be no world PvP, since the outnumbered faction is just going to reroll on another server or just outright quit the game. There is better things to do than being corpse camped 24/7
---
Not sure as a Druid, but priests can get that pretty easily. True faith and benediction sure help though (like 150 right there)
---
Not in my guild. 
---
We running content as it comes and going into stuff with as little knowledge as possible. 
---
Fuck playing a 15 yo MMO to 'be the best'
---
It doesn't bother me because you've already shown your opinion to be worthless.
---
Deadzoning has been around for over a decade and was absolutely the most effective way to deal with a warrior for over 3 expansions. Get your head out of your ass.
---
My fears have been realized. Not 1 of us are playing. Life is just too busy/different to play a game like wow. 
---
Personally I want to take a good stab at it once my gf finally boots up the computer I built for her but we will see what happens when that time comes. If I share classic wow with anyone I want it to be with her.
---
So arenas takes less skill than 40v40 wpvp or just premade stomping randoms?
---
Y’all wanted classic wow! Can’t really complain about it because that’s how it goes tbh.
---
A lot of idiots also mistake 'alot' for an actual word.
---
45 people and all their sub level 40 alts
---
Right. I see loads of people saying there are no good arguments against it, but from a business perspective, denying paying subscribers access to the case when you have server capacity to let them play is absolutely insane. It will literally never happen for this reason. Imagine making a reservation at a restaurant, paying a deposit and then arriving to be told you can’t come in even though they are only 50% full, and you can’t have a refund on your deposit.
---
Gehennas is infested with twitch thots riding the classic hype-train to destination fame-whore.

You bet they dodged. Why didn't you?

And then you guys do the very thing you wanted to flee.
---
I hit 53 last night on my Priest, right under 8 days played. Friday I was ganked/camped for over 30 deaths in Ungoro and yesterday I ended up just running Mara/ST and respeccing to Holy.
---
Nope, nothing should be released early.
---

All you have to do is sheep him at that point and it looks like there was a bit of sheeping.

Sounds like your psychiatrist is failing you. Hope things get better for you soon. Best of luck out there. There will always be people better than you and with more friends willing to make you feel in adequate. 
---
At least in this case it's just PvP in classic WoW. If I had to guess though, you encounter this situation fairly often IRL as well. Hence all the posts to League of Legends and WoW subs. The escape is just a coping mechanism and when it fails for you there too you can't handle it.
---
I think the issue he was describing was # of servers before launch. There were like... 7.
---
You’re right, so teach them or do party chat with your fellow healers during the downtime. If you have mousovers, Mc is BORRRING, so you’ve all got time to figure it out. 
---
Honestly, they probably know it isn’t effective or efficient but it doesn’t matter right now so they might not care.
---
Its not boring imo. Its just a fad at the moment. People are doing WPvP in excess while A. There are no BGs and B. Honor has just come in giving pvp purpose. 
---
Once this fad wears off and bgs are in i think Wpvp will become more like it was in vanilla. That being more sparse and therefore more exciting when it happens. 
---
At the moment its just happening everywhere, which is understandable.
---
Dungeonlevel, Im leveling my alt lock atm, wont step out of brd until 60 hah
---
What bothers me about large scale  wpvp is that organized groups basically just load up on sapper charges. It’s boring to me to sit there and wait until someone calls for the moment they drop sappers.
---
Outer Worlds is absolutely fantastic. Go enjoy it!
---
Unless blizzard is about to turn guards into raid bosses it wouldnt matter.
---
Queues currently exist because the servers aren’t capable of providing a stable experience for an infinite number of players. What is being discussed here is implementing queues even when there is plenty of available server capacity. You’re expecting a company to deny its customers a service they have already paid for when they are perfectly capable of providing that service.
---
They could use only positive incentive instead of prohibition.
---
Boom. I have just changed your mind.
---
Lashers were nerfed during vanilla.
---
Downvoted.
---
They gave us a schedule.
---
Why break it because some of the player base has no-lifed the game. 
---
There are many players not even close to 60 yet too.
---
What will we do after P6 when nothing else is going to be new.
---
When battlegrounds drop, world pvp will be about 95% solo drive-by gankings, and 5% people fighting over nodes or herbs.  I play on a pve server because that was my experience playing on pvp servers in vanilla and on private servers.
---
Same... I've had lots fun with world pvp (holy priest) with healing massive raids in hillsbrad and BRM then went off on my own to farm demonic runes/felcloth in jadefire run and had even more fun with several 1 v 1 duels and small skirmishes against a shitty combat rogue and some warlocks.  I guess I can see how it would suck to be a lowbie but I'm really enjoying this phase. There is incentive to wpvp now.
---
so what if releasing the actual fun parts of the game make it end faster. world pvp sucks. mc and ony are the easiest raids in existence and once you're done with 5man content theres basically nothing productive left to do except log in once a week to raid. releasing BGs isnt going to hurt the experience of the slower players who arent at that stage yet, in fact it will improve their experience by reducing the 60s trying to gank them. and for those of us who ARE at the level where theres almost nothing left to do, it gives us actually fun, endlessly repeatable content and an actual reason to log on
---
Your priest is named Jesus 😂
---
Where are these empty servers? Is there a list going around?
---
Or is this just another strawman for the blizz defense
---
My guild and I were talking about doing that!
---
Do you not have a friend or family member that could take the account? Maybe a guild member? Seems wrong to do group content then bail on everyone once you have your shiny loot.
---
your position also implies that this gameplay is "fun" for someone, no?
---
who's it fun for
---
I’m alliance so not my issues, I’ll get instant queues. :D maybe y’all shouldn’t have stacked Horde and camped alliance on every server. You’re going to have insane queues for BGs when they are released.
---
Why is everyone acting like they don’t know the feel you get when this happens then? Lol
---
not well clearly, but -15 is the price I pay for comedy
---
You forgot the Alliance on Skeram calling all of us Alliance who left to Heartseeker "pussies" for abandoning that hell hole while we still could.
---
I don’t think he’s saying that servers are imbalanced 9/10
---
in favor of horde. But more that 9 of 10 servers have a horde majority. If you go back to this subreddit’s last survey, it shows that there are only 2 or 3 servers in the US that are alliance dominant.
---
Are you below average?
---
it has nothing to do with “not liking this gameplay” and everything to do with efficiency and taking the path of least resistance.
---
Not necessarily,  I'd just say it's an inferior way of farming honor so people won't do it. It definitely doesn't mean they don't like it.
---
It does not show any kind of skill but I enjoyed it because I was doing the same thing when playing a warlock in vanilla.
---
Hrm was apologizing ..
---
Or more that people on dead servers complain more.
---
They have offered multiple free transfers to balance things out. They were even restricting the transfers to Horde only on realms like Skeram and Stallag, just like people asked for in this sub. 
---
All anyone ever does is complain.
---
lol I'm only level 27
---
A failed twitch streamer at that. Guy did an AMA on his own subreddit that got one comment, asking why he was so gay, lol.
---
Also a 10 man group will farm far more honor than a 100 man zerg.
---
Fucking loving it.
---
It's an unpopular opinion i guess but I want this to last what it was meant to, not just when the 60's have done a day or two of it. I know everyone wants bg's, so do I. But at the right time. This phase will vanish forever soon and I already think the patches are a bit quick.
---
Personally, I'm not max level, yet I can level fine in all this and these things are amazing when they happen, I want to enjoy and have this be around for a bit before its gone forever in favour of a more efficient honor gain.
---
Classic is an experiance that will only happen once. I DO NOT want it rushed.
---
nah im just going to reroll horde on a horde sided pvp server instead.
---
You're * 
---
Just how you're a joke for thinking this isn't anything but a copypasta
---
W.e dude. They arent transferring for one guy. Theyre transferring because the server sucks for horde who want to WPvP.
---
I'm pretty sure nearly all of the 'world pvp' at this moment are gank squads doing 10vs1 and big raid pvp. The first, you can always do that if you like to kill a pve player on a mount on their way to Dire maul. The 2nd, the servers cant really handle it properly anyway. So what is there left to 'preserve' and wait with battlegrounds?
---
They mixed pve and pvp realms in the original battlegroups. It will happen again, and we don't even know if there will be groupings at all.
---
I thought you were cancelling WoW?
---
Fuck off with race swaps and layering.
---
&gt; If you go back to this subreddit’s last survey
---
The subreddit is a small chunk of the total server populations. All that survey says is:
---
&gt; Of classic players, who also browse r/classicwow, who also saw and participated in that survey, there is a horde majority.
---
If you want to claim 90% of the servers have majority horde, back it up with some actual data.
---
Question. Are dungeons at level 40 packed because of this? I quit playing because I hate questing and it was taking me an hour plus to find groups. I may return if this has changed.
---
Leveling in hillsbrad at 30 ish is like storming the beaches of Normandy, but honestly it’s kinda fun. Once I get to my quest spot there’s no issue
---
Not really, the hit from 2pc devilsaur is amazing. Unless you have 10 or more hit don’t replace it.
---
It was way different back in the day. There weren’t as many people and the average person wasn’t nearly as geared and there weren’t a bunch of try heads with sappers
---
True. Got 80 honor off of one guy last night because it was my first kill.
---
Nelf rogues need to steal some of those
---
1 week notice lul
---
Our ubrs group met a solo pally on the way to brm. First bubble-hearth I've seen in classic.
---
I play on Gehennas EU. Come and see - Ungoro, Silithus, Winterspring, Felwood, Arathi, STV is basically all small scale stuff.
---
With lots of people comes more chaos. This is how people see the need for an organized pvp guild. If OP doesnt want disnohorable kills gotta walk with people that understand this. Organization is key. I agree with goving the BG earlier tho. This "phase" thing is just not that good.. its better to keep putting things in as needed. Christmas is too early for BGs in my opinion tho. Too little space between things and then suddenly classic is over
---
Alliance about 55/45
---
Your spell talents don't benefit your shoot skill.
---
Wow, this guy thinks very highly of himself as a WoW player lol. Not only is he super into himself, his recent comment history is just him flaming "casuals" and telling them to "go back to retail." Total jerk.
---
I'm going from Stalagg to Heartseeker. It's going on a 16 hour wait, ETA still says 3 hours which is the same when I first started the transfer. This is very annoying
---
I've only been able to play for 3 nights a week since classic released and I still made it to 60 a few weeks ago.
---
Nice troll
---
Lmao sure
---
Low key, Fused Wiring. Buy at 2.5-3.5 and sell on raid days for the repair bots. 
---
My most profitable item, has no listing fee, isn’t easily farmed (shredders in STV and expired target dummies, that’s it) and I you can easily buy out the whole market and reset the price as you see fit. 
---
TSM4 says I’ve made 722G on my fused wiring sales so far. Get in on it!
---
pre-raid bis....hate raiding? what? Why wouldn't you go for pvp-bis?
---
How do I level my (currently 49) alt?
---
Questing is out of the picture since all quests take place in areas which are frequented by level 60s. For those, you are a free snack. Everybody kills you on sight since you are green.
---
Dungeons are also kind of not good. ZF is getting too low and Sunken Temple is a shit dungeon xp-wise plus it is impossible to get into groups below 50.
---
Being on a pvp server with a decent faction balance has effectively destroyed gameplay for people around level 50. How do I continue to level up?
---
I tried just grinding mobs and ranking up my skinning some place far out in the Tanaris desert, but even there I got swooped by level 60 players and they corpse camp you twice because you are free honor.
---
No matter how bad they play and how shitty their gear is, you will not win 1vs1. Hinterlands is even worse. I should go to the Overlook and finish up collecting grog. There is constant PvP action and while I don't mind PvP, it is slowing you down, even if you are winning.
---
I hope some of you can see through the whining and actually know a solution other than not touch that alt for 2 weeks :/
---
p.s. please blizzard disable  SpyClassic addon.

If there was only a way to search Reddit posts with keywords in a specific subrediit...

Yeah the 80-20 faction split doesn’t work to well for my dwarf priest on Fairbanks :/z

Our 2 primary tanks are using 1 the mh claw and 2 the book sword from ony. So I'm good there.

I actually got Perditions blade last night lol.

Hits so damn hard.

Goodluck gettin an entire guild group to uproot themselves and all of the connections theyve made and move. Have fun with that unending shitshow.
---
"Hey, where are we putting the order for Tauren size battle axes?"
---
"Oh, just stack them over there."
---
That's not what they said. 
---
They said it's interesting how we're following a naturalistic pattern of forming larger groups at the fear of predation, similar to how gazelle will herd up in huge numbers when lions are near
---
Also made about 40+ ele fires for myself and about 5 for the guildmate before he left! Seems being petty pays off
---
Did you ever play any private servers?
---
So they go to lowbie zones and therefor attract the larger horde to the area and make it even worse for lowbies. Cool. Cool.
---
I know right? Isn't classic WoW amazing?
---
&gt;People weren't generally knowledgeable enough about the game to think about how to min/max Honor during the world PvP phase of the system back in vanilla. They are now, and it's ruined world PvP for me.
---
The funny thing is that these pvp zerg raids are actually one of the least optimal ways to farm honor.
---
This guy clearly has mental issues, actually feel pretty bad for him
---
And the data we have is the surveys that have been done. That’s the only data we’ll ever get as blizzard isn’t going to release those numbers. But from the experience described by people who frequent this subreddit as well as the data available, there is a horde majority. The fact that most servers offering character transfers are only offering horde transfers supports the data we have. Next you’re going to tell me that Azeroth is flat...

While you can get coffee-like flavor from barley alone, a beer marketed as a coffee porter or coffee stout is likely to have coffee added as well.

I remember playing Battlefield 2-4 (the shooter game series) online. When there was a slight imbalance of only 5-10% in players on a side, they would usually drain your tickets much quicker and you'd end up losing helplessly.
---
Those pesky horses
---
Wipe by next patch more likely
---
I feel like the later raids will be more spaced out because it’s not just MC/ONY easy
---
Also see: Warlocks. Who I am? Bottom Damage, Top Threat.
---
I solohealed the entire UBRS as a 31 protection specced Paladin with 20 points in Holy. Ofcourse its doable as balance. All you need is some light CC on the last packs before Drakki and everything else is a joke.
---
I play on benediction. Is that high pop? Same issue, except it’s slightly more balanced. As in, a 20 v 15 will be happening in the area you’re being camped and ganked in
---
100 rank points. Not a big deal this early on, but eventually it will matter A LOT. To compare, when pushing rank 14 you're earning ~1k rank points per week for being top 0.3% of your faction, so a single DK is a day of hardcore grind.
---
Nola guild?!
---
Gift of arthas is the highest raid dps consumable you can bring by far. get some

Step 1 play on a pvp server
---
Step 2 complain for the rest of your life as if it wasn't you shooting yourself in the foot
---
How would that prove a server is dead?
---
Who?
---
Why would you ever want to do that?
---
&gt; What will we do after P6 when nothing else is going to be new.
---
Play TBC.
---
I mean you should probably just dungeon, at that level it’s as efficient as questing and you can avoid the zergs, you’re pretty close to 60 man, don’t give up!
---
No shit sherlock
---
The state of "wpvp" is pathetic right  now. I'm on Stalagg playing horde and currently leveling in Hillsbrad. The number of level 60s looking for "pvp" groups to gank lowbies is pathetic. A guy was  bitching in chat earlier because there were no allies around for him to gank and "wpvp is dead, gg blizzard". Mate, that's not wpvp. Go anywhere with people your level and you'll find it. I saw a lot of allies leveling around the map that I didn't call out in chat because being endlessly ganked while trying to level is a bunch of bullshit.
---
Just don't pvp in raids or parties with random ppl... Get a team of 2-3 and find similar grps for great fun til bgs.
---
Chances are your axe skill isn't as high as it could be plus yes, rogues have mad dodge. At 26 your ability to get away is limited, so wing clipping and keeping distance is ideal. Then concussive shot. You likely won't win against a geared rogue who knows what he's doing.
---
It’s not about being a care bear. And this insult has become the new “snowflake” and it’s just really dumb. 
---
No one expects a perfectly balanced server but the massive imbalance makes it lame for everyone involved. Horde can easily stomp alliance because they have us 2:1 basically everywhere. It was never this bad in vanilla. Ever. 
---
Blows my mind why any horde wouldn’t want a slight challenge.
---
The irony being that the streamer server is probably the best server faction balance-wise. It's all of the other servers that are having the worst problems.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
I made this video, I'm sorry you didn't find the edits funny. I tried my best and at least some enjoy it.
---
I don’t understand any of this.
---
Nope. And besides you 've given no examples. Only incentives people would care about would be those that give them an advantage and that would be bs.
---
Did you fly into thorium point?
---
I have 30 kills so far, just ganking as rogue, but no actual honor? Where/when will my honor points show up?
---
Or...
---
Just saying....
---
PvP servers aren't for everyone. 
---
We were all saying you think it's bad now just wait for phase 2.
---
And now people are all like surprised Pikachu face.
---
It's beautiful.
---
Day 1 omegalul
---
You got downvoted for sharing a very common opinion as can be seen by the 5 front page posts about wPVP a day?
---
What you should take from my comment is this: I think conversing with you further is a waste of time. Buh bye.
---
Yep. And wonder why they haven’t after 15 years? Might be because it’s not against their rule set.
---
"I wanna play with the big boys."
---
"Mom, can you pick me up?"
---
Am I the only one that thinks preaching about the doom and gloom of world pvp while not even being 72 hours out is premature? 
---
People are excited to do something other than farm gold. Give it a week and you will already see half the number of aggressive players that you see now. Most of these players aren't honor farmers. They are just excited to do something in the game.
---
I also don't think battlegrounds will make people feel that much better. You still go to highly contested areas after talking to the battlemaster to farm hk's while you wait for a Q to pop. If you're horde you either Q in UC and go to WPL/EPL or you Q in org and go to Felwood/Winterspring. If your alliance you Q in ironforge and fly to BRM. You may not have constant Raids running around ganking but flight masters will still be camped and towns will still be death traps.
---
I'm just saying maybe wait a week and let people realize the highest possible rank is 4 for next week and their 6 hours spent at southshore only netted them rank 2 and a trinket.
---
Hm. Characters, not players, but you’d think statistically it would still indicate player skewing.
---
I’m curious if zone dominance by ally farming groups  was an illusion. It doesn’t seem possible. I was killed constantly, I saw huge groups of allies constantly not one group of horde. Interesting.
---
#no changes
---
I can't tell who has mental issues here...
---
The thing is if you are trying to minmax honor. The 40man death squad sitting at a fp in a leveling zone is the worst way to achieve it. Small groups of 5-10 going to the front of enemy capitals or brd and getting a steady influx of 40-60 honor per kill is much more efficient. If people are just griefing level 49s they are wasting their time just as much as they are wasting the low level players.
---
I’m a priest so I’m gonna drop tailoring like a hot rock once I craft truefaith!
---
Yeah I don't disagree with that to be honest, although many may of started later. I was more getting at someone talking about being a "competitive player" which at this point in classic is just lols even with the honor system out , it's only gonna be the absolute most dedicated that get anywhere with wpvp and it's not gonna be a fair fight most of the time (I love wow wpvp but not gonna lie to myself that it's balanced/competitive)
---
Thats what you get for playing alliance on a pvp server. Seriously.
---
By spring, transmog.
---
West Plaguelands or Un'goro Craters. Or BRD. Just do the quests.
---
So you can't recognize how Blizzard dramatically increasing server sizes might have contributed to peoples' mismanaged expectations??
---
It updates once a week, used to be a Wednesday I think.
---
This is one of the situations that players created and did to themselves. Blizzard warned people that "medium" servers today have more players than even the most populated vanilla servers butt people refused to go to low/medium servers. They were so paranoid about having a "playable population" that they all stayed on mega servers that come no where close to replicating vanilla. 
---
Most servers are well above their carrying capacity as far as resources, questing, and ability to avoid unwanted contact (pvp in this case).
---
I hate you and everyone like you who want to ruin world pvp even faster than you when it was live 15 years ago. Go run a dungeon if you want to hide in an instance.
---
Dishonourable kills don’t matter this week. The honour reduction happens right away, and we’re all at 0.
---
That's every pull as an oomkin.
---
Yea I came from Skeram. I feel bad about killing these overwhelmed horde, but then remember I'd be getting it even worse on Skeram.
---
Got a source for 80/20 claim?
---
Me either. I can't tell if I'm missing context or backstory or what.
---
Yeah, we didn't know better, so we flew there. Insta regret :D
---
It’s so worth it. He tells you what to pick up in town for quests that you can instantly turn in and stuff like that. Very very very helpful info for any ally priest.
---
Uh yeah... If your server is 30/70 alliance/horde and you have faction specific queues that enforce equal numbers, that means over half of horde players could *never* log in. That would completely ruin PvE for horde because you could never get your raid full.
---
It's exactly what I was expecting. And what I was telling others to expect.
---
Yes, so I try to only play for a couple of hours a day.
---
The amount of entitlement in this thread is astounding.
---
Apparently no one understand software development.
---
Hit the nail on the head with this. I'm actually surprised you got upvoted knowing this sub and Reddit in general.
---
And we’re is your evidence that supports your claim? Because the numerous surveys that have been done support my claim yet you have no data that supports yours other than “I don’t want it to be this way because I’m a horde”
---
Kinda....level 50-55 is kind of a lost area for dungeons. Sure, you can spam zombies at ZF for not a lot of progress or you can try and find a party for Mara runs, but good luck with that and usually people only run Mara once or twice. Imo, questing from 50-55 is a better idea and then hitting up BRD for level 60.
---
What class are you? 
---
If you’re a class without a speed boost (warrior), like me, this can be very difficult. often your best bet is to carve your way through the mobs for that exp boost; if they’re over leveled for you and your gear isn’t exceptional that wouldn’t be an issue.
---
Druids can run faster, mages can blink, hunters can run faster and feign death, warlocks could in theory sacrifice pet, shamans have ghost wolf...paladins have blessing of freedom?
---
One thing that can be helpful are “lesser invisibility potions”, they usually go for 50s to 95s each, which might be out of your ballpark. However, the 15s of invisibility can save you a death (20s or more potentially depending on level), and some deaths can take 20+ minutes to recover from depending on how far the spirit healer is.  They can also be used in pvp to run away as long as you don’t have DOTs kn you.
---
If you have an alchemist buddy you could buy the ingredients wild steel bloom and fade leaf to possibly make at 30-40s or lower. 
---
You might find these a really nice escape button to have
---
epic encounter? did you kill all the lvl 54 15vs1 on the entrance to brd?
---
Spy is the stupidest fucking addon every created and I curse whoever made it
---
I saw a video recently of a mage being a shithead ninja and then like claiming it was ok because people want the most _powerful_ players to have the gear.
---
It's a shame I can't remember their name now... oh well.
---
if you enter blackrock mountain from the south rather than the north you'll have a (slightly) better time in my experience.
---
A lot of bosses are leashed to their spawn location precisely because at one point in time during vanilla people started pulling bosses away from their original location. It's why they don't just kidnap Magmadar from his room and just straight up kill him in some other room.
---
I don't disagree that it makes it easier, but that does not change the fact that A) It was doable in Vanilla and B) It's "possible" without an addon at all. Y'all are just nitpicking and need to accept that this isn't going away because of those reasons. Let me reiterate: I agree with y'all that it ruins the aspect of surprise in pvp, an important aspect at that, but I also realize any SMART pvper would be able to deal with it anyways, addon or not.
---
census addons work again? where can I find population info
---
Couldn't agree more bro
---
Its because bgs arent out yet and everyone understands the honor system now and are trying to rank. There will be less gank squads when bgs come out and more 1v1 in open world.
---
We need naxxramas by next week or I'm unsubbing that simple.
---
As someone who played during this period of vanilla on a higher pop server... yea it was.  the same camp areas are being camp - it is almost unplayable in the same regions as it was back then.  Leveling post 40 is sometimes an outright nightmare - but it will end.
---
It will die off - organizing large groups is super hard and render minimal impact on rewards... so it’s easier to AV - WSG and eventually AB for rewards.
---
As alliance I feel the exact opposite. I practically never attack horde while leveling because it always begets numbers of horde coming to gank me and outnumber be. The alliance are definitely more organized though. For example, versus logged out their characters right on the raid bosses and had people ready to kill the world bosses, and they had no contest by the horde.
---
Leave your guild, find a smaller guild that is recruiting players for their 1st raid team. PUG MC and Ony in the meantime.
---
You should be able to see honor but not your rank. For instance I have about 4000k honor with 800 kills.
---
From what I understand only the most recent round of free transfers have been faction specific to try to balance server population.
---
You didn't ask or advice so I won't give any but I just want to point out that you have a lot to say about how other people are playing but any shortcomings your party members have could be overcome by you playing even moderately well.
---
The debuff doesn't affect anything in mc.
---
I’d LOVE an 80v80, but it’s not that. It’s 80v50 or worse odds.
---
People sell services all  the time. Several people tanks on my server charges four tanking
---
&gt; And we’re is your evidence that supports your claim?
---
[I didn't make a claim, I challenged yours.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof)
---
&gt; Because the numerous surveys that have been done support my claim
---
The *SINGLE* survey you mentioned (and failed to provide) is severely flawed, I have explained why.
---
Watch this, 
---
* of players surveyed 100% of servers are alliance favored.
---
That statement is true, (Players surveyed: 1, myself). The data is flawed, which means the conclusion is BS.
---
Yeah not the way to get to brm as alliance currently.   I play on a 65 35 server and there's definitely a tax on time due to world pvp but smart players can reduce it.
---
Honestly I'm a casual 33 human priest. I don't mind it. I managed to collect all the Southshore quests despite the hilarious absurd antics ensuing around me. MH is a little shit and getting the boat almost impossible. STV has a lot of campers... It has made leveling harder but not impossible. Once I'm out of the hot spots I normally can level in moderate peace. I'm on an Aussie server and a lot of the 60s just walk right past me now when I used to get slaughtered pre-p2. 
---
I rolled PvP knowing what to expect...
---
I'm not looking forward to 45ish though.
---
Yes, the zerg from starcraft has infiltrated WoW.
---
I live in Indy and I'm totally gonna check this out now
---
No. If you knew you were going to play casually don’t play on a pvp server. Honor gear is better than AQ 40 and shouldn’t be pushed early.
---
Fuck spy. It is some bullshit that feels like a nuke, "if I don't have it and then do I'm by default behind". Sucks that there is an add-on that gives that feeling.
---
Every Tuesday when the server resets.
---
We started raid 2 last week. It was a little over half guild and the rest pugs. A handful of the pugs joined the guild by the end of the night. We cleared domo but ran out of time for rag. Not bad for week 1. 
---
But I’m in a guild with an extremely long history spanning multiple games. We have solid leadership and rules in place for the groups.
---
I don’t know if you realized if, but resources are supper scarce also. They still run on tiny server respawn rates. I’m on mankrik, and the high level herb market is really sad. Half the herbs for things like elixir of mongoose or Major Mana potions are only posted on the ah in a super limited quantity. On some occasions, I’ve had to do without consumables because I couldn’t buy or farm materials to make them.
---
Yup. Shocking isn't it?
---
iirc, Blizzard said that offhandedly in 1 AMA like a week before launch. They hardly did their job in raising awareness about such a drastic change.
---
&gt; play always with WM
---
Yes absolutely, the answer is obviously the extreme other end.
---
Fucking /s you goon.
---
Omg.. this is scary. Please delete this before we have armies of naked paladins deleting horde.
---
*Gasp* it's almost like they've had 15 years to perfect it!
---
TBH its a pretty impressive run, but that raid group is depressingly overfilled with warriors. What a nightmare being a warrior in that guild must be.
---
"Okay X warrior item dropped, all 30 of you roll."
---
Go to brd lol why are you in mara/st.
---
enter blackrock mountain from the south. Nowhere near as bad from my experience.
---
This sub is really, really bad when it comes to complaining. 
---
Remember skeletons?
---
There would have been a queue with so many people back in vanilla.
---
  /join lookingforgroup
---
I'll assume all PVP servers are a shit show right now. I hit 60 Wednesday night and I empathize with everyone trying to get there.
---
Smolderwebs Wetlands boat to the Marsh are always filled with Horde.
---
There were Rogues and disguised mages in Ironforge last night
---
Where can we find updated stats for the Alliance:Horde ratio?
---
If we want PVP balance, the solution is to log-off in an inn and collect rest bonus until this cools down.
---
Being on a normal server I'm going to agree with this. Although I dont mind it the lackluster of PvP is kinda tough. We do put together alot of PvP raids now. And me being a prot warrior i just wanna carry that flag!
---
Not really, its a multiplayer game and youre competing with other players over limited resources.
---
There’s plenty, you just need to find them yourself! Don’t go off world chat, that’s where the zergs are guided from. But I will agree that when you have a handful it’s not every battle you get a good fight or anything - but when it happens it’s sick!
---
Big ol whoosh my dude.
---
The point is that Horde doesn't have a monopoly on this kind of stuff.
---
There was a blue post 2 days ago stating that they were going to fix the "visual bug" for not being able to see your honorable kills
---
When this reset went live a lot of players got there honor tab updated. unfortunately mine was not.
---
Made an official post on blizzard forums and it seems like a lot of other people had the same. Went to bed last night with the honor page still empty, then woke up this morning to this.
---
Not only is this incorrect but the math is all wrong. 
---
Anyone else getting this error?
---
Why so few comments? Dead game?
---
How could it have been? Blizzard themselves came out and said that a low pop. server today would be the same as a high pop server in Vanilla. In EU the lowest pop servers are Medium, which means every server today is facing World PVP at an extent that was literally impossible in original Vanilla.
---
I'm not arguing that it's dissimilar. FPs were camped, SS/TM existed, questing was periodically a pain. I'm saying that the extent and volume of world pvp is at rates that were never experienced in Vanilla, and never intended to be experienced.
---
Lolwat
---
The reaching for excuses to be mad at blizzard on this subreddit is insane.
---
Also fun fact dishonorable kills should be released with phase 3. Becuase it was not in the game before WSG and AV.
---
So because *you* were expecting this random, drastic change from vanilla, you want to totally shit on people who weren't?
---
That's what I was missing from this story. Gotcha that makes more sense.
---
If you're lvling alts, are you also spending the time to gear up your main
---
Bgs wont be fun if you're in quest greens vs the no lifers will hand of rag and full t1 or bis...
---
Yes but they yesterday tab is still showing the two days before
---
Yea, pea brain confirmed.
---
Exactly, Blizz messed up and now the servers are permanently messed up. Everyoje knows horde is op in pvp, and now the server balance is fubar. At this point, faction-based queues would be too little too late.
---
5 AM server time is when I start to notice the population go up. It’s crazy how early these players are getting on instead of sleeping in lol.
---
oh nice, census addons work again??? where can I find population info
---
Wrong
---
&gt; every time; play content impossible
---
You group up and push em out, and then you go about questing.
---
Horde is gonna have huge BG queues, they wont stop magically to that. They will have to farm HKs in world between every BG if serious.
---
Exactly why I quit classic and why I expect most others to do the same.
---
In retail I can live my life and still have a high ilvl while playing casually with my friends, I enjoy pve rotations much more, and the pvp requires at least a basic skill level that classic barely has (only certain classes in classic like rogue and mage even have a skillcap)
---
Not at all. 
---
There have been warning signs all the way through. 
---
Blizzard even offered free char transfers. u/blorgensplor up there summed it up nicely
---
I love pilav.
---
They really need to take spy out.
---
Honor has been out for 3 days... 3 days. Literally nothing can make you people happy lmao. "It just isn't that fun." Getting wPvP'd really isn't that fun in any way. It is there to make the game more difficult when you're out on your own. That's why you get yourself a party and you do quests, or you smash your way into a dungeon. By making the game more difficult, you make the game more rewarding. If this is not something that interests you roll on a PvE server. :)
---
I seriously hope Blizzard releases the battlegrounds soon so that these kids have somewhere to farm their honor. The game is borderline unplayable right now when you're above level 50. I'm on my 16th corpse run in Un'goro today because groups of level 60 rogues roam the zone to kill you for that small drop of honor. It was not like this back in the day.
---
Pls post a picture of your gold as well :)
---
Check open transfers. If not, you gotta level a new one
---
The thing is, you were given the choice to play in a different box from them, but you chose the pvp box.  This IS their pvp box. You chose to be in it.
---
Lmao I'm a 33 priest and somehow managed to pick up all quests in South shore and walk out despite a100 man war going on around me.
---
Meh. People have been craving for this world pvp for ages, let them have their fun. You are not obliged to start ranking up now, just wait for BGs
---
How it worked in retail Vanilla:  
---
\-After a server restart there was a 15 hour cooldown where nothing could spawn (probably to prevent people from deliberately crashing a server to force more spawns)  
---
\-The first wave of spawns was always between hour 15 and hour 30 after a server restart (for US players this is why we all skipped our college classes Wednesday morning :P)  
---
\-After spawn #1 was killed, it went on a 30 hour cooldown   
---
\-After the 30 hour cooldown, spawn #2 could occur any time over a 72 hour window
---
Badlands has been lit on my server. Sucks that I’m only lvl43 but if I hang around the edges of the battle I can nab some HK’s. I really like WPVP and I hope it doesn’t die down too much after BG’s come out.
---
Ah, my fault. I tried to explain it in the imgur album captions, but long story short: dick shaman flames guildie, I come and help with hunter to farm, he gets angry
---
ST?
---
Also why wait for BRD until 60?  Either you can get your pre-raid BiS or you can get your pre-raid BiS *and* xp.  Seems really inefficient.
---
Welcome to the Grob Mob, friend. Best server around.
---
Edit: join us at r/Grobbulus
---
And where can I check it?
---
Maybe refute my post then?
---
As I’ve said, yes, the servers are already fubar and blizzard should have implemented them from the beginning. There should have been at least some pressure influencing people to roll ally, not for any dumb reason, but just so we have like 3k people playing on either side, which MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IF YOU WANT A FAIR GAME.
---
Yeah, and if wPVP meant everyone playing like that I would totally be in favor of it. However, the current honor system incentivizes no-lifers to run around in packs of 3-5 farming all the players who are just trying to level.
---
Even that wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that there're an order of magnitude more people playing than there were in vanilla, so the murderfest is completely inescapable
---
&gt; a month
---
P2 came out 3 days ago.
---
I don't think that everyone hates phase2, but it would seem a lot of people do. The way phase 2 is in the game is dogshit. Dishonorable kills being in the game makes pvp near inns and cities incredibly risky(DKs were introduced with BGs BTW), and most servers have garbage server splits.
---
I do have some fun, but I would pref BG's every single day of the week month or year. And I think you might just be in the minority.
---
Benediction is huge population?
---
“Removed”
---
I must know
---
InB4 archive
---
?? Thats because in vanilla there was a much bigger pet system - Classic has pre-tbc pet system, where literally only Broken tooth matters, since Only attack speed is counted now.
---
In vanilla we had a LOT of pets that were situationally the best - pets that run faster than epic mounts, pets with resistances, the wolf with shadow damage,. so OFC there is a much bigger focus on broken tooth now.
---
some ppl (every time this is mentioned) out there will say its a good thing - calling Lupos OP and its good he is gone, but thats dumb as fuck since Broken tooth was - and also is in vanilla- the strongest option in PVP, and in Raiding hunters arent that good anyways, so lupos being BiS there wouldnt have hurt. Im personally really dissapointed such a big part of vanilla, as a hunter, has been scrapped.
---
the ah scan function has been there since the last update ( about a month ago or so)
---
No offense but why would you stay on your overpopulated server when the free transfers were available?
---
Lmao imagine being this salty
---
99% of the time either your max rank or lowest rank learned after 20 will be your most efficient heal, depending on if you are geared or not.
---
In bloodsail there is a lfg and a lookingforgroup
---
So what’s the long term plan for classic? Like how far will they go with the updates. Will there be a point where they stop doing phases and updates and leave it at a good stopping point or something?
---
Shatter doesn't work, winter's chill does from what I understand.
---
Confused. Isn't bubble hearthstone the ABCs of Paladin? And now you're back on Eastern Kingdoms and your raid is in Aszhara? Not even trying to be a whiney lil bitch, maybe I'm missing something here? Why is this a 'tree portal'?
---
I play on a pvp server and I try to help out the opposing faction with quests and the like whenever I can, and even I think you're really, REALLY overreacting. Murderer? Put in jail? It's a game, bro.
---
I walked almost all the way to gnomer before i remembered the teleport existed.
---
Beating league would be like raiding wotlk with phase one classic gear
---
Ye, I remember people pulling Geddon and Shazzrah back to Garr almost from the beginning. One of the guilds I played in later also did some real [shenanigans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcehl8KZMBo&amp;t) in MC back in the day with that stuff. Although they're wearing Naxx gear in that video and is still able to kite many of the bosses all throughout the instance...
---
I would love this. I'm on a PvE realm and it's hard to find any real action and I need to kill mans!
---
That's like exactly what stalag and skeram are
---
Lmfao
---
I reckon not many people have heard of Ayurveda.
---
It’s not hard to understand why he’d say that though, they were probably worried about retail becoming worse because of players leaving for classic. Which is a very understandable concern. Then BFA happened and everybody left anyway, which gave classic an opportunity.
---
Because people have been ganking a lot this past couple days, leveling has been tough.
---
Sounds like the opposite to me. The movie was bad because the acting was horrible and the story was fucking garbage. The actual leaders of the nerd army think it's amazing because it's Warcraft and will love anything with a Blizzard name on it.
---
no I support the Chinese Party now.
---
This phase is ass, my dude. This shitty experience needs to be replaced.
---
Should have rolled pve server if you dont want to pvp. Also, why play ally on a pvp server? All vested pvpers play Horde.
---
What's the gp/hr doing BRD?
---
Speaking as a warrior, yes please. Make it stop! Give the kids their BGs to entertain themselves with!
---
Y'all need to learn how to do big battles. If we had good coordinate with OP flank groups, it would be much more fun.
---
Ha ha ha! I love these posts! Everyone has done something like this somewhere and time in the game.
---
How do people restealth so often in fights? I’ve watched people gouge and restealth during fights many times but it never works for me. Always stuck in combat
---
Sad alliance member spotted.
---
It's got nothing to do with vanilla WoW being fundamentally good or bad.  Another poster summed it up better but basically gaming culture has changed.  In 2004 people weren't as laser focused on efficiency and rushing like they are in 2019.  Additionally, being a troll is glorified now.
---
What I meant is why they even have to specify (ABV) when it is obvious. And obviously, % it self is not necessarily just volume, you can also use % to mean weight. But it just seems so odd to add (ABV).
---
My post got removed for lack of flair but I set one so it should be good now
---
I couldn’t agree more. I actually canceled my subscription with the note “will probably be back when BGs are released”
---
I played all through vanilla and then BC and then vanilla private servers on and off for the next bunch of years. The first time I installed spy in classic when I hit level 30 on my first character it literally felt like cheating. I have never before experienced this type of add-on and it honestly just felt like hacking it was just so overpowered and I figured it would be removed from the game after blizzard became wise to it.
---
I'm not saying Blizzard is blameless here, they obviously botched server balance in a way that seems irreparable.  
---
&gt; You all act as if there were any options. There are NONE 
---
If you're bent on playing one particular faction that is out numbered, you do have the option of compromise.  Play on a different server with a better balance, or roll on a PvE server.    If there is not a server with a favorable balance, then choose to play the other faction.  There are plenty of choices here, but none if you're unwilling to compromise.  
---
It's regrettable that the balance is so bad, but let's not pretend that you only had (have) the option to play a minority faction on a PvP server.
---
I’m a filthy casual so my main is only level 54 right now. Likely just running BRD till 60 at this point but I wish there was a way to even out the pvp servers just a bit. Seems like they’re all a 10:1 ratio one way or the other.
---
That is a couple of deaths, a minor inconvenience, carry invis pots and run away
---
Christmas is 4 months post launch and bwl wont even be out yet. 5 months per raid tier is a perfect timeline for classic, bgs coming early wont impact it at all.
---
when asmonbald goes on about jokes, if you dont know someone you are not allowed to tell jokes about them,

---
Interested in your answers. Id rather play a fire build myself.
---
This is actually a great advice. I've quit WoW since I posted this and I've deleted my characters. Too time consuming.
---
Blows my mind when people shit on retail for streamlining a lot of things and smoothing out the bumps on the fender of classic wow. 
---
Yeah, retail went too far with LFR and other such things but it also did a lot of things well. Even minor things like not having to go back to a FP or a city to repair. It’s not that I don’t have the time, it’s that I can’t be fucked going all the way back for a minor thing.
---
Shield block, not shield wall.
---
I wish I could upvote twice.
---
Spy is awful and should not be allowed in the game. 
---
Hopefully if we make enough noise Blizzard might take notice.
---
If you agree that Blizz jacked up the server sizes too high at the expense of everything else like basic resources, then how in the world is that the players fault? 
---
Most people wanted the "authentic vanilla experience," were we all supposed to just roll on servers marked on low pop and somehow know that actually meant high pop in vanilla terms?
---
Your reasoning is so backward. This is literally a new problem that Blizzard created despite the playerbase being as vocal as possible about "no changes." The players shouldn't have to make counter-intuitive decisions like rolling on low-pop servers just to dance around Blizz's bizarre changes.
---
I might actually reinstate my classic account if this happens
---
AD Friendly food is \~2g per stack, Also 4410 Mana
---
Because P2 and honor just dropped.
---
And if your solution is "break the phasing so you can fix one side's problem on some servers" (my server certainly doesn't seem to have issues) then um...no?
---
I got downvoted for suggesting the Alliance group up and wipe Horde. Oh no, playing the game!
---
Saw it on Wowhead some days ago but I reckon you’ll find something on the Blizzard forums
---
Yeah, which they avoided by adding more Realms as more players joined. Classic was more front-loaded and increased caps/layering allowed more players on each Realm.
---
I’m just saying the discrepancy isn’t that bad.  I remember (this part is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt) needing to log off and return later due to camped area WAY more often in the past, this is primarily because the game was new so everyone tried to follow the same route and do
---
Stuff together - now we know if one area is being camped, going to the other areas isn’t hard.
---
Raid areas are just a perma no go (looking at you dustwallow and searing gorge) if you don’t want to wPvP - and it was absolutely like that in vanilla too.
---
Even with server pops - it will die out.  People like rewards - and they don’t like waiting for them forever.  Putting together a large wPvP group isn’t easy, and they yield less honor than a BG (and less rewards) - that will take over.
---
Until then - it really isn’t much different.  Also - it’s not like this was an unknown - EVERYONE knew this was coming, it is the most nostalgic part of vanilla (idk why, it was always a clusterfuck).   This is why PvE servers exist.
---
No. You either wait for the hype to die down or reroll
---
Yeah, bigger is not always better. Imagine a 1:1 scale stranglethorn vale. Would be like the size of the Congo.
---
How many people did you have? It seemed like you had a ton so I guess I’m just confused why running would be a tactic here?
---
The problem I’ve seen is the alliance would rather run 90% of the time than grouping up and fighting back.
---
There are no Realms with authentic caps currently. And I play on a PvE Realm, all of which have huge populations. So even if I was willing to gamble on the population not becoming larger than in Vanilla, it would not be possible.
---
Someone who wants massive changes to the game should be the person to pick a different server and Realm type. Not the person who wants to play Vanilla.
---
That being said, if they did make a Vanilla Realm, I would roll there immediately. Then those who prefer #changes Realms can keep those. But it would be wrong to force those who want Vanilla to do this, as Classic was advertised as the authentic Vanilla experience.
---
Have you ever experienced warlocks both pulling aggro + life tapping at 1k health in high level dungeons as a healer? Clearly you have not ;D
---
Whilst a large portion of the rather lacking difficulty is increased playerskill and HW performance, 1.12 talents, the improved gear rework and the nerfs from the earliest iterations of MC certainly has played a big part as well.
---
Yes bubble hearthstone is the "ABCs of Paladin". So he used his elementary skill to allow his entire dead group/raid to also be able to hearth out. 
---
They focused on him while his group took advantage of the 10+ seconds of no attacks. And they did so behind a 🌲
---
Making faction only transfers doesn't immediately resolve the issue if they aren't willing.
---
You get gear damage if the killing blow is from an NPC. 
---
The enemy player gets honor pretty much no matter what. As long as they have dealt damage to you recently and inside a large radius then it doesn't matter what you die to.
---
I mean, when DKs mean something next week, less whole town camping will happen.  But yeah battlegrounds would be nice
---
Not saying I don't believe you but where is the data coming from?
---
Flair on Apollo?
---
Well picking your server carefully was part of the game back then and you can always reroll to a server in your favor or at least more balanced, but I don’t think it’ll be as big of a deal once the novelty wears off.
---
Side note: I actually like that some servers are more dominate one side or another, gives you some choice...
---
IE if you aren’t very pvp competent you can roll somewhere where the opposition isn’t as strong to avoid getting rekt while still having the option to pvp sometimes.
---
And now we're trying to say to you that PvP servers are in an unhealthy place, and are quickly becoming one-sided PvE servers. Telling frustrated people to reroll, most of whom are on minority factions, is terrible for PvP servers. And beyond that, it's fucking rude and makes you sound like a total elitist.
---
It's going to be beautiful when *you're* "surprised Pikachu face" because your server has gotten to a 70-30 or 80-20 faction split and world PvP is dead.
---
Idk, my experience has been forming a group and having to try 7-8 zones before calling it a day because everywhere is overwhelmed by sheer numbers.
---
It just depends on your server and faction. It feels like most pvp servers are heavily split one side or the other. If your on the heavily populated faction then yeah you’ll likely have a blast.
---
i love your addon. been using it ever since your first release/ reddit post.
---
it works great, thank you for your hard work!
---
if time permits, could you add a bit of customization funktionality?
---
alpha, background, color, border, text size, fonts etc. that would be awesome!
---
Dude I was 52 on Tuesday. I’m 57 now and have 34 honorable kills. You do stand a chance.
---
The servers are not that unbalanced to the point where you should reroll or quit.
---
If you are Alliance leave SS. You will be outnumbered there, but you should be able to pick fights anywhere else on the continent.
---
What were the "warning signs" that Blizz was gonna jack server sizes up waaay past their vanilla limits?
---
Faerlina is in a terrible state right now. Also as I was expecting. 
---
But honestly this is only going to be bad for a few weeks. 
---
Wpvp will be dead in a month or two regardless. It will go back to how things were once the novelty wears off. And or phase 3.
---
I'm not worried.
---
I think both vanilla wow and classic wow are great. Also being a troll was totally glorified in 2004. We just didn’t do it on stream. 
---
That’s exactly what the fuck I’m saying. Idk what you guys expected. Back in vanilla wow we legit sat there all day griefing each other. We didn’t even just grief opposing factions. We griefed our own faction. People legit would do a little raid prep, raided, and then filled in all the other time griefing and trolling each other into hell and then causing drama on the forums about it. The only difference now is your servers are more packed and you guys cause drama on reddit about it. 
---
The gaming culture may have changed but what’s playing out now hasn’t. Some of you probably mystified this shit because you were 12 when you were playing and didn’t really understand what was all going on. Others of you heard all these stories and just had some sort of fantasy of what was going to go down. But on high pop servers this is basically how it all went down. I’m not sure what y’all were expecting. 
---
Ps. Battlegrounds aren’t gonna keep people out of BRM good luck.
---
It seems like a LOT of people "thought they did but don't" in regards to wPvP
---
I did not see 2 horde raids in that video.
---
Alliance are consistently running away because they think they are outnumbered.
---
You’re correct here but I will give you a good answer.
---
It’s an ethically challenging position to claim that one should be able to cause others discomfort.
---
Abstractly, cases exist where this is ok within a broader context (school integration annoyed racists). However, because the premise is that you are intentionally causing discomfort to others, the burden of proof is on you to show why this is ok PROVIDED that you agree that in general people should not cause each other discomfort.
---
If you don’t agree that people shouldn’t cause discomfort to each other, you’re a dick anyway, which is just another way of saying you embrace self-serving values. This is objectively worthy of challenge by other people because if everyone behaves this way the world would suck. Objective ethics can be shown by asking what behavior would basically be ok if it was displayed by all people. Self-serving behavior is only possible by exploiting a majority of people who are not also behaving this way.
---
So there’s your answer but look how long it took. The ad hominem saves so much time and it’s still so likely to be correct that people just do that instead.
---
Commenting if someone could reply to me when there’s an answer I’ll love you forever
---
So.. you *dont* have an actual arguement to make then? Why even bother replying other than to look foolish?
---
THISSSSS
---
I'm in love with the chaos and the added stress of trying to get my Shaman to level. I love looking for party members around my level, because I know I'll get ganked on my own. It just adds another layer of difficulty to the game  that makes you have to think. Everyone just wants something handed to them without going through the learning curve.
---
Disclaimer: If you're complaining about Honor PvP THREE days after it has come out. Save yourself (and everyone else) the headache and roll on PvE.
---
I feel bad for alliance on my server, they are way outnumbered and it's excruciating for them to level.
---
&gt; do they know they’re literally going to have zero alliance in a few months if they keep this up?
---
Nope, they dont. That's exactly what happened on Stallag.
---
Its definitely wrong lol what's wrong with you. You think people should be shitty to others for no reason?
---
Why midnight? 7pm est in org and SW would be the best way to check activity.
---
Org lags out on tues night on Heartseeker due to Ony buff, and horde only has 30% of the server pop, at best
---
just because you get ganked ;)
---
dont play on a pvp server then
---
Completely different. Tanks charging has been happening for years, you're paying them for their time to tank a dungeon they don't need for your group.
---
Using retail gold (which can be obtained through tokens for real money) to buy your Classic boosts is the buying levels with extra steps 
---
Use your Classic gold to buy your levels and then that's fair.
---
Grobbulous?
---
You on benediction?
---
Ah yes, just pick your server. Not like a ton of us subbed and reserved names before the game even launched. Real easy to pick a server at that point.
---
I agree. What we specifically need is an early WSG single dungeon. So we can have Alterac for phase 3. And we really need it ASAP.
---
There's a list somewhere about the max ranks per leve , I believe rank 14 requires 58 or 59
---
As far as I understand you do not gain more honor for high lvl targets.
---
Overall it is a terrible idea to to rank up at lower lvls. You rank much slower then only case I've seen it be useful is at 59 for BG's because the 60 ones were constant losses.
---
PvE servers are underrated
---
Make sure you drink while you walk too
---
I've never even been close to letting it get this far just /ignore after MAYBE two exchanges.
---
Before the beta launched they were talking about server size. During the beta they were talking about stress testing because of increased server size...
---
The game was re-released 15 years later... With a huge playerbase....
---
Like fuck use your head a little bit here... This is in the common sense area.
---
Alliance races+paladins are superior when played by skilled players in co-ordinated groups.
---
Horde racials are faceroll, the average player will be a lot more effective using orcs (who's PvP racial is constant) or undead (press button when feared)
---
Sounds like you should have rolled on a pve server
---
Everyone was told and warned the community isn't as it was back in 2006, and everyone continued to pretend it would be anyway.
---
You're now seeing the effects of the culture of players in the 2010s. Efficiency and being a dick to minorities takes priority over other things.
---
&gt; And btw I love PvP and also wPvP. But for me that means I fight other people in my lvl area in that zone
---
Thanks! Will add this tonight.
---
&gt; Or maybe just learn to play correctly.
---
You aren't very bright are you? I'm having plenty of "success" picking kills off the side, aka creating the number advantage which is exactly what I said in my post.
---
Because if a server only has people on at 7pm it's dead.
---
Sad we only get 2 BGs in classic and 1 instance that's 40 people per side rushing to the other base with no pvp in between.
---
i agree
---
Those aren’t choices though. Plenty of people love PvP and want real PvP not this gank fest that people are pretending is genuine PvP. There really aren’t any other servers that have good balance that are PvP servers. 
---
A compromise isn’t doing something entirely different from what you planned. 
---
I don’t care that much about the ganking because it’s going to happen until every trip to BRM outside of when you have a raid at your back leads to 30 minutes worth of corpse runs. When you try and quest in any zone and there are so many lvl 60s killing you and all the NPCs that you can’t quest. 
---
So right now I can’t farm for anything I need for my raids because I get corpse camped literally everywhere I go and I can’t play an alt because the NPCs are also being camped - this just isn’t fun right now.
---
A lot of people made the choice to play on PVP realms because thats what they knew in true Vanilla.  What they didn't anticipate is how differently people play video games in 2019.  There were no streamers, only an absolute sliver of the population cared to down the content "World first" and people generally played at a slower pace.  All of this to sum up that when people chose a PVP server they were probably basing it off a prior experience and not factoring in how the landscape has changed.
---
I’ve had to give up on my 54 warrior... I can average 10k xp per hour with being constantly ganked by roaming ganksquads of 2-4 lvl 60 mc/ony geared horde... at that pace it only takes 16+ hours per level... yay
---
I may forgotten to remove stuff from the todo list. :)
---
There is a mechanic while kiting where you can jump and face the enemy sideways as they're about to swing, the game will register the attack as having hit you from the front and you wont get dazed.
---
&gt; I'm speaking on behalf of others.
---
You're a joke.
---
Thanks for the summary, but I’m well aware. Now we have so many players on each server that world pvp is totally messed up and not like vanilla at all.
---
They still should have had pop caps per faction, even with layering. They should have had even more servers, and still kept layering, in my opinion. If you want to play on the overpopulated faction, then expect to have a longer queue. If they had faction-specific queues from the beginning, then they wouldn’t be an issue now.
---
Just because the servers are more powerful doesn’t mean the pop cap should be increased after phase 1, because there are still the same number of flight masters, quest givers, and places to be. Wpvp in classic now has way more ganking potential than in vanilla, which was already something a lot of people didn’t like (not me i think ganking was fine back in vanilla). There are way too many people out in the world, preventing you from doing things you could do easier back in vanilla.
---
Yeah
---
The age old question, which came first: the anvil or the anvil?
---
Definitely arenas&gt; rated bgs. Arenas are way more mechanically demanding, and why it became a professional stage. Every second counts.
---
World PvP is a joke anyway because of dishonorable kills, so releasing the honor system early without battlegrounds was a huge mistake, and it's a mistake that anyone who actually understood the honor system saw coming when they saw the honor system in phase 2 separated from battlegrounds in phase 3.
---
So, again, if you're playing on a realm and not having a good time because of the faction imbalance of that realm, transfer off that realm.  Don't come to Reddit pissing and moaning that PvP activity is happening on a PvP realm, by choice, and you have the option of solving that problem for yourself, but won't, again, by choice.
---
That doesnt make any sense at all. Most people play from 5pm to 11pm or so.
---
These arent private servers with the entirety of the world's timezones compromising the playerbase.
---
I think checking server pop at midnight and claiming dead server is even more disingenuous then just claiming there are dead servers with no "proof"
---
This is my deep dark secret I hope actually happens lol
---
I’m so happy to see this post. I am actually letting my subscription run out in 5 days for this very reason. The fights are never fair and I got my first DK last night from some Moron in my group. I had fun for the first hour but now I am just feeling really frustrating/ annoyed. I’ll def try again when BGs come out but world PvP is just not working right now. It’s supposed to be fun and I can’t support the game with my money until it’s fun again.
---
If the lowbies take the bait and attack they get flagged, even in a safe zone.
---
Yup. I kinda imagine the people complaining to be the ones that powered to 60 without partying up once lmao. 
---
I'm not 60 yet, because I'm in tbe middle of moving, but I'm level 48... perfect level to get ganked, and I'm still loving the game and the PvP. Even when I get ganked. It has forced me to group up with people more, which never is a bad thing
---
Thats not PvP
---
Sounds like your guild offers you nothing. If they won’t even help you with UBRS then I would leave and find a guild that will help. Based on what they are saying they won’t even make a raid 2. They are just interested in helping themselves.
---
You literally need to get to the portal one time. Then you can just camp there.
---
The hunter part gets me every time i see those bindings
---
1) Shut up and take it
---
2) Kill them
---
3) Play a different server
---
If the minimap icon is red, then session is stopped. Right click it to resume session, it will then start tracking everything.
---
Your argument is bad. If they don’t do anything, then your entire ally raid will be online but will never even reach the raid instance because there are now 2x as many horde blocking the entrance as in vanilla.
---
Oh, nice one! You really showed my there. Solid argument, mature and smart!
---
well it's a hunter item too
---
I think the part we are all looking past are those tips at the bottom are hilarious. Refreshed over and over just to keep reading them.
---
Same here. I'm 55 Gnome lock, logging in with a desire to quest in Winterspring, EPL, and WPL, but get only chased by 60s right after landing at FP. Really frustrating.
---
Even in IF I got ganked by 4 UD rogues...

Horde player? 😅
---
In the hopes that you become a less awkward person. Consider it charity.
---
It's art directly related to WoW classic though
---
You dont replace devilsaur until you get raid gloves and pants. You could do 6 PC shadowcraft along with 2pc devilsaur and its nearly as good, in some cases better than the accepted pre bis
---
You can, but not the other way around.
---
Nah macro mocking blow to change to battle stance first, then put it on your bar so it's available in defensive stance. Mocking blow is really just a last resort taunt and you usually want to use it while in defensive stance.
---
Bdf represent
---
Nah it's dying because it's not real PvP. Just an excuse for shit tier players to farm lowbies.
---
thats a copout reply tbh.
---
We have been warned about what the phases would contain prior to the game being released. We all knew what we were in for.  Everyones heard of streamers, people knew a lot of players would grind to 60 fast.
---
Pleading ignorance to it all is a cop out.
---
The one person advocating for personal choice is getting downvoted...
---
Depends how lucky you get with finding Star Rubies and Uncommon items in the lockboxes. Also depends on what spec you are. A sub spec is going to be much faster.
---
But on average id say you can get 30g/h when you get in the groove
---
I dont use addons and I hate spy. Other people just auto-shouting where everyone is is so fucking dumb.
---
So be it! I know the numbers speak for themselves on how many horde there are VS alliance, and anecdotes are not evidence, but so far for me I can't imagine it's any better for one team over the other when it comes to getting ganked as a 48-59 by a team of 60s, if anything allys have a better time because there are more nublings to slaughter.
---
Of course the horde eventually catches up
---
They can both spin up new Realms, add authentic Vanilla caps and enable transfers easily. They really have no excuse for not doing so.
---
This reeks of you think you do, but you don't.
---
I'm quite enjoying it. WPVP exists outside of hundreds of people AOE'ing in Hillsbrad. You should check it out.
---
There aren’t servers to choose from. You’ve got a majority that are horde favored and a couple that are alliance favored because everyone form those servers transferred there. Both are terrible choices for everyone. 
---
Even if I was horde I’d hate the huge imbalance. I’m on board with a 60/40 imbalance but that’s not what it is these days. Basically all contested area is horde territory now on my server.
---
whats wrong with people? op tried to prepare for a raid. that makes him a good raider, not a bad one.
---
im really sorry for every guild- and raidlead who puts in effort only to be let down by such terrible and lazy members.
---
no wonder most of your raids take 3 hours.
---
Talk to the dude's guild master. I have a hard time believing a GM in "one of the oldest guilds" would wish to harbour a player like that. Huge idiot.
---
At the same time, in general if people leave the new version for an older version of the game, then clearly something is wrong with the new version
---
Fuck no.  Go back to retail.
---

I use mostly cloth and leather and I end up having 591 healing as a shaman and then im not even using trinkets with any healing. So not sure why you feel 450 is a lot. Druid Pre-raid BiS for healing is like 520 without enchants.
---
You think there was no PvP in AV in Vanilla? Come on man.
---
Cool. So specifically, could you level yesterday? Did you see raid groups of horde honor farming 50s yesterday? Or do you agree that there were groups of allies controlling the 50 leveling zones? Thanks in advance.
---
Fun is subjective buddy. 
---
In fact, some people even get into unfun things as long as the payoff will be amazing at the end.
---
No I still really enjoy the game, phase 2 just really changed the world.. of warcraft
---
Where on the honor tab is that located? Idk if im blind or what but Inhave nothing there.
---
Well have fun because if you are so wise about all the shit that happened in a 15 year old game you also know how many people quit because of people like you. 
---
And then people like you bitched about not having anyone to gank and that your servers are dead and overpopulated with one faction to the point where opening AQ gates was impossible and your queues were horrendous and you begged Blizzard to solve these issues for you.
---
i was super against DM early, and im super against this too.
---
world pvp is designed to allow mages and hunters to hit higher ranks before melee.
---
obviously theres no way a mage could beat a warrior on equal footing in a battle ground. So mages get to have some time to rank up ahead of the warriors and get better pvp gear.
---
This guy gets it
---
I agree with this but blizz won’t release bgs early. Blizz will implement dungeon finder before they implement bgs early.
---
I think the world pvp is awesome. Let’s quit rushing to add things!!
---
Yeah, go play alliance Fairbanks lmao.
---
I don't feel superior at all. 
---
Common sense apparently isn't too common. 
---
More people playing = higher server population or make more servers. 
---
What sounds more cost effective for a buisness?
---
Yeah Jesus. The poor Kobolds!
---
Because ganking a lowbie gives no honour, and many people aren't going to be willing or able to put in 12+ hours each day to try to farm honour.
---
These massive fights are because of the hype. They will die down and become much more sporadic.
---
The honour farmers will be fewer and farther between, and they'll likely also move to zones where the questers give them honour.
---
Thanksgiving weekend is my guess
---
Use Mongoose bite if you miss. And when you hit feign death make a FD + FT makro.
---
Watch some Youtube vids about Hunter PvP. I learned most stuff there.
---
there is a version of WoW that does this
---
Is 52 an OK level for BRD? Sorry, asking as a ganked-all-day 52 myself
---
Once these idiots realize they're getting like 3 honor a kill in these raids they will stop. Then only the griefers who were already doing it will be left.
---
Rofl the only people I know who bitch about Spy are the noobs
---
Plus the servers are bigger now.
---
It’s not common sense if you never played private servers.  Not everyone was researching and planning.  The pvp I was originally on was nothing like this. Again, classic is from 15 years ago, not everyone is a sweaty vanilla pserver player drooling over dev AMA’s.
---
The average player back then was late 20s early 30s actually. They released demographics. I think it was 29 for males and 31 for females.
---
If your guild is using meters as a benchmark then your leadership is bad.  There’s way too many things meters don’t account for.
---
Takes 6 seconds to drop combat after a gouge, with imp gouge talent you gouge for a total of 5.5 seconds. So you can restealth if you don’t take dmg in the 0.5 sec after the gouge wears off. You shouldn’t be able to restealth during a gouge though without vanish.
---
Because alcohol by weight is different, if minimally. They must have correct labeling.
---
From my understanding ranking points aren’t relative to honor gained by others. Only the higher officer ranks have limited slots (based on population), which require you to gain more than others. But there’s a minimum points requirement necessary to get to ranks? So there won’t be able to be a HWL/GM next week. If the spreadsheets are correct (tbh, chances are high they aren’t if they pserver based), the amount needed to get to HWL won’t be possible with having to maraud around.  If the other faction just had a constant line of fresh characters walking up to you and feeding you, sure. But that ain’t happening.
---
it happened in vanilla there were just less players.
---
Fd is lvl 30 actually
---
Doing arena and angerforge it's decent,  you'll be carried somewhat but 60s need the hoj so you should be able to find groups
---
There are too many raids standing around flight masters making the game generally obnoxious during peak hours on non raid nights.... the solution is to escort a low level alt to the flight points and then later on when the idiot raids show up, keep running your low level into the aoe spam fest and feed them dk’s and they’ll get the message real quick to move it along.
---
This is why the fabled TM vs SS battles of beta and early vanilla started stopping once the honor system was implemented - they are mid level leveling zones and you can rack up a bunch of dishonorable kills by participating which makes any pvp rank chasers leave as fast as possible.
---
No changes I thought! Wasn’t everyone ranting and raving about that? I also don’t play retail so I’m not salty just pointing out the truths.
---
You knew this was coming and telling you specifically when wouldn't have made you level or prepare any faster and if you say otherwise you're lying.
---
How's that?
---
Who cares? Farm 30g in 30minutes +mats.
---
Why would you flash heal a tank?
---
hah i play on mograine as horde and i feel same, in prime hours its pain in ass to do anything else than dungeons or pvp zerg farming. In morning its much better, fairly questing with occasional pvp and rare small pt gankers but like that it should be with thier prime hours. They have to thin out population by enabling layers again or restricting servers population (this last one sux but its better than current situation)
---
What you don't understand is that battlegrounds won't change anything with this server population and player min maxing mentality. There's still going to be enough people on populated servers to gank and camp in open world while waiting in queue for BG and battlegrounds themselves is another type of cancer you yet to experience. Enjoy.
---
Oh dear. This poor guy has probably been chatting with the other faction via /emote and thought it would work all this time :DDDD
---
A guildie asked me to heal 2 princess runs. We got the look he wanted and I dinged. Hoping to spam BRD tonight.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;It will go back to how things were once the novelty wears off.
---
It will not. Rank 14 weapons are too good. And when p3 comes - suddenly all Alliance is on PvE servers and BG queues for ally there are 4h+, while all Horde is on PvP servers and experiencing the same queue times, because they queue with another PvP realms.
---
If you have the chance to engage, you shouldn’t loose against a rogue as a hunter, conc shot his sprint get distance with cheetah, serpent sting to be sure he won’t vanish/stealth, put a trap on the ground before engaging as you won’t have fd until lvl 30 anyway, and auto attacks/sting should kill him pretty easily
---
Édit: if he somehow manage to get on you, wing clip and try to get some distance, if he use poison on his dagger to slow you, stoneform and try to move, distance is the key to succès against melee as hunter
---
If you can even get to the dungeon...
---
&gt;Bring a resto druid that's going to do very little, healing wise.
---
That's utter nonsense. Yes restos have a mana issue right now, but with enough consumables, runes, innervates, resto druids will outheal all palas and most priests.
---
Yeah I figured that was the case. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Private servers went in waves. Most people played alliance in vanilla so it's natural more want to try horde this time around. Whenever a private server went with a new server, the opposite faction of the previous server turned dominant a lot of the times, it was still like 55 45 so nothing like we have now.
---
I’m here to powergame the fuck out of classic and spy fits the bill perfectly.
---
This iteration is about pushing the game to its limits, not about bumbling around feeling like Einstein because you are able to manually /target someone being cute.
---
As a warrior you will need every tool you have. Use it.  
---
You can beat mages that are not using these tools (like most mages).
---
But if they are using extra tools then you are fucked.
---
They seem to misremember the zerging strat that came in TBC (mainly Wrath though) was prevalent in Vanilla. Even with the nerfs, it wasn’t a crazy zerg but less of a slog (multi-day fights get old after a while).
---
Yes and that's not the AV they are adding. They are adding the nerfed baserace AV.
---
https://youtu.be/74OtsKeHum0
---
Yeah take that learn boy. Enjoy your learning.
---
Tell that to Thorium Point, 1-2 horde raids there, 1 on the road catching the few that slip away, and a couple more inside BRM making sure we need to make at least 3 corpse runs to get into MC or BRD. Can't do much on the east side of the gorge either, because Kargath is there and has a literally endless stream of high lvl horde riding in every day at all hours.
---
Gadgetzan was overrun with horde long before P2 and only got worse now, can barely leave town, if they don't safespot and gank you anyways IN town.
---
Hinterlands is camped in and out of town pretty bad.
---
Duskwood always had at least 1 ganker there every day, now it's a bunch more because 2/3rds of our low lvl zones are contested vs the giant-ass Horde-Zone Barrens that covers the same level stretch with 3 dungeons too; then there's the roof exploiters in town, too.
---
Scarlet Monastery is a popular dungeon to lvl and gear up at around 30-40, but again, horde zone, our nearest flight path is the one you tell us to avoid and that's already fucking 3 zones away and at a level that's pre-mount too so it's a walk and a swim, usually, slowing it down even more. Even when you get there, surprise, another horde raid!
---
I mean I can go on. I dunno what server you're on, but mine was originally a 50/50 split, now it seems to be 65/35 favoring horde and it shows in EVERY zone.
---
Here, here. Especially while having the option to choose said faction but taking the opposite. Nobody forced their faction pick, they made that decision themselves.
---
It's a secret bestowed upon us by the Tauren and their Barn ways...
---
Way to group all Americans into one group there... and you want me to believe you’re not the asshole. Also, how do you know he’s American?
---
how about questie? auction addons? DBM? Threat meter? trinket menus? if you dont have these youre also behind by default
---
I wasn't leveling in level 50 zones, but I never fly to thorium point or burning steppes FP because there is always horde waiting. Horde pretty much controls thorium point/burning steppes whenever I go there.
---
There is nothing strategic unless you try things like flanking or sending your stealths into the back of the line.
---
Or, check out real tactics which are totally viable in these hillsbrad attrition fights:
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_formation
---
Checkout the Vee - leaves them thinking they're getting flanked on both sides while your main force hits both halves from behind.
---
*never* underestimate the power of a flank.

---
**Tactical formation**
---
A moari tactical formation (or order) is the arrangement or deployment of moving military forces such as infantry, cavalry, AFVs, military aircraft, or naval vessels. Formations were found in tribal societies such as the "lucid kiki" of the Māori, and ancient or medieval formations which include shield walls (skjaldborg in Old Norse), phalanxes (lines of battle in close order), Testudo formation and skirmishers. 
---
Tactical formations include:
---
Column
---
Line
---
Square
---
Wedge and inverted wedge
---
Echelon
---
Vee
---
Staggered column
---
Coil
---
HerringboneA vanguard is the forward element of a column formation, and the rear-guard is the rear-most element of the column formation. 
---
In naval use only "van" and "rear" are applied to a formation of ships sailing in column.

Agree, using a spy addon makes you a fucking parasite.
---
And they were not prepared!!!
---
You do realize that both sides are literally the same shit right?
---
Not gonna lie... Was laughing my ass off as I put it in the video XD
---
Boohoo
---
On my server my friends, 53 and 57, are getting gang banged by alliance in every zone they try to level. Especially goblin towns.
---
Oh man, it's really embarassing how you're trying to act smart yet you fail to realise that the vast majority of data collected and presented is in someway inherently flawed as perfectly capturing data is not always feasible. 
---
Even in the scientific community we accept a margin for error and the sheer amount of people who have answered recent surveys such as the wowhead one or the reddit one is significant enough that it can be accepted as a rough estimation of server population.
---
you're being unessecarily hostile towards the gathered information when it is accurate to a reasonable degree for the intended purpose.
---
Grow up you fucktard
---
Same situation here. My guild just re rolled horde on incendius and the leveling community still seems really active, never takes long to find a group for dungeons.
---
Try reading the context of the conversation before responding... they're saying basically the same thing as you
---
In before someone with negative IQ says "thats what you signed up for."
---
I'm not completely abandoning the server. I have like 12 days on my character already lmao I'm not gonna throw that away. I have a glimmer of hope that the server will become playable after the Horde realizes 40 man raids and camping people isnt the best way to get honor, and that they are going to have no chance of reaching rank 11+ since they outnumber us so big and have inner-faction competition for ranking.
---
I just like to play WoW after work and on weekends, and it seems unplayable outside of my pre-determined raid times of Tu/Th at 830pm EST. 
---
I want something to do in the game outside of those times and open world stuff is unplayable on my server unless you're Horde.
---
I always planned on making an alt, just wanted my epic mount on my main first. Getting the money for that isn't feasible right now given the state of the open world. Figured I'd just expedite my alt process.
---
&gt; If you're Horde you can hit lvl25 without stepping into contested  territory or spamming dungeons and if you're happy running dungeons you  can easily hit 40 with zero PVP. 
---
Too bat both these numbers are 10 lvls lower as Alliance.
---
\#nochanges-except-for-changes-*I*-want
---
i found same, 2 days ago i zerged for about 1-2 hours and got less honor than after random 6 kills yesterday during questing
---
Fair point about ST, although I likely overlooked it bc it’s not my preferred favorite dungeon. And I meant waiting til about 55 for BRD and then leveling to 60 there.
---
I chose a smaller guild that’s going to grow into raiding. Feels more familial but with end game upside. A lot of the smaller guilds join forces to pug MC until they have enough players to go solo, but it’s good for me bc I don’t feel like i have to have perfect attendance otherwise i’m taking someone’s spot. The bigger guilds are less ok with that in general.
---
Also worth checking out the Hydramist Deathblind guide (especially if alliance). It’s the single best priest guide out there. Hands down 
---
https://deathblind.com/alliance-leveling-guide/
---
I assume in a couple years many players will be maxed out and calling for TBC update.  Classic+ is an idea, but it's controversial and would cost Blizzard more money, while TBC is highly popular and would be a good way to maintain subs after Shadowlands.
---
Sounds like an exploit and you just posted Exhibit A for those poor alliance bastards haha - good cow pun though ;)
---
I honestly haven't played in weeks, i've got a level 60 and a few other mid levels and im basically just want bgs now, i'm bored of everything else
---
okay this is not how the addon works. it wont pop up someones name in stealth unless they preform an action in stealth like eating or applying poisons
---
Game isn’t dead, very active!
---
&gt; You'd think they would know a lot of players actually wanted this, since players have been screaming for Classic WoW for ages. This kinda just proves they only listen a tiny bit
---
It proves Blizzard thought they knew better than their fans. They expected us to play for a few hours, miss dungeon finder, and log back over to retail.
---
Meanwhile I've just about got my second character to 60 and I can't remember the last time I had this much fun playing an MMO.
---
It's not that they didn't hear the screams, its that they are so far up their own asses they can't smell their own shit anymore.
---
The game world was designed for X number of players, we seem to have at least X * 5.  Overcrowding is a huge problem in nearly all areas.
---
We're actually beta testing a progression server/seasonal server idea.  I'm glad people are voicing their opinion so they can make adjustments.  Blizzard isn't going to drop this cash cow at the end of the current phase cycle.  I expect in 3-5 years having a rotation of servers being dropped that keep players coming back.  If you don't believe me, look at how Everquest 1&amp;2, Project 1999, Anarchy Online and others have handled their progression servers.
---
Your first kill?
---
Currently a lvl 60 gives 199 honor, which is split between contributors.
---
op thinks only 10% of players will stay, we dont need to make stupid comments like thats what you signed up for, OP has a negative IQ
---
This is when you want to be in remote places in zones like Azshara that's hard to navigate. Gank squads don't want to deal with that outside of camping the Hydraxian Duke to grief people from getting waters.  Un Goro, Tanaris, Blasted Lands are all too wide open and gank squads can easily ride around.  You want to level in places with really fucked up terrain.
---
HTH
---
What are you talking about, though? It goes Paladin, Priest, Shaman, Druid. Do you honestly think druid is the best healer? Do you even pay attention to parses?
---
Yeah that's what I'm thinking too. 
---
I'm currently playing dagger spec though, using CHT in MH and distracting dagger in OH until i get perd blade.
---
The census addon doesn’t work anymore so that website is 100% useless and inaccurate.
---
If you don't feel superior, then you should stop talking down to people, because it gives the impression that you feel superior to them.
---
There was no way for players to predict how many people would play classic, and even if there were, you can't reasonably expect players to piece together random clues to reach risky decisions like intentionally rolling on a server marked "low pop."
---
If Blizzard insisted upon changing the vanilla definitions of low, medium and high pop servers, they should have taken responsibility by drawing more attention to it. Blizzard literally named "authenticity" as classic's design philosophy, so it's reasonable for players to be confused as to why that didn't include server pop.
---
A bit late but I was wondering if there's a way to get the first macro to work without it saying "spell is not ready" when using ctrl to downrank?
---
I play on whitemane, they have a lot of Taiwan players horde side that still camp all around. Can’t even play the game at 4am server time.
---
This is the same guy that only attacks when he knows he'll win, 100% guaranteed. In groups versus one, or when someone has mobs on them. You can smell it on his fat greasy fingers.
---
It's super fun playing as alliance on a PVP server right now.  Literally anywhere I fly to on Stalagg I'm ganked the moment I land.
---
&gt; world pvp is designed to allow mages and hunters to hit higher ranks before melee.
---
Lol, thanks for that very funny joke!
---
What was the reward for turning in mats? I mean....nobody gets shit for free.
---
You know you can pvp in groups of 5 right? You don't have to mindlessly join giant raids in hillsbard. The wpvp is amazing and if you're not enjoying it it's likely because you suck or don't have 4 friends
---
When the threat values for each ability was a bit of a mystery pve was cool.
---
Then we got meters which took out the guess work
---
&gt;If you agree that Blizz jacked up the server sizes too high at the expense of everything else like basic resources, then how in the world is that the players fault?
---
There were ample opportunities (some that still exist) to transfer to smaller realms. Anyone that VOLUNTARILY stayed has no right to complain about it. 
---
&gt;Most people wanted the "authentic vanilla experience," were we all supposed to just roll on servers marked on low pop and somehow know that actually meant high pop in vanilla terms?
---
There was a statement (the one I referenced in my first post) made by blizzard very early in the process of name reservations. People knew that medium population now had more than the highest in vanilla. 
---
&gt;Your reasoning is so backward. This is literally a new problem that Blizzard created despite the playerbase being as vocal as possible about "no changes."
---
Nope. A lot of these problems are due to players. Take a little responsibility. I know it's easy to just point the finger.
---
i died about 10 times in ungoro and gave up on the map
---
Mara is probably a bit low. But ST is at the perfect level for them to easily heal and still get decent do and gear. Plus it is much less of a pain to get to than anything in BRM. 
---
I do find the people complaining about hour+ runs to BRM silly due to the fact that almost every class has something they can use to survive a bit between death runs and/or boost themselves forward. But the walk to ST would still probably be quicker due to the lack of centralized aggression that BRM contains.
---
My mistaken what?
---
World PvP is one of the best parts of this game, and BGs severely drop its presence. Why bring them out sooner? 
---
If you didn't want WPvP, why did you even roll on a pvp server? Anyone complaining about leveling right now on a PvP server can transfer off - but seriously, they knew what they were getting into.
---
I don't agree exactly, my server "Herod" is almost unplayable for the alliance side unless your intention is to pvp. Roaming deathballs 24/7 ganking non-stop we are outnumbered almost 7-3 and all horde do is hunt alliance. I'm a pvp players so this is fine for me but almost all flight paths are 24/7 camped with 5+ people it feels terrible to just want to do some open world action.
---
Generally a guild that lists itself as a raiding guild will not invite characters who are leveling. 
---
If you're just starting, look for a guild that describes itself as a social guild or a levelling guild.
---
I would advise joining a larger guild, as morr people on means more chance at getting help, advice, and conversation.
---
Don't be shy, be sure to chat in gchat; the banter is what keeps a guild from feeling dead, and the social ties are what makes guild progression feel satisfying.
---
All the same people? How do you know? I am in the first camp and but not in your second. You're simply projecting your opinion on a population which you are not tracking. Who is more likely to comment at the moment, someone who is salty af or someone who is loving and playing the game?
---
Are you seriously that stupid to believe the amount of corpse camp is same in an evenly split server and 30/70 server? I am guessing yes.
---
Wasn't me.
---
Because getting ganked by higher lvl players is PvP that people want. /s
---
Putting 3-7 times the number of players on the servers sure doesn't help. Everything is overcrowded. They should just limit the servers to 3000 and create more servers. I can't remember the last time I was able to find whipper root spawns etc. Even at 4am every node of everything is farmed consistently. Every pvp skirmish turns into 10 players instantly because the zones are over populated. I much preferred small skirmishes of 1v1 1v2 or 2v2 etc. Everything devolves into lopsided zergs within 30 seconds because everyone is stacked on top of each other with 3x+ player density.
---
Hey all, question about Grid2.
---
How do I get it so my buffs grow to the right when I have multiple buffs under one indicator? For example, I have Inner Fire and PW: Fortitude on Icon:Left. However, when I cast them both, they are stacked right on top of each other. I want them to spread out to the right. Thanks!
---
on my server alliance are not any better
---
Nah, the mafia types who farm devilsaur leather rn will be the ones holding the keys to rank 14. 
---
I can't wait to see the burnout. And the QQ on here and In the discords lol.
---
As long as it's not the nerfed AV that gets released. No one wants to play that's 5 min baserace.
---
You could still escape it in vanilla. You could find a zone that was empty. With classic increased server population this is no longer the case.
---
It won’t change when he is or is not in range
---
Okay thanks, think I missed that context.
---
I'm with you and be surprised if blizzard didn't turn on WSG in a few weeks, This current meta isn't sustainable.
---
I'm having fun running around in 1-3 man squads. I hate that people are begging to sit in capital cities queuing, might as well be retail at that point. Sit in city, only run out when you go to raid. how boring.
---
You just said it was common sense to read dev AMA’s and decide on a population where you wanted to play.  That’s planning and researching.
---
There's a guy alliance side in Herod that does this too, different macro though it seems
---
Anyone who thinks this is overkill on consumables is an idiot. If everyone comes prepared, the raid is over much faster.
---
1. It's new - people have yet to really remember how shitty the ranking system is. There's going to be bands of gank squads for a couple weeks until they realize they don't want to actually want to continue ranking and will look for more even fights.
---
2. You aren't supposed to be handed small, even fights every minute.
---
3. The whole point is that it's unfair.. if you organize more players you'll win PvP pugfights
---
4. WoW combat was never designed around more than 20 players. Of course it's going to be centered around ranged classes.
---
5. You can, in fact, find 1v1s
---
This is a dad game. References on point.
---
I have it, I use it as a kill on sight reminder.
---
ok then they should limit server capacity like in vanilla to, and im happy. there is too many zergs that are too big
---
I love you. #BattlegroundsForChristmas
---
Dishonorable kills are only for low level pvp enabled npc's. Killing a level 25 player character as a level 60 does nothing. You get no honor and no dk.
---
There are no fight that can blow you up and fights are way too short for you to go oom. Max spell damage all the way.
---
Guilds are killing MC bosses sub 20 seconds now.
---
That's cool. Keep stepping on your own feet while looking for someone else to blame for it.
---
Foolish to pass. Perditioners Blade is a spec definining item... meaning you go daggers if you get it.
---
yeah that's pretty much the best option. don't really see many negatives to doing so
---
No I didn't? I watched a highlight video on YouTube from an asmongold stream.
---
ClassicCensusPlus counts 12k online concurrently on my Realm during prime time. It is listed as High and has no queue.
---
We split raid. Our other raids this week was filled with casters, it's usually rather balanced.
---
Where the ratios are 3:1 or worse i guarantee in 7/10 zones these "strike forces" will soon get swamped real fast
---
Not on a PvP server.
---
Faction balance has been a problem for 15 years, what makes you think it's gonna be magically fixed because classic released?
---
Wpvp is pretty fun on my pve server. Since its opt in, everyone organizes huge battles in between south shore and tarren mill.
---
I'd imagine he finds it hard to get a group for brd at 54. People know there are plenty of mid 50s higher than 54 available for runs
---
No joke, that's how you had to do it to be efficient. 
---
IE once the group starts moving in a big raid after loot, if you don't have Mana you get to drink mage water while everyone moves and pulls - so you learn to hit the button, get a few sips and keep going pretty much the second you are out of combat. Sip sip, run, sip sip, run.
---
The message was all over reddit.  
---
The complaints I'm talking about are on reddit.  
---
There isn't much of a disconnect. The message was here. People ignored it. If the message was made on some obscure message board and never posted here I could see it. It wasn't though. It was plastered all over the same subreddit we're talking on now. Unless the people making complaints only started reading it today, they have no excuse.
---
Mostly yeah, because of the stealth detection function, but I've also seen people complaining about it from not being able to sneak up on people or hide a raid in a building or something that otherwise would go unnoticed. Goes hand in hand with the rogue's complaint really though.
---
World PvP has been exciting for me. My guild will take 20 or so people to BRM and kill the horde camping there. Then we hold BRM for other guilds until a huge horde wave comes in to wipe us out. 
---
Then we are forced to scatter into kill squads, picking off the stragglers until enough alliance group up and we storm the mountain again. If there aren't enough alliance, we call on another guild and go to war. 
---
Got into about a 60v60 in searing gorge with no lag and it was a proper battle.
---
I also hold choke points between two zones with 3-5 people until the horde group up to wipe us out. 
---
So my take: World PvP is fun.
---
For people who can't level 50-60 right now, you knew WPvP was coming. You should have hit 60 faster, or be leveling a lower alt (STV is empty on my server), or coordinate over world/defense chats on where enemy groups are and either avoid that area or rally up a kill squad. 
---
I understand it sucks when the enemies occupy a city...but it's a game about warfare. If you want to quest without the looming threat of war, play PvE or some single player game.
---
Early battlegrounds will kill world PvP for ONE SIDE. Whoever has the longer queues will go out hunting noobs while they wait, while the side with short queues will just jump into BGs and stand in city. Right now, the weaker faction still has incentive to group up and defend the little guy.
---
&gt; This is the only one that will be irreparably affected and largely replaced by battlegrounds.
---
People keep saying this. You realize that means _most_ players think this phase is shit, right?
---
"As soon as people have ANY alternative to this shit, they'll stop putting up with this shit. Thats awful! We must keep this terrible un-fun shit that everyone hates around as long as possible, because as soon as they can do something else thats actually fun they'll stop doing things that arent fun!!!"
---
Well said. We need more communication from blizzard and definitely faction changes fo lr the horde players who want to balance the game. Blizzard needs to do something about this or I feel the servers that are heavy horde the remaining alliance players will disappear. 
---
Faction change and balance queues would fix this issue.
---
I think instead you can balance the racial traits so it will encourage people to play the opposite faction and not making a faction ridiculously strong and except people to play the weak one
---
I mean they are literally advertised as "LFM BRD Full Clear"  dont sign up for arena runs and expect to be able to convince people to keep killing other bosses.
---
Not Grob, but I usually hop on around 5am server and play as I get ready for work. It's a nice time to be questing.
---
Yeah i doubt that unless they were 10 hour sessios. What was your played time at 60.
---
Gehennas guilds dodged progress mate...
---
 I am prepared to get downvoted heavily but my opinion is the following:
---
I have the feeling some people are just unable to adapt into different strategies for leveling in the 50-60 area. Yes there is a lot of FP camping and people kill you instantly.. but this will be over in a few weeks and people knew what they choose when they created a character on a pvp realm. So maybe these effected lvl 50-60 players could just adapt into dungeon leveling for the last few levels.
---
If you are lvl 60 and created your character on a pvp realm.. this should mean you're interested in world pvp. Why else whould you create a character on a realm. If you wish to just play BGs, there is no restriction in playing on a pve realm. If people get mad about player blobs and large zergs... just avoid zones like hillsbrad/blackrock OR form your own groups and join the small scale pvp fun (5-10ppl). It feels rewarding and brings the WARcraft into the "world of warcraft". I play on alliance side, we are outnumbered 75 H vs. 35% alliance on my server and it's easily possible to participate in interesting small scale world pvp.
---
There are a lot of people who enjoy this "phase" and classic wpvp. Why would you take these few weeks away from them?
---
No one have fully accurate data but it’s pretty easy to figure out when virtually every contested zone in the game is horde controlled.
---
After the last two days - I regret PVP server.
---
And herbing/mining. Lots of nodes in those earlier hours.
---
Yes, we need them within like a month of now.
---
Haha what has happened?
---
PvP realms are skilled in PvP like Germans are in speaking German; PvE realms are skilled in PvP like American high schoolers that took a few years of German. Sure, the PvE realms might win once in a while, but PvP realms are immersed in it, and are so experienced that there's almost no competition 90% of the time. Unless, of course, PvE realms organize into premades, which is exactly what will happen regardless of realm, and then it's going to be premades murdering PUGs, and the pugs will eventually die down, leading to win-trading premades.
---
That's cool, keep being rude and snide to your fellow WoW players. Maybe one day you'll find your intellectual equal.
---
What faction and class are you? And what's the faction ratio on your server?
---
A compromise implies that both sides work together for an amicable solution. What you describe is me giving up everything I want. That is not a compromise. Good try though I guess?
---
I was leveling my 51 warrior yesterday in a few different zones and all of them had relentless gank groups murder me about every 5 minutes. 
---
Burning steppes was the worst, and I was killed and camped nearly the entire time. Sometimes by 1 60, but more often by 5+. 
---
WPL was almost as bad which took me about 20 minutes to get away from chill wind camp to quest. But even after that, one rogue seemed to follow me for another 30 minutes and two shot me everytime I attacked a mob. After that finally ended, the roaming death squads killed me about every 8 minutes. 
---
The hinterland was actually pretty good to me, but at that level I only had two quests to do here. And once I got to the east coast, I seemed to have found 10+ individual players who were more than happy to gank me on sight as I tried to score my picture of gammertia. 
---
It took me about 8 hours to get from 51.3 to 52. I bring all of this up only as a point of argument that if I were a casual player and didn't already have a 60, I would 100% quit the game. There is nothing fun about this. I can't imagine it's fun for others either, aside from the spergs like the 60 rogue who followed me for 30 minutes. Hillsbrad isn't fun either, because it's all about who get luckier with their lag spike. 
---
The only fun tk be had is the 5v5 or the 10v10 fights that randomly happen, but as soon as one side loses, they call for backup, and it instantly turns into another 20+v10 stomp fest. This type of ranking isnt about challenge or skill, it's about having more numbers so your time to kill is lower. 
---
This game needs bgs, or it will lose a lot of casual players.
---
This is such an ignorant reduction of the situation. There are 3-7 times the number of players on each server than the game was designed around. How about they just make 5x the number of servers and limit the populations to 3000 so that I can actually world pvp for more than 30 seconds before 10 friendlies or enemies show up because we're all on top of each other all the time.
---
server imbalance is horrible because they opened up with a small number of realms. Its not fun to pvp when there are 3 horde for each ally.
---
It's still a great idea. The dominant faction needs some negative encouragement to transfer off.
---
What do we want?
---
BATTLEGROUNDS!
---
When do we want it?
---
Yesterday....
---
No thank you.
---
What server are u on?
---
Not what I said moron.
---
[Oh Really???] (https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=8660&amp;so=oldest#info)
---
&gt;Paranoia works by **scanning all incoming combat log entries** for any event caused by a hostile player.
---
You were saying?
---
\**dances in moonkin**
---
Why are WoW players like this
---
I’m saying it’s so unbalanced it’s most likely a variation of 70/30, 75/25, or 80/20. We don’t have the ability to gather 100% data, but you generally have 7-8 horde per 1 alliance on Fairbanks.
---
You rolled on a pvp server and after 3 days of actual world pvp you are crying for phase 3.  It's becoming more and more obvious that Blizzard didn't ruin wow, the community did.
---
Let me tell you one thing. One doesn't get HWL or the alliance equivalent by playing alone :P And that's the point we've been pointing out. That in a 1v1 or 1vx scenario, warriors suck UNLESS you outgear them by a gazillion. But with a healer in their back, they are fucking sick.
---
It’s bad... it’s really bad. 
---
Don’t be alliance if you are going PvP ... or better yet, go PVE. 
---
It’s been camping of flight points and boat harbors - unable to travel anywhere.  Not fun at all, and zero chance of fighting back.
---
That would mean removing the combat log from the game. Nooot gonna happen.
---
That's because they dont want to get stomped in world pvp.
---
It's a game, which allows for people to be shitheads for no reason without bringing actual harm to another human. Games that don't have infamous guilds or clans are boring.
---
Are you trying to say there isnt a large pool of people who might have found it a tough ask to fit in the reauired time to hit 60 before p2?
---
It's still a meme spec, it's just that they determined that in a highly tuned, mostly melee raid doing a speed run, it was the best druid spec. 
---
That doesn't mean it's a good spec for most players. Even the player that ran it admits he did basically no effective damage and was there for the utility.
---
In most environments and guilds, the boomkin is not worth taking over any other dps.
---
See you say that...
---
Still playing Horde though, so no flightmaster but two in the game has mass amounts of guards surrounding it. Play Ally on a 35/65 split server and every flightmaster in the game is camped due to only 3 of them having a few guards. PSA: Don't play ally on minority servers :)
---
Aren't you that BRE-wielding Lionheart-helmed orc warrior who can\`t win against my valor set/vendorstrike cause you\`re getting disarmed all the time? You and your friends surely showed me yesteray in EPL... Too bad I executed you before they killed me, lol.
---
Undoubtedly its more useful for melee, but the AP on it makes it prebis for hunters too
---
It sounds like you'll never be satisfied, so good luck with life pal.
---
Then they have the option to transfer.
---
The first idea isn't bad. The second idea seems horrible.
---
Using queue times to influence behavior isn't a bad idea because those queues were already there.
---
Creating a queue for players strictly in the name of "balance" is a horrible idea.
---
We want fewer queues not more. If there has to be queue then giving some prioritization for the massively outnumbered side seems to be a way to help reduce queues in the future.
---
Creating queues just to create balance increases queues in the future.
---
 I had to give up playing WoW and moved to SWTOR because the game is unplayable if you're leveling right now.
---
I'm new to classic but why do warlocks have to die? :(
---
Is this a means of being unlucky or is it constantly like that? Will it cool down over time?
---
Not launching with battlegrounds was THE dumbest decision in Classic so far.
---
The problem is it makes things disproportionately harder for certain classes and not others. Calling out someone ENTERING stealth is just unfair and moves the game closer to the SPAM AOE style of retail.
---
I guess you haven’t read completely. If the ally quits in too big numbers it’s gonna be pointless to play for those 40 hordes too. It’s not just about one person being camped. It’s not fun for the whole faction, believe me. You will see the numbers in a month or so if nothing changes and see what i meant. 
---
Also if you think that this is fun you obviously haven’t experienced it. This is not pvp.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
It's a month old and not perfect but it's the best we got.
---
Im repeating myself but nothing has made me hate the game more than the last 3 days. Unless you want to pvp the game is unplayable in most zones that are 40lvl+ and absolutely unplayable in any zone that is 50+.
---
Let’s hope it cools down... but the amount of players today vs vanilla is making this very unplayable.
---
&gt; This skip is new
---
&gt;  and not really seen too much in the private server seen.
---
thats not new. we did that was MC was on farm back in vanilla, just running normally
---
a 15 year old game is getting boring already? im so shocked guys
---
fc
---
He literally said he want to transfer off a PvP server and he's mad blizzard lied to him.  He chose to roll on a pvp server and is now mad he is on a pvp server.
---
I do understand you are mad about something, but what you don't understand is that what you are mad about is a product of player behavior.  It doesn't matter how high pop the servers are, players will still roll there if they can.  The only solution was to cap the pop, and all that would lead to is more people bitching about "dead" servers.  I literally went through all of this in vanilla.  I went through this through retail.  Players are going to congregate on the mega servers.  If you can't accept that, then you are simply rejecting reality.
---
The problem is the server population is so much higher there are no 50+ zones that are playable unless you want to pvp. Even if the hype dies out (more or less) the problem will exist. Even battlegrounds might be unable to solve it fully.
---
The only thing with this is that if I wanted to sit in a bg queue I would just play retail.
---
Whats the range on that? Like I said the last week I've had no issues, I just burned through Feralas, Tanaris (not much coverage) and Hinterlands and haven't had 1 person pop behind a tree. /shrug
---
The issue with classic is that everything has devolved into zerg fests because we have like 5 times the number of players on each server. If they'd kept the cap at 3000, I think I would enjoy it much more. I'm tired of every 1v1 turning into a 1v5 or 5v1 within 5 seconds because everyone is playing on top of each other in a way that the game simply was not designed for. I love almost all pvp, but I really miss small skirmishes where players 3v3 each other for 30 minutes killing each other and trading cooldowns. I can't open on anyone as a rogue without 3 others randomly running up in 10 seconds (friendly or enemy) and fights devolving into lopsided zergs one way or the other.
---
How does it feel to just be standing there waiting for that 1 alliance member?
---
99% of the player base does not give a fuck about speed running.
---
It's just parsing the combat logs...
---
I think it's fun. "Oh there's the fucking shithead from the guild &lt;xxxx&gt; let's corpse-camp him to show what's up". It makes the game feel more alive, it makes the world feel more real. A fantasy game about war without a bad guy would be shitty as fuck and kill the immersion.
---
I would agree that horde usually control everything but I think the alliance is way more coordinated. I see a lot of huge co-ordinated alliance raid groups killing everything in higher level zones. Horde are usually massive unorganized pug zerg groups
---
totally agree. Spy needs to be broken by Blizz
---
A level 50ish Mara party vs one geared 60 is actually an awesome fight for both sides.
---
Atiesh really is great. High pop without queues and I've seen WPvP groups forming nonstop since P2 dropped. I was a little worried going PvE since I followed a friend but it's so much better than expected.
---
A most extreme split of 30-70 you’ll only see a tops of 3:1 split. The rest of the servers just have lazy level 60s sitting in IF or SW.
---
No, if you run over a player just sitting afk in stealth it will absolutely announce it to you.
---
The character I'm playing is not my first.  I originally rolled on another server and got to 20 before realizing I am not dealing with those long queue times every day.  So now I'm on a better server.  If you stayed on a 80/20 server it's your own fault.
---
There are literally servers designed to drop opposite faction griefing, why didn’t u roll on one?
---
Does it actually need to be stated? I think it's a given and is pretty much guaranteed to happen.
---
Ganking always happens on both sides, yes, but that’s not the point of this thread. Some servers have extremely unbalanced horde/ally populations, which makes wpvp and ganking almost entirely onesided.
---
People tend to pick the race that gives them the biggest advantages for whatever their goal is. Horde racials are crazy good for pvp, so it’s only natural that horde typically get a higher population (and more pvp oriented players). And ofc, a higher population + more pvp oriented players leads to more hordes going around ganking/farming honor than allies.
---
It sounds like you'd be happier if you quit the game and move on.
---
Atiesh is great ally side. Seems there are plenty of horde too, I'd guess 60/40 at least.
---
they cleared content, that is literally all that matters at this point
---
Honour gains from giant raids is so extremely inefficient that there's zero point in doing it if you want to grind honour.
---
Most of these people actually would be way happier on retail but retail isn't popular this month.  They will get early BGs then they will complain all they do is queue for WSG and then they will drop the game for Fortnite 2 or some shit.
---
What would make it more fun IMO is to break the spy addon and increase draw distance. Would be more fun to use envoirment and not have people spawn right next to you (shitty draw distance) and its not fun to be tracked through walls by that shady addon.
---
Why sleep when you can look for a group and kill Alliance dogs
---
Exactly. 
---
This does not prevent people from running their dicklicker and talking shit if you say that you aren't enjoying that if you make the mistake of leaving a city.
---
Hence, the preemption.
---
Names sound familiar - is that BF? If so I'd blacklist that shammy..
---
As a horde on herod I feel bad for the alliance.
---
Average gamers should’ve rolled pve, if u quit mail me ur stuff
---
&gt;So players who prefer the server they're on and don't mind the queue should be FORCED to either never play Classic again or leave their guilds/raid groups and move to either a dead server or end up having roo many horde guilds come over because half their raid team is locked out that they end up with a queue on the new server and face the same issue.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;...All because they decided to play Horde with their friends and because a couple Alliance are salty that they're not the dominant faction? 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Not only  is by far the stupidest idea of a solution, but also extremely childish and selfish
---
Childish and selfish? Don't make me laugh. Everything you are describing is currently happening to the lower populations. Sorry you are not entitled over the health of a server.  Having to use a queue based on your own faction is extremely fair. Don't like It? Well you at least have the option to leave, unlike the lower population. You can't restrict them to a unbalanced realm and not expect a leverage against the opposing dominant faction to some degree. I don't expect this to make sense to you though, because your ability to look at situations objectively seems nonexistant.
---
even if it gave an ingame achievement speedrunning would still be pointless for 99% of the people playing this game.
---
face it. its not something the general playerbase actually cares about
---
Uh im not quoting something
---
What an original post
---
I'm one of those people and I'm loving it.  I'm partially loving it more because of all the crybabies.  What worries me is constant posts like these and the possibility of Blizzard caving in and giving early BGs which will totally kill world pvp.
---
You wrote this whole thesis and didn't address the fact that servers have 5x the players on them than the games was designed around. They need to drop realm pops to 3000 and quintuple the number of realms. I'm tired of everyone having to be on top of each other fighting for 5x scarcer resources and forcing all pvp to be zergs.
---
Who said that?
---
Had exactly the same problem last night only it was alliance doing the banking. 2 minute respawns just trying to get back to the fps is no fun.
---
Only problem with that is the rep gear from AV.
---
Still, 2 parts of the scepter quest requires to do the same raid twice, so min 1 week.
---
I’m getting farmed to hell on Thunderfury as Horde, it happens sometimes
---
No, there were groups of between 30 and 60 people of each faction fighting in different areas. 
---
At one point the fight moved to thorium point, where a large group of alliance held the town and we pushed up through the choke. It was kinda like a mini arathi basin, with all the blizzards and frost traps on the melee.
---
Yep I thought that for forever
---
in vanilla they had spy like addons that were even more powerful, thankfully we didn't have reddit so it wasn't so widespread but people used them. 
---
Each and every post about Spy just gets more people to download it btw
---
yeah.. people are being just a little dramatic.
---
Seriously the fuking guilt cuz of this damn picture!!!
---
For both I would argue argue hunter. Their pets tank for them and they get asepct of the Cheet (+30% movement speed) way way before they get a mount - siginificantly increasing speed. The current world record for fastest speedrun to max level is by a hunter.
---
Warlock 2nd. Their voidwalkers tank too - but they do not have aspect of the cheetah and run normal speed until they get their lvl 40 mount.
---
You're right. Each server has a bit of faction imbalance and one side will eventually get tired of getting owned.
---
Haha nail on the head
---
Yeah, I had that idea. Level 51 warrior. Might as well do some Princess runs, right? Get the Blackstone Ring, hide out in the dungeon, np. 
---
Alliance camped it all night. Trying to coordinate a corpserun to use my scepter to get everyone in took hours. It wasn't fun, it wasn't worth it, and people were burnt out by the time we even started the dungeon. 
---
"Just hide out in dungeons" is harder than people seem to think it is for people in their 50s. The 50's dungeons are camped by 60s looking for cheap honor.
---
The hilarious, yet sad, part of this all is that the same people who spammed about "no changes" are now instead spamming "reroll to a PvE server" when Blizz caused demonstrable harm to the game by implementing non-vanilla changes. 
---
Goes to show that many players just repeat whatever the hot button phrase of the moment is, without understanding what they're saying. Anyone who was "no changes" should be able to recognize Blizzard's error here. In reality, most of you were only parroting the phrase, just like you're now parroting "reroll to a PvE server."
---
It's disappointing. I really believed most of you when you threatened to quit if Blizz didn't go full #nochanges. Turns out most of you didn't give a fuck.
---
how do you guys know there’s a buff incoming ? Noob here.
---
Me either, but I also don't decide to play a game knowing exactly the risks then bitch about it when those risks play out
---
People who thought that would help are morons. Horde were never going to leave their hugboxes.
---
Obviously. I just mean, adding ABV is unnecessary. It is already implied that it is by volume and nothing else since that IS the measure used as standard. Why even bother specifying that it is volume and not weight when 'weight-percentage' is never used (or at least shouldn't).
---
It makes me feel old because I just don't remember people being such a bunch of little crybaby bitches in vanilla.  Are kids really so soft today?
---
As a healer I've discovered sitting to drink is the 'go pull' signal apparently.
---
I’m not even bothering leveling an alt because what’s the point? Level until the upper 40’s just to get farmed again and reroll again? No thanks
---
To be fair for us EU crowd dire maul came out on time as the base game came out later than NA for us
---
Lmao hey bud whenever you can have a discussion without suddenly trying to shift the focus elsewhere let me know.
---
Same with faerlina alliance.
---
The whole nochanges argument doesn't really work when you already have a frankenpatch that didn't exist. Nobody started molten core with 1.12 talents and warriors were terrible this early. Looking at current dps logs warriors are doing around 2-2.5x the dps of the next highest outside of rogues. With all that in mind there's no reason they couldn't release bgs early.
---
KeK
---
To be fair alot of wow classic players didnt play classic wow and had no one of actually having foresight to this detail.
---
Ok good to know. Basically I want to level a class to 60 asap to get to end game and all that, and also level a class the lazy way without paying much attention and looking at the second monitor while playing in a more relaxed way. But if hunter fits both criteria then great.
---
Ah, ok. So you are saying that you have a similar bad experience. 
---
Sucks that so many people think that’s fun to do
---
Don't you dare talk to warlocks about life tapping as a healer.
---
Lvling my 3rd character on Flamegor now and it's pretty decent, easy to find party or avoid highlvls
---
But in terms of faction balance it seems like there's more horde somewhat like 60/40 or even 65/35 (I'm playing alliance,could be wrong and maybe horde players feel the same, but other way around)
---
Then don't do it.  Focus on pve, change to a pve server, or play a different game.  Or you can ruin a game for millions of other players because you're not being pampered.
---
Didn't Shroud stream for years before blowing up?
---
This is an addon from 2008 during WOTLK, it also uses COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED event to log activity. The earliest occurance of the COMBAT\_LOG event was mentioned in patch 2.4:  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Combat\_Log](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Combat_Log). So no, this is not a credible source wether it existed in vanilla
---
There's nothing you can do to make a macro like that, sorry!
---
Yeah but honestly I don’t really mind I grind enough gold and it’s rare I don’t get tipped for portals.
---
Same. We need battlegrounds since BLIZZARD decided 6 servers (?) was enough initially AND expected people to switch or change realms ? They shot them selves in the good guys and they need to release at least one BG earlier. The grind of that rep is a pain of its own. Unless they merge a server or two it’s gonna get worse IMO
---
dont worry i quit retail too. they do a gear reset every patch with a month of time where the best gear you can achieve is given out to everyone for free. no thanks. im not a hardcore player but i think an mmo should have some level of achievement and persistence.
---
Lmao do you hear yourself? Do some self reflection or go outside man
---
the death of an mmo results not from players who quit, but from players who level up
---
So does that mean people shouldn't roll on loot unless they plan on playing forever?
---
*citation needed
---
So then how does this even affect you?  Just don't tag and go about your life instead of ruining the game for millions of other players because you aren't being pampered.
---
I really wish hub areas in the game had absurd amounts of guards with quick respawns. Atleast this would stop important areas just being camped on by zergs.
---
Hey the few edits that were there I laughed at, but at least for me I was expecting more of them after the last "World record mc" video that was posted.
---
yea it's super difficult to put together your own BRD group
---
Sorry that you're a shitwad
---
Almost everyone I play with thought honor without bgs was a bad idea.  The release has only enforced that ideal in all of us.
---
«You think you do, but you don’t» has never been more true
---
I wasn't the one crying for a change..
---
Don't know what you are reading but I don't think it's the same thing I am
---
If you want the extra hotkey, go for it. I just press my mouse side button and T at the same time and it's literally the same thing and just T by itself is Hamstring. Less buttons is always better in my book!
---
You do realize we sat in bg queues in vanilla right?
---
Which realm? When? I did some censuses with two accounts in the previous days on full realms only and none of them had above 6k. I even counted Morgraine just when the queue started, so assumed that the realm was at max capacity. It was never above 8500 in the recent month.
---
Did you delete your previous results? Because the previous results may show offline members. (Who were online like last time you checked)
---
I would actually be really suprised if Blizzard didn't drop phase 3 just before christmas (maybe with BG's even earlier).
---
I feel it's realistic to say that phase 1 is going to be one of the longest (don't know if this is actually confirmed by Blizzard) and I personally think phase 2 is going to be one of the shortest simply because it doesn't bring any real endgame pve content. A 6 week long phase 2 doesn't feel far fetched to me, with it being clear that Blizzard wont release content on both retail and classic at the same time. I think Blizzard is going to release 8.3 in january and that leaves no classic releases for January and February. Waiting til March with BWL seems highly unlikely if Blizzard wants classic done before the new expansion release (and keep people subbed to classic).  
---
Just my predictions, I don't think phases are going to last as long as people think.
---
You managed to find a small area of a single zone empty long enough to take a screen shot = “Teh phase 2 warglebargle!!”
---
Try opening your eyes.
---
Isn't the overall faction balance across all servers pretty even? Within less than 10% difference?
---
Doesnt work as I have to click it multiple times and my character lays trap after standing up = huge deay usless in pvp.....
---
It means that more causals would me 60 by the time phase 2 hit just like in vanilla. As it is alot of casuals just happen to be in the 48-59 range aka the get farmed range.
---
Pickpockets.
---
&gt; In Hillsbrad XvX with strangers there's a bit of an art to reading the ebb and flow of the mob.
---
this is such bullshit dude lmao, im a 51 warr and i almost never die in those zergfests because the level of nuance to these things is literally braindead, if you are melee just stay on mount untill you see your group pushing the other side back, and charge the few people on the other side that were dumb enough not to be on their mount already after theyve pushed to your town. get on mount after said target dies in half of a second, and rinse and repeat. the only way you should be dying in these shitfests is if you actively force yourself into the other team while they are pushing your side, or if you dont understand that your team is moving back yet and you decide to charge in anyways. the level of nuance in these XvX battles in hillsbrad are literally "stay away from large groups of enemies when they are moving forward, andmove forward when your side is moving forward. that isnt a fucking art reading the ebb and flow, its called looking at 100 players walking back and forth and follow the herd.
---
That guy just said he was with four other people. He’s not camping, ok, but he hadn’t defined “low” or “lame” at all.
---
If that’s 5 60s killing individual 50s, it perfectly matches his description and is bullshit. He doesn’t see it as bullshit because he’s killing people easily, not being easily killed.
---
He’s not talking about fighting other groups of 5 people
---
I play Alliance on an the only US RP server. No issues here.
---
gross
---
Just not true. If the fight ends and the lock has 80% mana and the priest isn't full mana, he should drink. There are many times where locks are losing the group more time for refusing to drink than the healer gains by putting off their drink.
---
*citation needed*
---
I realize what you are implying. My question to you is, would it affect you if we were allowed to move to pve?  If not, why are you worried about it?
---
Oh boy. The QQ is strong isn't it? It's not like we have been warning people who thought STV was bad before.
---
"Just wait for phase 2" 
---
Apparently they didn't think we were telling the truth? 
---
Either way. The salt is still beautiful on this subreddit right now.
---
People cried on the forums, and in general chat but a lot of forum culture was undeveloped so there was a lot less noise
---
I just hit 54 on my druid and have about 250g after buying skills. What should I be spending or saving my gold on at this point? Epic mount or prebis BoEs? Second preBiS gear upgrades that I can buy multiple of? 
---
Any thoughts or advice? I'd really like warden staff for example since I'm HotW/NS hybrid spec, but it's 400-500g on my server. 
---
I feel like either epic mount or prebis BoEs should be my focus but I'm not sure. Either way I'll just keep saving for now.
---
Yup. I was there. Not sure what that has to do with my point. I was never planning to do bgs in classic. If I wanted to sit in a bg queue I’d just log onto retail.
---
Its rough out there Ill say that lol
---
Damn everyone, I’m still on 36 (very excited to reach 40, my sister and I have been farming lots of gold), BGs I feel is already coming too early for me because I’ll need to farm up mats for my twink and then level a character to 19 which actually takes a bit to do
---
I dunno if I'm doing something wrong but I can find anyone running ST
---
Rogues ganking in groups is the most efficient way to farm honor right now. They will continue doing it until BGs come out.
---
Yeah, Bloodfang EU, horde (obviously). Not giving out names because of rule 3, but definitely will remember him
---
Elemental is a pretty well-known PvP build. The primary strength is burst AOE via nova-&gt;blast wave and CoC (which means it works the best in group encounters). Shatter + ignite also enables fire blast to easily take out 1/3 - 1/2 of most casters' HP.
---
No, the Horde massacre innocent farmers and villagers in hillsbrad. They even poisoned the farmers puppy.
---
crit cap really doesn't matter for warriors. its only for white hits and most of the dmg will be from yellows, especially fully wbuffed like this.
---
feral is also high tempo dps, you won't have your abilities not hit the mob cause he died before travel time/cast time.
---
you can also do the regular FF before going to dps the mob, so not sure what the issue was of playing moonkin instead of feral but kudos to making it work
---
Guys, I just speed ran Candyland, you know the board game? I have spent the last 15 years perfecting it and getting ready for my 15 minutes of spotlight so I could trash talk other NEETs in the Candyland speedrunning community.
---
Just wait for the Bloodvine Set. As gear gets better, so do Warlocks. Can't argue with PvP though.
---
Very true why would I bring a lvl 52 when I can bring a 60?
---
crit cap is a meme, it doesn't matter. if you could have 100% crit you should aim for that. crit cap only affects white attacks and your dmg will be mostly yellow as a warrior.
---
Spy isn’t that bad for Druid or Rogue if you use it. If you get in range of someone you can run out of range to stealth and it won’t pick it up. As long as you don’t use any abilities like sprint once you get back into range you can catch people using it off guard. People have become so dependent on it that they seem to panic even more if you actually catch them.
---
With that said, the addon is annoying as hell because it beeps every time a horde flies over you and never stops in neutral cities. It feels cheap and has helped me survive in situations I probably should not have. I would prefer its removal but unfortunately anything to break spy would also break damage and threat meters and any other addon that relies on reading the combat log. Therefore, I refuse to play at a disadvantage to the horde using it.
---
In RBGs you have several arena like fights happening simultaneously.
---
You all are a bunch of whiners.
---
White bandit mask shuffle has been making me pretty good coin.
---
Just wish it didnt take forever to craft and DE en akk lol.
---
Gratz tho!
---
BGs like AV? Sorry to say but they're exactly the same if the retro AV event is anything to go by.
---
He did that because you're flat wrong. Blizzard would absolutely not release a WOTLK feature in Classic before implementing BGs early.
---
In a few months battlegrounds will be out and world population won't matter anymore.
---
That's what it's like at every level for alliance on those servers, though. People take it out on lower level horde in frustration. The farthest north I can travel safely is Dun Morogh.
---
Years ahead of his time
---
well it's a dps loss for the person that FF, I guess he's right in that sense xd
---
Don't be scared to pick Troll Priest either, Shadowguard with the Blackout talent can be seriously awesome. Especially in PvP.
---
Well this was probably a placeholder because they stopped working on it before transports were working.
---
Transports were only added in beta I think
---
Cause a 60 doesn’t wanna run it
---
I think you meant, ZugZug
---
Some people love making others mad, just like you are now
---
isnt herod like 80% alliance populated?
---
So what is the unique situation? It seems to me you just want something cheap and mobile.
---
Judgement is dead though and that’s where mograine transferred to. Really annoying.
---
Are you ok mate? PM me if you want to have a chat
---
Then level faster noobie, you had 3 months.
---
There is no excuse.
---
Bgs wont do anything. They will queue for it and keep camping fps.
---
Hypnotoad???
---
I see a lot of posts going "don't speed things up, phases are coming too fast!" or similar, but I don't think that really applies. This post is only talking about adding 1 or 2 BGs early, not all of Phase 3. 
---
We could delay Phase 3 to March easily. There is zero reason to add BWL soon. But with (at least) one BG in, the game would be in a really good state. You would have the honor farmers mass-farming BGs, you have people who are still levelling able to do so in the open world and you still have world PvP through raids/random world encounters. It would be a massive improvement.
---
There are servers that are hurting a lot due to faction imbalance which is starting to lead to people simply not playing if they can't use the open world. Those people may not come back.
---
Pvp servers are a gankfest. This idea that you can choose when to pvp is a joke.  Pvp servers are for players who want to pvp.  
---
Its unfortunate that players rolled on a pvp server who didn't fully understand what it means to be always flagged for pvp.  However changing how world pvp is handled is not fair for the players who rolled on a pvp server to pvp.
---
When a faction takes over an area, the other faction needs to respond with more numbers thus creating a wpvp event...surprise that is the point of these servers.  
---
If you want to level onto a pve server.
---
I'd love to be on a balanced server but blizzard didn't do faction only transfers the first time and alliance organized a mass exodus.
---
Epic mount always wins this battle as it will improve most quality of life issues you may have. Most of your pre-bis will come from dungeons that you have plenty of time to run.
---
Yup. There are fucking piles of skeletons in BRM all the time.
---
They called me a fool for rolling PvE  
---
I feel justified :D
---
But they can keep/add more layers to remove queues, but they don’t, so clearly that’s not consistent. People are not wanting to play where every flight path is camped, towns are surrounded, it’s just not how the game ever was nor was intended to be.
---
&gt; and there are too many idiots killing civilian NPCs netting you Dishonorable Kills. 
---
Newsflash: DHKs lower your **rank rating** immediately. If you have no rank, DHKs **DO NOT MATTER**. Ergo DHKs **DO NOT MATTER** in the first week.
---
but you can
---
I'll go ahead and take the streamer fanboi downvotes and say that this wasn't as impressive as it looks. 3 combat rogues (worst pvp spec) with no pvp trinket vs a frost pvp specced engineer mage.
---
Doesn't take much for the mage to come out on top of that one. He didn't even need ice block or cold snap...
---
You thought you wanted to roll on a PvP server, but you didn't.
---
People didnt "bitch" about the risks last week did they? There is a risk in skydiving, but its suicide to jump without a parachute. There is a risk in playing on a PvP server, but you have entire zones being unplayable.
---
One thing MoP Challenge mode teached me is running ahead of group a bit and drop soft spot to the ground starting drinking as soon as combat drops. Really good skill in Classic.
---
I'm a warlock and I think it's bad. It should only track people who use the addon.
---
I wouldn't call it obliviousness, the overall gaming enviornment/community has definitely changed these past 15 years and for sure, theres no way they are going to make EVERYONE happy. 
---
But they damn sure would have made many more happy if they handled the server quality better and just generally managed things smoother from the start.
---
We all know now how much better things could be because we have been playing it for so long, but back in vanilla I dont think as many people were unhappy. I think they just played and enjoyed the game.
---
WE NEED CLASSIC+
---
Too late for that. #nochanges and all..
---
Too many reddit/twitch vultures just want to see people punished
---
 They dont really care about the morals or ethics.
---
"I agree with your message but I will wait for someone else to take action"
---
-Literally everyone
---
This will be gone in a week or two and after that BGS will fully kill it. All of you are so far at to fucking whine and whine at length about nothing.
---
Mage in full bis with full enchants, professions, and infinite of every consumable he could need playing against people with 8 years less experience. How did he win!
---
Yesterday I saw someone in this sub describe it very accurately: this is not WPvP, this is a riot influenced by mob mentality. Half of these actions don't even give honor or nets very little honor when a single kill is spreaded out among 10 players. They are just doing it to cause maximum chaos.
---
I'm still hoping by reset day a majority of these rioters will find out how grindy it is to rank up via WPvP and just give up until BGs come out.
---
[hello looking for frens](https://i.imgur.com/VgTKZGh.jpg)
---
The intent of the system was to be super punitive.
---
It’s made to prevent people from killing questgivers and other important NPCs that are crucial to basic gameplay for the other faction.
---
Without some *serious* teeth on the system, it’d be ignored.
---
Kromkrush is almost 45% alliance according to Warcraftlogs. (42.5% past 2 weeks), meaning 42.5% of anyone who cleared a raid and logged it the past 2 weeks are alliance. Unless you're looking to join a realm with 70% alliance your experience is going to be more or less the same.
---
I'm not the person complaining, just pointing out the mental deficiencies behind a lot of people playing open world PvP games. Keep going though, maybe use the word carebear or safe-space to really get your point across. That's why you came here on your alt account right?
---
lmao why? they released DM early, why is it an impossibility??
---
Haha this is one of the best things I've seen from classic so far.
---
You all wanted WPVP and now everyone's complaining how it's boring and not like it was 15 yrs ago when it was new.  There are a lot of things people are referring to in Vanilla through their Rose Color Glasses.
---
The expectations and then demands for more because you're getting bored is kind of silly when there is plenty to do already.  "Ahhhh but I've done everything already!" Ha
---
reminds me of the kitchen where i work. we have a staff of 6 people, and we have like 8 veggie peelers. as if there will be a situation where all 6 of us have to suddenly drop everything were doing and peel carrots simultaneously.
---
This is a great idea. They should start queuing at 60/40 active players or somewhere in there. 3000 horde and 2000 alliance online? Horde gets queued until more alliance come online or horde log off
---
I kind of like this idea if only because f horde
---
Ha. You think roaming horde players arnt going to grief low levels? Ha
---
When you take their candles.. They're stuck inside the cave.. Darkness. They'll never get out. They'll never get out!
---
It is "the best", but that doesn't mean it's the best for you personally. The idea of unwanted/spontaneous combat is an integral aspect of WoW and is a big chunk of what makes the game so exhilarating and immersive. It still can be those things without pvp, but it is not the same. Nowadays sure you could argue that the sheer knowledge of the game in 2019 makes that fact more abusable than in the past, and a different perspective on how our time is spent in 2019 than in 2004 plays a big role. But it's undeniable that it is what makes WoW what it is. You don't need to feel ashamed for not enjoying that aspect.
---
You're not the only one, but the opinion is uneducated, or just lacking. Alliance side Skeram right now is about to die because of p2. You can't get from TP to BRD without 10+ deaths, our lock died 20 times yesterday on the run as a geared 60.  
---
I just now landed in LHC on my way to turn in 3 scales and run an UD. I was killed twice in LHC before I could turn in 1 scale (15+ horde just camping FP). Had a 2min rez timer before I turned in all 3.  
---
I am now stealth walking from LHC to Strat because that is the fastest way.  
---
They \*\*must\*\* be able to see subs will cancel and revenue will drop because of this. For all of the issues on balanced PvP servers right now, consider the unbalanced ones...
---
Agreed. Gear is temporary, mounts are forever.
---
This is why I'm glad I'm on a balanced and medium population server. Having a great time.
---
oh no bamboozled, anyway after some searches they actually can't do that. They just try the most used passwords on a large number of accounts or get a hand on company database
---
Try on your own server subreddit. Server discord. And even the wow classic discord has a guild alliance recruitment I believe.
---
That's just raiders though. That doesn't count the Horde that are 60 and not raiding, which outnumber the Alliance which are 60 and not raiding.
---
Care Bear for life!
---
Imagine how glorious it would be... no damage/threat meters, no spies, no omnibars/cd reminders etc. One might say, the skill ceiling would be through the roof.
---
Rogues who do BRD pickpocket farming, do you kill any bosses on your runs?
---
nice one dude
---
Not at this stage of the game. Weaponskill would be nowhere near as strong if there was little white dmg.
---
We’re frozen in time at the exact moment these anvils were due to be shipped to Teldrassil and the gnome engineer.
---
The problem with this arguement of "causing discomfortis never okay" is that, when you go down that path, you end up with my proof of people getting offended at things that are not offensive. GG EZ became such a "problem" that even Blizzard had to step in and the consequences of that is you then make it seem as if the 'community' of Overwatch is 'toxic'. Well yes if something as non-offensive as gg ez is considered to be toxic behavior then youve set the bar extremely low.  
---
The reason that causing discomfort *is* okay is because thats how you grow as a person. You become stronger mentally since you dont have to "stop and take a break from the internet" because someone typed 4 letters. You quickly learn that the only way you let things bother you, is to *let* them bother you.  
---
I mean, its pretty obvious why discomfort upon a person is a thing that is necessary. Its challenge. If you are never challenged you never overcome anything and instead are left weak and when someone who has been challenged comes around, theyll be able to overtake you with ease.
---
I mean, technically Roundabout was popularized when it rode the charts for months in 1972 and was subsequently played on every rock radio station several times a day for the last 47 years, but Jojo's certainly introduced it to a totally different audience :)
---
Literally you take 15% fewer hits.  That's 1/6 hits that would have hit you now don't.
---
Why don't you make Aliiance lvl 60 and see it for yourself, green boy?
---
Reading through most of these posts I can say that my Experience is just like so remembered it. 
---
Maybe I am just lucky but on Patchwork(GER) it seems pretty balanced maybe slightly favouring horde. All in all I level without 10 hordes ganking my flightpoint. Just some casual fighting between peers. It’s really enjoyable.
---
The honor system killed world PVP in vanilla, and it has in classic, too. I hate the honor system.
---
probably a timeline change
---
Its because they listened to #nochanges that we re where we are.
---
For leveling a warrior (fury if it matters any): is it worth to use demoralizing shout when fighting enemies 1v1?
---
Bg’s came out 6 weeks after PvP in Vanilla so...
---
That's what a lot of people are going to do. Why would you expect them to roll alliance and be at a disadvantage again?
---
insect swarm is worth a debuff slot if you're going to bring a moony.  
---
" but most of those are irrelevant in the context of a raid where your  role is just to do as much damage as possible on a single target. "
---
you mean like those fights where the top DPS can't dps because they have to spend the whole fight decursing?  
---
min/maxer arguments are usually bunk compared to the actuality of the raid
---
&gt;the other faction needs to respond with more numbers 
---
yes.. very easy when faction balance is 80% horde on my server lmao
---
if you cant hang just go to pve
---
I really hope they add it. I play on Ashkandi-Horde and I work afternoons 3-11pm EST and all the guilds on my server raid in the evening so I cannot make the raids. As much as I love my guild I just can't quit my job to raid with them. I have a family to feed ect..
---
Ashbringer, but no where is "not a total gankfest"
---
thats true...just sucks
---
oh you right ! I've been trying MS but it's hard to use all of the stacks with only this spell

I get what you're going for her but it's hard not to read this as, "we make other people miserable to have fun."
---
You're directly part of the problem with this kind of behavior.
---
I think they should release Arathi Basin early, at the very least.
---
I got son of a bitch and it’s all I need :D
---
i get it, i’m a 53 warrior on Kirtonos alliance. All I’m saying is that it’s always been like that. In vanilla people complained that the pvp ranks only catered to those who spent the most time playing and that it wasn’t skill based at all. Arena’s were a direct result of that complaining.
---
BG’s will alleviate some of the honor farming, but the deck will always be stacked against the numerically inferior faction on a pvp server.
---
Can I ask how you know they changed the spawn timer?
---
Pickpockets would be the act of pickpocket. The actual person doing it would be pickpocketeer(s), compare to smithereen(s).
---
not sure why you would just not log out to prevent this
---
It's much worse right now than it was in vanilla. It sucked then, it really sucks now.
---
You don't get a TUFT from hillsbrad.
---
Hey I talked with blizz support. They said characters have been getting stuck. They reversed my transfer and said try again. So I'm on round 2. I'll let you know if it works later!
---
1. They fucked up those Horde only transfers and separated groups of friends and guilds
---
2. They initially offered *FAR* too few servers, and had to offer transfers to entice people to leave the servers they launched the game with - this last minute effort also failed miserably
---
You can be a bootlicker all your life, but dont expect the rest of the world to stick their ass in the air whenever Papa Blizzard comes around
---
Fairbanks alliance is having the same problem.
---
I see your pain, and would like to add that it's far worse for a lvl 48.   :)  Just gonna play Overwatch for a few weeks, see if they add BGs.  If not, I'll cancel my sub and call it a fun flashback.
---
Possible that's also correct, but someone who pickpockets is also pickpocket (noun). Multiple people who pickpocket are pickpockets. 
---
https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/pickpocket#Noun
---
You can wait 4 and a half minutes after being logged out and the char will teleport back to the entrance of the dung
---
Reeee. This is exactly what you signed up for lmao.
---
Forget BGs, give us BWL!!
---
All the fast leveling classes level pretty quick so I would lean towards just picking what you actually want to play out of Mage,Warlock,Druid,and Hunter than purely picking one out of leveling speed.
---
Because we expected them to be around the same population as vanilla.
---
Character Stats Classic
---
All that being said, if you're a halfway decent rogue, it's a blast. Picking off stragglers, other rogues, healers, etc while avoiding the zergs is a ton of fun.
---
If youre drinking as a lock after every pull youre literally doing it wrong.
---
No, lmao.
---
Literally just now learning about it in this thread. Now that I know what it is I realize how all the horde was able to keep finding me so easy the past few days. Yeah this add-on needs to be removed.
---
?????????
---
weapon skill makes so you need 6 hit instead of 9 to cap your yellows, which makes so you can replace shit like brigam girdle for omokk, trading 1% hit for 1% crit. the more crit you can get the better, at any stage + the 20% glancing reduction. its not about white dmg being little just about crit cap being not important.
---
again, most of the dmgs are yellows and you have heroic strike feature in play as well.
---
you can also easily check that on warcraft logs
---
[here is one of the top warriors in the world](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Q8aPjf3kAyG1xR42#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=23)
---
like i said, only 30% from white attacks.
---
Go to the southeast coast in hillsbrad, swim along coast to wetlands. Much easier than going through arathi at this level. For the 20 quest.
---
This is why the classic pvp system is so trash. In all other ranked systems the focus is on pitting players against those of equal skill. No one enjoys the process of good players rolling over bad players for 16hrs a day. 
---
nochanges aside, I would really prefer them implementing RBGs, or at least implementing MMR into normal BGs and just straight scrapping this horribly incentivized pvp system. The only fun my group will have after 2 days of pubstomping will be when we run into other premades, and we are actually punished by the system for staying in those matches so I doubt they will happen frequently.
---
Mother of God is mine the only comment you read?  Look through literally any post on the matter and you'll see plenty of Horde mouthbreathers parroting it.
---
obviously
---
Those stats are wrong btw, they've been wildly inaccurate since launch and only got worse when they broke the addon that was farming those stats.
---
I don't like facerolling either, but your shit "solution" is to make Horde mass quit. You're calling me the child? All you're thinking about is "me me me" without even considering that the idea of faction queues is shit. Hope you get farmed and quit since you want to ruin my game.
---
I did not know, thanks good sir!
---
They give me anxiety.
---
nope
---
Because for those who actually played vanilla it's a sequence, not just the final patch iteration.
---
World PvP was at the core of vanilla. Battlegrounds too.
---
But capital city battlemasters and cross-realm battlegrounds only came towards the very end of it, and is reminiscent of the multi-server sharding system, incognito community, instant access teleporting to instanced content and zero consequence gameplay of retail. Hence, "retail-esque".

"career is over"

&gt;proceeds to make a post about him on Reddit
---
they will NEVER be adding LFG into the game, they said as much, it goes against the philosophy of classic. so how is that not an impossibility?
---
It is as lolol42 said. Obviously we knew it was coming at some point, but knowing when would allow us to pace our leveling accordingly
---
You sound mad that your shitter guild takes 5 hours on 2 different nights to clear it.
---
What? You can always find groups for Mara because that fucking ring never drops off Princess, and it’s BIS for a lot of people. You could also run Sunken Temple. People are being way too dramatic about all of this. You really can’t Quest but that doesn’t mean you have zero options for playing the game.
---
Yeah ok buddy. Surely you’ll find someone parroting you’re straw man. Good luck
---
I like how all the rage quitting Alliance can only just insult Horde because you're upset and emotional. Come up with a different idea than "make the Horde quit so they stop killing me". Fuck off out of the game you self centered cunt. Making a majority Horde quit because you picked a crappy faction, that isn't my fault, why do you want to punish me for it? See why I have no problem wanting you to rage quit? 
---
I really don't care if all Alliance quit especially when they're douchenozzles like you. Oh no my PvP server is now a PvE server! Who cares? I like PvE more anyways. The longevity of the game won't mean shit to me when you force me to quit because I literally cannot play unlike you just getting your shit kicked in a lot.
---
How bout no
---
That's because there are many many more players on a single realm compared to Vanilla and Blizzard has stated this many times. So of course you'll have more people contesting in hot spots.
---
Theres a guy on Firemaw aswell! He is doing it for free though! I allways leave a good tip:)
---
wrong, I'm not mad.  I DO want to transfer tho. This is not vanilla pvp i expected, It was fine before this phase in my opinion.  I am fine with people liking it in this state.  I would think that you would be fine with people not liking it.  Now the question remains, since this is not vanilla-like due to population levels, can we just go to casual care-bear land without losing 3 months of play time?
---
I'm fine admitting I didn't expect this. My memory is much different than reality. I was wrong.  Now, why is there hesitation and argument from the PVP community to let us go?
---
People who play paladins usually reroll to warriors after about 20 levels or so
---
CT Raid emergency monitor was disabled permanently prior to AQ. However in its place was a healing addon that basically auto selected who to heal. We had a paladin go from a meh healer to smashing the charts. Turns out it was addon doing work and he was watching tv most of the time.
---
Last night I grouped in Hillsbrad for world pvp and it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had playing WoW.
---
I played it for like 3 hours yesterday.  The game is totally playable.
---
You rolled on a pvp server. Why would expect people from the opposite faction not to attack you?
---
I don't really think it's 100% a faction imbalance problem. It certainly hurts things but even if the server is 80/20 split, there's enough in that 20% to make the lives of some lower level players miserable.   
---
I think it's more an issue of a poor split AND the players having no focussed ways to gain honour. So the only option is world PvP, and with a faction imbalance it's just going to be fairly miserable for those in the minority.
---
I'm not sure if you're kidding about remembering them, but it's Jokerd from the guild Power if anyone got curious. The guy who got to world first level 60 on Classic and his Twitch blew up in the short-term, partly to this subreddit.
---
Tried reloading the UI and re-logging into the game.  Waiting for the GM to respond would've taken a long time. I went off by finding the position of the item I wanted via wowhead but ended up with the incorrect item
---
i promise that you don't.
---
Ive been on a pvp server for 15 years bud. That isnt the point. You parrots never seem to understand that a lot of people roll pvp servers with the unrealistic fantasy that there will be fair pvp. Its only unrealistic because dipshit ganklords want to spawn camp flight masters and low level questhubs to get their daily dose of pixelated validation. 
---
The point of my post is that said douchelords will literally kill the game and watch their own classic fantasy dwindle away because of dead servers as a result. Dont believe me? Because its already happening.
---
This. Blizzard shit the bed Day one with limited number of servers.
---
Oh, I did that kind of sleepy. I threw it in so you could sneak into raids and not fuck with debuff limit, but if you're not raiding just drop it into dodge
---
No its not. The 60 doesnt stand a chance because you just get cc'd to death and if theres a healer, any damage you do will be easily nullified. The gear disparity is simply not that big to make up for how many people are on you. Like if theres 1 rogue full duration stunning you, youre dead.
---
1. we weren't outnumbered, the server is just bad. server imbalance in the 10s of thousands doesn't matter when Atiesh has a problem putting more than 20-30 on either side in TM/SS most times.
---
2. they were farming you in there most of the time.. i enjoyed standing around unflagged watching
---
3. sit around in the middle of alliance during the fights and watch how often the offspec hybrids heal and how everyone (mages too) cleanses everyone else. Horde doesn't do this at all.. this is why you get pushed back into TM so often.
---
People aren't gonna hit Rank14 this way. They'll figure it out and give up on that dream b
---
White damage p1 is only so people conserve mana for p2 burn.. literally no point in telling warriors/rogues/warlocks to not dps in p1... this isnt 2004 anymore..
---
I just wish I could pvp for exp and get to 60 that way rather dungeon grind
---
&gt;I'd also argue it's hardly medicine at all.
---
Because your MD / DO degree is from... where, exactly?
---
Boom Roasted.
---
to be fair I do believe a repair guy shows up during the naxx patch, but I could be wrong. until then it's best to just always repair before leaving UC.

---
Ive been thinking of this, trying to make sure i dont lose out too much in PVE. Do you ever have reason to use SS?
---
Actually had some decent pvp in the plaguelands on skeram last night. Running with guildies in a group of 10 we found at least 3 separate groups of alliance from 5-20 in size and had a few decent skirmishes.
---
But... the imbalance would always rear its ugly head. All it took was 1 bystander to announce our fight in general chat and in under a minute we'd be swarmed by other horde stealing our kills and reducing our honor.
---
This is exactly what I kept telling everyone about this "bug".  If you Vanish while continuing to run around, they're still running their stealth checks every tick and have a much higher chance of redetecting you.  That's how it's always been.
---
It's no different than when you stealth up to something in the first place.  If you stand still, your chance of being detected if much lower than while you continue to move.
---
How the fuck do rogues who have played the game so long not know this?
---
Man, yall dont like being called out, do you?
---
Thanks! Using an alt only takes ~2 minutes though!
---
How many times and how many ways can we all say ROLL PVE FOR CHRIST SAKE.
---
We need faction login queues.
---
Definitely, I'd love that. If you go onto the "reconnect with your vanilla server" official forums now, one of the main things that people recognize one another from is from hanging out there, dueling, fighting hordies while at the battleground entrances, recognizing good players and building a community. With everyone and their dog queueing up from the capitals that died off, and cross-realm bgs was the final nail in the chest towards having about as much of a community feel as...Call of Duty or some shit.
---
Imp SS is just so you can not fuck with debuff limit in MC. Probably extra dodge would be better tho
---
Yeah I don't think so. Let's not pretend that that's relevant, nor that you'd change your mind if I had one.
---
Have a nice evening.
---
I mained an arms warrior dude lol. Of course healers make it better, but you don’t need them to be good.
---
I'm trying to set itemrack to change my main hand to a dagger when I stealth and back to my sword when I'm out of stealth. I can manually change weaps with the click of a button, but the events (going into and out of stealth) specifically aren't working, so I can't automate it.
---
If you've got a setup like I'm looking for, I'd appreciate knowing how you did it. Thanks!
---
&gt;just think it’s hilarious.
---
Why is it hilarious that a group of individuals with free mind that post in a community have a different opinion than another group of individuals that are part of the same community?
---
Horde, warlock, no dungeon leveling as in grinding over and over. I did ST for the first time, completing all quests, and BRD for the first time completing as much as you can the first time. I did all the quests in Un’Goro, Azshara and Felwood. Working on Winterspring now. Most of the zone questing has been solo.
---
Even says in the tooltip of mindblast that it causes high threat or something, definitely not a normal dps spell.
---
On every server?
---
dodging the accusation
---
ok richy boomer
---
Best players in regards to what? "Best" players is so subjective.
---
Lolno
---
The number of posts complaining about imbalance and gank squads is honestly getting out of hand. Maybe the man was right about the 'you think you do' thing in the end?
---
You described Fairbanks exactly. Which other servers are like this too?
---
&gt;Poeple don't know what they actually want.
---
This is not a hivemind.
---
Yeah but what do you do for the next 29 minutes and 40 seconds?
---
Leeway mechanic makes this meme old. Backpeddle is also necessary for navigating down steep terrain to catch edges or making small precise jumps. If you don't have it bound to something in classic you're missing out.
---
Nah, they have no idea where you cast stealth.
---
If you knew it sucked then, and still chose to play on a PvP server KNOWING full well world PvP phase was coming (and you absolutely did) - then you have literally no room to complain.  You actively chose this.
---
The most noteworthy thing about the Warcraft movie is that they faithfully recreated the chunky aesthetics of Warcraft in live-action and stuck closely to the world, but it's not a great movie. IMO it's mostly worth watching if you just want to see what live-action Warcraft would look like.
---
Still waiting to hear why bc isn't strictly better than vanilla.
---
The big sticking point everyone seems to have is flying mounts killing world pvp. From what I'm seeing lately that sounds like an act of mercy to me.
---
Yea but if you don't want to trouble anyone that is another option
---
I play alliance which is outnumber by Horde by over half. It’s about 2/3 Horde. And yeah, I fucking love it too.
---
As heal I had the luxury to get in sooner. I did my first imp run with 51. got most of my BiS items with 51-53 and don’t even want to go there anymore because the exp in brd is horrible compared to what you get in lbrs, for example. The first half of lbrs and second half of brd is about the same level, but lbrs gives you so much more exp.
---
Shhhh don't tell them about feralas. Let them stay in Hillsbrad.
---
Nice try dude. I don’t think any faction is really having any fun with P2. Ally are getting relentlessly camped and horde are having to spend hours roaming around finding people to kill while having to compete with other horde. The ideal solution would be better faction balance, but that’ll never happen. BGs would solve the problem almost immediately
---
I think it clearly was the anvil, i mean it could be the anvil but this would be silly.
---
Mine shows coordinates of where they casted it
---
It really does help to speak on discord, makes that character feel more alive imo.
---
You will 100% not be able too in Classic, when paid transfers arrive.
---
They reduced the amount of NPCs by 50% making  it possible to just rush the general without even capping the towers or kiling the commander.
---
&gt; Let's not pretend that that's relevant
---
Well, it is relevant. If you're speaking about things you're not qualified to speak about, then you need to step back and recognize the limits of YOUR knowledge before making such assertions. 
---
As for my opinions, they are rooted in history and cultural considerations and are doubtless broader than what you'd be comfortable with. It's also  a tad racist to insist that other cultures have to adhere to your definitions of medicine and the like. 
---
You have a good morning.
---
Dk’s do not count this week. We are all rank 0. Dk’s subtract xp in real time.
---
what is gold for?
---
"actuall vanilla pvp" lol the combat log was around still in vanilla, and so was tab targetting.
---
Hiding behinds trees and buildings NEVER worked against decent players.
---
Spy doesn't change anything. I literally don't even notice it as a rogue.
---
Level 42 horde and I can't quest anywhere on Incendius
---
I look forward to the other pre-mades, those are the best fights.
---
bUrself
---
nah, yall just bad
---
World pvp is so boring. Giant raids poking at each other for hours, I've gotten zero satisfaction from it . Smaller battles will be much more fun when you can actually tell what's going on. Imo
---
Its unrealistic to ask players to reroll now just because that was the norm back then. Its different this time. People have invested many times more effort into their characters over this short period of time compared to back then. 
---
Now i have 2 60s, tons of rare and expensive recipes and several thousand gold. Back then in the same amount of time i was a lvl 36 warrior with a bunch of alts on random servers.
---
Hide behind the tree!
---
They would probably just lose subscribers if they did that now. That kind of thing would only work at launch I think. An 80% Horde dominant server now can't login until 30% of them go alliance? but they also cant play both factions on the same server so are they gonna delete their mains? Unlikely. I just wish they thought of it earlier.
---
Shazzrah is a shitfest. Just abandoned my lvl 60 pala there.
---
When has fair wpvp ever been a thing lol
---
It's a bit sad for all the people who never played Vanilla and believed the hype of #nochanges people about how great the PvP was back then.
---
WoW Vanilla was always a PvE game where they added a PvP system on top at the last moment. It was sometimes fun but mostly because people had no idea what they were doing and because they tweaked it every patch to avoid catastrophe. In a world of BiS/spy/aoe-rush efficiency, PvP crumbles.
---
Lol. Even though what I said was a figure of speech, you’re wrong - because in BETA they actually did have a group finder for a period of time.
---
But no. They probably won’t be adding bgs early. 
---
Didn’t literally mean “they’ll add dungeon finder” lmaoo
---
My bets on Lyceum in BRD
---
Lol
---
Are people forgetting rogues have Evasion and Improved Sprint.
---
Popping evasion increases your dodge chance by 50% and improved sprint gets you out of movement impairing abilities, like concussive shot. 
---
Evasion is learned around level 8 or something and I  believe the first rank of Improved Sprint from the talent tree can be learned at level 19 or 20.
---
Raid with selfish children and any loot system has issues.
---
I don't believe this for a second. Not to mention the difficulty of even getting to 15%..
---
And them fuck them with roaming enemy death squads everywhere they go.
---
People wanted #nochanges
---
Yuu8ooo
---
Off topic anecdote
---
It’s about as close to balanced as you can get with a PvP server though
---
People complain so much about how the game is made because they are used to game developers bending to the whims of forum communities. It's like a child who cries because their mother always folds.
---
I'm not saying it's easy to level now - it's definitely harder, as every contested zone is now truly contested, but I wish people wouldn't change the game through crying and would instead just play (or don't), and adapt. It is possible if you try your best, I know from experience.
---
There’s 2 level 10 bots camping the wc oasis all day every day I even sold one of them a deviate pattern on the AH I only noticed because I had seen the same bots on alts I’d level in the barrens.  Just wait until you get to desolace there’s a horde quest that bots always farm underwater because there’s a repeatable quest that gives like 50s reward or something, usually hunters with hydrocane
---
Theres tons of rogue bots in Feralas @ Dreadmist EU. No idea why but they run around killing those frayfeather's. Got about 40-50 free loots last week since I'd tag the mob right before the rogue attacked it.
---
&gt;Phases are supposed to follow vanilla release.
---
WSG release before BWL. It should've released in P2 if they wanted to follow Vanilla release.
---
&gt;can't wait a few weeks when it's been 3 days since P2 was launched
---
Not weeks, more like months. P2 took 10 weeks to release.
---
Additionally, serious PvPers have been waiting since launch to actually have a game mode to play. So we've not been waiting 3 days, more like 10 weeks.
---
&gt;cry babies like you
---
Wanting a game mode for a major activity in the game that is to be expected is being a crybaby?
---
Does that add-on show stealthed players?!?!
---
Mount, but there are some edge cases where you dont buy the mount imho.
---
For example I am just raid logging on my main so when I was farming for mount a transmute undeath to water recipe popped on ah and I bought that instead.
---
Well fuck i feel like an asshole now.
---
SS/FD/Trap, Mark, Flare, Aimed/auto/multi sting concuss etc
---
Plenty of small scale wpvp going on throughout the world. 
---
You choose to sit in hillsbrad and participate in the mindless aoe for 1-10 honor per kill.
---
I never hit 60 until after BC hit. And yet wpvp persisted.
---
It hasn’t always been like that. The servers are way more filled than vanilla servers were. You have at least 4-5x the amount of players. So you have 4-5x the amount of gankers. But in reality it’s more like 10-20x the amount because people play the game differently than they did back then.
---
good joke
---
Not if I'm still better without the addon. If i had the addon I would even have to try anymore. Might aswell download a bot and watch a computer kill these plebs.
---
That sounds extremely contrived and very untrue.
---
Mental gymnastics to justify being upset and all that.
---
Weapon skill is maxed in pvp
---
60k exp an hour. Yeah because you reloaded seconds before the first pull and you stopped the second after the last pull. Now add in the time it takes to reset and the 5-10 minutes it takes to get to the first pack and you'll be down to 30k/H
---
and that shovel while ur at it.
---
Also not like Vanilla because back then people didn't have lvl 60s friends. It's so annoying leveling (46 atm) when I gank or counter gank a few levelers around my level and they feel so compelled that they can't fight their own fights so they have to call up level 60s. Seriously, this 5 man ally group was leveling where my group was, we killed them, then they came back with two 60s. It's just pathetic
---
2% dodge = 15% avoidance?
---
Did you go to public school?
---
I wish it was like that for me, even playing at 3 in the morning on Mankrik is just when all the Chinese bots come on so then I have to compete with them...
---
Thanks for showing everyone you have no knowledge on the issue whatsoever
---
They also let alliance transfer off putting our server even more horde bias.
---
It won't matter for rankers, still sucks to be on a server with no world pvp at all though.
---
Looks like he's farming the defias mask
---
Link?
---
Nope, absolutely not. If blizzard had 10 extra servers and changed nothing else, they'd be 10 empty ones. The community will not make even servers on their own.
---
World PVP not exciting? That's what classic was all about!

lmao.

Pvp deaths don't damage your gear
---
There is no way to do that I believe. I think you can set up multiple indicators for the buffs.
---
To me, the problem is obvious. The population is simply too big for the size of the gameworld.
---
West coast also draws the aussies who want to play on a US realm, which is likely a big part of this.
---
I still think the populations are the biggest issue with phase 2. Either 2 things are happening on every server
---
\- Your faction is grossly outnumbered and there is no point in pvping
---
\- You have to join a zerg, even in zones that were great solo pvp spots during the pre bg honor days before
---
This is not what pre bg honor days were like back in the day.
---
that would be great. could you find out what his talent spec is? is he 17/34/0?
---
Another one bites the dust boys!
---
Awesome video, was anyone else expecting a rick roll?
---
Lol how mature
---
Or the ones who don't use it. You just must be another player lacking entire brain to contemplate playing unassisted. What's the matter, can't you use that be enormous brain of yours? Too busy looking for a safe place to color?
---
... literally a server type for those that don’t want pvp...
---
Thanks for the data.
---
I've only seen one Kromcrush census before, and it was nearly 50/50. That was shortly after launch though, before free server transfers.
---
None of my toons are level 60 yet, so I haven't witnessed a huge imbalance in faction populations just yet. I mostly just stick to my grind and pick off the occasional passerby.
---
It would seem that, since the time of the first census I saw, either many more Horde showed up or many Alliance decided to leave. Have you heard of a mass exodus of alliance from Kromcrush? I guess it happens, but I didn't notice it on my end.
---
Joined a pug that later becamr my guild, one week later we clearing it in an hour with random casualplayers lmao
---
My vanilla server was more balanced than any classic server we have is.
---
Wife, kids, brd run, this post has it all.
---
This was me the other day as a mage.
---
Friend “Hurts to go down, be careful.”
---
Me “I have slow fall, I’m good.”

Slow Fall *runs out mid air while I’m not paying attention
---
Me - dead
---
Your analogy makes no sense...you signed up for a pvp server knowing world PvP would happen. You don't sign up for skydiving and hope you get a parachute.
---
He’s implying that they’re the same people. And that their rapid position change is funny.   
---
Regardless of the validity of the statement, that is the suggested humorous situation.
---
Don't like PvP, roll a pve server.  Ganking is part of the game.
---
Reminds me of this classic sketch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2b-wTJ8x3E
---
I'm an enhancement shaman with a very beloved, friend-given Taran Icebreaker I'd like to enchant. Windfury is a given with its high swing count and frequent procs, and I'd like to enchant it. What'd be a better choice, Fiery or Crusader? Thank you!!
---
^ this, and I’ll add that the majority of the people back in the day didn’t know what they were doing in regards to BiS, class/mechanical skill, and consumables. I feel like real wpvp like back in the vanilla days is one of the things we won’t be able to truly recapture.
---
He's farming the red defias mask. He probably went through STV and swam to get there. People used to do this back in the day
---
Then I’ll just continue ignoring their complaints.
---
How does that work for alliance?
---
I would beat you to the ground, pull your fat Taurens wifes tampon out with me teeth and spit the bloody tragedy into your face. All without using a Spy addon.
---
Sorry, yes you are correct, I overlooked that. The 1.12 version registers these events:
---
CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_HITS  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_MISSES  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_DAMAGE  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_PERIODIC\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFFS  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_PERIODIC\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_DAMAGE  
---
CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFF (This one was commented out saying it doesn't work).
---
Looking briefly at it, it seems it only catches players *doing* something, wether that be a heal dot, aura, spell or whatever and not instantly when they are in the players vicinity. As it says in the description "Detection is done by registering to events which are ***triggered*** by enemy players".
---
However, I can't prove or disprove that.
---
The question still remains wether the COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED passes more information compared to the CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT / SPELL events. Spy might not have been functionally possible the same way it works currently. I don't care about the addon itself, only wether these events are authentic to vanilla.
---
So try and position yourself ahead of the group towards the end of the pull, where you'll be in range of the group for the next pull. That way, you can start drinking immediately, and only stand to heal/ dps when they really need it or when you're good on mana.
---

Advice from the pros ladies and gentlemen
---
Yes wait 2 hours to get in, you can't choose to leave they won't even take your money to move and oh BTW when you finally get on after 2 hours you will give up after 30 minutes of being endlessly ganked over and over.
---
Ya, dont forget to report the hordes LOS guards in booty bay while you are at it.
---
farm up some gold in retail for tokens
---
Blizzard is considering it one world of Warcraft so not really outside resources
---
I see greatwizard, I upvote.
---
What math is wrong here?
---
Pvp was awesome before honor was released. Haha Had some great 1v1s and 2v2s.
---
oh my god yes
---
does anyone have a macro for equipping Carrot on a Stick and then Mounting that they’d be willing to share? been doing it manually which is dumb i feel

Bingo! I've been saying it until I'm blue in the face; and you'd be amazed at how few people realize this simple truth.

Um... we are. There are a lot of horde transfers. Server is starting to look great. Not perfect but moving in a good direction.
---
'I didn't have an addon in vanilla, so it didn't exist'
---
God mage PvP is so brain dead.
---
is it really? it sounds like people making an abbreviation out of it when it doesn’t need one. I always figured it was the sound someone makes when they want to whisper something to you. “pst, your fly is open”
---
wowhead shows about 60% horde. https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
If you were doing all this yourself, you'd need a level 20 warlock + 2 level 1 clickers at every location, so 3 accounts for every single summon location. That's a lotta $15/month to be paying.
---
horde mage on stalagg
---
Wpvp was awesome before honor was released in my experience.
---
Don't use r1 heal. Use at least r2. Rank 1 is a sub level 20 spell and suffers from something, I forget. But you shouldn't uae r1 heal
---
They could just release WSG early and release AV with BWL
---
I'm alliance on Gehennas and I wouldn't switch to any other realm. You'd have to pay me good money to make me consider it. 42% alliance and I get railed on the daily, but that makes the revenge so much sweeter.
---
No, you'd need 6% more hit for PvE, in PVP Weaponskill does next to nothing so you still need 5% for PvP.
---
Because retail fucking sucks
---
And add punishment for randomly killing people 40 levels lower than you in a zone.
---
Disagree
---
Meh. Still not a big deal. The info was already there.
---
Sounds like Fairbanks.

I got Divinity Original Sin 2 in a sale a few days ago and haven’t read anything about it. And I have the time of my life with that game. Ignorance truly is bliss. Way too many games these days release in a state where you know pretty much everything about it before it even releases. When the next WoW expansion releases or Diablo 4 releases, you’ll know your BiS items before you even know what char you want to play.
---
They kept asking Staysafe how he was going to punish him, just asking for retribution over something that did not affect them, truly pathetic and cringe behavior.
---
Lol I was born in ‘93.  I work a decent sales job but am not rich.  Life is what you make it.  Positivity, patience, and hard work is really the only thing that can determine how you feel about your own life.
---
i'm a sword combat spec , i have around 450 gold , i don't have my 100% mount yet , i 'm almost full blue (I have trash blade as mh). Is it worth it to invest now my gold into a krol blade (around 350g in my server) ?
---
I’ve played the game since launch. This has NEVER been “part of the game” until now.
---
He’s on a low pop server so he’s able to get a better read by controlling timers. If you watch his other videos he talks about it. I’d imagine he’s basing it on experience.
---
levelling through this is awful.  Red everywhere I go.  Makes me want to go play retail.  Thats what I get for being busy and falling behind I guess.
---
They don’t? I didn’t even know that.
---
There’s no point in even trying to argue with them. I get that they’re frustrated that they’re getting killed, but this was bound to happen.
---
If you didn't expect this when you rolled on a PVP server you are very naive.
---
Only on servers with a one sided balance.  Don’t roll on the wrong side on the wrong server.
---
What’s the issue with flying mounts?
---
Hey I'm on Horde on Herod and my guild is recruiting! What class are you?
---
If you were ally and playing you'd get it
---
Hmm maybe. But Blizzard will most likely just do nothing and take no risks.
---
For my calculations after figuring this out , I made  43g in 65 minutes and 8g worth of AH healing potions. 
---
It depends on everyone's used route for pickpocketing and the prices on their respective servers.
---
 Safe to assume anywhere from 35-55g/h.  Good to see everyone's personal experience.
---
No.  No they aren’t.
---
That sucks but this kind of World pvp will never come back after BGs.
---
ok that was awesome
---
World PvP has always been 95% trash and 5% cool interactions. There's a damn good reason I rolled PvE this time around, battlegrounds work just fine there.
---
But PvP servers are popular for a reason, and that reason is world PvP. Releasing battlegrounds early is just taking the zerg phase of the game away. It's certainly different than it was back then but it's the closest available thing to what they asked for.
---
I do think the current BG schedule is a little awkward relative to the PvE content; Christmas is much too early for BWL.
---
Works fine for my guildie. He has more honor than the rest of us. The reason it’s good is because you’re basically always alive so you don’t miss out on any of the honor. Also you can always be on the move instead of hardcasting. 
---
Maybe your server is different but our hillsbrad is literally just a stalemate in the middle. Works fantastic for our S-priests.
---
And is exactly why they added War Mode. Because almost every single pvp server aside from rp servers were all 1 sided shit shows.
---
My experience in Feralas today: Walk 5 feet, get backstabbed by 3 rogues, res, repeat. So much fun..
---
It's a good idea but there is a lot wrong with it, or at least a lot of questions that arise, when you realize that queues are for connecting to the server, not logging into a character, and when you consider having multiple characters and switching between them
---
What server are you on bro
---
You can use backstab on mobs.  That's what Gouge is for.
---
I think that may be a bug? I've respeced multiple times and never had to relearn any abilities
---
Flying mounts mean people can avoid wpvp entirely. Token gear trivializing previous content. Daily quests are monotonous and annoying to keep up with. Free epics. Sitting at queue guy and doing instanced pvp instead of any wpvp at all. A neutral main city where you can just port all over the world. Oh yeah, trivializing 2 entire continents? Also, 25 man raid groups destroyed so many guilds.
---
I'm not. I think that a lot of people are complaining because they are min-maxers that aren't able to min-max due to world pvp getting in their way.
---
The game isnt unplayable, it's just that you cant play it the way *you* want to and get the results that *you* desire. Get rid of this sense of entitlement and instead play to beat the game and you will find ways to get by. Just have to put some thought into it.
---
Thank god, this isn’t world PvP, it’s honor farming.
---
You can buy gold in retail, and then use that gold on classic.
---
That alone defeats your point, but retail is not the same game and trying to make that argument is ludicrous.
---
True
---
Posts like this are moronic. We have 10x the people in the same sized world. Of course works PvP is going to be shit. They shouldn't have released giant servers and allowed them to get imbalanced.
---
I mean if fairly balanced means not the worst then okay but that's not what people usually mean when they say fairly balanced. They usually mean it's close to even. The point of my post is clearly that it's not fairly balanced and this is a misconception.
---
LllAaaaaayyyyeeerrrriiinnngggg
---
Unrealistic???? Time invested is time invested, also, if ANYTHING, you just made the point that it is literally easier now to get where you want to go and it was much harder to get to 60 and get recipes and Go͏l͏d etc now than it was then. 
---
It’s probably a lot easier now because of the wealth of information and addons and other tools we have now also.
---
Nobody is forcing you to reroll, but the game is not going to automatically balance out every server and it can’t because that would be unfair to players who don’t mind staying where they are at. You determine your own fate by the amount of effort you’re willing to give to get where you want to be. 
---
We can’t have it both ways, with more choices comes more natural unbalance, you don’t always get dealt the best hand but you get more freedom to always change where you’re at with more options.
---
I will concede that maybe they should have limited the amount of each faction on each server at startup, but then people would bitch it’s not the real “classic” experience, so there’s no winning and it’s too late to go back now.
---
Actually im ranting about all the complaining I see in general, I wouldn’t mind being able to transfer servers temporarily, but I don’t agree with your logic of it being less reasonable now than vanilla.
---
The permanence of not being able to run away from your community “server” makes your reputation important like a real society, when people can leave any time they want it takes away from the community. BUT, they should open up transfers temporarily since the game is so new you didn’t know what you were signing up for when you picked a server.
---
Why would someone whine about pvp when they create a character on a pvp server?  Yes, it'll be unbalanced. You'll be camped.You'll get ganked. That's *precisely* what you signed up for.
---
It's much more even in retail though, consider getting back if classic balance isn't for you.
---
as an alliance rogue on herod, I've been havin a blast.
---
Or you could stop being an asskisser.
---
Afaik my server is 40/60, and that’s about as close to balance as you can realistically hope to get
---
I’ve read that American servers are hellholes, though
---
It's true, because they're making it true. They are fucking a lot of things up, server balance issues was the beginning of it.
---
False lol
---
Lmao "top end guilds" in decades old content don't let people have loot unless its for PVP? Sounds waaaay worse than I initially thought. 
---
That's why this game will be dead before all phases release. People are trying to be super hardcore at a game that doesn't have the capacity or content to cater to the hardcores.
---
Here's your options once you've cleared raid content a million times and have no more loot to get:
---
* World PVP (terrible garbage PVP)
---
* Farm gold for something irrelevant
---
But yeah lets power clear everything as quickly as possible YAY WORLD RECORD!!!!!!!!!!!!! And now there's one less reason to login. 
---
Hoooooooo boy this games rise and fall will be glorious to watch.
---
I think releasing bwl first would be better.
---
Definetly a bug! Never had to do this in 15 years lol
---
Even more so if you say, "oom, drinking"
---
Not pictured: 2 bags full with fire resistance gear, 2 free inventory slots
---
Obviously the only logical thing to do according to your post is we all play horde...
---
That would solve the wPvP ganking issue.
---
think ima just not gamble and level up a new, i could use another 60 anyways for professions etc.
---
I was perfectly fine with the PvP server till this week. I signed to a PvP server because i want to PvP, you are absolutelty delusional if you think what happens now on the servers is PvP.
---
Ive played on pvp servers since the beginning but a faction being outnumbered 8-9:1 reaally ruins the wpvp
---
Retail really tries to get you to log on every day with arbitrary daily chores that have outsized rewards. Classic tries to get you to log on every day with very long grinds that can be approached in a number of different ways.
---
Overall classic is an easier game to be casual in because you don't have predefined daily or weekly goals nagging at you to log in. Your efficiency in classic is generally defined by your ability to play the game. As opposed to retail where your efficiency is defined by your ability to log in for about 30 minutes every day without missing a day.
---
Then don’t play on a pvp server?
---
Druid, actually.
---
Oh man ist ok ... i think the Frost mage spec is Great class Design with nice immersion and ist a Great spec for all sitatuions aswell... if you think otherwise Fine !
---
    152 + 50 = 202
---
What’s wrong with the math?
---
Keep in mind that yesterday could be part of this week.
---
And? That doesn't change what I said. There are people who are still great at the game that don't have as much time to play as others. OP is also assuming that the PVP right now is even competitive to begin with. It's whoever's faction is bigger, they win. Also, telling me you play 3 nights a week tells me nothing. For all anyone knows, you play for 6 hours each night which is still 18 hours a week. Versus the guy who plays an hour each night. 7 hours a week. I'm 58. Would have been 60 if Phase 2 dropped next week instead. I'm terrible at PVP but I'm sure there are plenty of people who haven't hit 60 because they have a family, work obligations, etc and/or started late and are great pvpers.
---
most alliance left to earthfury when queues started
---
Works for pvp servers at least
---
All the people whining could have taken advantage of the free xfers...now look at them
---
Stay strong, stand with Hong Kong
---
I hate to break it to you but all  pre-nerf AV does is take 15 minutes longer to base race. That's how it played out on Northdale which included pre-nerf AV for a few months. It was the exact same base race just with more NPCs to kill.
---
25 minutes and meanwhile my boomer guild can't even clear MC in sub 5 hours, last night it took 6 and we didn't even kill rag because the last attempt (and this seems to happen ever week) some idiot face pulls rag because he doesn't like to listen.
---
The best part is after raid the officers and GM, RL have everyone stay in discord and we have to listen to them all suck each others dicks about how great they are.
---
I agree with some of this to some extent, but I have to say I also notice the posts on this subreddit can be quite naive and dare I say it, whiny, compared to most of the people I interact with in-game.
---
Griefing and ganking existed in 2005 too. Ruthless corpse camping, epic forum drama and so on. When it comes to Twitch and YouTube, I don't think as many people care about those things as some people think (want?).
---
The day honor came out we got ganked on the boat from Menethil-&gt;Theramore by about 10 horde hiding inside. Spy never alerted until they started the attack. 
---
Check out Paranoid.
---
It's the vanilla equivalent. 
---
This type of addon has always been around. Not sure why people are complaining about it now. All it does is scan the combat log and put it in a window with /target marcros.
---
Half the time I don't get a notification before the horde have started attacking me anyhow. The best use for it is actually trying to AVOID pvp, not start it.
---
And it does NOT auto detect rogues. No addon can do that. If the rogue is stealthed and you did not see them stealth, you're gonna have a bad time. This isn't some magic addon that gives wall vision.
---
what i’m saying is they have stated explicitly it isn’t coming. that makes it an impossibility.
---
I commented above good luck!
---
This is what expose armour and one extra global is for.
---
My thoughts exactly. OPs message comes from personal experience and community outcry, not hard facts about each realm. The only qualified person to be making changes is Blizzard.
---
Grobbulous has had this service for over a month horde side. Just join /uber and ask for a summon, they even have Duke Hydraxis and blackrock.
---
I'd rather go back and play it without any memory/knowledge of the game, and see it with new eyes again
---
PvP servers are one thing. PvP servers with 80/20 and worse balances are a whole other thing. Blizzard fucked up BAD allowing both facs transfers during the 1st wave of transfers.
---
Okay. So captain elitist, I've been playing the game since the start as well. I think it's pretty cringey you feel that way. 
---
Why are you spending your limited time on classic wow. Do you not remember how much time it took? If they were to CHANGE that and make it so your limited time was respected it wouldn't be the same game(which is the game I want to play) 
---
Just because you don't want to say you're asking for a change doesn't mean that is the case. What are you proposing exactly?
---
Honestly, I'm terrible at PVP and I'd probably wave back in the hope you don't kill me.
---
Classic experience in your true form
---
so for pvp i need 5% from gear/talents even if i have 305 weaponskill?
---
I don't DPS in PvE so the hitcap in pve is irrelevant for me
---
The data was already out there though.
---
Look at the wild success of private servers like Nostalrius or Light's Hope, tens of thousands of players were CONSISTENTLY playing Vanilla wow for OVER A DECADE.
---
Offering a legit, (mostly) true to vanilla blizzard backed experience?
---
Of fucking course it's going to sell like gangbusters. Who are these fucking morons at Blizzard who completely ignore empirical data?
---
You must not be playing on a over crowded server then. It takes about 6 or more corpse runes to get to BRD. Horde are relentless.
---
QQ more. I like it
---
i dont think anybody signed up to have their fps camped all day long, dungeon entrances camped, and the inability to do anything in the open world due to hours long camp-fests.
---
everyone signed up thinking they'd at least have a fighter's chance. but with the way horde outnumbers us on kromkrush, thats not the case.
---
It doesn't do what they say it does. 
---
No add-on can "auto detect" a rogue in stealth.
---
All Spy does is scan your combat log and put the names it sees in a window with /target marcos attached. You can click the name if it detected someone, but if you can't see them, nothing happens.
---
99.999% of the time (unless they're a human with Paranoia popped) the rogue will get the jump because you can't see through stealth.
---
Yes exactly. Don't play on a server where the LITERAL ONLY CHANGE is to enable griefing.
---
Heeeyyy.  Fuck youuuuuu
---
Nah but I live nearby. Geaux Saints!
---
I dont give a shit about life tap. I'm talking about spamming hellfire before the tank gets a sunder down.
---
i would transfer to a pve server in a heartbeat if i could
---
yet again you completely miss the point when its convenient. Stop wasting my time.
---
Try getting into brd at level 50 while not being a mage or priest
---
if you're not drinking as a lock after every other pull you're a cunt and shouldn't get heals... food/water is free, use it
---
Has to be a raid. It's raid chat. My bet is Onyxia spot that is supposed to be safe from her breath.
---
I'd like to add it's a good idea to get some rested xp so you don't have to run dungeons as often to get to lvl 60.
---
Razergore is slowly tipping horde bias since p2
---
CHING CHONG BING BONG
---
Ive respecced many times as priest and everytime some skills resets to 1.
---
I think it adds to the flavor of leveling, I had to sneak around hillsbrad to get some bear tongues, I ended up finding them and only getting ganked once, while a massive battle raged around me. It's a good time for rested xp, dungeons, and alts if you don't like it.
---
&gt; Please fix, blizz.
---
Nobody here can fix anything in the game because nobody here is able to. 
---
Submit a ticket.
---
Seeing in legion that the kobolds were so obsessed with their candles in Highmountain because it protected them from the void/devouring darkness really changed the entire feel of this for me
---
It really depends on the server
---
I play on a high pop server that horde out populates alliance by over double. Yeah, if you’re trying to fly into the FP in searing gorge or burning steppes you’re gonna get fucked. So land somewhere else and go around them. I’ve been running UBRS multiple times a day every day since world pvp launched and the only time I’ve had issues was landing in Thorium Point. So I don’t land there any more.
---
I'm west coast on an east coast realm and I can be up late my time which is ungodly late realm time and still play normally. We're like polar opposites hahaha.
---
i suppose this time people are aware of how fucked balance is so they dont even bother
---
What kind of self control do you lack if you can't even decide how you use your time? 
---
I didn't miss your point, your point simply sucked, sorry.
---
Fairbanks is a lot worse than that
---
sounds like you're horde. you don't have to deal with this mess 24/7 so you wouldn't understand unless you're on the one server that allies outnumber the horde.
---
sure, allies rise up and raid things, but its not constantly destroying the ability of the horde to play the game.
---
20+50+26+152
---
While leveling up to 60 groups of 5-10 alliance players were more common than single horde players out in the world, its basically suicidal to flag up as horde unless you've got a raid group.
---
I cant wait for people to start complaining about the rank 14 mafia. 
---
If they think that shit isn't going to be gate kept hah! 
---
That's ***IF*** they can stick out the 6-8 week grind first. 
---
Oh man the salt from that... 
---
I'm both moist and hard just thinking about it.
---
I always do. Quite often the enemies attacks will go from say ~60 to ~40. Seems like 10 rage well spent.
---
This isn’t true at all. I did reserve a name on Skeram but with queue on launch went to Kromcrush when it was opened. That had a queue immediately as well and went to Benediction after that. My server wasn’t the apocalypse people here are talking about but it was still horde camping all the major 50+ flight paths and roaming raids camping people. Exactly how many servers was I supposed to go to? Every single server has too many people on them because Blizzard didn’t make enough servers and instead increased capacity on the limited ones they created.
---
That’s senility speaking.  You’ve crossed the next threshold, but beware because regression to diapers is on the horizon.
---
It's the 4th day people... You can't use the first week as a baseline for what it's going to be. People are excited and they have the time to play since it's the weekend. It's only going to get better so chill out and keep your pitchfork ready for some more days.
---
Go play retail
---
You have no idea what server I'm playing on. Alliance is dominant on my server.
---
I’m not complaining about it though.
---
I mean - shit, wtf did people think was gonna happen.
---
Classic was a SUPER highly anticipated thing... saying you weren’t expecting high pops, is absurd - the literal biggest question was “will they launch with enough servers” - and it was clear during discussions pre-release (layering) he answer was clearly no.
---
As for rosy-prehonor play you def had to have stopped super early, because World PvP was pretty early into the lifecycle of the game (similar to this - literally a few months in).  Meaning you HAD to have felt it and probably quit because world PvP being a factor - or you left prior, in which, welcome to vanilla my friend, it was an absolute shit show when honor first dropped - not too far off of now.  
---
Working as intended.
---
But don’t worry - I WILL die down a TON when BGs are released.  Convenient honor, auto grouping, and great unique gear will put a stake in the life of major wPvP.  As it did prior.
---
I actually expected all of that.
---
Edit: And im fine with it.
---
Fix the glaring Heroic Strike bug and this easily turns into a 35 - 40 minute clear. Grats to them tho. Very impressive movement.
---
Explain why it's not breaking the game, because it is for many reasons. This didn't exist in Vanilla or at least was not widely known or used. It's a mod that gives players such an advantage you can't not have it. That is the definition of game breaking, immersion breaking, and dumbs down the game. It's essentially a free super power for all to use, something a mere mortal of Azeroth would not possess. 
---
Also taking it Horde is majority of the player base yes this is a minority opinion but on the receiving end of this oppressive mod, maybe my opinion is only shared by Alliance, but just because we are the less played faction doesn't mean our voices don't matter.
---
52 alliance hunter. Unsubscribed yesterday. The game is unplayable right now.
---
&gt; "Don't play on a type of server because that type is popular. Play on the type of server you will enjoy. "
---
"I rolled on an high pop PvP server and am now upset there is too much PvP happening"
---
Join pve you are gonna cry about it. I love how much pvp there is!
---
I'd get pissed too if someone came and took half my honor.
---
On Herod, it seems that I constantly run into alliance groups just camping either blackrock dm or strat and kill groups just circling camp mojachi.
---
Horde dominated server tho.
---
I too am a Saints fan.
---
Alright folks someone posted the lines! Time to move on to the next thread.
---
Joined a pve server cause I knew these problems would come and introducing my wife to WoW meant rolling Alliance, smartest choice I made
---
Check out addons like questie; helps locate quest locations, might save some hassle. Another addon is vendor price (cannot recall the name): This one just list the vendor value of all items drops. There are other addons that also might be nice to have; like the ones that show mining or herb locations.
---
Most importantly; have fun. Dont let people rush you pn your way to lvl 60 as if the game starts there.
---
No, fuck battlegrounds.
---
wpvp is so much more fun
---
Why attack k someone personally for having an aggressive opposition to your views?
---
All of this was expected.
---
That's 13.5 days of /played assuming you always played on the same character, played each and every single day since launch and never had to wait in queue. 
---
Take a few days off for being on an overpopulated server, having RL stuff, playing other games and you're well within reason.
---
"yesterday" is already added into "this week" so you're just adding "today" which is 50 to "this week" which is 152, which equals 202 "lifetime".
---
The math is fine.
---
I think it really does have a lot to do with the fact these servers have 5x-10x the players an old Vanilla server did back in the day.
---
Zones are so crowded right now that it’s almost impossible to avoid the opposing faction.  If there were 10% or 20% of the players on you had a much better chance of actually questing and getting anything done.
---
It is what we are dealing with so that’s life - but if Blizzard truly wanted Classic to match Vanilla they shouldn’t have bumped up server numbers.  Doing that can have unintended consequences.
---
Oh I see, I was including the 26 in my math I'm a idiot
---
In no way is Smolderweb balanced.  But it's definitely not as bad as most PVP servers.
---
No I distinctly remember them deadly fireball hauling rogue wizards by Stone Cairn Lake could also drop the masks so it isn’t just Westfall but it might be restricted to level 10+ defilus.
---
It won't die with the 3hr queues horde will be complaining about in P3
---
Why not just use the save button?
---
No, PvP gear is out. You can see the trinkets, capes, and bracers at the PvP vendors, though no one can get into the officer’s quarters to check out the blue and purple sets for another two or three weeks.
---
A real classic, you might say. 😎
---
That’s just being a bad at that point...unless you truly like taking a year to hit end game. 
---
Hemo swords with the juice of a solid opener is the best of both worlds, and maybe, just maybe you split points on the first tier of subtlety, but yeah, you don’t juice the daggers. 
---
Save one shot openers for lvl 60 , when you don’t have to level anymore.
---
Leatherworking supplies guy
---
Just report him. His post history shows hes just some cesspool troll. Mods will remove him as he has never posted anything to contribute to any discussion. Just some nasty bird
---
Sorry your correct I was wrong lmao
---
You guys have no backdoors to your capital cities, except for the Tram, which first requires you to get into the capital city haha.
---
shitters complaining about being shit is a new thing?
---
No changed
---
You get the way it was back then, asking to change how rage reg works is like pointless to ask for
---
You got it how it was some expected changes
---
Perfect fit for an Orc Warrior! 💪
---
The problem isn't fixed by free transfers.  There are more horde across all pvp servers, by giving them transfers all you do is compound the problem on a different server.
---
I think honestly the best fix is per-realm faction based queues.
---
eg: Alliance has 3k people online, horde has 5k.  Server max is 10k.  Horde starts to get a queue at &gt; 50% of server max pop (this obviously can be tweaked per-realm based on actual average numbers etc).  Alliance is &lt; 50% therefore no queue.  At server max, everyone is queued as normal.
---
This would still have the same server max, but no longer penalizes alliance for playing on a high pop server with a shit tonne of horde.  Because if anything these alliance players should be incentivized to play here.
---
This kind of faction based queue also doesn't break any #nochanges shit ingame.
---
But realistically we already know what the solution to this is, bring out BGs early.  Something they should have done in the first place, it was obvious this was going to be an issue, it was an issue in vanilla too.
---
oh no i have to use my brain and try to outthink a hivemind of classic wow players, what ever will I do?
---
WHAT? Lvl 54 here.  Questing with a group of 5 and occasionally getting steamrolled or taking out horde has been the best days of gaming ever.
---
See this link!

&gt;gnome mage
---
honestly this is completely your own fault for being so far behind and rolling the most killable combination of race/class in existance
---
People used the dungeon sets.
---
That explains this post. It's worse than 80/20 on fairbanks...that's the issue...not it being a pvp server. I've always rolled pvp
---
It’s just stupid to think a two word response is a reasonable rebuttal to the OP.  If you think the OP is wrong, then explain why Classic is meant to be like this.  You know?
---
BGs won't change that, it's gonna be shit for alliance no matter what. There are way more Horde players across all servers. Do you think that horde players will sit on their thumb waiting a 20 minute BG queue?
---
Source with numbers?  
---
Your anus is not a reliable source, btw.
---
I suppose that I'm waiting in a loginqueue just because those 1200 people in front of me really hate playing on a PvP-realm.
---
no wait, im afraid that this line will go above your head, so let me simplify it for you - shut up, it's fine.
---
Yep theres a guy ally side herod doing the same thing
---
Blizzard hasn't released a P3 release date. Calm down.
---
Its up to you really. Do you have the time/energy to spam ubrs for both dalrends? then do that. 
---
If you dont, Krolblade is a shortcut. However 100% mount is worth its weight in gold now with PvP.
---
I have a hunter for pve and rogue for pvp and I bought epic mount for the rogue just for that haha
---
That's why I leave lower levels alone. I want faction balance and I want to encourage them to get to 60 so they can join in on the battles.
---
If they did offer PVP to PVE transfer I don’t think they could offer the other way. But PVP to PVE paid transfer could be a good solution, and only to servers that would help balance factions.
---
I just want battlegrounds because there isnt really anything to do on off days/random times at 60. 
---
Plugging is a chore as a dps and world pvp is just huge groups of people taking pot shots at people
---
&gt; No one expected constant FP ganking.
---
&gt; No one expected massive raids locking down every high level zone.
---
&gt; No one expected one hour corpse runs just to get into a dungeon.
---
If you didn't expect that, then that's on you. To everyone else, that was 100% expected.
---
&gt; But just STFU about your ”Uhm you chose PvP lol lol lol”-idiot posts
---
OK, then stop posting whiny rants about how pvp is ruining your experience. You don't get to choose what replies you get when you post, so if you post whiny nonsense about what should have been obvious, expect responses about that exact thing.
---
Yeah, before the item rework when items in general were dogshit.
---
Horde outnumber alliance 3 to 1 on my server. How are we supposed to bring bigger numbers when we literally dont have anymore player?
---
Alternatively, plenty of tanks focus far too much on Def and make DPS wait far too long. I main a tank but people who act like threat isn't their job kill me.
---
Dont port in flagged?
---
It's not novelty, it's pvp farming. Many level 60s (including myself) literally have nothing left to do while waiting for MC and Onyxia to reset.
---
Shoot. It looks like one of the changes to classic vs early 2005 was to implement the riding skill, you’re right.
---
/s
---
NEver go full dagger
---
Swords till 60...and by swords, I mean the largest damage ranged non-dagger weapons you find as you go.
---
Swords only gets tied down to swords in combat with sword specialization, which I don’t even get to on my sub builds before I rerolling at 60
---
I think this perception about how games need to constantly come out with content is very wrong. Games need to focus on proper mechanics and gameplay. Something that has been forgotten over the past years. We play games now like we watch movies. It's no wonder most games are less fun now.
---
Ward
---
Life tap is a basic mechanic of the warlock class.
---
Any stress caused by this is a failure of communication or strategy on the part of the players, not the skill. If you are a healer who hates healing tapping locks tell them they need to monitor their bars.
---
Someone please do this on Heartseeker Alliance!
---
&gt; sounds like you're horde.
---
Sounds like you're making an unfounded assumption, because I am not.
---
&gt; you don't have to deal with this mess 24/7 so you wouldn't understand unless you're on the one server that allies outnumber the horde
---
You don't have any idea what I understand.
---
&gt; sure, allies rise up and raid things, but its not constantly destroying the ability of the horde to play the game.
---
You might try retail. It sounds more your speed.
---
It actually wasn't.  WoW was a successor to EQ.  EQ had min maxing and theorycrafting.  For fucks sake, Furor and Tigole of EQ helped create WoW, and they were the leaders some of the biggest theorycrafters/try hard guilds in EQ.  Fires of Heaven and Legacy of Steel, respectively.
---
You may recognize Furor from Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying and Foror's Eyepatch.  Tigole has references to Tigul and Legacy of Steel in game as well..
---
Tigole is Jeff Kaplan by the way.  I'm sure you've heard of him.
---
Nightslayer at top lmao ok

bliz should just make it so players who have not tagged you or vice versa do not show up on combat log
---
This is posted like once a week.
---
So you rolled on a PvP server because you want to get corpsecamped for 4 hours? Thats quite sadistic mate.
---
&gt;there are too many idiots killing civilian NPCs netting you Dishonorable Kills
---
DHKs don't matter during the first week, at all...
---
Should have been 21 right? (In US at least)
---
Back when wow released YouTube either didn't exist or wasn't being used yet.  We all used filefront and Fraps.  Getting good information about min maxing was just not possible compared to today.    Even a new game, if popular, will quickly have a billion streamers and how to guides.  I genuinely think the days of casual community experience and experimentation are forever behind us.
---
Time to level every class to 20.
---
Each layer had more alliance than the entire server does now. The ally pop is so low you can /who class+level combos at 5pm and not come up against the 50 limit. 
---
A weekend ago I had to add regions into my /who filter or hit the 50 limit. You can believe more or not, but that's the reality.
---
Ehhhh. I wouldn't say it's "more fun" that 90% of how much dps you do is based on what class you picked. Things can be not equal but balanced, as evidenced by TBC and most of WotLK. Vanilla class design mostly just feels unfinished, and there's plenty of dps specs that don't accomplish anything.
---
The patched added incentive to the behaviour we are seeing now and you're a moron for saying otherwise.
---
This is what it's all about my dude
---
PRO tip, I’d wipe us imminent, you can run to right or left and hop on ledge. It de-aggros. You can also have a rogue light the torches. It stops the respawns if you don’t have a mage so it’s more workable.
---
I get it, you've read that moonkin were not viable in Vanilla, and you are eager to show the world that you have properly ingested and regurgitated some common knowledge about a spec that you do not play.
---
Personally I am more interested in discussing people who are doing something *innovative and different* with an overlooked class than reading "oomkin are bad" and "meme spec no good for highly challenging classic WoW content" for the nine millionth time.
---
As for this being a niche application, yeah, it's niche, but it's a niche that we are *actually here to discuss.*
---
Yeah, but the numbers will start to fall off as people get bored/play alts/play other games.
---
Don't get me wrong your ass will still get camped, but you will be able to get around alot easier.
---
Sure, after we get guildbanks, you can  get your absord-triggered rage.
---
play alliance on a PvP realm, there are many threads about how they need more players on pretty much every server
---
Sub NEEDS to rush Hemo and prep before you get any zany ass ideas of branching out, and then maybe you drop 2pts in Assassination, but more likely you rush down for hit in combat since missing sucks ass.
---
When honor was released in vanilla we also didn't have thousands of people with MC/Ony on farm. People weren't level 60 just sitting around with nothing to do for quite a long time after honor and BGs came out.
---
Thought I was viewing the eve Reddit with this post for a second haha.
---
I enjoy it exactly because it dramatically altered the way you interact with the world. I have flown to the hinterlands more times in the last few days, then in the previous months combined. Dive bombing lights hope with a squad, gathering up at loch modan for the ubrs run etc pp. Circumstances change means you have got to adapt, simple as that.
---
Rogues should have cloak of shadows. It was added in a future expansion and it's pretty game breaking. Definitely one of the "no changes" that should have been changed.
---
this is a copypasta in the making. maybe we can compete with the pros like r-hockey
---
&gt; No disrespect to the preds, I'm a firm believer that Nashville sweeping them is a huge fluke and robs the Hawks of truly accomplishing what their capable of. I've spent the last few days in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire regular season watching the Hawks play great hockey it's just not fair. If the Hawks lose again I will face that the Preds deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Hawks and the NHL.
---
If they are in a BG they aren't doing WPvP. That's less horde players out there and alliance players who actually want to PvP but can't because of the "deathballs" can get a fair shake in BGs. Even if it takes them time to get into the BGs, the time they are in the BG can make a difference in the over all amount of horde players out there hunting.
---
Join pugs run by other guilds, find one you like, join the hosting guild.
---
World buffs should drop when entering raid instances.  This kind of lunacy is just further proof.
---
Except you have less balance in form of consumables, engineering.
---
This is a pissing contest. It's harder to determine the weak links in rated bgs. And it's less inclusive imo. In arena you know who's good because the scale is small and all eyes on you.
---
I’m level 59 and haven’t picked up that flight path yet. I just avoided STV all together (mostly)
---
Yeah, everyone was just lobotimized. People who took 80 days to kill Rag after Domo were just all moron cavemen back than.
---
Or maybe the difference is that the current preraid bis has fucking +250 more spellpower and +350 healing power than back then.
---
If you think the current state is anything at all like it was in vanilla you absolutely did not play it.
---
I use ItemRack addon, create sets for riding and regular non-riding gear, and keybind those sets in the addon to ALT + mwheelup and mwheeldown.
---
I didn’t play on a pvp server during vanilla, but I did play a pve server where people would yell at me in AV for leeching honor from them. 
---
The only difference is that nowadays there are more people like that. Wpvp is the same as it’s always been, it’s just people that have changed.
---
QQ more i like it
---
Just because you like it, doesn't mean every else does. And please continue parroting the classic "derrr go to pve" phrase some more. We love reading it 7 times on every sub.
---
Will they? Aren't there huge queues on the douchebag streamer server still? People can leave but they choose not to on the off chance that they can metaphorically suckle on some dickhole's streamed teat.
---
Nah. I mean I dont play Retail because it's a dumpster fire.
---
But sure, the only positions are "blizzard great" or "blizzard terrible" /s
---
&gt; It's also a tad racist to insist that other cultures have to adhere to your definitions of medicine and the like. 
---
Everything is racism nowadays, huh? Nothing racist about not thinking ayurveda is medicine. Strictly speaking, sure it does go under the term, but mostly as alternative medicine. It's perfectly fine to not acknowledge that as proper medication.
---
You are essentially calling someone a racist because he doesn't agree with something mostly used by another culture. So we can't disagree with anyone but our own race now?
---
Also, since you insist on relevant knowledge, how about around 21% of USA and indian manufactured ayurveda medicine are toxic due to high amounts of metals? Most people would define medicine as something that helps you get better, not making your health worse.

What weakaura/addon announces taunt resists in /yell?

He built his character to level 55. That's a pretty big time investment, as well as being so close to 60 to just quit. It's a bitter feeling. The dude is just looking for some advice.
---
I use the ItemRack addon. Lets you create item sets and you can make them autoequip when certain events happen, like riding, swimming, entering Shadowform, etc.
---
There's countless other games and genres that offer much more balanced and competitive PvP gameplay than MMOs which are literally built around the philosophy of rewarding time investment and player cooperation over individual skill. I've never understood the argument of people who think MMOs should be capable of offering a fair pvp experience.  You are expecting something completely different from what the product was advertised as. It's like being upset that you can't take your minivan offroading.
---
It's a problem and it's killing the game. PvP is fine. Being severely outpopulated and completely crushed 6 times OTW to BRD trying to level isn't pvp. It's crushing. It took us 3 hours to find a tank, we had to beg for a tank because the route to BRD has 40+ 60's doing nothing but killing people. 
---
When people say "move to pvp server then", it's very ignorant of the problem at hand.
---
You do realize that if the 2,000 horde pvpers are in BGs, they can't also be camping every single flight path and boat in the game, right?
---
[most likely an offhand for a rogue ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2567/evocators-blade)
---
I think that it will more than survive. If they have run out of things to do on their main, they will level another character and gear that one up until another phase gets released. Some people enjoy logging on just to hang out with guildies/friends and be social.
---
You cannot make a macro that detects someone at a certain % of HP and have it cast the most mana efficient spell on them. That's what that add-on would do.
---
And I don't need to make that macro because Spy does it for me.
---
It seems like you've never used Spy, stop hating on it when you have no idea how it even works. 
---
Half the time it doesn't help. I'm killed before spy even detects anybody near me. Sometimes it'll pop up and by the time I click their name, they've got me locked on and are starting to cast.
---
Enchantrix.
---
&gt;No one expected constant FP ganking.  
---
&gt;No one expected massive raids locking down every high level zone.  
---
&gt;No one expected one hour corpse runs just to get into a dungeon.

I did, so I rolled a PvE server.  I'm not saying blizzard didn't botch server balance, just saying that some of us saw this coming.
---
Life must be hard for you.
---
Hes not wrong....
---
You don’t have to go to south shore to PvP. There’s other ways to fight without a ton of people
---
&gt;It’s sort of like playing a a FPS game where it’s supposed to be 5v5 but ends up being 5v2. The 2 have no chance of winning and the 5 talk shit about the 2 the entire time.
---
It isn't like that at all. It's still possible to clutch a 1v5 in an FPS.
---
- signed, a player on the big side of a 70/30 realm.
---
You are not entitled to an explanation on reddit from anybody. It doesn't mean they are racist. Deal with it.
---
Pvp would be fine I'd the population was anywhere close to balanced
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Ya. Thats how they get me. If its just a dps race to see who can burst the other person down i usually win
---
I think it’s an incredibly logical assumption that if I pay for the game I should get a chance to play it. Why does this subreddit not understand that.
---
Spy is an absolute lifesaver and whenever it doesn't save your life it is at least very satisfying to add the person to your KoS list. *Just you wait till I'm 60 and geared...*
---
I was about to do some jump runs and one of my guildies asked to tag along for the hit bow. We generally just do 2 mans but we Invited him and it dropped on the first kill 
---
Getting gear for friends is such a good feeling!
---
Haven't tested any guides, because I usually just do whatever orange or yellow recipe has the easiest mats and go from there. Not sure why those guides exist, tbh.
---
But making a guide that is 100% accurate is impossible, since there is always some rng involved in skillups, unless you're making the entire journey through orange recipes. Which isn't even possible for some professions, and is never the most efficient route.
---
Even as a paladin with awesome mana efficiency. I would love this.
---
Thats why its best to do it when ur cleaning ur house, or watching TV, or going to bed :)
---
Just have all 16's and completely empty inventory, and craft into ur bags OR go HAM and have ur bank open to craft more into there :)
---
And the Dust i DE from them is kinda overflooded marketwise on my server... HOWEVER, if ur just selling the bandit masks to the vendor, u get a like double ur cash back if its ur own cloth ur using
---
Faction imbalance will probably start to fix itself when Battlegrounds come out and Horde finds themselves waiting 2 hours to get in one BG, after waiting an hour just to login to their realm.
---
Just more of a reason to get BGs released sooner than later.
---
Yeah spy is annoying. I was completely hidden in a building from horde but they all rushed the building and instantly knew where i was.. this is the shittiest addon ever introduced.
---
Im currently level 19. How do I make money as a rogue?
---
Also how do I kill things very quickly? I sort of just blindly button mash
---
Alliance on golemagg representing here and I'm having a ball
---
Gadgetzan was a complete gankfest last night. The guards are not a threat to multiple level 60s who can blow you up in a couple of hits and get away at will.
---
Why would it be ignored, we see it everyday?
---
The moment honor realeased every flight path or any contestex territory for that matter, has had entire raids of horde romping around killing anything they can, including dhk targets
---
For guiding you to locations and to help the world feel lived in.
---
well if they have queues of 15+ min they will still camp the flightpaths :D
---
Honor system\* why would you think I just mean pvp, as in contested? Anyway, "it's a pvp server" isn't a good reply. It's ignorant of the problem. I like pvp, but I don't like dying 10+ times just trying to get into BRD as a 50.
---
Just go to pve nobody will tell you to go to pve there
---
Grobbulus has had UBER for months
---
Reroll retail
---
If you are bad enough to lose a 5v1 in anything you are terrible at the game.
---
I don’t know about you, but I’m getting a bit sick of seeing more alliance than horde in Org and having to go to other cities because they keep killing the AH guys and Bankers. I don’t have a problem with World PVP, I have a problem with camping major cities just to be dicks.
---
Wsg should have been released with p1
---
I'm pretty sure the "empty bar" is enabled by default, just look under the player settings and look for empty bar. It's under cast bar and above portrait. I believe I had to turn that off when I first got the addon.
---
This is why i take a break until phase 3. I play for only pvp, playing for 3 months and still didn't get good fight.
---
whats wrong with wanting summoning stones? it doesnt really change anything, people have to run there to summon anyway. it sucks for people who have limited time to run from one side of the zone to the other or people who are there but have to wait for someone to run and catch up
---
I’m level 48 alliance warrior. 
---
Fuck you all.
---
Because you said pvp so I thought you meant pvp. 
---
You literally said they brought out pvp too soon. 
---
You don’t like pvp if you’re here crying you died to pvp.
---
Lol pallys can KEEP hreaking cc it's different. They can also outlast with heals. Trinkets give you one cc break out of the 5-6 sub rogues have. Also not every pvp trinket breaks stuns and most don't break blind or gouge (disorients). 
---
The pvp trinket is a way bigger deal for rogues than rogue opponents. Fear and poly are our arch enemies. Poly lets mages reset the fight, and fear lets those dots burn us down.
---
Meh, I’m alliance and having a ton of fun. Reddit is just a circlejerk of complaining.
---
I'm still enjoying myself. I definitely don't get ganked that many times before finding something else to do. I know it can be tough, when all you want to do is play the character that is having trouble.
---
Yes. Just like this. QQ for me
---
Not really that odd to have a single herb, single miner, and another who focuses on getting some of the blues.
---
Where did you find that population graph?
---
ELI5 - Why are Russian servers so extremely skewed towards Alliance? Wouldn't want to be a part of that 0.4% Horde realm.
---
I'm on a balanced server and thought the folks 40-59 were probably just exaggerating. Got on my 49 early this morning hoping numbers would be a little less and I could quest.
---
They were not exaggerating. I got killed by a level 60 literally every 5 minutes and about 3 of those 5 minutes were corpse running.  Half the time it was 3-5 level 60s. When I actually got to the part of the zone near the flight path, it was a raid of 15-20. 
---
Could I fuck off to some remote corner and grind random mobs, for half the XP/hour I'd get without this bullshit? Maybe. But some 60 running by with Spy who'd never notice me otherwise would likely get an audio alert and run me down, and then in BFE I've got a nice extra long corpse run. And while they cruise for ore and "honor" on their epic mount they can add my corner to their loop.
---
The way *I* want and the way *I* desire is to finish leveling up at something other than 50% gray screen and 30% xp/hour - that's not entitlement, it's wanting to play the game. But we've got servers full to the brim with min/maxers dedicated to ruining your day so they can get the ironically named "honor."
---
People like you have destroyed this subreddit. It’s become a cesspool.
---
Just get good
---
Dont put enemy actions in your combat log that aren't the result of direct action from/to them. The same response given on every one of these threads.
---
took 22 minutes to get in the other day
---
its not worth it
---
Pvp, player vs player flying in to thorium point getting ganked by 5 people. 
---
It's not  player vs player, the meta is gank from fp, gank alliance boats and if your faction is dominate, usually horde good for you.
---
OP is correct
---
Bgs need to come quick, and not cross realm. So that the alliance players get quick queues and honour to catch up.
---
Pvp good. Being crushed by 40+ 60's that all have MC gear all day in every zone that you level in not good.
---
EDIT: I assumed since you were around for the honor release and noticed the changed it did to the game. But you're dumb assumption threw me off. fml

#freeHongKong
---
I would try using a macro instead of itemrack.
---
If I got bindings right now I'd feel nothing but dread at the prospect of needing 4500g worth of arcane crystals.
---
yeah i was being very generous
---
As someone else who works in a restaurant. I know if we needed to peel a bunch of veggies quickly we would only find one of those peelers if we were lucky. Always how it goes. If you don’t need it at the moment, there are to many getting in your way. If you do need it though, you can never find it.
---
Blizzard classic forums. Stickied post. 
---
Usually the free transfers are only for the overrepresented faction in an attempt to balance the server.
---
Get a warlock or go back to retail.
---
Every spell has a school ( holy fire water nature etc. etc.), and spellpower of that school works exactly like normal spellpower except well only for spells in that school. So having 20 + arcane spell power is gives the same improvement on your arcane missilies as 20 regular spellpower.
---
Every spell also has a spell coefficient that determines how much bonus you get on the spell for each spellpower(or healing power for that matter). The coefficient is based on numerous factors like the cast time(or if dot/hot how long it lasts), and what effects it does and whether or not it's AoE. A list of spell coefficients can be found here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)  Although keep in mind this is for the maximum rank. Ranks that are learned below lvl 20 have a lot worse coefficient, and a lot of the early ranks have faster casttime which means lower coefficient.
---
I usually only do it if the enemy is high hp or fast attacking. It's generally a pretty good dps-decrease for them, but if the fight is over quickly or they're a caster it doesn't really do much.
---
Top guilds all got ony bags in the bag, so to speak. If they arent sellin em for GBank funds that is.  
---
However, its nigh impossible to aquire 12 mooncloth in the market rn, but i make sick bank off of crafting fees for it :)  60g per craft and 50g on bulk orders. 
---
Some bank alt already wants 6 of em.
---
That’s how the game works kid. Get better gear and more people.
---
Yuup
---
"And then?"
---
Omg there’s pvp on a pvp server?! Absurd! Blizzard help!
---
Uh, yes we did
---
God the ignorance is thick with you.
---
EDIT: Anymore obvious shit you would like to point out? It's exciting seeing the obvious and point it out for you isn't it. Kids are cute.
---
Gz on playing the face roll op class
---
Many servers are more than full (with vanilla numbers) and even if two thirds of current playerbase left, there would be enough for a healthy phase 6 and a new reboot.
---
That being said, it seems also clear now that Classic will never be a lot more than a niche success and population will slowly dwindle  (as this sub stats are showing)
---
Im your cesspool dont stop now to QQ Im near...
---
And how do you imagine I do that? It was that or keep getting camped in Arathi. I managed to get away from a gank squad that had control of Refuge Point long enough to port out to IF, and I got killed when I loaded in. 
---
Kinda hard to corpse flop all the way to Loch Modan and somehow not be in PvP combat for 5 minutes just to safely port to IF lol.
---
Nice try dude. While the most vocal group or even majority might not be those who are having fun, there are plenty of us that are. And I have no toon at 60.  
---
Majority faction don’t have to do anything - it’s just how it plays out. This is what vanilla was for a while, and in classic we wanted vanilla. BGs would solve one problem but create another, so I don’t see rushing them in as an ideal solution.  
---
In fact, I don’t see any solution - I’ve accepted it, moved on, and am still having fun as a mid 50s leveler on the minority faction in a high pop pvp realm.
---
 2005 all over again. These players need to go back to retail. They don't want Vanilla WoW. Caving into carebears is what killed the game. I am not against battlegrounds, but they should not be in the game yet.  
---
Unlike Battlegrounds where it is 10v10, 15v15, or 40v40, in World PvP you can actually determine the outcome by yourself. Your impact is much more limited in BGs than it would be in a small scale World PvP fight.  
---
If these players want to go play Warsong Gulch then Retail is waiting for them. Just don't tell them Warsong Gulch has already been out for the last 15 years already. World PvP in a PvP MMORPG. Make it stop!
---
son of a bitch. i'm on run #132 without seeing a single HOJ
---
Except classic is using TBC lvl guards, which are significantly stronger than the vanilla guards ever were
---
We blame blizzard for letting people transfer as ally from already unbalanced servers and ending up with 80/20 ratios
---
Read it lol
---
I want my AoE proc

#REEEEEEE
---
I think it's an incredibly logical assumption that if you roll a character on a PVP realm, that you may be stuck in a situation in which you are not able to play your character.  Why does this subreddit not understand that?
---
that's why there are dishonorable kills
---
Not even close, unless its 5 warriors vs a 60 mage.
---
Very true. My point wasn't saying if you hit 60 you didn't have a life. It was to counter OPs point that people who aren't 60 are bad. They just have a life to take care of and that comes before a video game.
---
Or the Horde village in Hinterlands
---
How can someone really be this childish? I worry about how people like you fit into modern society - why would you ever think such a toxic attitude would be acceptable? Just another person who acts tough behind a keyboard with no real value to bring to the conversation.
---
dude, that's like saying mages should get icelance... makes no sense
---
rage generation is a fundamental core mechanic, like energy, not a fucken talent 
---
how are ppl this dense
---
AFTER he deletes all his alliance ones.   On pvp servers at least.
---
PVP in SouthShore seems mighty dead ATM. Saturday only a few there and Sunday ( today ) hardly anyone.
---
Well, that's the case with most cities in the game. Mostly if you see a few houses it means in lore it's a proper city. For example Goldshire from the lore has *7000 citizens.* In game it consist of a blacksmith workshop and an inn. Not even a single house to live in.
---
This has always been one of my biggest problems with the world building in WoW. They could easily just plugged in a few more houses that they already designed for other cities (just like how practically all caves are copies of the same layout). Keep the inn and blacksmith, then add 6 houses around and it would actually look like a town just a tiny bit. I honestly don't understand why they didn't do this.
---
For pvp the problem with mace spec is that it's deep combat, which is a terrible tree for pvp, and of course it's unreliable etc.
---
As for pve, stuns are useless in raids especially random stun procs, fist weapons can be to some use sometimes, but the problem with fist weapons is that you don't get any +weapon skill, and getting +5 weapon skill is a HUGE dps increase.
---
Outside of being combat, there's no issue with going hemo as mace for example.
---
okay boomer (horde)
---
It won't stay at these levels for long, guaranteed. Many people would rather farm gold or do something else in the spare time, so if you're not super serious about rank grind there's no need to try nearly this hard.
---
"summoning doesn't change anything". literally one of the largest major changes to wow, which didn't begin until tbc, was all the portals summoning stones and flying mounts. people like Lady_Ramos are the reason "no change" people exist.
---
?? I play on a server that is mostly horde - I'm alliance - and I did all the quests in Searing Gorge and Felwood after the patch. It was hard, I had to group and pvp was a regular part of questing, and sometimes I had to rely on groups of other Alliance members rolling through the zone to help us clear some horde out so we could finish our quests but it was fully possible. The hardest part is that in searing gorge the only way to turn in the quests (if you don't log in in the morning after minmaxers have gone to sleep) is with the help of an alliance raid, but the quests themselves can be done in a small group.
---
Who cares about 30% xp/hour? Need to farm brd and MC asap to get your 'bis'? I level up, I have no clue how fast or slow its taking me compared to whatever is 'normal', but maybe that is why I'm not upset and you are.
---
I played on a Mag during vanilla. 
---
World pvp wasn’t full of people who somehow got on a roof and sat there evading guards and killing lowbies. There was a few of those, but not all the time like it is now. 
---
Most high level players spent their time helping their low level friends, not camping low level corpses.
---
There was usually like one person every couple of nights running around killing low levels, but they would kill you and move on most of the time.
---
We didn’t have opposing factions camping dungeon entrances like we do now. I remember having zero problems walking into SM as Alliance. Now the lobby of SM is being spammed with frost nova and blizzard, plus there’s so many people there that you just lag constantly, even on a very beefy pc.
---
I would participate in city raids to kill faction leaders. Those were a blast. Also sometimes we would get 40 man groups and battle in Hillsbrad, Ashenvale, Silithus, South Barrens, outside Booty Bay, etc.
---
Very few people would abuse you with the broken polymorph system too. I see videos now of mages just harassing people for 20+ minutes not letting them do anything and just polymorphing them. Usually mages would just polymorph you and then nuke you. It’s just a different community.
---
He’s not wrong.  Far easier to level two alts to 35 than get one even close to 60
---
Makes sense, you're already 60
---
This is a whine post. Go play pve.
---
Stupid comment that ignores his core point. Hello Reddit.
---
Personally I would buy a krol blade but cheaper than 350g if you can. Getting dalrends is a pain in the ass.
---
Wow Classic Is boring without PvP
---
lol this kid is horde and did not play vanilla.
---
Getting ganked by a someone you can't hit isn't PvP.
---
Any luck?
---
This. I am constantly shocked by how fast other people are moving through content, racing around like they're hyper-caffinated meth with heads. There's no thinking, no evaluating, no tactics. It's like the sole goal is to turn gaming into an automatic response with no conscious participation whatsoever. I have no interest in becoming a bot thanks.
---
dead last in the dueling tourny by a substantial margin
---
they are good raid tanks and end-game raid dps, that is it
---
pvp they dont get good until the tier where everyone 2 shots everyone
---
theyre the squishiest class in pvp by a big margin w/ no utility, not nearly as good as you think they are
---
That is why Blizzard added Battlegrounds back in 2005. Just remember something. Once BGs are released you will get your wish. World PvP will die out since you won't be able to rank up doing it anymore.
---
Mage is the fastest class hands-down because of their AOE abilities, and you can join dungeon groups that aoe farm for faster and safer xp
---
I dunno what I'd consider the easiest but Hunter as recommended by the other guy would be simple, just nowhere near as fast as a mage
---
I was calling this shit months ago
---
Lol did you really type the first line...leave...then come back less than 2 mins later to add more?
---
Why do you feel the need to insult people on the internet and then call them kids? Wouldn’t children only resort to name calling?
---
This!  Battlegrounds are going to ruin world PvP and the game, just like they did in 2005.
---
Edit:  I see all the crying about world PvP is just the same as back then too.
---
They probably know they can try and tank but they aren’t gonna have fun and they are gonna catch extra shit from the other people in the run if it doesn’t go well.
---
10k-servers and grossly imbalanced factions werent part of the old vanilla experience. Hes not specifically complaining about wpvp. Hes critizing how it was implemented.
---
Sure they do if that's what the person is whining about.
---
You know I’ve recently re specced to moonkin because the cat grind was getting old and I’ve dps quite a few brd runs now. I don’t really drink anymore often than a mage or the healer and I’ve never run out of mana in a single fight. I get it that we are not as efficient in longer fights, but it’s not as bad as everyone thinks lol
---
The issue isn't wpvp, it's the massively overpopulated servers with 65/35 (at best) balance. Faction specific queues would instantly make the game 10x better.
---
Well if classic has taught us anything, it wasn't as hard as we remember, we were just that bad.
---
To be fair they might have been dying from a dot or something.
---
Well it wouldn’t be a problem if blizz actually took action to balance servers
---
Rogues aren’t using improved sprint at level 19 tbh. Sounds like this guy ran into evasion and didn’t play his cards quite right.
---
He said 16 minutes in not to post this on reddit.
---
The problem is that it’s not you “may”. It’s that you will be stuck in this situation. 
---
You wanna quest? Too bad all the NPCs are dead  
---
You wanna dungeon? Too bad horde is camping the entrance
---
You wanna farm? Too bad horde will be all over you. 
---
You wanna fight back? Too bad, if you find a fair fight you’ll quickly be zerged.
---
 I always see multiple raids of alliance running around the higher level zones obliterating everything in sight. Yesterday there was a 5 man alliance group camping the UC gats at peak time uncontested for half an hour.
---
What server and faction are you?  The state of these servers is no where near what it was in vanilla.
---
I had a hunter need against me for the dagger from the ST dragon boss.
---
I'm a dagger rogue.
---
Edit: Also, anyone else find it crazy how popular hunters were in vanilla and how unpopular they are in classic? Kinda disheartening that so many people care about minmaxing that much.
---
ugh, why do people like you always show up in every thread about this topic. The constant camping and griefing by the horde vs the alliance on most pvp servers is worse now than it was before. It's a real problem because people are leaving the servers.
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TU14eNijRo&amp;t=1m25s) is a more efficient way to do the run. Less than 10 minutes and higher xp/h. 
---
It can be condensed into 4 pulls instead.
---
ummm no it’s not. and decursive is still in the game, it just doesn’t auto dispel for you. i’m not exactly sure how they broke that feature years ago, but you know your statement is just wrong
---
Grobbulus, but I'd rather be on a Horde dominant server. I play Alliance. Grobbulus is like 55/45 Ally.
---
I’m not sure many expected the realms to be way higher population than they were in the vanilla days. Blizzard way over estimated the number of tourists and way underestimated the staying power of classic. So much so that the realms are now all way over populated, resulting in a very different experience than vanilla.
---
My experience on one of the high, but not Uber high population realms has been way better than when I tried playing on one of the max population realms. There are just too many people on servers like Herod. The game is much better on lower population realms.
---
It was a joke dude lol.
---
Well, there is a middle ground. Goldshire is lorewise a city of 7000 citizens, in game there is literally not one house to live in. There is an inn with 3 rooms and a blacksmith workshop.
---
You don't have to add thousands of houses, but at least *have* houses is a great start. Honestly for the longest time I didn't know Goldshire actually was a town, I always thought it was just a road inn and an awkwardly placed blacksmith, maybe too poor to have a place in Stormwind City.
---
Making money is easy really, you only need to buy a few skills, saving a bunch just by selling stuff etc 
---
As far as speed goes: once you get poison at 20 it really speeds up (at least from what I notcied). 
---
Also what are you using swords or daggers
---
Yeah, I'm just gonna catch up on RL stuff and come back in phase 3 lol...
---
If you can’t strategize enough to win when you have a huge advantage then yes you are a bad player.
---
I stopped playing WoW by late 2005, stumbled upon this thread while checking the front page and have been reading for a while out of curiosity and nostalgia. Everything you said is true: I can recall being 13, coming back from school and logging in to spend the whole afternoon questing/doing PvP at STV (can't believe I still recognize most of the abbreviations). It wasn't something we did to farm honor, it's just that the quests in that zone were group-prone and if you moved alone you ended up getting ganked -- so you'd always search for a party and do both. In fact I don't remember level 60 WPVP being such a thing? From what I recall PVP mostly happened as a side-effect of having to quest in neutral zones, except for the occasional raids.
---
Certainly all this whole corpse-camp honor-farming approach wasn't a thing back then.
---
Goggles are great to have, cats eye too if you can carry them. Spam a target macro to try find them.
---
I'd say the full cp kidney is the typically the best to trinket but it can depend on the fight.
---
I've not enjoyed Phase 2 at all either. I'm not even a 'casual' and phase 2 was too early. Playing alliance on bigglesworth is horrible. I'm already level 60, and have epic mount, but I can't do anything in the open world.
---
Every flightpath is camped by horde, every boat is camped by horde. There's literally nothing I can do in the open world except body hop. Even my epic mount does nothing because 90% of my playtime is spent in spirit form.
---
Literally the worst experience I've ever had in a video game. I've not logged in for a couple days at this point.
---
Lone man needs to git gewd, complains on reddit
---
I'm just upset that so many people see DHKs as an issue already. It would be an ideal week for city raids - everyone is in PvP mood and DHKs don't matter. But no one takes the opportunity.
---
I agree with your post in general and think that this is what Blizz will do. This madness is cool, but it won't be cool if it lasts many months.
---
dude hes such a fucking champion
---
You know what you make a good point I had NEVER thought of that before! /s
---
&gt;Don't accept summons then.  Run.
---
That's how you get kicked from groups, for wasting everyone's time. If the option is there, you WILL be forced to use it.
---
Its not as bad as he's making it out to be. And it's not "half the zone", its just your combat log range. The same as quest credit. Your friend can kill a mob *just* off your screen, but still minimap range. It's not any different than that. 
---
So if you pop up on someone's spy from *combat log*, yet you're out of vision range, they still can't target you. All they can do is run around hoping they'll eventually be able to, but any rogue wouldn't stay visible for long enough to be tracked like that.
---
Might not give honor, but the salty posts on Reddit are just as good
---
I died 7 times from the FP in searing gorge to the entrance to BRM today, literally 10-15 people chasing after single players every time
---
PSA: If you want to DPS as a warrior, you can(very well even).
---
ty for sharing, i do think the run back is like the absolute worst so playing safe is ight imo but im not the best at aoe yet ikik i just wanted ppl to know u dont need invis pots really XD
---
Blizz allowing open transfers fucked the ratios beyond intolerable that's what we're mad about. Stop pretending like we're mad about pvp on pvp servers. That's a strawman...
---
Wut? The majority of the content is cut off for the minority faction on most servers due to overpopulation and too many people on one faction. The servers can't even handle hillsbrad 200+  vs 200+, dawg.
---
The dungeons all take nearly an hour there anyways, boohoo. 
---
Would be the same if your group wiped a few times tbh.
---
world pvp as it is now is fucking awful as a rogue
---
Server transfers from PvE to PvP aren't allowed.  You are where you belong, though, so don't sweat it.
---
I mean even without spy, there’s an obvious audio cue for stealth.
---
If you dont like. You can reroll facebook
---
I suspect a big part of the problem is that the horde and alliance raid groups avoid each other and just steam roll everyone else.
---
I'm calling Poe's Law on this comment.
---
As I said min maxers have always existed. But not in the proportions at all.
---
Yeah, why don’t we remove the audio cue for stealth as well.
---
Youre the reason classic will inevitably fail. Go fuck yourself.
---
Ehhh no one in vanilla thought MC or ony was hard. The grind is definitely harder and there’s no denying that. The hard part is the ahq40 and naxx. But then again those will be easier cuz we have all the knowledge available so you are correct in a way.
---
I always forget you guys don’t have a Rune of the Guard Captain equivalent
---
I never had it "resisted" in the entirety of vanilla
---
Midair projectiles or midhit breaking it sure
---
exactly. my hunter is now 54 and i am pretty much forced to do only dungeons to level. questing is rough when i get ganked every 2 min. my server is close to 50-50 (53-47 from last i saw before they banned those census mods). i would not be surprised at all if they release WSG soon.
---
It’s kind of ridiculous people saying the 60 has no chance when just about any class can global a 50 caster easily
---
Just because you're not top-tier DPS in PvE doesn't mean you're an "unfinished" spec that "doesn't accomplish anything".
---
Ret paladins can wreck faces in PvP, as can enhance shamans, moonkins...hell, Spriest and Ele Shaman are fucking monsters in PvP. Spriest is considered one of the best 1v1 classes and 31/0/20 Shaman is one of the most powerful and overall useful specs in PvP, being able to dish out massive spell crits and also function as a good healer.
---
Expand your vocabulary, GoDelyon. You say the same thing on every post.
---
They were a bad idea to put in and are what ruined retail wow to begin with.
---
I was going through this the other day too and decided a respec to swords would be the way to go until I hit 60 (respec'd at 40, currently at 45). Makes leveling a lot faster.
---
Horde so honourable they wont attack naked players
---
That kinda shit is why WoW is so great. Stuff like this plays out the same way it would in the real world. Gritty af. I just hope Blizz sticks to their guns and doesn't nerf PvP servers or some shit. They have a history of caving to the crybabies. I still remember in 2005-2006 people crying on the forums for welfare epix and getting them a year later. Hopefully the same thing won't happen here and it stays #nochanges.
---
The issue is different, this is industrial scale farming of zones, towns and fps, if you think its healthy you might be brain damaged, or probably on the zerg side soaking up all that juicy self esteem points, it's not pvp, it's not fun, it's just toxicity that will drive the players on the receiving end out. If its not fun it's not worth investing time at it and ultimately you kill your own game. 
---
This is exactly how UO died, wolves eat sheep, eventually all sheep leave or stick to safe areas, wolves get bored, game basically dies. 
---
I predict that blizzard will add bg ASAP to alleviate the zerg, or do nothing and numbers go down, they will eventually announce BC to puff them back due kneejerk solution, it was only a cash grab
---
100% agree with all of this.  And everyone talked about tansfers being a fine solution to overpopulation anyway.  What a joke.
---
This is reposted to often
---
We also shouldnt be forced to make certain class choices when forming groups just because of things like summon. It's a non-combat OPTIONAL change that does nothing except save a little bit of time so we can spend more time playing and less time traveling somewhere
---
Maybe vanilla just isn't for you if you feel it has to change to cater to your specific needs.
---
You don’t know where he is. You have no hints for finding him. And if the rogue instead stealthed out of combat log range, you would have no idea. I play in a top 2 NA guild, easily top 10 in the world. No one complains about this, not even our rogues. They already have 75k+ honor despite the mod.
---
The transfers fucking up fac balance from a reasonable 60/40ish to 80/20 was not
---
All the shit OP said was totally expected
---
If you’re within range you don’t need to do anything to appear on spy
---
you obviously didnt play vanilla.
---
Bring on some paid character transfers, blizz might as well make some more money off of them. 
---
Because you know these people are going to be good for at least a couple of em.
---
The abyss calls
---
I’m level 53.  I can’t really do much of anything because of the gank squads.  I just stopped playing and after not playing for a couple of days I started playing other games.  My original plan was to come back when BGs are released, but now I’m considering just canceling my account.
---
Im probably canceling my account because of phase 2
---
I played vanilla before you were born.
---
For starters: Spell Alerts
---
every realm is horde heavy. that doesnt change much.
---
But horde outnumber alliance overall, and are more PvP inclined. If even 10% more horde queue than alliance, we will see some pretty high queues.
---
Horde on an Ally-dominated server. Get ganked 2-3x going to BRD and 2-3x back to FP after the dungeon. Enjoying tf out of wPvP and very happy with Classic right now.
---
what class are you? 1% is recruiting for our second raid 7pm on Sundays. 8/10 mc cause we lack douses but we should have them for tonight 
---
message teezy in game if you're interested
---
They fucked with the guards like every patch in vanilla im not sure
---
I’m curious on servers with near perfect Ally/Horde balance if this is fun or not?
---
its not a slight underdog situation, i can assure you.
---
I expect people to take it on the chin instead of crying about things they are powerless to change like a child.
---
I now have Arcanist Belt. Should I sell my Banthok Sash, or should I keep it? Is there any circumstance where the sash is better?
---
Making people wait to play the game would make the game better?
---
Maybe just roll on PvE servers instead of joining PvP servers and then trying to change it to PvE culture. Just a thought.
---
Do even know what spy is? How does it affect skill at all?
---
I lost it at the boycott, like you know that functionality is easy to provide in a Weak Aura.
---
You boycotting this thing isn’t going to change anything.
---
Can you cite some bits of the text and modern medicine that proves these things aren't accurate?
---
Your first mistake was "all greed" if you all agree to roll for cash purposes, Use need. Ninja looting averted.
---
I also dislike blob camp fp pvp
---
I am playing a Warrior.  First time playing a melee class.  I was a mage back in vanilla wow and wanted to have as different an experience as I could.  I’ve found that in areas that are difficult to get to, players on both factions tend to have an unspoken rule not to kill eachother.  Maybe that’s just on my server though.  For example, Gadgetzan is obviously a nightmare, but lands end beach on the southern tip of Tanaris I’ve been grinding turtles and am usually outnumbered 4 - 1 by alliance, but we all respect each others space and I’ve even been assisted in downing large pulls by the opposition.  A little greeting emote goes a long way.  Again this is just my experience on my server (Rattlegore) but i really have to echo what’s been said previously in this thread that once this is gone it’s gone forever, so why not try to find creative ways to enjoy it?  We wanted classic, and this is the classic experience. 
---
In b4 but you’re horde, I’m always outnumbered by alliance, and getting ganked like crazy in the traditional leveling areas, still having a blast.
---
I never even said I had a problem with PVP. I'm on a almost 50/50 split server. If you all had reading comprehension skills you would've caught that. 
---
I'm advocating for the problem servers with major unbalance, which is the direct cause of people complaining about pvp.
---
Unfortunately I messed around with an alt for about 20 levels and was only 48 when phase 2 was announced. I dont have much time to play, managed to get to 54 when the patch hit. I've played that character maybe twice now since Thursday, questing zones aren't even an option if I want to make any progress towards 60 and I dont enjoy just grinding away in dungeons. It's a little unfortunate but atleast my level 20 is fun to play still.
---
 So I would love bgs to come out early, I could resume playing my 54.
---
Mongoose, Elixir of Strength or Juju Power, Winterfall Firewater or Juju Might, Juju Flurry’s (if you buy your e’kos this is very expensive or very time consuming to farm), Elixir of Defense, Mighty Rage Potions, Elemental/Dense Sharpening Stones, FAPs, Limited Invulnerability potions, then all of your standard protection potions; GFPs, Greater Arcane Protection x2, Greater Shadow Protection x1.
---
I want to put an emphasis on GFPs, I bring 3 stacks to MC at the moment because of how much fire damage you take during lava packs.
---
On my server that’s 50g+ at the moment alone.
---
This isn’t true, lol. I’ve spent extensive effort modifying Spy’s internals to suit my needs and UI appearances. Spy scans the combat log. Period.
---
The one exception—one I mentioned in my previous comment—are buffs showing up in the combat log automatically when a unit comes into range. This is why I asked if his spec has a buff that applies automatically.
---
You're making the mistake of assuming the rogues aren't 100% intent on giving the mages durability damage.
---
Vanilla - 9.5
---
TBC - 9.4
---
Wotlk - 8.0
---
Rest - 0.0
---
When getting to the dungeon is more time then the running the dungeon. Rerolled PvE so much better when you can opted out of feeding the Zerg
---
Same.
---
&gt; It is a catch all defense, but only when it’s actually true.
---
No, it isn't. 
---
&gt;People are here for nostalgia, and to relive the WoW Vanilla experience as best as possible, not to play an absolutely perfect game. 
---
People are here for all sorts of reasons. Some are here for a 1st time experience (me, as I never played vanilla), some are here to hang with friends who are much more enthusiastic about the game (me, as well), some are here to make money (streamers), some are here because they generally ride the hype-wave of the big popular game, etc., etc. 
---
&gt;But flaws that did exist should not. The sooner they start changing things like that the sooner classic is no better than retail.
---
This is just a slippery slope fallacy. Vanilla devotees are sooooo up their own ass when it comes to "what made vanilla good" that they believe that everyone agrees with them about the sacrosanctness  of the "pure vanilla game." Hate to break it to ya, but lots of people are already talking about (and anticipating) the Burning Crusade, and all the changes (gasp!) that came with it. Lots of people are talking about new additions that might be added to Classic which would change the game (such as the goblin island that was never implemented.) Lots of people are talking about the battleground that was never finished. Your point is just wrong, sorry.
---
Yeah if they aren't casting a spell on you it shouldn't show in your log...it's basically just spy lite
---
There was a really geared dagger spec rogue hanging out in the courtyard in front of mage quarters couple days ago on my server too one shotting some people
---
You do know world pvp will still be there,  it's not like it will be banned once bg's are out. 
---
For me, it sucked the first night, but after that it's not so bad on my server
---
Yes. Having servers with 4x as many people is a huge change.
---
**IF GUARDS WERE USEFUL** it would alleviate the issue a lot
---
Shh. Don’t tell them about our perfect server bro
---
Imo don't rush content. This too shall pass.
---
People expected world pvp like they had at the time, not being chain ganked by entire raids of levels 60 everywhere making impossible to play in some areas.
---
Because why have an organic world pvp experience when you can just use the spy addon to track the opposite faction players and beat them 4 v 1 ?
---
The dumbest people are always the loudest
---
Yes, spending 5 hours with friends is a terrible experience.
---
... and ?
---
Man I guess those professional CSGO and R6S players that this happens to are all fucking terrible and need to git gud then huh
---
Maybe they should be paying you for coaching since you're such a video game genius
---
You either didn’t read what I wrote even though you quoted it or didn’t understand it in the slightest, also you’re a dick for no reason.
---
Can't fix stupid
---
There's always going to be a decent chunk of players in the 48-59 range. That's when leveling slows down significantly and you even start to run low on quests. It's a very large level range.
---
You're just pushing the problem over to the people who are a bit slower than you instead.
---
 Gotta be a Chinese gold farmer right??
---
Every class can’t be good at everything. Warriors are best raid dps, best tank, and very good at group PvP. Being below average at 1 v 1 PvP is a small sacrifice to make. Someone has to be last place in 1 v 1.
---
You never played classic did you? That's what SS/TM always looked like, just less people.
---
Ah derp, I confused intimidating shout with demoralizing shout.
---
wut
---
I think things will get better when BGs are released.  I can’t do anything without 5+ 60s pounding me into the ground every time I rez.  This forced break has kinda made me move on.  I may go back, but I’ve been playing other things and not even thinking about WoW anymore.
---
How it worked in vanilla.
---
You don't enjoy the 'classic experience' with 3-4x the old vanilla late game server population? I fucking love seeing 50+ horde at every flight path, boat, instance entrance, etc. It's such a great experience I am literally cooming.
---
Also let's change the population limits but not change anything else, have fun with black lotus mafia and getting herbs/mining nodes!
---
Never forget, #nochanges!
---
Faction cap would be a nice thing for start.
---
It’s interesting how people have jumped on my comment to justify the existence of Spy as an addon when I didn’t actually call it out as a bad addon. I just think that some things said about what is happening sounds cheaty to me.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That said, I appreciate your comment because you have given insight in to how this was a thing in vanilla. Therefore it’s tough to argue against in my view, especially if people are in the #nochanges camp. What’s changed is communication and knowledge - both happen more now so Spy is more prevalent than the vanilla addon you mention.
---
I guess blizzard have a choice, leave it in the log and/or addon api or cut it out somehow. I think based on what you have said they’re likely to leave it in and those who don’t like it will have to learn to live with it.
---
You dropped this \

55+ And I've got like 3 quests left in the world. What else can I do but dungeon?
---
go back to retail
---
I like traveling to instances. Being out in the world instead of waiting in town because 2 people were closer. That travel time slows down the game. Summoning stones speed up the game, flying mounts speed up the game. LFG speeds up the game. I like the slower pace of classic. Everything doesn't have to be go go go.
---
The problem is that you cannot break this addon's functionality without breaking tons of other legitimate addons.
---
I ran into the same problem. The cause was Questie. 
---
Only workaround i found was right-clicking on each quest in the quest tracker and disabled the icons on the mini map for each quest in Un'goro.
---
My dad works at Nintendo.
---
And people like you are ones who don't know how to differentiate between negative change and positive change.

Pretending that summoning stones was a negative change is simply being delusional.

Only situationally, once bgs are out all the rankers move there

You're wasting your time, bullies are fine with the broken system as long as they get theirs
---
We had 15 Ally grouped up last night in EPL and were killing for like 10min before horde told their guildies and a raid of 50+ people showed up.. I’ve been to winterspring, WPL, searing gorge, burning steps, ungoro, silithis, blasted lands.. literally EVERY higher level zone has raids of 40+ horde roaming around and most groups you see for alliance are MAX 15 people and usually around 5 people per group
---
It’s fucking stupid and I’m only raid logging now. GL ranking as horde with no alliance to kill
---
Yes of course. Horde also have a far easier leveling experience for the majority of players. There are exactly 2 dungeons inconvenient for the horde while leveling - deadmines and stockades. Alliance have rfc, wc, rfk, rfd, sfk, and all four sm (hugely important) being really dangerous, inconvenient and time consuming to get there. And before you say gnomer for the horde, there’s a teleporter.
---
Horde have way better town to town transport, centralized flight paths, and huge advantage in stv with two flight paths, a central town and really easy access to both from your hubs.
---
Vanilla didnt have faction balancing.
---
Gl
---
Then why does spy receive notifications for people flying above you on a flight path?
---
No, inexperienced players. Now they know.
---
Improved sprint was a life saver leveling my rogue on a pvp server
---
I doubt he is the *only* person ever in all of classic who could benefit from summons.
---
Ah yes, I see. History repeats itself.  
---
I remember when they introduced the Honor system back in vanilla without any BGs. They pushed out BGs very quickly afterwards, largely because they needed to react to the massive outcries on the forums. Apparently, a lot of people couldn't play the game anymore because every zone was a battlefield.
---
It's true, and this is the exact same thing people think about pre-nerf AV these days on all the pservers, and yet this subreddit is absolutely _convinced_ they'll love it just like they were convinced they'd love this pvp patch.
---
I sort of want Blizzard to release the un-nerfed version just so everyone can see what a braindead snoozefest it is to stare at an AoE'd bridge for 2 hours straight without getting any progression.
---
What of it?
---
&gt;The issue is different, this is industrial scale farming of zones, towns and fps, if you think its healthy you might be brain damaged, or probably on the zerg side soaking up all that juicy self esteem points
---
I never said it was 'healthy', I said it happened in Vanilla. Either way, I'm on Alliance on a horde imbalanced server and definitely not on the zerg side. 
---
&gt;it's not pvp, it's not fun, it's just toxicity that will drive the players on the receiving end out. If its not fun it's not worth investing time at it and ultimately you kill your own game. 
---
It is PvP, and most people do have fun otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. You don't think it's PvP, and you aren't having fun. That's the distinction.
---
&gt;This is exactly how UO died, wolves eat sheep, eventually all sheep leave or stick to safe areas, wolves get bored, game basically dies. 
---
No, this is definitely wrong. I played UO from the beta days when mages wore plate and used hvyXbows to well after Trammel was out. The reason that UO died was because Origin was acquired by another company that everyone hates (take a guess at which one), and catered to the trammies. 
---
The entire trammel facet is what ruined UO, not the PvP.
---
The reason people came back to freeshards/private servers that were pre-UOR (or UOR without Trammel) is because they wanted the PvP that you are saying killed servers. 
---
&gt;I predict that blizzard will add bg ASAP to alleviate the zerg, or do nothing and numbers go down, they will eventually announce BC to puff them back due kneejerk solution, it was only a cash grab
---
These predictions sound awful, I hope the wPvP remains as long as possible because it's a lot of fun and the people complaining are the ones that think that leveling on a PvP server without honor and with layers is the real experience.
---
in a pure gameplay standpoint it was better.
---
But i always found outland really really really boring and kind of a shitty place in comparison to azeroth, which was much more bigger and fun to play and travel in.
---
Also, BC invalidated a lot of azeroth content-wise (why raid or doing high level dungeon here when green items in hellfire peninsula are better ?)
---
It's okay, you don't need to retcon a humble brag from your 2005 guild.
---
Going for golden pearls prob.
---
??? They literally remove half of the world pvp.
---
I thought I had replied to this when I saw it the day you posted, but thank you for the explanation. So now I am 60 and I did almost every Thunder Bluff quest while leveling. I missed some that were like, "now that you've killed the rare beast and he's dropped his hide, take it to hunter &lt;thunder bluff npc here&gt; and get your reward". Those quests just aren't feasible to complete. I'm 10290/12000 honored, so just on the cusp of being revered which is slightly disappointing. That implies I'm just short of half-way I think?
---
I was doing the morrowgrain thing on the side but I heard rumors that the yield of useful herbs is severely reduced if you're not a herbalist. I kept getting earthroot, mageroyal, etc which go for a few copper. Meaning the 10 silver I used on the seeds and the sometimes very expensive soil was a complete waste. Turning in the morrowgrain is nice especially for a warrior since it yields some food/potions but I just don't know if it's even worth holding the pack/seeds/soil with me since I'm not an herbalist. Do you know if it is? Am I saving a tiny amount of money that would have gone to runecloth or is it likely breaking even/wasting money?
---
There are still some TB quests that are tied to long 60 quest chains or instances, etc. But luckily 95% of the TB quests that are now grey are ones that I've done at the appropriate level.
---
Still though, I'm at 561 gold and I have to now decide: should I spend a ton of that gold on Runecloth, take **even longer** to get my epic mount (since I'd be out a few hundred gold), or should I just buy an orc wolf for the 900 gold and then somewhere throughout the next year save up another 900 gold for a kodo? Buying two epic mounts would suck really, really bad but at least I'd have an epic mount sooner than later. I'm not really sure what the best decision is. Any idea of an estimate of how much Revered -&gt; Exalted would cost purely through Runecloth?
---
But you can travel any time, why is it so important that you do it when other people are waiting on you? If I am trying to do a dungeon I want to do the dungeon, not stroll through a forest or sit on a taxi doing nothing. I can do that any time I want. Are you going to decline a group because a warlock is going to summon you?
---
It’s called a hobby. You could make this argument for literally anything.
---
That being said, I’m casual as fuck so what do I know.
---
You still haven't provided some argument or reasoning.
---
Dedicated gank squads exist because it’s the most efficient way to HK farm.  That won’t be the case when BGs are released.  While there may be some gank squads that are roaming about for shits and giggles they’re not farming HKs in the most efficient way.  Because of the lack of efficiency the number of gank squads will decline.
---
I'm sure there's a large group of people who thinks flying mounts and LFR would be really cool because they don't have much time in classic either. What's your point?
---
Sounds like you fail
---
I completely agree.  It's broken.  Sadly this subreddit has shown mostly support for the addon.
---
I made an Alliance rogue just for Heartseeker. Can’t wait to see what it’s like to dominate. Also cuz Faerlina is just a 3 hour queue everyday
---
What do you mean with „catch up“? You understand that you rank versus your own faction. More honor on horde doesn’t mean it’s harder for you to rank as an alliance. Also: most alliance guilds dominate honor rn on my realm and that’s a 70/30 h/a.
---
Hey if you have to resort to insults because you cant propery explain yourself, maybe you should do some self reflection.
---
Bold of you assume some of these people are capable of holding a job.
---
In all seriousness I assume the people doing this are on disability or already retired.
---
How is that blizzards problem? Sounds like a community problem.
---
&gt;He’s implying that they’re the same people.
---
The humorous situation is based on a strawman argument then, just to he can feel morally and intellectually superior.
---
To the people who disagree with me, can you provide evidence of someone posting in this sub how he really wanted World PVP, but now he really wants BGs? Same person, provide proof please.
---
This is what makes classic great tho seeing a dude with the rank 14 title is a thing to see. I mean that person must be the ultimate neckbeard with a $300 gaming chair soaked with piss. That person deserves it
---
The “suck it up buttercup” mentality is contrary to how any change occurs for virtually anything. 
---
People have complaints. Reasonable complaints. And telling them to shut up because they aren’t happy with the state of the game is ridiculous behavior.
---
Commenting to remember to use save button.
---
you must run with some terrible people
---
Banthok is still better for PvE because of the 1% hit, the belt gives more int/spirit/FR so potentially better in a few situational fights.
---
You realize that on all the english servers (for example), 19 are pvp and FUCKING FOUR are pve (and two are full right now, imagine back then at launch) ?
---
Most of the people didn't had a choice. It was either joining a pvp server or never play at all.
---
Same for most of the other countries. France have 4 servers, 3 are pvp (and the only one not pvp is full), Spanish only have one pvp server, Russia have 4 pvp server and 1 normal, and only germany have a "balanced" ratio with 6 pvp server and 4 pve server (which two are full).
---
You could stack all those pve server on their maximum limit and you would still have dozen of thousand of pve players stucked on pvp servers
---
You realize that TBC prepatch had arenas right?
---
Tram was an attempted solution to satisfy both sides, if you think they came up with the idea out of thin air you are fooling yourself, they were bleeding subs, the solution was of course terrible but the direction was already clear, regarding everything else,  to each their own, enjoy the game I guess
---
So nobody should have any hobbies at all and should devote all of their free time to the pursuit of capital?  That's the logical conclusion to your line of argument.  It must be a sad existence to think of everything in life in terms of money and earning potential.
---
Who works for $10/hour 7 days a week?
---
Obviously I don’t because it doesn’t take me 20 minutes to get into a fucking dungeon.
---
Yeah but do you have two wife, eighteen kids, and work 90 hours per week?
---
Sulfuras is good
---
Yeah, people today use voice chat much more. Premades will come with known strategy and coordination and pugs will have no chance.
---
“Everyone”. WPVP is awesome and I’m having a great time even though I’m just questing and watching death squads fight each other in EPL.
---
lol no
---
Instant gratification doesn't fit in here at all, it's one of the other boomer talking points. The one where they complain that kids these days want everything to be 200% fair in every way so that they're protected from losing at all cost. 
---
I've actually seen a guy unironically rant about matchmaking in competitive games and how it's creating safe spaces for kids. The same people of course 180° immediately when they happen to find themselves on the receiving end
---
Rule 1 
---
&gt; Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers, current World of Warcraft, streamer drama, etc.
---
To be honest, it surprised me too. Playing world pvp as a rogue on a pve server means the only world pvp is the big SS vs TM battle. Guess what happens as melee? Insta death. So what do you do? Afk mount for maximum honor knowing all the healers and ranged damage are getting more honor than you. So basically since I rolled the wrong class day 1, I am doomed to not get even close to rank 14. So it feels pretty bad, but I guess we all came to classic knowing it has fatal flaws. It just sucks not seeing this one coming.
---
Heroes of the storm is (was?) free to play 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
So is hearthstone. Where is that game?
---
Yeah. It's interesting when the general populace is informed and in bis.
---
its cuz minmax mentality ruins the fun, if people played for fun instead of reward this would be perfect alas
---
If you cry about sharing honor from 1 scout ranked player... you got problems.
---
Never said I was too lazy to run, I just said I don't think it would kill classic wow if it was added.
---
I feel bad for rogues.  First thing I do when a stealth player is detected... pop perception and mount up.  They don't stand a chance.
---
Yup, crippling poison and bleeds. Most unfun a warrior can have
---
What in the fuck went wrong in your life that lead you to this?
---
That’s sick can he get me one of the original Pokémon crystal editions in mint condish?
---
Buffs.
---
I really don't understand why they don't implement faction specific queues.  It would solve the problem overnight.
---
Them 8 hour WSG graveyard camping while holding the flag BG's 
---
Fuck I can't wait.
---
Get that shit on farm!
---
&gt;making people wait to play the game would make the game better?
---
Yes it would, because the problems with the game are being caused by overpopulation and faction imbalance. Put up faction queues, people who are willing to wait for a better experience get it once they get through queue and people who don't want to wait can take the faction locked xfer to a server that needs more of their faction. Everyone wins.
---
Same dude. Thats what all these children dont understand. Half the population is literally just gonna roll out and classic will just become another iteration of retail. It was the mentality and the spirit so much more than purely the content that made vanilla awesome. Theyre wrecking it and the best responses they can come up with are “go roll pve.” All because they cant fathom the concept of fair pvp. Its insane. Ima just sit back and watch it burn via reddit at this point
---
&gt; it just doesn’t auto dispel for you. i’m not exactly sure how they broke that feature years ago,
---
That's literally breaking it. Just because you don't know how something was done, doesn't mean it was impossible to do lol. You just countered your argument with your own sentence.
---
&gt;World PvP you can actually determine the outcome by yourself. Your impact is much more limited in BGs than it would be in a small scale World PvP fight.
---
What was that actual sentence lol, world pvp has only 1 outcome atm; whoever has the most bodies win, that's all, there's so little you can do if you're the side that has a smaller number.
---
You got it backwards, BGs are determined a LOT more by your plays (the smaller the BG is, the more impact you actually have). Just think about a bg that has a good healer on one side vs one that has a bad one. It litteraly wins you the BG, idk what's 'limiting' about that lol
---
Im just ignoring the last 4 paragraphs since they are not related to what i wrote and seem mostly like they were you just going off om a tangent.
---
Time invested is not just time invested. The value you of that changes all the time. Rerollling away 3 months is vastly different based on what you did in those 3 months.
---
Not to mention all the friends you've made and guilds you've invested effort and time into make great.
---
Warriors, remember not to invite rogues to your group in order to suppress the ***Stealthed Menace*** from growing more powerful
---
Whose stopping you from playing the game? If you rolled on a pvp server this is a part of the game. The only one stopping you from playing is you. If you didnt want that pve servers exist and are available right now. 
---
This is such a bad opinion.
---
Hi, /u/test54674

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxrjnc/unpopular_opinion_phase_2_should_go_12_weeks/). 
---
I mean i'm glad they released DM early so i could get my epic mount lol
---
MC is very very easy btw. You can easily do it.
---
Then why not have them be on PvE servers and not PvP servers if that's your complaint?
---
Hell, I don't even agree with the premise that ganking people trying to run dungeons is a good form of wpvp in the first place-- but I'm sure you'd be able to have people camping summoning stones if you care that much about it.
---
All is fair in love and Warcraft.
---
Sorry I disagree. World PVP makes the world feel so much more alive. I am actually not looking forwards to BG.
---
Well if you're not in a premade and you face a premade in WSG, you know you've lost anyway. You can tough it out or just quit the bg.
---
Yeah method has this really good mage playing named jokerd
---
Good! It’s bad for the game as a whole. Not so many people as you think are enjoying this.
---
That would be a true vanilla experience. Waiting till the tank got five sunders of before DPSing and warlocks still pulling aggro.
---
You will never get everyone to stop using an addon unless it is banned. It like asking rich people to stop using loopholes to save on taxes. People will do what benefits them if others are allowed to do it. Also, raid parties are using Spy to find their targets, why shouldnt the targets use it to run away as soon as they notice 5 to 10 names pop up on it? It may already be too late by then but it gives them a chance at least.
---
&gt;Tram was an attempted solution to satisfy both sides, if you think they came up with the idea out of thin air you are fooling yourself, they were bleeding subs
---
I'm going to stop replying after this because I can now tell you're completely full of shit.
---
Trammel was introduced in 2000. 
---
Between 1997 and 2000 the subscription numbers DID NOT DROP at any point, they were increasing from 1997 to 2000. 
---
The first time UO experienced a subscription drop was in 2001 AFTER trammel was released.
---
&gt;the solution was of course terrible but the direction was already clear, regarding everything else, to each their own, enjoy the game I guess
---
Of course the solution was terrible, it was because they got rid of the world PvP that made the game great.
---
And that's exactly what you're trying to do.
---
Ops mum
---
+1
---
Flying mounts were too fast and went too high, if they were lower and slower so ranged could attack it would be a  lot less of a pvp killer. But bc was still better imo, and you could gank just as easy, landing on people from an epic mount is almost as good as a rogues stealth
---
Yeah thats the point im trying to convey here. Im not even playing, im making an observation based on what ive seen. All these people (such as yourself) are gonna literally roll the fuck out and the spirit of classic dies with them. What happens when these “go roll pve then” dipshits are all thats left? 
---
After some of these other responses, good riddance is all i have left to say
---
https://ironforge.pro/
---
While we dont have any 100% reliable server balance resources. This site seems to be what people agree is the best we got it for right now. As you can see kromkrush is at 42/58. That is pretty damn good considering other east coast pvp servers like stalagg/skeram/herod/heartseeker are all worse. 
---
Faction imbalances suck and I think it's a big problem for classic. I'm just saying kromkrush comparatively is not that bad off and a lot of us would love to be on there.
---
It's not an insult when you can't even read what you're replying to. Think before you reply eh?
---
Can get a week's worth of wpvp honor in an afternoon with this one simple trick!
---
They arent reasonable complaints because your solution requires the game to change how it operates. The solution to wpvp os to fight back or transfer to another sevrer with a better ratio. The solution will change when battlegrounds come out. Your complaint has one solution. Release of bgs. Which are coming. Its been two days chill out. Take a break. 
---
Blizzard shouldnt change their release schedule off of one weekend of wpvp. Thats an insane fucking suggestion.
---
then you obviously are not on the smaller factions side of your server where you get killed so much you have a rez timer before you make it 1/2 way to BRM from either side
---
You can get rank 14 when bgs come out I guess
---
Once a battleground exists 99% of the people doing world pvp will sit in town and chain queue; world pvp will be permanently dead.
---
Some of the best leveling gear and a fun way to break the monotony of leveling
---
1. What is your professional opinion on the recent regrowth spec meta which almost always results in the druid innervating himself rather than a priest?
---
2. How about the value of innervate on a priest in later classic when mana is a problem? Will that allow for a second druid or would a priest or paladin still be preferable? Honest answer/opinion please even if it is zero resto druid. I want the cold hard truth.
---
Hell, I'm a 60 priest and the game is unplayable for me too... and I'm horde on one of the most horde skewed realms. 
---
I have 2 options atm. Join a zerg to get a minuscule amount of honor or stick to PvE. Because the alliance are outnumbered they are always grouped up. And since they can't really compete with the horde zerg raids their motive is to always keep moving to avoid the zerg and steamroll any solo players they find. No overworld solo content can be done, RIP to every priest trying to get Benediction for the foreseeable future. 
---
It really feels like a lose/lose for everyone involved. The WPvP I encountered before phase 2 was so much more satisfying and felt much more organic.
---
And don't even get me started on spy. No tactics for anything, its simply ping the location and then everyone steamrolls over the alliance. 
---
Fun, engaging content and player interaction has now been turned into one of the most boring grinds I've ever experienced in this game. And outside of instances that's pretty much the only content I can do atm.
---
For a time every single PvP server was full so what other choice was there?
---
I think you're reading too much into it. I also find it kinda funny how it all worked out.
---
Another person who can’t understand it. Probably horde. 
---
See literally any of my other responses to see how unplayable it is. 
---
And seriously get the holy fucking hell out of here with that roll PvE server bullshit.
---
Can't meme around these parts. These are trying times.
---
Right lol, doesn’t even matter that he was in full bis with enchants. It’s simply mages op spells against melee classes, a bit of experience playing the class, and the FOP he popped. If these were dagger rogues they could just triple ambush and gg or double vanish but they’re all pve sword spec. Lot of people talking shit but you already know this mage would shit down their neck just as hard if not harder.
---
It's a PvP addon that is so beneficial that even players who hate it (hi) feel like they need it to be on a level playing field.
---
"tHaT's ExAcTlY wHaT pVp Is"
---
Fucking Christ, the current state of affairs has never been standard back then nor on private servers. Did you miss the second part of my comment? An unplayable world has never been an issue in WoW. Stop acting like it's business as usual. Never was, never been. This is exceptionally different.
---
I am sure it is enjoyable on Horde side but no matter the way you slice it, Alliance is outnumbered. No matter how you organise, if the other side organise similarly, you are fucked due to numbers. Moreover, maybe my guild is shitty but none of them are going to make a 15 man raids to defend me while I am fishing or farming elementals.
---
Again, I am not a carebear. I played EvE and Darkfall, both of which were a lot more hardcore for PvP. But the mindset of most players and the world is built accordingly.
---
No, that's not \*exactly\* what PvP is on WoW. The last few days is an exception in the whole of history of World of Warcraft. Nothing about it has been the norm in this game for 15 years.
---
Could you let know when you've added this? thanks.
---
K
---
The big issue is people who had this nostalgia about world pvp are not going to get remotely the same experience with the server sizes we have. For that to be possible we would have to cut every server down to what alot of people would call "dead".
---
As many have already pointed out it is but at the same time it very much isn't the same.  In 2004/2005 I played on a pvp server that had 2000 people online on a Friday night that was split very close to 50/50.  Now I play on a server with 4500~ people (numbers I saw the other day, not sure how accurate) and it's closer to a 33/66 split.  
---
So not only do you have one faction severely outnumbered, but you also have way more people for the same amount of space, making the faction imbalances feel even more severe.
---
A well raid geared warrior can do just as much damage even quicker
---
My friend has 1000 honor with 400 honorable kills. I have 400 with 10-15 kills. The meta will shift to small squad pvp soon.
---
dont get your downvote and quote thats out of the context. I play pvp server coz i belive thats the way all mmos should be, just blizzard introduced world pvp in wrong way. Mechanic itself is fine.
---
Yo I don’t think benediction is high pop. Compared to other servers. I get griefed too. It’s every single server.
---
They are ABSOLUTELY reasonable. Are you insane?!? 
---
Your solutions are flat out ignorant. We all do fight back and then get corpse camped for an hour. Doesn’t mean we stop fighting back. 
---
And transfer to where? Another server where it’s exactly the same?!??
---
Jesus people are so stupid on this subreddit.
---
They are negative. I am team lots of changes, but this one is honestly just stupid.
---
We did not have the same info we had in Vanilla. Mini maxing is king currently, much more so than 15 years ago. Correct me if this is inaccurate but did the game play out like this when honor was released in Vanilla?
---
Kromcrush rarely has a queue. The server is decently balanced. I think we have 55/45 favoring horde
---
okay i do agree with what you're saying, but... ''Even then, there would be 1 raid in Hillsbrad, maybe 2 (not 237 like my spy mod showed yesterday when I went to hillsbrad). Otherwise you could roam in a 3-5 man group or solo and be just fine.'' if we assume a raid to be 40 people, 237 raids would be 9k people... well over the server cap.... i really don't think that happened
---
Why wouldnt they allow it? Such systems were never part of vanilla. I havent read a single comment that expected faction balancing,
---
That's a pretty big false equivalence. What's your point with that?
---
This is the truest comment on this thread. Many of the complainers only play on a pvp server or classic at all because its the hype thing to do.
---
Because it’s not implied and it is not standard. Some states like Utah use %weight in their laws. Yeah it’s dumb, but it’s just a specification that is required.
---
I’d say 45/55 is as balanced as you can get, which is the ratio on my server. But seeing all these salty people here is worth so much more than any rank.
---
The best posts are the ones in which they blame the opposite side for their own poor choices. I look forwards to coming home and joining my guild’s kill squad and have fun with PvP, on my PvP server, which I picked because, you know, I wanted PvP.
---
PvP.
---
Yeah, that's why I prefaced by not being sure if you're kidding. I get the implication, but not the joke.
---
I'm not saying it's ideal but you had to know it was possible.
---
But it literally did. The world died in TBC when flying mounts and using summoning stones became wide spread.
---
The other faction out populated mine by 2/3. Quit making fucking excuses. I ran to BRM 4 times yesterday and died a total of 3 times.
---
Why? At least you get to get away and pick stragglers.
---
I don't think you know what that means.
---
Thank goodness this isn't real life where the barn would be burned down normally.
---
yeah I've already started training myself to never even get close to SS
---
I would upvote this more than once if I could.
---
rez sickness is a punishment, not a reward. Sorry not going to change
---
From my experience it is mostly non private server people complaining. Those who played on private servers knew this was going to happen and did warn everybody what it would be like.
---
Yeah, overcrowded zones are bad regardless if those crowds are friendly and fighting over mobs or enemy and fighting over mobs.
---
Hahahaha
---
Its exactly the opposite haha. You can be the one to cap the flag, ninja the last base, return the flag for the win.
---
you are asking for something that was changed in **the middle of WotLK** to appear in classic... at least Ice Lance was added in TBC.
---
&gt; rage generation is a fundamental core mechanic, like energy
---
yeah and this fundamental core mechanic was also changed in WotLK, yet it's still the annoying 20 energy per tick in classic. Lets change that as well!
---
how can you be this dense
---
i would rather have world pvp for a while than to push forward too quickly with BattleGrounds.
---
I can tell you didn't actually play vanilla because there were similar addons...
---
you said they removed it (one feature was removed). but even then that isn’t the statement i was talking about. i’m talking about you comparing the removal of parsing combat logs to the removal of of mages that was just wrong lmao. sorry for the poor clarity
---
So glad I took the free transfer. My realm is pretty balanced for world pvp without having a serious impact on people just levelling. Many people warned about so called “dead” (Medium pop) servers like the one I transferred to but it’s thriving and really the classic experience I wanted. Org is still busier looking on weekday evenings than my old vanilla realm which was one of the bigger ones. Couldn’t be happier
---
If PVP without battlegrounds was "vanilla" why was it only in the game for 7 out of about 100 weeks of vanilla?
---
People want the sense of danger while leveling or the ability to fight over resources. Dude mining rich thorium? Stun him and take it. What we got was transfers that destroyed faction balance, too few servers overall, and an honor system that encourages you to purposely ruin the game time of others. I know while leveling, there were a few times I got attacked but managed to turn it around and get a kill. That feels amazing and really gives you a morale boost. Having teams of 60's roaming every high level zone camping everyone isn't fun. It's not like its just 1 group of jerks, its literally anyone with some sort of interest in PvP doing it.
---
theres like 5 servers with really bad imbalance.  if you wanted perfect 50-50 this isnt the game for you.  its not possible in any fair or reasonable way.  just go play retail this is what the game was about.
---
It's fun to watch on streams in the background at least.
---
Heres my reasonable complaint. I rolled a pvp server and my faction has less players so i get killed more blizzard please change your release schedule for millions of players because i and my guildied are upset at a completely optional part of the game that we chose to partake in. Now i know you offered us free transfers but i didnt take them because i wanted to be on my server for whatever dumb reason even though anyone with half a brain could see the pvp tornado coming down at us. But now i want you to change the entiee plan you have because for 4 days of pvp im unhappy.
---
This is dumb. Such a dumb fuckingmposition. Give it soem time. Take a break from the game for a few days. It will calm down. Its the first weekend. Chill.
---
Untrue 75% of servers are horde heavy.
---
Sure, I am just saying being lvl 60 and 3hours a week is all it takes to raid right now and you can have a lot of fun there. If you check that poll that was here recently like 80% of lvl 60s did MC so its not hardcore at all.
---
Oh look a rogue complaining about spy.
---
Learn new words, Bro!
---
Yes.
---
&gt; and are what ruined retail wow to begin with.
---
I don't see how THAT is specifically what ruined retail.  That's hilarious to put everything wrong with retail on those specific facets of the game.
---
Hey, don't call him bud, pal.
---
Does anyone actually go back to the things they saved?
---
It was like this in vanilla/TBC. 
---
When about to get hit and vanish it will fail. If i remember correctly, they fixed this in late tbc or in wrath.. they fixed it that way vanish made you immune to damage for short time or something like that.
---
Is that so? watch the whole thing. The mage had this paladin sheeped and was going to make it into the city. I saw a mage running and killed him.
---
The players that reddit are a fraction of the population. The people that post whining complaint threads like they are some activist for the people are even smaller. The game is in great shape, there will be tons more groups that venture successfully into Naxx. 
---
My only concern currently is specific players/guilds hording black lotus/spawns that will make it impossible for less hardcore guilds like mine from realistically being able to flask when needed. Been leveling/farming with an alt in the zones that have BL for ~20 hours, have not seen a spawn. I suspect Blizzard is already thinking about it though and will attempt something to help balance it for the 1 layer population size.
---
Or form your own groups.  PuG's aren't the only option for grouping either.
---
Whitemane is complete cancer right now. I tried going to gadgetzan to train goblin engineering - nope, controlled by over 100 horde and insta camped as soon as you land. Tried going to DM as well. Camped from the boat all the way to the DM bottleneck before I gave up. There is only 1 lvl 60 instance I can get to relatively safely by taking a roundabout flight path but I’m not going to post it here
---
It's also a short flight to Hinterland and back.
---
It's kind of like the first time you play starcraft and learn about the zerg.
---
Isn’t the mage blade better?
---
This did exist in Vanilla under various names, a popular one being Paranoia. 
---
There are a number of reasons why this isn't "broken" but the main one is that all the information it provides is already visible to players without the add-on. 90% of the information can be viewed using the Combat Log, such as when someone enters stealth or casts a spell. You can already target players who are not visible to you. The only notable thing this add-on does is to make viewing this info more convenient. 
---
Everyone already has this "super power," those who aren't using it either don't know they have the ability or are too lazy to bother.
---
My first HK was against a mage 8 levels below me who I chased over half of stv.  The level at which mages can just get away from a fight against a warrior is staggering.  If pummel doesnt land against a poly or frost bolt its night night
---
Nope, I like the fact that allies outnumber us on my server. These little various imbalances are the x-factor that made vanilla so great. You can just transfer to a PvE server instead of wanting the clout of being on a PvP server but also not wanting any of the struggle that comes with it.
---
I don’t think pvp and pve servers will be in the same battlegroups
---
Im alliance. Im on heartseeker. Its actually super fun over here. Alot of servers had the option to transfer here. If ya didnt teansfer thats on you. If you chose pvp thats on you. Its not blizzards responsibility to change their release plan to appease you. They gave you multiple outs to get away from horde.dominated servers and you chose not to take them.
---
This is on you. Its the first week of pvp. Take a deep breath, go outside, watch a movie, come back in a week and 8t will calm down a bit. And a week after that it will be even better.
---
Also think it's hilarious with the whole "you think you want it, but you don't" thing and "NO CHANGES!!". People very clearly don't want this, they want to quit.
---
I love how that's the only compromise for you people.
---
Flamelash is all good. Rarely any queues and it’s slightly skewed to horde, maybe up to 60/40 but I wouldn’t think more.
---
You are willing to pay 520€ per month?! Crazy but I like it
---
Most ignored loading screen is the one about taking wow in moderation
---
One of the WoW podcasts I was listening to indicated they'd heard WSG was being considered for last Thursday. Assuming they heard this talk from a reliable source it seems likely WSG will drop soon.
---
It only makes sense, they packed the servers allowing no faction restrictions bottle necking any one leveling from Tanaris onward. Sure there are a couple places to level ok but its painful in particular with the imbalance in factions. We'll see but in the next couple weeks I expect we see at least WSG.
---
Well Naxx gear is a game changer.
---
We don't know at all. There was an unreliable census addon back in September that showed horde dominance pretty strong, and we haven't seen anything since then. I don't doubt Horde outnumber ally, but as a horde trying to level I get camped just like they do.
---
I think the biggest issue is folks don't know how the system works. Camping doesn't do anything other than troll (same as before) and being in big groups is terrible for you as well.
---
Same haha, happy cake day!
---
There's honestly no chance someone who has a regular job can get rank 14.
---
Incendious is another good EST server with rare queues and a decent balance.
---
on Patchwerk-EU it's exactly the same, just the other way around.  
---
it takes 30 mins an AT LEAST 10 deaths to enter brd/lbrs etc..  
---
groups and groups of hordes just run and stand around randomly in searing/burningsteppes
---
Then go play retail.
---
What's this UI? Mainly interested in the nameplates.
---
It also checks your mouse over too.
---
I definitely expected it. I do not know why y’all thought otherwise.
---
That or do the raid! Hahaha
---
This is why I’ve always been saying that everyone should roll need on BOE stuff, but got a lot of hate for it. 
---
It’s ultimately the only way to prevent ninjaing in this game.
---
No, they cared more about overall population of the servers rather than the faction ratios of the populations. Skeram went from a decent, slightly horde favored to being completely dominated by horde. We had transfers open for over a month on a server that was already favoring 1 side. As more left, it snowballed into others following. What should have happened was forced queues with specific faction transfers that tried to even out all the server populations. Of course, there should have been more servers from the very start so people were spread out more as well.
---
Man hes obviously talking about 237 players, not raids. For your info thats almost 6 raids.
---
People always say this like it has anything at all to do with whether or not the addon sucks. It fucking sucks no matter how long its been around, all that changed is that its more obvious now that it sucks.
---
below average? you mean worst class by a huge margin?
---
and they really arent that good at group pvp
---
once you have one mortal strike you dont need 2
---
a rogue brings so much more to the group than another warrior
---
Same here, havent gained more than 5000xp since thursday, and it's not because i havent tried to play. Its just that i cant.
---
So yeah, if transfer to pve opens up im using it. Else I might just quit if this continues, it's just not fun getting killed by a raid of people 10 levels above you.
---
They're called good players, or players who got tired of getting ganked.
---
-75% stats for 10 minutes
---
-25% durability
---
It already is a punishment
---
They can wait with bgs but allow free char transfers to a pve server of your choice. I picked a pvp server because most of my friends wanted that. Have some friends who plays on pve servers and would be fine to switch because the game is unplayable for me rn.
---
again, lets just make it so when you attack plate, you get 0 energy
---
the reason for the absorb issue back then wasnt intentional game design 
---
it was an oversight w/ how they coded rage generated from damage done
---
I had a tank go to undercity to go repair all of his gear...
---
These people and their hilarious arguments.  Holy shit.  
---
"I like wasting mine and everyone else's time."  
---
Seriously.  You like walking around and seeing the world?  Do it solo.  Don't do it grouped when people are wanting to run dungeons.  It's hilarious how people want everything so slow, yet I bet those same people can play for 10+ hours a day.  Even if not.  You want to see the world?  By all means.  Go see it.  Just don't need to do it on my dime.   
---
Yet their only response is "Go back to retail or warlock."  That's it.  No middle ground with these people.  They have ALL the time in the world, fuck anyone else.
---
You mean the game mechanic that existed from Vanilla through Cataclysm?
---
And it makes you more invested in sticking to that group. You're way less likely to bail on the first minor mistake because of how long it would take to put another group together. Adding conveniences like summoning stones begins to encourage the "wtf scrubs I'm out" mentality.
---
I’ve not asked them to change a single thing but acting like it’s not reasonable to be annoyed with how horrendously imbalanced the game is, is just stupid. 
---
You’ve assumed I’ve said and want a lot that’s not there at all. 
---
People have complaints. People are entitled to their opinions. Stop telling people to shut up because you disagree with them.
---
You're barking up the wrong tree buddy, I'd far prefer to be on the 30 side of a 30/70 split, but I'd prefer as close a 50/50 split as possible to either of those. Faction queues do that while also bringing servers closer to a reasonable overall pop.
---
its hilarious because these same people existed 15 years ago and its why blizzard effectively removed wpvp.  so why would you want to play classic anyway?  just go play retail the game blizzard made for you?
---
I feel like the biggest problem is the huge servers we have right now. World pvp is a bit... annoing when there's so many people that you can't take step in a 50+lvl zone without getting killed.
---
So many people in one zone is hardly authentic nochanges experience.
---
I've decided to quit playing until battlegrounds is released because PvE has become impossible. The ganking is not fun the game is not fun. When battlegrounds is released this cancer will be eliminated.
---
 *One by one...*
---
Yea the better strategy is to just be an adult and say "hey would you give me a bit of time to drink between pulls, thanks". Doesn't even need to be that much time, and no matter what it will always take less time than if there's a wipe due to a bad pull where the healer goes OOM
---
If they don't listen, just leave. Healers aren't the easiest to come by, if they won't listen that's their fault.
---
Did you not know that horde had better racials? Did you not know that horde was the more popular faction? Did you not know that playing alliance meant most likley being outnumbered? This is all very public info that has been available for literal years. This isnt on blizzard for releasing the game its on you for not knowing what eas coming.
---
I mean, this just wasn't my experience I guess. I ran scholo 59 to 60 and helped friends do it at 59, and we all hit 60 in about 3 hours (checking our /played), where as questing 56-57, 57-58 took us all around 4-6 hours per level, so even if questing efficiently is the best way - they're at least pretty similar.
---
Horde most represented in PvP and PvE, but alliance still somehow 75%?
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
1300 arena? I don't know what this means. I only play vanilla. The game went to shit when TBC came out.
---
what was EnemyGrid ?
---
Op is an idiot.
---
People generally sleep 8 hours a day. That’s a loss of 80$ a day at 10$/h. That’s 29,200$ a year loss doing literally nothing but staying still! If youd be smart like me you’d also be working 24hours a day. Nothing feels better than selling your life to a company that hates you.
---
Upvoting so more people can see how dumb op is.
---
Relying on an add on? No it's just easier than keeping a list of names and checking the name of every person you come across.
---
Karma doesn't exist so I keep a shitlist.
---
Imagine feeling elitist because you don't use an allowed feature of the game. #NotMyClassic
---
Ok but like...if you want these kinds of QoL changes you can go have them without screaming about changing Classic.
---
Blizzard forced you onto a server? Blizzard forced you not to transfer? Blizzard forced you to be on tbe lower pop faction? 
---
Thats all on you buddy.
---
And complaining for the sake of complaining, while claiming you dont want blizzard to change anything is whining. So either you are whining or when you said i assumed you wanted things to change you lied. 
---
Its not hard to grasp bud
---
Yes mageblade + offhand is objectively better stats wise than the staff, but more competition for the mageblade might make staff worth going for.
---
Honestly I see lots of posts/comments saying you shouldnt play right now during this update. But take this from someone who was your level. I started at 48 and did the entire Hinterlands zone quests last night and ended up at level 50. My buddy and I killed probly 20 allies in our level range throughout the night and only got killed twice ourselves.
---
It does work
---
Did you not know that you can’t have a game that’s all horde? Did you not understand that people can have multiple purposes and ave friends they play with? 
---
What a simple world you must live in since it’s all black and white.
---
Okay boomer
---
WPvp deathballs have never been fun.
---
Also, why would you think the same people are contradicting themselves? Reddit is full of different people
---
You just described world pvp in classic.  That's exactly how I described it before classic's launch, but people defended and glorified it.  World PvP was largely shit until the silithus gate opening event.  During that event, world pvp was fantastic in that zone.  I was MOSTLY a world pvp all through vanilla and nobody wanted to take my word for it until they actually played classic to see for themselves.
---
I also suspect, over the next few months, the hype will continue to die down as people begin to realize all of classic's other big flaws.  Jumping up on down on top of the bank because you have nothing to do between weekly raids being one of them, but so were BGs.  The honor grind was ass.  WSG and AB managed to be two of WoW's best BGs even now, but spamming the same two BGs all day against the same people gets stale, too.

It doesn't tell you where players are it just tells you when players are nearby. The only part i dislike is the stealth detection.
---
"Leveling needed to be completed".. pfff. Sorry this made me laugh.
---
So if I can't play 3 hours a day every day for 2.5 months because I simply can't, I shouldn't bother to play?
---
They're both ass holes. One charging way to much the other charging way to little
---
In my case from fireman to blood fang it took all of 10 minutes
---
If any of the previous discussion I've seen regarding Spy is true, then the ratio of people using Spy-like add-ons back then was extremely low, especially compared to how things are now. Also yes, I have only experienced vanilla before now through private servers, and I'm not afraid to admit that. If that lessens my opinion in your eyes then that's fine.
---
Well, they don't ban addons before they are made. That usually does come afterward.
---
Pvp servers are for people that want to gank.
---
BRD had tons of people on both sides standing outside of it and killing one another long before P2
---
I think this post is explaining how out of reach being top 15 would be, and how unrealistic it is for most. A hobby isnt something you dedicate 15+ hours to a day for months on end...
---
You sure? I saw a clip 2 days ago of a guy ganking someone, and mid combat is when he gets the alerts of all the 60s nearby. Then they show up in his field of vision, stroll up to him, and all bonk him down 100 to 0.
---
It's a negative feedback loop.
---
Even a perfectly balanced server becomes unbalanced.  And then it just snowballs.
---
You either have a dead server with little population anyways.  Or one of the factions being completely hollowed out by the other.
---
I mean, I think the biggest issue is people not expecting the insane server imbalance we are dealing with right now. Its just not fun to be so severely outnumbered all the time.
---
Actually funny you say that. I do know all of that which is why i rolled alliance and why im having fun despite everything i said being true. You have to accept that alli is less played amd that you will lose wpvp more than you will win
---
 You didnt.
---
Thats why you are mad. Because you didnt understand what you were getting into.
---
The problem here is that youre requiring some type of proof like if it was in the court of law. I can only give my own personal anecdotes. I was bullied in school and after ignoring them for so long i instead decided to stand up for myself one day. This ceased further bullying. Because I now knew how to handle bullies it helped me deal with a situation i had a year later when I was living in a rough neighborhood. Ive literally only thought about this now, almost 2 decades later, about how because I was caused some discomfort before, i avoided *great* discomfort later.  
---
The problem with this bs that people talk about, when they say "x community is so toxic", is that in reality you are receiving such a minor inconvinience since its mostly through text coming from a monitor in the safety of your own home, *then* acting like a bitch (or a baby, if you need to put it nicely) about it online.  
---
So if that meets your burden of proof or not now, honestly i dont care because nothing will change. People are going to feel slighted at the most minor of "insults" because theyve been comfortable their whole life and life isnt easy.
---
&gt; I just feel like this is a losing conversation for me
---
Well, if you look at a conversation as something that can be lost (or won), then yeah, this will be frustrating for both of us. I don't participate in arguments because I'd rather **discuss** and learn than **debate** and win (or lose). So consider my response here as discussion, not as argument.
---
&gt; you almost never sunder
---
Against a single opponent (like a boss), I actually constantly use Sunder Armor (when I have sufficient rage, up to 5 applications). SA is the best way to hold a single mob's hate. I'll also put SA on specific individuals in mob groups if those individuals are special in some way.
---
Against multiple opponents (of equal danger/power, like many of the trash encounters in Armory), I'll use Battle Shout and Demoralizing Shout to put at least some aggro on all the mobs (to counter the healer's threat spread to all the mobs). I also try Cleave when I could (when rage and memory combined). I now use Whirlwind, also, but at the time of this dungeon run, I think had just gotten that ability, and I wasn't practiced with it or stance dancing much to/from Berserker Stance.
---
The problem, though, comes when my teammates engage the mobs before I have generated sufficient rage and threat. If you don't see me putting SA on anything, check my rage level. Either I don't have at least 15 rage, or I'm choosing to use multi-threat (shouts or cleave) abilities because I'm trying to hold multiple mobs. Being rage starved usually (like often in this dungeon run) comes from my teammates targeting mobs I'm not directly targeting myself (like when I'm focusing the skull mob). If there are three mobs, and I start focusing on #1 -- attacking it directly, using cleaves, and throwing out shouts as I can -- but my teammates attack mob #2 and #3, well that screws things up badly.
---
I've had many good dungeon runs where teammates focus my target first, and don't stray to mobs with only tenuous aggro on me.
---
&gt; you blow rage on useless things like rend
---
Yep. This is a flaw I have only recently (after this dungeon run) managed to overcome. I've used Rend as my first hit (after charge) while questing over 40+ levels, so it is sadly pretty much a habitual thing, now. But I'm pretty confident that I've now (since level ~40) broken this habit while tanking. We'll see in future videos, I guess.
---
&gt; your reactions times are really slow
---
Guilty as charged. I'm 52 years old. I'm lucky I can still drive safely :-D (I pretend my reactions were faster when I was young, but that's probably not true.)
---
&gt; you aren't stance dancing which means you arent generating rage from charge or bers rage or switching out weapons to help you keep agro
---
I have recently (again, since around level ~40) figured out stance dancing. I've set up macros for it and everything. But at the time of this dungeon run, I was not at all practiced in it.
---
Switching weapons: I have macros for it, now, but I still rarely actually switch weapons in the middle of battle. But maybe since I am stance dancing more/better/at all, now, weapon switches aren't as necessary? [Although, I have to admit I don't really like often switching weapons in the middle of a fight just for fantasy aesthetic reasons. I know this is a game, but still, it feels wrong.]
---
&gt; using stance dependent ae like clap and ww
---
Again, I wasn't practiced in stance dancing at the time of this dungeon run. I think I am better now, and I do **now** (eventually) switch to use Thunderclap and Whirlwind.
---
&gt; I only bring this stuff up because you seem to be implying that the problem was the other people.
---
I'd say the problem was just one person. Only the other warrior (one person) was directly causing me frustration by *actively* doing stuff that hindered my tanking -- charging in and taking aggro before I (the designated tank) could establish a hold. He could have tanked himself if he wanted to do that -- he was 2 levels higher than me.
---
The melee shaman was also taking some aggro from me, but I think that was more due to him being 4 levels higher than me (and than most of the mobs). When you're 4+ levels higher than the tank, you have to be aware that you may easily overpower his threat generation. But at least that is not actively *taking* threat on purpose (like charging in before/during the pull).
---
If the team lets the tank build threat before they start engaging, the fight is always smoother. And if someone does accidentally pull aggro off the tank, it's not a big problem for the tank to get it back quickly. 
---
Note: Having said all the above, I don't claim to be perfect. I may *know* what I'm supposed to do, but sometimes, I fail to *do* what I'm supposed to do. I'll say, "Have mercy on me, I'm just an old man." But what is probably more true is that I'm just bad at video games (and probably have been for 40 years). But being bad in practice doesn't mean I can't recognize when someone else is playing poorly. I may suck in practice, but I can also recognize suck when I see it :-o
---
On the few occasions that I've played DPS warrior in a dungeon run, I always give the warrior tank time to gather threat before I charge in. And I act as off tank -- Taunting mobs off the non-tanks -- as a courtesy to help the tank and team. I **do not** actively pull mobs from the tank -- the healer shouldn't have to split his/her attention between two tanks.
---
? blizzard is the only entity that controls the online player cap.
---
The problem is the servers having up to 10x the populations of canilla servers, primarily. 
---
The second problem is people trying to minmax their honor - the days of sick 1 on 1 pvp videos between two high ranked players, which is what people think of when they hear 'world pvp,' are long gone.
---
Server lag doesn't help either.
---
Honestly wasn't that much to poke fun at other than a few personal mistakes and some sloppy bosskills. I took out like 4 parts that I found hilarious simple mistakes that some of them made and just did something with that.
---
Litteraly every Reddit post and Youtube video were like : "Everyone who isn't lvl 60 by Phase 2 will have a hard time on pvp server"
---
People not level 60 and getting ganked endlessly in phase 2 : "Insert Pikachu surprised face meme"
---
I've never been able to wrap my head around why the horde, especially taurens, are cool with undead allies.
---
Very few people knew about it or used it, dumbass.
---
I would not, spam some UBRS, get your 100% mount, then see whether you want to go Krol
---
You can’t even fucking play the game dude, it’s BROKEN.
---
I already answered, here I'll repeat it for you to help you out. Don't bother replying though, I've not got the time to deal with how oblivious you are:
---
Kill on sight list.
---
Try being less pedantic and realize I was adding to the discussion.
---
Horde are screwing themselves by camping FPs and the like.
---
&gt;if you have a different opinion go away.  I’ll die without forcing myself in your conversation.
---
I'm sure I'll be down voted to hell since this sub is PvP Elitist only but..
---
I don't mind people guarding dungeons. Defend it off and keep people out, cool whatever. Have your large scale battles over by SS and TM, if I want to do that I'll go over. You want to camp a FP for your honerless kills, so be it, I'll go to my nearest city FP and walk to where I need to go. I'm mining thorium and you want to fight me for it, be my guest. None of these aspects of PvP bother me. What bothers me is the 20 man raid group corpse camping me(yes 1 guy so a 20v1) while I'm in a remote corner of somewhere killing mobs, or when I jump on an ult and a ganking raid of at least 10+ levels higher decides to corpse camp me while I'm questing. I'm glad your getting your 4 honor per kill, congrats its well earned. But, basically until there isn't 20-40 man raid groups in every zone I'm going to hop on for raids until my subscription expires and then I can leave the toxic gameplay to the toxic people.
---
Hm? Don’t you just jump into the lava?
---
The problem is from having such big servers to begin with. 
---
At least faction specific ques would deter the servers getting more unbalanced.
---
Good answer!
---
Why would you not expect as much from the most incompetent AAA developer of the past decade?
---
Yeah it feels very different this go around from Vanilla. I don't fully remember it that well, but back then it felt like everyone was kind of derping around in blue gear and random specs for the most part besides a handful of people in really hardcore guilds.
---
Now you have a sizable chunk of the population with epics and organized guilds on discord steamrolling everyone else who is just now running through BRD for blues. 
---
And there's a pretty huge difference between dungeon blues and raiding epic gear. For example most of the pre-raid BIS gear for casters will have two of three: stamina, int/spirit, and +dmg/heal. But NOT all 3. So you end up getting two shot by anyone in raid gear.
---
It's meant to simulate a warzone so... yeah. Hillsbrad for example is meant to be the opening skirmishes of a full on Forsaken invasion. If you only want to be killed by people of your level then roll PvE and you can still flag yourself for PvP when you want to engage in it but avoid being ganked.
---
Lol you kids and calling ppl toxic. It's the new gaming buzzword
---
I feel like the horde is way less organized but will have huge zergs of randoms steamrolling everything. Alliance will have 3 organized raids coordinating together and never die but they are the only group on alliance side doing it
---
I play both.
---
Sheep, detect magic, wait for honorless Target to fall off, kill.
---
2:1 isn’t bad at all. It could be so much worse
---
&gt; Kill on sight list.
---
Sticky note and pen. I aint buying it. Uninstall spy.
---
Arrogance.
---
I am playing retail, and also classic.  Is that not allowed?
---
It honestly blows my mind that Blizzard won't break spy. It's very obviously an abuse of the system. People like to say "but it's only using info you're given" and to that I say "then why do you even need spy, if it's that easy to use without it?".
---
Seriously, it needs to be broken. I think Spy is way more damaging to the game than an LFG addon
---
I'm with you, I say instead of boycotting it, we all use it. The more it's used the more attention it gets the more blizzard will be faced to do something about it
---
Yikes. Sorry I didn't come in here gushing about how awesome your guild is. Obviously that's all you're looking for.
---
Once again: None of this is progression, none of this is ground-breaking, you are literally doing something that millions upon millions of players have already done for years. Slowclap.
---
Here's the humble brag post about how incredible this guild is because they did a raid quickly.
---
Why do you not understand you rolled on a pvp server? You people always find something to bitch about. 
---
Outrage and victim culture is very real.
---
that's a pretty consistent Blizzard move
---
&gt;players ask for something
---
&gt;Blizzard implements it in a half-assed way that pisses off the people who both wanted AND didn't want it
---
&gt;"well, it turns out that players don't actually want [thing]"
---
LOL! This is the part where we look through eachother's profiles to attack eachother. So lame. I bet you're republican.
---
This is actually pretty funny. People were asking for BGs back in 2004-2005 for the same reasons you’re listing.
---
When we got them it took maybe like 6 months after that everyone hated them. Let’s see if that repeats itself too.
---
More then half of these arent melee specific consumables and a single flask already is worth more then 50g. IMHO melee have it way easier if they really want to min-max on consumables.
---
Take the staff so the paladins can have the sword
---
The number of times I’ve seen guild mates ask “who’s going to grind out Rank 14?” Is hilarious. No one dude. No one is going to grind out Rank 14 because it takes multiple people playing the same account 20 hours a day 7 days a week to get there.
---
Why would you pay 6 gold to go from brm to kargath, its so close.
---
I think they should ban horde random horde until its balanced. Its good for the game, deal with it.
---
Game is absolutely fucking broken. Back to retail it is
---
Fully agree. I was not expecting that.
---
It reminds me of the dota2 community clamoring for Techies to be released. Techies is a hero like the TF2 demoman -- he can stack a million bombs in one spot and essentially one shot anyone if he invests the time into planting those bombs. One can see how, in a PVP MOBA game, getting one shotted randomly from across the map could be frustrating. So many people were excited for him, but a good few of us knew that people would quickly change their tune after finally playing against it.
---
"You know not what you ask for"
---
Lol you are sooo lost bro. I hate retail due to the gear resets. It doesn't get any more casual than an mmo that gives out the top gear before each patch to catch people up.
---
All ruined because people like you need to "consume content" and blizzard wanted a BAD MECHANIC to make sure everyone can catch up to the new content.
---
Cant wait for people to start quitting, less people will make game better.
---
Idk why you had to come at me sideways with some edgy shit lmao all other vanilla players will tell you the same thing.
---
agree, totally bored on horde twink not able to find any 60 ally : - )
---
I agree, problem for me is, I dragged my wife onto a pvp server, and my other friend doesn’t play, now my wife is mad at me cuz she’s getting shit on lmao.  Take my money and let us leave blizz!!
---
New? That shit is 10+ years old now.
---
But yes, it's funny how it started and had an actual meaning. But now it's been reduced to a meme.
---
You're right, the world feels extremely alive while I am constantly dead
---
This isnt vanilla though. This is 15 years later on server much more densely packed than those servers in vanilla ever were. Thats why this argument doesnt work.  
---
Honestly it feels like Blizz is actively trying to make classic fail with these weird decisions they seem to keep making.
---
Both hero and glad here.  In terms of individual performance, arena&gt;rbgs by a fair margin.
---
Just hope they don't bring BG's until after the new year. I have too much stuff going on in my life around Christmas time to be stuck in BG's trying to honor farm. My family would disown me if I had to cancel plans because I was trying to rank up for pixel loots.
---
small scale?^^ just curious in you on a low pop server?
---
I just respect for pvp and didn't get improved feign. It's probably needed to do this effeciently tho huh?
---
Hunters are easier. A mage that understands what they are doing are much faster
---
I mean there are still queues for a game that first came out 15 years ago and server crashes because of so many people doing PvP.... so yea?
---
It’s true though.
---
Ignored still show up on /who
---
Yeah I would say all the Bags should be unlocked let people play what they want. I always thought at least WSG will be there in this phase.
---
You have the mindset of someone who is weak. Guess that makes you weak.
---
Do you have a link to that poll?
---
big YES!
---
Your impatc is more limited in small scale combat? Wut?
---
In a 10 v 10 with people who want to fight, youre more limited because you cannot gank someone trying to go to an instance or talk to an npc? The only way your influence in a battle is lessened because its smaller scale is because you cannot fight a fair fight
---
Upvote for “suckle on some dickhole’s streamed teat.” Hahahaha
---
I really think WSG might cause it's so accessible.
---
Scarlet Kris (boe) and the +dagger dagger from dm:w are simming 12 dps higher than sword of zeal/mirahs for me on the new rogue spreadsheet.
---
Scarlet Kris is also way cheaper than sword of zeal on my server, so it might be worth a shot.
---
So is the sash better for raiding, except encounters where FR is an issue like Rag?
---
I mean hillsbrad v tarren Mill is an aoe fest... So avoid that toxic place.
---
Head to winterspring, plaguelands or your favorite farming spot. You are bound to run into small groups, compete for resources, stand your ground. True world PvP is a hell of a lot of fun, and rewarding to boot.
---
comparing spy to cs wall hacking.  my sides.
---
Honestly it doesn't though, drain soul is 55 Mana cheap enough to toss onto the end of a mob even if your drain tanking. It doesn't really matter if you clip a few seconds of the 5 second rule because the talent allows 50% Mana Regen even when while casting. There's a reason every warlock guide tells you to take imp drain soul and make a soul shard destroying drain soul macro. So drain tank, end with drain soul and tap away and you will always end up ahead of where you would be if you just drain tanked and tapped.
---
Literally the majority of good world PvPers played with their combat logs enlarged and/or highlighted when certain things appeared. It was and is very common because of how powerful it is. 
---
Spy does everything your combat log does but makes it more convenient to see. The same way Auction House add-ons make price values more convenient. The same way DBM makes PvE info more convenient.
---
Spy doesn’t give your location just that you’re nearby. If you’re in the only building for 100 yards then it makes sense that they’d check it first
---
Uber is cooler.
---
None, that's part of the problem. We talk about server population, while all the data we have is incredibly flawed
---
But this subreddit cried and cried about the early Dire Maul though....
---
Out of your mind.
---
Yes, Alliance may be camping here and there during isolated occasions. But only until a larger horde group comes in.
---
SS has been occupied by 100+ horde constantly since p2 release, not TM.
---
Running to BRM yesterday at 5pm took 20! not a typo or exaggeration. 20! corpse runs for our warlock.
---
I landed in LHC this afternoon and tried to turn in 3 scales. Was killed 4 times in town. And a 5th when tryin to get away. I ended up stealth walking all the way to UD Strat entrance. Had to wait for a horde to open the gate and sprint/charge through to avoid being killed by 14+ at the entrance.
---
Every upper level instance entrance is being camped by horde: DM, BRM, Strat, and even ZF.
---
The comment this morning in Wetlands was “wow, no horde at MH FP”.
---
Guarded must be made elite with larger aggro radiuses. Towns should at least be safe against 5-10 horde. But then we still have the instance farming issue.
---
As someone who likes PvP, BGs can’t come soon enough for Skeram.
---
The only bug would be if you havent done the quest and can get her loot. I think you might be able to see it but you shouldn't be able to get anything.
---
 It's intended you save her before you loot her, what you're describing is working as intended my guy
---
One event in Highmountain showed us there is [a very good reason they don't want us to take candle.](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=100495/devouring-darkness)
---
Blizzard can make a ton of money with realm transfers. I could definitely see them doing this.
---
wpvp in phase 1 is what everyone was thinking of when they say "I love wpvp". This wpvp in phase 2 is not wpvp at all and yes, Blizz is to blame because all that was needed was honor and bgs implemented from the start, not slowly rolled out for unknown reasons.
---
That's not average, that's median. Median is value exactly in the middle between all the values, average can easily be pulled up or down by extremes. For example, if you have 10 people making 10k$, and one person making 1M$, the average is 100k$ even though only a single person is above that average.
---
Lol this is literally them
---
I'm a new player. I just know from playing Runescape and OSRS that some changes were necessary for the game, it's just the changes they made the first time around weren't optimal.
---
fuck the casual noobs, wow is a war game. go play league of legends if u want fair fights
---
Every Alliance char of mine that makes it high enough to visit booty bay (which, to be fair, aren't all that many) has this happen to them at least once, because no matter how much I try to remember it, there's always at least one moment where I go brain-afk and head to the flightmaster I'm used to :/
---
A huge reason why it took hours was that premade base-racing wasn't a widespread strategy until very late in Vanilla and on private servers. Even if they reverted AV to a pre-nerf state you can't just un-invent that strategy.
---
I don't even Know how I got 5 HK
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dvegdg/the_prephase_2_rclassicwow_censussurvey_results/
---
Its not just streamer server. Most of the original NA PVP servers have nighly queues. Whitemane was over 2 hours the other night.
---
Queues will go away, and server crashes aren't a reason to stick around. Actually I don't know what planet you are from, but server crashes tend to make people *not* want to keep playing...
---
The idea of faction transfer is very interesting. I also like the idea of faction specific queues but what happens if overall pvp realm balance is like 65/35 (complete random guess I have no clue but it must be somewhat weighted towards the horde right?) so perhaps a faction transfer could help to solve this.
---
Blizzard beat Bethesda and EA when they announced Diablo Immortal and banned Blitzchung.
---
Uh oh, China bots are here to downvote.
---
seems like your rage generation game is pretty strong
---
I'm on run 87 while seeing one drop, that a paladin took over me a fury warrior
---
But the guy always needs to find two people who would accept to summon right ? 
---
So if no one is around this system does not work.
---
44 - 56% to horde.
---
Your server is one of the rarer balanced ones and you still play the more populated side, ofcourse its not that bad for you.
---
Your situation is not at all the same as it is for someone with situation like Stalagg alliance or heartseeker horde.
---
summoning stones take away A LOT of the challenge of the game. Blizz has slowly been catering to the casuals. you are a casual if you don't agree.
---
I'm so sad that they decided to jump right into cross-server BGs. That's what killed the fun for me in vanilla.
---
this 100%, questing is just not possible currently.  Maybe its going to die down soon, but it doesn't matter the zone, the time, the level.  You will get ganked questing within minutes, and you will die a dozen times gettin into a dungeon.   I currently can't turn quests in because the boats to the other continent are controlled by raids of horde.
---
I’m not gonna boycott spy lmao. That’s suicidal
---
dont play vanilla if u dont want vanilla
---
You messed up the order of your name
---
It never had a meaning. It was just Riot Games being pussies and siding with feeders instead of people mad at feeders
---
Dog, I have a level 60, as well. Guess what? It's still just as asinine and garbage at 60 as it is at 52. 
---
Also, stop using the word 'literally,' you have no idea what it means.
---
It’s not an argument. It’s just something he thinks is funny. No use getting all bent out of shape man.
---
Battle of the two noobs
---
Noone said full runs we said 60s run brd all the time. Of course they aren't doing full quest runs there 60...
---
Jamie, pull that shit up!
---
Which is why Blizzard should've acted on this sooner. They could have easily allowed signup on servers to factions based on maintaining a particular ratio. They could've had faction restrictions on transfers the first time around, after the first census data was already out. They could institute faction based queues and BG now.
---
Horde  
---
Warlock  
---
says enought : - )
---
This isn’t anything like vanilla. You’d know that if you played it.
---
Lol that's one out of 8 races.
---
retail
---
Add on that keeps track of items in mailboxes?
---
Skeram is 3:1 with even more players. Basically the number of people on the servers allows everything to be camped simultaneously. The vanilla server i played on was 2:1 but with fewer total players, it didnt feel as bad.
---
Didn't Icefrog publicly say he doesn't like Techies? Kind of a good analogy.
---
I did that quest. Feels bad man
---
Alts
---
Who's screaming about changing Classic?
---
The boots you you start with when you create a character cannot be enchanted.
---
Kill the target, they respawn half health and now worth honor and easy to kill.
---
I’ve seen people who fly in CC’ed with poly or priest MC until they are worth honor and then they are killed and camped
---
\#nochanges was a stupid stance that the sheep took, anyone who actually played and understands how vanilla works understands that #nochanges actually breaks Classic.
---
lately in elvui, i hit 'display frames' on raid40 and my entire ui just fucking disappears and i have to alt f4. why?!?!?
---
Lol I respect it, what’s your talents?
---
Stop the QQ you sound like a baby
---
Ah ok. That makes sense. Thank you
---
They used to call these things homes and dwellings.
---
You can't sap in combat. What kind of warrior will not be in berserker stance after charge? I'd like to see your 5 man group of 50s that will not break blind in 0.1 seconds.
---
lol right??  
---
Battlegrounds are stressful. They're about winning the game in the shortest amount of time and not about killing players. Casually joining an orgrimmar raid on a saturday is fun and chill.
---
Gnomes with frickin laser beams attached to their frickin heads
---
Yep, but the bigger HK count looks cooler until honor is actually calculated.
---
Wait until you get to a failable escort quest with someone who takes ages to walk somewhere. What added to the flavour of levelling was seeing the opposite faction, and immediately wondering whether they were hostile or not, some would attack, and some would leave you be, depending on how the player felt. That's what made it multiplayer. Now, when you see someone of the opposite faction, they may as well be a mob, you kill them, and a number goes up, or they kill you, and their number goes up. This, if it's not curbed in a serious, and severe manner, will end up with the game haemorrhaging subs. I'd personally say that they should make it so that a level 60 killing anyone below 60 is a dishonourable kill, but I'm not sure that's even gonna be successful.
---
The point isn't that there's PvP on a PvP server, it's that on some servers, the PvP mechanic is effectively broken.
---
I dont see how that would even correlate but I havent played retail in years.
---
&gt;Yea the better strategy is to just be an adult--
---
&gt;If they don't listen, just leave.
---
lmao you have a crazy definition of an adult.
---

Actually, it's the Tauren who most advocated for the Forsaken to be accepted. Specifically, it was Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem. He basically said, look guys, they're suffering, they're outcasts, this is what the Horde is about. They figured that the Horde was the best place for them while they worked to find peace, and maybe even a solution for their... "predicament".
---
I always took this as a mercy kind of thing. Like, yeah, they're undead and creepy and against the order, but need help, and maybe we can even cure them.
---
Spoiler, they were not cured, but I guess they found a kind of acceptance, which is the next best thing.
---
No, definitely no repair at least at Revered.
---
The problem I’m having is if I am in cat form outside and I hit my macro button to go to travel form I get a message that says you are in shape shift form instead of going back to travel form.  If I wanna go back in travel form I have to break cat form manually and then hit the macro button to go back to travel form. Is that how it isn’t tended to work?
---
There's absolutely nothing exciting about being ganked by 10 man squads everywhere I go.
---
Honor always does this
---
Target needs to be in front of you.
---
Youd think so but the amount of bad warlocks ive ran dungeons with and *the guy* im replying to literally telling me how to be a bad warlock is telling you otherwise.
---
PRINT.SCREEN. do you have that button?!
---
Did you report?
---
Yeah, next week people are going to see that they are rank 2. Then a month later rank 5. And it will only slow down from there.
---
WTF that's so toxic how can you say something like that??? I have three wives, eighteen kids, sixty grandkids, and I work four jobs full time as a vegan. I demand Blizzard waits for as long as it takes until I get level 60. I don't care about anyone else though.
---
Staggering number of complainers here.
---
Whaaaat ? So the guy is paying three subscriptions ?
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
This comment is libel. You are spreading blatantly false information about me. Pretty fucking pathetic.
---
Yeah in world PvP it’s personal, when I’m farming air elementals and a mage blows me up, and we kill each other for the next hour, that’s world PvP. I’m not doing it for honor points, I’m doing it because I want you dead. 
---
Sitting at flight paths with 10 people waiting for people to land and then camping their bodies isn’t personal, it’s about getting honor points.
---
Does his videos show the part where he has an alt hunter scouting round with eyes of the beast or something? This guy is a total nightmare to play on a server with. He has an almost complete monopoly on black lotus and obviously doesn’t work irl or do anything else than farm black lotus as he is online 24/7. 
---
Tl:dr Black lotus farming guide: play all day every day. Have Alts scouting multiple locations at once. Totally doable for average bro with a job, wife and 2 kids :eye roll:
---
Does that mean he is paying for three accounts ? :O
---
It was one of the first incentives towards dungeon party-churn and the general dissolution of server communities. Certainly not **the one** breaking change, but the first of many that followed (dungeon finder being another big one).
---
Yeah it was just like this, but with less density of players so a little more playable. Tons of ganking though.
---
Vanilla world pvp was at its best before honor
---
They all assume every single server is horde dominated.
---
You literally managed to say nothing.  It's impossible and stupid to force others not to min/max or be elite.  So the argument is correct and yours is wrong.
---
I’m quite interested in making a dagger rogue alt until this wPVP dies down a bit, I’d like to funnel it some good BoE green/blue weapons from my main.    
---
Do you need Daggers in both hands for things like backstab and ambush? And am I wanting a fast dagger in the offhand and a slow dagger in the main hand?
---
I was an absolute scrub in vanilla and I did that along with everyone I played with that wpvped
---
if an unexpected pat rolls up on you, you weren't paying attention or really shouldn't be overextending on a dungeon you're unfamiliar with. I do exactly this even as a shadow priest, it allows me to maximize my mana drinking time while also being able to react immediately.
---
Cept that the portal is camped too, so I can't even summon people to instance without getting killed before I even load in.
---
That the joke, ones irrational and the other is just confused because they’ve listed there’s at market price lol
---
except this is a video game and real people died during those other events...
---
Hope you've changed the discord invite link for your guild that is shown around 5 minutes.
---
already there
---
I just can't take horde seriously right now, talking tough from the safety of their numbers. Even though wpvp isn't supposed to be about fairness you sound silly to me
---
that is not default reddit behaviour, you have to click to open them.
---
so, get rid of whatever addon you have that does it.
---
I don't know why you are so mad over this. It's not my fault you are bad at pvp and can't handle it. I know what litteraly mean and yes litteraly every single post about phase 2 had reference to the horrible experience leveling will be for lower level.  Punkrat, Madseason, Kargoz, Tipsout and other popular WoW Classic content creator were all urging their audience to reach 60 before Phase 2 release. Honor system with no BG with hundred of people stacking grenades and leveling engineering to have free honor from boomer like you playing alliances.
---
It's not that I'm defending current World PvP, it's just this is exactly what anyone should have expected in regards to Classic World PvP, and the solutions presented are fucking awful.
---
As much as I'd love to have a BG released early, I'm enjoying World PvP and am finding plenty of 1v1s or 3v3s out in the open with my friends. Sometimes I find myself in a hoard of 10 ganking 1, sometimes I'm getting ganked by 15, it doesn't really matter either way.
---
Not everyone is saying "give us battlegrounds".  I for one don't want them yet.  You're looking at a small sample size.  What most people think they want though is faction spec queues.
---
The people that were excited about world PvP are still excited. The people that were going to cry about dying and beg for battlegrounds are a different crowd.
---
This sounds like Fairbanks!
---
If we are on after 8am, it usually takes about 30-40 minutes just to get into BRM. Usually because you're moving 15 yards at a time between deaths (only cause you can res away from your body)
---
Use leatrix maps and it shows where the dungeons and flight paths are
---
At 30 you'll get Feign Death. Make a macro that casts Feign Death (to drop combat) and then Freezing Trap.
---
schocking right? :P
---
lol greeding with strangers
---
My hearth is set to Menethil Harbor. Logged i to Horde trying to push up the docks. Fought a bit, then left once they were all purged out. Flew to Burning Steppes to check for Deathmaw, three rogues camping the Alliance FP. Hopped the FP to Redridge before they could kill me, ran over to check for the wolf then hearthed back. Surprise! Horde were attacking Menethil again. Sigh. Headed to WPL to turn in a quick quest. Surprise! Group of 6 Horde at the quest giver. I turn the quest in and die. Ress to an Alliance gank group clearing people out and head back over to Chillwind to wait for my fiance to log in. I die to yet another Horde gank group, help push them out then stealth just in time as a Horde raid rolls up. They all pass by me except for one Druid that directly walks over me. She attacks, we fight, the whole raid group comes back and kills me. They start camping Chillwind.  
---
I ress, log and switch to an alt for the night.  
---
Yeah, I'd like to go back to only encountering a few gank groups my entire time leveling and the back and forth of Horde/Alliance controlling questing hubs in smaller numbers instead of these massive gank groups steamrolling everything and killing Flight Masters. PvP before Phase 2 was fun where there was an ebb and flow to it with the group numbers being 2-10 and all random questers. Organic WPvP is fun where you pick and choose if you're going to quest side by side quietly, or kill one another to see if it sparks a small skirmish or not. Now all I'm coming across are coordinated Guild groups  of 10+ in raid gear, which is just boring and frustrating.
---
they are actually stronger in all other pve aspects, so no..
---
no, it didn't
---
Isn't invisibility supposed to be undetectable by proximity (without warlock buff)?
---
I walk into these mines like Anakin into the Jedi hall
---
Almost noone used paranoia in vanilla, it wasn't as widespread of a problem then. It also didn't have the same functionality as spy does today.
---
To your other point you technically can but it changes the process of doing it so much that you can't compare the two. During combat with another player you wouldn't have time to look at your combat log. Even if you did you wouldn't be able to run around and type /tar &lt;name&gt; over and over in the same way you click their name on the list. Not to mention you'd need to keep a written list of the peoples names that appeared in your combat log and you wouldn't know what class they were. To say this is the same process is honestly absurd.
---
It's the same thing in a lot of games where when people have something broken they don't want it to change because it provides them an advantage. I've seen it with changes in other games like old school runescape and it's just so painfully obvious in this situation. If someone has a compelling argument why it should stay I'm open to changing my mind.
---
&gt;"But that would take development resources, and classic can't have that apparently!"
---
...he says, after like 10+ hotfixes and bug patches so far
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
No, it was a meaningful description for "people whose negativity induces negativity in others". 
---
Guessing you're probably a pretty toxic person too.
---
The point is you shouldn’t be able to tell someone is in a building from 100 yards away without getting close to it and checking.
---
CharacterNotes is what I use.
---
It's nothing server wide but it's for personal use. You can leave positive or negative feedback on a player based on your experiences and any time they appear in chat it puts "note" next to their name you can click to read. Note will be green for positive reviews and red for negative reviews. Only you can see the notes
---
&gt; It's just deathballs and FP camping, nothing interesting is actually happening.
---
That is WPvP though.
---
You thought wPvP will be always balanced, fair, 1v1 fights where both parties are on the same ground? Lol
---
Didn't know. Thank you - I'll look into that ;)
---
You realize that if all the alliance leave, you’re essentially on a PvE server, right? 
---
Your thinking is very short sighted
---
Stay strong, Horde brothers!
---
Much more probably. If he has 2 dudes set up at each of these locations..
---
I think it will die down. Right now it’s world pvp hype town. 
---
Everything is kill on sight. 60s running around causing chaos because they have nothing better to do. It is fucking frustrating. 
---
It will change but I think for the next few weeks it’ll be a struggle. 
---
I don’t think it’ll make heaps people leave the game either.
---
There are plenty of places you can grind mobs in relative peace too if you really wanted to.
---
Ah, I see. I have different shapeshifting macros in cat, bear and caster form, so I never really came across that problem.
---
Try adding a `/cancelform` line.
---
no it really isn't.
---
People knew exactly what they asked for with Techies, but it was more of a schadenfreude thing. Turns out Techies infested their games as well, and when a bully gets bullied back it's no longer fun.
---
Amen.
---
I rolled a PvE server because I've seen on warmane what a high pop legit 15k players online at the same time pvp server looks like. I'm sure we're not far away from Blizz releasing BGs earlier like they did with DM. Absolutely no regrets with my server choice although I'm not getting the "real classic experience" according to this sub pre-release.
---
To all the people quitting because they "rolled the wrong server" Know the rules were laid out ahead of time. You chose to roll on that server.
---
At every location no?
---
How do you fight against dot based characters? Shadow priest, warlock etc
---
If you don't have a lock, oh well. When you have summoning stones, people solely rely on them. People should take the initiative and head there before group is full. Not doing mining in winterspring while hearth is on CD and in an ubrs group
---
Didn’t have Reddit logged my computer I browse only on my phone.
---
Lol no it's not. What did you expect a pvp server to be? Quit your whinging.
---
God these vanilla sycophants are insufferable. I am beginning to wish that phase 2 ends up burning like the dumpster fire that it is, and people leave the game in droves. Then these whinging purists will cry to kingdom come about how their beloved game was "just too hard, because of the libralllls! Librals are babies, and they couldn't hack it in a REAL MAN'S GAME!"
---
Heartseeker has 13249 alliance characters  in stark contrast to 5249 horde characters. Of characters that's above lvl 49 and has played within the last 21 days, there's 6308 alliance characters and 1878 horde ones.(According to http://wowpop.appspot.com/ , which wowhead uses as a reference for population numbers.)  You say you have a good time there as an Alliance, and say to the other guy he just chose wrong type of server, cus he doesn't want to be in the minority faction and never get to quest or instance without huge hassles. 
---
~~Are you blind to what this thread is even saying? Because we could prob screenshot your comment and put it in as the icon for this post.~~  E: Sorry for this line, it doesn't add anything to the discussion.
---
Ya pretty much this. If 80% of the population wants to roll horde then there needs to be ways to balance that. Or have horde the abilities to pvp alongside alliance to make open world pvp more balanced. 
---
On smolderweb I swear it’s minimum 8 deaths to enter lbrs ubrs or BRD. God forbid it’s a Tuesday. Holy shit Tuesday’s are the worst. 
---
Everyone wants to try hard for pvp and roll horde and then what’s really challenging about 3v1s. Or worse from my experience it’s a raid group picking off single players.
---
I think people use the term dead a bit to liberally
---
Thanks. If I understand correctly, then I can get honor for example by wanding a player once and then fearing them into a huge group of mobs which finish them?
---
Thanks for the response should I put that wine at the end?
---
Sure as shit wasn't my vanilla PvP experience. You'd get raids on occasion going after specific towns and getting push back, but these roaming raid gank squads wasn't really a thing.
---
People told me I'd be lucky to find groups as a shadow priest let alone raid. So far, I've raided the past 6-7 weeks pulling top 10+ on damage in MC with on 90% pre-raid bis and no raid gear. 
---
Our other shadow priest got Anathema and he was top DPS on Ony past week.
---
Basically, many of these mentalities came from private servers than wanted to min/max given many private servers were tuned much harder.
---
That implies all PvP is griefing, which isn't the case. You can like PvP and dislike being camped by 10 people for half an hour
---
Thats how long it took our raid just to get to the entrance this week
---
It’s automated when you press the macro?
---
It does.
---
Go outside you fucking obese vampire.
---
Daggerspine EU or US? I’m originally from Daggerspine US.
---
i think you lost meaning of this topic somewhere so i will end it here
---
Ya this is my thought on this which is why I rolled alliance and I’m at a huge disadvantage imo as I rolled Druid. Horde Druids are way better imo then alliance but I wanted better que times.
---
Imagine this is you...

---
Good for ranged pulling as a prot paladin. I could use grenades. But those candles have the nice smell of purged Kobolds on them.
---
Prioritize your job and try to resist the fomo. That's all there is to it. 
---
In 1-2 years it won't matter anyways. 
---
Why not just take things at your own pace with your 5-6h a week instead of just 'give up and quit'?
---
Losing 0/5 bot induces negativity in others too
---
Server I’m on is 3:1 alliance dominated
---
Minority?
---
Worked great last night for my guild. 
---
Horde arent really focused on the back entrance to BRM. You might find like 10-15 camping near the chain but a 40 man raid will shit on them.
---
Noggenfogger player here. Yeah its pretty aids. I have to spend several gold everyday to avoid being corpse camped.
---
Level an alt? not a chance you get ganked everywhere. I even tried to farm mara on my priest, got jumped by 3 different groups.
---
Well, hordes are ruining for themself on this server, they will get tired of camping different locations where no one is showing up. There will not be enough people to kill eventually to rank.
---
The only time of the day you can actually play as alliance is at night.
---
pretty much.. When they all want to be the best guild on the server then they know who do dodge.. :P
---
Fuck my guild spends this long before each fight explaining the same fight to the same people week after week.
---
Alright. You probably don’t catch what I’m saying then. 
---
After Classic was announced, people were super adamant about Blizz making it as close to the original WoW as possible. Every change was met with hate (I don’t know if you were here during the layering shitstorm this summer, but that is a prime example).
---
When they are releasing content in a progression similar to what they did originally (Honour system with ranks came a while before BGs were introduced), somewhat catering to the «no changes-crowd» (even tho Blizzard themselves never said there wouldn’t be changes) people still aren’t happy.
---
&gt;Tragedy plus time equals comedy - Steve Allen

You could say the same for tragedy and emotional distance really.

---
Fuck man I loved Techies back in DotA 1. Survived a 3 hour game 2v5 with Techies and Sniper, which shows just how broken he was haha
---
Hinterlands is super close
---
Why yes, inting is also toxic. People who play poorly are quite literally not "inting", since "inting" means "**intentionally** feeding". No one is defending this.
---
People who get beat legitimately don't deserve your impotent internet raging. Don't defend being an asshole lol
---
The majority of the big fixes are just exploits people found. There is still a massive list of bugs that haven't been fixed. Maybe someday vanish will work and energy ticks won't be bugged.
---
It's one of the server blades that held the server 15 years ago. Blizzard auctioned them off for charity a few years ago.
---
Blizzard just needs to allow paid transfers to PVE realms. Regardless of whether or not the PVP situation can be fixed I think a lot of players regret choosing a PVP server- even during phase 1.
---
&gt; once bgs are out prepare to see no one and interact with no dynamic experiences.
---
I dunno, there was still a pretty decent amount of world pvp in phase 1 before honor was introduced. After BGs are released, all the tryhard hk farmers will start doing those instead, and world pvp will be done by those who actually enjoy it.
---
Iam a level 50 hunter. Where do i level? This is so tideous. i dont know what to do anymore
---
the part where you compared real casualties to virtual life casualties? haha hilarious
---
Stock rogue stealth is a 10 second cool down aswell.
---
found the horde
---
Only merit I see in stream is to see if a game looks like fun to play
---
As far as population goes, Pagle is your best bet for Alliance PVE right now. I just rolled my new team there and it's okay so far but I've not gotten past newbie zones yet; [http://ironforge.pro/servers/](http://ironforge.pro/servers/) is a good measure of active 60s on each server if you want to consult that.
---
So that is an old server thing that used to be the home of the daggerspine server. Pretty sure blizzard auctioned all the old servers off for charity (could be wrong) after upgrading their hardware.
---
They may likely have four accounts, one for their main and Barker, then three with lots of alts in all the different locations.
---
Gotta be a hassle restocking shards tho
---
Yes it is
---
Hey thanks! I used to really be into Eve Online myself until I realised I really wasn't accomplishing anything in life.
---
No horde drink vender in ashenvale either.
---
Find any bots with Asian names? That's all I seen leveling there on thunderfury
---
Well that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
Yeah, faction imbalance has always existed. But server transfers after 2 weeks of the game being out hasn't.
---
The server that were previously (maybe) 55:45, are now 70:30 (or worse) due to Blizzard allowing people to transfer after the second week without taking imbalance into the equation.
---
Sounds like the most practical way to go about it.
---
says paladin special needs faction LOL
---
They like their *idealized fantasy* of world pvp, which are essentially duels with the opposite faction in the open world.
---
Which has the obvious issue of it almost never being the case.
---
Says the Hordie playing on a 70% Horde dominated server. I'm a rogue so I can avoid you guys but don't be surprised if half the alliance quit and you are stuck with 3 hour WSG que times.
---
so your mad that because people are now better at the game the situation is not exactly 100% the way it was in 2004?? your mad that people got to 60 faster? 
---
if only there was some way of predicting this, if only people expected phase 2 to be a shitshow at launch for people in the underrepresented faction. 
---
Man this is insane that people are actually this fucking upset becasue they want people to be as bad as they were in 2004. this is ludicrous of course phase 2 was going to be like this, we all knew. and you have the choice of pvp or pve servers and im sure they will give you an out soon with transfers.
---
If you didnt want the risk of being on the underpopulated faction then you shouldnt ahve played pvp alliance, on every launch server it was always going to be horde majority. everyone knew this.
---
Well once everythings done you either just raid log (log on only to raid), farm gold or level alts... 
---
I will likely be doing the last part of this, mainly once Im fully set...
---
Only mainhand needs to be a dagger, yes fast offhand, slow mainhand
---
I'm absolutely fine with that when the other option is faction queues. I'll have bgs soon to get my pvpitch.
---
I actually play a Troll! How did you know? English is my second language, mon. So maybe you go pick up another language than American and you show me how it's done? 
---
Also... Since when does orthograph &amp; understanding the meaning of a word are related? Nvm don't answer that. The answer will most likely be stupid.
---
You say "20h posts" like if it was a year ago... 20h isn't old news boomer.  Maybe you are better off going back to retail so you can get these easy reward to make you feel better about losing every single pvp encounter you get.
---
I feel like you are either a Troll yourself or very very simple
---
Either way boomer.  Reroll Alliance on a PVE server because PVP obviously doesn't suit you.
---
*open the ga-* **OPEN THE GAAAATE**
---
What's the difference? In both cases you're restricting loot competition.
---
So their poll from 25 people is supposed to be representative of the million+ players that were active in Vanilla?
---
i agree that comedy sheds light on dark matters, but taking a shot at our vets is a low blow imho
---
pretty sure everybody has seen this. But thanks for reminding me, i need to watch it one more time. It powers me through my level to 60 journey
---
I mean.. it was like that in 2005 as well. People probably did cry then as well but we were too busy shitstomping others to read the forums. This is only applicable to people rank12 and higher, who most likely are in the premade.
---
For your first point, I think it really depends on three essential criteria.
---
- Is your guild okay with you using buff slots? 
---
- Are the fights/raids short enough that you can sustain Regrowth spec without massive downtime?
---
- Is the druid dedicated enough to blast mana pots and runes like candy?
---
If the answer to all of these is yes, then I think Regrowth spec is a lot of fun. It allows resto druid to flex and is genuinely a good raid heal spec with intelligent downranking and enough gear and consumables to support it. Self innervate should almost always be required if you play this spec.
---
For your second point, this is kind of stepping into the unknown as all my experiences come from private servers with different fights and no real buff cap limitation.
---
I think for most guilds that are simply clearing raids and not aiming to blast through it, two druids is fine and even preferred for alliance (abolish is pretty cool in AQ onwards) and Priests in particular become the best healers in the game with 8/8 transcendence so you can throw them innervates instead.
---
For the ultra elite raids, you'll likely still be stuck with one moonglow HT spamming druid with no HoTs allowed, and you justify your raid slot purely off the back of Faerie Fire and very little else.
---
That is, if you bring a resto spec at all.
---
I certainly hope so.
---
When was it decided we get cross-realm BG’s for classic??
---
People have been playing Vanilla for 10+ years on various private realms. Some people are into this kind of thing, some people aren't. :)
---
I guess I am cause I dont want blizzard to change how the game works cause i'm salty as fuck over pvp. 
---
Keep getting farmed on your server friend, i'm having a blast on mine :)
---
Wait, what?
---
Didn’t have Reddit logged my computer I browse only on my phone
---
He's so much easier to find/see than the alliance flight path too.
---
Strange, mageblade is usually highly competitive between mages if nothing else.
---
The ones in WPL do. Bulwark for Horde, Chillwind for Alliance. The EPL quartermaster at Light's Hope doesn't because of.. reasons?
---
No it didn't. People were much more progression and exploration oriented. You would run dungeons with your guild just because. They weren't a method to an end. The economy was a lot tighter with no more than one instance of a resource being present at a time. 
---
Now in classic people had a checklist of things to do and acquire, and for the most part you could be done in a few weeks time. You would still have people orienting themselves, trying to figure out whether they liked their class et cetera around this time vanilla.
---
Classic has already been figured out, all the phases do now is gate progression. The result is people who completed their pre-raid BiS lists with gold to spare, and are left with the next most efficient thing to do for progression.
---
Plus what you also have right now is a level of player organization that just wasn't possible at the time. There weren't any streamers, gaming wasn't a career. Organizing 40 players for raiding was a logistical nightmare. Now between social media, discord, streamer followings etc, activities are much more centralized than what they were before.
---
Youre right, but life circumstances aren't going to cause someone to quit forever, usually for just a while
---
&gt; I'm planning on just buying ports to wherever I need to go for a while.
---
Not exactly a useful plan, considering mages can only port to the capital cities. And you can fly to those easily enough in most cases.
---
Or did you mean Warlock summons? Also not really workable unless summoning to a capital city, because if your faction is constantly camped by the other, there will be little chance of being able to complete the summoning ritual. 
---
I’m a warlock and the first day made some gold summoning a raid group to IF, but since each summon is a soul shard and I need to be able to kill enemies that give XP or honor, and I can’t go out and make those kills, I can’t sell summons even when people are offering a lot of gold, because I would run out of shards.
---
Couldn't have said it better. And yet many people will simply refuse to admit. 
---
"yOu sHoUld'Ve jOiNeD PvE rEaLm"
---
&gt;but it’s not like you’re dying literally the moment you rez
---
You must be playing on a low pop server
---
Never forget real life should come first, if anything maybe it will be a blessing as you have said you have good gear and without battlegrounds or a dedicated pvp guild doing wpvp you can always come chill in Azeroth whenever you can.
---
Despite the optimal min max culture we have now people are gonna be making fresh characters in the months to come and things change for others as it has for You. I started playing in vanilla when I was a teenager and warsong gulch had just been launched and was somehow able to have a ton of fun despite being way behind and gearing and specking cluelessly.
---
So if some PvPers want WSG to release early that means "people dont want classic". What on earth are you talking about?  
---
They broke records with subs for classic wow. Wake up
---
It was a pug got lucky. Although since 60 (and I was 2 weeks behind world first guy) this is my first roll to win an epic
---
Seriously.
---
Some people just love complaining instead of bucking the fuck up and doing what they have to do.
---
I'm on *Skeram Alliance* and I still do BRD regularly. Probably the most hardcore Alliance experience outside Herod.
---
another boomer enters the fray to defend his kin
---
Since I keep my mouse pointer usually to the right it makes it more comfortable to target raid frames, not too much use as a warrior but useful for my healer. And tbh besides from the block of a full raid I'd say the majority is pushed down to see just fine... I've never had a problem on the frames blocking my sight from the right, like an enemy i didn't notice or something like that.
---
its bis for holy paladins
---
Anyone who hasn't completed the quest cannot receive loot. If for some reason someone was able to receive a piece of loot without completing the quest, then that's the bug. It's not the other way around.
---
If people are this salty about world PvP being a thing, I’m really looking forward to that
---
Agreed.i like the r red old world and the difficulty of the classic world, but I have done it all already. The gear is subpar and poorly itemized. Blatantly broken classes that are just junk.
---
Remember there's a lot of other countries out there than yours, many of which do not engage in hero worship of soldiers.
---
You also had people who played on private servers and knew how bad the world is with populations not designed for it. This is why I wanted the original population caps, but those don't count to the #nochanges crowd for no reason.
---
Ach  shut up mate don't even start to talk about PvP with me
---
Your so called "PvP" is one gigantic clusterfuck off bullshit  and has nothing to do with actual PvP
---
It's fun for 2 hours to rofl stomp PvP with your deathsquad but don't you feel the need after that for an actual challenge instead of who's spamming more aoe?
---
Will have to visit BG NPC. Same goes for TBC.
---
Bgs are cross realm, fyi.
---
And if you think you're gonna be the head of an organized world pvp army I have bad news for you.
---
I play on a high pop server. Quit making excuses dude. It’s not nearly as bad as you’re making it out to be.
---
Edit: I play alliance on Stalagg. Please tell me I’m not out numbered.
---
they just read the bis lists and just beeline for the items listed there.
---
Which server are you on?
---
That doesn't change the fact that you currently look silly talking shit behind your numbers. The only reason I want bgs is so I can have fun wpvp'ing again. I don't to play bgs
---
Come join Alliance if you like 1v400 lol
---
You spelled BWL wrong.
---
Exactly. Only people against this idea are the ones whose faction is the majority in a given realm.
---
I played on blackrock and the horde out numbered alliance.
---
I play alliance on mirage raceway and have no complaints. No queues, but busy enough that I never have issues finding groups to join with.
---
Lmao, yes it did
---
Well too bad. Better than having ridiculous 8:2 ratio.
---
You what it's the opposite for b
---
Horde gadget Zan epl wpl are unusable for horde
---
Hey I guess that rly means our server is balanced
---
&gt;  but it won't be the same premade every time 
---
Which SUCKS. My premade in vanilla would fight against 2 horde premades, which made it personal. We got to know them really well and it created a permanent rivalry (sometimes friendship). It was amazing. Really going to miss that aspect of battlegrounds.
---
Max rank 4 even if you PVPed 24/7. Realistically for someone who isn't PVPing efficiently (TM/SS is not efficient) 10+ hours a day, rank 3.
---
True this is the same though, he wants a reaction. I mean he doesn't care what people think of him to him even if it's publicity because everyone hates him he still seems to like that.
---
This gaming values thing is so fucking silly.  My pre made bg group rolled you in 2005 too.
---
Yep but we aka the horde always owns Blackrock
---
Thanks for the link, looks pretty legit.  I'll take a look and judge off this!
---
It doesn't affect me and I'm not worried about it.
---
What I don't like is people bitching and blaming blizzard for them making a decision blizzard largely told them not to do.  The problem is there is no solution the player will be happy with and they want to pretend X solution would fix everything.  X solution doesn't work and it will just lead to people bitching about that.
---
I never played retail. I never played vanilla. Open world pvp is literally my victims running away from me, including level 60s. If I had 2-4 real 1v1s in the last 3 days that would be saying a lot. Aside from that it's roaming death squads killing off people 1 by 1. I have no clue what bullshit you've been smoking but it clearly has clouded your judgement.
---
PS: 300+ solo Kills so I know what I'm talking about. The game needs bgs now.
---
do you have your thrash blade still? use that until you get something better
---
I understand your point. Right now, as it is though, it's not worth my time to play. I'm gonna wait until things die down.
---
Stats and damage.
---
In any later iterations of wow, there's no comparable powerspike than being able to decimate an entire town and kill everyone in sight. People just generally don't know what they want, because they play classic and whine about things they don't like but still continue playing because everything else sucks in comparison.
---
People are just bunch of whiners #nochanges
---
My point is that it's extremely common to build such fallacious argument. It's stupid. Unfortunately, it's also very common.
---
This is just going to be a repeated issue. Especially in aspects of the game where the community has a lot of influence over (such as wPvP). The community has change and just isn't the same anymore. In the age of MOBAs and toxic gaming, it seems everyone is a "shit lord" (as a vanilla friend put it). Its like people want to see others quit the game. 
---
I honestly expect the following to happen.
---
1. Well see posts on the honor rank gearing system being too intense. They can't get PvP gear, etc. 
---
2. BGs wont be what people remember, especially if some "leet" strategy is figured out that completely turns what we remember on its head
---
3. Balance will come up. People will be upset against the balance in the game. This game isn't amazingly balanced in 1v1 fights. Ranged classes can very easily destroy melee classes. Some more easily than others. I suspect this will come up
---
4. PvE geared players destroying none geared people. Someine in full raid epics, bwl, whatever; they'll much more easily destroy other players who aren't the same level. Last expansion people complains about this a bunch on retail. Its gonna happen again. 
---
5. Any events dealing with the open world (such as gates)
---
There aren't dead servers in classic. The lowest pop is massively larger than the largest pop was in vanilla.
---
/tar \*partial of their name\*
---
done.
---
Nightslayer is better, do not fall for the people saying "t0 sims higher", they are noobs and any high ranking rogue will tell you the same.
---
I honestly would be very curious as to how servers and server balance back 15 years ago compare to server balance today. I'm not familiar with statistics from back in the day, but I do not recall it being this abhorrent.
---
Didn't realize that, but also yes, the standard immediate food/water
---
What kind of oil is in that Mechanical Yeti!?
---
Yikes, maybe I just let my sub run out and come back when everything settles down.
---
Yea I'm on Heartseeker, it's FAR worse than kromcrush. Just wait it out.
---
Yes that was my point
---
Meh 10v10s or even sometimes 20v20s are pretty fun. It’s when it’s 2 giant death balls of mage and warlock aoe spam in no mans land it gets boring. But it does make for epic screenshots
---
All i know is that im done. I'll try again when phase 3 comes out.
---
Interesting. Most servers match [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro)'s numbers but Whitemane's is massively wrong. IF pro's shows a 60/40 split in favor of Horde, which is actually fairly even vs most servers.
---
I guess people were excepting 1v1's with crowds keeping others from interfering and a /bow before fighting lol.
---
Not ten years, think it was around 2012 when that word started being used on the League of Legends forums. Was coined by a League red/admin “Lyte”. Definitely not a new word however and by now is used outside of gaming circles. Correct me if I’m wrong.
---
You should be requiring everyone to need on these type of recipes regardless of who needs. It's a pug group so people can need for money.
---
You know some classes can track humans right?
---
This. People without connections will either end up facing premades in wsg or gank groups in the outer wilds. The only thing that doesn't change is their whining.
---
What faction are you?
---
Indeed, it is one of the few incredibly balanced servers in terms of A:H ratios. I hope it stays that way as well. But it is one of the only well balanced servers.
---
Bruh. This guys is telling people to kill themselves if they don’t agree with him and you think the other people are the bullies?????
---
&gt;and mid combat is when he gets the alerts of all the 60s nearby.
---
Did they use spells though? That's the key detail here. Basically, at any point, if someone (close enough) uses any kind of ability (or swaps auras, or mounts up, you get the drill) then Spy will identify it. If you do absolutely nothing and there is not change in your status, then you should not get information coming from other users.
---
However, just to show how sensitive this can be, if you have a paladin in your group with an aura and you get out of range, "XXX Aura fades away from YYY" will come up as a message, which means you get detected by Spy.
---
It really depends on your playstyle. Daggers is burstier but Swords has much more control.
---
Almost all bosses (classic &amp; retail) are immune to most forms of cc.
---
This. Sometimes the Tanks are so careful and im already inches away from aggro range of the next group, chugging water. Would love to have some drink that wouldnt need half a minute to fill my mana bar though
---
Same, but in reverse. I play late, and it’s REALLY late on my server so most of the horrible players are asleep.
---
Oh you've had worse experience than me. But it's similar. The game is shitshow when you'd have to be soooooo careful to hearth so you don't get ganked.
---
im not familiar with countries like that, but if you had heard the noise around don cherry from hockey night in canada and what he said, i fully support his statement, albeit worded harshly. search up what he had said if you arent familiar. maybe only Canadians know about this lol
---
Exactly. I intentionally wake up earlier than I have to just so I can get those few hours in doing something I enjoy in peace and quite. I have accepted that I’ll probably never get to raid due to playing at 5-7 am pst but doesn’t stop me from levelling every class to 60....or it wouldn’t if I wasn’t being murdered every other mob. I may have to roll an alt until BGs get released, questing in any of the high level areas is just a nightmare.
---
Depends on what phase you played in, it was a shit show early on just like it is now. Once BGS are out it'll die down. I remember people camping entrances though and i remember people standing on roofs quite a bit as well even after BGS.
---
stop with "sim" shit, the game was figured out years ago on nos, stop trying to reinvent the wheel, everyone who pushes "sims" is a pleb that probably parses under 70
---
This sub is so fucked up. This guy is literally telling people to kill themselves if they disagree and people are agreeing with him.
---

Yeah, there are lots of shorty things that aren’t surprises. Doesn’t make them not shitty.
---
You are entitled to disagree. A more in depth response on why you disagree would be more fruitful towards a discussion and even potential resolution!
---
It was clear as soon as blizzard released their 6 phase plan with honor in p2 and BGs in p3 that this situation would manifest itself on pvp servers.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect these dots.  People who chose to play alliance on pvp servers literally did sign up for this broken bullshit.
---
If you arent minmaxing this method isnt for you. This has nothing to do with age or anything
---
PvE servers exist
---
Literally 1 phase of no honor. 4 phases of bgs which kill wpvp and people couldn’t make it a week before bitching about wpvp.
---
Jesus logic is so hard huh. Most of the zoomers born in the late 90's/early 2000s are from early 80s millennials, because yes most people have kids in their early 20s. Boomers born in the early 40s gave birth to the gen xers, and yes some of the boomers in the early 60s had some millenial children. The kids who adopt the "okboomer" thing are usually teenagers born from 80s millennials. Most gen Xers gave birth to 90s millennials. The generations don't just skip each other, there is a ton of intersection and you're wrong. Don't @ me.

My gnome is named Tripodd, I tell people it’s Tripod with the extra D 😉
---
Mom, bathroom!!
---
Everyone that actually cares about PvP and does not just remember the sooooo coooool 200 vs 200 battles with their nostalgia glasses saw this coming
---
Especially with how many ppl are on a single server
---
See alliance, kill alliance.
---
This is something that should have been implemented from the beginning to work without outcry. Blizzard dropped the ball here.
---
Faction-specific queue should not exist without faction switching now that we are months after the release. Or else you punish a huge part of the Horde faction not participating in these Honor-farming death balls.
---
 Sudden queues with no alternative (faction switching) would lock them out from continuing to play a character they might have had for months now.
---
Edit: Just to slip this in: It's highly unlikely that Blizzard-Activision would do this, though. As perfect as it sounds, I doubt they want to spend money on the problem by hiring GMs to help with transfers. It's not exactly their MO anymore.
---
I started in early December 2004 and played continuously through mid-Wrath.
---
Of course, play Hemorrhage Swords! I've played both and Hemo Swords is much more fun.
---
Answer me this. Do you think that it's the same people who really wanted wPVP and now really want BGs to be released earlier?
---
I'm so tired of this fallacious argument. There are so many different people in this sub with so many different ideas, thoughts and wishes. It's so disingenuous to put everyone as part of a confused and erratic hive-mind and build arguments based on that just so you (not you in particular) can feel superior.
---
"lol this sub, some of you love the Horde, but I see some of you with Alliance flairs? make up your mind lmao". It's basically that.
---
I got my leaf Wednesday night (hunter) I can’t get the burning steppes demon because horde come and fuck it up every attempt.
---
It's far too late though. Faction specific transfers should have been from very early on or never. Faction balance on those servers is already way too far gone to be fixable from the months of the minority faction leaving with free transfers, implementing it now is just trapping people in a shit show that blizzard allowed to fester to that degree it is now.
---
But yeah, if you're level 17 still, definitely re roll on a different server, there are a few that are still well balanced
---
So if there's actual demand, buy the undercutters out and resell. I see no problem here if you're trying to make money.
---
They need to merge low pop servers, not put out more.
---
This^ it’s just a numbers game and whether they surprise you or not. It has zero skill involved and makes getting anywhere a pain in the butt. 
---
BRM takes me 7 deaths to get to any of the entrances. I’ve heard guildies saying they just want to quit, not fun to be camped endlessly.
---
Maybe you can't. I'm 54 on a server unbalanced against me and doing fine.
---
Yeah, it can be scary but that's warcraft.
---
big pvp fights are mostly decided by aoe especially guild vs guild, buy some sappers
---
&gt;Does he realize you can flag for PVP on a PVE?
---
I don't think many people realized this when they picked their server. They probably thought that PvE = no world pvp ever. 
---
Also a bunch of people played on pvp servers back in the day, so they naturally drifted to those. I know all my friends did.
---
That’s because most of the people complaining are baby back bitches
---
Lol look at heartseeker. It's the most unbalanced server passing Stalagg, and is alliance dominated. They do all the same stuff that caused them to leave their servers to begin with.
---
You really think guilds wait for recklessness for every boss?
---
What are backpedaling and keyboard turning?
---
Haha
---
Yes, but this is for the majority of the playerbase who still spend several hours in MC a week. Personally I'm all for the spellpower greens, but when examining pre-bis lists, they're catering it more towards the players take a couple of minutes on these fights. 
---
The absurdly fast kills and clears don't use very many casters though, so it does kind of skew the results.
---
Decided? Blizz hasn't even given any indication they're considering it.
---
I think you might be playing on a potato if that’s happening to you. I had no issues in these with 100+ people battles and ridiculous aoe spam.
---
It wasn’t an issue then, it isn’t an issue today is what I’m saying, your entire argument rested on (me) saying we shouldn’t have faction information. History proves it wasn’t needed. It was never available. You’re overly entitled to something being done immediately and without haste. 
---
WPVP dies when battlegrounds is released, it’s that simple.
---
How important are hunter pet ability ranks? Should I be flying about trying to get an ability ASAP or just wait till it's easier? And should I just do a pig till cats get dash? Just abandoned Piggers for The Rake and I miss charge.
---
That’s the biggest issue to me. These poor guys JUST hit 60 and the “war” in BRM is making a lot of them quit (or hate their lives) 
---
Let them farm in peace, like we were able to do.
---
this shows perfectly why you think you do but you dont is 1000% accurate
---
I mean, if that's the case then you're kind of screwed anyways though, as you'll be running pretty low on mana if they chain pull like that.
---
What?
---
Most of the time these 'top-end guilds' have a similar environment as the casual ones. People know each other, do fun stuff together and usually just have a good time. Speedrunning is not a weekly thing, it's being done because people enjoy it. The guild may appear toxic from the outside, but it's not really different than any other guild. I've seen casual guilds going way higher on the 'toxic'-meter than these guilds would do.
---
Oh gods, this cracked me up. Great Monday morning chuckle.
---
They could ban people from picking their faction or class. The server would pick these for you based on what was under represented. Nice and balanced. Not a serious suggestion, but about as realistic as anything else.
---
gutgore is not a solid mh dagger
---
go for perds and cht :D
---
Felwood, Azshara, Un'goro Crater, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, maybe Western Plaguelands.  For dungeons: ZF, Mara, maybe ST.  Or is there something I'm missing?
---
It's because of your bad attitude.  Dance next time maybe they will leave you alone
---
6-10 deaths to get to the entrances. Every single time. That’s NOT fun
---
Thing is if you slowly start taking all those things out of the game you end up with BFA. As shitty as it is I would still rather play classic than current.
---
no
---
God DAMN you're bellend.
---
Hi! Sorry to ask, is there a useful guide you've found to set up remote desktop?
---
Why do alliance players bitch so much?
---
I mean, if you can't see the pat coming from the front that's on you and your awareness. Also, the tank can probably see the pat coming and can pick it up. You're more likely to get fucked over by an ass pulled pat than a face pulled one.
---
You picked a pvp realm and you don't like it because you are not the top dog. Let me tell you, even if you were lv60 right now, there is always someone who spends more time ingame getting better gear than you, so in the end it doesn't even matter.
---
Your problem here is not being able to get away with investing less time ingame than your adversaries. Your problem is actually your time investment, not the game.
---
If you’re dying 6-10 times you’re doing it wrong.
---
Server
---
post guild and logs
---
You Sip-&gt;Run just before every mana tick
---
I don't really disagree with you here. Problems are predominantly player induced. Simultaneously players don't want egregiously imbalanced servers. Something's gotta give. Either we the players adapt and change, or the problems will remain and if not become more problematic. If you think the problems are bad now, wait until horde BG queue times are hour long. Then I can't wait for all the horde naysayers (Go retail, etc. etc. ) to be flooding the forums that BG queue times are unacceptable. We are the problem and we must be the solution. Give up your WoTFSK and come trade it for escape artist or perception. Or don't. I'm just trying to be part of the solution. I also know others have started returning to alliance due to some of these problems. It may not be much, but it's a start.
---
Yes. My UBRS group had to replace 4 people that gave up trying to get into the mountain. It’s madness.
---
At least you're not a prot warrior.  
---
I've come to my inevitability and park him in UC waiting for raid nights.
---
I would be very weary of people saying your fine in cat form as DPS.  The reason I say this is for an all together different reason, but similar trigger.  Currently, druids in form are still able to be Mana drained, this is not only unintended, but also shows the game is still letting Mana based triggers to happen.  The lava burst could very well be able to target you for the same reason our Mana can still be targeted, when it should not.
---
That guy sounds so much like Payo.
---
You don't get any honor
---
you really shouldn't try arguing with redditors they're just gonna make references to pop culture try to ad hominem you lol, let them be bad
---
Will do.
---
That’s just one example.
---
then join one pussy
---
Could we have a keyring first?
---
How would you suggest Blizzard make people play Alliance instead of Horde? And if you expect people in 2019 not to play like assholes then I don't know what to tell you. It's an old game but we're playing with today's crowd. Nothing can be done about that.
---
yes but it's  a pain in this ass to find the coords and commands.
---
I always forget them and it's very hard to find them online
---
But you realize if you want to PVP without being ganked and camped you can roll on a PVE server? The analogy makes no sense when that option exists.
---
It's as if everyone complaining didn't understand that you can still do world PVP on a PVE server and that there is still raid v raid world PVP going on right now on PVE servers but without the ganking and camping of flight paths. You can still encounter other players and PVP them if you want on fair terms. It's what everyone says they want.
---
It's EXACTLY what people complaining here say they want but for some reason keep shooting down as the solution....
---
Is it just they don't want to be judged by the internet memelords for being on a PVE realm?
---
I'm not trying to just be one of those people saying "lol roll pve noob" trolls I'm just wondering why people don't seem to realize PVE is exactly what they claim they want...
---
Not really. wPvP was more small skirmishes, or planning a city raid or having similar lvl pvps. 
---
Server size was not as big as this back in 1.3 vanilla. It's is nearly triple. We also have a lot more lvl 60s. 
---
40+ people camping FP, camping corpses, making the game literally unplayable is not wPvP. 
---
People think vanilla wow was similar, but it isn't. The realm size and the relative number of 60 is making the game shitshow.
---
Awesome. I had a similar experience helping a couple of friends of a guild member through BRD. All jumped on discord, chatted about the lore, and got to see the instance through the eyes of two players going through BRD for the first time.
---
So refreshing after all the arena/anger spam groups that seem to be the norm
---
Put it before the shapeshift part
---
Well there's only really one direction we can go from here, and it's not backward. With the insane server populations and faction imbalances which Blizzard is allowing, when it comes to pvp instanced is better in my view, and that's another thing which BC does better than classic.
---
Finding groups as a rogue is honestly kind of tough. But finding a warrior that wants to tank is even tougher.
---
I think you are 100% right since those ench does in fact take up a buff spot
---
It is week 1 of honor system and people flippin a nut. OF COURSE it is insane right now, people have been waiting for their kills to mean somthing since launch. Releasing BGs to kill wpvp, and its gonna happen later. Just hold your booty and wait until normal launch schedule. 
---
Have fun while it lasts. DHKs dont mean anything this week anyways. Once BGs are released, these types of events will be rare. Spend time enjoying the now, instead of crying and wanting the better future, only to realized you missed your chance to do what you can only do pre-BG release.
---
Nah he’s right you seem like a miserable, lonely shut in.
---
haha thats awesome :D
---
Yea I agree with bringing battlegrounds in sooner rather than later, this bg'less honor system time is a shitshow but that's to be expected. This is only going to last for a very limited window of time and then all those pvpers will be in bg's so the roving gank-raids don't bother me too much. It's kind of an interesting time to see it playout but it will definitely wear out it's welcome sooner rather than later
---
Master disgrace
---
Classic+ is a pipedream. Blizzard will never turn down free money and they've said themselves that BC and Wrath (ick) will be easy to implement now that they've made classic.
---
Our time will come brother.
---
It definitely can show you the coordinates
---
Isn't this every ones strategy?
---
No one needs to die either if you avoid reapplying your dots when she is nearly going to land.
---
The key is really just having DPS who aren't bothered by the damage meters and are happy to go slow and steady.
---
“If you rolled a pvp server this is part of the game” lmao corpse running for hours and taking 45 min just to complete a quest right by the fp isn’t what anyone intended and it’s broken. 
---
Game is literally unplayable for a good part of the player base but as long as your on the winning side right? 
---
“This is such a bad opinion” aye when you point one finger you got three pointing right back at you buddy.
---
Uhh yea, that is what people are upset about.
---
Reroll / make an alt :)
---
There wasn't a hunter there. 2 warriors a shaman, a priest and a warlock.
---
Because the people who actually enjoy it are playing the game and not complaining on reddit
---
You can also look into your history to see every single encounter you've ever had since installing spy.
---
Yeah echo this, bloodfang is awesome. Bit quiet around 12-8am GMT for casual pugs but outside of that, all good. Probs a bit of a horde bias but I do see a hell of a lot of ally running around killing me so who knows.
---
Oh you read some people's opinions on something and then read some other people's opinions on another matter at a later date...hilarious
---
I didnt think balance druids had mana issues in classic?
---
Isnt oomkin rolled over from TBC? I thought moonkins issue was damage?
---
Jesus Christ, people just regurgitate this shit nonstop. Is it just a meme at this point? I don’t disagree but it just sounds so neckbeardy
---
I think it's pretty awesome... it's why I joined a pvp server
---
You were bullied and you feel like you grew from this so you want to help others grow in the same way. Is that right?
---
Because you experienced bullying you want to provide this experience to others?
---
I believe another person here claimed a GM told them they couldn't un do wrong quest rewards now even if they wanted to.
---
Oh little kobold, candle only the beginning ...
---
It is all because of the [implication](https://media1.tenor.com/images/4f8e9856c2a2315ca9838178c793dcbf/tenor.gif)...
---
People in their 50’s who have to corpse drag for 30-40 minutes just to get from the flight path to the BRD instance wholly disagree with your “oh just deal with it for two months” attitude.
---
Gratz on you no-lifing to 60 so that you can camp instance entrances and oneshot low level players with your friends. If you had to deal with this bullshit when you were in your 50’s you wouldn’t be as happy with it.
---
Smorc does not look kindly upon the alliance
---
12:30 mark. This was the first thing that came up in google...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo
---
Cross realm bg's are the first step in becoming like shitty retail....if they allow people to queue up from cities I might quit.
---
IT'S A COOKBOOOOK
---
OP, I'm curious, are you a returning player to WoW ? Meaning, have you stopped playing for a few years, and came back because of Classic ?
---
Are you going to try it again?
---
I just wanna finish the last 5 levels without getting killed every 30 seconds
---
Yeah it really did feel like two different movies glued together. Even as a long time Alliance main I found the CG orc parts way, way more enjoyable than the live action Alliance parts.
---
They really should have just done the whole thing as CG.
---
Wowheads data is 52-48% and its over 2 months old.
---
My info is from https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
And if your advice is that they should leave the server then clearly you agree with me and the other guy that they dont have a chance.
---
Not sure what his class has to do with this.
---
Yes, it levels in real time (always depending on your current skill). So you can craft it then go for Goblin. Although I believe the base level is 40 something even if you don't have engineering at all.
---
World PvP is boring when it's multiple raids moving back and forth in waves with some and lag. Good fun world PvP is storming the enemy city gates, or roaming zones in groups of 2-5 looking for a fight with other groups of 2-5. 
---
World PvP is meant to be organic, not aoe farmed from the lone ranger that steps too far from the herd trying to make a push.
---
I feel your pain
---
Well, plenty of people have made suggestions for that. You have a server population limit, they just need to make those limits faction specific so people can’t roll a horde or alliance character on a server with an 80/20 ratio.
---
And again, I fully expect people to be assholes and knew this was going to be a problem if blizzard didn’t put things in place early to deal with this. 
---
Also, you’re horde, aren’t you.
---
I'm west coast and this makes farming anything at a reasonable time pretty bad. No matter how early I get up itll already be 3 hours later for every person on the east coast. The only window I have if I want to get something like broken tooth is 1-3 am. That's a time you have to stay up til and cant just get up early for
---
What day is HK reset? Just want to make sure I get my 15 HKs in each week (some weeks I wont have much time).
---
The name of the Quest is very relevant though!
---
The programmer at Blizzard that thought up of the "dishonorable kills" idea must have had it run down the slope of their forehead.
---
Im on the underdog side and Im honestly kinda torn on this.
---
On one hand getting zerged with no chance of fighting back is just super lame and boring, but on the other it allows for some seriously amazing moments and the game really feels like a full on war right now. 
---
Running around in a small group avoiding the deathballs and steamrolling smaller groups or picking off stragglers is a ton of fun. Nothing more satisfying than stomping overconfident emote spammers in an even fight once their buddies leave them behind, and of course they always get stomped cause horde cant pvp.
---
The game kinda feels like Rust right now.
---
Having said that I havent finished a single quest since p2 came out and some zones are literally impossible to exist in outside of ghost form, and thats just boring.
---
Yea cause the game is literally broken. Yea there other options (witch I’m playing on alt too) but for the plain fact that the game became unplayable at certain points is frustrating and will only lead to more people quitting as it is. Definitely a bad turn for blizzard, we can only hope for fixes in the future.
---
Hi, /u/DogeAndGabbana
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dxtg3d/how_to_break_poly_on_pet/). 
---
&gt;  This mod gives you the ability to see through walls, terrain, view distance limitations, and then you can target them before they are even possible to normally target an enemy player. 
---
"The combat log gives you the ability to see through walls, terrain, view distance limitations, and then you can target them by typing /tar \[name\]"
---
ftfy
---
buffs already applied i think, and you can already do that with the combat log
---
I disagree, I think you don't really understand what is happening.
---
Depends if your faction is the one with most players or not however. I passed plenty of horde while in ghost form questing happily :P
---
However, questing aside, dungeons now just comes with an initial timesink that people might still have time for.  So going lv50-60 in dungeons might still be doable. I went from 49-53 myself since Thursday for instance.
---
You spend 30-45 min getting into for instance BRD (even with 10 deaths), then you run several runs with resets. If you know you'll be back soon you can log out in the dungeon as well. Grab extra pieces of gear for durability to be able to stay longer. Also remember as long as it is a pvp battle that kills you, you won't lose any durability on the way :)
---
Lmao Shazzrah... That's the worst example of what you want.
---
I know this guy!
---
I found him escorting his 3 level 20something warlock alts to DM the night before it released.
---
I saved his lowbie asses from getting killed by some mobs and helped him get to DM and when I pointed out the obvious (setting up a paid summon service during the rush) he offered me free summons when it opened.
---
Some of these warriors are alts. The rest is spread between 2 guild raids and a guild organized pug raid.
---
Each raid has about 6-8 warriors depending on the week. 2 warriors always being tanks and therefore not needing DPS gear to begin with. Warriors/Rogue have loot priorities over casters on key items such as Onyxia Head. Most of these warriors will rank to 14, giving them the majority of BiS gear anyway. It may sound like a harsh environment, but there is little to no difference compared to 'regular guilds'. The amount of raids simply solve the gear issue.
---
Okay. After being camped like a mofo, I decided to do dungeon runs. Like you said. With my lvl, I tried to do mara princess runs. But mind you, there are at least 30 hordes camping the whole region. Corpse dragging at least 10 times, and dying 10 more in front of the portal area. And trying to get everyone inside the dungeon after using the scepter took at least an hour. 
---
You're just failing to recognize what many people are experiencing. So many people are quitting, as evident from my guild as well as subreddits. With triple the size of original WoW, and a lot more lvl 60s, the game has turned into a shitshow. And it was already a shitshow in original WoW P2.
---
Which is currently the case for 1/2 the realms, so you’d be preventing a huge amount of people from playing? Is it their fault they rolled horde or alliance (some realms are alliance dominated)? They pay the same amount as you, why should they be denied the right to play
---
How do I look through the history?
---
This is so cringey, I can't even explain how cringe it is. Good luck with your 15 year old nostalgia, boomer. Try not to build too much of an identity around it, okay? It's just a video game, and making it your sole identity is just pathetic.
---
All I'm reading in this thread is people can't handle PVP servers.
---
Get to 52 and grind BRD is the advice I've been given.
---
&gt;Jesus Christ, people just regurgitate this shit nonstop
---
Because people make the same complaints day in and day out when the response is already there. There's no reason for this thread when there's dozens complaining about the exact same issue.
---
&gt;Is it just a meme at this point? 
---
It's a response to the same question posted every day.
---
&gt;I don’t disagree but it just sounds so neckbeardy
---
You're playing WoW. It's basically world of neckbeards.
---
I mean.. horde objectively DO have better racials. Beserking, WOTF, Bloodfury, not to include they have better PVE, etc
---
We knew this was coming. Everyone knew. I dont get how you guys didnt see this coming like a freight train. You chose this. You made this choice.
---
Is that an under armor turtleneck?
---
So obviously it's not going to be 2/3 months in the future. 4-6 weeks at max.
---
Yeah, and he is completely wrong. The faction majority don't really enjoy it that much necessarily. Horde outnumber us badly and they whine about it on the server discords. They have no one to kill, which is why they run around and jump on anything.  Being in the minority means you have an abundance of targets and I'm having a great time.
---
God damn dude, stop being so dense. No one blamed you for imbalance. This isn't about you, your rouge, or you anecdotles.  You're being a troll for no reason
---
I think the advice is just for people who can't handle the current state and can't adapt.  If World PvP really destroy your experience it's because you are not polyvalent and experienced enough.
---
There's usually 2-3 zones per level range where you can find quest appropriate for you.  
---
If not, you can grind mobs in a more remote area until things calm down.  Exp/hour might not be as good but gold/hour will.  
---
You can still go in a dungeon and have good exp/hour-gold/hour with 0 chance of being ganked.  
---
You can go fishing to make money  
---
You can roll an Alt  
---
You can help lower level of your guild in dungeons or questing zones.  
---
You can solo farm instances for the Major City Rep Grind  
---
You can participate in World PVP yourself  
---
You can learn to play the auction house to make money while chatting with guildies + watching a movie or playing another game on the side  
---
You can go back to previous zone and try to 100% the quest for shit and what not.
---
Casuals complain because they only have 1-2h to play and can't afford to switch continent or try to work on a new way to make exp and gold.  But I don't want Blizzard to accelerate the release cause it will get us closer to the End of it... And once it's gonna be over we will all look back and wish we knew better  back than.
---
Alliance player here who is on a horde heavy server. Having the time of my fucking life with world pvp, all while leveling from 51 the day the honor system dropped (55 now). Does it suck getting curb-stomped by marauding gank squads? Yes. Is it frustrating as hell to quest sometimes? Of course. Some days I have to completely avoid certain areas because horde has taken over an entire town/FP. But it's making the game more dynamic, and the open world more meaningful. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, trying to be aware of everything. Plus, the feeling of accomplishment when I kill anyone is through the roof, especially when I manage to kill a 60. Teaming up with others to protect the king of IF when a raid surprised us with an attack: completely epic. On top of that, earning  honor  points is fun as fuck. I'm having fun. Sorry to those who aren't, but it truly, finally feels like we are at war with the horde and I'm going to enjoy every last second of it while I can.
---
&gt; It's impossible and stupid to force others not to min/max or be elite.
---
Are you illiterate? If somebody has no desire to play the game *because* of these issues and your reply is 'well you don't have to play like that' and then I explain why that is a legitimate reason to not want to play, you come back with this drivel?
---
How is anything I have said to do with forcing the community to play as that person wants? I'm merely pointing out that your answer to his problem is deeply flawed. **You** are the person dismissing what he says. I am saying it is legitimate. Nowhere in my comment (which you should probably attempt to read at some point) was there anything to do with changing the community.
---
I tried a couple of guides, but they were both ineffiencient and innacurate
---
For example, most wastes *[Heavy Blasting Powder]* for random junk while you could make some money with Iron Grenades
---
So maybe don't use a guide, check [this link](https://classic.wowhead.com/engineering-spells#0+17) and craft what is cheaper on your server
---
I would just grind some bumfuck area. Like some cave in blasted lands or shit like that.
---
You decided to do dungeon runs like I said, and it took you at least an hour....but your first response was 30 minutes ago? Sounds about right.
---
My guess is something like Don Julios ring being BIS (I assume, dont quote me on that, but that’s ring is DANK and probably higher quality than most/all T1 raid melee/hunter rings) maybe there’s something better for PVE where you don’t need the Stam but my itemization is far from memorized 
---
I think casters get really good offhand options too if I can remember. 
---
Honestly I’m not sure it matter that much with now faceroll T1 content is and how shitty some of the T1 itemization is for classes. Having some off pieces from AV already probably won’t make or break someone when bwl drops
---
What you described is exactly what a PVE server is though. You want to PVP when it's fair. That's a PVE server. You see a fair fight you flag yourself you taunt the enemy to do the same and fight. Or you goto a known PVP area and join in the raids already PVPing there.
---
I always look for the cheapest auction, even if it is only 1c undercut. Gotta' respect the hustle.
---
It's ok, let it out.
---
Sorry, no. Move along.
---
Why not roll on a PVE server then?
---
Sounds like you’re describing southshore. Maybe you should venture to other zones because world pvp extends beyond a single zone. South shore isn’t even optimal nor fun. Smaller pvp bouts are way better.
---
I was there and it definitely was not like this. Yes many people were ganking, but the people ganking were level 40 rogues, not level 60 rogues and mages with epic mounts and full tier 1 sets running around in groups of 3-5.
---
When honor was released in vanilla there were almost no level 60s, let alone people with epic mounts and raiding gear. Not only were there much fewer people on a server, they were also much more spread out because the levels of players were more evenly divided between 1-60. Now everyone is in the same level 40-60 areas. The situation is very different now.
---
I heard different. I heard he chose to be a father first and put his career on the back burner.
---
All the complaints should be promptly ignored, morons always whine
---
The weapon spec doesn’t matter,m until you’re raiding, and then maces will lose out to swords by a small margin 
---
I used maces from lvl 40 to 60 because the BOE blues are cheap as fuck. Mt mace was 25g on the AH and the same damage as a 400g Krol blade. 
---
You want a slow main hand weapon regardless of type if you’re using sinister strike or hemo
---
Again, this system just rewards who farms the most outside raids. The trickle down from the split is a drop in the bucket. 
---
I think raid attendance, and maybe performance, should be the only factors in getting raid loot. Apparently that is an unpopular opinion.
---
Thank god there are plenty of types of guilds. I'm not going to play in a guild that expects me to be on 40 hours a week, for 4 hours of raiding, to have a shot at any gear. You people are masochists.
---
I just hear a lot of people complaining about pvp on a pvp server. Go play on PvE if it bothers you so much. In my experience these complaints are highly over blown.
---
and yu should go back to the kindergarden thanks
---
is it really that OP, blizzard should just remove it
---
Uh, everyone who knew what classic was expected this.
---
Yea, Red Ridge is camped on Herod as well.
---
I don't think you really understand the scope of the problem. Every single "strategic" FP, + every single level 40+ zone FP is camped by multiple horde groups at almost all hours.
---
Still going to be more Horde than Alliance on most servers. Plus if balance is what you desire then maybe you're playing the wrong game.
---
Patience.
---
I feel like sooner or later we would see the absolute limit of whats possible. Basically, people would shit themselves trying to finish Naxx and they either would or wouldn't. Either way it'd probably take over endgame for longer than any phase would (in the correct order). So..... yeah, I'd like to see this, too.
---
Friendlies can sometimes group up for killcount or reputation grind. This is particularly notable in the ~55+ areas where relevant. When it's cross faction heavy you have few options.
---
That is pvp. That is what wow pvp has devolved to in the past decade of private servers. U til bgs come out it will be rough. But its week 1 of honor it qill slow down.
---
Version 1.15.1 release - fixed calculation of honor to support the diminishing return effect for honor. It resets when your Today's HK count becomes zero.
---
Sorry to hear that, but that’s not my experience on stalagg.
---
I agree with your philosophy but not your take on this situation. Due to population size and imbalance this is massively changed from Vanilla.
---
Hey, don't assume I down voted you. I didn't. Now, as far as I know there's only two servers where horde are not dominant, one in the us (heartseeker) 1nd one in Europe (forgot which though.) now, I'm not saying you're wrong, I think you can def level solo, especially on Tuesday and Wednesday. However I would believe the guy if he said he couldn't level at all too, ally on my servers don't even quest anymore. Maybe he's on heartseeker.
---
Gonna bet it’s not great as well. Prior to P2 I would generally live and let live with other people around my level questing- now I’ll attack regardless of the situation.
---
You're only flagged if you flag yourself or actually attacked someone else. Otherwise you're instantly deflagged in uncontested zones.
---
&gt; Ye, I remember people pulling Geddon and Shazzrah back to Garr almost from the beginning.
---
You can still do that
---
How can we tell he is stream sniping? Who gives a shit if asmon dies
---
Are you a rogue? If you're not, you have no idea what you're talking about, or maybe you're talking about large scale pvp which isn't efficient anyway. If you are, you're simply bad at your class which is pretty sad for a rogue who has arguably the most unfair toolkit pvp-wise. I've had no troubles with enemies using the spy addon. I use it too, and I usually can't find the rogues either as that's not what we excel at. The rogues being found through the spy addon are usually found by mages/warriors/other AoE in large scale pvp, and that's a losing fight already.
---
Rule 3: no witch hunting. Ninja looting happens, but you can't go blurting his name out on this subreddit.
---
There were also mods just like spy available for private servers, so I still don't see where you're coming from. You act like there was some golden age of WoW where this didn't exist and that's just not the case.
---
25-35 is not in HK range for 60s, and therefore is irrelevant.
---
Maybe I should have said "Care Bear and prod of it!"
---
During vanilla I killed like 4k+ whelps for my pet got three epics five rares was offered a epic mount worth of gold.
---
Kept it and to this day it's the only pet I care About.
---
Took over a week of non stop killing after I got home from work. I even got called a Chinese gold bot which I did find a few of them and reported them.
---
It became a prison and a Zen like expreince to this day I have never attempted anything like it again.
---
I don't understand the people who had some mythological world pvp idea, because honestly this is pretty much what it was like.  Too many people need to understand vanilla wasn't some great glory day of wow, but a time when a combination of lack of information and incredibly suboptimized players were dominant.
---
Information about how the game works has gone up massively.  How to play optimally has gone up.  Anyone going back to play classic is taking those concepts with them, instead of playing a game we had to figure out as we went.
---
What we are left with is a dramatically larger percentage of a population who are going to do all the try hard things.  We have people who are going to start their grind for r14 even though there is a thousand other people doing it as well.  We have people burning through dungeons trying to get the specific item on their list.
---
The people aren't happy because they sold themselves on some idea that the game was different.  It wasn't.  The playerbase dramatically changed how it approaches a game like this though.  Everyone bitching has to understand the game is the same, they are the ones who have changed.
---
I'm talking about the original P2 back in 2005. They honeslty should've released BG with P2. But no, the same shitshow.
---
Hi Flicky
---
The people enjoying it are probably just quiet about it. I love it to be honest.
---
I don't think ones ability to no life farm gold solo should factor into who gets the most raid loot. I'm astonished that that is an unpopular opinion. 
---
The gold split at the end is a drop in the bucket.
---
I always do. Charge&gt;demo. Reduces 1/3-1/4 of the damage I take normally. With a well fed bonus and troll pot I almost never have to sit
---
&gt;in World PvP you can actually determine the outcome by yourself.
---
Oh yeah I feel totally in control of the outcome when I die 3 seconds after landing at Light's Hope.
---
Even more so when I die 3 more times getting out of there.
---
Please let me know if you find any issue
---
Yup, horde.
---
It's the same alliance on my server will try to kill you if you give then an HK
---
everyone complaining is just a casual really
---
I mean I went, had some fun, only stuck around long enough to get on the southshore inn roof cuz it reminded me of when me and my friends would go on the goldshire roof in actual vanilla then i left lol.  I'm not a huge fan of large scale world pvp in general, even with even teams I prefer either 1v1s or like 5v5s.  I chose to play a warrior tho so the 1v1 life is pretty rough lmao.
---
Tbe thing about WPvP is that it's a greasy dirty affair. Open world no rules street gang violent assaults is kinda the name of the game.
---
Don't expect a fair duel. But there's totally a certain shit disturbing fun to be had. Gank squads preying on single targets isn't efficient but people see their safety in numbers, it's a very psychological thing.
---
LOL
---
Because I enjoy pvp! Well I did back when I played it the first time round. I dont have the time to grind it out any more which is a shame, I reckon if I could play for more than an hour every few days I'd be a little more committed.
---
Yes. It's in the keybind settings.
---
QQ is strong in ph2
---
Perfect example on why all need on BoE is the preferable why to handle loot
---
Considering im alliance no. And in no way do i think that. Your just being extra salty. Just wait it out. Stop bitching. Get people organized go about your gameplay the hype for honor grind will fall off in a week or so massively. Bgs qill come out and it will hit a cliff. Either endure it or take o a break for a week. This is wow wpvp. This is what you signed up for.
---
Reading both these forums and the WoW forums have shown me how tone-deaf people are. 
---
The intention may not have been to be racist, it happens but there is a lot of discourse around the world between western medicine and traditional, alternative methods of medicine that IS rooted in racism and classism.
---
Biomedicine itself is DEEPLY rooted in racism, examples below:
---
https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henriettalacks/ 
---
- Cells taken and used for research against her family’s knowledge/consent with similar acts against the black communities in the area from Johns Hopkins.
---
https://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/23/forced-sterilization-in-puerto-rico/ 
---
- Forced sterilization of brown women for the sake of research 
---
And I know how this community gets so this is gonna get downvoted to hell but w.e. 
---
The argument against alternative medicine is that it’s the placebo effect, but regardless of the modality through which the medicine functions it is still medicine. Lots of biomedicine is bullshit too. All in all, ignorance  of the debate going on globally about alternative medicine still equates to racism regardless of intention.
---
Yeah, as the other guys said, you should check your source about your server being ally dominated, might change your view.
---
I've played private servers since the time of wowscape. It was never as bad as this.
---
What’s the unit frames addon? And is the enemy nameplates one separate? (showing debuff durations) Thanks.
---
Reddit in a nut shell.
---
Pretty sure thrash mh and mirah oh.
---
Thank you
---
There’s 400k in this sub. Opinions vary?
---
Sometimes yes, but I found Thorium Point to be too overpopulated. People seem to forget that you can get 100x more honor from one kill if you're alone vs if there's a giant horde raid there (which TP often has). Also, if the tables turn and a massive Alliance raid shows up which happens much more often than at Morgan's Vigil, you have to hide well and be VERY careful in picking off stragglers, which can slow down your honor farm.
---
My questie does this in westfall as well. Just so many nodes on the map when you first hit the zone
---
&gt;Even battlegrounds might not be able to solve it fully
---
Solve what fully, world pvp?
---
That's objectively bad for the game. 
---
I get that the ganking pretty insane right now; but if you want to stop being ganked completely you need to play on a PvE server.
---
Why is that more efficient than fighting in hillsbrad where you can get 100ish HKs an hour?
---
The desire for classic world pvp doesn't have anything to do with not having bgs. 
---
When I first heard about classic, I even assumed that BGs would be here from the start. And then when I heard the honor system wasn't coming till phase 2, I assumed BGs would come out then.
---
I started playing in Vanilla right when BGs were first released, so all of my fond memories of world pvp have nothing to do with the clusterfuck we're experiencing now.
---
Everyone saying, "lol but I thought you guys wanted world pvp" to people suggesting BGs be released early are being either willfully disingenuous or just too dumb to understand the nuance of the situation we're seeing.
---
Except the way it stands, the 5 are going to kill, corpse camp, teabag, and /spit on the 2 until they quit, then whine endlessly when it rapidly becomes 5v0.
---
Because there are more people playing classic obviously. But it will pass. Just take a break for a few days as the initial wave of pvp plays out.
---
If you’re rolling alliance consider benediction.  We are east coast pvp and have good balance.  Alliance got both first azuregos and kazzak kills here.  Great server.
---
I rerolled her two months ago from stalagg when I realized it was gonna be a shit show.
---
i am with you, #nochanges isnt accurate anymore anyway. i am all for changes as long as we keep the spirit of classic and its really not hard to not cross that line.
---
fishing has been more fun to me than grinding honor and since my sub run out, i will take a break and come back  for bgs. some good games to play out there without that much nonsense.
---
&gt; Huge open world wars between two factions which is completely voluntary IS pvp.
---
I mean this is literally the point of a PvE server. It's voluntary. PvP server is involuntary.
---
Seems like most people just rolled the wrong server.
---
And yes things should calm down in a few weeks but the level of entitlement and salt in this sub is unreal.
---
Nah - it was just unsuccessful. Ya can't really undo the curse of undeath. At best, in later expansions, it was shown you can "Ascend" them ala Nathanos so at least they aren't actively rotting away.
---
Yeah hunters are 80-120g an hour or more of you're doing 4 runs per hour. (Which takes a while to learn)
---
I agree, I rolled on a pve. People say that faction imbalances might be the problem but iirc faction imbalances was a thing back in the day. I will never understand though why while you are given a choice someone would prefer to follow the masses and then come here in this sub and moan.
---
How much did you play per day?
---
I must admit I was mostly distracted by the Tauren in robes with Sulfuras on his back.
---
Depends. I work from home myself so when I was looking to get my epic mount I'd log in, park myself in IF and every 5 minutes or so tab in/advertise lockpicking and tell people just to open a trade. I'd hear the trade window opening, tab back, unlock, back to work. People tipped pretty well, especially as so many rogues never leveled their picking above 200.
---
I was only making 40-50g a day but it required very little of my time and was the next best thing to passive income. Any other gold farming method I actually have to focus on the game so I couldn't do it during business hours.
---
TRUEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yea. I probably wont play until battlegrounds. I'm considering character transfer, but still debating.
---
Clearly you nothing else to add to this conversation, have fun out there man.
---
Be undead
---
I'm not complaining.
---
I come pre-trammel UO, AC:DT, SB, Darkfall, games that were open world FFA PvP with either full loot, or limited loot.
---
I'm stating a fact about less resilient players. My concern is for server health, not epeening. If we wanna epeen. I made the Goons quit Darkfall, not intentionally, just as a matter of using a 100 man alliance to defeat their 4k man alliance in a couple of sieges. The alliance disbanded, and the majority of their players quit. It was bad for the server, and in many ways ultimately killed the game. That's not good for anyone.
---
I think it's fun.  Gangs will roll up on you and kill you.  It happens.  The next time you see somebody from the other faction, you kill them.  Goes around comes around.

Hey bloodfang right? Done some pugs with Sauna, they are all super nice dudes, chill and friendly in the discord and accommodating to outsiders.
---
Yeaaaa about soulbound.. well.. lot of babyragers in dungeons lets put it that way. Not all of course but I have experience quite a few :(
---
Horde is playing with handicaps, it’s been that way since the beginning.  Better racials and numbers.  It’s too bad if you didn’t know this unfortunately, but playing alliance has always been for the less min maxing players.
---
Hey, I made a few fixes related to new installs - please update and try again.
---
I'm not familiar with the shaman but I'm also in invictus. I raid with one of they're many raid teams :)
---
Hey, I believe this error shows for new users and was fixed. Try updating from Curse
---
Yeah - especially those opening weeks really drove home the absolute GENOCIDE waged against the Kobolds in Elwynn and Quillboar in Durotar.
---
Please outline:
---
1. What classic wow is “supposed” to be
---
2. In what world is a change to queues enforcing factionbalamce on the server in anyway comparable to retail
---
I agree but as long as it exists for anyone it’s silly to give it up, only gimping yourself. Yes it’s a tool for hunting people down and griefing but it’s also a tool for alerting you to people who are known for griefing. “Boycotting” is like saying “I hate gankers so I refuse to use any abilities when they gank me”
---
Honestly the biggest issue is that is spots people there would be no possible way to spot just because of data that comes through. I do wonder if Bliz could just clamp down on the combat log range for anyone not in party or shared instance
---
For those who are now speed running MC I think so too especially when some might start flasking at this point and those same people already probably have tons of experience with bwl but it won’t always be about half the guilds who recently cleared Mc will probably take a whiks to clear bwl as well
---
Might be a dumb question but how do I find the statistic button?
---
maybe 2x if he plays only during the nights, it's going to be 5 times as long if he plays on normal times
---
Even if you only dungeon farm and somewhat remove the pvp aspect you will still have to corpse run to whatever dungeon you choose for the day and then wait for replacements every time someone drops out
---
I was just helping friends do rend runs being a resto shaman. 
---
Briarwood dropped and I literally got it just for off spec coz there were no other casters in the group. 
---
I hear people running it so much praying for it to drop. I got it not even looking for it.
---
Something to do with Latency?
---
Maybe you have higher MS than them?
---
No clue if thats the thing but worth looking into imo :)
---
You do realise similar addons were in the game in original classic...???
---
I thought jumping out the window in BRM to zone into MC was a joke to get people to jump in the lava. Confirmed yesterday that it indeed ports you into MC so you don’t have to worry about clicking the NPC when there’s a whole raid stacked.
---
If a warrior dies, it's always a healer issue. Where were his healers??
---
it has nothing to do with how powerful your computer is
---
watching your guy go from a plain looking person to over time acquiring gear to make you look badass is rewarding to me imho
---
Yeah, "fuck you for picking the faction you liked, go start over."
---
This sub is so toxic, y'all act like wow classic is all about the community, but will lash out at eachother at every disagreement.
---
Why is it fair that a person who has never had to wait to play the game that they pay for because the picked a server with no queues to now have to wait or restart their progress of their character or leave all their friends behind?
---
Faction based queues are not fair if they're introduced half way into a servers life, you cut people out of the game only because they picked the faction they liked.
---
You're remembering the wrong game then. 
---
Realm populations are triple the size it was back in vanilla WoW. There are way more min/maxxers and way more lvl 60s at this current state when compared to the same state in original vanilla WoW. Which means all these extra hundreds of lvl 60s are spread out, making the game quite unplayable for the side that is heavily biased.
---
&gt;Most of the zoomers born in the late 90's/early 2000s are from early 80s millennials, because yes most people have kids in their early 20s. 
---
So late 90s... People have kids in their 20s. Millennials are early 80s (about 1983 ish). 1983 + 20 (at the earliest) = 2003. Halfway through the zoomer gen if not later . Even the earliest millennial definitions are 1981 so + 20 = 2001. Elementary addition is apparently hard to someone who throws around the word logic...
---
&gt;Boomers born in the early 40s gave birth to the gen xers, and yes some of the boomers in the early 60s had some millenial children. 
---
Boomers weren't early 40s... They were late 40s. World War 2 ended in 1945 and the period of prosperity that followed was the "baby boom" of increased birth rates since there was an obvious slump in births during the Great Depression of the 30s and WWII of the late 30s and early 40s.
---
&gt;The kids who adopt the "okboomer" thing are usually teenagers born from 80s millennials. Most gen Xers gave birth to 90s millennials. 
---
Yeah the early Gen Xers gave birth to the 90s millennials, but a majority of the millennial generation was the 80s... So no shit there's overlap nor totally agreed upon start/ends to a generation except Boomers which were specifically after the end of WWII which you were wrong about (not the early 40s). By and large the majority of baby boomers gave birth to the majority of millennials, a majority of Gen Xers gave birth to a majority of zoomers. 
---
 &gt;Don't @ me.
---
No, I think I will you pompous ass. Hi I'm /u/tehgama95 and I can't do basic math in my own posts, I don't know why the baby boomer generation started, and don't know when WWII ended.
---
Holla atcha boiiiiii
---
So... Tldr: pvp happened on a pvp server. Gj bro. QQ more. Just makes all the Horde dump trucking you happier lol.
---
It was the same in vanilla. Although sometimes people paying for Chinese honor farm could out farm.
---
This tbh. Would like to see a merge of all servers for more pvp fun *sarcasm off*
---
Yeah, it's bloodfang. Glad to hear you have good experiences, soulbound seems to be a big guild so suppose they fit more _interesting_ people as well, but most people from the guild were reasonable :)
---
As paladin I can nearly relate. Never had I used my bubblehearth macro this much.
---
As a lore nerd, I didn’t mind the numerous inaccuracies. It was just fun to see Azeroth on the big screen.
---
You won’t if you’re on your way to MC with 39 guildies though.
---
Holy shit mages do pwn!
---
No shit, have subs are fucking toxic. I hate people on Reddit. I'm having a lot of fun with open world PvP.
---
I mean everyones circumstances is different, going off those that only play a few hours a day. Wiping on stupid shit would be a huge waste of time, thats worth getting mad about imo.
---
Wasn't it Magatha "evil  tauren" grimtotem that advocated for them?
---
These guys cant even figure out keyring and you think they're gonna get battlegrounds early?
---
A city raid with possible civilian dishonorable kills is too dangerous
---
Here I was feeling decent about 2k honor lmaooo
---
&gt;I will never understand though why while you are given a choice someone would prefer to follow the masses and then come here in this sub and moan.
---
This has been my biggest issue with the complaints, all of these things were present in vanilla, but people's nostalgia goggles conveniently ignore it. Soutshore/TM was a bloodbath and it was rare that the Flight Master was ever alive (I killed flight masters whenever possible), BRM would be camped and raids would wipe just trying to reach the entrance. At times even random spots like WPL/Ashenvale/Arathi would become a pure bloodbath so this is nothing new, but the extreme amount of complaining I've seen is brand new. 
---
The worst part is people act like being told to roll on a PvE server is some sort of huge insult, the ruleset is designed for players that want to PvP only when they want, while PvP servers are designed for any contested zone to turn into a potential slaughter. This is something made very clear and for players that enjoy the real PvP experience it's what they want. 
---
Meanwhile the people that roll on PvP servers and expect that they can always safely reach their quest/instance are surprised when a 40 man raid camps them, then come on the sub and create a few dozen threads about how it's unfair or "iTs NoT rEaL pVP"
---
Lmao this is me. The butthurt is so strong with Alliance pvpers right now. It's hilarious.
---
I dunno, it might compete with this one quite equally 
---
* Bring your friends to Azeroth, but don't forget to go outside Azeroth with them as well.
---
The highest honor people on my server are all rogues who gank in the other factions cities. People feel really safe in ironforge, but you’ll die anywhere outside the busy areas here.
---
*laughs using gouge, restorative potion, vanish, and preparation* 
---
Jokes aside y'all put up a good fight and frankly scare me
---
Yeah, go to Stalagg alliance and tell me again about how "both sides are literally the same shit".
---
Don’t read this as combative. 
---
So you said that it was just like this (it wasn’t I was there) then spent 3 more paragraphs explaining how players are fundamentally different. You also didn’t mention the massive population increase per server, which means the PPA (Player Per Acre) is orders of magnitude higher.
---
In Vanilla Classic I would be able to “go somewhere else” if a particular block was too hot, that is not a viable thing in Classic at the moment. 
---
The rule set was the same, but the whole of the rest of it is vastly different. The result is this is not a viable play experience for anyone not already playing a 60. 
---
I hope something changes soon.
---
Man you must have some REALLY low standards. So low they must be same in your every day life. World pvp is a lag fest of AOE blizzards and ROF. No skill. Just hwo can throw more bodies. Not sure how anyone can enjoy people teleporting around and lagging out of this world. It's so shit, it has made me dislike people who say it is good. That's how fucking tragic the lag is.
---
You really think people will just abandon their horde characters that they have put hundreds of hours on to start fresh on Alliance?
---
I said there would still be more Horde than Alliance even with limits to character creation on certain servers. Which doesn't solve the problem of unbalanced servers today. 
---
Then you replied with, "Yup, horde."
---
If, hypothetically, people did realize this from the beginning, there'd only be pvp servers with 100% horde or 100% alliance. If I, a priori, admitted to the fact that there would be faction imbalance and there was no way to fix this, I wouldn't be rolling alliance on my current server. Or roll pve of course. Not trying to claim that we couldn't have seen this coming, but I'd rather be Blissfully ignorant and hope it will work out fine. 
---
Additionally, there is a problem now. One can blame the players for being shortsighted. Or blizz can attempt to fix the actual issue at hand. Why are you against this. Wouldn't it be more fun for you as well to play on a server which has balanced pop? Don't you think this will lead people of the lesser faction to quit/transfer? Further increasing the imbalance?
---
Wow, some people like the thing and other people do not like the thing. That is absolutely hilarious.
---
Leveling up it wont be too considerable, put abilities like dash range from 40% to 80% speed. Best pets to level with are owls and boars imo. Dont travel for an hour just to get a new skill, but if you're in the area and level range then consider it
---
Oh yeah for sure, but we usually organize a run with several other guilds and wipe out hordes on our way with limited casualties. When I'm doing business myself I just log.
---
Real time HP/Mana updates are sent through the advanced combat log (not the combat log in chat). Beyond the combat log's range updates come at a much slower rate, you can no longer see buff/debuff timers, ect. 30 yards is literally less than most caster's max range.
---
What does this look like in your head? Like a mage 60 yards is casting on a boar. What do I see? What you're suggesting seems to fundamentally change the game.
---
I feel like this is the fairest way you could deal with this problem tbh if you are trying to adhere at least loosely to no changes while aknowledging the rampant problem. Camping vital chokepoints and resources is sort of expected I think. But when you can't travel anywhere in the open world without being camped continually and reliably, I think you have to realize that population filling up and creating that much dangerous ground makes the game largely unplayable for anyone not just grouping up to pvp (and god forbid if you are the ally anywhere but like heartseeker and trying this). Just because people rolled on pvp servers doesnt mean they want to constantly pvp.
---
Personally, yeah I'd say leveling is rewarding. I'm not going to claim that every single quest or dungeon will tickle your fancy (a lot of the kill x of y, etc quests are pretty boring), but there are definitely some fun quests to do and some cool items to get and play around with along the way. I didn't get attached to some gear I only had for a couple of levels, but I definitely did get attached to some things that lasted me 10+ levels at which point any upgrade likely will feel really noticeable compared to something incremental like going from 5 strength to 6 strength. As far as I understand it, some quests offer weird gear or items that are ONLY available from that quest, with alternatives either not really existing or otherwise potentially being far off or locked behind something specific. You can sort of powerlevel professions, but you're hardcapped by your character level for part of it, and it'll be tough to get the materials for the final stretch unless you either buy it all or are close to the character level it's meant to represent.
---
I recently hit max level and at least for now I significantly look forward to playing my level 20ish alts way more than my currently one level 60. There are definitely "things to do" at level 60, a big one being finally getting the epic mount and gear that will last me indefinitely, but personally I think I just much prefer unlocking new abilities and messing around with different playstyles and professions on alts than I do high level stuff like grinding for a low droprate item from some dungeon or grinding reputation for some unlock that's theoretically supposed to be worth it. It's also possible I'll enjoy level 60 more when battlegrounds hit, and it's also possible that maybe I just don't really like the class my first level 60 was and I might feel much happier getting something else leveled to that point of progress.
---
Morgan's Vigil is a deathtrap on Mograine-EU like 75% of the time. And I'm pretty sure it was the same group of people on different days.
---
They always start by having the Priest MC you and attack Alliance NPCs there. There's also a shaman whose name I remember seeing on multiple occasions - Dad.
---
Whitemane? lol. "U R a dOrK"
---
You made a decision in full knowledge of the consequences. Children have been ganking people 'unfairly' in retail for 15 years. 
---
Why should anyone feel sorry for your '100 hours' when you knew what you were getting in to?
---
Reroll. It's just a game.
---
Well it's 100% blizzards fault so.
---

Stop questing and do Dungeons
---
He didn’t mention a Druid though
---
it's information readily available in the combat log and many mods use it. don't get upset that people make add-ons to parse it, similar addons have been in the game extremely long as well- like gladius and various bg addons.
---
are you going to break all of those as well because you got spanked in wpvp and want to find excuses to blame- besides yourself and finding a group?
---
Title is missing the key part of the joke, "Tip". It's fully possible to misunderstand if you read it in a jiffy.
---
Yeah I guess, but I'm sure that once the initial setup is all sorted out they quite likely have things fairly down pat. If they're a serious multiboxer I'd guess a whole lot of it is automated for one.
---
I mean I'll assume that they have the actual mechanics for inviting/summoning/etc fairly down pat and that it's as hands off as possible.  Then I'll assume that each warlock has 24 slot shard bags you're looking at 112 summons each before they run out... that's 336g+ per warlock.
---
Then what I would do is keep one warlock and some clickers somewhere that's great for farming shards quickly and easily. That way you have a warlock fully loaded and ready to go - do a summon exchange with whatever lock has run out of shards and switch them over, farm new shards on the lock with low numbers and you're done.
---
I think it would require a fair bit of planning but if done right then it should be fairly hands off most of the time and the only actual "farming" you do becomes getting low level shards.
---
On my server, alliance is the most populous
---
I'm not arguing that there isn't any impact.  I'm arguing that this was always possible during phase 1.  And in some cases, was realized.  Phase 2 didn't change mechanics.  It just gave more incentive to pvp.  That's not a change to the game itself.  It's a change in player behavior.  Amplified due to the high population count.
---
Smolderweb
---
What made you the kinda dumb that you are?
---
I've been in the south corner of Sithilis grinding mobs and the fuckers still find me
---
On my server the goldfarmers have a literal guild where they just run around the main cities without having to spam anything.
---
I saw a bot farming an area where I reported them every day for two weeks before I stopped seeing them.
---
I still see names like chokeawhor, smackabetch
---
Moderation has greatly gone downhill. I still report but I don't think Activision cares to give blizz the manpower it needs.
---
:(
---
Yeah this is very true.
---
Particularly as it’s an efficient honour farm to camp dungeons as you get a rotating cast of players coming through. World pvp is a zone against other pvp groups gives diminishing returns
---
&gt; that a dangerous and unpredictable world is precisely what draws some people to PvP servers
---
Exactly, I think more people like pvp than pvp servers. There's a bit of a difference. Those servers are for a niche style that few people genuinely seem to like. If they want more "fair fights" I don't understand why they didn't go pve. Pvp means you're up for grabs at any moment. When I played on a pvp server in BC Alliance ganking put the Hell in Hellfire Peninsula, constantly camping Honor Hold FP and I don't remember "unbalanced" factions being the reason why. Servers are bound to be unbalanced, that's a given, especially at this point in time. I know it's frustrating but... come on.
---
Fucking hate you bitchy healers
---
is this a copypasta
---
When will people finally realize that these are generally NOT the same people. Reddit is not one person.
---
Not true at all. I’m on horde dominated Kurinnaxx as an alliance hunter and I’m loving the world pvp. I’m farming honor as a small rolling death squad with friends and yeah we get outnumbered a lot but it’s still fun BECAUSE ITS A VIDEO GAME. Everyone that rolled on a pvp server knew what they were signing up for yet they still bitch and complain about pvp happening.
---
No fuck that whole go to pve shit! Killing low levels as a geared 60 then say that to them. That's just griefing honestly
---
I would say so, its not undoable, I've done over 80 kills without imp FD, but for consistencys sake, I would take imp fd
---
Which is ?
---
Ty
---
I'm aware which is why I left a disclaimer at the beginning of the comment. 
---
Still, it is a decent sample size. The numbers will be biased towards a certain population, yet it's still something.
---
That's the point of world pvp! Wtf..... Greifing the other faction and getting hk's. Zoomers will never understand, they want participation trophies instead of getting better, being tactical, and stopping the other faction.
---
Why are people surprised by this?  Lol.
---
Go ahead go to the entrance of brd or even the door of blackrock mountain. You cant even enter the fucking dungeon without being ganked to death for about 45 minutes
---
Haha.  For one I don't get spanked.  I use the addon because it's a must.  Why would I handicap myself?  I feel worse for the casuals that don't even know it exists.
---
Second, you can't act like this was common place in vanilla which many people here falsely have.
---
I feel like most of you are so dependent on it for situational awareness you can't handle the thought of the playing the game as intended with a level playing field.
---
Yup. PvP servers aren't worth the hassle for the most part, it's mostly just a 60 shitting on 20s because they're trash at the game and get wrecked in BGs.
---
That is actually hilarious
---
If they don't release all 3 I'll be sad. AB is most people's favorite.
---
Also, Alterac Valley barely counts as PVP anyways.
---
No. "Actual classic" was called just WoW.  It's called Vanilla now.
---
Ohh that’s pretty cool, Alliance here too and we do something similar, we send a guy first while we’re preparing in SW then we go after he arrives to let us know what to expect.
---
Why should anyone care about letting players pay for their own mistakes then? Regardless of whether you let them transfer or not they're not going to play on a PvP server if they're miserable. At least give them the option to continue to enjoy the game.
---
Regeringen! :)
---
I’ve been having an absolute blast reading this Reddit now and then while being out of town. Looking forward to be able to play again
---
Wowpedia says it was Hamuul, just here: Sylvanas Windrunner sent emissaries to various factions in search of allies. The kind-hearted tauren of Thunder Bluff proved to be the most promising contact. Specifically, Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem, striving for diplomacy, saw the potential for redemption in Sylvanas’ people, even though he was fully aware of the Forsaken's sinister nature. Thus, the tauren convinced Warchief Thrall, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde.
---
However, Magatha did have more to do with the Forsaken than seemingly any other Tauren: For reasons known only to herself, Magatha gave more aid to the Forsaken than to other high-ranking tauren such as Cairne Bloodhoof or Hamuul Runetotem. This included arguing on their behalf when the idea of forming an alliance with them was first suggested. Ostensibly she's helped them and continues to work closely with them because she feels the tauren and their ways can help the Forsaken find a path back to being human.
---
The way I saw this was that they both advocated for the Forsaken, Hamuul because he's a cool guy and wanted to help with their redemption, and Magatha because she's evil and figured the Forsaken were her kind of people, but obviously she'd pretend to just agree with Hamuul.
---
Rogue is also the most bugged class in Vanilla rn :)
---
Its not really fixable.

---
Retail has been slowly murdered by death of a thousand cuts of this is incovinent to me, remove it from the game.
---
Trying to get into dire maul yesterday I died 4 times, 30v1. Its shit, but I got past them did my dm runs, then decided to join the raid to hunt them down and I chased them across 4 zones.
---
Pve servers are what anyone complaining about this should be playing on. If you only want pvp in battlegrounds it's still possible. World of warcraft is a world at war again. If they added xp fr
---
Or lower levels itd be fine
---
I actually rolled on a PVE server because I wanted to avoid this, but then all my friends rolled on a PVP server and convinced me to reroll... Now i'm the one roaming around looking for fights and my friends are sitting in org trying to avoid the gank squads.
---
If there wasn't such a ridiculous stigma about people whole rolled pve servers it wouldn't be a huge deal.
---
This inclination is evidence of great game design
---
What if I find myself in the stormwind AH, but didn’t dance when during the path in, what would be the ratio then? :D
---
The kill on sight list is good. You can save someone who greifs you onto your KOS list so when you get big and strong, happen upon them, you can pay them back in force. 
---
Other than that, I think it can pull data from others with Spy (not confirmed, I just heard someone else talking about that)
---
It's really not a big deal. Give it a download, see for yourself before just taking what reddit has to say. I had it long before these posts started popping up and thought it was great.
---
It's so freaking stupid. If only the killing blow nets the DK it wouldn't be so bad.
---
Cry more
---
Smaller servers likely wont "die out". Medium pop servers are way more populated than the largest servers back in vanilla. Everyone is so worried about low populations but the best memories and times they had were on servers way smaller than they are now. If you go on any of them I'd bet you have an easy time finding anything. Definitely better than seeing 20 people farming the same thing you need everywhere you go
---
Just rerolled Horde on Heartseeker. It's Alliance dominated but from my understanding, Horde from other servers with long queues are transferring over.
---
just install a threat meter and relax on the dps output when you’re pulling too much
---
Looks like a Shadow Priest vs a Resto Shaman. I think everyone may already know the outcome even without watching this.
---
I remember my very first BoE drop being The Black Knight. Not a great weapon, but a fast one which is good for tanking, and I was doing that on my warrior a lot. Not only did the hunter need and win, but the rest of the party congratulated him for obtaining it.
---
If you play without threatmeter you are doing it wrong
---
That's great for you. That doesn't fix the fact that there are players not enjoying their choice to be on a pvp server. Let them pay for their own mistakes and let them transfer off.
---
No need to quit just because you cant compete with the top 1%, that's a bit ridiculous. There are still several people in my guild not even 60 yet who dont just quit because they didnt make it fast enough. As long as you still have fun playing the hours you get, then it's worth it
---
How is it half-assed?  How could you control this?
---
Oh man those were the most fun even with dishonorable kills.
---
Definitely need to install a threat meter no matter what. I’m pretty sure rag reduces the threat of the the players he knocks back during AoEs which includes tanks.
---
That is genius
---
Energy ticks giving you 19 or 21 energy, vanish not working, cheap shot not working on people who are stunned by the gnomish rocket helmet, people attacking you out of *stealth* like a full second after you click the button, stealth menu taking way longer than intended to get brought up after you vanish
---
I was being facetious but this is a good response.
---
Nope. No regrets here.
---
I doubt it but i will check. In game it shows 30ms and green. I have 1GBit and other FPS games have no issues. Still I doubt that I have the best connection/routing to WoW realms but neither do my mates. Unless someone can explain the out of combat mechanic I would consider network lag as a factor.
---
Things were great before honor. Players don't need an added incentive to kill enemies. Creating an incentive to spawn camp is awful.
---
The fucking irony dude. Cry somewhere else. The guy you replied to was telling someone to kill themselves and you call people on a video game "bullies"
---
Just get good.  it's not a single player game.  Or roll on pve server.  You literally chose to be on a pvp server.
---
Warning though I play on a microwave
---
Fuck you and your "fun" killing people trying to play the game
---
This is me. I love this game, but have not had time to hit 60 yet. I was planning a big session this weekend but it was absolutely impossible to do anything.
---
Good for you.
---
2 weeks till they give us WSG..
---
nice ty
---
is your brain incapable of to understand that blizzards fuck up made the situation worse? 
---
we get it, you pickd your side and you are arguing based on your emotions. well done.
---
Back in the day it was much easier to avoid / dodge wpvp if needed, because server weren't overcrowded. You could always hide anywhere. But with 5x the population there is not much space left and zones too small / werent intended to hold so many players.
---
Solution is to cut the max population of all server to its vanilla max capacity. Problem solved. ;)
---
blizzard is just like the guy who is never at fault nor responsible for anything according to some users.
---
Man, you really need to get better at reading comprehension. I get that you play retail but my point about server crashes isn’t that it’s a reason why people should play, but that it highlights how active and involved the community and population is. How did you not pick that up?
---
I don't think that Vanilla pvp was over romantisized. I think the way people play Wow as an MMO has changed to the point where we won't get the same experience.
---
I remember being ganked in vanilla for sure. But I also remember a lot of fair fights as I lvled because a lot of people didn't play the game the way it's been set up with all the expansions (get to end game and get as geared as possible through pvp or pve). Also at least for my realm server pop is way higher than when I played classic so much more chance of being ganked and a lot more hordes of 60s ganking. 
---
It'll die down as p2 goes on and new phases are released. Either wait it out or reroll.
---
Kind of a weird fetish but I developed a thing for female Tauren over the years so I can't judge.
---
With imp mend pet you can dispel almost any negative effect on your pet. I use rank 1 mend pet a lot for this purpose
---
I do feel bad about alliance players and as a horde player I have been thinking twice about ganking lowbies and as of late have been leaving them be because it has to suck wanting to just play the game.  Not their fault there is faction imba.
---
I agree.  
---
There are many interesting launch options that would be cool to try.  What about having all raids available from day 1? 
---
How long would it take the best guilds to clear all content?
---
Sometimes it is https://youtu.be/reTyW92PLq4
---
People farming BGs netting 200k+ honor per week ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
this is the first week but I'm probably not going to do it every week since I don't wanna waste the money since I don't wanna damage my health grinding for r13 or r14
---
Shouldnt have rolled on a PVP server, fuck all your crying bitches.
---
You had literally months to transfer to a server that had a higher population than the highest population Vanilla servers.  Medium servers today are significantly larger than Full servers in Vanilla. You could have transferred (still can if your server isn’t horribly skewed A/H).
---
So shift the communication of certain things to the methods used by blizzard for the information they currently don't let us see. Create two combat logs.. one for NPCs and players within a certain range (I would actually say 20 yards to keep within the limits set by nameplates), and one for players outside that range. Don't allow players/addons to view the second log.
---
I'm not sitting down here to lay out the perfect development solution, I don't have enough information for that - but as someone who's been in the industry of fixing shit like this for the last couple decades I can promise you that there are ways to solve this. People declaring it "can't be done" because "the combat log" have zero idea what they are talking about.
---
These addons have a *major* impact on how PvP works and completely negates entire class abilities like stealth, makes tracking abilities pointless, and removes a substantial amount of skill from encounters such as using terrain and otherwise being aware of your surroundings.
---
It 100% can be solved, people saying it can't have no idea what they're talking about. Whether blizzard will or not is another matter.
---
So you mean the alliance hadn't done the same? Fuck you sir.
---
No, this is a valid reply to this reddit circlejerk.
---
I've been having a lot of fun in menethil harbor.
---
Strongly considering waiting out my 1.5 levels rested on my 52 warrior. Too easy pickings for most classes my level and can’t contribute to gank squads.  Not quite high enough to start the BIS grind with BRD. Kinda just feel like leveling what will be a good solo farming class like mage/lock/hunt for instance farming or open world survivability in the mean time while accruing rested
---
I'm pointing out that even against raid/tier geared people that shadow priest is competitive, in this phase, but requires use of Major Mana/Runes+buffs to keep up on certain fights.
---
I'm putting in effort to ensure I have enough consumables to maximize my DPS while maximizing mana usage per fight. One a single target fight IE: Patchwerk, I'll obviously be competing harder to match against melee/ranged instead of on Sulfurion Harbinger which has more adds for me to dot/swap DPS too faster over the melee classes. 
---
I was told Shadow priest was trash in PVE and so far my experience has been near opposite. I do drink more and require some ramp up but I make out quite well in my groups even as a offheal/resser/buffs.
---
It'd only be me blasting my guild If I claimed their all shit because I do more DMG, as spriest, if I still followed what private server people have told me. Me consistently being top ten was a brag as people have said, I'd be doing shit in Raids as a spriest.
---
You shouldn’t be above competent warriors, rogues, or hunters. But it doesn’t matter since MC is easy anyway. Shadow priests are always useful for the shadow damage debuff.
---
&gt;I was usually around the top of the damage meter but not putting out crazy high damage or anything.
---
Basically you are outputting a lot of damage and not watching your threat, while other classes have abilities to mitigate threat while maintaining damage, a DPS warrior will quickly rise to the top of the threat charts.
---
Install a threat meter, or wait a few more moments before engaging.
---
The point is simple: this happens on pvp servers. I dunno what else to tell you. It sucks and it's why I chose to spend my subscription wisely. People don't play fair and Blizzard isn't going to change an aspect of their game when they give you clear options to not have this experience.
---
If classic+ happens Blizz should do this.
---
Fix classes by using items to fix their flaws.
---
Boomkins is a helmet like that, that allows you to attach 2 mana pots to it and it'll increase you mana regen rate substantially.
---
The initial setup, farming shards, logging chars and advertising is all an opportunity cost, not to mention having to pay for 3 accounts just to be able to do it.
---
Of course, they'll be using those 3 accounts for other purposes, but either you're logged in all the time with those summoning accounts and missing the opportunity to multi-box farm, or you're multi-box farming at the same time as summons, which means switching all your accounts to your summoning chars - and for what? 3g? You'd make more than 3g just continuing to farm.
---
I'm actually not sure how this is ever more profitable than just multi-box farming. It's much better just to stay farming dungeons with your chars. Switching isn't worth the time at that price.
---
The only way this works is if you get non-stop requests for summons and could stand doing nothing more than char switching all day, and after you're fine going out to farm 48 shards for 7 warlocks.
---
*drums intensify*
---
Lol they did expect this. Why do you think they rolled Horde?  Not for the storyline or RPing LOL.
---
Ok
---
Horde have the best pvp racials? Dwarf hunters gonna rock your socks.
---
What's the issue with Spy? Want to better hide your gank squad?
---
I’ve been finding really isolated grinding spots.  In alliance and see some horde and we’re all traumatized.  Running from each other, dropping flairs to drink etc .  Working ok just boring a shame I can’t quest
---
Did you choose a pvp server? Did pvp happen? Surprised Pikachu?
---
yea lets blame blizzard for FORCING people to pick horde
---
Seriously
---
&gt; running into premades will be common but it won't be the same premade every time
---
That won't matter. The semi-organized premades will still stomp everyone else. 
---
And to make the complaining even worse, you can double your BG honor by just graveyard farming for a bit.
---
My favorite is the safe spotting arguement.
---
"Well it was allowed in vanilla! #nochanges"
---
Funny because this blue post from 2005 says otherwise...
---
It's sustainable damage, they do good damaged for a couple minutes then go out of mana. So dungeons aren't that big of a deal but raid bosses that might take awhile can be hell. Everything is so easy right now though that it probably doesn't matter too much.
---
You don't have his last location. The icons that show on the map are *your* location when the addon spotted them.
---
Edit: here's proof for your pea-sized redditor brain https://github.com/notquin69/Quins-Classic-Addons/blob/af7c6fb58102478b600d8caf9f545f01740aceb5/Spy/List.lua#L289
---
Seems like he hates whites
---
you can apply that same logic to basically every mod, including ones for raiding and auction house. should we get mad that people are able to youtube how to do raid fights too rather than go in completely clueless if they've never done it? Maybe we can go back to wandering around and spamming general for help with quests and pretend wowhead isn't here, too? Oh, and forget about BiS lists or how to get the correct stats right, since most people didn't understand that either.
---
Real good point you've got there.
---
The fact of the matter is that this game isn't vanilla, it's classic. everyone has access to this knowledge and tools. It's not going to go away unless they break many other addons. Complaining about it is just cluttering up this board.
---
I'm okay with that. I don't care about wpvp.
---
The reason people didn't need stats back then was because nobody but the most informed and elite players cared.
---
so? it aint my fault people couldnt level to 60 in time
---
"Mine" hehehe, you made me giggle dammit.
---
Early days of classic I made a small amount of money buying stuff on AH and selling to vendor... people genuinely put up items below vendor prices.
---
OP walks into a vacuum cleaner shop, looks around and says to the cashier:
---
"Hey how many vacuum cleaners do you need man!"
---
If only alliance were as good as they complain. It's also cross realm BGs so I doubt the queues will be that bad and if they are I'll just continue farming alliance until the queue pops it's easy.
---
I got to level 20 on a PvP server and was like "wait a minute, I know how this ends". Currently cruising through my 50s trouble-free. I'm a slow leveller due to time constraints, so this was the best decision I made in the game so far.
---
let us play cross-faction in the future! just repeat the retail mistakes and destroy realm identity again.
---
honestly speaking, there is a reason we dont get any official numbers, would be bad if we had facts to point out how bad the situation is or more information to give better feedback/make better decision.
---
the current situation gives them an amazing opportunity to cash on realm transfers later if people are still invested in their characters. they will do the bare minimum and pretend to care about this problem like always.
---
&gt;And if your advice is that they should leave the server then clearly you agree with me and the other guy that they dont have a chance.
---
&gt;Not sure what his class has to do with this.
---
Shaman can't be on the alliance! He's on the horde! That's why he DOES have a chance.
---
How on earth do you not understand that?
---
I can't beleive how fucking shit the pvp lag fest has been. Who the fuck thinks joining a raid of 40 and spaming AOE is fun? There is no skill. Just spam AOE and teleporting around. What a dogshit game. Fuck blizzard has gone to shit. I hate my sever now. WAYYY to populated. Fuckign sucks all of my friends are here since we only had 1 option for pvp. Fuck you blizzard. Unsubbed
---
Should've rolled PvE.
---
60s camping lowbie flight paths and villages?  That was all of phase one.  When the flight Master spot is permacamped by 3 or by 40,it doesn't make any difference to a lowbie.
---
I'm not arguing that the incentive changed.  Mechanically, the game didn't.  These behaviors were always possible.  Just because people choose to do it now doesn't mean that the game has gained any flaws.  The issues from overpopulation didn't dramatically pop into existence on Thursday.  That's my point.  So the flood of "zomg Blizzard broke it, get bgs already" isn't going to solve the problem only mask it until we run out of content in whatever phase we are on.
---
You're right, we can apply that to every addon.  Which is why the API has changed over the years.  Maybe it's time for it to change again?  You can't pretend like Spy isn't a massive advantage and breaks entire mechanics of the game (stealth and line of sight namely).
---
But what if someone of them are dirty? You'd need to stop and wash them first? Better to have spares.
---
So I've only ever played Horde, ever, until last week I made a Human Paladin. I just did this quest yesterday morning, and I'm glad I didn't see this art beforehand because I most likely would not have done it lol
---
&gt; via what is actually scripting.
---
In that way is it "actually scripting"
---
300iq
---
They aren't murdering, they're recruiting.
---
Should have played on a PVE server.
---
You're assuming a lot though - for one I'm guessing a substantial amount of what they're doing is automated. I certainly would have it be, though how in line that ends up being with the ToS I don't really know. 
---
End of the day, it works for the guy doing it and they provide a nice service. Perhaps they simply enjoy it as a fun project, working to get a player taxi service established.
---
I mean, if someone warns me over and over that the hole is 20 feet deep, and I keep insisting it’s only gonna be 3 feet deep, when it is actually 20 ft deep and I complain about it, I kinda can expect an I told you so.
---
It really does. The mobs are all too easy, there's no danger ftom mobs out in the world. You gotta keep your head on a swivel now though for other players. It's dangerous out there now.
---
Thank you. I like playing with a constant awareness that someone could roll through and murder me. Keeps me on my toes and keeps the world actually feeling dangerous. Btw I am a 44 orc rogue so I'm not on the side of the screen murdering people. I'm also very good at escape so I dont get camped myself.
---
I do feel bad for the people that get camped, killed by level ??s or ganged up on which appears to be a rampant complaint.
---
I'm only level 39 so I'm still in the grind. 
---
But I've stopped mind controlling and buffing alliance players with fortitude since P2 started.
---
Now I just hit Fear and anybody who runs back to me gets lit up, as I continue the grind.
---
That's what he was saying, your guild is shit if you're top 10. I'm not agreeing, but he was saying that, regardless of the effort you're putting in.
---
Best phase, ever !
---
The world pvp is so god damn fun !
---
 Trying to enjoy it as much as I can because knowing blizzard they will rush bg’s cus all the whining in the forums.
---
I mean, the same people who whined their ass off and made wow what it is today (the shitshow bfa is) are now whining yet again and trying to make blizzard rush phases.
---
I never saw it confirmed anywhere that Blizzard actually lets more people *online* on any given server than in Vanilla, just that more people have made characters on each server. If anyone has a link that displays where they announced that Classic was going to have "3 times more people online simultaneously than in Vanilla", I'd like to see it. Unless you mean population caps on the servers themselves, which I don't recall ever existing on any given server when I played back in Vanilla.
---
But it isn't the same as vanilla. 
---
Server size was not as big as this back in 1.3 vanilla. It is nearly triple. We also have a lot more lvl 60s comparatively.
---
40+ people camping FP, camping corpses, making the game literally unplayable is not wPvP.
---
People think vanilla wow was similar, but it isn't. 
---
It was about "enjoying" the journey. We had a good size of mix/maxxers,  but we have way more now. With higher pop realms, and a lot more 60s,  it means every zone turns into a shitshow, which is totally evident now.  It's a shitshow.
---
Never thought I'd say this, but
---
Mood
---
Shit, I nearly have 3 60 warriors and this isn't vanilla. Vanilla as a whole died 13 years ago.
---
I mean I've had similar ratings in multiple expansions, but that's the thing, it's assumed that if you want to roll on PVE servers you must not be into PVP or whatever.
---
In reality I just like to choose when I would like to PVP.
---
Go play on a PVE server where you belong. Stop trying to ruin the game for those of us who want this because you're being a little bitch about it. If you can't handle it either go to retail, roll on a PVE server or fucking quit.
---
Fuck off with all this whining crybaby shit.
---
99.99% of the time coords plus reading the quest in your log is absolutely all that is needed.
---
But has it reached r/pokemon levels of toxicity yet? A lot of people are pissed with the sheer number of Pokémon that were culled from Sword &amp; Shield.
---
People need to walk away and afk without ressing
---
Blizzard's stock response to people disliking pvp on pvp servers has basically always been "there is a pvp solution." I knew the game would be like this, and it is why I rolled on a pve server. I'm not some genius 5head,  I just remember how it was on vanilla and assumed a higher number of players per server would be less fun.
---
Yeah I mean, I think the people who rolled on PVP servers expecting people *not* to be assholes about it were rather naive. Being an asshole is and always has been what world PVP is all about! That's why I chose the ability to opt into it by rolling on a pve server!
---
One of the things that I might add as a qualifier is this: people who want to gank roll horde and here’s why. Horde racials are tauted as superior pvp racials. Which seems odd because paladins give alliance a huge advantage in any sort of organized PvP. So what could they possibly be referring to? Horde racials are superior for when you want to GANK someone. . Paladin doesn’t help in ganking situations other than to bubble hearth and just not be worth the time to kill for lots of classes. 
---
So the people who want to gank will roll horde. So it’s a matter of proportions, no one is saying it’s exclusively one or the other, but from the way things are upvoted we can see that more people agree with the horde being worse than the otherwise. We also have to factor in that HOrde DOMINATE most PvP servers and so even if the number of assholes on each side were equal, the opportunity to gank is much higher for the horde in relative safety.
---
and yet classic is going to go downb that same route. when people start quitting in droves blizzard is going to get involved i can almost bet u anything. they will see a massive loss of money and work around it. and it will be the fault of pvpers for running people off.
---
Is there?... Sounds exactly like open world PvP to me.
---
Try reading my post before replying to it.
---
Yeah it truly is a shitshow. That was my server before I quit :(
---
OW is literally a first person game where you shoot guns, how can it not be an FPS ?
---
Yeah.. it’s not a casual stroll through plaguelands and oh look an alliance questing let me try to kill them. It’s deep groups with at least 5 anywhere you go. Anywhere.
---
yes leave and find another guild that has MAIN RAID. dont join secondary raid.
---
Yes it can, most servers are horde dominate. However some few are Alliance dominated.
---
Not that hard my guy.
---
Then don't group with idiots?
---
So it’s not even close to accurate?
---
Should have joined a PvE server
---
Who decides if it's impressive or not? I think it is, you don't. Seems like a difference of opinion. Video is at 10 000 views now within 2 days. At what viewcount would you say that people care?
---
&gt; People declaring it "can't be done" because "the combat log" have zero idea what they are talking about.
---
What you're suggesting is a fairly large change to the current combat log. Nobody is claiming its literally impossible, but it would require changes to a system that's been more or less the same for 15 years. Solving the "problem" will break a whole bunch of current AddOns, and may even fundamentally change PvP if the range is as small as you're suggesting.
---
&gt; completely negates entire class abilities like stealth, makes tracking abilities pointless,
---
This is nonsense. Stealth is still stealth; you're still invisible. It does make tracking a bit redundant, but it's no different than making a /tar macro when you really wanted to camp somebody. 
---
If you don't see the ridiculousness of only knowing the actions of enemy players within 20 yards then I really don't know what to say. You're playing a different game than the rest of us.
---
You're playing WoW. You're wasting time no matter what you're doing. Plus dying is part of the game. It's gonna happen. No reason to let yourself get upset over it, waste of emotion.
---
PvP server... even with BGs people still do this shit
---
Run dungeons. Questing in vanilla is boring as fuck:)
---
You can grind out almost as quickly as doing quests. Sometimes much more quickly (40+)
---
Questie doesn’t really put people that far ahead. It’s just very convenient for early game.
---
How many characters actually shoot as their primary role, let alone guns?
---
&gt; There are droves of people who   
---
&gt;want  
---
&gt; 5 v 1 scenarios so they can /sit on someone and corpse camp them.
---
Just lol if you think the same people didn't exist in 2005.
---
I see
---
By ignoring the complaints of the players and not changing the game to suit the vocal minority.
---
Yeah, we didn’t have internet fame like that. Youtube videos were so rare that most of them became pretty popular at least in some circles. We also liked the videos, not the people behind them mostly.
---
Plus they didn’t have all the monetization algorithms giving exclusive promotions on the recommended page to things that would generate the most money for Google.
---
Twitch just enables and rewards stupid shit that isn’t actually rewarding to do in isolation. Poggers.
---
The problem is not WPVP at all.
---
It's the imbalance between factions.
---
That's it.
---
It is not 10x. Server cap is around 5500-6000. It was like 3500-4500 in vanilla according to forums.
---
Yep
---
Because FUCK EM, thats why
---
trinketmenu
---
"All they have" yet they are in every single zone at all times....right
---
The whiners are the reason we even have classic.
---
By complaining on the forums and on this subreddit. Look at the most upvoted post. They want to kill World PvP, because it isn't casual enough for them.
---
It gives you a target which can be marked with a raid icon which is easy to see through walls.
---
&gt; The answer to the balance problem is faction-specific queues, not transfers.
---
It's both, queues will encourage people to use the transfers.  But more importantly, they need to drastically reduce server sizes.
---
Absolute value doesn't matter.  
---
If everybody on server have more than 19k points - you would be the last one.  
---
Only thing that matter is how much honor you have relative to others.  
---
There's no cap, at the end of the week all honor would be reset and you get points based on how you are compared to other players of your faction.
---
I am kinda glad that when I hit level 60 the bgs will be here and basically the end of large scale open world pvp;) I can walk, not run into the lair of that dragon bitch by then:)
---
I wish I didn't feel obligated to roll on a PvP server but I wanted a serious raid guild and they are just so much more common on PvP realms.  Also the raid times.
---
If I could find a PvE realm with multiple serious raid guilds that raid when I can play I would really consider rerolling, not because the PvPness has been too rough but because I just don't care for it.  I always felt like PvP and the whole honor system in vanilla was garbage.
---
&gt;do you agree it would be better for pvp as a whole if the factions were balanced? Do you agree that it’s unfun and a dick move to spawn or flight master camp?
---
Of course it would be better if factions were balanced, and I never said anything about being a dick being fun. The only reason why Horde is more favored on PVP realms is because they have better PVP racials. That's it. That's why Blizzard changed them so many times over the years. When humans got Every Man for Himself, all of a sudden there were way more Alliance on PVP servers. 
---
&gt;What I suggested, and what I thought was the pretty clear implication Was that blizzard could track how a server is trending and lock character creation on a particular faction until it is within an acceptable. The point I made at the start was blizzard should have anticipated this and don’t something, whatever it was outside of game, to keep servers from becoming this imbalanced
---
I don't think this is a good idea. It would be unfair for someone not to be able to create an alt because of an artificial limit. Also prevents people from creating characters on certain servers to join friends. I understand the idea behind it but I don't believe Blizzard should do anything to balance the game, inside or out. And as far as anticipating this, I think everyone knew, even Blizzard, how unbalanced some servers get sometimes.  
---
&gt;You’re like the classic asshole apologist. Do you think it’s fun to farm people as they land defenseless? Would you enjoy being on the receiving end? Can you maybe empathize with the people dealing with that and see things from a perspective other than your own? Could you turn off your hyper defensive attitude and and agree on any of my points?
---
As far as fun goes, that is totally subjective. There are many many players who play like assholes because they can. Nothing is going to change that. I can see why people are frustrated. but at the end of the day Classic PVP is an anything goes type of environment. It's not balanced or fair because that's the design of the game. And if you start to balance things whether it be faction limits or something similar then we're getting away from Classic and moving more and more towards retail.
---
don’t roll on a pvp server then..
---
You deserve to get ganked for using Spy Mod.
---
Druid. Tank. Heal. Dps. All quite well. Groups will love you.
---
Can't upvote this enough.  All these people crying here trying to get Blizzard to change the game...  Just saying, if you picked a PvP server, you kind of made the decision, literally everyone with a damn brain knew it would be like this when honor first released.  If your here crying about it, well, that's your problem, not anyone elses.  
---
Carry on.
---
You clearly don't know shit about this game but go on blaming your inadequacies on an addon :)
---
Incendius horde here, 57 on Thursday, 59 now. It seems alliance have a slight numbers advantage or are just better organized. They seem to have control in every high level zone, but not to the point of just getting farmed everywhere I go (except BRM. Three corpse runs just to get in the front door last night. Fuck that place). 
---
That said, I've been having a blast. Random things like putting groups together to retake the gromgol zeppelin, teaming up with another 50-something to defend against a solo 60 ganker. Maybe I've been lucky, but I feel like the game is far from unplayable right now, especially on incendius.
---
tell that to any pvper....and the overcrowdedness would be one reason why they would either A,bring back layering or 2, jump start battlegrounds. if there's bgs u wont see as many people out in the world because they would beable to level safely in there.
---
Especially as a lock if you want to use that spellstone use aswell.
---
Rerolling is free.
---
I can confirm per sources (him.... he’s a friend and guildie) that he uses 4 accounts. He is a one man operation.
---
Not everyone looks up previous posts or browses often like the people who see them constantly and repeat that comment constantly but it’s okay
---
I'll pass thanks, I like having an open, breathing, dynamic world, as it should be :)
---
I said "our" classic. Not MY classic.  Cause it's not mine. It belongs to the community.  It's litteraly a gift from blizzard to it's community.  They opted for the "no change" because that's what the community wanted.
---
"You think you do but you don't" was right for people like you.  You are just not the target audience and it's fine.  Go find yourself another game. Don't try to make it something it's not.  
---
Game been out for 15 years and you still act surprise at how it works.  If you don't like the game just leave man.   
---
I don't see anyone forcing you to play.  
---
If I wasn't at work with nothing else better to do I would've stopped this argument a long time ago because you are obviously too simple and stubborn to be reasoned but yeah I'm having a blast right now.  All your previous comments on other post are about you complaining about the game and how you suck at PVP.  Stop punishing yourself by playing the game and go do something that makes you happy. Thanks me later
---
Honestly there isn’t much I can do in Wpvp. I get no honor if I am dead, and three dots(which will instantly be applied the second I try to do anything) will kill me. There aren’t any stragglers to pick off and people have an addon that tells them if I stealth within combat log range and they instantly start AOEing. 
---
Until they break through to the group there isn’t much I can do other than be free honor to them while getting no honor myself from having res sickness all the time.
---
Your point seems to be "streamers bad" and most people around here will agree with that, so idk what your point is.
---
Streamers bad. Woo. Move on.
---
No, it can't be both "all" and "most".
---
It's either all. Or it's most. People are telling me all. Now you're saying most.
---
Great goal post moving.
---
Shamans usually find their place easy
---
The time to stop is when you think you have more than the rest of your faction. The players with the most Honor get the most Ranking points at the end of the week, players with an average Honor gain will get a middling number of Ranking.
---
&gt; Some people love the things other players are crying about
---
Oh yeah I'm sure people love being corpse camped by groups of 20 for an hour plus.
---
&gt; It absolutely is. It's just not the PvP you want
---
Its more like PPPPPPPPPPPPPvP
---
&gt; You're just frustrated and venting that they're killing you when you don't want to PvP
---
I most definitely want to pvp I just want some semblance of balance to it.
---
EDIT: for reference had a 20 v 20 situation earlier and it was amazing but this 20 v 1-5 stuff is horsehit.
---
Most groups I’ve been in are lacking druids and shamans
---
In a 40 man raid with zone scanning add-ons......
---
This is toxic behavior.
---
Now that being max level, having an epic, mount, and killing onyxia are the norm players carve a new status symbol
---
I'd say vanilla wpvp and classic wpvp are two entirely different things due to the amount of players involved :/
---
but you're right I think a lot of people didn't realise this when they started on a pvp realm :)
---
Yep....and those people aren't here complaining so they aren't the target audience of what I'm saying.
---
Honestly I doubt regular people will go for the high ranks unless they are completely delusional. Because the rare pvp gear only comes in phase 6 there's very little point to go for ranks past 6 for normal players
---
how?
---
What are pros and cons to both Sword (hemo) and Dagger (backstab/ambush) pvp builds, aside from losing or gaining some talents? I was so conflicted on which I wanted to go since I'll play either in pve
---
They'll complain about getting farmed by premades in BGs all day next
---
The guy has scripts set up so when he presses one button, his 10 accounts all do something different. Hence, scripts.
---
He isn't alt tabbing between his WoW windows to accomplish this.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was automated to operate while he was AFK. Full botting.
---
'Nobody is crying', says guy crying in a thread with hundreds of others crying.
---
Can confirm. Was pvping in SS, running around with a raid. A random low level hunter was in our path. He stopped &amp; stared. I fireblasted him, and he instantly died. Feelsbadman
---
I want to make a pally somewhere else. What times do you play?
---
The Alliance who left just wanted to make their own Alliance only server. It shouldnt have been allowed to happen.
---
Idk mages feel pretty sweet at 20 
---
Shaman 30
---
I'd say leveling certainly feels how he describes
---
You probably aren’t.
---
You can farm dungeons from 18+ to 42-44 without ever stepping outside horde controlled zones, effectively playing in a pve server until halfway to 60. By the time you’re forced into contested zones, and end up in Tanaris or badlands, bgs should be out and anyone farming for honor won’t be in the open world.
---
Also, you’re horde.
---
&gt; Logical fallacy.
---
How so?

Can do Mara aoe farm
---
At that range they would be using melee tho
---
Tomorrow: "The Burning Crusade should be released early. Battlegrounds just not that exciting"
---
arcane spell with +20 arcane spellpower will do the same damage as arcane spell with +20 normal spellpower.
---
Spells have different "coefficients". "up to" means that, with the max coefficient, 1.0, it increases the damage of the spell by that number. So if you had "up to +20 spell damage" and you cast a spell with a 1.0 coefficient, it'd deal 20 more damage. 1.0 coefficients are rare, however. most are lower. Higher level spells with longer cast times usually have higher coefficients. Downranking a spell will reduce its coefficient.
---
Land/ress and be honourless target... Still get killed.
---
Yeah, this isn't about honour, people just think behaving like arseholes is okay
---
if people start quitting because of this,then blizzard;s going to get involved somehow. rather it be paid faction transfer(witch would net them more money cause lets face it,blizzard will ruin classic for the "vanilla community" if it made them more cash) 2, layering makes a return. or 3. BGs get jump started.
---
ahahahhahahahahahahah
---
sorry not everyone is crying like you, if you cant handle it just leave
---
any info on Golemagg-EU ???
---
I see a lot of posts arguing against this mod, and I tend to agree with the sentiment, but not in the way that it is often (mis) represented in this thread, and many of the others.
---
The issue with this addon isn't that it provides functionality that would otherwise be impossible.  You can do everything that this addon does all on your own.
---
The issue is that this mod obliterates the World PvP skill-floor for this game.
---
While using this mod, you can be significantly less aware of your surroundings as you roam around, and face no repercussions for doing so.  You also do not need to keep an eye on your combat log, so your ability to multitask has less of an impact on the outcome of any encounters you have.
---
So yes, I could roam around and keep one eye on my combat log to hopefully spot someone casting something, take my hand off my mouse and type /tar [name].  
---
Or I could download this mod and click a single button.
---
This addon is a crutch, and a damned effective one at that.  I believe the sour taste that is being left in the mouths of many of us is the simple fact that if you are using this addon, you are, by no merit of your own, playing on another level from those who do not.  It is 'mandatory', in many of the same ways that DBM is 'mandatory', except for the fact that it 'victimizes' (hyperbolic, I know) another human being.
---
I mean...the fact the Molten Core is so stupid easy that all of the sudden speed runs are a big deal.
---
Props to them, but I’m not sure it’s possible to be a top player atm because the game is just that easy.
---
On my realm there is a discord set up to monitor roaming gank squads in every area.
---
On friday, every questing zone had a squad in it. Every.... One...
---
This goes for both horde and alliance. The game is unplayable if you don't have 39 people backing you up.
---
Yeah druids are finite on horde-bigglesworth
---
\**Laughs in PvE server**
---
I’m quite enjoying it on my normal server (windseeker). You can find 1 off fights around the world if you’re flagged and then there’s often 20v20-40+ battles at hillsbrad. People on the server have thousands of kills from the hillsbrad battles but we’re all still able to level and get to dungeons and raids. I knew I was t cut out for a pvp server experience and am quite happy with what normal server is providing.
---
The free transfers are crap choices, btw. After a recent guild I was in fell through, all the 4-5 choices I had for transferring were ghost towns.
---
Oh look, another dipshit edgelord. Color me surprised.
---
No, it will be Blizzard's fault for releasing honor without BGs and on overcrowded servers.
---
WPvP is fun, but I have been wanting battlegrounds since day 1 haha. They’re so nice for breaking up the questing/grinding, at least in my opinion.
---
This is only true if you’re engaging in the enormous fights at like, Tarran Mill. 
---
I’ve consistently been able to find 5v6, 8v10 type battles, and they’re fun as hell. Throw in some smaller stuff (2v2, 3v3) and I have no complaints thus far.
---
Yeah but Icefrog deleted Gambler the funnest Dota hero so yanno...
---
Cool you didn't read my reply then, guess that means I can safely not bother talking to you from now on.
---
You consider eating hospital food for the rest of your entire life. You decide that wouldn't be very appetizing after a few weeks. In fact, you didn't even want hospital food in the first place! Who wants jello and soup on their lunch break! Yuck! Tacos sound good on the other hand....
---
You're a moron who isn't reading whats being said. This guy is claiming that the server is taking 15 secs to process what is happening, when it reality it isn't the server. He's playing on a dinosaur that can't handle the AoE graphic spam is more likely to be the case.
---
If by imbalance you mean the servers being horribly overcrowded then yes. The problem is that you can't walk five feet now without encountering another player anywhere in the level 50+ content.  way back then there were a lot fewer level 60s out and about, and I'm not talking 10% less. Back then you could actually quest in peace for a while before encountering PVP (which is why red=dead actually was something people not only said but actually did) but on classic, no one does that because there is an \*endless\* stream of players to fight and you would still be level 38 in STV if you actually attacked every single member of the other faction. 
---
I remember actually fighting almost every horde member I saw in STV, and I certainly don't remember grinding venture co goblins peacefully next to horde players.
---
P1
---
A consistent problem is that there are many of us who came with friend groups and the majority ruled. I got stuck like this. Sadly all of my irl friends quit because of various reasons. So now it's just me really and 2-3 other online friends. I could always reroll but that means leveling up, finding a new guild, gearing up all over again, becoming a core member, etc. I'd end up quitting entirely before having to do that.
---
Most other people that knew what they were getting into with a PvP realm probably did not expect things to be so toxic. I get that anything lvl 48+ gives honor and is "fair game". But I don't see a reason to farm these players. If you're lvl 60 you've got a huge advantage on them.
---
DId I miss something?  What is going on in relation to PVE servers?
---
Sorry bro you’re actually brain dead. People aren’t complaining because of the world PvP specifically. This isn’t even authentic to real vanilla wow. The high pop PvP servers have multiple times more players than the average high pop vanilla server. Faction imbalance and unplayable conditions because of shitty servers due to high amounts of players = why people are shitting on P2. 
---
I’m personally enjoying P2 but cmon man don’t be a filthy boomer
---
He's probably horde on a 70/30 horde-favored server.
---
And I'm saying that those problems can be solved as well, I'm not ignoring anything.. they're throwing their hands up and saying "Whelp can't be done!".
---
I expected all of them. That is why I rolled on pve as alliance. However now I feel like rerolling a rogue on alliance side on some pvp server so I can get some action as well.
---
Yea your not an OG. Just one of them. ReT a IL is O v e E R o N another sub.
---
Active and involved does not equate to server crashing. Again, on what planet is that a positive result? Sorry but your theory is awful.
---
so the majority of players
---
Well, if you consider that the most OP racial for horde RN is ganking alliance players 15 lvl below in group of 3 60 getting twice the HK, isn't that good isn't it
---
Em, ok? Yes, I suppose it is. Tomorrow is Monday too?
---
Same deal. Want tacos pay the price. Easy concept
---
&gt; Merely resurrecting would not cause you to show up on Spy.
---
"just don't play your character so the super NSA addon doesn't alert everyone to your presence! duh lmao, idiot"  
---
I can't believe people actually fucking use this defense
---
I'm so glad I looked at the censuses before picking a realm.  Mograine has a very healthy 50/50 split and the PvP has been very lively.
---
Do you really need to keep making these threads? lol
---
Exactly, goes along with the whole alliance vs horde theme of the entire game.
---
it's russian
---
Doubtful, I don't use trade since I'm a miner/eng for personal use only and anything i farm i put straight on the AH. I don't spam LFG either and I definitely never grouped with him for a dungeon/raid.
---
Seemed like a simple troll, saw me right outside grom gol, fished the same pool and rubbed it in followed up by a quick ignore, oh well.
---
This is the best in the sea of pvp threads lmao
---
At this point I've accepted the fact that I'll likely never get bene or truefaith.
---
i never said we should suck off military at all. but atleast have some decency about it i guess. i personally wouldnt make a whore joke about my own mother. i know thats apples to oranges but its an analogy i guess
---
A HK IS A HK NO MATTER HOW U EARN IT GGWP
---
Would you say the pop of your classic server has more than halved since august?
---
first of all its called rogue so write that down
---
second of all op complained about world pvp cuz sometimes its unbalanced like what did they expect??? fair fights? LOL at best its a server pop issue, has nothing to do with world pvp cuz even on 50/50 realms u will have zergs and bs ganking
---
Didn't expect this response but thanks for info. I always heard it was from Private Servers these issues came about but this explains it clearly how.
---
There’s nothing to accomplish. 
---
Classic has a lot going for it but cutting edge content is not one of those things.
---
Eh then I guess don't do it. If you can't see a way to make this profitable and easy then fine.. I can so I can see why someone would do it.
---
u mad?
---
What i am seeing on my server isnt world pvp tho, its literally hillsbrad only. Like Hillsbrad is a New BG.
---
It was fun cuz it was new and nobody knew what to do. Now we have 60s with full tier 1. Back then you were amazing if you were just 60
---
Because a vocal minority @ reddit don’t like the current state of pvp ?
---
A minor number of people will quit, maybe.
---
Judging from the 1 hour queue to my realm today, people are joining in, and in impressive numbers.
---
If you can't see the player with your human eyeballs you shouldn't get an addon that tells you they're nearby, fucking period. I don't get how this is possibly controversial.
---
fuck off with this shit again
---
It would only be moving goal posts if I was the one who said all, yet I did not. I very clearly stated most.
---
You can stop replying to me, somehow this simple convo is apparently above your capabilities.
---
People are saying DKs don't matter right now, is that true?
---
Going to be almost impossible with cross-server queues
---
An OG?... Lol step out of your mom's basement every once in a while kid.
---
I think most of the factors have been mentioned, but just to be sure:
---
\- Maces don't get weapon skill from Weapon Expertise, which is a huge loss
---
\- Mace Spec is mostly pointless in PvE and does no damage
---
\- Fist Weapons would be ok as a weapon type, but there are very few decently good fists in classic
---
\- On alliance side, many rogues are human so swords offers the best weapon skill (WE + human racial)
---
\- In PvP, where Mace Spec would be nice, deep combat isn't a commonly used build
---
So it really is a combination of factors that puts sword and dagger (combat) specs way ahead of other weapon types for PvE damage, while in PvP the burst potential of dagger builds is generally a huge draw.
---
To break Spy, you would need to break the ability of addons in general to be able to read from the combat log. This also means breaking things like Damage/Healing meters and even potentially threat meters. Threat meters take the ability and damage recorded and *estimates* what it thinks the threat would be, based on its own numbers. 
---
What at heart Spy does is merely read from the combat log and then display that information on a convenient UI. Which is exactly what many other addons do too.
---
If you want to break it then you would have to remove player presence from the combat log or limit the scan to an even shorter distance. That potentially breaks many other things if you do it that way, such as Deadly Boss Mods.
---
I kinda disagree that it's worse than a LFG system. LFG fundamentally changes the way the game is played and has birthed the Lich King era of people never leaving town to go do dungeons.
---
I mean - is Spy suddenly new to WoW Classic? Or has it in truth, really been around forever and people are protesting its existence 15 years later?
---
All of them. 
---
"Let alone guns"  okay COD stops being an FPS the moment you equip a rocket launcher. 
---
Overwatch is an FPS. By definition. You can have your gripes with it and that's completely fine but don't be ridiculous.
---
Hollly shit! You really HAVE invested your entire identity into this game, haven't you? Do you tell people at parties that you're a level 60 whateverwhatever? Do you talk about all your epic loots? Wait, do you even go to parties? Lmaooo!
---
&gt;If I wasn't at work with nothing else better to do I would've stopped this argument a long time ago....
---
hahah, yeah right!  You eat/breathe/live your entire life in this game, it's no wonder you're picking fights with people you don't know to defend your precious. 
---
Jesus... this is a whole other level of pathetic. I am actually starting to think this isn't funny... wow dude. Wow....
---
technically they did warn the fullx10 server people to take free transfers off,they didnt. this is a player made problem that is never going to go away until BGs come out if they dont jump start em. blizzard isnt going to constantly pump out servers because then u have a self fullfilling prochery as retail,15+ servers that will some day become dead.
---
He's literally summoning people. With three accounts, not ten.
---
What would require scripts?
---
You can always find premades to join too
---
imagine not being 60 within 3 months
---
Can’t wait for you to lose your ass and come here with more salty tears about how “horde sided” bgs are. 
---
Cry babies cry.
---
Wpvp is fine dude no one is complaining about that. We’re complaining that we can’t log on to are chars and turn in a quest, quest in general, grind mobs, or even get to some dungeons.... 
---
We would just love to play this awesome game but we can’t... and no... we’re not going to corpse run for the opposite faction for hours on end every night just cause it’s fair for your side. 
---
People who write shit posts like this are so selfish and can’t even imagine them selves In someone else’s shoes.
---
I think you're missing the point a bit here. One of the major benefits of this method is that you don't have to be on 40 hrs a week. You **can** just Raid log and have the benefit of getting gear **or** gold (sometimes both). 
---
Yes, in the first few runs, whoever has put in a ton of extra effort and nolifed for the most gold will get the gear (keep in mind that hunter grinding DM for gold is only bidding for hunter gear, he's not stopping other classes gearing). The gold they've farmed will then be distributed to the rest of the guild, helping out everyone that doesn't have the time or ability to farm (priests, tanks, etc).
---
Then the nolifers of your class will be geared and won't need it anymore so the price of that gear will lower, and you will have plenty of gold to buy it just from raid logging.
---
You might have better luck with the other systems, but from the amount of qq threads about the issues with DKP (hoarding for best pieces and D/E'ing upgrades and tier gear because everyone wants the one BIS) and Loot Council (corrupt funneling to GM &amp; mates) this alternative seems great to me.
---
Either way, hope you find a good guild and enjoy the looting process.
---
Yep. And if it’s Drink that I bought, I stay sitting for the full duration, or until my mana is full.
---
If we wipe, we wipe.
---
Amazing
---
'Profitable' is rather arbitrary. I could farm one silver in an hour and that would be 'profit'. The question is how profitable is it compared to other methods out there? If your gold method isn't making as much gold as simply doing DME solo farms then it isn't worth your time. In this case, summoning won't be as much gold as some of the more popular methods.
---
There's reasons to do it, for fun, perhaps, but if you're trying to maximise gold, this isn't it.
---
Yes, must be so boring to play on a Pve server
---
That's what I want to hear, cya on the battlefield mate
---
Finally, some real content for this sub.
---
ur just not trying
---
Considering more buffs will be getting added (ZG head, Zanza, DMF), what are you guys planning on doing to fit those buffs in
---
Faction imbalance was always a thing.  It just used to be the Alliance outnumbering the Horde and now it's the other way around
---
I agree with everything but the spy add ons maybe if they increased view distance.
---
All the PvP server players are realizing their rose tinted glasses for World PvP and the PvE players are just laughing
---
ShadowMeld OP.
---
Is it Pvp?
---
Is it happening in the world?
---
Scholo is one of the only instances I'd rather pug as the tank than pug dps because it is so, so noticeable when someone just doesn't know what they are doing. Forget all the more basic mechanics like threat-dropping and stunning bosses (Kirtonos/Krastinov/Rattle), ghouls that leave deadly gas clouds behind their bodies, phys-immune Dark Shades/Occultists, or the ghosts that insta-mana burn and silence. 
---
It's also little things like how to drag Rattle out of his room with only a few trash pulls, or the non-elite skeletons that are immune to non-holy magic and should be killed first or they'll go beating on your healer, or just how to path efficiently through some of the trickier rooms.
---
If I had to step out of my moms basement why I am arguing the horse shit ganking? You just called yourself out you 300 lb big boy. Go call ur mum for the tendies and huney mustie.
---
Are they though? Right now is just a group or raid of people zerging people down, I think numbers are dominating rather than class
---
For holy/prot Pally, should I have a separate set of gear for healing and tanking (cloth int gear for healing, mail gear for tanking)? Or can I get away with some int cloth/leather/mail gear mixed and do both roles?
---
It's BoE, trade it unless you are a ninja. But first of all talk about it in chat. If all agree to roll for cash just need roll. If someone presses greed just lett Them /roll against your need roll and trade them if they roll higher than the winner.
---
Blasted lands is practically empty over here. Like 5 people on either side, not even worth going there for honor.
---
fourms have plenty of peeople bitching...and its only been a few days since phase 2. if they dont jump start BGs your going to see a sudden spike of missing people within the next few weeks. because people will just outright quit until phase 3 and BGs come out.
---
they had to deal with 14 years worth of asshole gankers,they wont put up with it anymore then needed.
---
I play on both because of friends, and I felt like I was going to lose a lot of the play experience in pve which doesn't to seem to be the case. 
---
People willing to pvp are meeting up at locations and people who are not are going about thirty business. I miss pvp on my priest, but this has just made me feel more excited for AV... My favorite battleground
---
Black dragon whelp the crimson and emerald are just as difficult I heard. My friend gave me the emerald one I still have and treasure it.
---
For some odd reason I had this big RP thing about wearing and crafting my own dragon armor.
---
Holy shit... it really is 2006 all over again. It's like breaking open a 13 year old, stale packet of cheetos, and smelling that stale fake cheese aroma. What a pathetic community this game has cultivated. Imagine what it's like working at Blizzard, and having to deal with spergs like you all day... jesus, I would shoot myself.
---
That's a fair enough reason, but it's not the reason I am pointing out is silly. If people said "i could go PVE but don't want to have to level again" that's fair enough but people seem to be saying "I don't want PVE because I want to PVP when it's fair and when i feel like it" which is exactly what PVE is which is why that comment from so many seems silly to me.
---
The same way lol is not an mmo.
---
Honor should not be given for killing anything below 60 if you are 60. That’s my conclusion.
---
Yupp and these same people will look down on everyone on pve servers and try to act all elitist about the fact they rolled pvp. Jokes on them, nothing but a bunch of cry babies. Atleast we can enjoy the game!
---
Oh you mean people are getting tired of constant world PVP?
---
No that's actually the dead zone
---
Respec tank and dungeon up, start your own groups and slowly reserve 1 piece of your MS gear then you can swap back once you’re 60
---
When you join a conversation, at least try to follow the context please.
---
sounds like you haven't leveled a warrior.
---
That's a legit reason, I am not saying there's no legit reasons and people should all just re roll.
---
I'm just pointing out some of the comments people seem to say about what they want out of the game perfectly describe what a PVE server is but they seem to not realize this.
---
Do all quests which are near to each other. Dont fly around for one quest or run 30mins. Focus on locations of green quests. Here u kill the mobs a lot easier and u have less downtime for drinking. Collect quests for dungeons and do them in one or two runs.
---
Give yourself some time to understand the game and all its parts. It's complex and u can do a lot of stuff. Get 60 asap - thats when the real game starts.
---
Have fun 😊👍
---
No, I mean imbalance like in Herod where estimates about populations in every site that claims to do so puts it at between 60-70 percent of total population as horde players in Herod, the server I play.
---
What I mean is not the leveling experience, that is another hell entirely. I really mean 60's WPvP. It's bad because every FP or instance portal is camped and ganked.
---
There was not a single time this weekeng, I swear to god, that IF didn't have rogues inside Military Ward or Mystic Ward ganking and constant little raids at the gates. Sometimes big raids. Is the same happening the other way around? Hell, no, because there is not enough Alliance players to do so.
---
Like many things in classic, the joy of the content comes from how organic it is, and how it requires people to work together to accomplish things.
---
That said from a gameplay/expression of skill standpoint, it’s complete garbage.
---
What’s so hard to understand about this, guy?   They want to play on a PvP server, but they want to be able to move about and PvE at their leisure and only PvP when it is convenient for them.   It’s pretty simple really.  Blizzard caused this mess by not allowing these players some type of ((flag)) or setting so that they can enable/disable the ability for others to engage in PvP with them in the open world.  Allowing people to just freely attack them when they don’t want to be attack is paramount to assault and an attack on the constitutional freedoms afforded to them by their home country.   You people are just saying open world PvP should be able to happen without consent and IT IS DISGUSTING.    
---
And NO, this is not the perfect description of a PvE server because everyone knows world PvP doesn’t happen on PvE servers.  Also these players probably have 10s of hours invested in their 30-40 level characters so asking them to reroll? OUT OF THE QUESTION.   They even reserved some shitty name that they may not can get any where else.  Blizzard needs to recognize that these people have LIVES outside of the game, they’ve got 5 kids to feed man! Blizzard needs to dedicate 100s or 1000s of man hours to completely rewrite how PvP servers operate to better fit these poor players idea of how they think these types of servers operate.  
---
Also, epics are too hard to achieve.  AINT nobody got time for that.  They should be normal quest rewards to that the little guy has opport.... fuck it I can’t do it anymore with a straight face.
