these posts are all the same. you understood what you signed up for with a PvP server but didnt expect it to be so unbalanced. 
---

---
even on a 50/50 server theres more horde pvping. Thats the nature of the factions in this game. horde typically pvps more and alliance typically pves more. 
---
Either reroll pve or have fun as the underdog. Take pride in the hks you do make
---
---
---
Ally or horde? I'm on Fairbanks horde side
---
Still hoping for that boomkin to ask for an invite myself. ”Underdog” classes always has prio in my eyes  :3
---
You mean too many Horde. 
---
Regardless, games almost unplayable as alliance right now on servers like Herod.  People are gonna start quitting if their reward for waiting 2 hours in queue is being camped indefinitely.  You can act like this is just one piece of the puzzle all you want but when the game isn't enjoyable as an entire faction due to being overwhelmed every second you're not in an instance, the other issues are a mute point.
---
&gt;but I sort of accept it
---
You literally just made a post for your server calling on Horde to gank a Boomkin that was ganking you.
---
Just a little salty. My DBM has recorded 90 Rend kills. I have seen both the main hand and offhand no less than 6 times each. Twice I have lost the roll to hunters, once to an Orc Warrior (get axes ya scrubs) and the other times to other rogues. One time I was doing resets to find Jed for our healer, and got locked out. The group runs and the OH drops. But of all the times I have run it, we only failed due to hunter pets.  
---
  
---
Obviously I can't blame them for having the worst luck in Azeroth, but the failures were entirely preventable, and yeah it does really make me question whether I want to take a Hunter for my instance farms.  
---
Again, I don't mean it personally, I'm just a man at my wit's end.
---
Shamans were literally written to be the Paladin counter. It was the last class Tom Chilton wrote, nearer to the launch of the game.

Does not look remotely 50-50
---
I did it with holy novq the other night. We had a pally to off heal and I had to drink a ton, but it did the trick.
---
Totally agree. They didn't cause or even influence anything to do with faction balance. It's up to the community and rng to decide that, which is what happened.
---
Ppl have a hard time with him?
---
You just need to whisper me, as a mage I love taking hunters because it's less gear competition
---
THANK YOU! I was searching for this, knowing my 1.12 version doesn't work.
---
If it's something like strat undead a mage is far and away the best at taking he adds off the healer at baron
---
Lord of the Rings lore stuff, it's a sad story of a mortal man who falls in love with an immortal elf. Worth a read!
---
Shift-click on item will create such "link" in chat.  
---
Later you could even link whole professions, like "Enchanting book". So you could scroll through it and select enchant that you want.
---
So paladins do die *occasionally*
---
Guys don't you GET IT?! You just have to stop playing the game how you want and play it in this very specific way and it's FINE!
---
And that doesn’t take too long to generate CPs?
---
I ran through sw trade with a group of 10, no one even batted an eye
---
I remember i had a /played 42 days when i hit 60. I took my more then one year of reaching 60. However i was 12 when i started and no clue at all what the game was about i just loved playing it. Running around in cties visit armor shop that sell only white items chill in booty bay you name it ive done it all begore i even reached 60 i figured out what addons were when i was level 55. Proper hardcore i would say for a non native speaking child at the age of 12 trying to figure out where the quest objectives were. Also i hears of thottbot when i was around 50. Dont even know how i managed to get 60 at all back then
---
Its a display bug they said they'd fix after next reset so tomorrow.
---
I'm on Heartseeker 80%+ alliance. The most unbalanced server there is, and it's a complete blast!
---
I agree the complaining is a bit much, but it’s not that people “don’t want to be on a pve server” it’s that they didn’t see pvp servers be 10-40 man groups patrolling every 48+ zone, flight path, and dungeon entrance.
---
I personally would transfer my toon to a pve server if I had the option, but I’m not about to re level to 60 and re acquire all my pre BIS and raid gear I’ve acquired. My view of a pvp server was having been in one since tbc, but never having played classic, I never expected this.
---
I expected it to be closer to how it was in phase 1. Organic pvp with some players playing passively and others aggressively, adding an element of danger with the excitement of trying to fight back when you do get jumped. Instead it’s “oh shit there’s someone of the opposite faction, and there’s the rest of their raid coming to kill you until you’re no longer worth honor.”
---
Complaining won’t do anything though, either reroll or wait it out, but I don’t blame people for not wanting to re roll. I’ll be logging in for raids and that’s it until bgs are out and there’s a bit of relief.
---
Uhhh so coming back to full hp and mana after being dead from crossing the continent isn’t your definition of “abuse” as you just explained? They’re not being killed by the guards at the zeppelin as they should be, just like the horde “abusing” this teleporter.  Definitely comparable, but logic is hard, so I forgive you.
---
Nah, I've played with friends, solo lots of the times tho, just like a lot of other players.  
---
On the underdog alliance server I'm on, grouping up it just means there's more fighting before the horde flock to you and stop you from questing, or bring in a ?? To settle the score. 
---
Idk why so many people are obsessed with saying it's my fault... There are so many people still leveling. Why is it considered acceptable for the server health to unanimously ruin the experience of lowbie alliance players? There is already a shortage of allies, it just doesn't make sense. If I were horde id go easy on the levelers for the same reason you don't slaughter all your animals in the fall.
---
You think you wanted to be on a PvP server, but you don't
---
About two months ago my tendinitis started worsening quite rapidly as a result of poor keybind layout (and playing too much WoW) So I threw out all my keybinds and started over. Sat down, rated most of what I believe are the important keys on the keyboard on a 1-5 scale, as you can see [here](https://i.imgur.com/baMcgoK.png) and then I counted all the spells, items and misc. keybinds I'd need (pet controls for instance). Concluded that a baseline of 24 unique keybinds would be enough to support up to 96 keybinds, which exceeds my need for unique keybinds by around 15 or so.
---
Here is a screenshot of my UI with 2nd action bar showing (it's normally hidden) and [here's](https://i.imgur.com/mjFb9t9.png) one with the secondary action bar hidden. This is how my UI normally looks.
---
Each button on my action bars is a normal modifier macro. Here is the template that I used:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [nomod]
---
    /cast [mod:shift]
---
    /cast [mod:ctrl]
---
    /cast [mod:alt]
---
I do use a cooldown tracker called TellMeWhen to keep track of important stuff like death coil, potion CDs etc to compensate for the fact that I can't see CDs on my bars.
---
Total number does matter. When the game was originally made for server sizes around 2.5 - 3k max, and nothing has been changed in terms of respawns, nodes, etc. etc. and the server sizes are triple the size, it makes a massive difference.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Let's just say a server averages 7k people on throughout the day. Now all of them are not 60, all of them are not doing the same activity. So let's just say a little over half is 55+ and taking part in World PvP. Now it takes like 10-20 people just to kill everybody in town and hold your ground for a little while until guards and players overwhelm you. For Horde and Alliance, there's 19 towns and FPs they can go camp that aren't major cities. Between the neutral cities, there are 6 total. So 25 towns and FPs each faction can go to and camp around.
---
So 10-20 people x 25 is 250 - 500 people. Now if we were to take that 250 - 500 people on a Vanilla server of maybe a population of like 1500 online at any given time and let's say there's about 700 - 800 doing end game content, that's more than half just in cities and such. That will leave other Horde open to ganks and such and then people will need to leave those areas to go help out, and if you want to make big raids, you need to give up cities.
---
Now same math applies, but to current servers with, let's just say, 3000 people doing end game content. That is 2500 - 2750 people left to roam around and do whatever they want for PvP. The total number does matter, because you can have those people just camp towns and cities all day long, and still have a large force of people running around doing group raids in open areas, major cities, etc.
---
Obviously all of my above examples are estimations that may have some give or take to them. While it all sounds fun and enjoyable to see that massive open world battle all over the place, it's not as enjoyable when you know every place you step, no matter what level or what you're doing, you're dead. Back then, the open world PvP was much better because people were not able to just have forces in every single area just demolishing anything that looks red. With servers this size, I think they should make killing a player who's a grey level or a certain level range that scales up as you level, a dishonorable kill if you initiate the combat. However, if a grey level player initiates combat with you, you get to kill them for nothing. Think this would solve the problem too of higher level players just killing everyone and everything in sight. Not sure if something like this is even doable, but it sounds like it can be done.
---
well, hillsbrad is literally just a spam for hks. It's not fun, nor is it optimal honor unless you afk/bot or whatever
---
Could maybe take a look here:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community?webhook](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community?webhook)
---
depends, are you horde?
---
Probably that dude that was posting here all the time talking about buying gold/accounts and how to play and all that
---
if you’re orc, go with axes if you can. Until you get more hit and crit gear, stick with your 2H
---
You realize honor has not even been out a week yet?
---
*Refresh page*
---
37 you are mostly OK but once you hit 48 you may want to dungeon spam or take a break until BGs
---
Just updated the post. I’m bigglesworth alliance
---
Well also cheap shot and gouge, it's best to reset the fight as much as possible
---
yeah man 5-7 hours a day is an unhealthy amount of time imo. What game can you play for that long each day and not get bored? Probably doesn’t exist
---
Spy has little to do with the current clusterfuck. 
---
And I bet my left nut Spy isn't going anywhere. Classic LFG didn't.
---
It’s a pvp server. Just have to know where to grind and where not to. Plus at this point most people have leveled and moved on from the zones you’d be in. If you don’t like being yanked try a normal server.
---
I only have one ah alt the rest are storage in BB the bank and mailbox are all they need
---
You I hate this Addon as a rogue... can’t even sneak past people without getting aoe’d
---
&gt; I mostly hate those because they reduce the gap between good and bad players.
---
No, it doesn't. The player still has to act accordingly on the information.
---
Ele is so strong in PvP premades may bring a single one to rank in BGs. Amazing really.
---
Cool broken class doing mass aoe
---
All ranks of pally heals have the same cast time between ranks - it doesn't change unlike other healers.  EG: Flash is always 1.5 sec and holy light is always 2.5 sec.
---
The reason why downranking is especially good for paladins is a combo of blessing of light and illumination.  Downranked spells heal for a lot more than they otherwise would on a target that has blessing of light because it adds a huge amount to to effective +heal of the spell on that target.
---
This is the right answer here.
---
Spy
---
You're comparing something both sides can do to something only one faction can do.
---
Also: like I said, it changes it's position randomly, I hearthed back to IF and it's [**at it's place**](https://imgur.com/YAucACP) again but will fuck itself up again like it does constantly
---
People *think* that a bad level 60 is better than a good level 58.  They forget that the 60s that they're trying to get for Strat/Scholo aren't geared. Even if they are, ungeared vs. geared in classic isn't like ilvl 300 vs. 450 in retail. The power curve is really low.
---
Tetris. All day, erry day.
---
!addons
---
What if i told you PVP happens on PVE servers as well? What if I told you there's constant raid groups battling in Hillsbrad on the PVE servers as well?
---
Lmao
---
ah i see
---
Nope.  You don't get weapon procs or damage.  You get stats, chance to hit, chance to crit and armor from weapons though.
---
I do always love how people try and rationalise their bullshit.
---
Meanwhile my raid has two Quel's, is full of well geared people because when you play with non selfish dicks *everybody* gets geared and people don't drop your guild every 10 seconds, and we stomp all the content in game.
---
Such a terrible outcome, I best change asap.
---
Just hope bgs are out by the time you’re 48. Right now you might get ignored by the roaming raid groups, but once you award honor you’re absolutely screwed if it’s anything like it is now.
---
If I wasn’t a rogue I’d have stopped playing by now because I can’t imagine how awful it is when 20 people are running all around the area where they killed you trying to get you the full 5 times they reward honor before moving on, by which point you will have waited like 15-20 minutes just reading.
---
Google "sunk cost falicy" for me.

As a mage u should be fine, first of all if ur decent at pvp u have enough spells at 37 to beat the average 60 warrior who doesnt use consumes. Second, u aoe farm extremely well and lvls will come quick, and once u hit 44ish u can start doing zf coc farming with no threat of ganks
---
and how's the experience? i have yet to play classic, and i've been told multiple times that "the true experience is a pvp server" but since phase 2 started everyone is complaining more than before about faction inbalance, corpse camping, etc., in general i really want to do pvp but still not sure if i'm going to miss too much if i do roll on a pve server
---
What? This isn’t even hard. Put a 2% penalty on xp, honor and rep for each point your faction is over 55% of total server pop.
---
People will “self deport” from the over populated faction fixing the balance, not the under populated faction, making the imbalance worse.
---
Just because you can’t think of solutions doesn’t mean others, especially well paid game designers, can’t.
---
Half of game design is just getting players to do what you want them to do through sticks and carrots.
---
I keep lesser valued items on the 2nd alt and check it less often
---
you are 37? you are able to do the ganking, go to any horde zone like hilsbrad/stonetalon/ashenvale etc and gank the shit out of horde!
---
You've obviously never come up against a premade with some good geared paladin healers.  Good luck.  Shamans are nice in pvp, but paladins are *broken* healers in classic - especially once the phases roll on and the potential pvp healing gear starts going through the roof.
---
You’re right but people are still going to get killed many times regardless which is what people don’t realize about all the “the servers are too full” comments. Same on pservers, when people are ranking you’re going to get killed so you may as well nut up and try to get yourself a couple HKs in return.
---
BigBrainTanking
---
PvP servers right now are gankers ganking gankers ganking gankers. if you're trying to do 5-man openworld content in p2 - better bring a full raid to protect you from gankers.
---
I concur, it is a no effort, zero skill crutch that provides huge wpvp advantages.
---
Better pvp racials
---
stoneform is literally the best pvp racial in the game.

Well I’ve always played on high pop servers and really can’t see any difference In the population, sure if you choose to quest in a zone that has a world boss or raid entrance you’re gonna see a lot of people. Also although they didn’t use layers back in vanilla, new servers opened up almost daily due to the demand and eventually they allowed free character moves from the high pop servers. People saying that you didn’t get ganked back in vanilla quite clearly didn’t play back then.
---
Pretty sure that's bannable.

When everyone in my group of friends was like 13 at vanilla launch and deciding on classes, blink wasn't even on my radar in terms of reasons to choose mage. Friends went warrior, rogue, priest, shaman, hunter, and mage (myself), and it wasn't until a few levels after getting blink that I realized what a boon of an ability it was. 
---
Went lock this time around for a change of pace while still being a caster. Just got my alt mage to 20 and I've been blinking on cool-down like a madman! It's so fun! Splitting the gap between terrain is just the best inconsequential feeling. Oh and it removes stun? Lmao ok.
---
Anyways. Blink rocks.
---
The classes not feeling as fun hits man. I was having a blast levelling my characters before the BFA pre-patch then after the fun level dropped tremendously. I loved looking into what artifact traits my characters would get and how it impacted each spec. Picking the same azerite traits over and over has a fraction of that excitement.
---
I'm farming that damned savage glad chest, and I shall have it. I personally don't mind mostly corpse running my way in there for a bis item that much, but if someone was lower level than I am, or a fresh 60 trying to gear up, I pity them. For they must, as you said it, "get into the hottest zone of Azeroth".
---
Bigglesworth isnt the worst server, and you're a mage so lots of options for dungeons though getting to them will be tough.
---
my post was a joke, i dont think people know who dossou even is
---
&gt; especially once the phases roll on and the potential pvp healing gear starts going through the roof.
---
Way to contract yourself lol. In later phases melee is useless and it's all about caster meta, in which shaman outshines paladins by a longshot.
---
And there is Asmon(never played Vanilla) crying for early BGs because he wants to be a streamer and play on a PVP server. Fuck him and every other entitled streamer.
---
The population of pve realms is very small compared to pvp realms
---
I like it because I always get to experience the world. Also, getting summoned by another brolock is pretty great
---
yeah camping flight paths must be boring af
---
Because they want axe/bow skill + troll haste + Windfury.
---
Alright Mr. 3 minute Fear Ward.
---
Not that sad, actually. He became the hero of legends and she gave up on immortality to stay with him.
---
Your cluelessness is cute. End game a shaman will global kill a full t3 paladin.
---
Ya... Hybrids willing to do the roles they can tend to be better players.
---
Literally every DPS only warrior I've played with has been awful leveling. 
---
I am also a DPS warrior, tanking your dungeon, you could at least do similar dps.... Even worse when they are higher level and specced Fury so I cant even battle shout. 
---
I've tried to avoid them, but some dungeons it's basically impossible.
---
They have pve servers for people like you.
---
Out of curiosity ... I thought all the census stuff was broken, how are people so sure about their realm balance these days?
---
AV is severely alliance sided IIRC
---
People assumed there would be a more or less even(ish) split on the servers and tryhards won't just rush to easy-mode faction in droves...
---
Alas, people were wrong
---
I was the opposite. I played Horde since vanilla to BFA, decided to level an Alliance alt. I was shocked to find out how terrible questing flowed from one level to another. Once I hit STV I really realized how terribly located Alliance camps are. 
---
Horde leveling experience was kind of smooth. Barrens -&gt; Stonetalon -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; 1K needles 
---
Alliance is basically go to the opposite side of the continent or to the other continent every level. Of course the questing hub has no flight path or it’s on the edge of the map
---
Ony attunement is way easier tho
---
wat
---
I think I know what kind of job you’re referring to.
---
I have dash/growl/claw/bite. 
---
When I'm in raids/instances I use auto claw and bite. When do you use prowl?
---
This seems very reasonable.
---
No it just fires one
---
You sound scared.
---
Horde.
---
And thats your right. But all these comaints pushing for phase 2 to end effect everyone. The people who are enjoying and rolled pvp for this open world shit show. But our opinion isnt important to you, you just want to play the game your way on a pvp server and if it doesnt work you quit. So quit.
---
Calm down bud
---
Is enhancement Shaman really that bad? I want to play one as my alt for fun but I'm worried I won't be able to get gear.
---
Faction imbalance too, but yes pop and therefore player density is the major structural factor.
---
So, before Wotlk came out, i had suggested on the forums to do class dungeons. Instead of the 5 man tank/healer/3dps, 5hunters, 5 priests etc. I mean how cool would it be to have 5 hunters who have to kite 5 mobs onto 5 buttons at the same time to solve a puzzle. Or a boss that requires every to eyes of the beast because the hunters wont fit into the area. Just a bunch of different challenges that require 5 man coordinated mastery of that classes skill set. The rhok quests showed off what was the best of wow and i wish they had grown on that instead of the direction WOTLK had started to take....
---
They get honor when ppl fight back or when they rez 
---
They know this
---
Even if you can reach the hit cap by items, it's usually better to take the % hit as it allows you to go for more offensive pieces in your build.
---
Read the very top most line on the screenshot
---
I don’t use the add on. I’m just explaining how it does what it does. People can be salty all they want but it is 100% data that you can pull yourself in game. To do it as well as the add on makes it? Probably not. Like I said I don’t use it or watch the logs like that, just saying it works using the games info
---
Typically you just use parts of the set you don't have to use the entire one.
---
Lol address the issue but dont change anything
---
Great non answer.
---
You want them to change the game. Just say it. Jesus.
---
Menethil harbor.
---
All of those people that played Alliance want to experience the other part that they missed in vanilla.
---
Non-60s make it difficult to skip unnecessary packs. If I’m 60 I don’t care about xp, I care about loot.
---
&gt;for pushing the overzealous #NoChanges nonsense
---
Because cramming 15k-20k players in a world built for 3k is totally #NoChanges, yeah.
---
If your casually playing wow and getting killed by people who are playing seriously, its the natural order of things. You're inflating your ego to think that because you're getting camped and not having fun its "ruining server health".
---
So? Classic will die; so what; no kings rule forever; you expect classic without new stuff to last 5+ years?
---
Spy just compounds it, instead of being able to possibly run by somewhere with no one seeing you, you get zerg’d by 10 people instantly when they know where you are.
---
Roll and alt on a pve server and make some new homies. 
---
Personally my alts have been having a cruisy time. A bit of pvp. Just finished hillsbrad and i honestly got killed by a 60 maybe 4 times. 
---
Most othertimes it was lowbie goon squads or 1v2 2v1 2v3 duels.
---
Got some honour too so i might hit rank 3 for the extra discount on my 40 mount in a few weeks.
---
dang, that would have been huge.
---
so did the alliance the countless times transfers opened. 
---
there are plenty of issues with just up and leaving a server as well. 
---
not to mention, transferring horde isn't even a real solution. there are still far more horde on pvp servers than alliance players, unless you expect people to transfer onto pve servers to appease the minority alliance.
---
I’ve accepted that I’m inevitably going to spec into this, but I’ve just been having too much fun with feral tanking and LOTP so I’ve been putting it off for as long as possible. I’m probably respeccing next week though for the reset. My heart tells me to stay feral and farm preraid BIS tanking gear, but my brain tells me I’m silly for not healing in raids and being able to roll on T1 Druid shit, especially since there’s like 1-3 druids a raid. Seriously gimped myself by going into MC as a DPS cat with bear talents. Fml. I am under no illusions though. I know they only brought me along as a decurse bot/mana battery. I am not geared enough to heal or tank here, but hey, 3 druids a raid max. I like my rolling odds.
---
10man grps is great honor? What?
---
Oh I wasn't assuming you used it. I was just saying that for people who do use it should not be able to use it, and should be forced to manually monitor this stuff if they really want to know who's nearby and such. I get that if the game pulls the info, it can be made into an addon. However, I don't like the idea of having this specifically for PvP just generating it all for you neatly. PvP should be about being careful about where you're going and who you fight, not having an addon tell you if you should or should not be going a certain direction because of who's around.
---
- Mage check

- Horde check

- Gearcapped check
---
When you're the dominant faction it's all gravy, when you're not you get obliterated, and outzerged. (Sadly)
---
Yes world pvp is amazing, just sucks when you're outnumbered 4:1 due to faction imbalance.
---
I mean, why would you bring two? They're a support class afterall, even if ele can deal decent damage.
---
How does +healing work on regrowth for druids?
---
Eh, you are citing sound logic, it just isn't adding up to what I am experiencing in game. That with the original statement that the servers are much larger than vanilla, with no other announcement from Blizzard that these servers have "reduced" back to original vanilla size still leaves me to believe that we are under higher populations.
---
Probably has templates for all sorts of issues and fills them out on some other program then copy pastas them into the tickets.... looks like he/she was trying to multitask a bit too much. Rip
---
Loot competition.
---
I mean, hes a mage, so the guy in IF has like a 10 sec head start
---
Goon squads are the most fun. Tbh. Big pvp is nice though expecially on my server.
---
It was a joke.
---
&gt;sometimes you have a fair 1 on 1 fight
---
literally doesn't happen on Bloodfang-EU. Horde only moves in packs of 3+ and if you try to fight them, then a full raid arrives in 5 mins 90% of the time.
---
I agree that Zandalar Tribe has a really healthy population, not high enough to cause queue’s but high enough to find whatever you need in game. 
---
This is just a bad time/phase/transitional state for pre-60’s. 
---
Take a breath, chill.. pvp servers always be challenging for leveling, but after so many years getting the original honor system and wpvp, and having high population willing to wpvp, i admit it may be right now more like hell than challenging. This will most likely cool down, the launch of honor system is still fresh.
---
And again there is nothing wrong with Zandalar Tribe, from what i read the ratio is more like 55/45 in favor of alliance, my experience as an alliance there are times that i feel heavily outnumbered by the horde and there are times me and my team roam and cause pain for the horde. I guess the feeling is mutual for horde too. Both factions have gank squads roaming 40+ maps, contested zones are really contested, and i think this is how it is supposed to be in a pvp server.
---
Crusader mats are only 60-70g orbs are 28g x2 and shards are 3gx4.. Not expensive at all
---
Fuck me you have 1/8th of my buttons
---
Let's not pretend that at least a part of the playerbase didn't want Nostalrius style megaservers. What's more, they would call all servers smaller than Herod dead or about to be in X time and absolutely refuse to switch to a less populated server despite waiting in a absolutely, unimaginably crazy queue because "I don't wanna play on a dead realm".
---
16 is slow but who cares?
---
My rogue in original vanilla took 11 days as a noob to MMO's.
---
Average for a noob should be about 10-12 days to 60 depending on class and if they spend time afking/dicking around. 
---
You won't fall behind, people will still run ony/mc right through classic and you will have less competition for gear when you hit 60.
---
HE LITERALLY SAID THAT HE WOULD HAPPILY ACCEPT A PAID TRANSFER TO A PVE REALM YOU FUCKING MOUTH BREATHING PIECE OF HUMAN WASTE I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
---
I have a 60 warrior on Smolderweb - alliance. 
---
 I've always played on a pvp server for the past 15 years and I was hyped for phase 2 as I never really experienced the game without BG's (was 12yo back then and didn't take the game that seriously)
---
Farmed enough for my epic mount and tons of consumables for pvp as I knew it was going to be rough for a warrior in this warzone.
---
But I never expected it to be this bad! Being a melee in these large scale battles is the worst pvp experience I've had in this game since I started playing. And not being able to roam around without a death squad coming after you is not was I was hopping for.
---
So I rolled an alt on a PVE server until BG's come out and I'm back to enjoying the game! Like a lot of people I like the constant riak a PVP server brings but this is just not enjoyable at all for me
---
&gt; This is not a +15 mythic key in retail. Dungeons are one button spams for most classes. This shit is not complicated.
---
Which is exactly why they dont want to invite 58s. You can't really make up damage through skill, it's just a gear check.
---
The best clutches are when Druid pops out of cat form and battle rezzes the healer because the group accidentally pulled too many mobs. 
---
Feels so nice and always get comments about a wipe save
---
NO CHANGES
---
What. Are you fucking kidding me.
---
I find that well geared physical carries leave me little room but to JoR + SoR. They tend to be very focused on a primary target. I prefer to group with mages and multidotters, as it much better emphasis the strength of the aoe aggro generation that pPally has so abundantly. Best feeling is when you're with 3 mages, as you can just pull giant packs, bubble and/or LoS to group them up and nuke them down. But on level 60 it's been very useful to keep a druid or warrior instead of the third mage, because they can add much needed active mitigation to big packs with Demo Roar/Shout and Thunderclap.
---
Ok, I was close. Been a long time I've been on a pve server.
---
bombs? most used ones are sapper charges and iron grenades soo
---
Thanks for not lying
---
You thought you did, but you really didn't.
---
Der-ps warriors in classic make hunters in vanilla look good.
---
Been 2 man pvping with my friend (I'm warlock, he is warrior) and Mages seem to be the best class by far. I'm a noob myself but they seem crazy OP compared to most, with their available kit. Add in the being undead, and you got yourself a completely broken class.
---
Oh yea sure. A lot of the things happening right now have definitely happened back in vanilla. People were still camping FP masters, raid entrances, camping corpses, etc. But it was never unplayable like it is now. The difference in play for both my alt and main is very much distinguishable when compared to my vanilla days. 
---
I guess it was just the opening weekend and maybe it'll die down a bit in a couple of weeks. 
---
But yea, we've never had to wait in 2 hour queues even with like 10+ layers back in original wow.
---
No idea about the resilience change effect on hit.
---
Yeah right. Dying almost 20 times before reaching BRM is F U N
---
Or maybe since you see more anti-horde posts we can reach the conclusion that alliance are little bitch babies who cry cry cry? :'(
---
I wish, all the good ret paladin gear is just warrior and rogue gear
---
Pairs with Shadowmeld.    
---
So will be for when I need to quickly afk, or when I want to sit and ambush someone.
---
Imagine being jealous of someone getting sixty before you.
---
To help with the dungeon grind you can play an alt for a few days and bank up rested xp before hitting dungeons. It makes it more worth the ~30 minutes it takes to get into an instance even if you only get one run.
---
4 unicorns, we have 1 in our guild, plus another 5 holy pallys, our last raid we had more pallys than mages or warriors
---
They could be looking for a mage for reasons other than straight DPS. They might need the waters, or more importantly the decurse.
---
So blizzard has to change what? Change racial abilities to make alliance better? Force people to not play if they are on the dominant server?
---
Impact other players enjoyment of the game so you can enjoy the game. You arent solving issues you are passing them to someone else to deal with.
---
Its pathetic.
---
Someone told me to go with what I liked, which was daggers, although now im seeing just how abysmal it seems damage wise and am definitely going to try dual swords. I just hit level 14, any cheap swords on the AH i can buy 2 of that you would recommend?
---
Priest on Thunderfury :) which I’m pretty sure is fairly even.
---
Was the 'unpopular opinion' opening really necessary?
---
Powerleveling services count FYI
---
I cant wait to ding my pally to 60 and get pvp healing. Hes almost there.
---
Thunderfury is very live :) but keep the tears coming 😩
---
Freezing band proc turns enemy into block of ice, stunning them in process. Root is when enemy is just immobilized. Equiping that on paladin is questionable but its his money.
---
how did you contact blizzard? i find calling them rather than using a the ticket system works best.
---
This fix didn’t change their behaviour. You can still break groups up as long as they aren’t a forced multi mob encounter (like a boss with minions) but are just pulled together based on proximity.
---
I love being a mushroom in a world of Rock Paper Scissors.
---
&gt; If it was doing something that wasn't feasible in game then I would be on board with everyone's complaints.
---
That argument doesn't make sense....  That does not justify it in any way.
---
Whatever justifies your opinion
---
Different mindset. I guess also alot of retail players have been slowly switching to horde as they have had the better raiding and pvp scene for a long time. So they have slowly gotten used to playing a certain faction. 
---
Although with private servers alot of it was alliance skewed.
---
Respec to combat. You should be able to handle up to 3 mobs as Rogue.
---
&gt;free action potion
---
Except they just sheep you until FAP wears out.
---
I didn't care so much that the message was in the log, but in vanilla other add ons did similar. Like you say i just stealthed far away, if they got a notification they'd blow cool downs and the like and i;'d just wait that out then get them when they were done.
---
I shamed them, they were ashamed.
---
Booooooooooooooo, you have an invalid opinion because you are a geared 60 horde.
---
Look at you all butthurt. 
---
Tell me how making this thread helped you?
---
And then there's me who helps people with a brd quest run when on bored and they can't find a healer besides having benediction and raid gear. Not all people are like that :)
---
I wish there were more Shadow Priests. One of my friends plays a resto Druid, so I almost never have anyone in my party who can remove magic or diseases. That 30 min 20% movement speed slow from ghouls in Strat is just nasty...
---
I feel that, good luck out there. It sucks that you are getting murdered for 0 honor too. Now is a good time for second professions tho. Got my fishing to 145
---
Last post was about pleading a ban for buying gold.
---
I think pointing out the posts about horde mostly just proves that alliance players are too busy crying on Reddit instead of playing the game. Although it was already mostly known that alliance consists of little baby boys who just wanna play paladins and love each other. It's okay guys just stay in stormwind where everybody just GETS ALONG!
---
Everybody is doing farm runs in there. Lasher runs, tribute runs, jump runs, tome runs, whatever. I legit see nobody ever looking for normal DM groups on my server.
---
You’re the type of person who makes the games SO MUCH more enjoyable.
---
There is no problem.
---
The only problem is whiny kids on reddit.
---
No reason 58 and 59s cant run the dungeons. This is classic its about having fun. My least favorite experiences are with the l337 min maxers. Just play the game how it was intended and have fun. I feel like a lot of people have already lost the spirit of classic. Invite some lower levels and have fun.
---
Hi, /u/NewEngClamChowdr

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dycf9x/someone_just_whispered_me_and_their_chat_colour/). 
---
You just *say* that most people agree with you, you don’t know that at all. I know for a fact that plenty of people want spellbatching in the game, albeit they want it toned down. The reason why no changes is a thing is because no one can agree on changes to make, that includes the changes you suggested.
---
This is true. I've been thinking a ton about this and the only thing I can think of is to make every server PvE until the realm pops drop to actual vanilla levels. It would basically be a war mode type fix.
---
Don't get me wrong. I rolled a Prot Warrior on a PvP server KNOWING I was going to get mauled to death most of the time, but the issue on Sulfuras is that the Horde camps the boats, the flight paths, the raid portals, the neutral vendors, hell they've even came into Redridge on a raid night to camp that flight path as they know Alliance tend to spawn there.
---
It's a little over the top. And now with how much time is invested, I would rather stop playing than reroll.
---
Zandalar Tribe represent
---
That and not everyone had an addon installed which told you if an enemy was nearby. All this together has made a recipe for disaster.
---
On Grobbulus there is literally nowhere to grind.  Too many people and everyone has Spy so even if they don't see you as long as they get close enough to have you pop up they will go looking.
---
Yeah, I'm a Mage. I just always loved the questline and sword in vanilla. By "raid gear is ick" I mean taking the offhand purely for raiding isn't worth it for me.
---
I've seen 5-6 posts so far this morning all blaming blizzard.
---
Also, why would you name a server that has the same volume as a high population thriving vanilla server as “low”?
---
Nobody wants to play on a “ Low” server, even if it is technically the same as a high vanilla. People wanted longevity in servers so they picked the high pop. They should have named those “Packed and uncomfortable “
---
How about this really crazy idea: groups or raids don't have a range limit for combat log.
---
this is a meta adaptation because people realised that small gank squads are the best way to farm honor quickly and efficiently and not get stuck in these big battles.
---
hah so accurate
---
Hang on just let me check all of my alliance level 60s on all the servers and tell you which server has the "best economy"
---
Oh fuck I didn't realize you had to fight Horde while riding through Horde territory. Geez I can't believe that would even happen, what bad game design.
---
Shaman , because of chain lightning and winfury. It makes me feel like a fantasy world version of a jedi and everyone loves winfury totems. Self healing is nice. I always feel like I have something I can do . Close , far or mid range. Which makes it feel less stale.
---
Soul link warlock can reliably beat spriest.
---
&gt;clear'd
---
Sounds about right.
---
We won't need to queue though, they can gank all they want. We will be farming honour time and time again whilst they get a few games in to our dozens.
---
It hasn't cause 90% of reddit base is even 60 yet.
---
That's what I did! Definitely going to return to the PvP server eventually, but right now I really just wanna grind XP while listening to a podcast or audiobook.
---
Note: my pvp server toons are in the 40-50 range, so I'm basically a tasty snack at this point.
---
I have it on mage and proc works with shatter talent. If it counts as stun then it should also increase SoC judgement. Wierd.
---
54% of my server are undead/orc. I think it's mostly min-max culture, they want those sweet pvp talents.
---
Maybe it's not the same peoples saying those things ? World pvp was great only before p2
---
I mean if it's an alt and you spend some money keeping them geared up, warrior is a pretty smooth leveling experience
---
just watched a video of a rogue soloing.
---
&gt; If you're a person on a PvP server that isn't having fun and you're more casual, transferring to a different server shouldn't be an issue.
---
Character transfers aren't a thing on classic. Or did I miss something?
---
Not everyone correctly forecasted what a bloodbath this game would become once phase2 dropped. Also some people, like me, would select PVE but were persuaded to join a PVP server to be with friends.
---
Kinda sucks that the only option for these people is to cower in instances, reroll, or quit.
---
Lmfao
---
It might work but what if the addon can filter the distances?
---
agreed
---
p2 hasn't been rushed, the poll here showed 80% of players are in their 50s or 60. The poll here showed the majority think the timing is good or they don't mind it.
---
if anything content delay is part of the problem, mc and ony are faceroll easy so players end up with nothing to do on the nights they are waltzing through those two for loot.
---
that addon is called totemtimers
---
haha, nice!
---
Holy priest life with wanding
---
Hit, miss, resist, hit, resist, resist
---
Yeah soy sounds amazing hahaha. Thanks for the heads up OP
---
My friend did an MC pug with a 57 druid wielding Crescent Staff.
---
All rolling need on blue and epic boe items is new to classic.  When the game came out, if you were present when a big boe drop happened, you were lucky and would be the only one to roll need.
---
Otherwise, you should need anything you can wear and use and will be an improvement.  
---
That being said, I was in a group yesterday and somebody need rolled on an essence of undeath, only about (1g 80s) on my server, to make stuff for their guild mates.  This is not a valid reason to roll need.
---
i linked our gear in the youtube video description
---
These posts are pointless. We have no idea if you're lying and just trying to get people to rally to your cause.
---
[removed]
---
I encourage you to quit if you're so emotionally torn up. Or you know, if you're only doing SM like a basic noob bitch, just reroll on a PVE server.
---
yeah, i remember a vid of a solo warlock doing it
---
but he only showed bosses and had like aq 40 gear^^
---
i dont think [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) is accurate, it shows only \~5.5k active players in the last two weeks for my server(Arugal), yet my link shows 8k active 60's in the last two weeks. The problem is ironforge pro only takes data from warcraft logs.
---
the addon heal comm does that
---
I really wish more people would understand this. All the "Go go retail" and "you signed up for a pvp server why are you qq'ing" is due to grossly overpopulated servers which was not in Vanilla at all. So much of the problems we have been observing are directly tied to having too many people crammed into servers. Pls just let me pay for a realm transfer. Sincerely, a level 49 troll hunter on Faerlina who is internally and externally crying.
---
I run Affliction. 5/5 Suppression makes a huge difference. I do notice that my shadow bolts from Nightfall procs get resisted a ton (since it's from Destruction), but 3 levels above me, I hardly notice any effect at all. 4 above becomes inefficient to grind. 5 levels starts to be a nuisance.
---
A warrior pulling two equal-level mobs is wondering if he can run away in time to survive (or dropping a 30-min CD to win). If I end up agroing 3 mobs 2 levels above me, I just grumble about having to drink and maybe resummon a demon/healthstone afterward. I LOVE playing warrior, but the disparity in the soloing toolkit is ludicrous.
---
Ret paladin.  Currently have 77 HK's and 3500 honor.

Do a lot of people like hanging out with you in real life? Hows your girlfriend? Figure out which method is best to end it all yet? Cause you sound like you're a happy guy with a life worth living lmao.

Should fix your issue
---
- complain that server transfers should be faction specific so that balance improves
---
- complain that server transfers are faction specific
---
Battle chat message I think does this for me,        if I  /r to reply it also replies in blue instead of purple
---
I see a lot of complaint posts who describe exactly what a PVE server is for how they want the game to be, but then say they don't want a PVE server. It's confusing. I think some of the carebear type posts have influenced people or people just did not understand what a PVE server was.
---
After some paladin advice, i just hit level 55 and respecced. I plan on healing dungeons and doing some aoe farming from now on. I had enough gold to afford skullflame shield and have pretty decent gear for my level. 
---
Right now i have 21 points in holy and 21 in prot. My question is will i get more benefit from using my last 9 points to pick up reckoning and 1h spec in prot to help my dps while solo or should i use them to fill out the rest of the holy tree for 5% crit?
---
Im leaning towards using them in prot because at this stage im healing dungeons fine. Ive never speced into reckoning though so im not sure how effective it is.
---
In our guild's next Ony and MC runs, we're going to have 5 of our 10 healers as druids, out of 7 overall
---
Am I correct in thinking we have a lot more druids than normal?
---
This is literally what people have been crying for.
---
Now people cry because faction based transfers happened.
---
“Suck it up and just let us grief you. If you quit you’re a pussy”
---
ok good, i didnt see a post anywhere I looked, was freaking out a bit
---
Ticket system. Their website doesn't have a number I can call
---
more around 10x the size.
---
That is assuming player rates since that census hasn't drastically changed. (which it probably has)
---
The server caps now a day can hold roughly 50,000 players online at once spread over an area, back then it was 3,000 at the very limit.
---
I don't understand why anyone would roll on a pvp server.  15 years of regular wow would tell you that's going to be a bad choice.
---
Holy moly. See, not whining. He has a solution!
---
i already rerolled on another server, just stupid my mage is dead on this shitty que server
---
Needed UD strat for my priest. Grabbed 3 60 warriors and a lvl 56 shaman. We roflstomped the whole place. Just needed his windfury and tremor totems, but everything fell over. He died once and said all his gear was broken. He was a good sport, but, I would rather take someone more prepared.
---
bUT MUH SPY ADDON
---
Hindsight isn't a solution
---
Would you let your priest roll on Baron cape?
---
For rogues, the best pvp partner is a second rogue.
---
we can end the thread here.
---
Never done that for someone or have had that done for me
---
im 3/8's and im not even 60 yet. shit is def crazy, but hey no complaints here :p
---
Swords your level will be greens so nothing super special but i always try to go with a 2.6 or slower MH and a 1.7 or faster OH if you can. The MH is the most important one though because of SS hits. 
---
Hope i didnt sound like a jerk when telling you about daggers. I leveled a rogue to 60 once as daggers not knowing about how gimped they are without backstab - i hated it.
---
imagine how many liars customer support has to waste their resources on
---
Eyestalk Cors or Whipvine Cord for holy pallies?
---
Is the Robe of Volatile Power really better than Robes of the Exalted? I think its not.
---
"yeah i'm one of the best world pvp classes, geared, and on the dominant faction, but if you don't think tihs is fun you just shouldn't have rolled PVP LOL"
---
The level of denial is insane
---
Armour? I dont think that's true
---
&gt;Really not fair that Magic dmg is so much more effective than melee dmg.
---
C'mon now. You ever have to switch wands because a mob is 100% resistant to the wand's damage type? And don't get me started on how many mobs resist half of my holy spells. 
---
We holy priests understand your struggles. We are with you.
---
&gt; either directly or indirectly 
---
While it is impossible to tell if people who make these posts are innocent or not.... this line does scare me if that is an official quote from Blizzard.  Just how "indirect" can someone be and still catch a ban? 
---
Like what if someone buys gold, gets the gold in game, and immediate spends it all on one item in the AH? Since the person who sold the item in the AH is now ending the transaction with the gold bought with real money.... are they "indirectly" involved?
---
So you want to kill my buddies and not have to deal with the repercussions, is that it?
---
For raids, you want to be combat
---
For dungeons and general leveling, combat is better but hemo is still good enough.
---
Just hit level 51 on my Warlock a week ago and have not played it since P2 came out due to being an ally on a horde dominated server. Just been leveling a priest alt. What is the best way to get from 51-60 without having to quest? What dungeons should I hit at which levels?
---
That’s glorious my dude!!
---
I imagine on reddit this would be an insanely popular opinion.
---
Paladins are good now, but shamans take over in p5+.
---
I've asked this question before and not gotten a response.
---
When I log out while on a flight path, my chat channels get cleared. As in, I have to rejoin most of my channels including defaults like Lookingforgroup and world defense. It also removes world and lfg. I think the only channel that stays is /1. 
---
I'm currently using prat, but I know this has been happening since week 1 when I had no add-ons or just questie.
---
Has anyone else experienced this?
---
Is it a known bug or am I alone in this? 
---
The simplest fix is obv don't log in flight.
---
You can get honor from recently landed with mind control or sheep and wait.
---
Red Dragonscale BP is fairly cheap, 95% of Exalted, and better for MC. Not sure why it's ignored in BIS lists. 
---
Whipvine and Eyestalk are damn close.
---
I think you're pretty good at this game
---
I get that you're being jovial and I get the joke, but now nobodies gonna play anymore on the Alliance side and its gonna be boring for all of us. Kinda sad.
---
That guilds rolling in the dough
---
Shadow priest?
---
Thank you! Felt so good to get some revenge haha

---
That sounds fun and all, but why should anyone tell anyone else to have to do that? Why are people trying to convince other people to run a full melee group + heal to waste caster gear and have everyone roll on melee gear? Honestly that is really the dumb idea if anything, but I do a bunch of stupid shit, so like my original point, stop trying to tell other people how to play the game, not that you are, but OP is.
---
BOE greens need if need. BOE Blues are to be discussed if they are of value and if it's a significant upgrade/not worth much gold. BOE epics I ask everyone roll need so no one gets ninjaed.
---
48 is the minimum for honor so the horde 60s are getting something off me. Probably explains why I was relatively untouched at 47 and suddenly was getting camped left and right one level later lol. 
---
I’ll spend a little more time on fishing now. Makes sense. Even then, I need to put effort finding quiet pool areas. Feralas coastline where I was fishing yesterday is dangerous.
---
people are only complaining when theyre not the ones winning anymore. alliance like asmongold was insulting us and now cries cause he cant go anywhere without getting fucked.
---
I don't believe you
---
mad alliance crybaby
---
Feelsgoodman to be a Spriest. I just roam around all day doing 1v1's or even 2v1's and I barely ever lose. Getting 2-3x the amount of honor than my guildies and its more fun too
---
That was sweet
---
This is what DKs are supposed to help but they aren’t punishing enough to worry about.
---
Yeah, 2 MC runs in (8 bosses total) and i've got 3 T1 pieces...one raid i didn't even have competition.
---
Even if the ret pally does 0 damage his salv gives me 30% more damage.  Actually who am i kidding im not managing my threat in 5 mans
---
&gt; talking about absolutely perfect scenarios that only occur in a vacuum is fucking useless when it comes to PvPing
---
It's literally the only way to apples to apples discuss 1v1/classVclass. You aren't very bright.
---
You need that crit in holy. Without crit you'll go oom fast. Maybe when you're super geared and have a ton of crit from gear you could get rid of those points but, I wouldn't.
---
That was awesome, well played!
---
He wept and Mandos granted her wish.
---
This is also what scared me. Here is a screenshot of the email I received. This actually might be the case for me because I was making potions and selling them on the AH before I quit so I might have just gotten really unlucky. At this point, I do not see any other way I can appeal and plead my case
---

I don’t get it...

I love the design of Warriors in Classic so, so much. I love being a great 1A option at DPS and at Tank for endgame content. I love the granularity of knowledge you need about the game in order to properly min/max the character. I love the viability of all specs, I love the 'bully' feeling of playing arms and I love the rogue-adjacent feeling of playing fury.
---
Simply put Warrior is the most rewarding class in the game to play, in my opinion. The epic length of the journey makes the destination that much sweeter.
---
Yeah we had a 56 warlock we carried he was so grateful.  Said he just got cleaved non stop wherever he went.  They need to have bgs out yesterday.  Theres always just a line of horde camping dungeon instances and unless you wanna bring a big chunk of your guild out there and clean house its super annoying.
---
And then almost all PvP servers become effectively single-faction and everyone is unhappy that an iconic part of classic WoW is gonezo.  
---
Blizzard has the tools to aggressively deal with what's happening, maybe it's time to use them
---
I don't understand why but...
---
18.65% for the direct part, 63.63% for the HOT
---
Honestly, I'm tired of how overused that meme is but aside from responding to an actual baby boomer rant, this would have been the PERFECT application of that meme.
---
But I’m a mage
---
What the hell is a pallidan my zugzug brother?
---
Coward!
---
Its usually more ppl dont want to compete for certain drops
---
Oh damn, looks like we are the 2nd worst in terms of balance. That sucks :(
---
Most pvp realms can free transfer off, they don't have to re-roll.
---
They have really crumby healers, though.
---
"I shouldn't be forced to give that up because Blizzard can't balance the factions correctly."
---
I see this comment fairly often and I dont get the thought process behind it. How the fuck do you think blizzard has that much control over what server people choose?
---
If you thought this change applied to camps of normal mobs, did Solenor the Slayer seem like kind of an overly specific example?
---

I mean without gear and In the low levels you’re gonna run out of mana a lot. When you hit the higher levels you’ll have evocation and mana crystals and a bigger mana pool so it won’t be so bad.
---
I’ve been loving it too dude. All I have seen is people like us who are low-mid level, have other commitments and not a great deal of time to sink in to the game shitting on PvP.
---
Yesterday I got two Honor Kills on a Rogue at the same level. Today I got HKs on a Rogue 5 levels higher, and a Mage 3 levels higher - all in Duskwood (I’m 31 Rogue) just minding my own business - after they got me twice in a row.
---
Yeah I get ganked by level 60s, yeah it’s annoying at times, but it just adds another element to the game that’s actually enjoyable for me. When I’m out farming, I’m constantly spinning the camera round seeing if any Horde are charging towards me. Fuck I was in a group that I tried to RP our way out of trouble from 2 level 60s, including playing dead (insert Dinner for Schmucks gif) and even though it failed - it was much fucking fun!
---
Tomorrow I think I’m going to stock up on potions, and actively look for some PvP action.
---
Yeah, no. I didn’t. Blizzard did. Until this happened I never killed a 49. Now I kill every single one. I didn’t incentivize that.
---
For dm north/tribute runs Stealth actually increases aggro range since the dogs there have Stealth detection
---
Honestly this^.
---
It's a RPG. Do what makes you feel sexy.
---
Ooooooooh I see
---
The worst part is people calling you a whiner or saying group up. Yea lemme get every 40 in the game so we can go get wiped by the 30 lvl 60s at the FP waiting for me.
---
I assume addons have to use some sort of API to get combat log events/data. It wouldn't be too hard, I think, to restrict gathering combat log data outside dungeons. Although, I've heard Spy uses a bunch of other functions in addition, which could still possibly pose an issue.
---
Will I be able to to get into brd groups for gear? And what about raids?
---
Shaman is more fun to play.
---
Ive done lbrs probably hundreds of times and have never considered taking more than 5.... weird
---
&gt; I have been having fun doing the small scale kill teams 3-7 people
---
While that sounds noble, how many even fights have you found against other small groups. Chances are you only find solo players and gank them, which is really no different to ganking a &lt;60. Every 55+ zone has these groups roaming round fucking over people just trying to quest or level. I know pvp is part of the game, but it takes a lot of fun out it and forces you to dungeon grind.
---
That's a healthy level of investment in a video game! 
---
Every Horde player on Skeram actually chose for the Classic launch server balance issues to shake out this way. We also are directly responsible for the droves of your Alliance brothers who transferred away. So definitely direct that hatred at the responsible parties.
---
Lmao i blocked that guy  he was annoying as hell
---
I do wish honor was enabled while I was leveling up.  You can get that extra 10% discount for your epic mount when you hit 60 too.
---
When the nerds are cultured juuust right  👌😌
---
I use spy and I would be happy to see it go
---
This is why i play a tank
---
Go arms, that way you can survive a sneeze! Although if they cough or casually exhale in your direction it's still back to the graveyard
---
Did someone hurt you on your server or something? Someone trash talk you trying to join your group? Little context helps your post.
---
Man, you rock, I can't thank you enough for making this gear checklist! This is getting me super hyped for some Conflag pvp!
---
This game isn’t about fun. It’s about the big numbers and the... other big numbers
---
There is 0 risk that I will remain subscribed in order to play Shadowlands. I'm simply not interested in what WoW has become, even if they take steps to make it resemble the way it used to be. I'm here for classic and after I have my fill or Blizzard changes classic sufficiently to wreck the flavor it has relative to my pallet, I'll be gone.
---
Also there's a good chance I'll be gone as soon as Subnautica: Below Zero leaves early access.
---
Make the text box larger.  I just tried it out on my hunter and had a 4 digit number for arrows and it only shows two on my screen so it came out like 00
---
As a mage nearing 60, this video clearly demonstrates what im doing before every "nice dps" etc. I literally hit cone of cold once for 3-5k and routed all mana to arcane explosion while running around wildly.
---
If you're alliance and you're having wPvP problems, just transfer to Stalagg. Alliance here do a good job of being as disruptive as the Horde, even if they need more numbers. It's like all the babies left and the only ones who remain were planning for this from the very beginning (spoilers they were).
---
Because after 15 years if being the "good guys" and not getting laid for it, not even once, all the beta male virgins have finally decided to be the bad guys
---
I am in a similar situation as you. Never played Wow before classic chose alliance on a PvP server.
---
I don't mind dying but what makes me annoyed is the two minute timer it is punishing you for getting camped.
---
I had similar situation to you at lights hope chapel in plaguelands land immediately get jumped die repeat a bunch of times I couldn't even resurrect at graveyard because there were guys there too.
---
It got to the point I'd resurrect take maybe 5 steps then get killed and I'd have to wait two minutes repeat until I was far enough to hearth stone. It took me maybe 40 minutes. Not really my idea of fun.
---
If your on a PvP server prepare for some ganks no matter what. 51 is a good time to start BRD getting into the instance will give you trouble but it's not terrible.
---
Tbf it's really not hard to fill dps slots.  Kinda sucks to be the 58 hunter and ignoring someone just for responding to your ad is an asshole thing to do, but I get why they're holding out.
---
You don't have to remove them, just restrict to dungeons.
---
I prefer a stance dance macro, so I just press a button twice and it puts me into the stance and pops the ability. 
---
Then I dont have to manually change the stance. Same applies to zerker rage, overpower and the likes.
---
Happens on both sides.  I’m Horde on Yojamba and not once have I been ganked in a fair fight.  It’s either groups of 3 or greater, 5 levels or higher, or already engaged and waiting till low health.  But as people say, that’s PvP and you have to deal with it.
---
can you explain your thoughts here?  i haven't heard this one so much.
---
Thanks! But how do you know what items he use? i mean there is no name, just icons
---
I like that they are fast, but in turn seeing 3 misses in 3 seconds really ticks me off and half the time you cant even backstab so :/
---
It looks like a dick
---
Some have soured
---
warrior aoe?
---
DPS are a dime a dozen. Someone forming a group likely has multiple people whispering them for DPS spots. If the opportunity cost of inviting a 58/59 is not inviting a 60, then i’ll invite the 60 every time, simply to help the run go slightly more smoothly.

allowing 10k people on a realm designed for 2k was a massive change
---
Herod Alliance Gnome Mage... Stuck rerolling... Ha
---
PVE server detected.
---
The faction imbalance IS a problem, when you fly into any zone and are seeing literally a 20-30 man gank squad at every flightpoint, congrats you are dying 3+ times to get away. 
---
Signed up for pvp, this is not pvp.
---
Imagine not taking responsibility for your own actions
---
Sounds like you have mean friends if they didn't warn you that this was gonna happen. Every semi WoW veteran with a mediocre IQ knew ahead of time that P2 would become a complete meatgrinder.  
---
    
---
But there's light at the end of the tunnel, so hang in there - the moment Battlegrounds become available you won't have to spend more time in the Shadowlands than on Azeroth lmao xD
---
&gt; When PvP is at its peak, paladins will support premades to R14
---
This may be news to you, but you don't compete with paladins for RP.
---
Ive done subt main combat off from 10 to 49 so far, and its great. I have almost no down time because between ghostly strike and riposte, i either dont take any damage, or i take very little damage. Lmk if you want my spec. I think its also probably more fun and interactive compared to combat sword.
---
Yeah completely bitch made. Crying for 1v1s when you win them like 80% of the time with the same combos
---
noice. I'm an old protadin rolling warrior for the first time. Didn't know they had AOE
---
Woah there, calm down buddy.
---
Omg right, playing alliance on Herod is an utter fucking joke rn.
---
Ditto. My friends all stopped playing because they got fed up of PVP and I rolled PVE after they left. Having a great time and my PVP realm Warlock can gather as much dust as she wants, there's very little at this point to convince me going back is a good idea, even if I still have 20 levels to catch up.
---
right, they could change stuff, but the point i think myself and others make as to why they dont need to remove this add-on is because any player is able to open their combat log and look at all these things. 
---
just like how i like to see in my scrolling combat text when i crit on a white swing, which if i just read the combat log i could gather that data myself, but it is just a QoL that they are asking to remove, which is not a valid reason to most of us.
---
A lot of the Horde on Kiritonos think it's a blast. Ask my level 34 lock that hasn't gained a level in 3 days of play. I hope the Ally/Horde players doing this realize this is gonna lessen the number of people playing and stop. Pretty sure I'm cancelling my sub till something changes.
---
Thats not how skillcap works buddy. Skillcap is about how good you can get at something, not how difficult it is.
---
Sure warriors are weak as hell, so you need to be good to win duels, but that doesn't mean you have crazy difficult moves with huge skill expression like rogue does. Warrior is incredibly simplistic one of the lowest skillcap classes in fact, especially in 1v1s. The hardest part of warrior is actually positioning and target calling which is 5v5 or larger thing only.
---
Guessing you're horde
---
If it’s any consolation my roommate bubbles me at the same time I use ice block about 85% of the time
---
Because “feelings”
---
How often can you turn in the Head of Onyxia quest? Every time I try to turn it in the head is already up. How long after the last person turned in do we have to wait?
---
Because RNG forces you to repeatedly run content for gear
---
Pvp when you are looking for pvp soo good when you are not very expensive replacing your keyboard/mouse.
---
World pvp is amazing... if you're a rogue. Everyone else has to group up to get less honor and either risk getting overrun by larger groups, or form even bigger groups to get even less honor. When one class has such a clear advantage over everbody else, it's no wonder they rushed to release a solution that gave everyone equal opportunity (BGs were added a month and a half after honor system), and should do so again in classic.
---
is that kakyoin?
---
They were in classic right before tbc launched. And the biggest problem with world pvp is the 5x pop cap anyways.
---
It’s cute watching people convince themselves there’s an actual difference between faction players. At least the RP’ers know they’re role playing.
---
Wind fury is definitely better for clear times
---
If you don't understand what I said you should reread. I'm not going to repeat it.
---
Afaik the honor for a target is split between all parties attacking said target at least to a degree. Even you arent in a party and tag someone in south shore. If another pvp raid tags it the honor will still be split. It's generally more effective to roam with a group of 5 and fight randoms and other small groups but that tends to end with 1 side calling in 15+ people to the area and steam rolling. Then the people retreat and the side with 20 people calls the group of 5  pussies who only fight when they have more people. Eventually after going zone to zone for a while it ends up with the group going to hillsbrad for approximately 11 minutes before group gets off to get food(masturbate).
---
Why are you even playing on a PvP server if you don’t want to PvP? It makes no sense. What are you going to use your PvP reward gear for, trivializing your PvP content even faster? I’m starting to think you don’t even realize how pointless it is to trivialize PvP for rewards you’re not going to even use because your targets never fight back. Big yikes, bro.
---
Sure you did.
---
How am I part of the problem?
---
Cries in druid
---
Alliance do this to Horde too.
---
I just think it's ridiculous to see all these posts about they don't like how other people play the game (spell cleave, reserving items, asking for certain classes) and the most annoying part is that it's due their lack of knowledge on the game, not the other player. I've done spell cleave with one group, and now they are my friends. I reserve items for friends because we want to look for people who want to take the other things, like bringing in level 52 casters to get BR because we had all melee already rolling against eachother for one item. I have asked for specific classes so that we can get something done in a realistic manner, like torch room or Baron Rivendare fight. So many fights people think are so easy, because they were in a group led by someone who realized they needed the right class.
---
You play horde you're corpse running probably 10% of the time I am
---
Oh, man. People think it's gonna get better with battlegrounds? Solo players are gonna have their skulls kicked in by full premades on voice decked out in Bis gear and bags full of consumables. The PvP isn't gonna get less miserable unless you're part of one of the death squads.
---
And, obviously, the PvE never gets interesting.
---
Doesn’t matter what spec you are, you wouldn’t hold threat consistently against that.
---
You never did the classic rank pvp and it shows.
---
Some dicks were sapping allies as theyd land in thorium point last night, waiting 30 seconds then killing for Honor. 
---
I broke sap 3 times with my wand to help these people run off. It worked at first then the toxic motherfuckers on my team just started killing immediately. They were pissed at me and I was glad to see some horde asshole crying.
---
I'm sorry my factionmates are jerks.
---
I meant exactly what I stated. It won't be banned because the API call that SPY uses to function is used by hundreds of other addons and will not be disabled due to one addon.
---
I'm not going to sit here and explain how the WoW API and LUA system that addons run on works.
---
But fuck those 58's lol. Don't need those guys
---
I’m pretty sure each successful auto attack generates 20 energy. And any blocked/dodged/parried spell refunds half the energy back.
---
CoC has a talent that boost its damage by 15%+
---
Idk man I died 9 times on my way to scholo yesterday but it gave me 40 minutes to appreciate how much I love classic and hate retail.
---
Still one of my proudest achievements of vanilla, and I was a warrior main (my guild started allowing alts on MC so we could always give a priest/hunter a new weapon).
---
Best quest/chain IMO. Even more so than Linken, Ony attunement, and the AQ event race.
---
I dunno, I think some of it is due to the older age demographic.
---
When WoW first came out half the kids playing just picked a nelf hunter because LOTR was cool and new and they wanted to be legolas.
---
Now that young group had probably matured their tastes or wants to play horde for gameplay reasons.
---
Could you elaborate? Honestly not quite sure what you mean. 
---
As it currently stands blizzard will release all PvP gear in its final form, all items included. Paladins will absolutely want to go all the way for the mace that only gets replaced by the C'thun mace and its 15% drop chance.
---
Yeah there's more targets for you but if you somehow manage to find a 1v1 fight then they will call for reinforcements and you'll get camped
---
"...wack."
---
I’m on Rattlegore, Horde, and never once encountered this issue. Sorry that my other fellow 58/59 folks have to deal with this BS.
---
lmaoooooo
---
Was there a meme or something I missed? Why is everyone parroting 'sunk cost fallacy' lately. 
---
That doesnt really apply here
---
Hillsbrad as we have seen it will be over after reset. No one is going to risk a DK next week. Might be some battles at the tower but may as well move to thorium point and avoid the DK risk completely. Also people are slowly realizing that max honour is not obtained in large battles like that and you learn very little pvp skills in those battles so I expect the meta will change.
---
Hunter dps has a decently high floor due to a lower hit cap and no glancing blows/party etc.
---
However hunter scaling with agi to crit / AP is poor and weapon availability is horrible so while you pick up with some gear you will constantly fall behind as other classes gear up.
---
Anyone who farms preraid BIS and uses their consumables well will beat most hunters easily enough if they play decently.
---
Also this guy above is claiming like rank #1 and #2 parses as what he normally does for Ony so take what he says with a grain of salt.
---
Yeah lol imagine pressing 2 instant cast abilities that do a combined 2600 damage to any target over time and Your only job is to run away or pop a LIP
---
Should have rolled on a streamer servdr
---
Love the amount of hostility people enjoying wpvp brings lol
---
They have more then enough money to have better servers but there shareholders are their #1 priority.
---
&gt;Yes I'm a gearmaxxed level 60 Horde (mage) if you wonder. I'd still have fun with bad gear or as Alliance
---
I'm sure you do son, i'm sure you do.
---
Thank you for the big response
---
Yea, you should probably look up Death Coil.
---
They're not remotely hardcore and definitely didnt play when classic was first released. There's no way they could have known. Plus it's not like they could have known which servers woulda be imbalanced
---
I actually SWAPPED to a PvP server because of this subreddit. Mine's honestly not so bad at all, but I do wish now I'd have gone at least RP-PVP
---
Heartseeker. Roughly 2 to 1 Ally to horde, it's pvp and a lot of ppl to play with, it's an east coast server but I'm also on mountain time and depending on how late you stay up to play the evenings die down a bit making it easier to farm
---
Can gankers also craft a dreamcatcher out of the gut fibers of their hapless victims to guard against whiney ghosts?
---
Familiar with icons. Thats the spider belt one.
---
why is grid2 so fucking hard to learn? and the last full guide was written for a previous version so there is fucking elements that arent even covered.
---
Why is there no chance? They banned the looking for group addon which in my opinion is 10x worse for the game as far as "classic experience" goes. I
---
Best way is probably don't spam it, just asked in general chat for the area if anyone can help by taking a survey.
---
Don't be surprised if no one takes you up on the offer.
---
Even better way would be if you already had a guild to ask to do it who know you, I personally wouldn't be doing some randoms survey and clicking on posted in game links.
---
click on the little + sign on the left and go to "join channel"
---
more like 4
---
I myself am on biggles alliance too...let’s just say i am re rolling. Too many horde and too little alliance that are fine being the betas.
---
At max level if they're spamming for a mage only often it's because the group wants free water/food.
---
I run the addon on my main (currently level 38), but it still shows up as a level 33 from about 10 days ago, although Ive uploaded my scans in the last day or two. Why does the "/cr scan" not scan yourself?
---
You sound like you have a lot of friends in real life.
---
Blue pvp shoulders give +1%spell crit, I'm planning to use them and some other blue pvp item for +23 spell dmg bonus supported by mc and ony gear
---
Uhm, lol....so like you do know that honor and rank earned now counts just as much in the future when bgs exist right. I dunno why you’re so easily triggered over the fact that a 49 in a party gives 60ish honor
---
Implement faction caps or faction specific queues. They've been making this game for 15 years and you're telling me that this idea has never come up? Clown
---
&gt; I spent a lot of time &lt;sinking a cost&gt; into thing, so even though I could do better thing I can't abandon the time I have sunk
---
Literally sunk cost fallacy.
---
If you only focus on things horde are better at, yeah sure that's what you'll think.
---
Just jump between two columns at a time. BRD is cake town.
---
I'm having such a hard time, level 54 seems like the worst. Mara and ST not good enough exp 
---
Cant quest anywhere because of ganking...what do. Ungoro is fucked
---
It depends.
---
For example, I'm a druid. I can use a lot of things. But something might just be a slight upgrade and I don't want a pure class to miss out.
---
So I'll ask if I'm too lazy to look through chat to see if everyone greeded, I just don't want to make a mistake.
---
And any tradeable item worth 20g or more should be needed, because it's worth the same to everyone.
---
Azshara Beach.
---
"You killed a civilian? Not cool! How is he supposed to fight back!?"
---
37 dudes stomp on my throat before I even have a chance to react.  
---
"Yeah that's probably fine."
---
then what was the reason to play on a pvp server in the 1st place, to NOT pvp?
---
I'm doing the same as you brother
---
400ish from some of the screenshots I've seen posted here
---
Well if you were on Grobb this weekend (last week maybe it all blends together) I was a 60 priest that got invited and watched a lowbie priest get kicked. 
---
The group broke up before we entered the dungeon because the tank was not a nice person.
---
You don't have to disable the API call you could just change what the endpoint returns.
---
Just trying to spread positivity.
---
Triggered.
---
Bigglesworth
---
Can the mods please start removing posts like this? Anyone with half a brain knew phase 2 on PvP servers would be aids. I’m bored of every second post on this sub being crying about how people can’t play.
---
Or just play something else for a few weeks instead.
---
To play with my friends? AKA the best reason there is to play this game. Plus it's not even possible for Alliance to pvp. We just get outnumbered and corpse camped. Sounds so much fun right?
---
Of course, this game is really fun. Why wouldn’t you?
---
im at 38 with my warrior and i have like twice the buttons lol
---
they give a lot. I just want to quantify exactly how much; to see if its worth doing over roaming squad pvp. or hillsbrad meta.
---
Lmao you think the horde give a fuck about honor
---
You are getting gang banged for fun
---
Because this time everybody knows the game like the back of their hand, or have resources readily available. A ton of people I know go horde either for the better PVP racials or because the questing experience is easier/better (Like having barrens)
---
Only if ghosts can leech 1 honor from the 1-3 honor you would get from your 1337 pvp raids killing defenseless lobbies
---
Only helps melee though
---
Yeah not only is the GM clueless so is the person submitting the ticket.
---
You're speaking as if the population can't change and is always going to be 70% Horde, 30% Alliance. There are people who are indifferent to which faction they choose and an incentive to roll Alliance would nudge them in that direction. There will be people who are willing to roll Alliance if it means they have shorter queue times. At this point though, it might be too late. Faction queues should have been implemented at launch.
---
That's usually level 55/56
---
Google "generalization" and try to figure out why your argument and reasoning is faulty.
---
Yeah Free Action Pot is key here. Without it they'll shut you down after your first nova very quickly. They are constantly spamming macros with auto target, you'll get CCd with insane reaction time.
---
Depends on how many DK you get from people AOE'ing everything
---
Dont re sub. If horde dominate your server you won't be able to level past 40 for the foreseeable future.
---
I feel ya. Unsubbed for now (ending tomorow) and i'll check back in later. It's just not fun anymore.
---
Yeah, we ran into a group of 2 druids and a hunter with our 2 man of me (hunter) and shadow priest. Absolutely shit canned them twice, then the 3rd time we see them they are in the ally zerg running around. 
---
Not even just talking shit or anything, I really think the people running around in raid groups are doing it because they are bad.
---
Read the Silmarillion, it's amazing.
---
They should have kept the server size the same as Vanilla, with an eye toward server merges down the road.
---
10,000 split amongst all raid members. They gave zero before Thursday morning.
---
why post here? This is Blizzard, not Jagex
---
Did you write his name down? That's the sort of thing that would blacklist that person for me. Once I hit 60 and start healing PUGs, if he showed up I'd just peace out (I'm not so arrogant as to demand someone else's removal from a group). I haven't been keeping a shitlist for Classic *yet*, but something like that would definitely kickstart one for me.
---
The only saving grace would be if the replacement was from the same guild as the rest of the group and they let me know with an apology or similar.
---
Open a Finder window.
---
Open your Applications directory.
---
Open the World of Warcraft directory.
---
Open the Interface directory (The WTF folder is also located here)
---
In the Interface directory, open the Addons folder.
---
Empty the contents of the Addon folder to the Trash.
---
They aren't going to overhaul what that API returns because it effectively also breaks all those other addons.
---
Spy is here to stay. People just need to either quit already, or stop bitching about it and suck it up.
---
Haha spot on mate
---
You need to calm down and stop getting offended over something completely non-offensive.
---
Go for a walk outside perhaps?
---
So far, the only time I've felt camped as a house was in the booty bay inn with the horde flight path. Warriors could jump and hit me through the floor and no guard aggro. Otherwise, they just camped me on the stairs by the bunk beds.
---
Soul Link Warlock.
---
I’ve been fighting things at my level the whole way through, on two characters, and back in the day too. Isn’t this how the game was intended?  
---
I mean I don’t fight oranges (unless I’m on my warlock and have something to prove). I know greens make it faster and easier, but fighting mobs my level seems pretty straightforward.
---
oh no i forgot the FP at bullwark was not added to cata
---
doesn't change my point at all
---
you can enter WPL from a save zone, where chillwind is camped nearlyt 24/7
---
Honestly there's nothing wrong with the PvP servers. It's just that a lot of people are babies and shouldn't have rolled on one.
---
I'm on the outnumbered faction on a PvP server and I am having an absolute blast.
---
Exactly. It's not fun at all for Alliance. I cant wait for servers to die and hear all of the posts complaing
---
#nochanges
---
you think you want it but you dont
---
pls preorder shadowlands btw
---
Horde or UD rather was actuallly the only race with a racial in the start
---
well if you had brought a REAL dps intsead of that feral, you would have downed the mobs faster and your healer wouldn't have **needed** an innervate.
---
What's your faction balance? I dont believe you died 9 times when there's a graveyard 2 minutes away from the dungeon
---
Yeah I love the thrill of a close match where me and the enemy barely got the other, and the other one is hurrying to a safe spot to drink and wait for them to rez so they don't get jumped. The excitement of eeking out a win, or BARELY losing and harboring a grudge the next time you find them. The back and forth. Or even the battlegrounds where there's a concentrated effort, and your friends and allies are coordinating a way to punch through the final defenses. Those Long shot plays where there's no WAY it'll work, and then it does. Being dead to rights in the middle of nowhere when you see a Hunter's Mark appear over the Rogues head mid-gank and realize the tables just turned. THAT'S the fun of PVP. THAT'S the thrill of it all.
---
Five 60s shitting down my throat is exactly what I hate retail PVP. "You literally cannot stop me from ruining your fucking day" is not what I want from PVP.
---
Damn, just looked at your comment history, you hav got to be the most unhappy, bitter, resentful, spiteful person I've ever seen on Reddit. I found the loser you were talking about earlier, go look in the mirror
---
You can bug them out using a ledge and handle Angerforge by abusing riposte.
---
I rolled with friends who joined before me
---
Yo GZ, I've seen you guys a few times. One of your rogues decided to keep calling me a druid and telling me to buff him. Funny lad.
---
But I want instant queues when bgs come out
---
I always thought it was polite to ask about needing on BoEs for upgrades.
---
&gt;They made /who a protected function to try and break the Classic Census addons, but this change also made /who a protected function in Retail too.
---
No see, you are confused - People were trying to compare active populations between classic and retail, so blizzard broke it game-wide.
---
Right, because grenades and engineering arent meta right now
---
I was in the same position brother. Just wanting to go with what I liked, not really considering the optimization that everyone likes to talk about in these kinds of threads. 
---
The truth is though, for leveling, swords are nicer - just purely because of that top end damage. I didn’t put any points into sword, mace, or dagger spec. But I’m usually running either two swords, a sword and a mace, or a sword and a dagger. Swords are just widely abundant.  
---
But make no doubt, when I hit 60 I’m rolling back to daggers :D
---
I was disgusted by all the people fucking doing nasty shit like this. I don't get it. It REALLY bothers me. People are quitting over this. Yeah, it's the opposing faction, I get it, but these people are getting so fed up they are quitting. 
---
I'd be so sad if a group of people wanted to ruin this game for me like that. The amount of nasty things these horde said to me was astonishing. These people forget there's someone on the other side of the screen.
---
Although Horde has a couple of notably strong individual racials Alliance honestly just have the better overall stack.
---
- Escape Artist
---
- Stoneform
---
- Expansive Mind
---
- Mace/Sword Spec (Two in one! Also sword spec is better for warriors than Axe Spec in both PvE and PvE as the proc is multiplicative with crits, provides more rage overall and provides better burst in PvP)
---
- Perception
---
- Diplomacy (saves hundreds of hours farming gold/cloth and grinding rep mobs)
---
- Shadowmeld
---
- Wisp Spirit (again, colossal time-saver over time)
---
Hardiness is good but nowhere near as strong as people make it out to be.
---
WotF is the single most overrated ability in the game. All it's good for is letting rogues gank 2 classes easier and giving those two classes a slight upper hand in mirror fights. Mages lose to them anyways and warriors already have Berserker Rage and they still lose to warlocks/spriests 99 times out of 100.
---
Berserking and Warstomp are both solid overall but people are too busy massively overhyping hardiness/wotf to acknowledge them
---
And tauren's HP racial is nice but every alliance race has it thanks to blessing of kings.
---
Blood fury is nice but a couple hundred extra melee AP is *not* worth MSing yourself for 30 seconds
---
The two factions are *very* close overall, but hey, hardiness and wotf are literally the most gamebreakingly OP abilities in the entire game, amirite?
---
See, that’s what I thought when I was that level. I was like “idk what people are talking about. This isn’t even that bad” because I’d find the occasional horde my level questing or the random 60 running through. Once you hit 48 it becomes a whole new ballgame. Especially once you get into the 50-60 leveling zones where raid groups of horde are running through camping flight paths and making leveling literally impossible. My friend and I even played together one night. After 6 hours of playing we maybe got 5 bars.
---
BRM is between Ironforge and Stormwind and you have an underground tram.
---
The thing with lvl 59 and 58 is they take all the loot because “it’s an upgrade” usually people in their 60s want to make money off their runs.
---
haha they are living up to the wow stereotype beautifully.
---
The same is true of BRM as well. There isn't 200 people there anymore, more like 20-30 total.
---
Meta shifts or not, there's just less people fighting now.
---
T_T  
---
WHYYYYYYY!?  
---
lol as I type this I am logging in for run 91...  
---
Someone kill me.
---
If you look up water essence on wowhead and you head down into the comments. This specific info has been publicly available since 2006.
---
I'm already at the auction house
---
Honestly this is exactly what's happening, people are grouping in massive raids thinking that killing more people nets them more honor, so they look for the absolute safest, most braindead way of killing people.
---
Once a week or 2 goes by and people realize that even if they've camped flight masters 10 hours a day, they're still only rank 2/3 because they're getting piss all honor, people will get bored and go do small pvp squads, which is exactly what world pvp should be about.
---
Agree, I don't recall many huge battles. I always rolled with 5-10 people doing random zones or hang out in searing gorge solo. My favourite was stealthing close to a major city and sniping people after they finished dueling but spy has ruined that one.
---
When I played Vanilla WoW, the first time around, during non-Raid nights we ran minimum requirement toons through all the attunement dungeons. I think we could take as low as 56 for Scholomance and Blackrock Spire. 
---
Like, why wouldn’t you?
---
You lose time. Which is the rarest and most valuable resource anyone has access to.
---
Uhhhh this isn’t true, maybe when you’re level 55+ but not this is not at all the case for the bulk of leveling. I’ve done it twice so if you wanna talk about any specific portions of the leveling process..., either way, rogues can absolutely not take on 3 mobs usually. Two is a trial until you get blade furry, if you do.
---
Just swim below the surface and no problem
---
this is my swamp
---
Horde die the moment they land in Lights hope.Its funny thinking all servers same alliance has the numbers on many
---
https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/windows.html
---
As a hunter I can't relate to these experiences at all but damn if you didn't give me a true appreciation for the warrior class right there. That was awesome. Maybe I will give tanking a go someday...
---
huh, TIL!
---
Lol. Oh shit. He’s onto us. Lol jk. I’m ally.
---
There's a massive, massive different from not being able to do the content you want to do, and not being able to play the game at all. Faction Based Server queues would probably kill Classic as people would cancel their subs instantly.
---
Best part is all the whiners downvote so you can't even participate in the discussion
---
https://i.imgur.com/4adjXFW.png
---
You have literally no right to say this as someone who is max geared, let alone lvl 60 lmao. Its a complete fucking nightmare leveling. I even left in game feed back telling them to release bgs asap because it is so fucking ass leveling. You have no life alliance players literally camping the feralas bridge all day.
---
Glad to hear it. Lok'Tar Ogar
---
Does Carrot on a Stick, Mithril spurs, etc. still make the epic mount faster?
---
I would have to disagree as a leveling alliance player. I see roughly 3 times as many horde in any given zone. Maybe more honestly
---
Enjoying pvp like you should :-) Same here ,many great and fun duels on 60
---
noooo, blizzard didnt know, man, they are just a small up and coming company, they had no idea how popular world of warcraft would be, thats why they only started out with 2 pvp servers on each region. they had no idea!
---
Literally people rolling on a PvP server, on the minority faction, and wanting to punish people who happened to roll Horde. Like do they think in any world Blizzard will basically say fuck you to the vast majority of their players? Some realms that are like 70/30 would just die overnight.
---
Lol dude maybe there was one raid forming to go into Mc. Alliance have brm camped out. I had to die and rez nearly 15 times to get to MC Sunday night. It’s disgusting
---
Ahh that makes more sense, my bad too.
---
Then u get no rested xp
---
It's just the smarter way to level if you plan on having more than one 60. 
---
You make your mage first since they can speed through the leveling process easily, and just pull gold out of thin air whenever they need it. Then you make your warrior, and it's way easier because you have gold to twink him out while leveling, and maybe some 60 friends from your guild who are willing to boost you.
---
&gt; The two factions are very close overall, but hey, hardiness and wotf are literally the most gamebreakingly OP abilities in the entire game, amirite?
---
Given how you compared it to Perception and Diplomacy... yes?

I dont get 6 figures to come up with a solution, big heads at blizzard do. Other's mentioned faction-wide que, and i'd be totally down with that, servers would balance themselves out.

I'd also change BG's so that on the already overpopulated servers they wouldnt be xrealm.

Make a macro so it uses the stone first if you have one and if not uses your health pot and just use the health pot icon.

Okay, cocksmoker.
---
I switched to this PvP build at 30 because I play for PvP exclusively, and it showed in my dungeon damage output and speed. You’ll have rogues tell you occasionally that you’re doing it wrong, but who gives a fuck, it’s your time, and people will include you no less.
---
I wouldn’t have done things any differently, and I just got to level 55, o hopefully this is a helpful anecdote.

How do i upvote this multiple times?
---
Then don't do it...why sign up for a group and then afk it on the basis that you're bored with the content?

I heard it's every 6 hours.
---
Seems like a horde favoured server as well. Not one of the bad ones but bad enough. Can I ask what gear you have? Are you MC, pre bis? fresh 60?
---
On firemaw within the last 7 days, 
---
2535 Horde lvl 60 characters seen.
---
1441 Alliance lvl 60 characters seen.
---
1.76 ratio favouring Horde.
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4467\_Firemaw](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4467_Firemaw) 
---
I play on Arugal and its not even the worse server but is nearly unplayable.
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4669\_Arugal](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4669_Arugal) 
---
On Arugal within the last 7 days,
---
4775 Horde lvl 60 characters seen.
---
1849 Alliance lvl 60 characters seen.
---
2.58 ratio favouring Horde.
---
I dont believe this to be entirely accurate as the larger pop faction is more likely to have more active data and thus producing a larger dataset but I can say from ingame feel it 100% feels like a 2:1 ratio.
---
When the ratio is this bad, alliance players get sick of being snowballed everywhere, they stay in towns or log onto alts, making the ingame ratio feel even worse.
---
As a result horde players become more bored and you get things like town pillaging/camping, FP camping, and even low level player corpse camping/griefing. Its a vicious snowball.
---
Ive not seen deadmines and westfall so populated since launch week.
---
I just switched to swords and my god its so much nicer
---
No fuck no.Let people enjoy world pvp more as many are atm.Activision needs to stop rushing,hell rushing phase 2 caused issues also as many werw not prepared

Everybody is dying man. Not just 50+ lol.

---
Didn't you hear OP?? This is YOUR fault for not being able to hit 60 in 80 days!!
---
Good read mate.
---
 I just started this last night and was definitely asking myself if it's hard or am I just a bad hunter.
---
The problem isn't the level, but the name. I have already rerolled, but I had to give up the perfect name
---
Yeah I love to have to place my buffs every view meters. So fun.
---
You can absolutely dps any and all dungeons and even top the chart. You can dps raids but you will be almost certainly the lowest, especially so if you’re totem twisting the top melee group . You will be using the same gear as rogues/dps wars so be prepared for competition.  No tier gear as well since it’s all resto stats. It’s mainly finding a chill guild. IMO it’s fine to bring a few meme specs but too many and you’re severely hampering the raid.
---
Keep in mind it’s 25% less honor per kill on the same person in a 24 hour period but it doesn’t display in estimated honor.
---
Where is the everlook and BB auction houses? I'm lvl 60 and only ever found the gadget one, lol.
---
Replace the 48 alt with my 31 main and yup, that's my experience.
---
For greens it's always need if you actually need it.
---
For boss drops need of you need.
---
For BoE rares/epics it's everyone needs. Too many people will try and "need" expensive upgrade/twink pieces but they'll just sell them.
---
I went deep prot and got tank geared quick. Concussive blow and 20 rage shield slam make tanking a loooot easier than the 0/31/20 fury build. Stayed prot to farm fury pre-bis, though I had to go fury/prot to start raiding. Now that I’m only missing 2-3 pre-bis fury pieces, I finally went full fury. 
---
Full prot def makes dungeon tanking a lot better, nothing beats a 5s stun if you know the mob will die before it falls off so you can build higher threat on the other mobs, shorter taunt cd etc
---
Westfall eh? Bout time I hear of my server for once with all this pvp nonsense stealing the spotlight.
---
If you and the 5 others stack on each other everyone that gets hit is almost certainly dead :)
---
Whenever they attack me and I have no chance of winning like high level or no health I just cross my arms and wait, occasionally I'll throw a /clap
---
Got a stack of deamfoil for 1g 60s. Almost felt bad, but if not me it would be someone else.
---
Same here had rogue warr priest hunter shaman we couldn't get past the torch room but everything else up to there was cake
---
I think you two need to get married now...

---
I was about to say something similar... usually the only downtime on those runs was waiting for charge cds
---
They are doing the better thing though, not playing WoW is pretty great when you're burnt out on it like many people have lately.
---
He's not wrong.
---
(still no ret pallys though)
---
I know they do, but I think by the time bwl has been out for a few months, they'll be commonplace.  Most of the mc pugs right now are 4/10-8/10.  At least that's the case on my server.
---
I leveled as combat swords to 55 and have just switched over to CB/hemo. I got bored with combat. Hemo has been refreshingly fun, but I definitely do less damage in pve and I miss blade flurry for quickly killing 2 mobs at once. In pvp it's stupidly good, which has been a godsend with phase 2 out.
---
I'd say if you want to get to 60 asap stick with combat, but if you want to spend time pvping and are happy to kill mobs 1 at a time while leveling then hemo is a refreshing change.
---
He just wants you to reach 48 faster.
---
true but I think the 'problem' would still exist. with horde being favored.
---
Ok what solution jackss.
---
Rools?
---
I dont play the game anymore but here's a pro tip. If you jump on the outside ledge, and run around the right edge of the room, there's specific spots you can reset aggro and not go into combat to heal up and drink. Happy exploiting.
---
Now report him for communication with the opposing faction.
---
The armor is good against all physical classes making it a solid dependable ability.
---
What makes it amazing though is the poison/bleed/disease immunity cleanses and prevents a wide variety of very powerful abilities from a wide variety of classes.
---
Off the top of my head there's:
---
- Crippling Poison
---
- Mindnumbing Poison
---
- Wound Poison
---
- Deadly Poison
---
- Viper Sting
---
- Serpent Sting
---
- Rupture
---
- Garrote 
---
- Devouring Plague (undead priest racial that heals them and damages you)
---
- Rake
---
- Rip
---
- Rend
---
It's easily the most versatile PvP racial that benefits the widest variety of classes against the widest variety of classes.
---
LOOKS LIKE IM REPOSTIN' LATER
---
Here is what I have so far. 
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/sgaAU48oicWQSbqM7TfCbs/set/sgdjSbzDqkVCBDgyipRcLj
---
A few things. This list is tailored specifically for me, because I honestly never planned on showing this to anyone. This isn't the BEST POSSIBLE, but instead the realistically best based off how I play. 
---
With that said, I have this list set for what I know I can do/grind. Based off of private server experience, Rank 10/11 may be the highest I ever see, so the results match that. It turns out that a lot of the T1 set beats out the pvp blue set in terms of Stam, If I have T1, that means that has higher stam than the pvp blue option.
---
I value STAM the highest, that is personal preference.
---
Also I'm toying with trying out a tanking item or two in the Neck or..back.. or maybe one of the ring slots to get my stam higher, or maybe there is an interesting tanking trinket that is easy to get, and would be useful for surviving in a pvp situation? 
---
Other thing is I opped not to include world boss drops, because those are pretty contested and not easy for me, if world bosses are easy for you I would replace https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18510/hide-of-the-wild with https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18208/drape-of-benediction.
---
Also this might sound crazy...but Anathema has been interesting to heal in. I gimp my heals yes, but I get more stam/regen. Also I notice I've been ignored as a first focus target in small skirmishs because the enemies think I'm full dps. 
---
I'll say again this is an extreme work in progress.
---
haha, horde player talking af if this is unusual, dude, every single horde favored server the same thing happens
---
You just discovered melee-cleave groups.  The cooler of the “cleave” setups.
---
Me a long ways from home mon
---
I believe you, I believe everything I see on the internet.
---
Well, we know the exact % of players that will be stuck at each rank, and given our current population, there's still going to be a lot of players that keep climbing.
---
This makes me feel just slightly better.  Happy Cake Day, btw!
---
Well looks like I am one lucky mothertrucker in this case then
---
I havnt tried but a few guildies swear by their shaman a being able to tank. I've seen them be able to do it up to ST. But havnt seen any past that.
---
I could see an enhance shm rolling on a good stat shield if they were going 1h (like ironfoe) but I wouldn't roll need if I was with a warr who also needed.
---
Portals and water. Turn Mana into gold!
---
That's what you get for rolling a gnome mage
---
we need to start a group for the people who can not  admit to themselves they should not have picked a pvp server
---
Had the same problem, honor was counted the very next day, so wait 24h and try again.
---
I was having fun, regardless of how my face looked lol
---
I'm not against 58s and 59s being in the group, but after 10+ Scholo runs and not even seeing the wand, I would definitely prefer 60s for a faster run
---
Just cancel the sub, it is impossible to level.
---
they clearly STILL dont understand why people like classic if they think that would work. no way im trying shadowlands.
---

---
You just need to convince people you are one of the rare hunters who knows how to kite, trap, and dismiss pets before jumping. Oh, and that you never open with multishot. You can only blame other hunters for your bad reputation.
---
This guy knows what's up. No boss in current content hits worth a damn. I tanked with 308 defense and have 0 issues. So I gather up the mitigation pieces from raid rather than spend gold on them.
---
Do you ask every person you talk to if they play retail?  Cuz thatd be weird.
---
I don’t know a subscription is a subscription to Activision/Blizzard other then the sale of the game itself they still make money so I don’t really see the huge conspiracy. People will just naturally gravitate to the style of play they prefer.
---
Nothing hostile about my response mate, no need to be so defensive.
---
And yes, pugs will be shit people sometimes. It happens. How does that in any way change what I said?
---
Stay arms. Respec prot for your very first raid. Arms is better for tanking dungeons.
---
I leveled 1-60 as prot, 50-60 was one of the fastest points because I was able to build groups for ST/BRD/Strat/Scholo near instantly.   
---
Imo go ST from 48-55, 55-58 do BRD (As much as you feel like, it's a big instance have an idea what type of run you want to do), then from 58-60 do live and dead strat /scholo. I wouldn't aim for DM until you're 60, east is a maybe but west and north are a bit too rough to try to tank through initially.
---
I will make it a point to dungeon with some sub 60s tonight.
---
This week. Next week they will be.
---
Yeah I've tinkered around with the channels and tried most combinations of joining leaving re ordering and just can't find a fix. The reason I would log in flight is because I would check my bank alt auctions.
---
It's not laggy. Things have calmed down considerably in the FOUR DAYS phase 2 has been out. You're a massive, gaping vagina.
---
Fucking casual, git gud. I mean all you have to do is play 30+ hours a week to have a chance. Fucking loser. What do you have a life or something? I bet you don't even live with your mommy.
---
We currently have severe diminishing returns in place, keep that in mind. If you solo the same person multiple times in the same day you will actually get 199 + 150 + 100 + 50 honor total, and zero for every kill after that.
---
gotta play smarter. level in dungeons or failing that find an out of the way spot to grind mobs, it's a big world. questing is only better xp if you can do it efficiently.
---
If you're good at sham and the tank doesn't wiggle too much, Fire Nova Totem can nuke infinite targets. Just takes some careful placement of the totem, as it can draw aggro and die prematurely.
---
I killed a 47 because I was mad at him for not being 48 after I let him be for over an hour (circling by on a mining route) and he went AFK instead of grinding mobs.
---
Thank you.  Great write up.
---
Do you have a link for the PVP set? [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=345/champions-threads#comments) doesnt show any spell crit on the set.
---
had what i'm presuming is a weird bug happen earlier during a maraudon princess kill. i was dropping combat mode between auto-shots despite her engaging me the entire time, almost like a PvP fight. anyone ever seen anything like this before? not sure how it came about. (note the combat icon in the middle of my player unitframe and the ability to drink in 'combat')
---
Just remember, queue times for BGs are going to be a lot better if you're playing as alliance on a horde dominated server.
---
play smarter noy harder. level in dungeons or failing that find an out of the way spot to grind mobs, it's a big world. questing is only better xp if you can do it efficiently.
---
What do you want to know?
---
I regularly meet people that play retail as well as classic. It's casually brought up in dungeon groups all the time.
---
i just stand there and golfclap, i usually don't get ganked twice.

Tip: Killing guards gives no honor

/golfclap
---
Is there a way for me to be power levelled like in Diablo where anyone can just stand in the entrance or behind the tank/dps while gaining huge xp? How feasible is it when it comes to xp gain?
---
It's the combined damage on a target from your entire party/raid.  The percentage of damage you do to a target directly reflects the honor received.
---
i dont think you understand what pvp is
---
Because attackers won't know you're there...
---
what if its your main cause ;,,,(((((((((((((
---
Seems odd. I played various parts of retail throughout WoW's history, even up until Classic. Now you can't say you haven't met a player who has played retail WoW in the past 10 years.
---
I remember doing this back in Vanilla when the demons respawn timer was about 8 hours, shared between factions and generally impossible to do unless you woke up at 2-4am when nobody was online so you could get an uninterrupted opportunity.
---
Which is how I ended up doing it. :|
---
I agree, however, it teaches you the fundamentals of being a real Hunter.
---
...and to this day I play my Hunter in retail, and she carries the Rok.
---
Mhm yessum! it's real, challenging anyone who doubts they authenticity to try it for yourself or check for my character name on Bloodsail BuccaneersUS :3 I stand by my craft.
---
&gt; Although Horde has a couple of notably strong individual racials Alliance honestly just have the better overall stack.
---
&gt; Perception
---
&gt; Diplomacy
---
Look what I could do. Because you did.
---
It's war.
---
yea true, but I am not sure how much longer I can play on the lower population faction..
---
Yes we get it OP, you play horde and don’t face the issue. Just like every single fucking one of these ‘pVp HaPpENed On A pVP SeRvER’ threads.
---
Way ahead of ya bud, I deleted that shit right off. I am all for pvp, but playing alliance is actually impossible. So I'm not gonna waste my fuckin time being  miserable every night.
---
Horde have very very good PVP racials compared to Alliance, pretty much the only reason.
---
Not just that but this fuckers have been clearing all content and leveling alts higher than my main. I mean Ive done it before, so maybe that's why it's obvious to me now, but these dudes have taken a fun game and have prioritized it above all else in their lives. Then they call those of us that don't casuals, I mean by that metric... Yeah I am a casual, y'all have crossed into the realm of an unhealthy addiction. Ya need to get a grip.
---
but no where in the game did it say "picking alliance means you will be unable to use boats, flight paths or turn in quests in any 45+ zone", because that's how it is during prime time (hell even off hours)
---
Keep sayin this... but.. don't ban anything. Put it default in the client. And yes, cast bars are on the same level, for sure.
---
Their*
---
Like four times. Come on OP.
---
Im a mage with counterspell silence. I wait for the enemy to nearly kill their mob.
---
If its caster I run in, silence them with counterspell and for 4s they can’t do anything during that time I frost nova them in place and sheep their target where it gets back all of his HP in no time. If it’s a melee, its as simple with just a frost nova.
---
Cant remember if its in classic but /golfclap is way better.
---
 "You clap for &lt;target&gt;, cleary unimpressed."
---
Assuming they can read that emote.
---
Just keep running to your destination while being attacked, cuts a few steps off the the back at least. even 1v1 the chances of you beating someone if they get their opener is so low, if you're playing a melee anyway.
---
It's just courteous. Not required I was don't think, but people try to be nice and not presume who would or would not mind their name being blurred.
---
because finding tanks is hard?
---
Damn this is cool, so thought out. I will take some ideas from you for sure. Thanks
---
You think you’d still have fun with alliance. And you’d be wrong.
---
This is the song of my generation...
---
Going to play the devil's advocate: it's not about skill or dps. It's about knowing how to path to not butt-pull while skipping packs and having aggro range as small as possible(lower level players pull from further away). People used to get mad at me for refusing lvl's 57 to arena/anger/golem runs but the point is not that "you can even complete it as a 53", it's that if you want to speedrun 4-man 13-minute runs using the window skip([example](https://youtu.be/Pe00cxuqoXI?t=60)), you can't have a lvl 57 pulling packs left and right. To get the rarest items like the gladiator chest or even HoJ, you have to optimize as much as possible otherwise you will spend your entire life rolling the dice.
---
Then don't read them you imbecil.
---
I think they should wait a little longer before making any decisions. It's been less than a week since honor was added.
---
came here to say that. its slightly more horde than alliance but not by much. around 55-45 or so.
---
I mean you're not gonna get in a game with a premade every time. BGs are crossrealm, so as soon as you notice the opposing team is all from one server you simply quit the BG and try again in 15 min.
---
play smarter not harder. level in dungeons or failing that find an out of the way spot to grind mobs, it's a big world. questing is only better xp if you can do it efficiently.
---
Kinda agree when almost every single trending "hot" video on the reddit is just a mage steamrolling over the other pleb classes.
---
You aren't talking to many people then.
---
And I told you I didn't see you pull before I left group. I still have the entire chat log. 
---
I think you are overreaching calling this insane slander and threatening to blacklist me in the first place. I came here asking if I was in the wrong and most people don't seem to think I was.
---
You commented twice
---
You are such a loser bro
---
Like your terrible at life
---
This is literally only an issue on the full servers, every where else no one gives a damn about your level/class
---
I think people just want to stay as high as they can within the brackets. If you aren't in the top percentage you won't get rank 3/4 after the reset.
---
The ones you described are the mods
---
pretty much
---
Found one.
---
1. be stupid enough to think those groups are the same people.

Its almost like there are different people with different opinions.

You have never once won a 1v3 to players within 8 levels of you and you know it.
---
Like dude, everyone knows you are just being a liehard.
---
Stuff like this is why I'd rather be a slight underdog faction-wise than be on the vast majority, even if it means I end up dying here and there. First day of honor system, I as a 43 hunter get ganked by a 47 pally. A bit later, he ganks me again. Oh well, that's life. On the bright side I learn from these fights  that pally has a stun and an incapacitate. 
---
=
---
Later on, I see him off in the distance with ~50% hp 50% mp killing a mob. Obviously I send my pet in, and a few arrows later he's dead.
---
I see a fishing spot was nearby, a floating wreckage, about 50 yards out. I put down my insurance™ freezing trap behind me, stealth my cat, and cast my reel. Catch a few things. Refresh the trap again. About 1.5 minutes later in total I see a guy on a horse riding in full blast straight at me. It's him. I keep fishing. He comes up directly from behind and... pow. He's frozen. I /laugh. Funniest bait I've done.
---
The fight lasts like 30 seconds between stuns and divine shield and healing back up with holy spells etc (I guess he didn't have divine shield up for the first fight), but due to the trap allowing me to start the fight from full distance and optimal conditions, I still win it "easily". 
---
I do agree that these little rivalry moments and small scale skirmishes are golden and are what truly make the PVP world experience.
---
DM wasn't released early. It came out a month before PvP debuted in vanilla, and BG's came out 6 weeks after PvP in vanilla.
---
There's 0 chance BG's come out the exact same time as BWL.
---
What an original post...
---
If you see a Hunter of the opposite faction doing this quest, your only course of action is to immediately attack the demon (so that it despawns) and then gank the Hunter (since he's low on health and doesn't have his pet out). 
---
You got what you deserved for trying to help him IMO.
---
There's diminishing xp returns when grouping with people much higher level than you, and also for killing mobs that are too high level. You can be powerleveled by not being grouped, having the low-level player tag a mob, and having the high-level player finish the mob off, and doing that over and over. Because they can't be grouped for this to work and because you have to fight relatively-close-level mobs to gain decent xp, it has to be done out in the world in somewhat-level-appropriate areas, you can't just sit in a level 60 dungeon with your level 10 character while your level 60 friends do all the work.
---
I don't know if any of you played Planetside 1. But they had 3 factions and used a faction-based queue. It worked wonderfully.
---
6 hours if you want the buff, anytime just for the loot.

We have 4 manned all 5 man dungeons. Granted, we are good buds who have been playing wow together since 2005 so coordination and communication is readily available but come on... these things aren’t that hard. Hell, rag was killed by 58’s.

What server
---
Not that I know of
---
What exactly happened here?
---
This is an update to the original story.
---
99% of people I've interacted with have played retail a bunch.
---
It will matter when battlegrounds come out and Horde are forced into fights with equal numbers.
---
lmao I was like wow really are warriors this simple?
---
Someone was mad and downvoted me.
---
My guild is on a grossly Horde-favoured server (over 60:40), and we solved this by joining up with another guild and moving into BRM with them. A third guild who wasn't raiding at the time also had their PVP group in there, so there were about 100 of us and only 40 Horde.
---
Found the horde player guys
---
dude, in 4-6 weeks I can have a brand new 60 on a server where I'm not getting camped.
---
I get camped by 10+ alliance daily when I'm farming herbs for my epic mount.   
---
I just know its part of the game, and choose not to cry about it.  
---
Was Alliance in vanilla, got camped my horde then as well. again on a smaller scale but the raid groups were still present and camping,  
---
It happens on both sides.
---
Its pre-raid BIS for a setup no one plays.
---
You love me
---
whats funny is Asmongold complaining about getting ganked a few days after he ran around with 100 of his viewers ganking low level Horde for 4 hours straight.
---
Nope.  I play alliance on Windseeker.
---
They should start a support group.
---
Hey if you mercilessly kill low levels it makes it take longer before theyre 60 and camping flight masters
---
More than a few
---
well you gotta wait the 2 min potion cd , so thats 1 min 30 sec with no fap after the first one
---
Lol bigglesworth horde are so trash, can only win when in a group of 15+ other hordies then rage when alliance players out smart them
---
What game are you playing? Im 51 (worse level to be) and having fun at my peace, sure I get killed a lot but chill, this is part of the jouney
---
No, they could take the free transfers off so that others could play as well. Running to your corpse 30 times then logging off isn't playing the game.
---
He did ask about raiding though also and hemo is way, way below even cb/prep dagger, takes up a valuable debuff slot and even in melee heavy raids the debuff doesn't make up for the loss of damage compared to combat.  If you raid as hemo you'll probably be asked to respec unless your raid is extremely casual to the point of possibly not clearing MC.
---
Well you're kinda the problem of WPvP, you simply enjoying slaughtering people in free battles where you have no chance of losing. You gain nothing out of it but some satisfaction of killing helpless players.
---
Lol what? I have interacted with other players
---
Yeah that’s not how it works. Also lag was a problem in wpvp long before spy. You should delete your question.
---
Tolkien I believe also called his wife, Luthien.
---
Why weren't people PvPing before?
---
name checks out
---
But that is part of the game.
---
Its up to the Alliance to work together and take back the stronghold.
---
Dueling is a huge part of PvP. You're crazy if you think that duels aren't an incredibly important part of PvP.
---
And what do you think will change? These minmaxers have already grinded out their BiS, honor is their only path to progression. Their ranking is based on the top honor farmers. With the birth of streamer culture and social media it means the top wont let up, so there's no reason to assume everyone else will either.
---
Literally unplayable /s
---
Currently playing a hunter. 
---
The thing I love the most is the Eagle Eye macro which allows you to chain cast eagle eye literally across the entire continent as long as you have mana. The downside is that once you eagle eye outside of your current zone, your game will stop rendering units, although this may have changed with the no-layering update.  But it's cool because when combined with a "/target XYZ" macro, I can scout through entire zones for specific players or rare mobs. Or, I can look around and see if XYZ farming zone is already being farmed. Or where the minerals are. Or if (with track humanoids on) there are any humanoids in a certain area (maybe enemy players).
---
 Or, probably the most funny use I've had yet, spectating a ridiculous (apparently) 50v50 fight, in STV by the gurubashi arena, all the way from the Booty Bay docks.
---
.
---
I also like being able to put my cat on prowl, put a freezing trap behind my back, and pretend I am afk/not paying attention. It's caught 2 players so far, and it was a great laugh each time.
---
Because they are a bunch of zoomer gamers. A large majority of these players never played any canilla/tbc/wrath or pservers where world pvp was a huge part of the game. Anyone tjats been around the scene/game for long enough knew exactly what was going to happen this week. And it did. Yet you dont see any of tue veterans complaining do we? No. Because we know exactly what was coming.   
---
   
---
Anyone bitching about pvp on a pvp server needs to be camped into quitting the game. You are the reason retail is the way it is. Stop complaining or roll pve. Its literally that simple. No one cares about how much you invested into a character. You KNEW the rule set when you rolled. STFU and play the game.
---
a stack of light feathers and some invis potions are probably worth more than the pattern by now
---
Even the "low population" realms are like 4-5 times the size of realms in vanilla. I feel that they're even bigger than high pop late TBC / Wrath servers were. 
---
I remember it being extremely rare to see people in zones at like 4 am doing stuff, if you stayed up that late on a weekday. But in classic you still have 30 people in eastern plaguelands at that time.
---
I'm just glassin
---
Unpopular opinion: Freezing band sucks for all types of game play and for all classes.
---
So people weren't pvping phase 1 on a pvp server? What websites are you looking at? Lmao
---
Die
---
Yet to see the sinew drop going on two months... everything else is done
---
I'm tired of all the bitching about bitching posts yet here we are
---
Except this is NOT #nochange because they've already implemented a few big changes. First being population size. Second is this is built on BFA engine or w.e. I'm sure there's other changes but those are two main notable ones.
---
Calling it AOE isn't exactly fitting... Whirlwind hits 4 targets and the other two hits 2...
---
Actively form swapping was my favorite part about playing a druid back in WOTLK. It's probably not the same exact thing, obviously, but it is definitely cool to be able to switch between different modes to use your vastly different abilities (stealth from cat, stun and tankiness from bear, self heal from caster, speed with travel/aquatic) to great effect. 
---
I imagine the satisfaction at least is similar.
---
Yeah see the last part of my comment. The people who go above and beyond to defend this hack are the ones who would be lost without it.
---
I've never experienced that. At 60 a mage / warlock group leader would be happy taking you since a hunter doesn't roll on their items and they can just invite another melee DPS to be clear of people rolling on their stuff. At low level groups should be happy to have a hunter since I think they give the best overall DPS below level 50.
---
lol well, at least he listened
---
I'm LVL 51 on my main. You don't need to tell me, I'm just trying to avoid them for next few weeks till it dies down. Or I'll probably just cancel and come back later when it's better. Every area 50+ is a farming ground for 60s as we give honour. Not only that, but they hit you in groups of 5.
---
3 stances though
---
100% of the time when someone threatens you with a "blacklist", it's bullshit. Nobody is petty enough to actually make any kind of public blacklist for anything other than straight-up ninja looters.
---
See you still aren’t getting it. Some servers are so imbalanced it is literally impossible to get enough alliance to win the fight as there are close to double the amount of horde. As soon as you start winning they just back off, summon more people and have the numbers again.
---
The bottom frame should read /golfclap
---
Dosnt bother me lol... Its just pay back from me camping ppl..
---
57 undead mage. loving wpvp. cant wait to hit 60 in a few months!
---
im pretty sure you dont heal if you are ready To lose your shit over the lack of 25 healing on an overgeared priest for farm. You can make the appropriate conclusions about the value of your input by yourself.
---
Is it possible for a boss to both crit and crush on the same attack? I was reading about hit tables and it makes it sound like it can only be one or the other but I have seen people talking about crushing blows criting.
---
You want a 3.5 because flurry makes it close to 3.0. Its been theory crafted into oblivion dude. Come check put the shaman discord and speak your opinion. Im sure you will get better answers from us shamans than random lvl 34 plebs on here.
---
It dismisses your totems. Pretty self explanatory.  I can't explain the actual syntax of the command, as I dont have access to any documentation that details in game functions and interactions with the functions via commands.
---
“Donut this!”
---
Horde racials are overpowered, people are minmaxing like crazy in classic.
---
Dozens of us
---
ok I'm calm.
---
Fuck out of here. The first half of the conversation was about the loot rules. You didn't even reply with the "You pulled you shitter" until after I reiterated why I left group 3 teams. It seems like a convenient excuse for you threatening me with a blacklist now that this post has a little traction.
---
Feel free to blacklist me, I have no desire to play with people who throw around meaningless threats and cry about slander the moment they called out on it.
---
Glad we agree.
---
there's no such thing as unjustly killing a rogue
---
This "dead server" mentality is so flawed and the reason players stayed on overpopulated realms.
---
Yeah, after reading your post, I doubt that. Either you've never interacted with another player, or you're flat out lying, just to pander to the anti-retail babies.
---
Lol you dumb shit, we're talking about the theramore boat.  The boot bay boat is ironically safe because all the horde are targetting high griefing centers.
---
Ahh that makes sense I didn't consider the flurry effecting it.
---
Just leveling guns, don't see the issue.
---
Wait what? How in the hell did you manage to hit respawn times in ubrs on the way to rend?
---
It's a rogue so you're all good.
---
These are all legit concerns and you're basically saying suck it up game is fine when there are obvious flaws lmao
---
zug zug me orc me smash
---
wut
---
more work
---
me not that kind of orc
---
You can't even quest at that level anyways, hope you like dungeons for those last two levels.
---
Blizz by far hasn't done anything effective to maintain the balance of factions, and I don't see they have interest to do so. If this keeps going on, a lot realms will be one side domination.
---
Sounds like exactly what I’m after! I’d love to take a look
---
Shit looks like a need a new macro.
---
lies, no one plays on windseeker
---
/sigh
---
/yawn
---
Yeah even as prot I pull the packs, LoS, pop Berserker Rage and immediately Whirlwind.
---
To finish them you only need a Hunter, a Holy Nova, a Consecration or a Warlock. Mage does it alone. But about every comp can do it.
---
Thanks! Any example builds you can recommend I look at?
---
I'm in the same boat my man. I'd be 60 too if I didn't have to work and go to school full time. Every time I see someone like OP I just think if the, ["Sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server" starter pack.](https://i.imgur.com/RvoL8yV.png) lol
---
Combat log could have its radius reduced, or it could only show opposing faction activity if they are themselves targeting/acting on a player.
---
Sometimes the head doesn't appear to be up and it still doesn't give the buff because it's bugged. Guilds that raid on that day will probably know the next time the buff can be applied, unless somebody comes and messes it up in the early morning. So yeah, don't be that guy and if you actually need the buff, ask on server discord or something.
---
The warrior and paladin bit got me Hahahah
---
Let me just get this out of the way. Your $15 doesn't give you ownership of the character. You don't even own your account. Blizz has the right to disable it at will with no explanation. You're simply paying for a temporary license to access their game.
---
Paid transfers will come later in the lifecycle, just like it did in vanilla. Paid transfers weren't there from the getgo.
---
I mean I'm absolutely fine if alliance players quit from being on unbalanced servers.
---
I'd like blizzard to come up with a solution, but I don't want that solution to be just telling me I'm not allowed to play wow with my friends any more.
---
The fight is super easy if you click on the pike every 15 seconds or so. Even welfare gear 58s can do it without a problem.
---
The comment above yours is why a lot of healers tend to suck ass. No reason to have more than 3-4 shamans in early content.. priests do better jobs until shamans get t2 and better +healing. Its wasted space having more than 4. If you have more than 2 melee groups or are using a druid as MT, theres no need for a shaman in tank group, meaning you need one less shaman to being another priest or rogue/fury. Watching healing mana is nice... but healers tend to trade top spot on meeters when using the 5 second rule efficiently. Having all healers at zero mana is shit. Having all healers at 100% mana is shit. Tank healers should be rotating regen. Can be a shaman/druid/priest it doesnt matter as long as regen is being rotated.        
---
There just to much to healing to teach some one how to heal.. you either get it or you dont... i cant sit there and tell you to spam r3 flash heal since if i do.. thats all youre gojng to do and not know when big heals are needed... 
---
Healing is a feeling and can not be taught. Anyone who says it can be, is not a healer or is very shit at the game and wants to be included in a topic.
---
You can tank fury up to MC
---
Wow that's a dick move, it's one thing if he chooses the 60 priest over you. Some people don't know how to handle these social situations
---
Overpopulated servers with mass ganking is not fun for the underdogs. Real pvp is a blast, these servers are too populated to do anything in the world without dying to a death squad. If you think that is fun and what a pvp server should be like then you really must suck at pvp.
---
Thanks boot licker.
---
Oh lol I see
---
Spell crit is your bread and butter.
---
But orc racial is only 15% stun resist in this patch?
---
It is not accurate at all since renew spec priests do triple the healing a druid does.
---
I lol'd pretty hard out loud, at work, reading this. well done.
---
These massive server populations were never in classic either...
---
Then get off Reddit and play the game
---
This already happens with queues. No one is actually preventing you from playing. Presumably there will be faction/server changes. or you can reroll - this is the exact same predicament alliance is in (for the majority of pvp servers). If alliance could faction change or transfer, the pop imbalances would become even larger, which hurts everyone.
---
The problem is theres a faction imbalance, and it needs to be addressed. do you have any other suggestions?
---
I once made a group of three hunters with my priest friend, because she wanted cloth and I wanted plate. Dungeon went fine, it felt like we had 8 people it was ridiculous.
---
When can I tank BRD (including princess) well? I’m lv 55 prot warrior with a couple pieces of BiS gear
---
Trav's Backpack shouldn't be passed to the tank anyway. That doesn't really count as a "green". It's not loot; it's what you use to hold your loot. Everyone should have the right to rolling on a backpack.
---
can go with ctrl &amp; alt+crtl also, 5 actions per button,
---
That's more or less my experience, but I would add a new category
---
D: People very, very bad at PvP. Casting polymorph on a druid bad
---
And it also leads to C
---
Well that's different, you all know each other. I'm talking about pugs where people are much more likely to make mistakes, and the difference between wiping and not can come down to a couple of levels.
---
You rolled the care bear faction for a reason, and now you want to pretend you're a pvper? lol.
---
You are going to do yourself a favor respeccing to arms asap. Tactical mastery is soo good for dungeons, and rest of the tree makes questing significantly better. Fury is really good lategame because the talents scale better. At 19 though its not that big of a deal yet. You could tank deadmines just fine without a single talent point spent.
---
Nice!! We got rang down to 4k health but only had 3 healers with no mana left, then he despawned lol
---
&gt;lvl 60 best for PvP - SL/Nightfall OR 5/31/15
---
looking at pure PVP spec and i cant decide on Nightfall or shadowburn...
---
i recommend this spec for pvp: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0eboxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R (16/12/23) 
---
gives up cold blood and gets improved sprint instead for more mobility. for the reason you said cold blood isn't as good with daggers as it is with hemo, and also because hemo rogues lack burst damage without it whereas dagger rogues already have a lot of burst potential in backstab and ambush.
---
that said both specs are good. and cold blood isn't useless for daggers. you don't always need a 5 point cold blood eviscerate, if a 2-4 point is enough to finish someone off that's all you need. also it can be used with backstab or ambush for a guaranteed crit.
---
What? Is threat actually going to be at all an issue post-thunderfury?
---
Especially when you can dw tank with thinderfury, which people will probably do up until some fights in naxx.
---
Imagine being a Pserver baby trying to flex on lv 54's just trying to level.
---
Jokes on the gankers I die to pve all the time too
---
If the server populations were as they were in vanilla (#nochanges ) then yes it would have been fine. The problem was layering allowed them to stack the servers full of people and barely anyone quit like they anticipated and now it’s a shitshow.
---
The terms were agreed to and you left out important details before running to reddit to QQ. If you innocently wanted to find out if you were being fair you would have blanked out names and not mentioned guilds. GG’s
---
You're welcome microbrain.
---
It's not hard to find groups for those dungeons at all. It's a fallacy, at peak hours just /who dungeon name. There's tons of people in there, there are tons of guild/friends groups running those.
---
Gnome mage lvl 49 in Blaumeux. Usually if I encouter horde i'm 1v3. But it felt really good today to destroy a 53 mage before he and is lvl50 hunter buddy finished to kill me for the third time. So it feels a bit inbalance but I still have fun.
---
Wont get banned. Please stop making these posts. It will broke all other addons that rely on the combat log if this is banned. Say goodbye to omnicc, dbm, recount/details and a host of other addons if this is what you want.
---
You mean you have 7 druids in guild, and 5 of them are healing in your runs? The other two are feral, or benched? Not sure what this statement means. Regardless, yeah it's a lot more than normal. In pugs or young guilds you'd usually struggle to find one druid just to buff mark and scoop up the set pieces, as you get more players you'll usually get a few more druids, but 5 is way overkill. 2-3 is the most a "tryhard" guild would have eventually.
---
That said, you'd be more than fine in the current content. You might ask the druids if they really want to compete with 4 others for tier pieces when they'd have much less competition elsewhere, but if that's their choice then whatever.
---
backstab
---
That’s fair, I handled it poorly.

Fat

PvP has never been about world pvp in classic wow.  Yall got duped by the edgelords who now have more players to fuck with.
---
On whitemane there were enough horde to put 5 full raids on kazzak at 4am server time.
---
60 rogue can solo it for the group if they are willing to wait for two vanish cooldowns
---
I remember it being 7 hours initially. Some asshole runs by and shoots your demon, now you have to wait 7 hours to try again
---
#NoChanges. This isn't your own private server where you get to make the rules for the museum. It's a 15 year old rerelease. Assuming you also knew what pvp meant before you started your character. Don't fight people near the teleporter.
---
I wouldn't even say asshole. Being the asshole would have been to stick around and fight till they got their way, or were kicked. Seems they figured the argument wasn't worth it and quietly were on their way. The asshole is the person who couldn't let it go and had to chase them down in whispers. But, we only know the story from this cap soooo \*shrug\*
---
When this happens to me I just ress at Graveyard, Hearth, and log out. I'm not going to complain about the PvP Servers because I enjoy the genuine group vs group wPvP, but yeah, save yourself the time and just take ress sickness and hearth back to IF, log out and do something else.
---
I wasn't duped by anyone. As I said, I'm on a PvE server. 
---
Think what you want. I recall those days quite clearly, and how much fun they were. 
---
But I never said it was all about world pvp.
---
I can't wait for AB and AV, WG can fall in a pit and burn forever for all i care.
---
It’s not only but by it mostly is.
---
It is fucking ridiculous the game is unplayable as Alliance.
---
Thunderclap and thorium nades?
---
I hear your point, but modern WoW is all about mounts and gear takes a back seat. The loyalists stuck around for mounts, but many people stopped playing due to that design philosophy.
---
In my humble opinion: Gear is more important than mounts always.
---
Yeah, makes sense when you put it that way.   most people don’t want an engaging dungeon experience...
---
Lmao im a mage and it's the complete opposite ... Wtf are you talking about
---
Just like real life fapping
---
Yeah but I lose 45 healing. How do we figure that out?
---
You're good. I leveled 2H fury til 40 then respecced to arms for Mortal Strike.
---
| It was exhilarating seeing him killing mobs a distance over and trying  to figure out the best way to get a charge jn without him seeing me   
---
I remember hiding behind trees and terrain trying to sneak up on people to get my charge in, then my buddy showed me the spy addon.
---
No wonder my sneaky tactics kept failing lol
---
My name is in there too. People can blacklist me if they think I'm being a dick. I invite you to do the same.
---
Take it up with blizzard who thought 90% of the players would quit.
---
Exactly. There's so many ways to combat this behavior. That's what's so great about this game. With a little forethought, planning, and coordination, it's easy to pvp on a pvp server!
---
I had an idea for a guild of lvl 47s called Honorless, 47 Ronin or some other stupid ass name. Then run around twinked out killing 60s. Using sappers and shit, to kill people for honor who couldn't get any back. Lol 
---
I couldn't get enough people on board :(
---
That's the kind of thing relevant for solo pvp or maybe some small group pvp (assuming the enemy team doesn't have anyone who can just disspell the sheep). I don't think I've seen any encounters with less than 10 players since the honor patch, though.
---
I wouldn't call it great for pvp. It can do surprising burst damage up close, but it's easily kited and everyone knows to keep their distance from a shaman with a two hander. In mass PVP it's completely useless as you'll die 10 times over before you reach anyone. Elemental on the other hand is one of the better PVP specs with amazing burst, given the right gear.
---
It wasn't the elementals. He was in the southeast
---
Probably jerking off and crying about their queue times since I play on a PvE server.
---
LFG/City chat is not a good indicator of the community. Plenty of people take lowbies to dungeon runs, it may appear otherwise because a bunch of people are spamming those requirements have a harder time filling those requirements.  
---
It's kinda like people who thinks the worth of an item is what is listed on the AH, aside from the complexities of people trying to manipulate prices chances are if you are seeing those consistently high prices it's because no one is willing to buy at those prices.
---
paranoia wasn't shit in vanilla....
---
Very cool, one of the few I haven't seen. 
---
Good job mate. Any other areas you looking at getting into?
---
Raiding as alliance is flat out easier because of pally blessings. I rolled horde for a challenge. Same thing with BG's. Paladins are very, very strong.
---
I also wanted to know what windfury felt like. Ohhh, soooo good. :)
---
They aren't sure, but many realms are very clearly Horde heavy, and there was some data from months ago when census was working that showed most pvp realms as heavy horde.
---
No, it's not. It's PVP servers prior to honor, which is the worst thing to happen to the game in vanilla
---
80/20 server and they still cheat. The microcosm of every full/high pop server in a nutshell give or take a little on the population split. Yikes
---
Dude as a mage class leader I kill for all of my guys to come in cookie cutter specs and to use best in slot lists.
---
Disposed of!
---
Idk man I didn’t no life the first few weeks so I could group with 50’s 3 months in
---
Omg thank you for that link, it perfectly captures a bunch of the facets these fuckers keep sweeping under the rug by saying that.
---
Fair enough, I've yet to have a bad one in classic. It's mostly mages/fury wars that are on my shit list
---
Coming from the guy who can’t possibly image a world where a warrior gets off a charge on a warlock. Incredible.
---
Even right now a well geared Ele can global a pally with batched EM. It only takes 1.5 sec which means if the pally just used a spell that isn't bubble, he triggered his gcd, thus can't use bubble and dies.
---
I do heal actually, and it’s not about the 25 healing. It’s about your given an item, the 2nd one. And you use it for farming..
---
Eh anger and arena runs you don't have to be that high, i agree with this guys path though
---
I transferred from whitemane to earthfury as alliance and I am enjoying it here. I can still quest without dying 10 times a question but I still have frequent wpvp encounters.
---
&gt;The thing people forget is that slice and dice gains more benefit the slower a weapon is. So whatever theoretical dps is lost from not having a faster swing is gained both from the faster swinging heavy hitter plus the bonus sword procs it generates.
---
this is just wrong. slice and dice is a percent increase. it makes no difference if the weapon is faster or slower when it comes to it's white damage. faster offhand sword is better because you will get more sword procs and poison procs with a 1.8 speed sword in your offhand than you will with a 2.8 speed one.
---
You're a genius.
---
Almost looks like he was looking for an excuse to leave.
---
Even still, people whine on reddit as if redditors could do something about it. It's like calling the police because your toilet is clogged...wait I'm sure idiots do that too.
---
Except raiding as alliance is easy mode... I watched early scuffed alliance attempts on bosses that would have been a wipe for a horde guild that was recovered. Pally blessings, auras, and heals are so powerful.
---
My gear matters a lot.
---
I’m an Orc DPS warrior (who often shieldwall macro tanks Onyxia phase three and offtanks Domo etc) and I got a Spinal Reaper on the weekend. The increase in my ability to pvp is insane. As arms during the week (fury for raid) with the SR I can 2 hit a clothy if I get lucky whereas before it was a struggling to finish mages/locks/spriest before dying even with recklessness in some cases.
---
Also having access to some of the coolest looking weapons in the game - f yeah.
---
Not sure if it’s coincidence, but since last night I’ve seen at least 4 bots. The most advanced one made them say something in chat and start dancing, and then HSing once I started stealing their mobs. Another (the one in the clip) buffed me but didn’t reply when I asked if he was a bot
---
Plus, if you're "nice enough" to bring them when everyone else is ONLY bringing 60s, they'll probably love you forever. :)
---
Naw, Bears are really good tanks through and through.
---
Their main issue is that there's some fights that they just can't do, so even though they handle lots of things better than warriors do, that handful of situations where warrior is the only option just bites druid's reputation in the ass.
---
But any guild with an abundance of healers and no bear druids is doing themselves a disservice as bear druids have bizarre gear preferences that dramatically reduce gear competition with other tanks and dps compared to warriors *and* they're able to make great use of a bunch of otherwise bad pieces that'd just get sharded.
---
As a 56 mage. plz inv.
---
Benediction. Need more allies to keep the balance since new horde players have recently discovered its balanced and have been rolling here.
---
Server is less “mature” than many others with more lower level players than most and without as much inflation as others.
---
On my server warriors do a garbage bait claiming they’re gonna “pay 50g to each party member if the chest drops”. Of course they are searching for ages because running just arenas is basically a charity
---
I gained a DK and it said -100 honor on my screen. What does this mean?
---
Not even just fear ward. I'd love it if our priests lost their amazing dot that always gets dispelled in favor of an amazing instant heal.
---
lol what a wild guess
---
Because if you're on a pvp server and you're the underrepresented faction those people most likely will not be able to hit 60 anymore and will quit the game, leading to more faction imbalance.
---
Wait. I thought classic was super difficult?
---
Its every server horde has to find ways to cheese. They are trash in pvping like a man.
---
Frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt frostbolt
---
I can feel it
---
To make it even more exciting when it actually does hit!
---
BGs horde going to be whining I cant wait.
---
And people say standing in org spamming LFG is "community".
---
% energy is refunded ON MISS ONLY (ex. Leveling new weapon skill you can just spam and spam) blocks dodge and parry is spent energy
---
20 energy every 2 seconds, but its a weird rounded number so sometimes its 19, sometimes its 21.
---
Get an addon for energy tick tracking it will help you a lot
---
Yeah, those dirty hordies.  Alliance are pure and honorable, they've never stepped foot on a roof, not a single one of them ever.
---
It’s wild how many people don’t have decursive still
---
it wasnt. no local files were updated. so no patch.
---
Not really an unpopular opinion at all considering this subreddit is crying its eyes out over spy every day since PvP launch
---
Fastest clear times are done by alliance guilds. They stacks loads of warriors and others to buff them. A horde guild would have to put a shaman in every melee group, but an alliance guild just needs enough pallies to get one of each blessing.
---
Also, kings, might, and salv together are so freaking strong.
---
Yes, because being rolled over by 1-5 fully raid geared 60s as a level 50 is what I signed up for, not the threat of other real encounters with people in my level appropriate zones while progressing.
---
stop killing lv5s
---
If their level actually doesn't matter surely they should be capable of running the instances with people their own level.
---
*sad ret noises*
---
What you speculate is untrue. While alliance may do so out of reason (although not justified) of imbalance, a faction doing it when it's a 80/20 split is just cringe.
---
&gt;Thank you OP. Thank you very much for undertaking this initiative. The main reason I like it is because as someone that manages a guild, I can more easily follow the progress of my member's gear.
---
Thank you for your feedback! We work on improving the site everyday
---
I honestly don't think that it's because the horde has better racials or anything like that, in fact paladins seem to be a much better class than shaman imo. The real problem is that Alliance only has DOGSHIT races that all look like human variations. Human, a small human, and a very tiny human.... while horde has some badass variety, undead, orc, etc...
---
Sounds like a fun gaming experience
---
Mind vision sounds right.. Tracking doesnt pop a pair of eyes over yer head. Lol.. I knew they were coming cause of that.. Hope they had to fight thru my respawns while i finished up and ported out.
---
go p lay ret ail
---
It's not that straight forward. There is a penalty for using the lowest level healing spells, in regards to how much they gain from your bonus healing stat. I'm not sure what exact level this levels out to 0% penalty, but it's in the upper lvl 20s.
---
I don't know about you, but I signed up for a P.v.P (player vs. player) server; not a PS.V.P (players vs player) server. Got em!
---
*Quote from man stabbed*
---
"What are you going to do, stab me?"
---
Yeah, I played orc hunter in original vanilla. Played dwarf hunter on private servers. Back to orc hunter now.
---
I would give up hardiness in a heart beat to not have to fight pallies. It isn't even much better than stoneform, if at, anyway. I miss the reliable break of blind over relying on rng to give me unexpected stun resists
---
That's why lfr exists.
---
my first run through scholo was at 55 as a holy priest i healed through it just fine. 
---
the one that kills me in "Classic" that i did not remember is being forming groups and "reserving" items. i have dropped a few groups just as soon as they say it. this is not a guild raid, i am not being carried, and if a rare item drops we can both use. good luck to you but i hope i win the roll.
---
Some kind soul invited me to an UBRS run at lvl 56. I outhealed the 60 there (to be fair, druids aren't the best single target healers, but still). The run went without any wipes or hiccups (it's really not that hard). 
---
Then I try making an LBRS group after cuz I really need exp. I invite a dude from the group I just healed effortlessly, and he says
---
"you're a bit too low bud"
---
-_-
---
Poor guy honestly. Insane taking the time out to complain about getting killed on a pvp server and in one of the most avoidable ways ever that he’s experiencing.
---
I'm the other way round. Took the easy way with mage as a main as I've always mained one since I started playing WoW. Levelling a Warrior and an Enhancement Shamam atm and having a lot of fun. My mage's only job is raiding, helping my alts with gankers and buying some gear for them.
---
Why do you say that like "culture" is a bad word?
---
Because of how the addon works. They would never be able to break it without breaking every dps Meter not to mention TONS of other addons.
---
Btw the LFG addon is alive and well
---
"imagine not being able to understand a quite clear joke"
---
Hear hear to Night elf racials. I call people who don't say shadowmeld is good, unimaginative. Especially hunters. How can you not consider the ability to not be seen, to be a good ability. Wisp is also pretty great, it ensures that in group based pvp. The night elf will ALWAYS reinforce his or her team sooner than the opposing dead Horde players. Sometimes, the early arrival of a dead player means victory.
---
Stoneform and Escape artist is also pretty great. BUT i think what kills it for the Alliance, is the fact that the most popular race, Human, does not really have a solid PVP racial. Perception is mediocre, very situational. It's only useful if you know there is a Rogue in the area. Now i know for a fact the best PVPers have experiences where perception really made a difference. But to the average player, it's not as obvious as ''lol fear immune'' or ''lol nice cheap shot''.
---
Also i don't think most players realize how good escape artist is.
---
If I had been a dps in that group I'd be pissed I wasted the time of getting setup for nothing instead of doing something while waiting for a healer that's not planning on changing what puppy pplthey agreed to after it already started.
---
I don't like the terms they asked to tank the run but that's not the issue, op agreed to terms and waited for them to start to demand they modify them. It's a way worse version of entitlement.
---
Just report them, even better if you screenshot it and put in a ticket online. Skeram at its best was 80/20, it's gotta be worse now after the free xfer debacle.
---
To add to this, download the add-on "deadly boss mods" it tells you when something major is about to happen in any given fight.
---
Not sure if this one works with classic or not but the add-on "GTFO" warns you when you are standing in fire or something that damages you
---
only time I tried that I got ganked as a thank you.
---
Best hunter utility is to put a freezing trap down and have your healer stand on top of it. Any adds will rush straight at them and get insta cc'd right as they land their first hit.
---
Same here. Character creation is one of my favourite parts of any rpg. But I'm not into roleplaying and I like PvP so here we are.
---
A lot of us also simply recreated the characters we played in vanilla. I played a nelf druid back then so obviously I would play a nelf druid now as well. I chose nelf back then because I played an elf in Lineage 2.
---
Lol have fun being at the bottom of dps for the entirety of vanilla after MC isnt current anymore
---
1. Blizzard didn't open enough servers before launch
---
2. Blizzard didn't put in faction queues from the start
---
3. Blizzard didn't stop the weaker faction from transferring
---
4. Blizzard didn't put faction queues in before re-opening transfers
---
This is absolutely positively 100% completely Blizzard's fault.
---
grind gold for like 2-4 hours a week depending on how much you can make/hour.
---
Hey everyone!! I found the warrior!!

It breaks all forms of dots a Rogue could put on you. Allowing you to bandage. This fact is only lost on you if you don't have two lvl 60 hunters :)

Be saltier
---
Heart seeker isn’t accepting alliance xfers due to the lack of faction balance. Alliance out numbers horde by far
---
Anyone who really played vanilla knows all too well that wow PvP ranks are unhealthy garbage that low IQ people will attempt to achieve.
---
I remember the day I discovered you could derank in vanilla... as I had initially thought it would be like DAoC with realm ranks... 
---
My response was simple... Waste of time... I already had full raid armors...  The grind wasn't worth the time at all.
---
I think the one generalizationing here is you.
---
Your God has descended.
---
On a 55/45 server, the game literally entails the majority faction simply aoe'ing the rez locations and spirit healers of the minority faction.  It doesn't matter what faction, but this isn't sustainable. It's not playable.  I'm going to give it another week and then I'm out.
---
They need to release WSG now at least to relieve some pressure.
---
As a horde player on Skeram, I report them every time I see it happen. Same faction or otherwise
---
He's barely a streamer with all his viewbots and bannings
---
Wow this is a totally real and believable comment, I'm so sure you're not lying bro cool wow!
---
You people who threaten to “blacklist” are just cringe to begin with lmao.
---
qq
---
I have been there about 100 times, seen Gorosh 9 times, and never even seen him drop his damned chest.
---
Yes but don't use the new Ghub software, it's garbage. Stick with the older Logitech gaming software.
---
You must have reading comprehension issues. Those were the agreed terms at the start of the dungeon. Me, a fully MC BIS geared tank was only interested in gold. I was upset with OP as he waited until we pulled to leave. That’s all this was about, maybe read next time. :)
---
Let me introduce you to my friend the ban hammer.
---
it's actually 6 seconds. otherwise rogues would just gouge and stand right next to their target, restealth, reopen constantly.
---
They do now with Spy mod. Yo I just thought about it as I typed this response. Spy in BGs is going to absolutely blow.
---
i regret rolling a hunter now that i'm 60, but it was fun through most of the leveling.
---
He is referring to how the Tauren stomp ability has serious implication for the most skilled players. Making Taurens objectively better in WSG in the role of a flag carrier.
---
I think this issue sums up how little knowledge the developers had back in the day. A seemingly balanced racial at face value. Give players years of theory crafting, practice and experience. And you end up with a consensus among the top druids that Tauren is simply better.
---
Went from 95% at level 58 to 60 doing DM tribute runs (was about to level to 59 before we started. Shit was legit, 16  tribute runs over 2 days and sick pvp gear.
---
Lol I'm going to find out where you live in real life I can't take this anymore
---
Oh I'm fine.
---
You see y'all? This is the kind of person you're dealing with.
---
r/iamverybadass

The only argument against wether it should be restricted or not, is if the [event it registers](https://wow.gamepedia.com/COMBAT_LOG_EVENT) (an extended version of the combat log) passes more information compared to the events that existed in the 1.12 client, such as CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL and CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT.
---
Ok Ally
---
Kinda the opposite on OCE, everywhere i go i get ganked by alli
---
General chat is silent too
---
Literally got turned down from a brd run because I'm 31/19 enhancement resto. The group just had a caster item on reserve and I got told "sorry looking for a real healer" then Ignored. Was the funniest thing.
---
So it's just Aragorn and what's-her-name?
---
Same here. The OP's method is about reducing the number of keybinds, but I prefer using many keybindings if that allows me to not have to think about stances.
---
Why would anyone need to lie? It's not hard to get your epic mount if you prioritize that over getting gear and the like.
---
You do get honor while leveling.
---
Not as much, but its there.
---
Oh, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with the current state of affairs, I'm used to private servers with equally short sighted staff, but I lament the loss of potential in actually being able to relive the true Vanilla experience.
---
Reliving Vanilla 100% was possible, but it needed more time, effort and dedication than what Blizzard was willing to put out.
---
Get really good at 1v1. Ret is great at solo play. Honor is also gained at an incredible rate solo - one warrior on our server is nearing 80K and roams solo most of the time.
---
A mechanic in that fight that I very rarely see people know about is that anyone who loots Omokk's head can periodically right click on the pile of skulls and banner you used to summon Doomhowl (like once every ~30 seconds) and it will shoot out a lightning bolt at the nearest spawned ogre for ~70% of their max hp. 
---
And if you clear the scorpid aoe side caves before starting the fight, dropping fears to manage the adds is perfectly safe too.
---
What’s equally as shitty is that “Spy” addon you’re using. You are morally just as bad as them
---
Alliance doing this all day on Felstriker. No GM comes to stop them
---
Yeah should have gotten a better picture lol but there was a lot more :)
---
Not only did you get an incorrect respond but also he confused you with a garbage retail player asking idiotic questions regarding idiotic achievements. That’s really sad
---
When did the guards start follow them through the teleporter to gnomeragan? That's a new change then.
---
Oh yeah I know his name and avoid any group he's in. Funny thing was that I brought it up in passing to a few guildies and they all had bad experiences with the guy.
---
Thats exactly why i stopped reading it. Literally put me to sleep.
---
not in vanilla
---
I was reporting the hell out of them last night for the same issue. Glad to see Blizzard helping us out.
---
lmao there's no group size to save you except a full raid, so yeah you fly around with a full raid every time?  Doubt it.
---
it is
---
A skilled Hunter is just as good as aage for crowd control and damage. It's not that hard...
---
My class role as a warrior is as gank bait. Unless its another warrior attacking me.
---
a n a l kil l
---
hahahahahhahahahahahahahahah HORDE QOL IS RIDICULOUS HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHHAAHHAHA. Oh you are serious???
---
What is so bad about this? I dont understand.
---
What's felstriker like for horde/ally ratio? My whole family is about to quit wow because of the ganking on Aragul. It's nothing like Vanilla where we all had extensive PvP experience. The 5x population is just killing it.
---
My main is actually 41 omegalul i know. But yes I am also having a blast
---
Is it really that bad on Kromcrush? I heard it was one of the more balanced servers.
---
What's pvp to you then? Sure it literally means player vs player, but it's really mob vs. player.say what you want but you dont enjoy the 10 time corpse runs
---
I've seen SO Many people say weird things like that it shows where enemy players are and that you can see stealthed players.
---
Try getting some plate gear and you will do better.
---
I dedicate A LOT of time to WoW, I can be 60 in a week or two.
---
I would heavily advice against farming dalrends, and once you replace your mainhand mirah song is still going to be prebis, so if you get a brutality blade or viskag you want to go back to mirah, IMO enchant it
---
Alliance has Paladin.
---
Alliance has Deadmines.
---
Alliance has Menethil Harbor, arguably the best mid to late hearthstone point. We get Grom'gol but I miss Menethil Harbor.
---
It lists all console commands available and the values they are currently set at. If you want to change a value, you can do so in the menu instead of typing the command.
---
TL;DR
---
My buddy is lv 55 now, and he's starting to do BRD. It's gotten to the point where he'd be better off waiting at the instance portal as a ghost and trying to groups, instead of rez hopping 15 times from the flight point to the portal.
---
Is your opinion A usually a hunter?  Killrd this hunter four or five times and every time he never paid me any attention. Just kept shooting his mob until he died. I figured he was a bot
---
This guy is going to be so fucking mad when they roll out faction queues
---
Majority of paladins I see are in cloth, so yeah they might as well be naked.
---
I play a tank too dude. So swing and a miss. 
---
The tank can't earn that loot on his own either. He needs those other people. Ergo, he's a dick for trying to take it all, especially if he's acting like a bellend because somebody isn't happy with his attempts to take as much as possible from the group.
---
Should be noted that the offhand isn't better than mirahs song unless if you get the set bonus.

Thanks for that link. I didn’t know I had to train my beast like that. I noticed they get points. Should I be conservative with my TPs or do we get a lot of those? And are they refundable?

On my little 14 Druid in Westfall and a 60 Undead Priest (Bilbowski-Fairbanks) convinced me to attack him in emotes. He had been there a while and finally I was curious, so I moonfired him. He mind-controlled me, buffed me, then for the next four hours helped me do a bunch of quests. If I got low on health, Mc then heal me.
---
He escorted me to Darkshire to get the FP. Two horde attacked and killed me. When I rezzed, they were talking to my priest. Then apologized to me and left.
---
It was the most bizarre and fun night I’ve ever had in the game. I have not seen him since, but if anyone knows him, tell him Ella still checks the same spot for him in Westfall every day around 6 server and I &lt;in game&gt; love him.
---
How many classic servers are there listed for NA
---
people do not normally feel the need to complain when they are enjoying themselves,  what we are seeing on this sub is a vocal minority who should not have played on a pvp server.
---
That fight is about managing the bleed on the tank and CC. Ideally 2 CC classes keep the non-focus target feared/sheeped. Focus down enforcers and use the pike on them. Bleed stacks getting high, kite then until the stacks drop.
---
My friends got me into the game, not the other way around. I didnt even know the difference between servers, I just wanted to play with them. They're all extreme casuals as well so it's not like they were paying attention to faction balance when they joined.
---
Where horde has all the exploits and advantages.
---
lol, had a priest using holy nova the other night and got through it ez pzy.
---
Yeah actually had some friendly alliance mage do this to me while I was leveling my rogue at launch in burning steppes. Was expecting to get nuked, but he just broke the sheep and wandered off. 
---
Did an escort quest and 2 elite quests together with someone from other faction as well. It's fun trying to communicate with only emotes. :D
---
Very easily, actually.
---
Most of your feral talents benefit both bear form and cat form so the core of your talent tree is going to be very similar whether you're a tank or a dps.
---
Even after the core a lot of your optional talents still benefit both to some degree or another.
---
Well we didn't play without addons back then. We used a ton of addons. And some were "must haves" for raids. If you played without addons in vanilla that's on you.
---
Irony
---
They should totally change this system in future expansions!
---
And just force the transfers to servers that would balance the factions as closely as possible and add faction queues.
---
Dwarf Priest is a pretty tough matchup. 
---
Without Blind, you can't reliably full combo them.
---
&gt; Is it that you want the rankers out of the world and in BGs or you think that playing BGs against people ranking will be more fun? 
---
I tried to do a BRD run today and was on a respawn timer before I even got to the steps leading up to Black Rock Mountain. I want that to not be a thing. I know I'm on a PvP server, but up until last week was the experience I thought I would be getting. Not whatever the hell this is. 
---
Jeff from the Overwatch team has said in a few of his developer updates that in PvP, its just as important to make sure something is fun to play against along with fun to play. They are missing the fun to play against element right now.
---
No we literally cant. Transfers are faction specific. I dont have the time to do another character to 60
---
I dont see how. WF warrior can literally global you. Like you can go from 100 to dead in 1 swing, thats possible. I dont see how a paladin is suposedly better, when the possibility of ZERO reprisal is there.
---
Last add-up was 57/43 split. There are servers on bothside where its lopsided, yet nearly all complaints are from Alliance. If you look at PvE and RP servers, there are more Alliance than Horde. Maybe if alliance players get out of their heads that they will get stomped on every server the PvP would even out, or better yet just stay off PvP servers if the though of you getting demolished every time you leave a safe zone. There's no special badge for playing on a PvP server, if you don't enjoy the risk just move on.
---
it does not matter what i "think" pvp is, you as a player need to accept what the game defines as pvp if you want to play on a server with a pvp rule set.
---
I just wound up stoning to Ironforge. It's a quick flight to Menethil.
---
Good, fuck people who exploit.
---
Good for you, but most level 54s have no clue where to go and pull the entire instance. I'll take a 58 to LBRS/Strath but nothing below that and for Scholo/DM only 60s will do. I've had too many wipes because lowlevels don't know their aggro radius, it's just not worth the hassle. I'll probably make an exception for a guildie, at least I can get them on Discord and yell at them when things go wrong.
---
Nice to see a similar situation with me, although it's a shitty one
---
Damn man i hit 60 on first toon, a warrior on a pvp server after 22 days of game time :(
---
The last 1 level was terrible, i was running around in gear i got at lvl 39-42 and getting killed by everything except warriors
---
Yes I actually forgot mentioning it. One thing I consider really good is 19 twink gear for rogues hunters and warriors from DM questline. One dungeon doesn't make it up :) Horde has WC, SFK, RFK, RFD, and SM :(
---
Paladin is a meme anyway :P
---
It's advancedinterfaceoptions on twitch. Idk if spacing matters but that's how it's listed
---
That sucks for them but I don't see a problem with that, premades invested more time, more effort amd more coordination so they're doing better, just like in life.
---
I wonder if it's too late to make a warrior called 'Who' on my server
---
And its beyond me the stupidity behind it, they're literally killing their own fun.
---
I used to play classic with all my family, mother, father, brother, cousins. There's only two of us left now because of the griefing. We can all handle the occasional gank, we came from a PvP vanilla server, we get it  but every 30 seconds? It's disheartening and the opposition is just killing their own game.
---
Horde really are some of the most toxic players I have ever seen in gaming. They are deliberately trying to ruin classic. Think I'm gonna transfer to a pve server soon if blizz  doesn't fix it's shit.
---
So once people get their blue pvp gear, those who wear it will be too tanky. 
---
BWL doesn't actually give rogues much, but by AQ40 and and Naxx damage will outscale tankiness again.
---
That was before they 10x the server cap my dude.
---
Dude......
---
Fellwood is one of the worst places by far on high pop realms. 
---
It’s Stranglethorn for 50’s.
---
It's also a case of too many horde migrating to certain realms. And this could have been prevented by blizz.
---
Warlock/Mage are probably your best bets overall, with how Mage is way over populated I'd say go Warlock.
---
Rogue is probably the best for farming honor right now with solo/duo ganks... but it's kinda aids in BG's.  It's also slow going and you'll be corpse running a lot after getting a kill or two.  Those big honor solo kills are juicy though.
---
Also, in case you were thinking of it, you probably won't be getting rank 14 - not with hardcore progression on retail and the patch in Jan. So, if you play melee especially, plan to raid for weapons because pre-raid stuff probably won't cut it unless you enjoy being gimped.
---
IMO, its mainly a dueling technique. In the open world, you are just asking for a 3rd party to get involved taking that long.
---
I just had a Scholo run yesterday with a 59 rogue and mage. We did the paladin mount quest for our mate and the rogue runs right into the ghosts and immediately dies. The mage then frost novas them but doesn't move away so he gets ripped as well. We eventually kill the ghosts and ress the mage, who of course went afk. Then we try the rogue but he has released and run into the dungeon even though the gates are closed. So we wipe and have to reset the entire dungeon as well as get new summoning mats for the paladin.
---
Right, so it's the wannabe min-maxers who are left. The ones with half the skill and 10 times the ego. *So* much worse.
---
I move with w, strafe with q and e and all my abilities are within reach, a,d,s,f,g,h,1-6, ctrl alt and shift the previous keys for more abilities.
---
If there still isnt enough space (like my warlock) i have a key (Shift A and D) to cycle between a new action bar that has a different set of spells each
---
then quit!
---
Smersh bro here. That sucks :/. Hate this attitude.
---
We 4 manned Live earlier with a 58 fury war. Went fine. I really don’t understand the elitism for 5mans.
---
Haha that’s true. Just wish I didn’t end every fight against mobs at critical health, esp early on. At 60 now and starting to get geared it’s not bad. I just assume you use health potions like an ability
---
You realize that like 70% of servers are HEAVILY horde biased? Just because most players aren't posting about it doesn't mean they dont feel it. 
---
I feel like you're missing the point though. Servers shouldn't be allowed to get to this point. Faction specific queues would be an easy may to fix the problem. If would mathematically balance out the numbers and would offer a great incentive to transfer
---
How is this an unpopular opinion? My guild had a 57 mage with 3/8 arcanist. Where there is a will there is a way
---
Not gona lie that looks fuckin sick but next time hide your hub for maximum awesomeness but still very sick pic
---
imagine having no start attack macros
---
It's bigger trash than my ex
---
80% of the pop and you still need to roof camp?
---
Pretty sure people who don't understand the honor system is in a small minority, and they will realize how difficult it is when the honor resets anyway.
---
Yeah, the bot in the video buffed me when I whispered him and started jumping around a bit, but the time he took to loot and skin + the way he moved gave it away that he was a bot
---
Anathema is a fine server but the low pop makes it tough to find dungeons while leveling especially outside of prime time hrs
---
My bad. Undead mage.
---
mind vision is key, even more so than mage imo.
---
even shitty aoe can get thru the place if you know exactly where to go
---
How does this post have so many upvotes? I suppose they mostly came before the douchey edit.
---
Well we found one of the guys doing it.
---
Have fu. Being outnumbered 5-1 then. Clown
---
Alliance rep grind is easier (human)  
---
Alliance Gnomer/Deadmines  
---
Alliance Paladins
---
Alliance Priest (dwarf) has fear ward  
---
Alliance Deeprun Tram  
---
Alliance has 2 major cities that are closer and easier to get to BRD, UBRS LBRS MC BWL
---
I thought Shadowlands was a Retail Expansion
---
so ur saying i should get 13000 honor points this week and just stop PVPing til next week?
---
The only time this min/maxing should even matter is raiding. Heroics aren't that challenging and you don't get extra rewards from speed clearing.
---
Great guild name: Scotic Boom
---
I really want to try duo-tanking now with the prot pally I'm leveling.  Imagine Warr+Pally tank bros cracking heads in scholo and strat, sounds like a good afternoon.
---
You're literally playing a walking simulator
---
Think you want 
---
/targetenemyplayer
---
/cast sap
---
/cleartarget
---
I feel like Horde has PvP advantages and Alliance has PvE advantages.. humans +5 swords is huge and fear ward is amazing everywhere
---
Alliance has the no lifer mount quest though...
---
Knowing that i will lose to almost every class (nah im just no skill lol losing to mages) but having the guts to just keep playing (my sunk cost fallacy) and also, getting ez groups because my server doesnt have many tanks
---
Nope. If anything it’s libel.
---
Lol I wish I had but she was mere seconds from clapping my cheeks and I didn’t think about it till after
---
I use an add on. But it’s simple enough to just add them up
---
I thought about my last post and realized that the people who do this realize what they are doing. For a lot of them, winning is making others quit out of frustration and spite. 
---
Hopefully things get less salty and toxic over time otherwise I don't see any of the good people sticking around.
---
You get mad when some1 helps you? Wtf is wrong with your head bruh
---
I swapped to dw around 55 and had a blast. Theres plenty of hit gear that you can start getting at your level, like the ring from the last boss in maraudon, the 2% hit shoulders from BRD quest, devilsaur set bonus, etc. Plus if you use 2 axes (for orc racial bonus), you dont need quite as much hit as you would otherwise.
---
Honestly, play what is more fun to you. I did 1-55 as 2H and it just felt so slow and boring to me.
---
It's almost as if I was a first time player who chose his friends server and now am stuck on it because Alliance cant server transfer...
---
It would be ironic if that Syldra douche gets blacklisted because of this post. Whomp whomp
---
I hope it's the same, there's seemingly a static 65-45 or more horde/ally ratio. It'll be great to see all the min-max crew get destroyed by queues.
---
Hahaha yea moments like these happen in seconds
---
I dont think alliance even wanna run Gnomer themselves, i find that place cancer, specially with the wrong group.
---
Good work! I have definitely seen some of you around!
---
TLDR scared
---
No Alliance are favoured for a different reason. There's less of them population wise therefore you're competing against a smaller pool for ranking.
---
And hoj!
---
Azuresong is about 70% Alliance. The AH moves things pretty well.
---
You suck.
---
you are the one paying to play a walking simulator,
---
people that hate pvp should go back to neopets
---
I’m with you. I enjoy taking different classes and seeing what they can do. Hunters have so many qol abilities, rogues sapping or having insane DPS... it’s fun.
---
I was part of the first wave of 60s in Classic. We were doing these dungeons from the mid 50s onwards without any issues. It's so stupid to see this requirement mentality bleed over from retail. There's no need for it.
---
&gt; can’t possibly image a world where a warrior gets off a charge on a warlock
---
Again, you cannot comprehend how people discuss Class vs Class. This is 100% a you issue.
---
Menethil harbour? It’s being constantly camped and ganked by undead rogues so setting up a hearthstone there is very silly since you won’t be able to move anywhere from it with flight path always been dead. Moving from EK to Kalimdor is a nightmare for the alliance unless you are a mage/druid with a free portal.
---
You may have a point with the other things, but horde don’t have the advantage in pvp. Theres good reason why APES chose alliance, and only allow gnomes and dwarves into their guild. They know what they’re doing.
---
Lol you guys are ridiculously over victimizing yourselves, if they want mages it is for a specific build for speed clears either for leveling purposes or speed clearing purposes and having enough mages actually is pretty significant. You may get halfway through a dungeon while they are still looking but once they fill up they will do the dungeon 5 times before you've even joined your 2nd one. You literally would hold them back if they are building explicitly for mage speed farming, some pulls are sketch even with the full mage group and a hunter isn't going to be able to keep up enough on those pulls. To bring you they would potentially have to change several large pulls to be smaller which means you would be quite literally holding them back.
---
That being said speed farm groups aren't even a fraction as common post-60 as you guys are pretending they are.
---
People tried warning you all for months that this was going to happen but no one listened.
---
BGs are cross realm, so..
---
/cry
---
It's the idea that pvp is *bugged* and it isn't supposed to work like this. This is not the 'vanilla' experience, there are several problems.
---
This is awesome! small tip, if you jump before frost novaing, or nova in the air its noticeably bigger and u can snip even more with ur charge
---
Guild runs are so different. I ran Scholo probably 30 times for my damn necklace from Vectus and it was always with guildies and very smooth. Then we did a paladin mount run with me and the paladin being guildies and the rest being pugs. It was impossible. After an hour we were at the basement ready to summon the boss. The rogue pulls all the ghosts and dies, releases and runs in so he can't be ressed and can't get into the room because the gates are locked. The mage frost novas all the ghosts but doesn't move away from them, so he dies too. When we eventually kill the ghosts we try and ress the mage, who apparently has gone afk. So we wipe and have to do it all over again. Pugs are made of fail and especially with lowlevels.
---
Stop sucking
---
You're just an idiot then if your reading comprehension is fine. You don't need to join groups with reserved loot, but if you do *choose* to join those groups you abide by the loot rules, which is why what you said is pointless and irrelevant. 
---
And talking as if there's no difference between a fully geared out MC tank and a fresh 60 is hilariously wrong. People will gladly give up the random blues/greens for guaranteed clean runs and their chance at the items they need.
---
&gt; All you horde are going to be in hour long ques for battlegrounds because of all the alliance that left due to you guys griefing this hard.
---
BG's are cross-realm.
---
Bloodscalp EU even made a song about how severe it was :D
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amS4bz-yygg
---
Just outside Everlook, moment i walk towards the fp 3 cold blood spec alli rogues will 3 shot me, spit on my corpse and wait for me to rez.
---
One will wait at the gy for me to take rezz sickness and gank me again.
---
calling other people a clown when you are on reddit complaining pvp happened on a pvp server... interesting
---
That’s why it’s okay to cheat.
---
Close to 50:50
---
Also apparently bannable as it is against TOS. 
---
Something about successful *cross*\-*faction* communication is against the *TOS*   
---
Someone earlier posted that they got banned for calling the horde No Shoes
---
Lmao do not point fingers at others for your own shitty choice
---
Those are legit the best groups. Who needs a tank when you have 4 plate dps each with agro on a different target?
---
&gt;world pvp in vanilla-wotlk on my server, horde were always going for the gold shire rooftops all the time
---
It was always an offence in vanilla. In TBC and onwards it wasn't much of an issue because guards could fly with the addition of added mounts.
---
Corpse running is a walking simulator. When people who dont enjoy it choose to quit,your whole game experience will be a walking simulator to your corpse. Have fun talking shit while being on one of the 3 alliance biased servers. You're not playing real classic and you know it.
---
Queues are why I rolled my alt on another server as alliance 
---
I didn’t do a hardcore grind on my horde server,
---
just for fun to 11 (wasn’t trying, just happened by doing some pvp after raids) but the 30 minute queues do give you some time to chill or farm. You have to always be switched on and steam rolling if it’s instant queues. 
---
If going for 14 I guess you’d have to wpvp during that queue time
---
You definately are a shit cunt that would use exploits and it shows please fuck off we dont want cock suckers like you here
---
It’s almost like they’re following a pre determined vanilla schedule we’ve known about
---
&gt; humans +5 swords is huge
---
Dwarf hunters with guns, too.  I rarely miss.
---
It's not nitpicky.. it's literally opposite meanings.
---
What server are you on. Genuinely interested
---
Why waste time on wiping through a dungeon?
---
It’s such an annoying mentality. I want to compare whatever gear is just under pre-raid BiS, or whatever slightly worse alternatives. Guarantee it’s barely noticeable if that. Plus, dungeons aren’t that hard. Why play the easiest mode possible with best gear? Where’s the progress and skill building
---
This is the best answer. Buy all the lotuses you can then hold on to them until you can server transfer. You'll be a Classic millionaire in no time then
---
you should transfer off arugal to felstriker while you can bro, way less people and better balance
---
So is this like Steal your carbon?
---
I think you need to take a breath and re read what I said.
---
Nowhere did i say the tank could earn the loot on his own, exactly why I posted my example, like I said I dont know the full situation here but if any tank was to be hired like this then I assume hes 60 and fairly well decked out in a deep prot full mitigation spec geared towards carrying groups like this with a smooth run, as in a mastery carpenter vs an apprentice. 
---
The tank wasnt trying to take as much as possible from the group, the rules were set before the run, op didn't understand them and then left when he made the mistake leaving 4 other people stranded with a half done brd run, that's a dick move imo more so then charging for a service where there is an extremely high demand.
---
I main tank for my guild and have  tanked for 15 years cleared mc the second week of release. I dont need a single piece of gear from mc or any 5 man. I've built a reputation as a solid reliable player who can provide a smooth clean service to fresh 60s or lower (semi power level)  the moment I log in I get tells by people trying to pay me to do a run for them simply because there are so few tanks around. Again, why should I tank a 5 man for an hour for no reason at all for 4 pugs why cant I ask the mage to aoe farm for an hour after and give mr all the drops?
---
U made me realize i need to unfollow this pool of tears for a while, too
---
Had some great PVP there yesterday as well. At least 5-6 on both sides level 38-43 were battling it out all around Nessingwary's camp. Sadly a 60 had to show up and sort of ruin it :(
---
I try to avoid this by asking is anything reserved, and also, if we need then we need. If they dont agree, i dont accept the invite. Wouldnt really matter too, as a tank you can pick another group easily, tanks dont exist om my server
---
kek
---
Just stop playing till p3 tbh the content in p1 and p2 has been at best boring as fuck other then the lvling
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Hilarious.
---
There's no point in telling us you're leaving. Nobody here cares at all what you read.
---
Just unsub and move on. No need to post a whiny rant about anything.
---
Is your melee running out and back in?
---
I gotta agree with this. On Felstriker since day one and I havent experienced any of the negatives people are going about constantly .
---
Your reason for not choosing a pve realm is because you wanted to play with your friends. 
---
What if people wanted to join their horde friends om your server? 
---
That’s why there’s no such caps
---
Most informative posts so far, one 8.3 drops I’ll be back on the 16-hour raid schedule, and endless ap grind.
---
If it's a guildie then I'll probably take a lowlevel, but not a pug. There are tons of DPSers at 60, only the tanks and healers are scarce. The tank pretty much has to be 60 or he'll just get deleted immediately. A healer can be a few levels below as long as he knows his stuff and has some healing gear. Then again I'd rather just pay a 60 healer 15g to get me through a scholo run. Pugs are bad enough, lowlevel pugs are just complete cancer.
---
A key part of a PvP experience is it needs to be fun to play against as much as it is to play. There is a large imbalance in that philosophy right now.
---
 Cool story
---
Honor points are different than rank points. Read the post a little more closely
---
If you can do it and it won't be fixed because it's classic then it's pretty absurd to try and enforce rules around it. Just embrace it as part of the game
---
Maybe they did it to get subs?  And expected it to dwindle by the time the next expansion released?
---
Like what?
---
last I looked there wasn't. That was last week though.
---
Ahhh, I miss having CompulsiveLiar and VeryConfused
---
It's fine. They are called PvP servers for a reason. Literally every person on here complaining about PvP when they're on a PvP server is that Pikachu meme.
---
I can't wait for the weekly tally to see how many people are freaking out. Once the vast majority realize they aren't going to be famous PVP'ers after a week or two and be instantly rank 11+ they will quit and only participate in rare wPVP.
---
Showmyheal
---
Heck yeah it does! I dinged 60 in Scholo.
---
Shadowlands soundin real fuckin nice right about now classic with the retail community/pserver dudes has proven to be irritating
---
I’m a mage with enchanting/tailoring. I wish someone stopped me before I invested in enchanting. I’m sure it varies by server, but on mine enchanting is just a money sink. I have all but two recipes and it’s not made me 1/10th what it cost to get there. Eventually I may break even, but people refuse to tip and if you go to flat fees you get grossly undercut. It’s a rough and unforgiving business. Maybe I’m jaded, but personally I wish I had gone into herbalism or mining and just worked those into other gold farms. 
---
This brings me to my final point. As a mage it’s easy to hit 50g/hr, so most the time when you are trying to sell enchants you can’t get near that mark. So you just feel like you’re wasting your time. Every time you get a 1g tip for crusader you die inside a little more.

It's just people. You're delusional if you think there's any significant difference in the % of assholes in either faction. It's just you notice the horde ones more cause they're beating your face in.
---
Was this a spellcleave arena run or just a backdoor arena run? Very important distinction.
---
but its not moving the goalpost, if an addon that gave you access to fly and noclip hacks but nobody used it would not have any significance? if nobody used the addon back then it doesnt matter? because a fuck ton of people are now using said addon its breaking the game, no1 gives a shit if someone developed a similar addon back then because it wasnt common practice to use the addon so it didnt have any major impact on gameplay, are you just this fucking dense or are you trying to be funny?
---
And retail has balance?
---
Hmm I'm on alliance and agree with him. What does that mean?
---
It's just PvP servers. Alliance would seem toxic too if you played horde.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
There’s going to be a very large amount of disappointment once people realize how much of a grind ranking really is.  To get the full blue pvp set you are looking at pvping 40+ hours a week for two months.  For rank 13/14 make it 60+ hours a week and another 1.5 months on top.
---
Me and a group of 12-20 spend multiple hours a day taking flights at the same time to land at camped flight paths. Vigil- thorium point- menethil(to clear out the boat) - epl. Port to sw and go to blasted lands then repeat. They practically bring the honor to us.
---
rogue is ez honor grind
---
The moment Blizzard calls it cheating I'll agree with you. For now only a vocal minority of the community seems to think they made blizzards tos.
---
Tanking isn't that hard in wow, calm down bro.
---
May you elaborate?
---
Oh dooo they?
---
Can you do a well though out post like this except with the current problems with the world?
---
Seriously man, everything you put has been discussed 1000 times since 2004. Just let it go and enjoy the game.
---
Thanks. I just started on my spriest and got my first piece of spell dmg gear. Wasn't sure if I missed an obvious part of the UI.
---
It's already slowing down, today I actually made it to BRD with 6 corpse runs. Still roaming gank squads all over though.
---
Honestly if you are flying into thorium point it’s your own fault. I’m horde on stalagg and I still don’t fly into thorium point and ride from kargath... like it’s the most obvious deathtrap in the game
---
Honor points =/= rank points
---
Think of ranks 1-14 as level and rank points as XP.
---
The more honor points you have compared to others, the more rank points you get. If you get enough rank points you level up to the next rank.
---
Im sure my warrior isnt one of those solo pvp classes, only classes im able to consistently kill are other warriors, warlocks, and some hunters
---
I get the same tells as a healer for random shit the moment I log in. Why shouldn't I do the same?
---
Oh.

Anything less than a 10 is worthless, though.

Also did this in a group with no AoE. I hated that room so much. I want to do another emperor run so I can save the princess for the quest, and then farm her for her boots (prebis for rogues), but I'm dreading doing another run of this place.
---
I die a little inside when I see warriors only advertising themselves as dps when looking for groups. My main is a warrior and I’ll be more than happy to tank or dps, whatever the group needs. You get groups much faster and tanking is fun in itself. I would say retail mentality but in retail you can just switch to prot and do it too. So many warriors just focus mostly on dps.
---
Spy will tell whether stealthed rogues are nearby in AV when any of the zone-wide faction buffs hit. You'll get an entry in your combat log when they gain the buff even if they're stealthed, just like you get one today if someone buffs a stealthed rogue near you.

I remember begging a fishing undead lvl 50-60 with emotes to help me with the Stromgarde elite quests. He actually stopped and started helping me, up until the end when we wiped to Otto and Falcon. We killed Otto and then some 60 hunter with his buddy (A) came in. I asked them if I could join (the hunter was a dick already). While killing the elites, my undead buddy respawned and got prompty decimated by the hunter. I apologized to him on our discord, never knowing if he actually read it. Wenn du das hier zufällig liest: tut mir leid, man! Danke für die Hilfe!
---
It's made leveling so much more enjoyable for me, I'm on sulfuras which is pretty even faction wise I believe. And every zone I've been lvling in for the past 4 days has had small scale 60's fighting outside everlook or the volcanoe in ungoro or the bulwark in the western plague lands. And being able to join in for abit to break up the leveling has been a godsend! 
---
And then there's all the little duels in the middle of nowhere that have been a blast aswell!

Blizzard: creates terrain
---
Players: uses terrain

Blizzard: \*surprised Pikachu*

If they don't want players doing this they should just add invisible walls.

Kids trying to flex on you dw ive farmed brd with 4 dps and a healer he was just a greedy shit cunt that hasnt got his epic mount yet and wanted others to work for it for him imo put him on blacklist

One shot him without issue yesterday. No threat issues. Although we do run 30 mages, so maybe that's the reason.
---
Except... The gear isn't available yet. This week no one will get past rank 4 and the climb up will be relatively slow moving forward. Tomorrow we'll see trinkets and a few necklaces. 
---
Also... The gear isn't overpowered. T1 sets (and set bonuses) are stronger than the blue sets, and debatable when comparing to the epic sets. Only the weapons are significantly stronger than anything else available now, and we won't see any rank 14s for a few months.
---
That should be good for Mara and ST groups.
---
That's where /point /charge come in real handy!
---
It sells the same day. You make 50g per hour in brd it cant compete with devilsaurs. You do you.

Excellent! I knew I found my guild when I was invited to &lt;Silmarils&gt;

Breaking news:
---
Large swathes of players baffled by concept that other, sentient beings don't enjoy being a glorified pinata in their recreational activities.
---
Never been more glad to be PvE
---
As an arms warrior I feel the same. Hell even when I’m in a group with a dps warrior most of them either won’t or don’t when or how to off tank if things get messy. Create a macro to switch to sword and board go in defensive stance go to work.
---
Troll sweat is not a magical juice
---
You can definitely still get into Hyjal! I did it a few weeks ago by following [this video](https://youtu.be/gbwVvK5XLb4).
---
With a pally, once the warrior is on you, he's on you till you die. You can't snare/kite/cc them. You can't kill the pally before the warrior kills you.
---
With a sham, if you don't get global'd(WF only has 20% chance) you can snare/kite/cc the warrior and kill the sham a lot easier than a pally.
---
We cleared him first shot on Sunday night and actually beat our previous best time. He dropped aggro once but OT picked up and held for about 20-30 seconds before main tank got aggro back. Nothing out of the ordinary tho.
---
Get shit on
---
very nice work on the "map" of important keys! a few things that might make it even better:
---
- capslock is also a decent key, though imho best used for long cooldown "ohshit" buttons
---
- 4 (and 1) should be exceptional - you can easily reach those while running forward, while 2-3 take quite a bit of wrangling. binding 1 and 4 to instants that you cast on the move and 2-3 to spells with cast time is generally a nice tactic
---
- while warlocks aren't able to make use of it, hybrids can easily do something fun with spell-swap macros - cast a healing spell when targeting a friendly target and throw out damage when you target is an enemy
---
Sorry, this idea is too fun and therefore will not be implemented by Blizzard. Hell, they've even given up free money for race change, character transfer, server transfer on Classic, which is more robust than WfA. I can't tell whether they're incompetently greedy or greedily incompetent
---
impossible
---
People need to quit saying this is what vanilla was like. 
---
It wasn’t. 
---
There are thousands more people playing per server which means a faction imbalanced server will see what we saw on Friday and Saturday nights in Vanilla at Thorium Point or TM/SS -now at every neutral Flight point, every hour of every night from about 5-midnight and all day on weekend.
---
There was griefing, but not these constant raid size roving groups that kill every enemy player in the zone, no matter what the level, as soon as they land and then camp them and don’t let them hearth or fly out.
---
In every zone from red ridge to winterspring. 
---
There wasn’t even that a week ago in classic.
---
This shit just happened to me. Joined a scholo group as a 59 druid healer literally 2 minutes after I had just finished a scholo run. Party lead kicks me from group after I had already jumped on the flight path. Didn't respond to any of my messages like a little bitch. Only reason I could think is because I'm 59.
---
Nice dude. :)
---
They have been trying to fix it with larger ranges kn guards etc.
---
Last patch they attempted a fix.
---
Good to know thank you, Aragul is about 60-40 and mass population so it's rough
---
Unpopular opinion: Saying "unpopular opinion" in your title followed by something that is obviously a popular opinion is clickbait and should be downvoted accordingly.
---
Better roll a pve server if you think this.
---
That’s so satisfying to see. I want to see more GM action on Grobb.
---
Takes about 100-300 hours played, depending on whether you skip professions and stuff.
---
Come actual difficult progression content and premade BGs paladins really shine.  Alliance will pull away with early progression in AQ and Naxx and a good alliance premade with a couple holy pallys will basically be impossible to defeat.
---
I know. It will be a looooooooot worse in classic than it was in vanilla. It would take a large sum of money to get me to do it again in classic.
---
That's the thing with vanilla vs. Classic. In vanilla, there were ~3000-4000 active players even on the high population realms. A huge portion of the population was casual and didn't hit 60 for a year and change, and maybe only 40% of those players were the same faction, so there might only be 700 same-faction 60s on your server. A guild of 150+ 60s had a lot of power.
---
In Classic? Hah, good luck. Your guild is one of many. It's not possible for one guild to rule the server anymore.
---

---
explanations:
---
**Malice:** because more crit is more dmg (duh)
---
**improved gouge:** longer CC, plus allows for extra energy recovery time. since it takes it to 5.5 seconds, it means that it is essentially a free skill, since it costs 45 energy, but you will regen. 60 nearly after it finishes.
---
**lightning reflexes:** you want to stack as much dodge as possible with this build. youll see why later.
---
**precision:** more hits = more damage. shockingly more damage.
---
**deflection:** more parry = getting hit less, and also a pre-req for:
---
**riposte:** EXTREMELY good skill. 10 energy, 6 second CD, massive damage. disarms enemy so you take less damage. can literally be used back to back as long as you parry within 4-5 seconds of eachother.
---
**improved sprint:** this is gunna be one of the last talents you take. i chose this *specifically* to deal with frost mages. pop sprint as soon as they use frost nova, and they cant get away from you.
---
**improved kick:** good for both pve and pvp. 2 second silence on an 8 second effective CD.
---
**blade flurry:** kind of just a bonus talent that lets you still dps in dungeons and solo grinding. also a nice atk speed increase for pvp if you need it and dont wanna spend combo points. bonus for if two enemies are next to eachother.
---
**master of deception:** highly underrated. 100% needed for pvp imo, and really good for pve. especially leveling. i've saved so much time not having to kill mobs since i can stealth right past them. including mobs 2 or 3 lvls above mine.
---
**elusiveness:** vanish and blind on a 3.5 min CD is REALLY nice. you should pretty much never die in pve.
---
**camouflage:** dont need all 5 points. but you need a reduced CD on stealth to comfortably restealth after u blind someone in pvp. the movement speed bonus is also really nice for saving time, as well as chasing slowed targets in pvp.
---
**ghostly strike:** THE fucking skill. 15% dodge for 6 seconds on a 20 second CD means it effectively has a 13 second CD. good damage, lower energy cost than sinister strike, and adds a combo point. currently at lvl 48, i have 25% passive dodge, so with ghostly strike, i can either rotate it with evasion to give me 7 seconds of 40% dodge, 15 seconds of 65% dodge, and then another 7 seconds at 40% dodge. OR you can stack them together for 7 seconds of 90% dodge and then the last 8 seconds of evasion at 65% dodge. **you do. not. get. hit.**
---
**initiative:** almost always procs. gives 3 combo points total on cheap shot, which means you only need one or two more for your follow up kidney shot.
---
**setup:** we are stacking dodge here, so you  might as well get free combo points when you do dodge. most fights against mobs my level, i end up getting a total of 8 combo points between this talent and skills that add combo points.
---
**improved sap:** lets to engage a pair of humanoid mobs by staying in stealth after sap, which means you still get your opening on the second one. also 100% needed in pvp impo.
---
**prep:** the ultimate tool. the "oh shit" bar for rogues. resets every.single.cd. you have. this will allow you to pretty much 1v1 anyone, and survive any engagement.
---
**pros to this build:** very interactive and fun to play. insane utility, basically owns in pvp, regardless of if its a caster or melee character. high survivability, still good damage. not a lame ass cookie-cutter build. this helps because people will not be expecting you to have the talents you have. and my favorite part: find a weapon that is an upgrade? you don't have to worry about what type it is: this build works with ANY WEAPON TYPE. you obviously want to prioritize slow main hands, but it very much still works with a dagger if you want, its just less optimal.
---
**cons to this build:** a little less damage than other builds. loses a lot of value if you aren't getting attacked (i tank caster mobs in dungeons anyways lmao) since you require dodging or parrying for a lot of your value. might get laughed at for not playing the "OptImAL buILd".
---
i personally hate cookie-cutter builds, and this fits my play-style perfectly, and i love it. there are a number of ways you can choose to prioritize the talents as you level up, but i would first prioritize riposte, then get ghostly strike ASAP. I did it the opposite way, but didn't realize how freaking op riposte is.
---
lmk if you have any questions. I'd also love to hear your feedback, both at first glance and after you try it, if you decide to.
---
Easly fixed by adding another line of code: cannot be ised in combat.
---
I mean, I’ve been raiding without it with no problems
---
how do i keybind rogues stealth button?
---
I have successfully made it through lyceum twice with our only AoE being two bears. Swipe swipe swipe! Faaaar from ideal but really fun
---
luthien was half goddess(maiar), half elf, Beren was full human.  Arwen is like 13/16 elf and part human, while aragorn is a dunedain descended from the numenorian humans whose first king was Arwen's uncle Elros.  Both are descended from Beren and Luthien, Arwen much closer tho shes like their great grand daughter.
---
1) who needs rep lol
---
2) who needs gnomer when there is SM? and horde can teleport there anyway lol. Deadmines so what? Horde has WC
---
3) okay this is decent I agree
---
4) this is good but undead racial is still better
---
5) Deeprun tram so what? It only saves you a minute in comparison with a flight and it is being camped by undead rogues so the majority is using a flight anyway
---
6) okay this is also decent I agree. IF &gt; Kargath
---
So the alliance’s advantages are actually paladins and easier flights to high level dungeons. This is basically it
---
How many kilonewton from a sinister strike?
---
Personally i played both factions both on classic and vanilla. Both have their strong sides.
---
Always preferred alliance Menethil boat over Zeppelins.
---
Dwarfs have the racial that counters "better PvP shadow priests" (any disease), any bleeds (rogues, warriors, even feral druids), any poisons. Dwarfs also get Fear Ward priests which very well counters fear the same way WoF does. Which makes them arguably the best PvP race.
---
Gnomeregan (Dun Morogh) has the leather agility pants as a quest reward that last until pre-bis (rogues, feral druid, warrior, hunters)
---
Paladins are the best healers in the game hands down. With built in FAP and 12 second immunity against ALL damage and CC effects allowing not only to effectively reset any PvP fight, but also ignore almost any raid boss mechanic.
---
Humans have insanely powerful weapon skill racials (best weapons in the game are mostly swords). Also have a very nice +rep racial that is relevant throughout all patches.
---
Gnomes basically have CC clear on demand and +int 
---
Nelfs have invisibility regardless of your class.
---
If you were alliance then your healer should've been able to manage a majority of the aoe for the party (Hurricane, Holy Nova, Consecration). If you're horde you can do similar things but I'm not sure if Fire Nova totem is strong enough from shamans but it should be fine with Magma I'd imagine.
---
I never played on pvp server, I just know a tool when I see one.
---
Shaman are great fun, I played one all the way thru original vanilla.  But they just can’t compare in group content.  As a shaman your best spell in BGs is purge.  You’ll be a purge bot, then a lightning bolt turret while throwing a few heals.
---
Lvl 53 warri here ...finally someone sees it like me ...love it.
---
There's one pull in the game where someone other than the tank pulls and isn't being stupid for it. That's on Garr where you use an iceblock mage to pull initial aggro and then dump it via iceblock to help banishes/tank aggro spreading around go smoother.
---
Everything else there's no reason why anyone other than the tank should.
---
But you sure are salty for some reason lmao
---
For the horde amirite lol rekt him
---
So alliance just gets fucked for picking that faction, lol.
---
Yeah, time to spread the fucking around some.
---
Yeah, although horde still deathball or nothing on Herod in my experience. But tbh compared to day 1/2 it almost feels like a majority of the horde are just, well gone.
---
One is against the TOS and the other isn't.
---
Well, I am just going to be ahead and say that one thing are skirmishes, other is the dominant faction in a server campaign every other flight point making a lot of stuff almost impossible, especially leveling.
---
Ahh the go to retail comment. Yeah I just hate that shit in general. Elitist fuck comment, I give 2 shits about pvp so wrong salt my friend.
---
&gt;just healing
---
Healing refreshes their aggro as well.
---
It's actually by 35%, called improved cone of cold. I included that.
---
Its mutch better to do solo or up top 5man squads, ask anyone that are in the top brackets. They havent been raiding in southshore
---
Go for it.
---
This is just structured so poorly I can’t even laugh
---
Yeah, I don't think either side has it well. I know other ally complain about not being able to get to brd or such but we were literally doing that to horde for hours as well. Same for anyone questing. With the amount of people everywhere it's destined that each faction will get fucked
---
it "could" but players that pick pve i think did it for 2 reason, 1&gt; they dont like pvp, and therefore wont be in Q for bg's anyways  or 2&gt; they do like pvp and will Q but the same % of horde players on a pve server should fall into this as well.  
---
so i dont think you will get t
---
I feel this post so hard lol.  Minimum 5 corpse runs to BRD. The real crime here though, is that someone at blizzard thought it was a good idea to NOT put battlegrounds in phase 2....
---
&gt;Hide enemy faction information from the log if they aren't actively affecting a member of your fraction.
---
I still think this would break cast bar addons which are more important in PVP (to me) than spy. I want to interrupt heals too.
---
Horde player: *creates a 10000th shitty post about choosing a pvp server and gets downvoted to oblivion*
---
Horde player: pikachu face
---
True I'm 55 right now. It's a jungle out there. Just gotta get super crafty &amp; sneaky. I try to be communicating with everyone in a zone at all times, get everyone to always call out horde when they see em so I get a heads up. Tryin to stay ahead of the curve out here.
---
Don’t listen to those elitist trolls that probably don’t even PVP.
---
The concensus between all PVPers is that the Vanilla WPVP release was never like that due to multiple factors.
---
Size of servers
---
The fact that we had 15 years to learn min/max
---
Yes PVE transfers is a solution but there’s also others that you can do on a PVP server while the situation calmdown.
---
All people that play for the honor grind won’t be camping boats, zepp or flightpoints. They’ll be in group of 5 roaming and trying to get honor worth targets in zone like Black Rock Mountains, WPL, EPL or Winterspring.
---
I do like pvping a lot but the big raid meta is kinda stupid and pointless since it’s not efficient if you want to farm honor. So I have my solutions to get out of their ways.
---
I farm gold in zones that I can get good 1v1.(Silithus caves for rogues)
---
I do more instances (Pickpocket BRD and trying to get some BiS/reagents)
---
Play with a group of 5 guildies.
---
Level a profession.
---
You have to take into account that everything you’ll do will take more time for the next weeks.
---
It’s honestly not worth the grind imo (I’m a warr). Do brd whenever it’s convenient do you feel like it, maybe one day you farm it a few times, whatever. Meanwhile, get the alternative DPS chest pieces, plenty of options, you just lose out on 2% crit basically which sucks but would that really propel you into a new level of pwnage?
---
Frost nova into cone of cold on those weaklings is very satisfying. I want ocerpulls to happen in that room so I can round them up then assert my mage dominance in two globals :d
---
As horde in a horde dominant server I’ve basically quit any form of ganking   It’s not fun.  I would say to you though OP, don’t toss all your work and progress away, and don’t take the first week of honor as what it’s gonna be going forward.  This week is going to have been the worst of if IMO.  It’s not going to get better overnight, and there will always be goon squads out there,  but people are gonna see that they won’t just get free easy pvp gear.  Even the blue set will take a while and it’s just difficult without BGs.
---
Things will get a bit better, and I honestly think Blizz is going to cave to the complaints and we’ll see WSG at least in a few weeks.
---
Oh I know. But if we're considering deviate delights overpowering the horde, surely shamans have to be broken *somehow* in OPs mind.
---
Neat trick I've yet to meet anyone else who knows about. Shamans can purge mind control off fellow horde. Because they are being treated as the same "side" as the mind controller, the game considers the mind control to be a positive buff.
---
Blizzard only, don’t AE spam, downrank CoC if only used for kiting, rank 1 nova 
---
Smaller pulls can also help
---
They are still going to have hour+ queues, the vast majority of PvP servers are Horde dominated, and PvE servers are mostly 50/50, maybe 55% Alliance.
---
Why would you assume I'm a horde player lol
---
Kromkrush server transfers really fucked with the server I believe. Lost tons of alliance. We were one of the more balanced servers if I’m not mistaken. They shouldn’t have allowed transfers from ours IMO
---
even if you die as a horde in WPL the grave yard is still right there at the bulwark
---
You realize the logic of your post results in all servers being PvE servers, right?
---
If alliance PvP all roll PvE....
---
Man do you deserve those downvotes buddy.
---
Advanced tip:  *LF healers and casters for BRD arena farm, level 52+ welcome.*
---
You might have to kill like 3-5 extra mobs if they pull, and make sure they walk a tight rope on the left side of the ramp going into arena, but level 52s can help just fine.
---
Just make sure they agree to pass on chest if there are any hunters or shamans, or avoid those classes.
---
The lower level players are grateful for the free gear, XP and gold.  Plus they like a level 60 tank running it.
---
If you look at most complaints it tends to be when people put minmaxing above all else/act like complete dicks about it. 
---
There's been minmaxing in every game, but when people lose their shit because item X is an upgrade for person Y but "BiS" for person Z, or lose their shit because someone isn't perfectly optimising their character from level 1? It gets old.
---
Basically the practice of doing well isn't a problem, the toxicity and elitism that some people spew in the name of it certainly can be though.
---
It won't make a difference when horde have to wait 40 mins in que
---
As if you took that seriously, haha.
---
If we don't get BG's by the time people are close to r13/14 I'd bet on more like 18+ hrs a day since people won't follow brackets and there's no way to enforce it without being able to farm BG's fast
---
Omg that's amazing. *heart eyes*
---
I think they don't realise they have been healed, and just see it as you CCing them.
---
this isnt a horde player,horde dominate 95% of the classic pvp zones,this OP is alliance full stop.
---
Same thing happened to me. I'm going to try again after the server reset.
---
Dont bother, if they dont see the exitement in a fair pvp fight then its all the same to them 1v1 or 10v1 "its pvp rules bro" 
---
Personally i dont see the fun in doing the same stuff in molten core twice a week, its the same mechanics and same fights. Every. Single. Time.
---
In pvp you never know who youre up against, which pots and grenades he brings and how he fight in general, unless of course youre fighting half a raid on your own because everyone rolled horde on this server
---
Times will be better
---
So much of the classic wow experience is about interacting with the opposite faction.  Raid scale world pvp, pulling off that 1v2 or 2v3.  Competition for resources and world bosses.  Reputations and competition between opposing faction’s guilds.
---
Neither side will get to experience those on an imbalanced realm.  This is the best time there ever will be to play classic wow and get the full experience.  And instead players on imbalanced realms are pointing fingers at each other and they’re both going to miss it.
---
If you’re horde on a server as 70+% of the population you might as consider it a pve server.
---
Great explanation
---
Agreed, there's only one faction to blame.
---
There's to many people on each server for people to safely be able to 1v1 each other, esp if it's faction dominated
---
Pretty sure the morrowgrain quests give CC rep
---
On my server, Alliance numbers the Horde 3 to 1
---
And most of them will stop eventually once the realization hits that only 1.4% can get to rank 11
---
Well, I like running instances and healing. So I will just suck it up
---
Don’t worry the hype will die out in a couple of weeks and everyone will be back at running raids and dungeons. 
---
Just like it did with launch, first weeks were a nightmare. It got better over time. If you can sit it out patiently for a week or two it will be back to “normal” aka before phase 2.
---
Dude I laughed so hard at that
---
Going solo isn't an option. 3-5man squads is better, it's decent if you go southshore together
---
Nothing. That's the problem.
---
It says it on the ironforge.pro site

---
Take 2
---
Was eating, so had the camera off really quickly.
---
That right there makes 0 sense sir
---
Except the flip side is it's simply not worth the time and effort to re-roll. Either BGs come out and everything smooths out or Blizz offers server transfers to PvE realms.
---
I'd rather quit the game entirely than start from scratch right now.
---
This is so true... Vanilla was so much more small scale and tight nit, especially for that first year.  Many high levels knew each other regardless of guild at first... Fun times!  No more though, now the game is just filled with a bunch of whiny self entitled loot mongers reading BiS lists, regurgitating internet memes, and reciting whatever the internet says is the right way to play the game.
---
This needs to be upvoted
---
salty ally
---
This
---
These are two different issues: 
---
A) you should have expected this because it was just like this in Vanilla 
---
B) you should have expected this because it was predictable because of what we learned from Vanilla.
---
A is flat out bullshit. 
---
B is correct. 
---
It can’t be both.
---
I’m not whining about what it is now, I’m pissed at the people who keep insisting that this is exactly what happened at this point in Vanilla as a way to dismiss the complainers. 
---
If people want to quit because it’s not fun and they want to tell us why they’re quitting, that’s their choice.
---
If you don’t want to hear people complain, you can choose to tell them not to complain and encourage them to quit.
---
Just don’t lie about it. 
---
And when bg’s come out and the currently low imbalanced faction on your server gets their gear that much faster because their ques pop while the dominant faction is stuck waiting, I’ll defend your right to complain, too.
---
The 60s are busy with pvp raids farming HKs. Good time for an alt!
---
What's so strong about troll SP?
---
Honestly, this game always was RNG as hell. So in PvP anything goes regarding procs of any passive ability. You can ignore any stuns for 3 hours straight as an orc and then always get stunned for a week. I play as a rogue and it's not that big of a deal when you can use other tools.
---
Ya that's an oof.
---
Don't you guys have alts?
---
Thanks hopefully this will help
---
r/woosh
---
PvP is new content so it makes sense it’s at the top of the feed. It’s also something that effects people, both those PvPing and those getting engaged on. So it’s a lot of PvP clips and people getting mad they got clipped. You’ll need to wait a while for the type to die down because most of this sub has already experienced the leveling nastalgia posts or the early raiding posts... there isn’t all that much more to add. Maybe with next phase you’ll see more PvE related stuff and people doing other stuff.
---
a jab at whiners, but also i want bgs. is that so complicated?
---
When does honor ranks get distributed out? I'm guessing tomorrow?
---
Respec asap or respec at 36 once you get whirlwind and stance dancing really starts popping off. You can also dual wield fury with a stop cast macro on heroic strike (read about it if you dont knkw what it does) its more apm heavy but its nasty single target dmg.
---
I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were me! I totally forgot that I have to actually look for these runs. Silly me!
---
Kazzak spawned tonight on Herod after aldo spawning Thursday
---
Well nobody considers that a grind... For sure.
---
Fun detected
---
Confirming every assumption people make about current mages iq, right there.
---
Makes you feel like a boss when you pull it off too.
---
I reported another horde the other day, not for this, but because I was farming fire eles, and every time I tagged one he would banish it and keep it banished so I couldn’t kill. I asked him nicely to stop impeding my progress, he said if I don’t like it to leave because he’s farming the fire eles now. He hasn’t ignored me because I’ve checked on other toons as well but I haven’t seen him on in days, I’m hoping he got banned for being a douche
---
Calming down because you can't both farm honor and gold and mats and bis. Oh and there is a raid reset tonight.  If you pvp'd during your typical grind for your elixirs in MC, then you are scrambling to get them before Tuesday night.  It will be entertaining to see how many groups struggle with MC because they can't zone in with world buffs anymore.
---
Abusive speakers? Bug reports? Offensive names?
---
Boohoo
---
I’ve seen this come up when people rolling need for an offspec. For example a DPS shamen asked if he could need on a healing trinket. Clearing with healer first Incase that guy needed it for his main spec he would greed.
---
Also people don’t want a ninja reputation and are also paranoid as DPS that they will get kicked for needed on the wrong thing by accident.

Last night GM Tessolaan came down from Planet Vulcan and said if I didn't stop rooftop camping, that they'd melt my brain.
---
Have your raid meet in theselmar and run together as 40’peoole through the tunnel into the searing gorge
---
No firm census, but around 55H/45A. Great community though. 100v100 in SouthShore on days 1 and 2 with ebbs and flows as to who was winning.
---
No roof camping that I've seen since phase 2 released. There was a lot in BB early on, but most of those characters haven't been seen for a while now.
---
It's like this because of overpopulation
---
It’s just really hard to understand sentences with no punctuation.
---
Really? What a worthless post.
---
Done both, nope Rhok'delar beats it. But AQ40 opening chain Q is still the very best quest.  
---
You are kinda like the James Bond of Azeroth in that quest.
---
I invited a 59 tank for Scholo and he was actually one of the best tanks I ran with in 5 mans.  He actually held threat and the healer was in discord raving about how easy it was to heal for him and thanking me for bringing him...and he started out being skeptical about how it would go.
---
That's still vastly inferior to 
---
- Gnome Intellect
---
- Fear Ward
---
- Human Sword skill (most prevalent weapon type especially for tanks)
---
- Paladin blessings and auras
---
Correction, I come here to watch everyone bitch and laugh at their pain :-)
---
 Back atcha
---
&gt; So basically a lot of salt &amp; bias? 
---
This is what you get from all this?  The only salt ( if that's even the definiton of my point ) I have is about the dungeons. You can't argue with that. Horde has 6, Alliance has 3 and Horde can teleport to one of them. It's as simple as that.
---
Why are you replying to an almost 2 day old comment.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP9BjKnDaFk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP9BjKnDaFk)
---
Because all spots outside of safe settlements are taken.
---
Then tell me how? actually contribute to some level of discussion? Do you not care about pvp? do you not care about the longevity of the game?
---
Let me guess. You play a class that can kill any char in the game while they are completely stunned before getting a chance to attack you back and you're complaining about fair?  
---
Learn to stealth when approaching hot areas before you see the enemy and the add-on doesn't tell ppl anything. 
---
Also you could try waiting 1min for the mage to stop spamming rank 1 arcane explosion and assume u moved on before opening. 
---
As for guessing in AB if you are already in stealth when they approach the add-on does not state you nearby.
---
If a target is inaccessible by guard due to terrain - kill the target.
---
Is it viable to use ranged weapons as a warrior while levelling and what level can i start using it? What’s the recommendation for ranged weapons for warriors?
---
Horde having better PVP racials is a wash considering Alliance have the better PVP class. Paladin are the strongest healer in the game in premade PVP.
---
I don't make alts.
---
It’s not balanced anymore. Been here since launch, slow leveler, at 43 and just getting murdered constantly. Talking 25+ deaths this evening.
---
All forgiven.
---
I'm a druid actually, and I don't typically try to steath around the enemies. Its not just about avoiding people in stealth, those were just examples of fundamental change to the gameplay. You used to be able to hide behind buildings/tree's and no one would know you're there without checking. It's going to fundamentally change the way the game is able to be played, I'm not just looking out for personal interests, cmon man, fuck rogues.
---
Play vs premades that will stomp anyone willing to PUG or solo queue PvP there.
---
Sounds great tbh, transfer sounds like it's in order!
---
its cross server...
---
Me either just new mains ;)
---
This wouldn't be classic boooo
---
Grobb is much fun!
---
I'm also having a blast, going solo/duo as the underdog faction and getting in all sort of crazy fights around the world. This is what I signed up for at launch and it's finally here. 
---
I think a lot of the people complaining were just not realizing what world PvP is when the world is populated. You get told, but you don't really know until you've experienced it. Those people would probably be better off on a PvE server and that's fine, seriously it is. Not everyone have the same playstyle.
---
Are you doing MC and Ony every reset? Honestly I wouldn't enchant it. I think thrash blade is technically a better OH and dal rend mh is rare as fuck.
---
Exactly :)
---
Do all your 5mans/10mans as 2h arms even at 60. Grind your prebis that way and then switch to fury for raid or fury prot if you also want to tank in raids
---
As a whole, PvP servers heavily favor horde, PvE slightly favor alliance. There's really nothing that they can do, it's what the player base chooses. If they open up free transfers the same problem becomes much, much worse.
---
I’d roll either Undead Mage or Gnome anything... though Warlocks are hella good for PvP and also much needed in Raids so it’s a solid option. Paladins also kinda nutty at times. If you want to invest some time and don’t like solo play than Warriors also quite versatile and fun class on either side.
---
Level toon on PvE server, untill phase 3 in Feb 2020.
---
Yes it's like a race to kill someone and impossible to find a fair fight.  It's not fun outnumbering alliance.
---
dont worry, i got black listed earlier today for saying "dont tell me what to do" after someone told me as a shadow priest to heal. the second i said that i got kicked. came back later tonight was in a group killing alliance in tarren mills healing for them and this guy joins and a few seconds later i get kicked. apparently i had an "attitude" these people are fucked in the head.
---
So basically, your gripe with my post is from you assuming an assertion I never made? I literally never said it was 'exactly what happened in vanilla'. I said it's a rereleased game, therefore predictable in how it would play out, so something you shouldn't really complain about when the predictable happens.
---
I barely post on reddit, I just lurk, but this subreddit is turning to trash because of complaints. I know it'll die down, as the general zerginess of wPvP dies down, but the entitlement people have to 'play in peace' when they signed up to an always-on PvP situation, is illogical. Trashing the game (again - when we KNEW from past experience that World PvP would be like this) and generally being majorly butthurt about the other faction (the serious reactions to OP's "g o t o re t a il" posts are legit laughable) do not make for a good forum experience. Negative energy should not be lauded about as a right. You have the right to not like the game for what it is, but why would you want to bitch and whine about it to people? Let people enjoy what they want, if it's not your cup of tea, move on and do what you do enjoy. If that involves rerolling to PvE, so be it, it doesn't need a declaration post on reddit.
---
&gt; And when bg’s come out and the currently low imbalanced faction on your server gets their gear that much faster because their ques pop while the dominant faction is stuck waiting, I’ll defend your right to complain, too. 
---
Man, you sure do make assumptions a lot. I play Alliance on a maybe 40:60 Horde favoured realm. Horde zergs are everywhere. I don't like dying. But this is EXACTLY what I signed up to a PvP server for.
---
too lazy to punch in the command i guess. Or didn't know.
---
Griefers don't care about rank, they are in it for the troll factor.
---
Sure, over the course of the 30-40 seconds it takes to wall jump up there so long as they are okay eating the 90 shadowbolts and frostbolts the opposing teams hits them with as they do so....
---
Cya
---
Oh ok, fair enough.
---
It's not too late but you're going to have a brutal experience for the majority of it.
---
Breathe brutha damn...
---
No, no you don't.
---
&gt; bootybay and everlook. People are spamming kills, (including me), 
---
\*get reported and banned
---
Also 2 exploits are the reason a whole system is bugged nice elaboration... correction bad elaboration
---
It would be similar to a mage not being able to out range a warrior without doing some gay ass side hopping shit while still being fearable, stunnable or slowable. It's not that the class can't get to the rough it's that it's near impossible to do it while a) staying alive or b) getting there with enough HP left to have a remotely fair fight.
---
It feels like a now complete game to me. I played on PvE before and it just me felt like game features were missing and absolutely no tension in quest zones. If it wasn't for Pvp servers I'd quit after a few raids.
---
I mean you clearly care about bg's, do you not worry how spy addon will impact them? Don't understand the hostility.
---
Warmode was really bad, including the phasing.
---
&gt; Paladin is a meme anyway :P
---
this really shows how insanely uninformed you are lmao
---
Bro you spoke to my soul , idk what it was i felt drained , i just went and played m+ on my retail mistweaver
---
I feel dirty after that. My /played was sicko mode too i got to 51 in like 4 days game time
---
Nah, It's just that's how I like it.  
---
Having auto-attack on 1 (and not having startattack macro) is more like a tradition for me, that's how I (and everyone else started), I just kept it. Also I don't use the "ability which is on different stance, but make a macro which switches stance and uses a spell, like Overpower", I usually just switch to battle-stance and use the ability, I like less button. Maybe not most efficient, but that's how I like it.
---
the problem was every single server would be dead because 60% of the people logging in to each server were tourists
---
bro im gonna do it for us , for both of us
---
You can definitely heal as Shadow until you're doing raids.
---
&gt; , as their time and dedication put in wasnt to recreate the vanilla experience 100%.
---
I use my words very deliberately and __should__ has a very different meaning than __is__. I know what they have committed themselves to. But they SHOULD have done something else.
---
hehe I try
---
You have to be able to see someone to target them. Spy does nothing game breaking, it simply notifies you when an action occurs in your logs.
---
Well.... did you kill her or not? Don’t leave us in suspense.
---
You haven't used it? You definitely don't have to see someone to target them. They just need to be in range.
---
It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Velsharoon, son of the king, took up his father's sword.
---
Why is it better than waiting for the tank to pull?
---
There's not much wiggle room there. I know frost nova has a pretty big range, but when I'm finishing up that second blizzard they're already nearly in my face. I don't wanna waste mana by cutting it off too early.
---
As a pro tip to save on repair costs, you can hellfire to death and it doesn't cause you to lose durability.
---
I DONT WANNA CLOSE MY EYESSS
---
Yup. It was hard as fuck to do my weekly +10 or higher on an almost Mythic level geared Ret Pala but easy as fuck to do a +10 on my pleb Rogue. 
---
During the last raid tier, I also had a tank for keys and I would take anything. Casters? Off meta spec? Who cares, it's only a +10. Plus, it was really enjoyable modifying routes for interrupts and CC availability.
---
Sorry, I just don't agree that it's going to ruin everything. Everyone can run it, thus it's a pretty much even play field. Rogues get hurt by this the most and I'm okay with that
---
You mean an aoe stun on a 2 minute cooldown that lets you disable and escape anyone who's in close proximity to you?
---
Yeah I'll take that over 1% dodge any day of the week.
---
Enjoy your singeplayer game who cares
---
I've used it the entire time it's been out. It doesn't allow you to do anything against ToS.
---
That too, my server has horde camping BRM 24/7 and it's at least imbalanced 4/1 to horde if not more. Probably closer to 6/1 or more but Blizzard won't release the numbers.
---
Except heartseeker which is ~80% alliance, unless it has dramatically changed with faction locked transfers.
---
Or just deal with pvp as intended. Ez. Frivolous heavy handed “solutions” help no one.
---
yup it's funny because my work buddy who I only see one time a week was bullshitting about it and I said I was done I haven't played in almost 2 weeks. I may go back to retail I cant find groups blah blah.. The next week I talked him about how i had just done MC the night before and I couldn't wait to go home and farm Strat for my mask and gloves.. I literally had like 2 friends quit at 52 after going hard as shit.
---
God, that's always been the absolute worst argument, I don't know why people refer to it.
---
So if everyone can maphack, then who cares about maphack, doesn't ruin anything right?
---
It's not about the field being uneven, it ruins the experience that the game was designed around. You can't hide behind buildings like you used too, along with all the other examples I gave.
---
Plus if you're okay with it hurting a class you don't like then you're opinion is pretty biased anyways.
---
The difference is now people know how to play the game, people didn't stop doing arenas because they couldn't get duelist gear or above when duelist was the top gear.
---
Who do I think I am? Let me tell you who I am. I am world first level 60 in fucking classic wow. I can do whatever the fuck I want. You think I'm a random player? You think I'm a fucking random player? Let me fucking clue you in bitch. I am the the guy who had 350 fucking thousand viewers playing this fucking game. Me, not you. The most views ever on this game. The first guy to hit 60. I can do whatever the fuck I want.
---
I'm playing Warlock but I'm thinking about rolling a Holy/Ret hybrid Pally instead of Warrior alt. And, I feel attacked lol
---
How'd you figure that? I have a few buddies with over 40k honor already.
---
I'm not trying to instigate here but why don't they just remove the ability to get on the roof then.  It seems pretty intuitive for a ranged class to seek a position of advantage like this.  For sure it is a more severe case, but how is it fundamentally any different from someone utilizing line of sight against a ranged ability.
---
Never said it did anything against ToS, you did say that you need to see them and just edited your answer otherwise though, so you clearly didn't understand how it works, it notifies you of things logs TRACK but not things log DISPLAY, it gives you information you otherwise couldn't access.
---
So try going on a server that's completely imbalanced and play on the side that has the low numbers, then go during peak hours on raid nights to MC / Ony.
---
The serious rankers have started ranking and that means 8+ hours a day ganking people out in the world until they hit 14 or battlegrounds are released.
---
If you don't think the epic sets are overpowered then you have honestly no idea what good gear looks like and without accusing you of too much, probably have spent less time theory-crafting than you should have before commenting on the quality of those pieces.
---
For Rogues for example, several blue pieces are already best in slot. Not even the epic set. For warriors, any combination of 2 blue pieces for the AP set bonus is best in slot until AQ, you typically pick the 2 hardest to replace pieces, such as shoulders and legs. The epic set is even crazier.
---
The fact is, the UPDATED PvP sets came out much later in Vanilla, compared to available raid content than they are available in Classic. And hardcore players do not mind the grind, you need to understand we're talking about people who have gotten Rank 14 MULTIPLE TIMES, server after server and they have no issue at all with doing this.
---
The insane outdoor activity is largely motivated by the direct gear upgrades you gain from it over time. Even mentioning that next week is nothing major, because nobody will get the low ranks shows an incredible lack of understanding to how dedicated and hardcore these people are.
---
It's has always been a problem, because of the way the races look. Horde races look more evil and attract players who like to pvp. It was even a problem in WotLK when the human pvp trinket racial was OP.
---
work is da poop! NO MORE!!
---
I feel like I had kinda run out of quests that didnt feel like a massive chore. Only dungeon I could really farm for xp was ST and no one wanted to do it  and i really didnt either tbh.
---
Didn’t expect to see velsh on here 😂
---
I mean it depends on why the tank is there. If he's there to gear up like everyone else then sure I agree, but often fully geared tanks help others run dungeons and get the unwanted loot in return to pay for their time. This should of course be communicated beforehand to the group and in this case it seemed like it was.
---
&gt; But why are you alone as a holy paladin? As a healer and an alliance player to be successful at PvP you will need at least a few buddies. If you had a geared warrior, maybe a rogue and a mage next to you... you could be slaying horde left and right.
---
I definitely do group often! But "often" is key here. Obviously, like any normal person, I go to dungeons in BRM, or need to farm sometimes, or perhaps just none of my friends are on, which happens. *In those instances,* I basically have 0 honor per hour. By contrast, when a Warlock needs to farm, or is on his way to an UBRS run -- or just decides he wants to gank people! -- he absolutely can do so, as he's very capable of killing things alone, and it's actually quite possible to get better honor/hour alone because you don't split the honor amongst an entire raid group. 
---
In short: a Warlock *can* group with others to get honor, but a healer *must* group with others to get honor. That distinction matters quite a bit, and the problem is indeed alleviated significantly by battlegrounds.
---
And because something didn't get used back in shity vanilla days does mean some people aren't allowed to use them now ?
---
Many people don't care how it was back then and just play it now because they have fun how it is (including addons).
---
Elitist ...
---
Worst argument cause it doesn't follow your agenda ... Kay bro
---
Also map hack? You are comparing this to a map hack . This ain't an fps fool
---
That is actually pretty funny lol.. evil.. but funny. Not sure if it's a bannable offense though.
---
Wait honest question, are all structures under this rule? What if you can just jump right on and walk up?
---
My question is essentially regarding  the archway in Silithus and whether that spot is an "exploit"
---
the one who seeks the sauce might get lost in it . 
---
I will learn from this lesson and from you friend , i'll try to join a levelin guild and beg as much as possible , i had maxed out alch cause im like that and i might get to use it
---
what is the best quiver for a rogue to use? (yes i know many of you may think i'm a moron but I want to use one to min/max pvp)
---
This was how it was released in vanilla wow, it was like this for so long people would hit rank 14 before Bg's were even a thing.  I remember a druid on my server hit 14 but there were no spellpower or healing weapons added yet so he couldn't even get them because by the time they were added he had decayed a few ranks.
---
Don't worry guys, he has a big fuck so he has to be right. Says so in his username. 
---
Just because something IS exploitable doesn't mean you should exploit it, especially when you know it's a bannable offense. Additionally, if you think them banning you is "stealing", boy you better read that ToS. I can imagine bigdick here calling the police and report a robbery of game time.
---
I mean impeding progress is bannable, just not sure if farming eles would be considered progress. Either way haven’t seen him on in days and I like to think I dun did something good
---
Worst argument because its a bad argument, everyone being able to do something doesn't mean it's healthy or intended, I'm sure you know that.
---
I'm aware this isnt a FPS, this is a similiar MMORPG equivalent though.
---
Bare in mind that like in real life not all ppl think ahead or think at all. Having said that hopefully they will remove it cos its breaking the game and takes all the fun, but again retail players are used to this so I guess that's the reason all this posts get so much hate
---
Not as any way of doing damage. On higher levels the only purpose of ranged weapons is to carry some extra stats for you, and if you're a tank, you might occasionally use it to pull.
---
So you want something that isn't against ToS and doesn't break any in game mechanics to be banned because.... you don't approve of it?
---
Skeram was pretty even until the Alliance all mass transferred.
---
  The funny thing is the server they all transferred to is now just as imbalanced toward Alliance.
---
These are the people who love phase 2
---
I see 8 pve related posts the same hour you complain about this.
---
godes i miss layers, i could actually farm thorium in the world.
---
If only there was a icon people could click on when they were greedy for an item.
---
It also isn't a *shitty* escort quest, which is a nice change
---
O' shit, it's the cops!
---
2H Fury is great. It is actually better than DW until you get 2 Death Bringers. Biggest problem being that it relies heavliy on having Windfury to be competitive in a raid environment.
---
I remember it being pretty imbalanced.
---
Or reserve HoJ and you'll have no one else in your group.
---
I think Mograine (the picture) has Horde Majority, but the Horde is more like PvE oriented (even if it's a PvP server). Alliance here usually makes premades(seeing people in the same guild). Horde groups here usually just a retalation-group which killed by the Ally gank-squads so they want revenge.(there are Horde premades too but far less). I quested Sunday and Monday for gold in Plaguelands and it was under alliance control the whole time.
---
Mind is currently blown at the idea of healing BRD pugs as shadow
---
It's cheating to you, but not objectively.  Grow up.  Go message a pally that he's cheating for popping bubble jfc.
---
I'm telling you as someone who's actually done flag carrying on both factions, IMO war stomp is an amazing ability to have.
---
I don't know whatever scenario you're imagining in your head but when you're playing WSG both against premades and pugs where you will get caught out and having an extra out can decide the outcome of a game.
---
So in the odd case that a double druid set up needs someone with a rezz and that happens to have two extra abilities that work VS undeads - ret is now suddenly sought after?  Sorry bro, you dont make a case.  
---
The dude is clearly not happy about his current state of playing - and its entierly understandable - so people are recomending other avenues that they themselves find more fun or straight up better.
---
if its against the rules why can you even get up there?
---
I used throwing daggers until I recently found a bow with some stats on it (I'm lvl 44). Stats are basically useless (int/spirit) but it's something to act as a place holder until I get something with tanking stats. 
---
Charging is good for initially building rage but I've found that pulling with a ranged weapon makes a lot of pulls more manageable.
---
then they should correct it with code... not dumb arbitrary rules...
---
3000 health is not low.
---
Nothing about the current PvP meta is "in the spirit of classic WoW", that's a weak argument.
---
It tells you someone is in stealth, it doesn't tell you where they are or what they're doing. Eagle Eye removes the surprise of hiding behind a building too, same for Far Sight and Eye of Kilrogg. 
---
DBM wasn't factored into the game either yet it's the most used addon in the game. UI changes weren't either, or AH addons, or gathering helpers. 
---
Blizzard has already passed this over. If it were something they actually disliked it would have already been addressed like the LFG addon.
---
&gt; I’ll defend your right to complain, too.
---
RIP
---
Turns out people prefer it when others don't shit on and demand changes to something they enjoy. Dun dun dunnnnnnnn.
---
Cool deciding I'm a hypocrite, though, on like my first post in this subreddit. I really am the problem here.
---
its cause ur a clicker
---
I mean you just die like 10 times getting there doesn't seem much different than before lol
---
There's lots of pvp at SS and TM on a pve server
---
There's nothing to Datamine. Literally every item is in the game files and is locked behind server walls, not client walls. This is why when there is a new Phase, there is only maintainence and no actual patch.
---
You’ll get people saying fury and other saying arms. Playing a warrior as my main for years it’s always a lot easier to level with arms, and it’s much easier to tank dungeons as you’ll have tactical mastery so you can stance dance to generate more rage while using a shield and one hand which makes it less likely of the group wiping since you take less damage. Fury tanking can be hard to generate rage sometimes and with idiot dps who can and will pull mobs away from you making it even harder to get rage since your getting hit. If you don’t have a good healer it can cause wipes because of the increase damage if you decide not to use a shield which a lot don’t in order to  compensate for the rage issue. Arms is better for PvP also once you MS healing classes are easy to take down. Typically arms does more dps while leveling since you get huge crits from overpower and are able to stance dance that can generate a lot of rage. IMO fury doesn’t out due arms until you start getting some good gear at 60 from raids, but you will have to respect fury anyway since the debuff limit. Arms isn’t a shit class the fury warriors make it out to be you just have to know how to play it right which means a lot of stance dancing , always keeping battle shout up, and knowing a good rotation. I will say though, Some people do better with fury as it just fits their play style more but really if your playing mostly solo then just play whichever you find the funnest as that what really matters right.
---
I got spy in p1 so that I knew who was around me while I was either trying to lvl or farm mats. I still use it for pretty much the same reason in p2. If I'm actively looking for horde to pvp, spy is barely helpful. Using it while farming makes it so I don't have to constantly spin my camera around in panic mode while I'm trying to casually farm and relax.
---
ok so why don't they just go find an enemy that would be better to fight for them and let someone else of a ranged class handle them?
---
Honestly probably wouldn't have the gear at that point.
---
They are not true at all. I'm not certain you even understand how it works. Literally the 4 examples aren't real problems.
---
The problem isn’t that the encounters have threat mechanics but that The DPS don’t need to manage aggro and can go full DPS with Salv.
---
Pretty much the same on Bigglesworth, I couldn't even finish the last 10 levels because no matter what zone i'm trying to level in, three lvl 60's will just jump you. yeah yeah yeah, pvp server and all, but that doesn't mean I'm having fun when it's just a straight slaughter.
---
It doesnt matter if the entrance from Bulwark is camped similary like an FP point.
---
Love the haha sucked in post. 
---
It is like being killed in the wilderness in rs. 
---
It happens, its unfair, you might be able to fight back, more often than not you will end up dead.
---
Damn he mad yall
---
Yeah right) maybe it's because I played on Vanilla back in May 2005 on Deathwing PvP EU and there were nowhere as many gankers camping people 5 lvls below them in crap greens.
---
UPDATE: Can't move my characters off of kromkrush. Sucks to be me I guess.   
---
Gonna go play hitman instead. Actiblizz sucks. Democracy for hong kong.
---
Blizzard is Horde, I knew it!
---
The guy is level 13. Y’all talking about MC meta builds and level 40 builds. He has 4 points into talents. Fury is fine for leveling.  Yes, whirlwind, sweeping strikes and MS are awesome  when you get them, along with your WW weapon, but you will be rage starved. Tact mastery is awesome later on when you actually have reason to be stance dancing but for now, don’t stress it man. You can tank and level just fine as fury. Go arms at 40 for MS along with a beefy weapon if you want, but you will most likely switch back to fury for the increased rage gen from dual wield which is vastly more helpful than pooling rage so you can SS+WW every 10-15 seconds
---
Or you know you could be a decent human and follow the rules instead?
---
Advantege
---
I went into the game with that mindset back in the vanilla with most of my RPG experience being with Diablo 2. I would not recommend it. It's maybe 20% faster at the cost of sucking all the fun out of the game. You can't really do mass pulls and AoE them down unless you're a mage, and even then it's going to feel incredibly slow and unrewarding compared to Diablo.
---
Alternatively I need to get good at multiboxing different classes at the same time.
---
If any class can beat a good warlock it's prolly rogue, but it's still a decently hard matchup.
---
Warrior is a okay matchup as well, but considering that warriors are so weak in solo pvp, it's actually one of warriors best matchups.
---
no... I mean too many people. i play alliance on a horde dominated server (whitemane) and even if the horde were cut down to the alliance numbers, the sheer number of people on my server would still cause lots of problems. I dont really know how to fix it. but I know faction based ques dont solve THIS problem. faction based ques only help to deal with the faction balance problem
---
Well that also can be true I guess.
---
Me not that kind of orc!

If you bring others of your lvl range to the party you get more xp. That way the one boosting you could earn some gold aswll

You aren't trying to get off three blizzards in a row on one path, you're trying to get off four blizzards in a row on two paths. Three full uptime blizzards is not enough to finish the pack off with cone and AE, you need four. Nova when your second blizzard ends and then run far enough away that you can get two more blizzards in without moving much. If you have 6000 mana you can blink to make sure you have enough time to do this.
---
Have you gotten minor run speed to boots yet? That's important.

I watched him, his trap lasts for 16 seconds, I don't understand why mine are lasting for 6 seconds right now even if I don't use scatter shot.

Enchanting use to be a good profession because there were plenty of niche enchants that only a few people per server really bothered to acquire. Classic has been on farm since launch basically so if aenchant is currently in the game, dozens of people will be in a city willing to do it at any point. 
---
Same goes for any profession really. The days of making serious money off professions is over unless it's something like alchemy which will always be used. Even then, you're limited on resources and how many other alchemists there are.
---
I’ll say my bit I guess, I hate these posts but I also hate how everyone turns into an asshole when commenting on them. If it were up to me I’d say get rid of it. I play a priest and am the target of a lot of stealth classes and even I think it’s a little immersion breaking. I understand the stuff shows in the combat log too so really it’s not doing anything wrong and you could achieve the same thing by displaying combat log at all times. My opinion is just do that then, make it a little more effort for the advantage. And it’s not only stealth classes that are affected. Resurrecting and trying to get away is tough if your enemies have this which is a big part of pvp.
---
Having said all that I honestly will not care if it stays in. I know im kinda fence sitting here but there ya go. I also hate stealth classes and never plan on rolling one, that might be why I’m so indifferent.
---
Same time as the raids resets if that helps. I know it's 3am on wednesday for EU, not sure about the time for NA.
---
If you have 3 points in imp blizzard and permafrost, they will walk just shy of the diameter of the target graphic. If you have less points in those, I just make sure the closest point on the ground is about 10 yards away from where I'm standing. It just takes practice and then you just get a feel for it. Another point, blizzard will still hit them if they are standing just outside the target. So after I Nova, and make sure they all are rooted, I run as far away as I can, and I'm targeting blizzard as I'm moving. When I get to about max range, where the furthest point of the blizzard target just barely reaches the last mob, or right before nova runs out, is when I cast. Then I immediately target rank 1 blizzard without moving my mouse, and that way can see the area where they are being hit. Once blizzard runs out, or a mob has left the target area, I lay down rank 1. I only do that to keep them slow and wait for Nova too come off CD.
---
And you don't need any of them to tank 5 mans
---
lol fuck you
---
When I log while flying it rejoins my channels when I land.
---
So what you’re saying is that due to high competition and this being an early week, the honor grinder this week is worth much less than honor grinder in future weeks?
---
Oh look at the time! It's stop whining o'clock!
---
I'm surprised spy is getting a good reception from this reddit.
---
Guess i'm going to keep abusing that along with some other disgusting bugs to keep farming honor. I felt bad but now that people like you say it I guess cheating isn't really a big deal.
---
Rank 3 also gets you a 10% discount on your faction, so 20% total if you're Honored.
---
The maximum rank you can get this week is 4, if you are in the top few %. Not 3.
---
I thought thought the raid part was the case as well.
---
Boy was I wrong. Everything melts in seconds and everyone is a sniping flash machine, drinking from 0 to 100 between every pull.
---
where is the rule written? how would a new player even know about the rule? by being threatened with bans? what a great experience lmao.
---
Yeah that's not safespotting lol this coming from a fairbanks ally rogue who fights there. The path there is super obvious it's intended
---
exorsus raid tools on retail has build in maps + edit functions so u can do it ingame + share it with everyone in the raid. That is why it’s not supported 
---
U can do it in classic as well just no build in map so you need to draw it yourself or upload the maps. 
---
U can also use https://tacnet.io/tacsketch/ and upload your own maps (retail maps and enlarge them in paint)
---
Spy is kinda bad for the game, but not "Classic will die" bad. Its impact is really overblown. People act like it's maphack or something. This whinefest is mindboggling, the addon literally existed in vanilla. Everyone's so desperate for their classic experience to be utterly perfect that they overreact insanely to every little thing that isn't totally ideal.
---
More of these posts huh.
---
Yeah.
---
Dwarf SP and Paladins, swings and roundabouts.
---
I've healed strat as a druid many many times for that robes and neck without too much issue. They disease isn't a make a break but def makes it more challenging.
---
Because your JAQing off, and it’s annoying.
---
So in shadowlands we have another profession that we get to level up and craft our own poisons to apply to our weapons?
---
Sounds good.
---
1-3 are all false
---
1. it must not change the PVP experience because (especialy in BG´s) you wont notice any difference,
---
2. it was factored into the design, because it only shows you the combat log in a more conforting way
---
3. you can use stealth or hiding behind objects the same way as before, you just have to no cast spells there
---
If you don't know what a blue post is I have to wonder if you've been playing WoW for more then a day.
---
I've killed him about 8 times in the last few days. There's a spot right next to the barrels around the corner that seems to bug him out and send him running off towards the grim patrons. You can use the spot to dodge his casts but you need to move back out of cover as soon as he finishes casting so that he doesn't run off and agro more stuff.
---
such petty intervention. just let people fucking do what they wanna do.
---
/r/selfawareworgen
---
So anyway I made the AoE PvP screenshot post.
---
I don't play wow. this post hit all genius.... 
---
what I can't discuss what's going on cause I'm not part of the club? I tried it for a couple of days one time but eh didn't really see the point.
---
RIP shamy/pally 
---
Whole guild faction change:
---
Shamy"am i a joke?"
---
This is a we are not the problem they are the problem. 
---
Ends up the truth is we all are the problem. We all want to be on the big server and want others to move. 
---
Play on a smaller server you wont have alot of the issues you face. 
---
Population is a problem in current society now noone want to put there hand up and say i need to be removed for the greater good.
---
Where do people get the stats on server pop? Would love a link to it for personal reasons
---
The culture in wow is changing do much in retail and classic. Everyone's a fucking min maxer now and the group has to be a perfect comp. Fuck that give me them boomkins and prot paladins. Let's get this shit done.
---
It's only terrain exploiting if you exploit terrain defects to get there. You're supposed to be able to get on top of the inn there. No one is getting banned for that.
---
I know it's so fucking amazing. Haha. I've never seen smack talk met with such immediate animosity and hate in a game before. Love it.
---
With huge player populations, even with an over 60:40 split, there will be so many moving parts that queue times for the alliance will be instant, and the horde like 5 minutes at most.
---
It must be in bhu, not round number.
---
Probably cos the rest of the guild are clickers too
---
How well does a basic macro work on equipping those items before mounting?
---
Incorrect. Terrain exploiting is defined as the terms of service blip and blue post as going anywhere the guards can not follow. ALL rooftops fall under this heading.
---
Some of your abilities generate a ton of threat. Get a threat meter to monitor it.
---
If alliance all roll pve, I’m still on my lvl 60 on a now pve server. Much better than starting a fresh toon. Why is my submoney less valuable than yours?
---
Rogues can Vanish or Feint to reduce their threat, and warrior threat is reduced by 20% outside defensive stance.
---
Warlocks have no suck luck - our threat is equal to our damage. If you're using Details, it has a built in threat meter you can use.
---
LBRS is one if the high end instances with less XP. Unless you kill everything which no group ever do.
---
or just like not play any version of wow.
---
If it's a PvP server, you can't have 2 characters of different faction on a realm. Unless you meant different realms.
---
Yes yes easy mode horde
---
&gt;I don't play wow. 
---
then why the fuck are you here?
---
&gt;I sometimes try fighting 60s but the warriors and paladins just beat my ass so easily, i dont bother
---
you have blink
---
Isn't Bulwark in horde territory where they can't attack you unless you're flagged?

“Learn your place, mortal!”

.... ok

&gt;***what I can't discuss what's going on cause I'm not part of the club?***
---
iirc its at 3am, but im not sure
---
Is there a list somewhere for server discords?
---
Can't wait until we have PvP groups, account sharing and grinding WSG 24/7.
---
Just be Venruki problem solved.
---
Currently doing that as red dead redemption2 has proven to be far superior
---
I’ve only encountered one toxic player so far during my 20 days /played on a high population EU-server Horde side.
---
probably via the ingame shop for real money 😂
---
Same with Strat live. Went from 58 to 60 in 6 runs
---
Doubt it’s a simple fix.
---
Not by myself
---
I’m so shitty at PvP.  I was lured in with tails of glory
---
You co to the link in browser and it will either prompt for you to sign in on the discord web app or open up your discord program and join you.
---
You can install census and help out.
---
lol no, with many servers being as bad as 80:20 or worse for horde there is going to be a noticeable difference between horde and alliance queue times. Just keep telling yourself there won't be though, that will make all the horde cry threads in Phase 3 that much funnier. The meta reddit response will change from "you should have rolled PVE to start" to "you should have rolled alliance instead of rolling horde zerg and crying about queues."
---
Any high population server will be socialable.
---
I don't even know how you could possibly judge one as the *most* sociable.
---
Why would you ever dare to assume that Classic would be some sort of cultural utopia stuck in 2005? Everyone playing Classic is part of the 2019 toxic internet era. This is as good as it's gonna get.
---
You're right, it is. At 6k mana you should not be afraid to cut off a blizzard a little bit early if it means not taking serious hits; you can afford to do this once or twice (whereas as you couldn't at 5400 or so in the prebis raid gear).
---
If you don't have run speed on your boots my advice to you right now is to get run speed and then go back and try some more pulls and see if it feels any better. You really can feel that enchant; it is a good enchant and also it is not expensive. See if you feel like you have more breathing room with it.
---
Keep trying; everybody that learned this died many times perfecting it and it is not as easy as the videos make it look. You will learn a lot about the leeway and spell batching mechanics from properly learning it.
---
Faction based queue. This new original idea is posted a few times a day and everyone thinks they are first to think of this "brilliant" idea.
---
Farming undeads is no fun
---
Thisisfine.jpg
---
Battlegroups had all server types in vanilla.
---
You are absolutely correct, my mistake. Now that you mention it, tanks usually don't go below 50% hp on any pull as well, so I shouldn't heal them above half health anyways, just wastes mana. Safety margin? Thats for idiots that make mistakes, that never happens to me or anyone I would ever play with, so its fine.
---
Skeram was 70/30 when transfers came lol
---
And I'm pretty sure the elixirs don't stack it just looks like it
---
He just said, in writing, to get off the roof, so I guess it's in writing, "lmfao"
---
Unpopular opinion: I think the spy-addon is a kinda of exploit / too much.
---
this is not entirely true. People will stop trying to maintain rank, which will then get the others still trying into that rank. 
---
Once someone gets rank 11, if they only care about the mount, they will likely stop pushing hard and then more will get to rank 11 - because of this, those stalled at rank 8-10 will likely continue to push.
---
Because they are all shitters who need a crutch.
---
My question stands, why the fuck are you here?
---
Wrong, i was just running around when my friends killing peeps, i got same amount of honor, it was 4ppl group, dunno about raid groups, but in party its works absolutely same as experience.
---
Reddit is primarily an environment for discourse, if you don't like that I would suggest finding a new platform to entertain yourself.  
---
I didn't just ask the question I made my statement clear, that it is intuitive for a player to find advantageous positions in a video game.  If this is not the intended behavior, then it should be removed or stopped preemptively.  It should not be arbitrated through a rule in the terms of service, of which virtually no one reads, nor should it have to be done manually by GMs on a case by case basis.
---
It's a meme. They're lying to you because they know retail players get a lot of hate. Sorry to burst your bubble lol
---
Got it done! Forgot to equip some mana gear and failed the first try with 4500 mana. Put on my pvp gear for 5800 mana and easily passed the next one.
---
That sounds bannable.
---
You get help for that if you are a guild tool
---
It's real simple. Can NPCs get to you on the roof? If the answer is no, it's cheating  and you know it.
---
You clearly have no understandings of the phrase  carebear, nice try tho haha
---
It's not against the rules to be up on the roof. Just against the rules to pvp on the roof as the guards get hung up and can't attack you.
---
This rule was removed in BC when flying mounts were introduced even in areas where guards could not attack you.
---
It's Classic, so they are going back to the classic way of dealing with it. A warning is fair enough. I'm glad GMs are actually showing themselves in some instances like they did back in Vanilla. Brings back memories of GM encounters my group ran into!
---
In pve yes, pvp no.
---
I feel like this is when I was a kid at the pool and a life-guard would yell at me to stop running.
---
You dont. My buddy just logs off in spirit form outside BRD because he can just rez and walk in when he finds a group, as opposed to get sniped at the flightmaster and having to rez hop all the way to the instance. He does looks for groups and does trades on his alt character.
---
^This
---
Bring a druid friend. Have him buff you both with Thorns. Make the druid friend stand at the cave entrance and do NOTHING. You 1) cure the infected peasants and 2) heal them with FoH (can’t remember rank) and Renew (rank6?) 3) if some mobs for some reason get to you, use Holy Nova rank 4.
---
I was super nervous about the quest myself aswell, guildie told me to do it like this and surprisingly there was absolutely nothing challenging about the whole quest.
---
"Should" is the yardstick by which you measure the current state of affair. We're really far away from what Classic should have been at this point. There very much is a point in discussing it, because it prevents corporate apologists from parading out the current state as something good. The current state of Classic is. not. good. It doesn't matter if this is the only Classic we'll ever get. People without standards who will blindly accept anything have no authority to speak on behalf of people who wanted Blizzard to put more than just the bare basic amount of effort into this project.
---
[well, its exceedingly simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE0ne430gbA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=39)
---
Theres a youtube video where this guy talks about back in vanilla when he got into an argument with a GM about ganking from the roof in darkshire. Since there is no wall-clipping being exploited to get on the roof the GM finally agreed that it was not a bannable offense left him alone. He also said the GM logged into a level 60 alt and jumped up there &amp; killed him so I guess thats how we’ll have to deal with it if no wall-clipping is being exploited
---
And a lot of these people will fail to get rank 11+ despite grinding away all their free time and will burn out. The smarter ones ought to realize it soon. As for the rest, good riddance.
---
No it doesn't.  Make a new tab, go to settings for it and check anything you want to show.  You are complaining about something you don't even understand.
---
They could have been doing this before Phase 2.
---
Agreed here. Doing ubrs and I love having hunters and feral druids. Feral druids are incredibly handy.
---
Shadow priests are hit and miss they are either great or a pain in the ass. Tanking and having them straight up mind blast is a pain. I'm a pretty tolerant tank but not going to lie. If they do that at the start I'll consider letting them die.
---
That's awesome man! Unfortunately I only have 1 character and he's level 50 so I dont have that much time to spend leveling so I would rather not die every couple minutes and go to a server that's a bit more balanced
---
The is a massive amount of math going on behind the scenes on those numbers. You can look at spell coefficients if you want to really know but it isn't worth it considering other people have worked out the percentages already.
---
Sure, it is what it is, and is and has been the nature of wow pvp at least in vanilla/classic for as long as it’s been around. But “just get good” is still not a reasonable response when most people  should know that there’s a time commitment that a lot of the folks worried about getting camped Etc, at this point, clearly aren’t able to make.  
---
My point is more that telling people that as if they don’t know there’s a time commitment ignores the fact that a lot of this dynamic between casuals and hardcores is a matter of people who can’t commit the time to the game still wanting to enjoy it, just like the hardcores want to enjoy it. 
---
Sure, a lot of casuals are being, on the surface, unreasonably frustrated. But the hardcore folks are acting like these folks are wholly ignorant to the circumstances when, really, it’s just wanting to enjoy facets of the game that they love, but they’re locked out of because the gap between hardcore and casual is feeling starker than it ever did, and a lot of people who returned to this game probably don’t even have the option to be hardcore enough anymore. It’s not wrong, just an unempathetic response that honestly doesn’t help anyone involved. 
---
That said, the casuals complaining despite the fact that, deep down, they have to know their frustration comes from having other priorities, are wasting people’s time/breath as well. It’s just a stupid back and forth that is getting tiresome to hear and I’m just hoping that saying this kind of shit may make someone on either side cool it lol.
---
One of those things that everyone's using now so you need to either jump on the wagon or play pve. Blizzard obviously isn't taking "level playing field" seriously this go around.
---
in writing means more than just in letters.... where is it posted... or viewable by players.
---
Charming lad
---
So basically camping some inside rooms with lots of LoS opportunities by melee classes is bannable as well because mages didn't have enough room to outrange them? /s
---
Getting a hold of a strategic point is not fair, it's tactical. World isn't about fair fights, if you want a fair fight you can duel or play an arena. In world it's about using the surroundings, outnumbering your enemy, attacking them when they're weak or focused on something else... 
---
You can be a "fair knight" and always announce you're coming, wait for them to drink and prepare and only then fight them if you want. But it's for sure not the only way to do it. This is war. Not a shiny tournament.
---
&gt; It's the combined damage on a target from your entire party/raid.
---
He couldn’t cut it in Vanilla so he rolled PvE in Classic.
---
Yeah, and then you can quickly /who someone who enters stealth, see if they're on your faction, quickly make a target macro for them, find an addon that also gives you their coordinates like spy does, and achieve all of the same things with 100 times the effort, per target by the way. 
---
It doesn't matter if it automates things that are ***technically*** possible. It makes it much more efficient than they ever were intended. Anyone pretending they're actually actively monitoring their combat log is being incredibly disingenuous to the point of not being worth conversing with. Even if someone were actually sitting there staring at their combat log their awareness should be rewarded. But they aren't.
---
You are absolutely 100% delusional if you think the overall split across all classic servers is 80:20.  Even the stupid wowhead census from back in September was damn near 50:50 for all U.S. servers.
---
You have to be trolling. I refuse to believe that you're this stupid.
---
Some people seems to think that you are eligible to need only items that are your actual pre raid (or even raid) bis items. I had really scrappy belt and juicy +44 healing green belt drops. I needed that and equipped it of course. People didn't like it and said I should go to farm DM because that's where my pre raid bis is. And greens should never be needed because they can be sold in AH. Made me think that people are just greedy.
---
I think if item is upgrade then you roll need for that, end of story. Naturally if BoE epic drops then everyone should need as we are usually talking about hundreds of golds, even if that BoE happens to be upgrade for someone.
---
Why is grom gol godsend? I assume zandalari buffs, but it is not in the game yet, or any other reason?
---
That 5 alliance guy should have to work together to beat the 1-2 horde raid at brd... ItS a pVp SeRvEr WoRk tOgEtHeR.
---
I think it's due to server population being orders of magnitude larger than it was back in vanilla. This is affecting a lot of areas of the game, mob grinding, gathering, etc.
---
30 minutes is low, took me more than an hour yesterday   Not only did they camp the boat, they camped FPs at theramore/menethil/thalanaar +the entire zone between east feralas and dire maul
---
First advice is don't panic, Blizzard bans are not written in stone like some automated VAC bans. You pay a subscription and they have employees for customer support ( they do use a lot of sampled texts to boost their response time, but there's always a way to get a real human to look at your case ). 
---
*Blizzard 3:16  - "  if account actions were imposed during an account compromise, we won't hold the account holder culpable and will do all we can to get the account back in the control of the rightful owner and revert any damages made during the incident. "*
---
So the first thing you can do is to find out if a strange foreign ip logged into your account, that would be the easiest way to get it back. Support can do that on demand.
---
If everything is normal, that means your character 100% received dirty gold one way or another. This is more tricky. You think you got banned because someone bought you items with dirty gold, that's the kind of problems that requires a human intervention. 
---
I think you should reply to the ticket or make another one. Describe clearly what you think is going on, ask for the ip check and don't forget to prove you're the rightful owner of the account ( put your phone number and attach a scan of your ID card ). If you still get automated responses, you can use phone or twitter. Type blizzard customer support &lt; your country &gt; on google and you will find easily
---
&gt;ait! Sucks losing 
---
This \^
---
My favorite part, in 15 years blizzard has done nothing to combat imbalanced realms which is much more important in a 1v1 scenario than Planetside in a 1v1v1 scenario. Blizzard is so inept
---
A bit late to the party but nugrunning lets you have a timer anchored on screen and show above nameplates at the same time.
---
Retail does have pve or pvp servers. Normal and rp with warmode setting
---
The best way I can spell it out:
---
Yes I expected to get ganked, yes I expected to get camped, but no, I did not expect level 60's (6 of them) to stomp my level 46 in circles for 45 minutes (the time it took me to kill 10 mobs because of the fact) at 10 a.m. server time on a week day. Wasnt for honor, it wasnt for revenge, it was just a waste of everyone's time, for 45 minutes.
---
Even levels? 1v1, 1v2? If you can manage to camp me for 45 min, I deserve it because I must be very bad. Want to gank me a few times? Why not. But when you're getting nothing out of it, and there are 6 of you, and it goes on for 45 minutes, well, it gets quite tiring.
---
all it does is watch the combat log, and register it to a window other than the combat log.
---
I’ve been playing on an RP pve server.  Horde side.  It’s very unbalanced, definitely in Alliance’s favor. 
---
I still find the community to be welcoming and helpful in general.  I’ve been having a blast!  In the past I’ve quit wow for long periods of time due to several factors but part of it had often been the general anger and hostility channeled in gen chat.  I hardly ever see that here though.  I think the population is small enough that trolls and/or ninjas get a bad reputation and then guilds won’t pick them up. 
---
I have started a couple alliance toons in same server but the chat’s often a bit more...aggressive maybe.  Not sure how to convey the feeling but I’m very happy horde side.
---
Big facts. Wait till pallys start getting their PvP trinkets, literally impossible to cc them at that point and they can just bomb huge heals all day lol.
---
Right, so you'd restrict transfers from PvE-&gt;PvP. (as it is now?) I can respect that.
---
I fucking miss DAoC, truly the greatest pvp mmo.
---
I think the reasoning would be fair enough for shamans who are drowning in spells and downranked versions of them. However a warrior only has maximum 1 1/2 pages of each tree. 
---
With shift and alt you really can get everything onto your keyboard comfortably. 
---
But I'm also playing with a MMO mouse which helps tremendously.
---
It was bannable to do this shit back in the day too.. sooooo
---
Given that you mention getting ganked upon landing in LHC, I’m assuming you’re ally since I’ve always been ganked there. I’d be surprised if Horde are having the same experience, they seem to have the numbers in Whitemane.
---
I have to agree, it’s really a curious phenomenon. I can run around all day looking for shit to get up to- most of the time is straight up wandering. Then you go to the typical traffic areas and there’s TONS of people- Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge are notorious for being a total shitshow, as are Felwood, Winterspring, Un’Goro, and Silithus. 
---
It would be one thing if there were people soloing, and occasionally there are- but most of the time, the major areas are either controlled or shut down completely by murder squads. So you have to either murder squad up to drive off the murder squad, or... get farmed? Party in Ironforge? Go to a lower level zone? Go run a dungeon?
---
I found some fights in Blasted Lands earlier, but that’s just not as much fun because there’s so many lower level players who can get caught as collateral / get pulled in to the fight. I have no clue what the answer is either- BGs will help but only because they’re going to move most players into instances. 
---
I’m kind of nervous that cross server BGs will end up torpedoing the PvP game for me- given that we are dealing with these allegedly ‘mega large’ server populations, I hope they’re able to figure out a matchmaking system that prioritize all same server games. If not completely kill off the cross server idea for the mega servers.
---
As long as you are not doing anything you can still do this
---
On that realm too, dm me and ill add you, unsure if we are the same level tho
---
May want to forward this to Blizzard Classic Team then
---
Dude holy shit.
---
"Important note: only players seen on Warcraft Logs are available!
---
Because of this, real distribution may not be accurate
---
You really can't make this shit up. Not only does it say it might not be accurate (which is enough, it doesn't matter why) it states because of WCL...you think level 20s are parsing their logs for Deadmines and Wailing Caverns? This at best is documenting high level players, which isn't really accurate of the community. 
---
WoW census shows Alliance is the over played faction.
---
Phase 2 is bullshit, pure griefing phase, they should add BGs and remove rewards for open PvP.
---
People get rewards for killing someone 12 levels below them, this is the worst PvP game I‘ve ever seen, the only reason why WoW servers are split into PvP and PvE, it wouldn’t be necessary, if they designed it better.
---
https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8845-November-12-Hotfixes-Korrak%E2%80%99s-Revenge-and-Classic-Updates?page=1 Nov 12th hotfix notes.
---
&gt; Developers’ note: We’re seeing some players attack others by abusing line-of-sight rules in Gadgetzan. This disruption is against our Terms of Service (as it was in 2006) and we’re taking action against players who exploit this game mechanic. While this new range differs slightly from original WoW 1.12, it better enforces the authentically intended consequence of PvPing in a goblin city by challenging the attacker to fight, die, or escape the guards.
---
It's worth noting I was only ever healing instances and had/rolled on primarily healer gear. BRD was never an issue, quite a breeze with a competent group.
---
If you don't want people to look at your talents you can take off details, but there's almost no way for them to tell you're shadow unless you explain why you can't give spirit buff.
---
Laughs in mage
---
If the alliance didn't exploit it to hell to begin with, horde wouldn't have even know it existed. It all starts when someone tries to find an advantage. Don't hate the player, hate the game, fool. It's not the hordes fault that alliance have a tactically advantageous position in their major pvp town. You act like it doesn't serve to benefit your faction, just like AV no doubt, and yet it's utilized by alliance on every server. It isn't difficult to check, go verify. 
---
How gross it is that when the positions are turned, the Alliance find the tactics to be unethical. Cry cry cry, whines the little bitch Ally. Don't get your way, send the GMs in to save the day. Fuck you.
---
Depends, it was designed so hordes defense is up near ice blood graveyard so if the horde forces camp that its insanely hard for alliance to push through. Alliances defense is strongest in their final base.
---
Sounds like it was a group of friends that wanted to scapegoat the outsider.  
---
I would have asked why he wasn't asking the main tank these things, since he's considered the main tank.
---
This would be much more useful as I will stock up on Pots in bulk then just go to a bank to refill.
---
No changes resulted in over populated servers how?
---
uh no
---
Wish I could remember what 10-12 yr old me remembered lol
---
true this is a positive
---
Horde on Kurinaxx by chance?
---
Also I agree, you should EASILY get off two blizzards before you nova. Try taking a step back for a half second in between
---
Not possible
---
not possible
---
That may have been because no shoes can be seen as racist? People spam cross server shit all the time. And always have.
---
Well of course &lt;literally any alternative&gt; will work to reduce the amount of people participating in &lt;the only option&gt;
---
The problem is BGs are incentivized while WPVP isn't, thus forcing people into BGs.
---
Until you realize its about a video game. You can list off some amazing "features" of wall hacks in an FPS, doesn't make it appealing.
---
The Spy addon sounds really lame.
---
My favorite alliance town is menethil Harbor. Theres literally a clear line of site to the flight path that mages can sit by the water and pick off afkers for free honor.. if you try and chase them they just blink across the water. Such shitty design.
---
You don't need a lot of Honor. You just need the most Honor on your server. If somehow your server is completely full of casual scrubs then you don't have to farm as much Honor.
---
Maybe. But there are a ton of well known aggro-reset ledge bugs across the game that people seem to exploit without consequence as long as they’re not being used to grief other players (see: warlocks solo farming Sunken Temple for the shadowrath offhand).
---
Its an Algebra mistake : )  
---
Most errors in Calculus aren't the theorems, its the simple Algebra that gets ya.  
---
Ok fun fact over.
---
with paid transfers you can also transfer form PvP to PvE but not the other way around
---
#No Changes tho
---
Sixtyupgrades saves data client side, so i don't think you can share a link to your toon.
---
How can you argue that its OK to camp on this roof in the literal topic where a GM warns people to get off of THAT roof?
---
Are you just purposely antagonistic?
---
Yep that's the irony in this entire thread. I will bet a million dollars that most of the low level players who complain that 60s aren't inviting them to their group will have the EXACT same mentality when they themselves are lvl 60 and have run strat 20 times and don't have the patience to bring a low level player that does shitty dps and pulls everything and makes everything take longer.
---
But it's easy to be on a high horse when it doesn't cost you anything.
---
Alliance and a victim complex what’s new
---
I know exactly which video you're talking about.
---
Yeah, but you can have countermeasures. It's not like warlocks appear from stealth. Soon everyone will have a PvP trinket, and shadow reflectors are already available. There are also restoration potions, if you feel like throwing gold to beat warlocks.
---
Being undead is absolutrly not a requirement to beat locks.
---

“And that kids is how I met your mother”
---
Ah the greatest
---
I had always played on a pvp server prior to classic. 
---
Hadn’t played in quite a while though.  Thought I’d try pve.  It’s been great.  With phase 2 we have ole ty of large scale battles going on that I can join in on.  Or I can opt to not join.
---
You don't have to.  You can color the name so you know if it's friendly or not.  Go complain that people can use mouseover macros instead of actually clicking on someone.  
---
&gt;  The fact of the matter is it's too difficult for blizzard to break so people better get used to it.
---
It's not hard.  There isn't any reason to though.  Carbonite had this sort of thing ten years ago, at least.  It's been pointed out many times which you plainly ignore that there were addons that did this in Vanilla.
---
But please tell me more how the game is broken by things you don't understand.
---
sigh... that was my point. Ofc classic videos have it, just about everyone is using it atm.  
---
Its really widespread, and it was NOT widespread in vanilla, as some are trying to make an argument about.
---
Problem, a lot of what you said also isn't right. People always go 'it took forever to level in classic!' Not really. It wasn't THAT much slower than now tbh, the problem is you think the population started in one huge chunk and then dwindled. No it did not. People came LATER, not on initial release.
---
70/30 didn't happen until well after the transfers started according to the census data before the census add-on was killed. Skeram started out 55/45 early on.
---
There goes the sniper class
---
Hud* :-)
---
Really?
---
Yeah but rogues don't get anything from golemlord. I mean healers are just selfish people.
---
Spy does let you target them- then warlocks / hunters can sic their pet on them or priests can mind vision.
---
There’s unfortunately plenty of ways around it not technically giving the pursuer their victim’s location.
---
At 54 you can quest in WPL, Ferelas, and even a bit in Winterspring.
---
How would you so this?
---
I thought whenever I MC someone all control swapped to that character and I no longer have control of myself in order to target and buff that character.
---
The client they use to appear chooses a random race class combination.  Just happened to land on troll.
---
Mushroom gang 💪🤣
---
This is exactly right. People have no idea the time investment to even finish their blue set (rank 10). On pservers its usually around 500-600k honor (with wsg out) to barely plateau at 10.  Bracket 1 for rank 14s is always in the 1.2-1.6 million. Hell, when China was trying to fight for extra br1 slots they ended up pushing honor to 2.1 mill one week. People have no clue what they’re getting into. 
---
One way I like to phrase it for people new to vanilla is like this. Bracket for with no bgs feels like 150-200k, 250k on super competetive servers. Now imagine on the day of classic launch you had all preraid, banks of raid mats, gold and everything good to go. If you pushed 200k honor every single week since launch, you would still not be rank 14. If you pushed only 120k honor a week, you would probably plateau at 11 by now.
---
Cool, I'm gonna roll on all your shit then... vendors for a few gold a piece and it's such bullshit that you get priority on it "because I can use it!".
---
Oh wait that's a really stupid attitude isn't it? 
---
But you do you mate. My "bullshit attitude" has gotten me a massive list of awesome people to play with and have an amazing time with, so you go right ahead and play however you want. Just don't do it with me.
---
I will refrain from correcting your spelling, your math knowledge is probably greater than mine. I can here to comment, yet leave having learned something!
---
Beautifully placed in the middle of the zone with a zeppelin straight to the capital. AFAIK allys dont even have a base in StV.
---
If you're horde you don't even really have to engage with anyone till level 30! No joke, horde have it so fucking easy in comparison with barrens being available. Barrens vs redridge, there's a huge disparity in levelling safety.
---
I like that you got downvoted. For all the Alliance crying about Horde being the dominant faction: https://wowclassicpopulation.com/
---
The problem is you turn tail instead of fighting.
---
Not only the queue but they also gave the lesser faction xp bonuses to promote balance.
---
&gt;You are absolutely 100% delusional   and in need of a huge fucking reality check if you think the overall split across all classic servers is anywhere near 80:20 
---
You are absolutely 100% blind and in need of an a visit to your eye doctor because you apparently can't actually read what I typed.
---
You do get that but in other parts of the game. 
---
PvP for a day in front of OG. Sit in BS at the flightmaster or invite people into your roaming death squad in WPL around Sorrow Hill and Chillwind and you will meet the same people over and over.
---
Just yesterday I was dueling in Kargath and after an hour a priest came along who was in the same 5 man group as I the day before in WPL.
---
Yeah it's pretty much the absolute worst solo class.
---
In vanilla they werent battlegroups. At least not always.
---
is in the TOS under terrain exploiting. This is not a new loophole you kids just found. We used to do it in vanilla and GMs used to hand out "vacations" back then too
---
The emperor protects
---
Dont listen to the conspiracy theorists, its simple really. More people play Horde in retail most classic players are ex retail players, people want to play the same faction as they do in retail. Boom. That and Horde is cooler.
---
I see the point about the guards, and that should be fixed by code. The argument about LOS:ing players is just stupid. They can run away, or they can run up there themselves. It's simply a strategical advantage like any other.
---
Unpopular opinion: I think women are beautiful and I love boobs
---
What a vintage meme. A meme from the time before memes were not even known as memes yet :)
---
Gearmaxxed level 60 horde, lol 
---
I'm sorry but you would not be having fun landing at a flight path and just corpse running the whole time. How anyone thinks that is a good time for the minority of the community is missing a few brain cells. 
---
Separating the honor system as Blizzard have done will drastically reduce the number of subs and kill a lot of imbalanced servers
---
At least someone got it lol
---
Wind fury works in extremes, either the fastest or slowest weapon you can get. 
---
A fast weapon will give you more wf procs and more uptime on flurry. 
---
A slow weapon has the big wf crits and flurry and the 10% weapon damage talent will have more effect. (25% faster swings on a 4sec swing time is a big deal)
---
SS is fun, but Nature swiftness is the way to go.  
---
Do the 0/30/21 build.
---
There is also an auctioneer by the bottom level armor room, where a lotta people go right off that boat to repair.
---
What's simple is that you don't play the game by your own admission and as a result you need to :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhkNLHictW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhkNLHictW8)
---
You realize the original post is about the influence the ranking rewards have on the outdoor PvP and that it's such a clusterfuck because the rewards are available too early. The actual percentage of people who actually end up getting R14 weapons is **completely irrelevant**.
---
Unless it is their personal blacklist.
---
So you're just bitching about something you know next to nothing about? Reddit culture, srsy...
---
It comes down to Alliance racials and dwarf priests being really really good for raid encounters. Horde Encounters are pvp focussed, and that's why everyone thinks they're favored in pvp. But while shaman and paladin are about equaly good in pve, the paladin is the best healer in pvp. It's not as unfair as people claim it is.
---
You’re about to learn your place
---
My guy this is like me going into a soccer subreddit and going "You fucking dipshits, pick up the ball it'll be so much easier to move and get around others!" 
---
You don't know context, rules, or anything to do with the game, why even bother commenting?
---
Thrash is a terrible OH due to the weapon speed. If anything thrash MH and MS OH
---
it's a game. it's meant to be fun not realistic
---
the mental high ground of playing as the underdog is evergreen
---
No one is going to really 'pull away' in progression on pve content. It will be steamrolled by both sides. Remember that the first two guilds to do Naxx 40 were decided by the server rest and were horde and alliance respectively.
---
Is it easy to get to Rend fast?
---
Angerforge is a quick farm (with my rogue, I can unlock the doors AND the mechanism in that room without aggroing anything), my groups don't need to kill more than a few groups before we're staring at him.
---
Is Rend also a fast run (I've never done UBRS or LBRS)?
---
Git gud.
---
battlegroups were introduced in 1.12
---
People being told to reroll because the game is unplayable also have to give up their characters and their friends. But for some reason that is completely ok according to a lot of people in this subreddit. 
---
Adding queues to combat balance issues? Gods no we can't do that!
---
Exactly. This thread is about why they didn't fix the ability to get up there. And it's because **nochanges**
---
But Alliance seems to have the overall. Solution: you guys need to reroll.
---
ANY terrain, regardless of location that prevents a guard response falls under the rule. It doesn't matter which inn roof since the guard can't get up on top of ANY inns.
---
True, but alliance has better major city location for molten core / bwl. Night elves with shadow meld are very good for 1 vs 1 world pvp and paladin engineers are insane in 40 vs 40 action.
---
they didn't ban it. I still use it to this day lol
---
Install the addon and help out.
---
Hey. Fellow orc fury here. Raid leader and one of the top dps in our guild.
---
You should always have windfury when raiding. This is what makes 2 hand viable.
---
Your goals getting on the way to 60 if you want to raid as 2H should be to get:
---
1. Dreadforge Retaliator with crusader
---
2. HoJ and Savage Gladiator’s Chain from Arena/Anger runs
---
3. Devilsaur Set 
---
4. Mining to 300 and start farming for Lionheart Helm.
---
At 60 all you need is then 6% hit. So you prioritise the BiS gear that gives hit until you have 6% then whatever you can get with Str/AP/Crit for the rest.
---
I got a Spinal Reaper on Sunday after 6 weeks of no 2 hander drops. Can’t wait to see how much I can do next week (fingers cross I’m not threat capped).
---
Literal fake news
---
I would look at your main tanks gear. Are they going full mitigation? Do they have +hit/+weapon skill (and are they human or orc)? What is their weapon/shield like? If they're in full mitigation gear, or maybe wearing fire resist for baron geddon, they might miss some crucial skills at the beginning, which is where the "wait for sunders" came from. If they get a big crit shield slam early on they'll be locked in for threat for a bit. These bosses don't hit hard so there isn't much reason to go full mitigation at this point, so hopefully your tank has some hit and you can go in a bit sooner.
---
People who do those things hardly contain themselves enough to not say something to compound their actions and get them in trouble though. I have heard of people getting banned for it because it's targeted harrassment.
---
Maybe for rogues. It is good to have a slow oh for warrior because it means your oh will eat up fewer flurries. Also, thrash blade oh makes you swing extra with your mh on proc.
---
He said “when I was leveling up,” meaning he probably fully leveled before honor dropped
---
Ka' du kom ne' derfra!
---
atm you stack +heal. Crit only comes into play in AQ40/Naxx content. Now if you try to stack it you're either reliant on world buffs or you'll be to rng dependand.
---
&gt; fair fight
---
All's fair in love and war[craft]
---
It's not evade they just don't aggro at all , you're out of range.
---
Damn, having access to both Auction Houses is OP
---
Yea exactly, PVPing on a rooftop is fine unless you're exploiting to avoid the guard mechanic. LOS has nothing to do with it. Lol imagine someone LOSing behind a wall and reporting him for "exploiting"
---
The utility is probably just less needed whrn there are so many people that cover like everything.
---
im a lvl 22 rogue and for some reason its not lettin me train my crippling poison spell even tho it says lvl 20. what am i doing wrong?
---
But that's what I'm saying it is walkable it's just out of range of the guards
---
imagine trying to get meta comp for a vanilla dungeon lmao. how much do you have to struggle with the single mechanic per dungeon.
---
It's nice your balanced on Fairbanks it's so offset its ridiculous. The other night I got killed by a horde raid group looked like 20 to 30 people just sat there riding circles around my body waiting for me to spawn and I was only level 45. It looked like a scene from world war z.
---
A rogue tried to gank me with a two level advantage and while I was missing some HP.
---
Problem: I'm a warrior with a ton of Rage pooled just for this kind of situation between mob pulls. Disarmed him and started wailing into her. Human rogue pops evasion, forgetting overpower exists. They ate a crit, tried to heal with a potion, but the overpowers kept happening since they kept dodging. Then they went down like a brick in water.
---
Felt pretty good, especially since they started the fight thinking I'd be an easy target.
---
It's such a joke that guards at Menethil are lvl40s while the goblin guards on zeppelin towers in Org and UC are lvl55s who can prevent half of the Ally raids from even getting off the zeppelin with their perma-knockbacks. There has been a few rogues randomly killing people in Menethil on my server every day since Thursday and we don't stick around long enough to prevent them from coming back since camping 3 people with a team of 12 isn't very efficient for honor. It should've been the guards duty, not us.
---
Ya. I forgot when, but I remember being server only BGs for a while.
---
&gt; Incorrect. Terrain exploiting is defined by the terms of service blip and blue post as going anywhere the guards can not follow. ALL rooftops fall under this heading.
---
Yeah they just don't aggro , they could if they were in range. It's not like there's no pathing to it
---
Why shouldnt you? Grab yourself a tank and reserve orbs. This way neither the healer nor the tank is hit or miss and you can blaze through strat:live in 35min runs dropping 1 to 7 orbs. Big money incoming.
---
Mainly to have the mob be at the starting position and thus for enough away from the actual battle to not be accidentially targeted or hit by AoE. Otherwise you will often have to poly within the group which breaks more easily.
---
(Not the guy you're replying to) I don't play on PvP servers, but can you get unflagged at high levels in Horde territory? I always assumed at a certain level the flag remains permanently on.
---
While crappy, this is actually not against the ToS (or rather, not enforced)
---
Isn't blue pvp gear released in like phase 6?
---
I can't give any numbers since, afaik Blizzard hasn't released any. 
---
However, on EU there are 18 PvP servers and 7 of them are full, 7 are high pop, 4 medium pop.
---
There are 3 PvE realms. 2 full and 1 high pop. 
---
Maybe "very small" was too rough but there's certainly a lot smaller total population of players playing on PvE realms compared to PvP realms.
---
Wait where the blue gm robes not in vanilla?
---
God you're lazy as shit, here I'll do the super hard lengthy google work for you.  
---
[http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/2336291.htm](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/2336291.htm)   
---
Now find the door to this thread and fuck off.
---
Just get up too and kill them. If it is accessible you have all the right to get there. This is not exploiting, this is standing on another thing thats added in this game, not different from a gravestone, fence, tree, hill or whatever else.
---
Imagine gatekeeping classic dungeons
---
I’ve cleared all end game dungeons mostly with people who were sub 60. I started them at around 55-56 when I had the dungeon quests for them and wanted to get some pre bis while I was at it.
---
Yes some dungeons can be made much easier with certain classes, but they Certainly don’t require you to be 60.
---
I’d take a 55 mage to scholomance for that sweet decurse, int buff and amazing AoE that makes that annoying exploding corpse trash easier to deal with.
---
Well hot damn
---
Fair enough, wouldn't have taken a potshot at you otherwise, but I am sure this happens even though the odds are against you - and it's essentially what OP's post is about. Both sides will attack when given a reasonable chance, most of the time.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
First off, Spy is just the re-made addon Paranoia, which was available in Vanilla. So to answer your "worry about longetivity", that addon caused WoW to last at least 15 years, spawning several expansion, including a revival of Vanilla called Classic, growing a huge fan base up until Wotlk. 
---
Put simply, there's no problem even though you want to insist there is one.
---
For BGs the information that yes, there are enemies around is very useful of course as is the fact that someone stealthed somewhere. Doh.
---
You either have no actual clue what it does and how it works and just assume things, or you deliberately misrepresent things to further your goals:
---
For example, in BGs your combat log will span the entire BG. Someone stealthing is 0 information to you \*where\* that happens except you are seeing the player in question stealthing at which point it is: 0 additional information for you.
---
You cannot target stealthed players either. You never could and you never will be able to.
---
Finally, let me close in saying that Spy is not even that well known and popular, especially if you compare the total downloads to say Questie classic. However in the last few days it has gotten a lot more downloads, thanks to threads like yours. All you do is make it more popular by making the umpteenth thread about it while regurgitating points from other people and not really knowing what it does (and definitely not knowing what happens in BGs as apparently you never played them in Vanilla. I did. It's fine).
---
I use it and I agree I wish it didn't exist. I don't want it around.
---
Here's one from a couple days ago too
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/23164374/hotfixes-november-13-2019
---
They talk about the goblin cities, but the idea is the same (terrain safespotting from guards)
---
Ahh yes, the crybaby mod strikes back! Keep up the terrible work of using your online power, your parents are proud!
---
**WARCRIMES**
---
Click the link to the supposed blizzpost on that site. It literally doesn't exist. Making stuff up to convine people is the hot new thing I guess.
---
Some players were popping sapper charges on me in 1v1 fights around BRM on Thursday, that was when I realized the mayhem will not be sustainable.
---
And I absolutely agree that BGs will be a lot more fun than the vast majority of current WPvP encounters. My experience with it has been either wiping other people or be wiped, which loses its novelty very quickly. Having teams of equal sizes compete against each other is endless content in itself. It's basically what made MOBA games so popular.
---
Agreed. Whenever I see this I usually hit pyroblast to break sap or poly.
---
A reset is an evade. Is that disallowed? Its not in any way shape or form different then kiting shit away to reset it.
---
Then why not be on the ground right next to it? No difference if so.
---
I think you should play retail, crybaby.
---
I'm pretty sure you can, you just need to stay away from pvp for 5 minutes and then you can right click on your portrait and unflag yourself. At least I never heard there being any level restriction to that.
---
I think 9x gorosh in 100 runs is pretty lucky though. But 9 kills with no chest sucks big time. Had the chest dropped on my 4th gorosh.
---
Not really an exploit unless they’re doing something like hacking the game or something. If they can get there so can you.
---
I don't see you either so I guess you're made up too by that logic.
---
&gt;They can also get on the roof to do something about it, its not like he teleported up there, if he can get up there, so can others.
---
It's difficult enough to get up there without someone trying to kill you. It usually takes a few minutes of abusing the terrain.
---
Hey, congratz. Must feel great to get a World Boss down, hoping to get a kill aswell
---
wha wha wha is all I hear every time you post.
---
Should b a ban but its blizzard so they will pry ban you for reporting
---
Oh, ty for the clarification, I’m fairly new to classic and was going off of the mage talent Frostbite.
---
So using scripts to find out if someone is near you isnt exploiting, whereas getting to a place you can jump to is? You are weird.
---
AMEN!
---
Thorium brotherhood....more like Thorium...NOTBrotherhood amirite?!
---
and people say nowadays players are way better at the game than 15 years ago, lmao.
---
You fucka with me, I fucka with you
---
I got rekt with a 3 day ban xD
---
&gt; It has been mostly great up until this phase and now its polarising.
---
Because it finally shows who actually asked for Classic and who are the bandwagoners coming from retail.
---
Breaking TOS how?
---
There are many easy to get chests with 2% crit, one from DM and one from BRD aswell. The SGC has better raw stats, that's why you want it.
---
Thank you for adding that obe, but chances are redman will ignore it because it doesn't agree with him.
---
hes a warlock so yeah probably
---
https://youtu.be/YUndqiEJj6Y
---
Any questions let me know
---
Think about how often the TOS has changed and cry yourself to sleep
---
Taunt after each wrath cast regardless of if the tank resisted or not.
---
Is there a difference between the roofs that are accessible without exploit vs those that are only with?
---
You get flagged in WPL and most of the quests are from the bulwark.
---
Lost me at "To sides to this coin"
---
Apparently you can't read either since nothing you wrote looks like a response to my evidence that the overall population is closer to 50:50 than you thought.
---
You know, latest estimate for Heartseeker is 52.9% Alliance 47.1% Horde.
---
Skeram is 28.2% Alliance and 71.8% Horde.
---
Not sure if quite in the same league tbh...
---
because warlocks pull aggro by breathing

5 days old... you can show yourself out now.
---
The key is, that the basic spam spell for paladins is rank 1 flash of light, which is a level 20 spell, so gets no downranking penalty and only costs 35 mana in the first place. With good healing gear, rank 1 fol heals around 400-500 right now and 800-900 with endgame gear.
---
Dead meme is dead.
---
&gt; At least I never heard there being any level restriction to that but I suppose I could be wrong.
---
There might not be, I don't play PvP servers and have zero clue on how it works. It's all pure guesswork on my end :p

I see Y O U R AS O U R B O O M E R quite a lot and I rather enjoy the creativity.

I spit on everyone, some I even teabag.

Encourage you guys to kill me on site, hope that helps:]

It's information from your combat log lmao. All you're doing is parsing it, same as details, and WeakAura 2. In fact, you can make Spy-lite using WeakAura 2.

I think it's always polite to reply back to people if you fill a group just to let them know

I want to play the game, but I want to do a dungeon run in an hour total (grouping up, travel, and dungeon) or so, not twice that, and then I want to go do another dungeon or maybe do some pvp. I get that lower levels need dungeon runs too, but they can do when we did when we were sub-60 and group together with other level 57-59's and hit the dungeons.
---
Not saying I never bring lower levels to dungeon runs, because I do, but if I have the chance for a 60 stacked run I'm going to take it.
---
&gt;Here's one from a couple days ago too

&gt;Developers’ note: We’re seeing some players attack others by abusing line-of-sight rules in Gadgetzan. This disruption is against our Terms of Service (as it was in 2006) and we’re taking action against players who exploit this game mechanic. While this new range differs slightly from orginal WoW 1.12, it better enforces the authentically intended consequence of PvPing in a goblin city by challenging the attacker to fight, die, or escape the guards.  
---
&gt;They talk about the goblin cities, but the idea is the same (terrain safespotting from guards)
---
5 days old... show yourself out.
---
Ok, boomer.
---
Fucking lol I guess?

In p servers you could ask in world if any GMs were avail or quickly make a ticket via blizz's original ticket system. I never waiting more than 1 day for a reply. These servers ran on donations. Now I pay 15 a month and have to deal with the automated telephone version of in game support with 2-5 day wait for reply. Gg blizz
---
&gt; I don't know how people enjoy griefing so much. 
---
Because that's how people work, when there are no consequences to their actions. I've played other games where griefing can literally set you back weeks\months or even years with of progress (Ark official pvp, anyone?)
---
At least in wow, you can simply res and still have all your gear and money.
---
At first you might not grief, but then you get griefed, and griefed again and again...All of a sudden you find yourself griefing again, and again....
---
How is it griefing if game masters say it's acceptable?
---
Don't fall for the 1 week old account troll. Just ignore him and move along.
---
What op described
---
- he joins a group that imposes quite one sided loot rules and changes his mind not long after joining following some quick further consideration and says toodle oo chaps, best of luck with the run and suddenly IN COME THE BLACKLIST THREATS FROM THE BADDIES.
---
What may have happened, from a different perspective 
---
-op is part of the group from the start and is fully onboard and showing willing with the loot rules. It takes a long time to form the group and nav to BRM with some painful pvp deaths before getting to the instance. Tank instigates first pull, and upon seeing this, op demands a last minute change to loot rules and insta bails on the group when he's advised that that isn't really fair. The guys he left in the lurch are understandably miffed and inform him that they'll be telling they're other playing buddies to avoid him from now on.
---
The truth is somewhere in the middle, op you shouldn't change loot rules at the last min (make your mind up earlier).
---
Why don't they make you unable to cast targeted offensive spells from there, then?
---
You're absolutely clueless dude. I'm coming down WSG tunnel, you're around the corner. In vanilla? absolutely no way to know that. With Spy? I know who you are, your name, your class, etc. This is new information, you can huff and puff and say its fine but you will watch the playerbase DWINDLE over phase 2, come back for phase 3, only to quit permanently if this is still around. Enjoy.
---
I'm pretty sure buffs count as a self spell sort of thing in the combat log and do show up
---
Holy fuck dude can you not read
---
&gt;intended consequence of PvPing in a *goblin city* by
---
it's not unbalanced, it's pure exploiting
---
&gt;Transferring to a differen't server shouldn't be an issue
---
Let me tell you about Noggenfogger PvP EU - I play Alliance there, like another ~21% of the active population (according to Ironforge.pro), and Blizzard has decided to shut off free transfers off the server for the alliance side, due to the massive horde overpopulation - which in and off itself isn't a bad idea.
---
The problem is that the horde doesn't take the offer, since the server is of the size that it is. We're (uniroincally) fortunate enough to be one of the largest 'casual' servers in the EU, so there's very little of the Firemaw/Golemagg level of tryharding.
---
The unfortunate side of this, is that the Alliance really doesn't have an APES-like guild to meaningfully fight back against the horde - with the result being that the overwhelming horde majority has made the game unplayable.

You showed me a sketchy pagerank 1 site with a link to a post that almost certainly never existed. Then showed me a post specifying goblin guards saying they had the same policy in 2006.
---
you mean the "sandpaper"?
---
It's PREbis for hunters, replaced by t1 chest piece.
---
it's BiS for DPS warriors, until p5, first boss in AQ40.
---
I mean I have a massive problem with it, but it'll keep abusing it to HOPEFULLY convince people that it's a problem
---
Kirm?!
---
Stating obviously when it is neither obvious, nor an exploit. Also there are plenty cases where specific addons have been banned. Think classic LFG tool for instance. And terrain exploitation is exploitation if not everyone can get there. Jumping up a building is not exploitation. Using movement hacks etc IS exploitation.
---
I'm a rogue...
---
Which book is that?
---
It actually is when behavior turns into griefing (as in targetted on a single person preventing them from properly playing... as in this example)
---
Dunno about kill but its definitely damaging at this point
---
I have always played on pvp servers, since vanilla. I love it, problem is right now. If you arent part of the death ball thats running around on your server, you are going to have a bad time. 
---
Structured battles like Southshore vs Tarren mill is a shitload of fun but it doesnt end there, also leveling on a pvp server was great. Loads of 1v1s with some bigger battles in the mix. wasnt always fair but it wasnt..... greify to put it that way
---
The only way to mitigate the deathball honor farmers imo, is to drop BGs
---
Not everyone will agree, i get that. Not everyone wants to spend every waking moment zerging people and others do
---
BGs wont solve the problem entirely, i imagine blackrock mountain will still be a pvp haven but thats also fine. you sort of expect it and can prepare for it sometimes.
---
Isn't Skeram like 90/10 H:A? 
---
That's fucking pathetic that some Horde players still need to exploit (coming from somebody who plays Horde too).
---
about this guy in the pic. i was in ZF with him on ZT. i saw his name and said "i hope one day you find your Luthien." glad he did :) greetings Velyssa from &lt;Sketchy&gt;

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyheq5/does_anyone_know_the_cool_down_for_dr_on_honor/). 
---
Are these people normally awarded with extra DKP? Why can't the guild pay people gold if they do this instead?
---
I've seen streams where someone hands out fire protection potions for Ragnaros and each person trades 5g per potion. Do you mean people who use consumables to improve their performance, or people who bring lots of extra for everyone to use?
---
Well, they should have. That's exactly how it was in Vanilla. Why do you think they added the 'honorless target' status?
---
The “Oh shit” truly makes this post.
---
Playing on Venoxis-DE, no problems so far with my lvl 26 Warlock in Hillsbrad Foothills. Didn't get ganked so far. :)
---
If it's an upgrade, then they can roll for it all they want.
---
This reads like Spy would add players to the list it finds via humanoid tracking abilities on the minimap. For this to work, since addons can't access tracking dots, a player would need to mouse over the tracking dot first. It specifically states that _known_ players will be added to the list. The code also has a function called "ParseMinimapTooltip".
---
As for displaying enemies on the map for other Spy users, I assume this only works if the detection of an enemy player via minimap tracking dot tooltip succeeded. At that point, the mouse will be over the tracking dot to parse the tooltip, which will give you more or less accurate coordinates of that player, but only at that specific moment. There is no other way to retrieve another player's coordinates through the addon API.
---
It gets the X and Y map locations from targeting the player and then shares with the rest of the players with the app. So one of the players having Spy installed will have targeted the player at some point. If the player is stealth, and can't be targeted, it will only have the location the player was last targeted. So all it does is add a point on the minimap when it catches someone changing something that will show up in the combat log and is close enough to get targeted or able to be targeted. 
---
This is actually a pretty well-writen add on.
---
On some packs a polypull can be a good idea, but the premise is that the tank either will charge in when the mage starts casting or that the pull will be manageable otherwise and allow the tank to pick up the forward rushing mobs after poly is cast. If you have to heal the mage or anyone else who pulls after it's initiated, either the person pulling is not communicating with the tank or the tank is asleep. An example of where the former would be beneficial is the final pack of Orcs before you make your way into the final room with the last boss in LBRS - this pack has 2 casters, and if you don't CC / interrupt their cast they'll push out \~1.5k damage each in 2 GCDs. Having mage start polying (with prior communication of some sort) the one further away and having the tank charge in on the other caster when the poly cast begins can save a TON of damage. Still got to interrupt the non-sheeped one, but it's the best way to do it imo. An example for the latter can be polypulling Battle Mages in the 4-mob packs in Strat living, and just pick up the other mobs as they run toward the group. You really want to either focus down battle mages first and interrupt them, or poly them and deal with them after the other mobs have been dispatched. 
---
Bottom line is that the mage (or other puller) should not be taking extra damage in either of those scenarios, though.
---
Uhm no it wasn't like that in vanilla we didn't have 7k+ people on at the same time
---
I legit didnt know this wasnt allowed
---
That's all PvE. And honestly all PvE is kinda easy in classic, so why not pick racials for PvP?
---
They'll need an army of GMs to clean up Grob. Shithole of cheaters all over.
---
My guild wiped a couple times on Onyxia yesterday- we split into 20 man teams for the first time and both teams took ~three attempts to get the kill. So hey, we wiped on an easy boss and got double loot for our effort. That's a win in my book!
---
I am actually Horde, should have mentioned, as I know for many hours of the day (including very late at night, as a lot of players out of Korea like me, and a TON of players out of Taiwan in SMOrc) are active late nights.
---
On Whitemane most people say it's 55/45 give or take. Alliance does own LHC for example a pretty significant amount of the time. I've created and left quite a few corpses there this week. It's cyclical, in which some Alliance get ganked at the flight path a few times, likely say in General how many Horde are there and then a group will roll through and win over the town and just start a massacre. It goes back and forth. I will say that yeah it does seem like more solo Alliance players get got there than Horde, but they are generally pretty fast at putting together a kill squad and then just running the zone for an hour or two before people leave and the cycle begins again.
---
What you said about the murder squads is absolutely correct. It's dangerous to be out alone now. I grabbed 2 buddies and our goal was to go herb, mine, kill stuff, and kill anyone we see while out. But we get bored to death not finding a single person and just end up logging off.
---
Very interesting phenomena like you said for such a populated server. I assume it's the same or even worse everywhere else, as I am lucky to just be on a megapop, being very stubborn about our group not leaving during release.
---
How did a paladin mind control you?
---
Ah a fellow Firemaw horde player!

MY SeRvER iS WoRsE ThAn Ur SeRvEr

You will be SO glad you did it, you'll be able to pull off ridiculous moves you never could before.  Of course it's kinda hard at first when you're changing over.   Could just swap one or two skills at a time and do a transition that way.
---
100% a bannable offense. He's griefing players and preventing them from progressing in the game. It's one thing to kill the opposite faction, but to park an alt in a location on a timer to grief players is a whole other issue.
---
Just started my warrior after getting my main mage to 60 and then leveling a paladin to 60 and thinking lol what could be worse than a paladin. Man.. at least Paladins can heal and I took that luxury for granted D:
---
I used 1 stun nade, 1 heavy linen bandage. I didn’t use a health pot because it was like 1% health and I was like 40%ish? MISS MISS DODGE (overpower proc) MISS PARRY..... I died :(

Shoutout to all the passerby’s who buff me/throw me a heal, you the real mvps.

As a hunter, I would never, ever, even consider taking this over a dps warrior.
---
I'd ask if the warrior if they intend to go tank or dps, if they're going tank I'll roll, if dps, no fuckin' way.

Pretty sure that's why he's here, asking for advice on how to get better. And not look like a fool

---
It's a practice thing, keep trying. Don't spam AE unless you know its a finishing move. You can also bring cheap mana pots for some extra mana gain and use mana gems, obviously. You can practice with less hard hitting mobs outside in the open or with lashers in dme. When I first tried ZG i couldn't finish a single run. After some practice it'll get really easy and you'll barely get hit at all.
---
...? They're talking about playing on a different server with a new character. That legitimately has nothing to do with retail and it's warmode mechanic and shards..
---
This is an awesome shot!!
---
What about a pvp server with a level 10 cap on it
---
Having been there from the start as well and having looked at the census data that was available within the first few weeks, I can say with certainty that Skeram, like Stalagg, have been terribly balanced from the start with, at the very least, a 65/35 - 70/30 balance before transfers happened.
---
My guild was actually halfway through transferring before they shut the service down for Alliance too... Lot's of unhappy people as soon as that happened.
---
Phase 2 is already ruined by having 3-5 times the server population compared to vanilla crammed into too small areas. Nochanges my ass
---
You can whiteknight blizz as much as you want but the p2 may killed the unbalanced servers. Since p2 I see a lot of questions from lvl1s on my server where alliance players want to reroll there to be able to play because their servers are like 70-30 or similar and its unplayable.  The fact that you try to suppress this problem with saying "b-but the a-alliance does it t-too yesterday I got ganked once too a-after 5 hours!!" Will just make it even worse.
---
&gt; This game is about the journey, not the destination, have we forgotten??
---
Dont you dare tell me how the fuck i wanna play my game though
---
Each Rend run takes 20-30 minutes. The slow part is the Rend event. The mobs spawn in timed intervals so even if you're fast, you end up sitting there waiting for the next group.
---
Neat pic but how the hell is a lock the last person left in her threat table? I bring limited invulnerability pots as a lock specifically because I know I’m probably gonna pull aggro during the phase 3 transition
---
The argument I've seen for it is it enables the tank being able to charge for rage while still pulling back for safety.
---
It is obvious, actually - one gets you banned if you persist in doing it, one does not. Which is an exploit?
---
Yes, specific add ons have been banned, but spy has not, so it's pretty clear that blizzard don't consider this as an addon which is exploitative.
---
Terrain exploitation is an exploit if not everyone can get up there - jumping on that building is an exploit because the town guards can't get there.
---
Is this an exploit? 
---
Yes, as defined by blizzard in their recent blue post on exploiting Town guards pathing.
---
In Classic low lvl pvp is an option to esp pre Battlegrounds. I clearly remember this when I first reached 40 they introdouced a competition alongside the honor system. The majoroty of player was around lvl 40 and above. We had alot of fun in the low lvl zones esp allys comming from Ashenvale to Barrens or ganking in groups outside Ratchet in Barrens. Hillsbrad foothills was crowded aswell with people ranging from anywhere between lvl 30-60.
---
I went one step further when farming that for my friend. Do the quest from the succubus in the bar so you can open the grim guzzler door and add Flamelash to your runs without triggering phalanx or that pack of guards that's pretty rough to deal with. Then bribe people with Ribbly's 16 slot bag + Flamelash's trinket. The ole' triple trinket run.
---
Rogues who already have 2-4 ways to break slows and snares (instantly, I might add) benefit more from Escape Artist than WoTF? That's a negatory, my man.
---
Lame fix your game instead.
---
Not setting the good example using fly hacks tho  :/
---
And then they won't get invited . Simple solution
---
Wondering the same. The murlocparliament website does a pretty good job at explaining things IMO. Consulted it a few times, but Grid is acting pretty nice now. 
---
Getting some annoying error messages whenever someone enters/leaves group or raid, though, relating to how the position of players or groups changes based on these additions/subtractions of members. Really don't know how to get rid of those, and my version is up to date.
---
Why no arms warrior? From my experience they had insane dmg during the level progress and made it easier for the tank to  keep the mobs grouped.
---
And then I heard some guildies on discord claiming someone will get 14 on first week and everyone else will get placed on a rank based on how much honor the highest person had ... big facepalm moment , I am sure they are not the only ones thinking the same
---
Been in BRD since 52, now 57 on my rogue.  Still no HoJ.  I'm almost to the point of respecing for the Anger and Shanker solo build.
---
you know what you signed up for
---
Mmmmm rogue tears. Should've made a more original class choice.
---
I don’t see it
---
Yeah you tell someone who wants to roll orc warlock for stun resistance to play human instead and see what happens.
---
I found a guide which basically tells you to use your talents like this:

---
Is this usable if you want to be able to pve and pvp?
---
Also the Auberdine pier is infested with horde on my server at all times. The guards there don't even agro half the time because they're so low level.
---
those are dark times
---
No one does submerge do they?
---
they're trying to get to the player and can't because no path is available. That is not the same as outrunning. You also fucking know that.
---
just wait for bgs then you'll see horde complaining cuz queue and broken paladins
---
Apart from the honor penalty
---
Dominating the server 4:1 hasn't been that much fun since the second day. It's just a game of group up with 3 friends and go on a world tour scouring felwood-winterspring-epl-wpl-BRM for the 4 alliance players gathered in whatever corner and then travelling to the next spot when they port out.
---
The only way he's having fun is if he's on one of the few well balanced servers.
---
I used to do this back in Quel'danas (or whatever it was called) during BC.
---
I'd MC an Alliance player and my Pally buddy would heal and buff them. They'd almost always panic and attack, but quickly realize what happened and stop
---
When he knocks back the tank, the OT needs to go in immediately because he will attack the next closest person. If melee is already moving in before the OT they will get bopped. 
---
Written by a rogue who was getting continuously bopped.
---
I’m 60 for a long time and I still take 57-59s in my groups.
---
I mean why are you even complaining if your moral high ground has given you so many alleged friends to play with. Loot drama shouldn't even exist for your utopic groups where everyone holds hands.
---
How is it possible for you to be this dense?
---
I still boggles my mind that mages ever made it into the game as grotesquely OP as they are.
---
Does he have evidence? I'm not watching a literal neckbeard blah blah for 10 minutes 
---
And besides the point: In no way does that contradict anything I've said. Again, the GM simply may have made a mistake with the call if it indeed happened like that.
---
The world pvp grind is just insanely boring and we need objective based stuff ASAP.
---
Holy paladins benefit uniquely from crit compared to every other class in 2 way. 
---
A. 100% mana return on crit means each 1% crit reduces your mana consumption by 1%. When you stack crit especially with wbuffs you rarely look even when spamming.
---
B. Flash of light is very efficient, and due to it healing for a smaller amount when you crit it tends to translate into effective healing instead of overhealing.
---
Keep in mind volatile power is 2 and 1/3 a crit. 10 more int on power, 29.5 int per crit.
---
There isn’t a honor penalty
---
At the end of raid the mages in my guild love to give us a portal roulette by stacking the portals to Ironforge, Stormwind, and Darnassus. Very blursed.
---
The Benediction Quest is a walk in the park, but I guess its kinda like cheating when you have step to step guides. I had 2 peasants die on my first try, but I knew exactly what I was doing.
---
If I went in blind, it sure would have taken a bit longer.
---
As explained in the video, the guards did keep saying "huh!" so they did agro.
---
You can pvp from the roof, as long as you're not avoiding guards by doing so. Blizzard doesn't want people to bypass game mechanics to attack other players.
---
Just give us back layers problem solved
---
Classic installed folder size is 4,94GB on OS X.
---
Hots + thorns + swipe is the reason that on pull threat for druids is a lot more solid than it is for middling and bad warriors, especially when they're dps spec. I'd argue that a great warrior in prot spec will have better handling of aoe threat than a great druid, nut that's not the concern up for comparison most of the time, so yeah, hail druids.
---
Worst idea I have ever heard, gladly going to kill more and more flymasters.

WELLLLLLL obviously we have a rapist in Southshore.  He's climbin in your window, he's snatchin your ppl up tryin to rape em.

So, yall need to hide yo kids, hide yo wife and hide yo husband cause they rapin errbody out here.
---
Never seen a GM in game before, thanks for sharing
---
Yuck and it has fungus all over it.
---
That's really bad.. So if let's say a healer with 7-8 BiS items joined your guild (got geared in his previous guild), and your current healers have 2-3 BiS items, that means he's never getting loot, atleast not for the next 2-3 months..
---
So... I never get to play my lvl 52 hunter?
---
How annoying can a person be to not see the problem here. Fool.
---
If it's bannable, why don't they just put up a wall in the spots that allow you to exploit? Blizz doesn't hesitate a second to fix other exploits, why are these any different?
---
Why would they? Geez they can't regulate everything, where would the fun be?
---
\&gt;  play on a PVE server 
---
I wonder what would have happened to the players on the roof if they had shouted that back at the GM instead of coming down.
---
I play alliance on Gehennas, idk who you're talking to.
---
11/8 into retribution is a great start.
---
"I see no god up here, other than me"

there are 55 elite guards at the docks in menethil harbor
---
Yes not everyone is level 60 who pvp's. But you now conveniently try to hide that the difference is more than factor 100. Questie classic has over 10 mio downloads on Curse alone. So if you are saying that only a 100st of the player base is pvping and part of the pvp community eh? When there's at least double the amount of PVP realms than PVE realms.
---
Look you obviously have an agenda. That's fine. Just stop lying around, yes?

How does Spy then notice players who are mounted and therefore not doing anything triggering combat log entries?  My spy even notices players flying on flight paths. Surely they aren't producing anything in the combat log.
---
Remove spy add-on

It bypasses game mechanics to give you an unfair advantage.
---
You can't sneak up on someone using it.
---
Yeah imagine not following a leveling guide and having fun pvping lol.
---
Mages only get a new rank of conjure mage water every 10 or so levels
---
Which means our water sucks until 60
---
(Also we need to do a quest to get it at 60)
---
Okay like I said, it's not a balance issue, it's an exploitation issue. Blizzard has already patched some exploits in booty bay, so clearly they are doing things based on community feedback.
---
Why would they patch some exploits and not other identicle exploits?
---
I have 4200 HKs and it's been a real slog running around smoking out the little packs of scared allies scattered around the key zones on my horde dominated server. I just don't want to have to take a mage portal for every 7 kills i find.
---
I can entirely get behind this. Sometimes I'm doing these runs for quests, xp or gold, and I'd be entirely fine with giving up HoJ. I mean it sucks, but there's still lots of other stuff to be had.
---
I thought they said daily reset, not weekly?
---
Another post complaining about the complainers. It goes full circle.

Hallelujah hallelujah halleluuuuuujah
---
Waiting for the absolute mountain of salt coming when the ranks update and people realise they've been complete pieces of shit for absolute no gain at all
---
Pouring all that time and dedication on an alt on a PvE server only to pass the time so you can get back to your main on your PvP server feels like an enormous waste in my opinion.
---
MC the person who lands -&gt; attack with them -&gt; they now grant honor
---
Get your guild to help you. I'd love to camp someone from the other faction to death who did this.

Yeah I also have at least 4 former pserv r14 in my guild farming honor in zergs ;)

---
It's the only way to farm honor in a significant way as long as BG's aren't released. If you don't then you'll be the looser in this PvP system.
---
With a Seal of the Archmagus he must be really drunk!
---
Ashbringer, almost 50-50 ratio at every level range and full pop
---
Confirmed info
---
It balanced out the more people they threw at a battle/keep, or whoever's swung in last with the cc train.
---
That was good pvp
---
So classic has the better talentsystem is what you are saying ?
---
Retail probably is more your pace though.
---
People coming from Menethil are flagged when they get off the boat.
---
What is the minimum group to do arena farm if I am a war? If we are three (healer/dps/tank) is it hard?
---
Well, if its any consolation, we only have one priest left who needs Benediction, and our 6 last drops have been the leafs :p
---
Freezing band proc make your character do casting animation and applies its effect like any proc weapon.
---
1) Does fixed 50 frost damage (cannot be increased by spell power) and stun/freeze enemy for 5 seconds. 
---
2) Can proc multiple times, shares diminishing returns with stun related effects (intercept, hammer of justice, kidney shot, seal of justice etc). 3) Cannot be broken by damage which places this above any root/freeze effect. 
---
4) Counts as freeze and does benefit from shatter.
---
5) Procs from melee attacks which does apply at least one damage. (Doesnt proc from dodges, parry and shielded attacks)
---
And apparently DOESNT count as stun while sharing DR with it. I can only explain it by developer oversight. Its quite minor in its nature but still frustrating.
---
As much as i'm on the unsub train right now, i think you are completely right. Blizz didn't 'force' anything, it merely provided exactly what the community wanted. 
---
Just that it didn't turn out so well is not on Blizz this time.
---
Nah you're out of range vertically lol below there are guards, the archway connects from a hill above them that you can walk right on from
---
Technically, if you were on a dead server 1000 honor points could be enough to get 13000 rating points, as it's comparing you to other players on your faction.
---
&gt; It's just sad people that do, how can you get satisfaction from that? 
---
I play a Restoration Shaman and getting ganked by a rogue (or pretty much any other class really) feels kinda the same way as being a lowbie since my offensive capabilities are next to nothing. I can pull off one Earth Shock and an instant heal with Nature's Swiftness, but that's pretty much all I can do in that fight. No flurry, my one-handed mace ain't gonna murder anyone with WF crits, my whole build and gear are for buffing a party and AOE healing.
---
So, just being 60 doesn't mean much in a lot of cases. Of course it never happened that a Priest or Druid tried to 1v1 me (so at least we'd have a cripple fight), it's always getting charged by Warriors and stunlocked by Rogues.
---
So they're not going for R14 now then I take it.
---
Do you have reading comprehension issues? The person griefing him is from the same faction as him - or are you just being deliberately obtuse and too caught up in pasting out mindless PvP "replies" left and right?
---
I think you're talkki g about in the video, the guards I'm talking about in Silithus pay no mind
---
Power move.
---
Jesus have people here never done any like competent BG's or something? You already would be running (assuming you care) an add-on that tells you all of the enemy players and classes. If you target a rogue, he's probably going somewhere. If you can't and a base is empty, he's probably there. If you can't and their based are defended then the rogue is more than likely going for a stealth cap.       
---
Im not sure why spy would be an issue in classic AB when it's not an issue in any retail casual and ranked bg since it's been released (in the sense of stealth notifications)
---
The Necropile set is also good for PvP, so Scholo is a win win for people looking to survive the open-world.
---
One problem is that most pvp servers are horde favoured so finding servers to merge would be hard. 
---
One option would be to allow for faction change on servers with severe faction balance issues. 
---
However I’m not sure if that is going to cause even further issues
---
&gt; Ranking doesn't work like it did in Vanilla anymore
---
Prove it.
---
Finding a caster for free is easy for arena spam and I found plenty of healers willing to do a 15 minute arena spam for a chance at 100g
---
its not a "garbage bait"
---
¿Que?
---
Here's another one for you that happens to me all the time: 
---
MrX to LFG -&gt; "LF DPS &lt;insert dungeon here&gt;.
---
Me to MrX -&gt; inv me, Rogue with good gear.
---
MrX to LFG -&gt; "LF RDPS &lt;insert dungeon here&gt;.
---
Most times I don't even get a respond xD
---
It’s a rank points penalty. -100 instantly. We have honor this week. We don’t have rank points.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/EzVPnZABeepdC/giphy.gif
---
asmon was banned for doing the same exact thing
---
To be fair, and this is coming from someone who leveled on a pvp server, for newer players that wants to start leveling up on a PvP server they will have a very different experience leveling to 60 now that P2 is out compared to me who got to 60 in P1. Alot of the time players from opposing factions where minding their own business because of no reward system. The game has completely changed from leveling P1 to leveling P2
---
Why are you complaining when you’ve already established you give zero fucks about anyone but yourself?
---
Imagine if they transferred all Horde characters to Alliance on some realms during weekly maintenance, swapping shaman gear for spec-appropriate paladin gear of similar ilvl/progression to facilitate realm transfers and increase the Alliance pool.
---
That sure would be something to wake up to.
---
because the chest piece was updated around the time of AQ and you are receiving the massively buffed item... you can shit on the game all you want but you're not actually playing vanilla, dont pretend that you are
---
It’s really not that bad.. our guild still clears the raids weekly, I can still find dungeon groups, etc. I’m on a high pop server and I think the only time it’s ever interfered with my gameplay is when I died a few times to get to Strat. Economy is about the same even consumables are still the same price. I’m genuinely curious what people are trying to do that experience this much of a problem. I think the only people affected are level 50s trying to quest and anybody farming gold in the open world
---
No shit, people found out that getting 1-7 honor per kill was really shit compared to 100+ per kill in smaller groups.
---
HK's doesn't equal Honor gain.
---
Doesn't mean that anything is dying out.
---
I'm not sure why you think questing in any way changes the 1.5 bars a day to 1.
---
Bitch and moan that they need battle groups
---
Imagine if they transferred all Horde characters to Alliance on some realms during weekly maintenance, swapping shaman gear for spec-appropriate paladin gear of similar ilvl/progression to facilitate realm transfers and increase the Alliance pool. 
---
Thanks, though I have actually looked through that! I was mainly curious about other people's personal preferences.
---
yet your explointing with spy
---
You can two man farm Arena with warrior + healer.
---
If it is just about farming arena with the lowest number of people. Hunters and Warlocks can probably solo it.
---
You wont have honor if you’ve managed to get a DK without getting any HK’s lol
---
It will be so funny most people will wake up tomorrow to being rank 1 and rank 2 :)
---
Depends tbh. Maybe he is a tank on hire.
---
You need to be in the raid/party to summon someone.
---
Thanks bud but why would we want to destroy them?
---
Oh no I'll have to watch Netflix while I wait, or go back to camping alliance in south shore while I wait.
---
Reroll on a PvE server.
---
I mean, its a PvP server. PvP's gonna happen.
---
If mergers wont work, then there is the option of simple scrap some low-pop dead realms and have faction specific transfers to fitting servers. Also a radical option for sure.
---
&gt; BG's are cross-realm.
---
And battlegroups are restricted to server types, meaning one battlegroup cannot consist of PvP and PvE realms, meaning, PvP battlegroups will likely have more horde queues, which means hordes will roam the world killing stray alliance while all pvp-alliance are in battlegrounds. ":)"
---
Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender
---
You’re wrong
---
I've been farming Arena/Anger in a 3-man group (warrior/priest/mage) for a bit. We are all lvl60s with nearly all BiS and a few pieces of MC/Ony gear. Each run takes about 12-15 minutes (or &lt;10min if we skip arena). It's pretty easy as long as everyone is aware of the aggro range for mob packs and interrupt /cc the healers. With a priest it's even faster thanks to mind soothe. Bats in Arena are somewhat tricky due to their ability to silence but it's relatively rare and people who are overgeared won't wipe on those.
---
However there's very little incentive for the healer/caster to repeatedly do these runs so you need friends who are willing to do you favours.
---
30 min to 4 hours. Depends on your setup and skill.
---
so, how will server mergers deal with massive queues? Wont that just cause the snowflakes to take to reddit demanding blizzard fix this too?
---
I don't like DM tribute even though I spent hours learning it and burning it into my memory.
---
It's a very involved farm, not passive at all. There's a lot of room for error and you have to adapt to different circumstances, and there's always a risk of a FD resist that ruins the run.
---
I prefer passive brainless farms. Like going around Burning Steppes mining. It gives around 25g per hour (excluding potential Arcane Crystals and Blood of the Mountain). But you can do it for hours while watching YouTube or Netflix. Very passive, barely requires thinking. Some days I do 3-5 hours and don't even notice.
---
You were lvl 37 for a week?
---
you say 
---
&gt; and back then people weren’t camping every fp/boats/dungeons entrances in p2 
---
Where you there ? at actual Phase 2 US Release ?  
---
I reckon you are not... Can people stop claim they where there, because this happened alot !  
---
The only difference with then, is that the realm pop was way lower, so the PVP was lower as well in absolute / total numbers, but not % based.  
---
Its not even been a week, and people are screaming their lungs out, because they are regretting that they rolled on a PVP server.  
---
Give it some time, i already notice on different servers that the huge Zerg groups are toning down.  
---
But there will be dangerous zones, like STV - BadLands- thorium Point , BRMountain... this was also back in the day...  
---
So please Calm your tits
---
Looks like the old playfield and mom coming to tell the boys to come down
---
It’s -100 rank points
---
15 horde Vs 2 alliance on a 4:1 server isn't PvP.
---
It's only horde who constantly spout this.
---
I think Horde is better at offensive and damage while Alliance is better at the defensive parts. Purge is just so huge in terms of removing shields, rejus, fap, lip etc. Also a totem that slows everything around a big area is great for big skirmishes.
---
WOTF is also just great against priest healers since they have only one thing to cc with and that is fear. 
---
Orcs Stunreduction is also great for casters and healing shammys since they can resist some critical stuns and land their spells.
---
Alliance however have Paladins which has great buffs and good dispelling. No purge but still some great buffs. Paladins are also hard to kill but they are also immobile and offensive wise pretty weak.
---
I am silly like that. And yes, I was xD
---
In vanilla, on my server, LBRS was always pugged as 10 man. (But so was Scholo and Strat until they patched that out.)
---
I like this “your fault for choosing the wrong faction and go cry in your own corner” attitude (sarcasm). No one started to play Wclassic to play on a realm with 3 times the population of what it was in vanilla and getting ganked 500 times a day from the second you hit 48 just because of massive overpopulation and imbalance of the factions. Few actually knew that it would be the case and many of us just don’t have the time to reroll just like that. 
---
It’s probably still amazing fun being the stronger faction on the realms that are imbalanced.  Even to some players in the less represented faction. This will however snowball out of control if it’s 60/40 or worse. The stronger faction will lose opponents eventually creating a pve realm out of an pvp realm because everyone left or quit. No one that rolled a pvp realm wants that.
---
Call it what you want, being an idiot or a noob, they will quit, they will leave and the game will become boring to most people who love pvp. Imo.
---
Horde player detected
---
The overall player distribution across all US servers if pretty dang close to 50:50.  Ergo the queues for horde will be fairly minimal.
---
Can't believe you're getting downvoted this sub is cancerous as fuck
---
What about the game is  being exploited? It's not harming any systems all it does is read the combat log (like a damage meter) then apply a /target macro. Nothing exploitive about it when it was around in vanilla and nothing bad now.
---
I can fully understand people on unbalamced servers. But plz dont release bgs on balanced servers, for my server open pvp feels incredble good at a 45% h -55% a scale (im on 45% side)
---
nah dude wisp form makes up for the passive stun resist don't worry about it
---
the idea of a pvp server is that yes you can and should engage in combat anywhere you want in the world, BUT there are also spots that are protected by guards, so that people can interact with quest givers, inn keepers and repair vendors in relative peace.   if the guard protection does NOT work , that is against the design philosophy of that area.
---
You are allowed to kill the guards, but that should work in a way that the guards fight back,  assist each other etc, so usually it means you need a small raid or strong party to accomplish that.  not some  lame solo sniper hiding on a rooftop.  THAT is why it's against the rules.
---
Finding a lvl 60 dps literally takes 10 seconds...
---
I have also played PvP servers since vanilla and have never experienced anything like this, and have often been on similarly unbalanced servers. 
---
I don't mind skirmishing on my way to blackrock mountain, and dying every now and then, but not getting camped and doing 10+ corpse runs every single time.
---
It is purely a design flaw from Blizzard in there structured release that has led to this problem. Staggering world PvP and BGs sounds great in theory, unfortunately not so great in practice on unbalanced servers.
---
Unfortunatly good rogues are Horus :(
---
Creating one lvl 57 was already extremely time consuming especially a worrior I just don’t have that option... if I could I would.
---
Which is still a microscopic portion of the population.  People just like to bitch about the stupidest stuff.
---
Trying to level a 37 cat to 60 is harder than waiting 1 week in level 37 :D
---
Pretty sure they working on this with faction based free servertransfer
---
Doesn't help if you're never in range of the guards. Though the fix in Gadgetzan seems to have been pretty effective, they now aggro if your target is within range of guards (not just yourself) and they have massive spammable knockback on their attacks.
---
Do NOT listen to this guy.
---
Had a rogue last time that soloed the whole thing. We only had to move through after both fires were lit and respawn disabled.
---
I was today years old when I learned there was a teleporter.
---
Yesterday had to fly from BB to SM.
---
a Player gives you 200 Honor, and its beging splitted with all the people who tag it.  
---
You only tag it, and kill it, you get 200 honor.  
---
You kill it with 4 people, you get 25 honor.  
---
After the first kill the same player is worth 100 Honor.  
---
So you can do the math again.
---
You were replying on their behalf...
---
Best plot twist I've seen all week.
---
They made a lot of fixes to limit exploration over the years, though.
---
Gandling has a healthy community is and is like 60% Horde 40% Alliance.
---
AS 55lvl SP... yep, i still have my leveling build on, (no stun resist/no stun affect) 5 points in spirit tap (mana restore after kill) and honestly i can tell, i did not meet one lvl 60 that would allow me to do my quest in peace.
---
I do understand, it is honor time, nut to be honest, i am playing much more than i should, and still i only have 55lvl and played from like week 2.
---
3. Those sub 60 is rolling on the gear i want to sell.
---
Maybe google it? It’s -100 rank points instantly it isn’t honor. No one has rank points.
---
Nobod is stopping you to start a fund raiser.... go for it man.
---
He literally isn't complaining about 1v1 at all.
---
He is explaining why he doesn't want to join his guild at Hillsbrad.
---
You should learn to read.
---
People are also dumb camping flight points or instance entrances.
---
Last night I was helping out a few guild mates doing Arena/Anger runs. So we frequently had to run out of BRD to reset. Problem was, a 15-man horde zerg was camping the entrance for hours, making us do really long-ass corpse runs from thorium point every time we wanted to reset. I just wish these noobs would realize that they get no honor from killing players that come out of an instance portal. There is this buff called "Honorless Target" that lasts for 30 seconds, making you give no honor to the other faction. You get this buff when you exit an instance or when you land after taking a flight master.
---
So camping flight masters and instance portals is pointless and a waste of everyone's time.
---
Cause a lot of times they will split off too many mobs from main tank, then I'm healing two tanks essentially, then they die and either myself or my highest DPS will gain agro and die. Happens too often with people trying to get #1 DMG done. Also if I get too many mele dps they dont let any clotheies drink and I as the healer, get told to 'keep up'.
---
I wish they would just 1 month them. It's not like "Oh I accidentally ended up on the roof"
---
Fuck it. Shit needs to stoo
---
They prolly occupied every inch on the streets of southshore already, so people gotta climb on the roofs to fit in.
---
Its hell but so many quests so you suck it up and do it
---
Just a thought, I wonder if you can post the google survey to different servers discord channels?
---
Yep, no rank points no penalty.
---
Hp and armor. At around 45% armor reduction(no shield) and 5k+ hp they start having a bit of a difficult time bursting you down. It's better if you run around in def stance so they have to open on more DR. It still wont be a sure thing, but yeah.
---
And they did say "with FAPs and engineering", so he's using faps to not get sapped.
---
It's worth getting both Details! and ClassicThreatMeter for this reason. Or, if you are in a guild, settle for one or the other.
---
Try for yourself, and dont be influenced by the vocal minority here.
---
Not exactly what your saying but alliance have held the road to DM frequently these last few days, I see guildies complain about being jumped there all the time. 
---
We are also the ones camping the boat in menethil, to be fair.
---
Do you currently feel like a microscopic portion of the population is ranking? On my server (Gehennas) there's constant fighting, in every zone, at any time of the day.
---
1. Vanilla didnt have 7k servers. 2. Honorless target buff is in classic, you get it upon exiting dungeons and flightpaths, but you get killed 1 second after landing anyway because either Most people dont know, or they dont care
---
I agree but if blizzard seriously didn’t see this coming when the placed a roof one jump from the flight path in darkshire thats just poor game design imo
---
The guards can't get up there, though, defeating their purpose.
---
Not that it matters in a 100v10 massacre, but still.
---
Warriors have always been popular as alts because of how much easier it is when you can bankroll them with a lvl 60
---
Hunters can solo DM North and sell items from chest, many ppl would probably rather pay.
---
Just put in BGs
---
For some classes just getting rank 7 for boots+gloves can be a nice goal since decay isn't too bad at that rank and the 2pc bonus is really nice. For example the pvp mage boots are waaay better than the alternatives because 1% hit and the 23 sp 2pc makes the gloves better too.
---
They are, go to your combat log settings and tick every possible checkbox, you'll see messages like "X gains Battle Stance", "Y gains Mithril Shield Spike", "Z gains W's Prayer of Fortitude" and similar crap when somebody enters your loggable range (200 yards I believe).
---
"Hello darkness my old friend..."
---
I see you tryna pickpocket a GM bro
---
Yeah high pop servers now and back in vanilla mean totally different things. I a way the removal of layers made the gank squads so much worse and lessens the experience.
---
Run away to max range first blizzard and they wont reach you after 2 blizzards.
---
If you get resists -&gt; Ice barrier -&gt; Flamestrike -&gt; Coc -&gt; run around in a circle and spam AE rank 2 until you get a freecast for max rank AE. Reapply coc or frostnova -&gt; flamestrike again depending on the hp left on the mobs.
---
You will die for some hours until it clicks and it get's easy as fuck. Every mage went through those hours, don't give up.
---
#boomersriseup
---
Purge is not "huge" as priests can already offensive dispel. Earthbind is only 10 yards and not affected by Totemic Mastery, so not a "big" area.
---
WOTF is a joke in group PvP compared to fear ward, which is on a short CD and lasts 10mins. There is simply no comparison.
---
This is wrong. 200honor first kill is correct. Every kill after is 10% less. Meaning your 11th kill and onwards on that player in 24 hours will give 0. Also 4 people kill = 50 honor. I knew what ya meant just think you had a typo
---
You win some you loose some. Queues is preferable to massive faction imbalance.
---
I would open Silithus and Eastern plaguelands WPvP objectives. Dunno why it isn´t pushed to phase 2... Sad.
---
So basicly a system to make already geared players rich?
---
&gt; It is worth far more to just farm now
---
Good luck doing that with the current gank squad meta in every region.
---
Or kill millions of boars!
---
That’s like, the next level of generosity haha. I wish I could provide that kind of resources to my guildies!
---
Problem is in the code not with servers. No amount of money is gonna fix crap code. MMOs 15 years ago on potatos could handle more players then current WoW.
---
That one troll ore in hinterlands where you have to climb from the other side of the hill &gt;.&gt;
---
Don't think of it as a roast, think of it as ideas on how to improve. He even has cooking on a hotkey, yet he can't buff himself with it?
---
Claw + screech is worthwhile. Ideally you use a macro to bake your pet's abilities into your normal DPS ability rotation so that you may leave growl on autocast and not struggle with total focus depletion.
---
&gt;Even more so since all active alliance PvPers will be in BGs, there will be noone to fight the horde in the open world,
---
yeah its good to have three monitors, I can kick back, relax and watch some movies while I wait or play another game. It's 2019 man, not 2004 I'm not gonna sit around and twiddle my thumbs while I wait, we have the technology.
---
I don't think they said they were the most knowledgeable but hey assuming the guy said something nobody said in the first place is cool and rational. Those systems are also bullshit. I remember going through that hell in Lineage 1 when the high levels would come camp starter zones and grief literally every player spawning in for the first time.
---
Thats what these morons dont understand. PVP is PLAYER versus PLAYER. 1v1, or hell, even two versus 1 is acceptable.
---
ANYTHING more than that, including guards is full on shit. Why? Because after 2 kills, you get no honor anyways, but these wannabe edgy kids on horde seems to relish in camping people for hours with 5+ people.
---
Case I've seen recently was a level 34 in my guild was in STV. There was 11 horde, all 45+, majority of them were 60s, camping a measly 34 mage...like really? He even tried logging out to go grab some food, etc. Got back on, 2 of the 60s were STILL SITTING ON HIS CORPSE.
---
Thats when most of our guild ran back to camp STVietnam.
---
We got settled in to do some hoj runs for my warrior friend the other day expecting it to take a few hours. First kill it dropped and I had a whole day with nothing to do.
---
If you're orc you should be able to to resist a lot of their stuns. Keep poison cleansing totem up to remove poisons. Searing totem to keep them in combat and maybe Flame Shock? Not sure which shock is best actually, might want most direct damage. Learn to fake cast, cast for half a second then stutter step. You could try using your hearthstone...
---
Idk call me crazy but I like phase2, I'm playing on Noggenfogger EU and if I am not mistaken we have like 60:40 ratio with Horde being the majority, now all the contested zones actually feel contested and people are killing each other on sight. But for some reason that 60:40 doesn't feel like a huge difference, Alliance is well organized for pvp, they even raided major horde cities before ph2 was even out. Also, people are pumped up for PVP, like yesterday a few of our guild members couldn't enter BRD, half of the guild flew there and cleaned the entrance, it looked so good that I got the chills.
---
still not sure if he got confused with DM beaing DireMaul instead of DeadMines
---
explain or are you just using a cool buzzword you saw elsewhere on reddit.
---
They've also never done an actual server merge in history. Only connected realms, but there's no way that's happening in classic since that involves phasing.
---
Solid advice thanks I appreciate it. Did you use a regular or epic mount for that?
---
Whenever I join groups with a shadow priest they're always doing tops 40% of my damage..whilst they oom and I'm still on 3k mana good to go. I've yet to join a group with a shadow priest that does half decent dmg tbh.
---
Nice map! I need to do the same as a left handed!
---
u/Superkran: *assumes anyone who is tired of the faction imbalance posts is horde*
---
most people will stop being dickheads when they realize their time investment will award close to no honor. wpvp will die down in a matter of weeks.
---
I'm 60 on a PvP server and not using this one, wasn't even aware of it until people started making countless posts but now I'm wondering if it's worth picking up - if the PvP stays the same over the upcoming week or two (which I doubt) I might give it a shot. And Paranoia rings some feint bell, but to be fair - I'm willing to bet my Fire Totem that a lot fewer people used it back in the day than people who are using/will be using Spy this time around, purely due to information flow. 
---
Streamers, Youtube vids, a million reddit posts - pick your poison, you'll see it used or mentioned somewhere, to a much greater extent than in ye olde days, as you yourself allude to.
---
Ashbringer is the most balanced if I looked correctly.
---
Albeit I feel like Alliance is going strong on Shazzrah as well. Even though the statistics say they shouldnt. 
---
Alliance pretty heavily murder people on here. The literal only way for me to feasibly survive in WS when I farm Timbermaw rep is in a 4-5 man guild group. Otherwise alliance will kill me every 5-10 minutes.
---
And our guild recently tried to do an UBRS gold run but couldnt pull it off because Alliance held the entrance for an hour straight preventing any summons.
---
Oh, guess I misunderstood =)
---
its actually a good roast :)
---
Oh of course, on european keyboards the Y and Z keys are switched 😅
---
Came down? Down from where? Heaven? :D
---
I totally feel that man. Stick with it, not a ton of people doing what you do as more time passes. I’m all for it
---
They’re trolling, or just really stupid lol
---
Lots of guilds have a seperate blacklist channel in their discord, where they just list names or screenshots of players that have been mean to them... And yes its petty.
---
If they kill you after you get your body but before you zone back into the dungeon then they get honor though. So it's not a complete waste of time, just suuuuper inefficient.
---
so how does Spy distinguish horde from alliance players? On flight paths they're both blue.
---
Because we are past the point where blizzard will make significant changes to Classic code base. So instead of assuming that it should be allowed because it is technically possible, people should just behave and play nice.
---
Imagine spending time on enemy territory, looking for glitches in game design just to be reported by some cunts that cant follow you there and kill you
---
I agree with A but I do not believe B is true.
---
In which case, rock will one or two shot paper if he crits. And then he wins.
---
if he submerges you're doing something wrong
---
You showed up to the wrong neighborhood white boi.
---
I have not. Seems like you are doing that for me.
---
That's a good point. Do big PVP battles still happen on PVE servers like southshore vs tarren mill?
---
No it's available as soon as you hit R7.
---
My favorite thing is roaming around winterspring on my fully raid geared SL warlock and disposing of all the pleb solo warriors trying to farm e'kos. I love when they intercept me and hit me with a crit, only to have it do a measly 20% of my total health. It's even more fun when I kill them for the 5th time and they just stand there knowing there's absolutely nothing they can do to beat me 😂
---
Fuck rogues, hunters, and other warlocks though. If they're above lvl 55 I nope the fuck out of there with my 109% mount and sit in everlook till they go away. I much prefer fighting classes I can easily win against, or people fighting mobs that are already at half hp. 
---
Even though I'm on a horde dominated server I'm loving p2 as alliance. Even more warriors for me to demoralize, and most of the horde are too dumb to bring their mount speed gear or too poor to afford epic mounts in the first place so I easily get away from them 😎😂👍
---
The main issue I have to explain to people in classic about pvp is that not every single class has healing options like in retail. Getting camped and killed by like 15 people when youre alone is not only not fun at all, but its a very fast way to make the entire game a chore and unfun. Doing shit like this is even worse.
---
They seem to think its cool for their high levels to sit in a low level zone for the sole purpose of being pricks. And the worst part is, NONE OF THE ALLIANCE FIGHT BACK it seems! I cannot say how many times I am getting jumped by 2-4 people at once, all at least 3-4 levels higher than I am, and a 60 rolls by and stops and stares at them instead of helping out, or any other people my level or their level just run by or /wave. THOSE people, it makes me smile when I die and see the horde rush to kill them as well.
---
But that is the real issue. The alliance not fighting back when they see another person attacked or something.
---
Facts. This is one buggy ass game that we’re addicted to.
---
Come join a PVE server if you don't like pvp. I'm on a pve server. Our problems are: need more tanks for dungeons and need more warlocks for Garr.
---
So.. we don’t know if dks has a penalty this week or? Gettinmixed signals here.
---
The spellpower coefficient of lower level spells only falls of for spells that have lower cast times at lower ranks.
---
I would suggest to you two to stay away from gems and jewels of any kind, and use soothe on any and all wolves you encounter.  
---
I wish you more luck in this world than the other/better one.
---
Now we wait and see who takes the bait.
---
Great post tho, sums up what's going on right now.
---
epic, but that has effect on zones with more spread out nodes. Swamp of Sorrows, Mulgore, Tarren Mill, Alterac Mountains are quite packed where as Barrens, Tanaris are more spread out.
---
Source? From the source I use it estimates 81% of raiding population is alliance, so I find your numbers hard to belive
---
I'm not sure how many druids we have in total, but we've 7 going, 5 resto, 1 feral tank, and 1 boomkin
---
Doing the most dmg makes him feel sexy, probably why he's asking.
---
Or the shaman is a druid and its s1 arena all over again.
---
No. Sunk cost *fallacy* is when you could get better returns elsewhere, but you don't cause you've already spent resources on the thing you're spending them on.
---
It applies primarily to investment. E.g. you invested 10k in a stock, and it's now down to 8k and is likely going to continue plummeting. You could sell, get 8k back and invest them in something with actual returns, but because of fallacious thinking, you don't want to "really lose" that 2k and instead remain invested, despite the fact that you could have had better returns elsewhere.
---
ssh is in a situation where he wants to do endgame content. He has two options for this, continue playing in a less rewarding pvp environment, or start over on pve. The barrier of entry to starting over on pve is legitimately higher than the extra enjoyment he'd eventually achieve by being on a pve server. That's not sunk cost fallacy.
---
I get that you know a phrase, but that doesn't mean that it applies everywhere someone has invested resources into anything.
---
Reminds me of the weird feeling when you watch scientific lectures by people who are already dead.
---
[No.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines)
---
To you
---
What is this spy addon people speak of?
---
**Betteridge's law of headlines**
---
Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no". It is named after Ian Betteridge, a British technology journalist who wrote about it in 2009, although the principle is much older. As with similar "laws" (e.g., Murphy's law), it is intended to be humorous rather than the literal truth.The maxim has been cited by other names since 1991, when a published compilation of Murphy's Law variants called it "Davis's law", a name that also crops up online (such as cited by Mark Liberman), without any explanation of who Davis was. It has also been referred to as the "journalistic principle" and in 2007 was referred to in commentary as "an old truism among journalists".The adage fails to make sense with questions that are more open-ended than strict yes-no questions.

Played an ally in nost , i did the right thing choosing horde on classic.
---
Less ganking  the flight masters are alive. Can actually walk out the dng without getting ganked. Life is simple as horde.
---
Though I suppose if you're attacked on your mount you won't be able to reequip your normal stuff?
---
Holy shit. 10/10
---
I've already decided not to renew my subscription. Was fun while it lasted
---
It literally says 100 honor loss when you get one kek
---
Horde dominated server too and loving it! Wish there were more alliance playing so I could get more kills, really gets boring playing as the overpopulated faction idk why the lower faction is complaining so much when you have so much PvP available!
---
I play on Noggenfogger and feel that the PvP is a bit insane, but we go in guild groups. Safety in numbers. I would avoid Noggenfogger if you never want login queues ( can happen on raid nights like Sundays ) and don't like to do world PvP at \*all\*.
---
undead rogue with edgy name!
---
Lmao. How to kill someone which has no life?
---
Group of 5 level 60 raidgeared alliance camping Maraudon entrance last night for level 49s. Got killed 4 times while running towards the entrance.
---
*Wrath pre-patch
---
Fuck Blizzard, it's so scuffed. I changed to coc instead.
---
Pull one side, let them stack (ice barrier ofc, you take a few hits), frost nova, flamestrike (if no resist, if resist, coc all), coc directly after flamestrike, kite around, few AE here and there (don't use that too much).
---
The "middle" section of the graves (the big pull) you use ice block.
---
Works like a charm.
---
Let me guess... you are Undead right? OMEGALUL
---
You're not wrong. The problem largely comes down to player behavior. If shitheads think it's healthy for the server to kill every low-level they outnumber 10 to 1, and repeatedly deny them progress in quests and dungeons, the more reasonable people who already have little time to progress are going to stop playing. It's already happening, and the game is being slowly killed on every PvP server so a few idiots with too much time on their hands can experience schadenfreude while everyone else starts to pack their bags.
---
I like my hunter but Im currently levelling a rogue and forgot how much fun, utility and awesome CDs this class has. I  can pop all my CDs and nuke 5 mobs in one fight feels awesome. Plus using alchemy alongside fighting is great for keeping my uptime going.
---
Is the pet on passive? If so, it won't autocast.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
Rock paper scissor is not balance, balance is when every class can beat every class and it fully depends on player ability to play said class. 
---
PPl dont get this is 15 years old mmo, u cant complain how ahead of the time game is, its incredible it still exists in this form today, u can complain about retail not being better tho.

Nelf hunter lvl 60, male 26 from Finland

😎😎😎😎😎 It's PvP server. What did they expect? 😎😎😎😎😎
---
There's an wowhead article that about basic concepts you should know - https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/threat-overview-classic-wow#generating-threat
---
It's all about optimal use of your rage to maximize threat, because you are not gonna be rage capped anytime soon. While leveling, outside of just doing high damage, best threat generators are revenge and sunder armor. Demo shout does almost nothing (good for mitigation), thunderclap is useless. Battle shout your best bet against large amounts of targets (4+), but only if you can buff enough friendly group members/pets with it (it's limited range). On a typical 3-4 mob pack you just tab sunder for most part.
---
Some tips for tanking while leveling:
---
1. arms is the best dungeon farming talent tree - tactical mastery and sweeping strikes are key talents you want to get ASAP
---
2. make macros to swap from 2handers to 1h+shield. You will often want to tank with 2hander and swap to 1h+shield in case you need more mitigation.
---
3. get a ravager weapon from SM Armory as soon as you can (usable at 37), this is best dungeon farming/tanking weapon until 50+.
---
4. at higher level the best opener is like this: equip 2hander -&gt; charge -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; berserker stance -&gt; berserker rage -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; defensive stance and equip 1h+shield (if needed to mitigate more dmg). Improved charge talent and having rage from previous pack helps to speed this up.
---
5. save up rage from previous pack to build initial aggro on next pack faster (you can even bloodrage to reduce rage loss if ppl need to drink).
---
60-40 is not healthy at all.
---
You can report him but blizzard is so money hungry, they won’t care enough because his $15 is so sweet
---
sadly yes, all the more reason to keep what we have left.
---
Spellcleave seems a bit of a meme to me - did BRD all melee, everything just melted and we had zero downtime except healer drinking a few times
---
 /thread it's a joke. Lost two friends this week who are over it lost about a dozen mates repelling as stv/dm/blackrock is a cluster fuck. It's not even pvp it's just a mess. 
---
Killed private servers gonna tank playerbase until there is a pvp alternative.
---
Can confirm the Mechanical Yeti makes a HUGE difference. I failed the quest 5 times as I was in full greens/blues. If you summon it at the beginning of the skeleton waves he will remain active throughout and 1-2 shot all of them. Use oil of immolation and only use Holy Nova if absolutely necessary. If you do it right you can save 50 on the 4th wave, reducing the risk of failing it due to a 5th wave with 20 more peasants. Mana pots/Dark runes/Food/Buffs all make a difference.
---
Get your T1 dungeon set and diremaul east lasher farming is super easy.
---
Dungeon set 1 is heavy on stats so preraid gear it’s pretty good for aoe since most spells don’t benefit from spell damage.
---
I just love playing feral in 5-mans. Every run in BRD I have to make some clutch innervate, off-tanking, battle-res etc. It's probably my favorite class to play in a 5-man.
---
Ask a group of people to protect you. The one in the Burning Steppes is the easiest, by far.
---
Can confirm, the Yeti works brilliantly. Glad I saved it.
---
So realy nobody was able to solo the quest? Too bad, I guess I have to find a group then
---
Idk. Seems like he was having a hard time. Could have cut him some slack maybe
---
I don’t care what they do, as I will be in BGs, doing pvp in 10v10 and not in 10v1 format, as it happens currently.
---
Eh the pvp these dudes are glorifying is pvep. Wait for arena it's wows only decent pvp system and it was great for a few expacs.
---
Easy way to get a 3 man as a warr for arena is looking for a caster dps(usually want sash) and letting the healer need all other items.
---
Shorter battleground queuetimes, fresh start for socials/guild with new ppl
---
they are strong, youre just too fucking bad to actually play your class *cries about dying in a stunlock while wearing cloth instead of mail*
---
The secret is to feign when they're quite far away, it allows you to gain som distance if it fails and try again.
---
Always wonder how some mages have that mage gear? We are 8 mages in our raid and in our 5 mc runs maybe 5 t1 items overall dropped for mages...
---
Thanks, but I also need your character's sex and your preferred role (DPS, Tank, Healer).
---
Horde bias.
---
Not sure why I’ve gotten downvoted, but I appreciate everyone’s input. It seems like warlock is a solid pick, and will be strong throughout all of classic. Now to go Orc or Undead..
---
Being an asshole is fun sometimes.
---
People have always ganked because they find it fun or funny to screw with low level players.
---
Still a trash way to farm honor. Max 15 honor per kill is a waste of time.
---
Would you recommend orc or undead?
---
&gt;That's actually a pretty bad place to fight, (...)  the horde graveyard is right there 
---
With this explanation it sounds like the perfect spot in the current meta, you can gank people multiple time and they can't rez at the graveyard or else you kill them again. If a big hord group arrive they'll probably just run away and change region since it's indeed not very efficient
---
The hardest part about Artorius was dodging all the wandering mobs. Like his name though, reminds me of Dark Souls.
---
Yea fuck you for asking a question. Fuck off cunt.
---
It's an addon that sends a stranger to someone's house to monitor what they're doing and then report back. If you get the premium option they can even 'take out' the competition (but of course no one really likes pay2win strategies ugh).
---
Detect magic
---
I hadn't thought of that, but I'm not part of any WoW classic Discord servers. I only just started playing over the weekend.
---
A horde guy used the mind control helmet to help my dumb ass glitch jump up to the lady who gives ony attunement in winterspring on bigglesworth, thanks bud you're the real hero lol
---
When BGs come out world PvP is an afterthought besides ganking anyways.
---
You can join ST with 50
---
In the future please don't try to name shame another guild on our server on Reddit. I invited you to our guild like 8hrs ago as your friends with 2 of our core raiders. 
---
I don't disagree or agree with your actions, but you're wearing our guild tag now and I would prefer not to have this kind of attention.
---
At one point you need to realise hes talking about his specific experience, on his specific server. Not your specific experience, on your specific server.
---
People got warned not to join streamer and super populated server and ignored it, people got warned that people will gank the fuck out of you if you arent max level by the time honor comes around and PVP can be miserable at times they ignored it.
---
And now they just bitch about how bad their server is and how they should be fixing it.
---
I mean, all that basically says is "only caster DPS need apply". There's Ban'thok Sash at least for them, and if you roll in Golem then it's decent for healers as well.
---
\*your. He even wrote it correctly literally in the comment you've replied to.
---
As a moonglow druid healer, should I be using rank 3 or 4 healing touch, I've read conflicting comments on here
---
Also, is spirit useful enough that the DM drink for +25 at the cost of -5 intellect is good? I assume so but thought I'd double check
---
Found the exceptional individual.
---
I was declined a ubrs run for being a 59 disc priest in mostly pre bis.... A few attempts later and I got in one, and smashed topped the healing charts, it felt good I must admit
---
On release of classic I leveled a Druid 1-60 in 6 days. I understand you might not have the time that I do, but I’m not going to assume anything about how much or how you play.
---
haha well the amount of crying when queues were an issue at launch says otherwise.
---
Don't tell me not to tell you what to do.
---
Yes I will if it's about that topic and with how gamefreak fucked over the fans of the franchise
---
It seems the community is roughly split in 3 groups:
---
1. The people who are on the receiving end of an unbalanced server who have a less than optimal playing experience. This group makes posts about how bad Phase 2 is.
---
2. The people who are on the giving end of an unbalanced server. These players seem to be the ones who complain about the Spy addon, because their few precious honor chunks are getting a warning and might try to run away.
---
3. The people who ended up on a fairly balanced server who are experiencing true World PvP
---
How stubborn are u? This game is many years old.
---
I didn't. I started on one of the smallest servers, but then Blizzard opened transfers to our server for Horde and now there's a shitton of them
---
Well I mainly remover one faction being a victim of the 2 others (the green one. I don’t remember the name...)
---
Sounds great for dps lol, have fun bud :)
---
Yeah lmao, so god damn salty.
---
you can still walljump. Tried it with getting above UC from the Lakeside. Worked like a charm. I hope nobody saw me falling through the Roof into UC though...
---
Well, is was so bad they had to make targets yield no honor after they land because every flightpath was camped. Vanilla pvp system release was the same shitshow just with less people and more lag.
---
Might be an Alliance issue, haven't seen much of that on the Horde side
---
Queues?
---
Mate, these are the guys who make the WoW stereotype! :D
---
Im afraid we retardins dont know such things as holy or prot
---
I agree on Arena being very easy. But doing anger as a 2man is pretty op
---
I was in a Scholo run two days ago. Our party consisted of 2x Tankadin, 1 Priest, 2 Mages.
---
Never had such a smooth run. Double Consecration is a beast to hold aggro. Us mages AOEd our hearts out at the drakes and exploding zombies, not once did we get the aggro.
---
Sure, you have to take a drinking break every now and then but which party doesn't?
---
&gt;Evenly distributed attacks is not the same as a more frequent proc rate though
---
Who cares about frequency of procs? You don't want 10 procs per 5 seconds you only need 1 to keep the debuff up, and that's it.
---
I use both depending on the situation. I have heard before rank 4 for dungeons and rank 3 for raids. I say Experiment!
---
maybe loot council lol
---
Yeah because there are people here pretending like it isn't a big deal, it's really pathetic. If they choose to think it's fine, then i'll keep ruining pvp LOL
---
I do this farm With 2.5k hp and 5.5k mana, Thats is 100% not his problem
---
I thought alliance was better for PvE (with the exception of speed clears) and also better at group PvP.  Horde had the advantage when fights were 1v1 or small enough that their personal racials gave them the edge.  Basically paladins &gt; shamans in raids and BGs.
---
They're referring to [this](https://youtu.be/NXX8URSUWm0), brother
---
Human rogues. Weapon Skill is a big fucking deal. But I see, your mind is made up and you just need to see ally as the underdog victimn faction right now.
---
you make it so simple, love your video
---
Let me ask you this and be honest. I don't care about you, you don't care about me.
---
Why would I take a non-fotm class over you? Why would I lower my chances of success? You would never do it. Humans don't care about others. You have friends - you don't actually care about them and they just mostly serve a goal (maybe even only emotional tampons) if you're truthful. Why would someone give you a chance to their own loss?
---
You wouldn't, so, why expect it of others? Or, wait, is this the classic "I say something that fits my angeda, then 180 when it doesn't" type of thing?
---
My guild leader could beat your guild leader in a fight!
---
Faction based transfers and faction based queues.
---
Don't forget the possible 1-2 Fireguards on the way there and out! Dangerous fellas!
---
PvE to PvP transfers would start a whole new amount of crying from the snowflakes!
---
I for one would like to hear from Buttnapper
---
Mages using detect magic
---
I said they added it in vanilla. And that was because ganking in vanilla was really really realy bad. Is was exactly like it is now: landing on any neutral town, especially light's hope was suicide.
---
Rerolled first month, fuck pvp
---
rank3 for sniping heals in raids, rank 4 for efficiency, max rank for high hps, and somewhere in the middle between rank 4 and max for spam healing with decent hp5 and efficiency, this last one is a lot harder to pin down, depends a lot on raid/group performance and your own stats.
---
Zandalar Tribe represent!!
---
Ah yes, this quest was the shit back in 2006(?). I was in a pretty hardcore raiding guild so I picked it up really early on, there wasn't a lot of info about it on the web and people would frown upon you if you used any sort of help. 
---
This was just you (with some mana pots) versus the Demons versus hordes roaming the area on a pvp server. I remember it actually took me a couple of days of adventure camping the spawn sites because of hordes around, and because of this some demons took me several tries (probably also due to the fact I was a 15yo kid still clicking half of my abilities). It felt like such a great accomplishment figuring all that stuff out back then, so I can imagine that even with all the knowledge we have about the game it's still easily one of the best quests out there.
---
It's doing actions for you. And it's not only just Spy, i'm talking about just pure honor farming exploits where bruisers will refuse to attack you in certain spots.
---
Actually, not even in certain spots, sometimes they will not attack you when you are standing next to them.
---
How paladins survive in PvP
---
U mean the icon or?
---
But if you spot a spy that is spying you, you can convert that one to your side with a bit of gold. And she reveals the identity of the person who hired her.
---
They won't reward honor if they are coming from a non contested zone. Otherwise it counts as a normal kill with honor.
---
I noticed often say t everything "it's easy", like they never experienced wipes or struggle.
---
A lot of groups struggle with stuff, and being lower level increases the risk considerably. While it may suck, I understand many want to lower the risk and do, say, a 1.5 hour scholo instead of 3.
---
Bit of a woosh moment but good for you being so wholesome man :)
---
you must be new here
---
I think blue pvp gear is available now, but the blue pvp set isnt untill p6.
---
The whole book is like a bible. A thrilling bible
---
Bleameux was fine.
---
Can confirm. Rolled priest first and rarely got a whisper for a group. Now levelling hunter and get a whisper every time I log in
---
Level to 10 then get a 60 warrior/mage to boost you and some low levels in RFC til 15, SFK to 26 and then SM LiB to 30.
---
What snowjob said but also adjust according to the playstyle of the other healers in your raid. If they're spamming flash heal/flash of light/lesser healing waves there's no point trying to complete rank 4 heals as a raid healing resto druid because most of your heals will probably just end up getting sniped.
---
I franky don't know how it's possible to make it player dependent rather than ckass dependent without some heavy homogenization.
---
It's a reference
---
I don't think most people take the game *that* serious.
---
you're also debating roof camping, in a thread posted by someone who was there and posted a screen shot showing the GM telling horde to get off the roof of the inn at south shore which is not a goblin town... you have pretty much zero credibility at this point.
---
Isnt this common sense? The bosses you kill need to drop something somebody wants for them to join?
---
Kromkrush is unbalanced to the point to where gameplay is broken, not happening on every single server but it sure as hell is on this one.
---
Did you leave and give him the fire eles? If so, you didn't fuck with him at all. He got what he wanted and you wasted your time complaining about him when absolutely nothing will happen. All while he was farming fire eles.
---
We were doing submerge in our first two runs. But after that 5 runs without submerges. So yea, starting raiding guild will have a submerge.
---
The problem is, that you think subconciously they are not skilled, because they are still &lt;60 after almost three months...
---
I'm perfectly fine with other people testing that theory.
---
 you're also debating roof camping, in a thread posted by someone who was there and posted a screen shot showing the GM telling horde to get off the roof of the inn at south shore which is not a goblin town... you have pretty much zero credibility at this point.
---
Yeah, who is this guy and why is he an icon?
---
Its not about bigger or stronger its about doing it as intended to show the ability of the class. 
---
As for saying it vs doing it. Show you can do it and shut me up.
---
Why would I take a lowbie over someone else? Why would I lower my chances of success? You would never do it. Humans don't care about others. You have friends - you don't actually care about them and they just mostly serve a goal (maybe even only emotional tampons) if you're truthful. Why would someone hinder themselves from reaching a goal?
---
You wouldn't, so, why expect it of others? When you queue up to do a dungeon, 99% of the time, you're there to finish it in reasonable time, not to waste time.  
---
It's not about easy or whatever. It's about "spend 50 mins vs. spend 2 hours".
---
This is not true for all realms.
---
I come from Gandling EU and the PvP is just awesome! 
---
I like BGs more than WPvP so i am not alot into it, i have been leveling my warrior and yesterday i did almost all my hillsbrad quests. I didn't get ganked(besides a couple of 19 rogue twinks) in this whole processed while lvl 60s were having raid battles. 
---
No flightmasters getting camped either.
---
People that rolled on a PvP server and complain about PvP are just dumb. Getting ganked and camped is part of the experience as it is something that YOU do when YOU have the power to do it. So stop bitching, get a group together and react.
---
Always love it when snowflakes cry about someone being on the roof. Is someone forcing you to pvp in southshore? If you're outnumbered, just move somewhere else. If you have equal numbers, just move out of town and horde will follow. It's not like the horde is there just to spawn camp npcs.
---
It is a visual bug, but he somehow manages to trigger it by using 2 mouse buttons haha.
---
Those items drop at like 3% drop rate. It is better to split the people who need them over multiple groups and have casters to fill the group. You dont need 5 people for those bosses anyway.
---
For keeping aoe threat I think its important that you let go of the idea that you need to make everything attack you.
---
It can be a bad idea to try to sunder a mob you have lost the control of. It happens often that you use 2 sunders and still you dont have the mob back (especially true if you are following him to the ranged dps and they got 3-4 hits on it in the meantime) and you end up having to taunt it anyway.  You have now wasted time that could have been used to increase your threat lead on the mobs you already control. This can lead to you loosing control over them. Gaining back control of a single mob is not worth it if you loose control over 3 others.
---
It can be better to just keep sundering the mobs you have under control and wait for your taunt. The dps will be fine with 1 mob attacking them.
---
Ofc this only applies to the dps, if your healer is being attacked you run to him.
---
tl;dr It can be alot better to have 4/5 mobs under control than to try to grab all 5 but ending up loosing all of them.
---
Thanks. I was worried that the -100 honor translated to more.
---
Still lvl 24 because I couldn‘t decide what to play for months. Hillsbrad should be a dead zone for me but yesterday I was playing for like 4 hours and only got killed twice. Was standing in alli raids and they didn‘t touch me multiple times. Maybe people are more friendly nowadays

Anger can be soloed by really well geared rogues to sell the trinket.
---
Sniping is sort of an issue for me. Only 2 shammies in our next raid so hopefully less so. Will keep this all in mind!
---
These are my current talens https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05520003-23505000032015-5
---
Are they ok?
---
Tried polymorphing a guy on 20% hp to reg him but when he was 100 he just straight up killed me
---
Keep thinking they do it for the honor gains
---
Cata was good because they actually managed to make every class pretty broken. So it was just the fact that every class had such a broken kit so everything was viable.
---
It’s actually why I kinda love Cataclysm while it also being the most dull and boring pve expansion (imo). S10-11 being so diverse in terms of comps and every single one of them being kinda OP.
---
But I agree, Wrath (post-s5) are probably the most appreciated arena experience.
---
Haha cheers for that, I worked out i was looking for /startattack just thought it was strange how the icon came up
---
Adding another element to the game. So true man, love it.
---
Yup, ppl want honor and fun so they go there instead of raidlog
---
Just so you know, theres an option on discord to only show whos talking
---
A bunch of pvp falls under this definition too.
---
Dont join Shazzrah. I play Alliance there and the server is dying apart from raid nights.
---
There is no coefficient difference between rank 2 flash and max rank flash m8.
---
I personally make my alchemy money by calculating the difference between the ingrediant price and the portion price and then producing that portion- these are often ones where you need special recipes, and can be boosted by gathering some or all of the materials yourself (or asking people to cod you things in world/trade at a discount)
---
Correct, with autocarrot I have a macro to disable it if I suspect there's a chance I'm attacked while mounted.
---
So far it's worked alright.
---
Shamans are never waste of space, even in early content. Sure, priests are more efficient, but healing is rarely the problem - always threat, dps or resistances.
---
Who would take a hunter lol, +50% chance to wipe
---
&gt;Horde has WC, SFK, RFK, RFD, and SM
---
don't forget rfc, the only dungeon in the game you can do at lvl 13/14
---
They did change it in normal WoW
---
Just going from LHC to scholo its about 55-60% horde.
---
Yes, it is, but people still have problems understanding it
---
Me as a prot warrior
---
No. We play together.
---
M 27 - M Human Mage (DPS) 
---
Though i usually go with healer/support classes in most games, decided to go for a DPS instead this time.
---
Shaman may come as caster dps and also want HoJ.
---
To each each own, some people prefer to play as underrepresented faction: actually that's kinda fun if you have a pvp-oriented guild, you just get your raid then steamroll enemy gankers which groups are like 10-20 ppl, then change your location fast while they cry and ask for help in the location you have already left. Since enemy faction is 80 to 20 compared to yours, you will always have your fresh meat no matter where you go.
---
Keep in mind the stickies are all pretty solid.  The random people discussing stuff is basically read at your own risk.  Everyones raid is at different stages so what is beneficial to one raid might not be helpful to others.  Just keep an open mind and you will be fine and don't feel too bad if you happen to be a Tauren.
---
Battlegrounds are confirmed crossrealm so queue times will be universal in each region.
---
You would probly feel different if you were 50ish and not a rogue.  Thats what most people are complaining about
---
I enjoy phase 2 and i do not in anyway use exploits like this.
---
I’m 53 and will most likely hit 60 soon, casual leveler and hard to quest now but that’s not why I’m here - is there some sort of guide to follow once you hit 60 to see what needs to be done? Like a checklist? This is all new to me :)
---
Talents, too. This time back in vanilla my 31 point survival talent was lacerate. Not to mention rhok delar not being out, yet.
---
Thanks for proving my point, now you can go back to retail since it definitely suits you more.
---
"horde will have bad queues haha u horde suck alliance win!!"
---
"nu uh its balanced we wont have queues"
---
"who cares about queues ill watch netflix"
---
Your xp bar is tiny. TINY!
---
Yes, which will be classic+ or TBC. Not classic.
---
There is no risk in wow except for maybe your time. The worst thing that can happen is a group of players comes and camps you for 30 minutes for killing there low lvl friend. To kill those low levels in runescape you have to be in risky areas. Pretty much all pvp games have elements of risk (ranks, mmr, items) that wow pvp does not have.
---
Left handed here so 1-6, CTRL;ALT, SHIFT, F Key all +1-6 as well
---
It gets more fun when it's loot related, get declined for pug groups all the time because I'm a warrior DPS, even though I have near full BiS and running dungeons now for greens to DE and gold. It brings me some slight pleasure when I get declined for  UBRS group and they sit in LFG Looking for a caster DPS with a seal, which I have. Good thing I got a guild now.
---
Shout out to all the druids who invite me to groups though, you're the real ones &lt;3
---
Or you can not accept it and quit it, feel free to.
---
Why is alliance so bad in TBC? Bcoz blood elf racial?
---
I love phase 2 and I'm mostly levelling an alt on the weaker faction right now. Outside of this subreddit the general consensus seems to be quite positive, atleast on the servers I play on. A few dicks here and there, sure, but all in all lots of good sportsmanship from both sides.
---
For 80/20 servers? Yeah, that sucks. But so many people here are just constantly circlejerking.
---
You guys still don't seem to realize that you're nothing more than a vocal minority.
---
Exorsus Raid Tools.
---
It's baffling that he's made like 10 comments to 6 different people about this without grasping this simple concept.
---
just long fingers my friend, long long man
---
Yeah, taking a #nochanges approach reminds me of talking to a freshman libertarian. 
---
"oh, so you just want to throw MORE government at it?" whenever someone wants a stupid law or regulation fixed/modified.
---
It hasnt even been a week..
---
Big LC energy
---
The only one that is somewhat hard, Imo, is Solenor. And even then he's not that hard. I got him to 50% with no fear immunity on my first and only try, then he bugged out and dropped combat. Shadow protect is definitely good to have, just in case. There was an alliance hunter there also doing it so I had to wait but ended up finishing it in the cheesiest way possible, I was able to loot the head after she had killed it. Maybe it was karma for mine bugging out and her using fear immunity.
---
Artorius: outrange, maintain serpent sting and use rank 1 arcane shot on CD. Avoid mobs.
---
Selene: trap her, kill the pet. Afterwards melee and use wing clip rank 1 to maintain viper sting.
---
Klinfran: Burst at first then scorpid sting once he enrages, wing clip once sting has 8 seconds left and repeat.
---
Klinfran was buggy for me but very easy once he worked. The absolutely hardest part about these quests are other players interfering, your faction or the opposite. I recommend making a yell macro to keep them at bay.
---
Shaggy on too many Scooby Snaks?
---
The crafting plans are sourced from world bosses. Given enough time (and if your faction has a bit of luck) they'll drop soon enough and someone on your faction will announce that they have the craft.
---
If the plans end up in the hands of the opposing faction you could try to reach out to players on your realm discord and ask them to craft and sell it to you via the neutral AH.
---
[Some reading for you.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player)
---
lmao dude queues have been in the game since BGs came out, they're nothing new. I waited in BC, WOTLK, MOP, Cata, WoD and Legion. It's no different. Horde have always had longer queues than Alliance as more people on Horde care about pvp than Alliance.
---
nothing will change the imbalance unless they make racials irrelevant (i.e. making them insignificant like +15 to profession skill or 10 to some resistance)
---
\#nochanges will be the death of classic
---
Thank you! I’m only level 58 so I’ll be using it too at some point... hopefully lol
---
yeah this is a terrible terrible idea. 
---
don't get me wrong its a great idea and the website looks awesome but hindsight is a beautiful thing. 
---
if this grows it will promote the min/max culture even more and could destroy the community. 
---
no more gearscore
---
Ugh, this is still so aggravating. I respecced out of entrapment, why even waste the talent points when you can't trap?
---
I mean, we use Vanas KoS as a shared guild blacklist and it doesn't take extreme stuff to get on it. Funnily enough we still manage to find people for our groups.
---
Thanks!
---
Aha! Good to know! I never tried changing weapons in combat, i'm a mage after all...
---
if healers get agro before a dps caster, that's not conflicted ;)
---
Gives you a very thoughtful and civil argument in response to your childish, emotional  fantasy of 'Making someone's year' 
---
You:   I do always love how people try and rationalise their bullshit.
---
Yeah it sucks. But it's free.
---
One walking simulator to another..
---
the way to do it is thus:
---
be tank
---
get a mage or warlock (ez, they need banthok)
---
promise healer all un-needed blues.
---
As a mage you can do the reverse thing.
---
I don't think BGs will solve the problem. The overpopulation compared to original vanilla is the true culprit. Layer would be nice. That way you run into multiple gank squads every couple minutes.
---
That sounds exhausting.
---
Is it petty? Why would you want to play with someone whose straight up unkind?
---
Golden Times represent!
---
It was a shit show. Obviously.
---
It was around as Paranoia in vanilla and it didn’t kill that. I’m not a big fan either but you’re completely overreacting and also giving the addon a very nice advertisement. It’s not going anywhere. It can’t without breaking other addons unless they totally change the way addons work which isn’t happening either. Also the way you think the addon is going to play out in BGs is wrong.
---
I know that Elvui has this function. Not sure if there is a separate add on that does it.
---
It's back and working
---
no one gives a shit about your guild
---
It's not as fun as a full dungeon run but as a healer you could heal a brd aoe farm. 54 is perfect. As a mage that's literally the only way I've been able to get from 57 to 59 right now.
---
Oh dear :)
---
&gt;I think the weapon enchants you always use the one that has most recently been upgraded a Level.
---
Oh god, I've never even thought about that.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Priest here, even with BRE warriors barely get through my shield before they die. If you pop reck I'll pop LIP and it'll be even more one-sided.
---
Wipe, reset and enter the instance again. If you want to farm Princess, use the purple portal to revive, exit and go to the portal room again.
---
Thought battle/zerker was only 70% threat gen (-30%)?
---
I don't think the retail community is particularly toxic. They're not the most social bunch but I wouldn't call being quiet toxic and partly the fault lies with the way the game is designed, you're not exactly encouraged to talk to people.
---
Hello, traveler from the future. Please tell us about how phase 4 is going?
---
As far as being a 1h+ shield build, you are the most effecient leveling spec. 
---
Shamans have by far the most about of skills they can use as a class. So it's important to only purchase and upgrade the skills that will offer the most utility to you as you level. You don't need every totem, and don't need every skill. To help keep things simple and easy, while also keeping you mana effecient, and saving some gold with it as well: generally want to use strength of Earth, stoneskin, and tremor totem, you'll use your flametounge totem and fire Nova. For water you'll want your healing stream, and when you get it mana spring totem. Air you'll really only need grace of air, and windfury. Other than that you'll need a few spells to help out because you can't JUST be totems only. I recommend getting earth shock (also keep an extra earth shock rank 1 on your bar to use as a low cost interrupt), fire shock, and frost shock is all I've used while leveling. And if you plan to stay the course of leveling as enhancement, you'll not need to worry too much about chain lightning since you'll only be doing lightning bolt to pull mobs for the most part. If you plan on doing dungeons to supplement your leveling experience, I recommend keeping up with your healing spells upgrades, since if you can't dps/side tank, you can still heal. Helps keep you useful on all fronts. ((Also make friends with mages and you'll probably be able to get a hold of conjured food/water for cheap/free, so much cheaper than getting off the stores)) keep up with all your secondary professions, (yes including first aid even though you can heal) and for primary professions what I did (you don't have to follow this) was LW and skinning. Helped me with keeping my armour the best I could get as I leveled, until I hit 40. Then with the money I made from skinning (believe me you'll do so much skinning your leatherworking won't be able to keep up with you) I got my mount, from there you'll want to drop them both and grab mining/blacksmith. I did weaponsmithing so I can craft 2h weapons to help me raid as enhancement, for things like arcanite reaper or nightfall.
---
dont go into the bug hives its a rogue war zone for the rich nodes.
---
Just throw it up for whatever *you* think it's worth. Remember - you determine the value, but the customer decides how much it's worth. So just see how far it'll go. Hell, start the auction at (for example) 500g and just let people bid? Then lower the starting bid till it starts getting bid on.
---
I'm already doing that but there's a lot of PvP going on there so right now it's hard to farm
---
If you have two accounts, invite your 2nd character into a group and use the 2nd character to reset for yourself. Your main character needs to be offline while you reset with your alt.
---
If you don't have two accounts, have a friend invite you and a level 1 alt that you made specifically to reset dungeons into a group. Ask him to leave the group and pass lead to your main character. Once it's time to reset, log out of your main character and log onto the alt. After two minutes the game will automatically pass leader to your level 1 alt and you'll be able to reset the dungeon. Two minutes after logout your main character will inherit leader once more.
---
&gt; I don't think salvation is that much better
---
Sorry but what you THINK is irrelevant. You’re a 100% wrong, salvation breaks the game quite literally. Your DPS will also have WF so it doesn’t really do that much.
---
DPSers (especially in BWL where so many fights have threat reducing abilities) will be able to do way more damage without getting aggro as alliance.
---
All I hear you saying is "finding two people to play with is TOO HARD! Make everything soloable, please. Including pvp."
---
Upvote for not hiding names like most idiots on this sub!
---
Timeless Isle was very challenging if you pulled more than a few mobs. Pulling 10 "asian taurens" with a cone AoE that will one-shot you was definitely entertaining.
---
i laughed so hard, thanks
---
Come to benediction where slightly outnumbered alliance side.
---
You are talking out of your ass. 30% less threat generated permanently is not just slightly better than a 20% chance on an extra aa.
---
Then probably your best bet is to farm gold from instanced content where there's no PvP. If you don't wish to sell tank service or do an orb res run I'm not sure there are a lot of ways to make gold efficiently as a tank.
---
All these memes are so stale and dumb. Can we have something clever? The whole boomer thing doesnt even make any sense. Do people know what a boomer even is?
---
You even gave evidence for it yourself.
---
&gt; Also alliance has a much lower number of warlocks than horde BECAUSE of this racial 
---
Stoneform isn't even close to being as oppressive as WOTF is. Horde does not have fewer Rogues than Alliance. Because Stoneform doesn't keep anyone from trying to be a Rogue. Unlike what WOTF does to WL/Priest.
---
Thats what I ment.
---
I have wondered for long why this even happened. Unfortunately I do not have source right now but I am pretty sure that in one Q&amp;A Ion did say something about how there is no actual technical limitation on player count in one realm. Back in Vanilla days technology wasn't like now so they simply had to limit player count. A lot of game design decisions (spawn rates, amount of resources etc) are what they are based on that there will never be 10k player at same time roaming around the world. Ion did mention that they are going to limit player count because it is not technical but game design choice.
---
After all this have been said it makes me wonder.. why in earth they didn't limit player cap more closely to Vanilla days. It is clearly way too high currently. Saying people "please migrate to lower population server" does not work as a lot of community relations have already been established.
---
i was in a horde group in darkshire earlier and they were murdering lowbies to try and get the 60s to come out I tryed to warn them and tell them to flee but it was to late for most of em sadly :( i dont like killing super lowbies one little gnome got away in Redridge tho! gave me a hug and everything as he fled away.
---
Have to add in 2005 there were far fewer players per server, no servers were as dramatically skewed as some of the realms today (heartseeker, skeram, stalagg), and most people didn't use an addon like spy.  Those 3 things are the main contributors to world PvP being a nightmare on certain servers.  People have always cared about ranking despite what the rewards are just for the prestige.  There were far more "PvP focused" guilds back then than there are today.
---
FAP doesn't prevent sap. Though if you pop it before the rogue reveals, he'd just wait it out.
---
We're you a dick for trying to clairify something you expected was the intent of the agreement? Nah.
---
We're you a dick if you tries to change the agreement? Ya.
---
Should you have expected this kind of response from him either way? For sure. You agreed to terms with 4 other people and tried to change them once everyone was invested.
---
You got blacklisted for being (in his mind) a waste of time. Honestly, I'd have blacklisted you, even if I would have agreed to the terms if you had mention need them up front. Last minute changes like that are shitty, and tell me I don't want to to group with that person again. Sure, this time it might not matter, but next time it might.
---
Also, why not need on the backpack since it's a green you could use?
---
Mograine was 51-49 ally/horde last time they released the statistics, can happily say as a Horde player, it's a constant flip from who holds whatever zone. Although, alliance tend to travel in packs of 3+ so I rarely find 1v1 scenarios :(
---
invited a 60 warrior to arena runs on my 58 warrior tank. Decided to kill some trash (i Queue with a healer buddy) and the guy was RAAAAAGING. 'I didn't come here to waste my damn time' etc etc.
---
Was very close to kicking him but didn't. Savage chain dropped, I need rolled 5, he need rolled 63 :(
---
Yeah my bad. Though you ment they added it after Vanilla
---
50iq class own in a 1vs10 with only 4 spells pressed!
---
Barbarous Blade works just as well as Demonslayer.
---
Priest or Mage loot are the only thing that ever drop in MC, what do you mean :(
---
Since BG's will be crossrealm, and since there should be between 50 and 500 bg's going all the time. To calculate the queue time do, (overall horde percentage / overall alliance percentage-1)\*average BG game time.
---
So if the servers are 66% horde and 33% alliance, and if the average BG game time is 15 minutes, it would be (66/33-1)\*15. So 15 minutes.
---
Since the BG's will also include the PvE servers, and since some PvP servers are alliance-majority, then across all servers the ratio is between 55:45 and 60:40. Which means somewhere between 3.3 and 7.5 minute queue times. Which isn't enough time to do anything.
---
As another poster mentioned though, premades are going to be the next major issue. I'm hoping Blizzard doesn't allow full premades to queue against pugs. Maybe 3-4 people in your group before it pushes you off into the premade queue system. And if you don't take your queue when it pops it should give you deserter.
---
In classic the premades play like 80% of the total games in a day, and all they want to do is rolfstomp pugs and dodge each other so they can go back to roflstomping pugs.
---
Dont agree to loot rules you dont want to agree to and wait till the run is already going and everyone has pvp'ed their way through blackrock mountain to start talking about it. That's on you for wasting everyone's time.
---
Oh yes ofcourse, male dps
---
They have, but it’s still a bannable offense to communicate with the other faction by manipulating the in game translator.
---
Hey pssst, don\`t make this in something it isnt. Douchebags are on both sides. Blame Blizztard for not limiting faction numbers. The only issue is the faction imbalance, not the people playing either side.
---
Its really not because most people just go after the "BiS-list" no matter their race. And all bis-lists have gear that give atleast 9%hit.
---
Form a party with a friend that is not in the dungeon and ask them to reset all dungeons once you log out
---
Or
---
Form a party with a friend, log out and log into an alt. 
---
Have friend inv alt, friend can drop group. 
---
Swap to alt once your run is done and reset all dungeons.
---
HAVE A HAPPY CAKEDAY FUCK FACE!
---
I used to hibernate druids in travel form and hunter pets from up there before it became a big thing. It was pretty fun, had some nice little brawls break out on top of the roof
---
I think Mara is a lot more stressful, at least the final boss. DM is just too much gold to pass.
---
Rockbiter is the one to go btw. Not windfury.
---
eh Fairbanks has packs of alli that will run in kill a bunch of ppl then run out basically unscathed because horde wont want to defend UC for some reason
---
That's a thing? I've done BRD arena. Could do Angerforge if he dropped anything good.
---
Should look into Blockada and YouTube Vanced, haven't seen a single ad on anything since I downloaded them, even movies on those sketchy movie streaming sites try to redirect you to 5 different sites but the videos just play instantly.
---
Big ol F in the chat bois  
---
F
---
Tank service with orb res it's seen as normal then? Yes, thats why I was thinking on leveling a mage or hunter because they shine as instance farming
---
I use spy because its fucking broken. I wish it were banned because its oppressive especially on classes with AI pet to show you where the people are. Until its banned what choice do we have but to use it for our own protection?
---
You obviously don't understand the problem. If the world was included in the ratio and would increase in size with increased population **you would be correct**. I put that in bold for you.
---
What?  You don't want every los pull immediately fucked up by some charging dipshit who repeatedly goes, "my bad" and yet does it on the next pull?!!
---
Think Hunter using Multi-Shot as an opener is annoying?  Obviously you've never met a DPS Warrior using Whirlwind before you even get to the mobs.
---
Don't you want a class that brings no utility to the group whatsoever...and rolls on your tank gear?  What a deal, amirite?
---
DPS Warriors have always been the biggest joke in 5-mans in Vanilla.  They can't even calm the fuck down and get carried by a real tank, so desperate to prove they are viable DPS that they become more annoying than any other DPS you could bring.
---
Well, you taught me something new today.
---
Just gotta have a good TV-show on the other monitor.
---
Hey I've seen that one.. respect that you are able to pull it of. What is your Ms while playing? Sometimes it looks like my zombies has more range than yours.
---
Where is baby Yoda when you need him?
---
&gt; After 4-6 weeks ..
---
Given the staggering of phases we'll probably have Battlegrounds by then anyway
---
I have a priest and always wonder what level I can respec holy &amp; start hitting dungeons at as questing is a nightmare in p2! Any tips? I've heard 52 for BRD and 57-58 for everything else :P
---
Just use nature prots vs Simone, they're not expensive.
---
Klinfran just wait for enrage, scorpid sting and melee him until scorpid sting has 8 seconds left or so. Once it does wing clip, wait for enrage, reapply sting and repeat. 100% foolproof.
---
I totally believe that for certain hardcore players in BiS in Alliance, it can be fun to make group of 5-10 and hunt all of the horde players who didn't bother to make a raid. 
---
Now for the 48-59 players, for the Horde players who must search endlessly for something to fight that is not already being camped, for non-hardcore alliance players who don't have the friend network nor the time to always group and get killed and camped relentlessly at each FP, for anyone who expected world pvp to be somewhat fair because some people pretended that world PvP in vanilla was perfect then it's not fun.
---
In the end, I guess that people having fun can say "cry more, go pve" but in you look a bit more long term, it's the corner stone of classic: many people will leave if they are not having fun and server will become just a niche of hardcore players and Blizzard will think: "they thought they did but they didn't"
---
Well in P1 no one was complaining about BRM being camped to the point that you cant even do Jed/Rend runs due to a massive party of people camping outside.  
---
All it took was a few pixels saying "Honors points" to release the demon blood
---
\^this
---
just find a warrior and do duo dm:east farming. Thats the best gold you can make. An easy 60/g hour for each.
---
Some people actually enjoy the world war in WoW and the blood bath.
---
I'm on a lower pop server which has its perks - people are much less picky :)
---
My atlas loot addon says blue pvp set won't even come until p5. Is that right?
---
I'd like to give them the benefit of the diubt and hope that they were talking about brackets.....but it seema unlikely
---
that's completely normal and has nothing to do with layers. just unfortunate timing. someone looted it like 10 minutes prior to you coming there, but not fully so it didn't despawn immediately.
---
This is what happens when you poke a bear with a stick.
---
Or at least one person in the group who can actually CC something!  Has anyone in this game yet to meet a hunter than double trap CC a target?  Most won't even offer to put down the initial trap.  Most Rogues are not Imp. Sap spec'ed.  Warlocks don't know how to toggle fear and Recklessness.  The other "DPS" classes out there have nothing to offer except Shadow Priests with Shackle but that's usually only good for Scholo and Strat.
---
Well to be fair when honor was first introduced it was the "old" PvP sets which I don't think quite matched up with epic gear.  The updated blues are now on par and the epic pvp gear is almost AQ40 tier.  They didn't want to make PvP pointless so they made it possibly over the top important since it is released so longer in advance of PvE-equivalent gear.
---
Exatcly, we 3 manned BRD arena runs when I was healing at lvl 49
---
Why would horde quit the game though? If queues are too long they can servertransfer. Alliance is being held hostage on the server and can't do anything.
---
Icy veins and wow head are all saying tanks should go full mit and have no regard for hit rating or threat at all, and fury guides ignoring really good options like voone's vice grips and arms guides ignoring warblade of caer darrow- just so many rampant oversights
---
are the players who pop out of nowhere rogues?
---
We got like 3 priests with at least 5 part T1 and T2 helm/legs. Honestly the only shit that drops.
---
I feel your pain. Ally here though. I was on a farm in WPL, and out of the blue, a group of 60s came and obliterated me.
---
I guess this is like a forced break. I feel bad for giving them free honor.
---
Because flying.
---
It's a must have in my guild. Life is much simpler with it.
---
What's your SFK farm about?
---
People that "farmed so much honor" probably got 40k in hillsbrad :D
---
I figured!
---
I respecced to prot at level 55, soloing was anyway so slow that it was not worth doing as arms.
---
Tanking dungeons became way smoother as prot than as arms.
---
ok, always have rockbiter on your weapon. As it does great damage. Frostband is kinds pointless as you have frostshock to slow enemies too.  
---
At your level, pretty much just drop magma totem over Fire nova when killing mobs, as fire nova you need to be careful of the range as it could tag other patrols if doing instances.  
---
Stoneclaw is great if you have 2 mobs attacking you. One will be distracted to fight this totem. Its is great when you pull too many mobs. 
---
I never bothered with resit totems till Black rock mountain, and even then just for UBRS for Drakk.
---
Oh youre approaching me?
---
WoW classic redditors be like 
---
Loll imagine wiping on onyxia rofl we did it with my guild week 1 with 10 people lol so ez cunt learn to play
---
Datamined gear shows the set isn't available though.
---
I think that's fair. Granted you could have people log in on alts and invite themselves, but only a minority would go through that trouble so it stems the tide somewhat (which is more than Blizzard is doing at the moment).
---
&gt; 1) doesn't seem very realistic for a game called world of warcraft.... terrain exploiting is how wars are fought. 
---
Well Blizzard clearly had a more even playing field in mind when designing the game and it's ToS. You might not like it but you will need to follow it or be punished.
---
Sorry but you just described the younger generation.. just without the old people.
---
During thursday we ran through WPL back and forth a couple of times and destroyed any Alliance we could find, and every time we got to chillwind camp it was already squashed by a different raid of hordes.
---
Haven't been there since then though
---
Rattlegore feels the same. Boats are off limits and filled with 15+ level 60 horde at any moment, entire towns are dead, no gryphon master to even leave. If your hearthstone is on CD you just get to book it like you're a level 8 NE all over again or log out.
---
&gt; I get camped by 10+ alliance daily when I'm farming herbs for my epic mount. 
---
The fact that you actually are able to farm herbs tells us that you don't get it
---
mine sold for 10g, don't know who would've bought it tho
---
(for comparison: arcane crytals are at 50g, black lotus at 70g, mooncloth at 20g here)
---
That's correct, wpvp was created for the purpose of ganking, it's good you enjoy this game the way it was intended.
---
Happy to see the true vanilla spirit back in the community.
---
Go read a bit more on the topic my guy.
---
Yes, it is easy to farm, problem is that they dont drop that many things
---
Hold on, are you saying you DIDNT get corpse ganked by a 100 player raid of fully geared 60's???? THat doesnt seem to match what people are telling me on this subreddit. 
---
You also had fun? I call bullshit.
---
Seriously tho, people are so drawn to negativity, every post like these is drowned by 17 post of "this sucks, i got ganked for 92 hours in a row"
---
What would Jesus' name be if it were a female?
---
Week 1 is probably going to be around 150k (depends on the server ofc), but once people hit higher ranks you'll also earn a lot more.
---
He spend his rare free hours to have fun.
---
I am using Ringmenu :)
---
Yes I also tought about this but I dont know anyone in my server and you depend on another one to do this kind of farm
---
I rather horde leave the server and have a balanced server. As compared to the long term repercussions of a huge faction imbalance - a server with no alliance and ultimately a dead server.
---
Mauradon is really good, go to goblin boss kill him, and kill all the earth elementals on the way. There are also some pacs on the way to princess, if u got mining its even better
---
I got 20 ms and seem to get hit from ranges bigger than in your video, but it looks like I'm just bad than :)
---
Killing yourself and corpse running **is not** the quickest way to reset the instance. The best way to do it is to have an alt and do it the way described in posts below.
---
Dominos, leatrix plus, ringmenu, details.. are the main ones :)
---
&gt; It is just a jump up the south wall to reset bosses if one you don't need spawns to reset and run back out through the prison area.
---
What again? How do you reset unneded bosses? oO
---
You could farm SFK.
---
You can get very lucky with rare Drops that are worth loads.
---
But also the green Drops with the right stats tend to sell quite well. Especially now that People start making twinks because Level 60 pvp is unplayable for a lot of People.
---
I got lucky and got shadowfang on my 2nd try :P
---
No its not, you overexagrerating victim mentality players
---
Someone that can link me the Paladin Discord? The link here it's outdated :X, i'd appreciate it please!
---
Adding bgs won't stop horde from world pvping. Horde ques will be 2 hours,  where do you think they will go?
---
P2 separates the boys from the men.
---
Interesting! Is princess doable also? You habe any guide or video for this?
---
You can get to rank 10 with 5 hours a week....
---
'Out of range of guards' is not the issue. Can you aggro a guard and make him follow you up there? Not a problem! 
---
When you aggro a guard and he resets as soon as you get up there? That's a problem!
---
I'm an ass guy myself.
---
Was thinking more like in duels, cant use FAP then
---
Shamans generally don't snipe, at least not on purpose in case they do what they should be doing, which is mostly Chain Healing. 2.5 sec casts hardly count as a snipe! LHW is to try and save someone from dying, or I guess, to pad the meters. 
---
If you see them casting on a melee, you can assume that the other two most wounded nearby players will also be healed for a certain amount. Priests (or Paladins, I suppose), now those are snipy!
---
Makes even more sense then, if the pvp release back in the day had little to no incentive other then the prestige.
---
IIRC even back in the day people knew rank 14 was only achievable by the top 1%.
---
Well it all depends on what you want to do. Once you hit 60, there isn't really a next step. The game is pretty open ended.
---
What do you want to do?
---
## Raiding?
---
Look up the BiS PvE list for your class. This is basically the list of items which are "Best In Slot" (BiS) for dealing as much damage as you can in Raids, currently just Molten Core and Onyxia (well I guess the outdoor world bosses too). Look at which dungeons these items are in or what quest lines they come from and start working on acquiring this gear.
---
## PvP?
---
Again look up a BiS slot guide for your class. PvP and PvE gear are pretty different and you may end up with completely different sets for both. Once you feel geared enough (or whenever you want really, you could start at 60) join PvP groups and go start some fights.   
---
This can be just for fun, or to get ranking to buy the PvP gear.
---
## Other?
---
- Grind gold your epic mount   
---
- Level up your professions and go looking for rare patterns   
---
- Grind reputation for a different mount type   
---
- Sit around in Orgrimmar/Ironforge and gamble
---
Final note: You don't need to wait till 60 to start gathering your BiS gear. For example a lot of BiS gear comes from BRD, which you could start running now.
---
Invisible walls aren't that hard to implement. But to put them in every little spot which could exploited in that way? That would require a lot of work and as you say ruin a lot of the exploration aspect of the game.
---
The way they handle it now, works rather well. So why change?
---
its minimal. pick pocketing the arena audience in BRD is pretty profitable, but does get boring. There are so many mobs so close together.
---
S1 arena was druid warrior vs druid warrior all over at high ranks. Arena really puts a dent in the theory that a Paladin's support is all that awesome, because they were by far the worst healer, due to how easily CCable they are while extremely susceptible to counterspell.
---
Jumping up the south wall of the arena(the one directly to the right after you jump down) makes them go on evade, just hit them and then jump up there and wait for them to reset. They usually take 20 seconds or so to reset, only the worgen takes longer because he keeps casting his bubble.
---
Never met anyone being "toxic" in classic wow. And ive wiped 10+ times in same grp with random people. We all complained but in the end we finished and had a laugh at how stupid we where.
---
If it smells like shit everywhere you go, check you shoe
---
Honestly with how gamers these days are I really can't see how people thought selecting a server where you would be a constantly respawning resource node would be a good idea.
---
120+ if lot of competition
---
Adding bgs won't do anything,  horde ques will be 2 hours. Where do you think they will go in the mean time?
---
It does give you attack speed though?
---
But you made the evidence sound SO compelling in your post. You forgot a link for the “stupid wow head survey” though. 
---
You only provided a link for the opt-in only guild reporting which you admitted not everyone used. If you try to be realistic it’s like &lt;10% of players accounted for on there.
---
I've definitely seen players layer away after the 12th, blizz is bullshitting us yet again and it's sad to say but I'm not even surprised
---
Yeah and you are holding the horde who cant log in hostage by trying to add that shit. You chose that server and cant log in cause server balance, tell me how is that the players fault? Why should you lock them from logging in cause of that when we spent money monthly and chose that server. Why would we just transfer out to cater to you when we have guilds, friends all on said server?
---
And as we see here, Blizzard doesn't pull out the ban hammer right away but just orders people to get off and not do that.
---
I 2manned this for a friend (me heal, he warrior) and I don't see how I would ever help someone farm that shit for dozens of times who I don't know. People are fucking idiots.
---
If you want to monetarily compensate me for helping you farm your crap and we're not friends, give me gold per run and not only if it drops. Fucking imbeciles.
---
holy shit this is some new levels of pathetic :D
---
It’s so annoying. LITERALLY IN LEVEL 30 DUNGEONS.
---
Test it. Do an hour ZF and an hour BRD and you’ll have your answer. BRD should be 35-40g an hour. I doubt ZF will come close to that.
---
Dreadmist
---
Yeah it gets really hard after like 1-2am.
---
Alright there's already 3 ghost-jokes on the frontpage, calm down
---
Even if Horde leave the server, according to census it was 60-65% horde to begin with.  Unless you make Heartseeker go from 90A/10H to 90H/10A with mass transfers Stalagg and Skeram wont get anywhere near 50/50 without Horde quitting or rerolling.  You basically want to make the Horde miserable so alliance have a good time (makes sense for you I guess, just like I don't want to be unable to play the game on my main anymore).
---
If you’re already geared, there is no incentive to show up and raid anyway.
---
I heard on pservers they had GMs monitoring that place 24/7, instantly banning players that try to interfere.
---
Hi, /u/Fb62
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyiysl/to_the_alliance_of_herod_who_killed_azuregos/). 
---
But vanilla WoW didn’t have it fixed in code so Classic won’t have either. Just like these things were solved by GMs coming in back in the day, they will be solved now
---
Pvp is a literal term, and thats literally pvp, wether you like it or not
---
The majority is playing horde though, this is the key source of the issue: horde vastly outnumbers alliance on most of the servers 70 to 30 or 80 to 20 even. This makes 80 percent (of gankers or just people who don't care about wpvp and mind their business) happy and makes about 5% unhappy (just a slight estimation of a ganked faction minus those who transfer to other servers or simply raidlog). Who are a minority and won't make a difference even if they quit.
---
&gt; And yes its petty
---
Both herod guild blacklists i've seen have been
---
nothing but scammers, ninjas, and outright toxic shitters.
---
I know the exact aggro range of level 60s, aggro range is the primary reason for not bringing in a lower level imo.
---
well 1% of the player base is much more on a 15k server, than on a 3k server.
---
 Thank you. I was looking for it.
---
we get like one full mage t1 set per mc run and barely any other loot
---
Yeah there’s some weird phasing going on. Who knows what Blizzard is up to.
---
That's overall population, you have to filter by server.
---
Since that site started tracking population, Alliance peaked at 2731 concurrent players on Herod compared to 5249 for Horde.
---
For the past ~week Horde has a steady 2800-3000 concurrent players online whereas Alliance has anywhere from 300-2400.
---
Someone should have told the GM to stop telling them to do it and start issuing temporary bans.
---
Yeah that should work.
---
and pvp servers are 80% of the servers.
---
I'm not joking. For the english alone, it's 16 pvp servers against 4 pve.
---
Just reset via logging out and having a sixth person/a alt press reset while you are offline next time.
---
i had the logitech g500 with 12 buttons on the side but rly felt awkward to use... (it was 36 binds with shift and control modifier)
---
"Q" and "E" to straffe, 
---
1 to 5 with shift modifier
---
shift "Q" shift "E"
---
F+R+T+G+V+C with shift modifier
---
mouse button 4 and 5 with shift + alt + control modifier
---
also, jump is your friend to use some keybinds while keep running forward and stuff.
---
Just farmed ZF for about a day, payed off both the pattern and the mats. Not worth grinding either imo.
---
Thanks. I mean logically it makes sense, but I'm not the best macro maker.
---
Thats because their HKs come from big aoe fights, tagging with multishot/blizzard etc. 2 honor per kill doesn't exactly yield alot of honor.
---
Dishonorable kills are minus 100 RP(rank points) instantly, which we have none of.
---
I was just looking at an MMO-Champ post where someone asked for a taunt for paladins to be added and a ton of people just came in to basically say "#nochanges" but in a way that jut sounded vile and spiteful.
---
Retailers coming to classic threads and gloating over the problems the game has (like that somehow makes retail better) is just so pathetic.
---
I love Vanilla itemization. I LOVE the fact that Dungeons stay relevant. Unlike retail, where you run like 5 heroic dungeons at the start of the expansion for like 5 interchangable super boring items and then go on to other content.
---
Classic? Righetous Orbs, Pristine Black Diamonds, Skin of Shadow, Abomination Stitching and other items along with gear that isn't just "higher level dungeon = better gear, so forget doing anything but UBRS/Scholo/Strat for items make sure that content stays relevant.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Retail itemization is so absurdly boring and one-dimensional. All items are exactly the same (mainstat, stam, 2 secondary stats) and there is absolutely no need to ever get multiple items (xcept trinkets for different specs) for the same slot for like ... resistances, high stamina, high burst or whatever.
---
One's gotta be really thick in their head to make an argument that farming a dungeon for a specific but awesome and rare drop is somehow worse than having the mega boring unified item experience retail delivers. Itemization in retail is just extremely bland and boring.
---
It won't stay this way, longer fights are coming.
---
Oooh you approaching me?
---
This was the first place we raided just after honor system came online. We didn't camp it though, just levelled the place and left after like 2 minutes.
---
Well you got something really wrong here....first I am a mage with a full frost spec (read AOE farming), second I took two gathering professions, never ever spent money on the AH always sold stuff (no engineering). And beside this, I also know few things about auctioning using Trade Skill Master. Not that I had money for the epic at lvl 60 I had around 160g left.... This is off-topic talk, but maybe you learn something out of it....
---
That is fine
---
My Night Elf Druid is level 30, I head to Hillsbrad Fields or the Yeti Cave and have had some epic 1v1s or small skirmishes appropriate to my level.  Just stay away from the hot zone between Southshore &amp; Tarren Mill
---
That is, until a horde cries and a bunch of 60s pile down on me.
---
The big graveyard in Duskwood has the same problem with Horde visiting.  I got absolutely destroyed by a lvl 19 twink a couple of days ago!!!  Ashenvale is also great at lower levels.
---
Alliance have no flight point in Stv except in boot bay
---
Probably the other way around, move the big zergs from me and others away into BG ^^
---
Hahaha good one 10/10 for effort. You almost got me there.
---
It breaks the game, sorry scrub
---
We have 2 raid groups each week and for 9 weeks we got 0 mageblade, i went for the staff aswell. Everyone dont have that luck to get mageblade. T2 mage legs dropped 4 weeks in a row in my group tho
---
Hahahaha I feel you bro 😎😎 I have hand of rag and fully BIS raid gear and me and my guildies like to hang out in early lvl 50 zones and hunt down those lowbobs. It’s their fault that they are not 60 yet and have no legendaries. They should leave their partners and and abandon their children if they want to play this game 😂😂😂
---
This truly is the greatest achievement and feels so rewarding when I hit that clothie just after he fought 2 mobs and has 30% health left 🔥🔥 and then I spawn camp him for half an hour, that is such a great honor/hour ratio as well
---
He's using evocation after spending all his mana conjuring delicious purified water.
---
 [https://legacyplayers.com/](https://legacyplayers.com/)  this was for PS. imo much better. check!
---
That is literally like your mates mum heard all the  commotion and has come upstairs waving her slipper about telling you to get down from the top of the cupboard, or else!
---
In hindsight I would've used an authenticator and this wouldn't happen.
---
You can check the restoration page for items or contact a GM (which I assume he already did).
---
&gt; advancedinterfaceoptions
---
Got it now, thanks mate! :D
---
&gt;Reduced threat is so much more important than windfury ever could be
---
Then why dont shamans use tranquil air?
---
This was foretold by the message boards of old!
---
This is why i pussed out and rolled pve this time around. 
---
Sorry to hear about your pain. Know that it will get a little better once BGs come in P3. 
---
Till then grind dungeons and stay safe!
---
I know in retail they removed the option to have addons show icons above friendly name playes so I guess it is not possible
---
Was half his arm amputated?
---
Man Shaggy is epic now. Nice drawing!
---
I disagree: being on the 80% is not fun for PvP either: roaming for 15 minutes to find someone that is not already being camped is boring. Stomping on a 20 alliance raid when you are 60 is also not fun (or at least it will soon become )
---
I hit this moment yesterday and it felt great! Blink, Evocation, better water and Blizzard. Felt real nice!
---
There is a heightened sense of danger on PvP servers. That’s what I enjoyed about it. But mostly it’s dishonorable petty griefers. If people on pvp servers had a sense of honor and weren’t such cowards then it would be a viable way to spend my time. But I’d rather not be some lowlifes plaything and constantly be the one getting shit on because I’m not willing to stoop to their level.
---
It's not dying at all, 70% of your server population are having fun.
---
Also, what country are you in?
---
EU covers quite a few timezones. For example I'm based in the UK and there's pretty much nothing going on after midnight because everyone on mainland Europe is 1-2 hours ahead.
---
You should be able to find a group as a warrior in under 1 minute if you're tanking. Either you watch the lookingforgroup channel or you post into it. Even if you're alone you can do LFM Scholo dps healer as a tank because the hardest to find part of the group is you.
---
Aszhara is so beautiful, it's a shame there is next to nothing to do in there :(
---
Retail is so unbalanced because horde pretty much always had better racials starting in wotlk with trolls, only exception to this is for pvpers. Then in Legion you had the Tomb of Sargeras raid where you pretty much had no choice but to roll a goblin for their racial in order to kill mythic Kil'jaeden, which in turn created a domino effect. You most likely had to roll horde to join a mythic guild, then there were so few mythic players left on alliance so the casual players also rolled horde to have an easier time finding groups for mythic+ dungeons.
---
If you look at wowprogress, out of the world top 50 guilds there are 5 alliance guilds. Looking at server population, top 15 servers in EU has 3 alliance dominated servers, US has 4.
---
I did not change to horde in retail because I wanted to be horde, I did it because I eventually had no choice. Now in classic I'm playing alliance of course, and I think a lot of players from retail that changed from alliance to horde has gone back to alliance.
---
Also, blizzard favoring horde doesn't help the matter either.
---
Just wait like 2 days till people get bored or go level in dungeons, restarting is an overreaction ahahah
---
A lot of learning about new places that day..
---
2 hunters can keep two elites out of the equation for a very good portion of the fight by pulling and jumping down the ledge into a FD. If you're good on dps but low on tanks, this is the stray I'd recommend.
---
It's an old meme sir, but it checks out.
---
Yeah I guess I set that amount too low, you'd need to be in the 10k bracket every week to get there after decay, right? 
---
I didn't find any actual table for the 1.12 distribution (since the wiki says that the table it has is only for pre 1.12 and it allowed more players into the higher brackets in 1.12) but with some napkin math it seemed like being in the top 2-3% of your server meant you would get to that 10k per week. I'm on a pve server so there are a ton of casual people who get &lt;2k honour every week and few who actually get 5 digits so 40h MIGHT be possible but more than likely double that would be more accurate, 5x that if you are on a pvp server.
---
At level 10 there isn't any rez sickness - I did the same thing!
---
That's the problem.. Flying killed world pvp almost entirely.
---
Grid is fully functional and operational in all ways as far as I'm concerned; it's just a wall of error message spam which can bloat and spam the chat, making it annoying if someone is writing anything of importance at that time. 
---
I'll have to look into getting Swatter or some other addon I think - otherwise super happy that I found a working version of Grid - great unit frame addon in all ways. Added in mana bars yesterday and got rid of my SUF party frames to have a cleaner screen, might look into setting up Multibar (is that the name) today - currently I just display health deficit numbers (and of course, the emptying Grid-box) and Incoming Heals on a higher priority than health deficit.
---
Might be something on youtube not sure, i stop on the bridge before princess dont think she is doable as pala.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMhoZVtcoeqzo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVMhoZVtcoeqzo) . Balance is really bad talent tree imo. With this you can still spam your abilities and have feral charge. Plus swiftmend, natures grace and natures grasp. Plus its really viable for raiding besides the missing improved MOTW but you can get another druid to cast that. Last point could be put in whatever you like, i think i prefer the improved regrowth since its really good in PVP and has usage in pve situations too.
---
clearing AQ40 was so Overrated
---
Please fix your UI. My god that is messy, haha.
---
That’s the entire point, to prevent people from playing on that faction
---
imagine having to go through the game and select every house, make an area you can't attack from, and then test it.
---
Heartseeker is the most unbalanced server by far.
---
How works the resistence of some cc after you use it over and over agian in the same target?
---
The resistence vs that cc still high during the combat or it come back to normal after you stop to do that cc in the same target after some time?
---
Here's what I'm getting with some basic spreadsheet magic:
---
https://i.imgur.com/yHeD389.png
---
As others have said, that wouldn’t be easy code to write no doubt. Plus you have to identify the coordinates of each area where this mechanic would be implement. 
---
But beyond that, I think things like this are what add charm to Classic. Removing all possible scenarios where people can be shitheads makes the game feel more like a zoo than a real world.
---
Problem with druids is that you need a really good player to shine, when a half decent rogue kicks his ass in dps, let alone a really good rogue that can make a shit ton of dps more than the druid and still main tank a phisical dps boss for a while if the tank is incapacitated
---
Nope
---
They picked the wrong server and the wrong faction and now want to cry about it. Anyone with some foresight saw this coming a mile away. Maybe they should have planned ahead and thought about what phase 2 would look like before deciding. Giving in to this type of player is exactly what led to retail becoming the game it is now.
---
Claw is good for single target DPS and if you're not allowed to apply debuffs in raid environments. 
---
If you're in a group or soloplay, I'd suggest you use Screech.
---
Important note: just toggle the other ability, you're not using off. 
---
If you have both active at the same time you will never get a growl off. Depending on what's at the most left button on your pet action bar, it gets used first.
---
So if you have use this order:
---
1. Claw
---
2. Screech
---
3. Dive
---
4. Growl
---
It uses Claw over Screech over Dive over Growl. Growl and Dive (and also Screech) are rarely even cast.
---
I'd suggest you putting the more important abilities to the right, like:
---
1. Dive
---
2. Growl
---
3. Screech
---
4. Claw
---
TBH: I find Screech + Bite as a good combination, because your pet is not always focus starved, but still uses Bite on a regular basis.
---
I use: 
---
3. Bite
---
4. Screech
---
Yeah, and by doing that you lost a subscriber, well done
---
Princess is quite an easy kite. And the run is very low risk (most mobs won't aggro even at a very close range).
---
Get a Wind Serpent, put it on Stay in the middle of the circle and make it attack her with the lighting bolt.
---
It helps the DPS a lot. Just make sure to actually DPS her, and maybe use Distracting Shot to keep her from going near the pet and killing it with Dust Storm.
---
I haven't found the class what clicks for me so I reroll. Warr rogue druid pala. Currently lvling hunter.
---
I am not sure what do you mean: it's definitely playable for people who corpse camp, grief across every single flight path, zone and instance entrance. 
---
If you are on the side of the losing faction: sit in your capital and gather a raid or 15-20 ppl. Move out to the open world and crush these groups of 5 or even 10. Change your location immediately while they cry for help: when the help arrives, you won't be there for them to take revenge. Since your faction is outnumbered, you will always have some fresh meat to prey upon. Avoid obvious areas like BRM or DM entrance.
---
No, you should still be able to find groups for most content, it'll take a bit longer but it's really not that bad, may I ask what server do you play on
---
This so much this. I'm part of the younger generation too smfh.
---
Finding groups for stuff should not be hard at all. Not everyone is 60 yet, and those who are might well be leveling their alts right now (24 warlock here). If you're on a PvP realm you will see more PvP action though, whether you like it or not - but this can be solved by being a Rogue (oh yea) and focusing on dungeon runs and/or grinding mobs out in obscure locations where people seldom visit. Boring as it sounds, it is actually rather effective. The larger number of mobs that you kill on your way to 60 also means you have more chances at getting a BoE epic or valuable blue in the process. 
---
You are not too late. Far from it. But you might get smacked around more by the opposing faction if on a PvP realm.
---
Wow til thanks!
---
Yeah, this is currently insane. When I played in vanilla the populations were much smaller, and I only ever was in one single full 40 man pvp raid, and it was on the crossroads, and most of us were in the 45-57 range of levels. we made it pretty far and did a lot of damage but the whole thing lasted maybe 10 minutes before we were overrun by guards and other players. 
---
Zones are completely ransacked right now. Boats are literally impossible to use, going to the other continent is nearly impossible as alliance. Menethil harbor is consistently littered with bodies, rogues are at every exit point to the town, the gryphon master is always dead, and both boats have 15+ horde on it at any point. This literally never happened in vanilla, it couldn't. You can't fight back against it either because of the massive population imbalances. It gets worse as time goes on and people just stop playing. There is nowhere to hide, the horde have access to every zone on the eastern kingdoms, the north is theirs, the south has a direct line right to both major cities, and theirs happen to also have guards, hell they have a teleport directly to the zone of our major city and the starting zone of gnomes and dwarves. I get this sounds like boo hoo woe is me, but I want to point this out because the little defenses we do have get overrun by the absolutely massive populations these servers carry, and the game was never designed to handle this.
---
Just yesterday i had 4 ally rogues camping the og-uc zeppelin.

I’m not complaining. This was more of a statement to all the people regretting their server choice and giving my personal anecdote. That it is ok to accept your own mistakes and own it. How you interpreted this post as anything remotely negative is beyond me.

Jump button is illegal, we Guild Wars 1 here
---
Am I in the wrong to be pissed off that 2 BREs have been rolled off and given to two duel-wield fury warriors before me, a 2H fury warrior?
---
Never once have I been duel wield, and my guild knows this. Only reason it wasn’t defaulted to me was because I had an epic 2H already from MC, the earth shaker, that I had won many weeks ago. Thoughts?
---
Yeah like the other guy said try chilling a week or two, don't quit yet. :)

TY,  I already have blockada and tried various  alternative yt apps, but none were to my liking.   but I don;t remember trying Vanced, so i'll check that out.

Donde se van a sentar?!
---
Once you hit level 30 as an arms warrior you get a huge power up.
---
I can kill 2 mobs my level easily and 3 things my level usually. I soloed the level 38 and 39 elementals for the whirlwind weapon chain at level 35.
---
But, as you say, it’s not super uncommon to string together 7 misses, parries, and dodges and be in danger.
---
Anyone who really thinks warrior is that bad has issues. The first 20 levels or so is pretty rough though.
---
I am lvl 39 with my hunter, and being a dad of a now 7 months old baby I cant say that I play more than maybe 7 per week in total. There are plenty of players leveling. Yesterday I needed some help with a quest in STV, and after writing in general chat I had a full group only 10 seconds later. 
---
The only gripe is that you will get killed more often, but you are a rogue that can go invisible. Enjoy the game and dont stress anything.
---
Ppl still don't know shit about what they're doing but following known sites guides. ("Yeah but it's bis")

So min/maxing honor requires a gamebreaking addon that renders escape impossible.

Just join a guild of likeminded people! If there is no people like you on your server, then wow classic is unlikely for you, just accept it and move on.

*gm* so yeah uh that's not possible you are going to gm Island prison

God people get so bitchy when pvp comes up at all in chat. Someone pointed out they were being ganked and what area, and letting people know to head there if they want to pvp. Someone chimed in along the lines of "OH IT'S A PVP SERVER WHY DON'T YOU JUST ROLL PVE RETAILDRONE(actual insult used)"
---
Like goddamn dude, they were encouraging pvp, not bitching about being ganked.
---
Hey! That's Zandalar Tribe! I know those guild names!

So far only had great interactions with the scottish boomers!

You’re trolling, right? If not then this is a really sad “lord of the files” / Manchurian / Ayn Rand view of the world which is pretty antithetical to our contemporary understanding of anthropology.
---
Part of what made classic wow so fun was figuring out dungeons together, making new friends, gearing each other, and getting better together. Classic requires teamwork and teamwork requires compassion. That’s why people made so many long lasting relationships.
---
If everyone is CONSTANTLY exclusively out for themselves, 40 man raids would never happen. People would just ninja gear and disappear. The reason people don’t do this is because reputation matters. And you get a good reputation by helping people and being friendly.

The ability to tank or heal, thus easily getting groups. By the time a regular dps gets an instance group, I've cleared two other instances.
---
Stealth - both the ability to skip mobs and the ability to jump someone (as feral) from stealth, bleed him down asap and then travel form and escape his other mates.
---
Gear - not really caring about the weapon and not having to constantly hunt for a new one (still using the gnomeregan one)
---
It's a subpar class, mostly, in terms of performance (poor healing, not-that-good tanking, mediocre dps), it's got a lot of artificial limitations due to its really poor design (can't use a pot in bear form wtf, can't open a chest or a door or talk to npcs in any form), but "it gets the job done".

Based on your description, that addon is very useful. This one, right?  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic)

Thanks, I will be installing it.
---
But it works to show debuffs, because that I have myself. Works with WA Classic or other addons. So should be possible with buffs aswell you would think.

Does it work in combat?

Yes, I think Blizzard will address this and the other countless complaints this forum has spawned in the upcoming expansion, I think it's called burning legion or crusade or something.

Does it matter if you're a "2H warrior" or "DW warrior"? You're all DPS warriors and you use the weapon combination that gives you the best damage.
---
Why are all these people still doing it then?
---
&gt;If everyone is CONSTANTLY exclusively out for themselves, 40 man raids would never happen
---
The individuals in the 40 man raids are there for their loot. The fact that they need others is just a constraint.
---
&gt;People would just ninja gear and disappear. 
---
They don't ninja because there are repecursions and they'd want more gear. People aren't stupid.
---
&gt;And you get a good reputation by helping people and being friendly.
---
By pleasing everyone else's egoes* -- and people got enough of pretending on the internet already. People play games to detach from the bullshit that normal life is where you're constantly put in a hierarchy. I found that freedom is the #1 desired value in today's age.
---
Sorry, dude, we're just plain 'ol primates, nothing complex here.

All wowhead pages will say released in patch 1.13 because that's the classic patch. Vanilla never went past 1.12.
---
Also staff is marginally better depending.  20 SP(from OH) or 200 mana 100 hp and spirit....  I will be rolling on whatever drops first blade/staff, but we have like 8 mages, and 8-ish paladins all bonering for the sword.  I'll happily take the stick and watch them squabble...  XD
---
They usually do this called *character roll back* where chromi comes and just puts your account back in time reversing everything that ever happend
---
How in the world did you think any time in p2 would be good to level? The whole content of p2 is world PvP and that's what you're gonna get. If you're playing an alt you can hope to find same level Alliance and fight with those, but during p2 fight you will and die you will. It will die down ansd p3 will change a lot but this is life on a pvp server in p2 and we all knew it or at least should have known.
---
The difference is that other players actually enjoy doing those activities that you dislike so much.
---
Anyway, cya never.
---
kinda sad, not only do they outnumber 3:1 they gotta exploit
---
You'd have to make some kind of No Cast zone pillar located on the inn, which could lead to problems with fights in and around the inn. Or give the roof invisible walls on top, which would ruin getting up there for people that just wanna hang out on a roof.
---
LBRS is a 55 level dungeon, almost all mobs in there are below lvl 57.
---
It's against the rules to avoid guards by roofcamping
---
cheat? How about no
---
Don't fall for that baloney, I play with someone who has done that run 200+ and has never even seen it drop.
---
I'm sorry to hear you'd be fine but now that I know that you play on the best eu server you will be ganked by me until you quit the game again
---
4 min and 11% upvoted... i can't help but feel people are offended by me telling them stuff they know are true but don't like to hear. Just keep putting fingers in ur ears and pressing downvote and commenting "bye" instead of having a discussion lmao.
---
Yeah when I say across all PvP servers you have to select all the PvP servers individually to look at it which if you select all the NA PvP servers you will see horde dominance (although it is less pronounced than I thought). But online characters each day is likely less important than total number of unique accounts with a lv 60 that have logged in within a week. As that would more accurately represent the number of horde and alliance who are active than "currently online".
---
The code wouldn't be the problem tbh, more likely limitations of the game engine. For example, in a modern game built with, let's say Unity, it would be easy enough (although time consuming) to simply update all your house prefabs to include a collider box in the volume directly above the roof, then specify in the scripts for those prefabs that this collider volume prevents all forms of offensive spell casting, or something along those lines
---
Not so easy with the ancient technology that WoW runs on.
---
I'm not sure if you know this, but even without spy I can just track humanoid to see where you are. :)
---
Except excluding players from your game is never good business practice.
---
They,already have faction transfers.
---
Straight up telling people: "go fuck yourself, you cant play this game " is just insanity
---
Oof, imagine being this insecure.
---
Not if you Shadowmeld before they come close enough.
---
Do you want to play an alt? Or do you want to make gold only? It takes you at least 4-5 days /played to level an alt, imagine how much gold you can farm in that amount of time at lvl 60... even with suboptimal farming methods. I don't think an alt will farm soooo much faster that he will compensate in goldfarming for the time he takes to level.
---
L2P nub
---
Hmm, problem is as Assassination, you want to maximise the amount of backstabs you can get off. Alternating between the two isn't ideal.
---
I didn't realise you could banish it if someone else had tagged it.
---
When I try MC'ing a mob that someone else has tagged it says that's it's already been tapped.
---
Unfortunately taking a flight path in combat is impossible. However while dead, you walk up to the FP, resurrect, click on the flight master (or use the keybind), press the macro and you're off. If you're worried about retrieving your corpse, you can even add to the macro:
---
    /script RetrieveCorpse(); RepopMe(); /script SelectGossipOption(1); TakeTaxiNode(1)
---
That would instantly revive you and try to take a flight path. You'll still need to right click the NPC however (no way for macros to do that for you).
---
It's better if yoy don't. 
---
The more they suffer, the more they whine.
---
The more they whine about world pvp making it impossible to level up, the faster we'll get wsg and av.
---
It's a sacrifice im willing for them to make.
---
Havent bough gold, laptop was scanned for spyware and he never logged in through anything exept the blizzard launcher. No idea gow they got to him.
---
Wait. I have a bit of trouble understanding something. Is Zandalari a good server or ... ? Btw this is not my IGN
---
It was someone on his own faction, so PVP rules don't apply.
---
Officers get gear first.
---
Man I'm still salty about sharing tier tokens with a certain paladin officer back in 3.3.
---
WASD (strafing) with QERFTV and 123456 for abilities with shift/ctrl modifiers easily usable too. \` key (left of 1) for self target.

I have gone back to a Naga, but man the original Naga was so much better than this new one.
---
Like I said: I believed that 10 am midweek would be a time where hardly anyone is online. I was very wrong about that.
---
I was actually really wondering if this was going to be about the actual bug phase two had where his animation of emerging would always play twice. Seems they managed to not introduce it this time around.
---
But this is PvE griefing.
---
Portugal which has the same timezone as uk
---
Haha yeah bro, I mean they rolled a pvp server so it's totally normal to corpsecamp then for 5 hours, if they really cared they should just be 60 .
---
Can anybody give a source on whether or not DKs give instant -honor? All I see here is people just dismissing the other side without any proof on their end.
---
I did some SS fighting yesterday too and people said there was a bluepost that said it takes away some of the honor you would have gotten by HKs immediately.
---
I was careful but some idiots still aoe spammed civilians while not being able to help the heals deal with the guards (which are safe to kill)!
---
Jebus ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
The support said gold was restoed but most itsm cannot. Of course we contacted them again, waiting for response now just wanted to get info from people whi have experienced this before.
---
As I said. You just need alliance to be bad right now and nothing will change your mind. Sad, actually.
---
so even without killing princess it's worth it gold wise?
---
You fucker
---
Lol at the spergs actually believing this.
---
There is a reason there are special rules in the streamer PvP tourney to help Warriors because they literally get worked by almost every class even played by the very best with the very best gear.
---
The issue is their skill floor is so high and can make quick work of shitters and basic bitches of other classes when they have no idea what they are doing.
---
You deserve to be food if you get beat 1v1 vs warriors, you are trash.

It just sounds like you aren't really cut out for playing WoW. It has always been a hamster wheel, that is what MMOs are.
---
I hope its for selling twink items and not for his own twink that would be ironic.
---
There are also the diminishing returns. They could have killed the same people over and over for hours, which doesn't give any honor past the fourth kill.
---
Yeah 😂 someone told me he could only play 3 - 4 hours a day and had to go on a business trip and was on a holiday with is girlfriend. What a f*cking loser lol 😂😂😂 dem casual plebs
---
Exactly. If he's getting 200g pr. day he'd be able to afford an epic mount in just 5 days. It'll take 67 summons pr. day but I think that might be a little high but maybe I'm wrong.
---
As a 58 druid looking to respec to a HOTW build, should I leave my last 2 pts for HOTW?  Seems like NS is too important to wait.
---
&gt; just move somewhere else
---
So a bunch of 30s trying to level in Hillsbrad "should just go level somewhere else" because a 60 mage cheats and stands on a roof killing everything?
---
What an idiotic thing you've taken the time to type here
---
So on servers with no queue you want to artificially force a queue? Doesn't sound really fair to me
---
Think people will have been abusing the gadgetzan roof so frequently that they'll have not been taking any chances
---
Not sure how it happened, but I tanked anger at a specific point and when the adds spawned, they didn't aggro me.
---
I assume you're referring to diminishing returns. Currently it's 33% reduction in that type of certain cc if you use it within 15 seconds of each other.
---
They can play the game, just not on an overplayed faction/server combo. They still get the same game service as everyone else pays for. 
---
Server transfers aren’t solving the issue and you know it, they’ve had server transfers in retail forever and most retail servers are 95/5. 
---
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
---
Nah reroll
---
Than I do think its possible, but its inposible to see enemy buffs without a mage casting detect magic on them am I right?
---
Another change that wasn't in classic, much like the loading screen immunity
---
Sounds like you don't enjoy the end of endgame PvE. That's a shame, but I guess it can't be for everyone. Having a blast in MC and Ony and fighting over world bosses. Looking forward to BWL and the later raids even more, though, and having found a guild with nice people it's pretty damn fun to work together to down bosses, wherever they may be. If you leveled a shaman in WotLK (I played shammy too then, and do again now!) why did you not give that a shot in classic? But bottom line, don't continue if you don't enjoy it.
---
The more skewed it is, the harder it is for the majority faction to farm honour.
---
47 lvl warrior here, planning to tank at max lvl. What should be my primary focus now? Should I farm Princess for ring or just quest as much as possible and just farm it later? I think I will start feralas today. Should I lean more towards dungs?
---
I feel leveling is more about the journey and chasing loot at 60 is more about a means to an end. I enjoy the leveling journey and obviously can understand other people enjoying it. For chasing loot at 60 i don't enjoy it... and the rest of my impression about that process and why people would do it are in my post.
---
Yeah the numbers are going to be fairly low but I see a ton of people who head on over to southshore and join the zerg for an hour or so and then leave again later on.
---
Not sure what servers you are playing on but in mine eve heavy pvpers are saying now that its boring as fuck.
---
Simply amazing.
---
Except they cant, noone wants to play alone while your friends are on another realm. Get a grip.
---
You're playing the most OP class in Classic. I think you can deal with a bit of inconvenience.
---
It is the best server, I play horde on there
---
Who cant enter the ship so they are useless. Meanwhile gobbos got buffed and shoot through walls on zeps. #nochanges my arse, horde got it easy mode and still needs buffs.
---
&gt; They started on 1.12 to make the game less difficult to attract more players. 
---
They also started because it meant a greater number of existing bugs and issues were fixed. Imagine buying classic and finding it shits out on your video card because of a 13 year old bug.
---
Yes please
---
Obviously to get their honor point.
---
 I mean it’s he only difference with one week ago: PvP didn’t magically become super fun nor did they add something beside putting in place a system that give rewards.
---
I expect many people will see that the honor grind is way longer that they believed and question if they have fun this week.
---
You have a very narrow, potentially destructive, vision of the world. It sounds like it’s working out well for you in both video games and real life.
---
Primates are also a terrible example for your argument. They’re caring, organized, and work together.
---
It sounds like we’re at an impasse so I’m gonna go on being friendly and helpful to people while you go around being selfish and assuming the absolute worst of folks. Want to compare notes in 10 years and see whose slept better and derived more meaning and joy from their surroundings?
---
You, son of a ... he was healing you!
---
Probably a decent mix of both. Spamming Mara is going to drive you nuts. You've got a decent way to go yet so no need to burn yourself out grinding bis yet.
---
They were doing it before P2, just on a smaller scale
---
Did you just kill the priest who decided to Mindcontrol and heal you?
---
2.1 jfc what server was that. I hit 14 and only had to clear 1 million once
---
So two things. 
---
First and foremost - Shadow priest mana sucks, get used to it. It's the biggest (arguably, only) weakness of the class/spec. 
---
Secondly, you will - assuming relatively equal skill/gear - never really be top tier damage either compared to pure damage classes like mages, locks, rogues. 
---
So with that being said, while levelling up to 60, you're gonna burn through a SHITLOAD of water, especially if you're healing, since the shadow talents barely give any benefit toward that. 
---
What you really wanna focus on if you're dpsing, is a decently healthy mana pool moreso than spirit regen. While casting, you get AT BEST 15% of your spirit as regen, and don't really have the option as healers do to just not cast and wait for spirit regen to kick in. 
---
So you're gonna want to focus more on getting a decent chunk of INT in order to boost that mana pool. Since spell costs don't change, having more INT and therefore more mana directly increases the amount of spells you can toss out before oom, and its a far more effective solution than trying to stack a ton of spirit in an attempt to regen mana faster than you burn it. 
---
Consumables like Dark Rune, Demonic Rune, and Mana Potions are also your best friend, you'll use a lot of them.
---
You're definitely going to want a solid amount of +DMG as well, whether that be general spell damage or shadow damage specifically. Around ~200 is good, more is always better. 
---
BUT! Damage isn't everything, especially when it comes to certain pieces, most notably trinkets. Over a long fight, you're actually better off with regen/sustain trinkets like 2x Mindtap Talisman, or Mindtap + Burst of Knowledge, than with pure damage trinkets like Briarwood Reed or Talisman of Ephemeral Power.
---
 Aside from Shadow Word: Pain, the spell damage coefficients on our spells are pretty bad. So if you've got the mana pool and regen stats to get off an extra 2-3 flay casts, you'll do more damage overall opposed to having an extra 100 shadow damage.
---
Lastly, for pure raid/dungeon dps (also works for solo farming) you'll want something sorta like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/0542001305--5032500103501051) for your talents. 
---
The points in the second row of Disc are fairly interchangeable, but the threat reduction helps massively in groups, not only in preventing you from pulling aggro and dying, but also it lets you start your damage sooner, and sustain it for longer, before you have to back off/slow down due to threat.
---
In regards to rotation, in groups you'll wanna start generally with SW:P, and start flaying your target. You can use rank1 to quickly stack shadow weaving at little mana cost, then go to max rank at 4-5 stacks. Use blast sparingly, it generates a ridiculous amount of threat, but is great for a finisher both to burst runners down and to proc your spirit tap regen. Also use it when threat isn't an issue and you're not in danger of pulling aggro. Almost never open with it, as you'll then become the tank.
---
 And that's basically it, it's not a complex rotation. Keep Pain up, refresh it when it drops off, don't do it early. Flay in the meantime, get the full 3 ticks each time, don't re-cast it early, blast when you can, wand when you're oom/chilling for threat.
---
So anyways I hope you enjoyed my TED Talk and I wish you the best of luck in all your priestly endeavors.

Inb4 'streamers r bad'. 
---
I saw some video from Asmongold about warrior keybinds, basically copied it with a few personal changes, and I use that for everything now. A and D for strafe instead of turn, every other button in reach of my hand on WASD is a spell button, with mouse buttons and ctrl/shift modifiers too. From there I just set certain buttons to be certain spells regardless of class, i.e 4 is a slow, 5 is an execute or high damage ability, Q is a slow cast ability, E is an interrupt, G is the most commonly used AoE. Makes playing different classes easier (more so for retail where I have more alts)

*just press the 'stop early' button and you'll land at the next closest flight path.*

This has literally never once worked for me in classic.

They CAN, but they don’t want to for their own reasons. This and faction queues are practical solutions that have been proven to work in the past on servers with bad faction ratios. You’re not presenting any alternative, just saying “it’s bad”. Tell me how you’re going to prevent 95/5 splits if not with faction queues.

Okay Mom.

Erhm? There are still apes irl.

So far I'm not enjoying Warlock as much as I think I'd have enjoyed a Rogue. Although I'm hoping an SL build will make me a PVP god.

Assuming blizzard don't  'fix' the mana cost of lower rank heal spells it wouldn't be out of place for priests (at least with the heal crit proc in the holy tree) to be spamming low rank flash heals or normal heals to get the armour boost on a tank.

I've not reached 60 so don't know if they have locked the mana cost in yet.

why would it take a month? you can get to rank 4 this week

Probably just do quests in EPL/WPL/Winterspring until you have 20/20 complete, and then heal to 60. Even that might not be doable, there's not many quests in classic.
---
Is it really even worth it to get a tiny headstart in a game that (even though it probably will happen) is likely 2 years away? You could be doing so much to catch up in the current game. You're really not behind a curve yet.
---
Hold your fuckin horses mate, am I bitching about something?
---
That’s me! Hello :)
---
Think so, I'm not a part of it though
---
I’m Luthien so hope you’ve had some nice Crusade interactions!
---
Yeah, by being in top 2%. But in that case your ceiling is way higher than rank 4, so you'll keep grinding. People that will cap out in rank 3 (56% percentile) are only going to get 2k honor per week so it will take them a month to gather 5k.
---
You seem like you have nothing valuable to add to the disucssion outside of personally attacking me for no reason at all.
---
Very annoying change as a warrior, I got used to range pulling a mob and seperating him from a pack. Now I can't do it.
---
Is this intentional? Or was the intent only that specific mob said in the hotfix, with all others being changed unintentionally?

Literally never a 1 on 1 on this server, very interesting
---
I've heard it's one of the best zones for farming Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage.  It also features the Hydraxian Waterlords faction, which is kind of neat.
---
Because way less people enjoy playing games for actual fun nowadays. most people play for min maxing and rewards. Horde have better racials which is why they dominate pvp servers. Most people who play wow nowadays arent loyal to a faction, theyre loyal to the best race and class combination for what they want to do.

You can tell people should have guessed, that they should have rolled PvE, that it's their fault they didn't get how elitist the honor system was and that's true. 
---
Now I'm just pointing that during all the months before release, that's not why many people said: how many times did I read that getting to rank 10 was easy, that World PvP was super fun, that it would be stupid to remove honor gain from killing lvl48 when you're 60 because #nochange.
---
And in the end, the result is the same: population will dwindle massively if PvP is not fun and PvE kept on being that easy with barely any challenge.

I see what you're saying, yet I disagree that any player could mimic the behavior of spy. The amount of attention one would have to pay to the combat log is immense as compared to the giant sign across the screen saying "Stealth player detected!"
---
Sure, it is QoL, but I believe that the main problem is that it comes to the detriment of other players.
---
But the banishing of mobs againt people of the same faction isn't PvP.    
---
Blizzard, at least in the past, has taken action against active griefing outside of PvP action.

Personally, I'm enjoying raiding each week, even when I don't get loot. I'm also enjoying leveling alts in my downtime. 
---
If you don't enjoy those things, it's fine man, just don't play. It's not a big deal. Glad you got to enjoy it for 2 months
---
Get on discord and offer a payment to the other faction to camp him.
---
Yes, you can find it in Silmarillion.
---
have you raided with hemo? or just dungeons thus far?
---
All the time it takes to turn in those quests you could literally do 2 quests in hellsfire and get the same exp.
---
Stupid idea.
---
You can't really blame people of pvping on a pvp server. I left a 60 to reroll on a pve server and I haven't regret it for one second so I would recommend you to do the same if it's that bad on your sever.
---
I voiced the same opinon, and i think you are right.
---
I don't have much interaction that stayed in my mind with you all :I
---
I just recognize guild names by now, with some i have really good associations, others... not so much.
---
If you ever see me around in game come say hi. I'm Urmagh in the guild Stroll :)

That's not how the system works though.
---
I mean I have 230ish SP and I'm almost full preraid bis, my COC hits for around a thousand in a crit, with buffs and full pve spell power build its probably possible, but it seems like that would be on the upper level of power without using the trinket that gives you like 150 sp on a CD

"WELP, this isn't going to end well."
---
Worked yesterday for me.  Flying from Moonglade to Teldrassil, clicked the 'stop early' after 10 seconds on the flight to stop in Darkshore.
---
If you need to stop, click it early and only once.
---
&gt; Everlook has like 5 people INSIDE that will one shot people and suicide to the guards and repeat
---
Those I literally don't get. If you die to a guard you loose durability. Your victim doesn't. Who in their right mind think that's a good way to farm honor?
---
As a ret pally I'm finding it hard to get into groups. I have improved might and Kings which get me into most groups but there is still a lot of prejudice around ret.
---
I know I'm not a dps class, I don't pretend to be able to out damage a mage or a rogue. What I *will* do is provide decent dps while at the same time keeping an eye on the party for patch heals, bops, stuns for wandering mobs etc. Utility, essentially. I feel like I've saved groups I've been in a few times just by being aware of a healer in danger or those stay mobs.
---
So I'm summary. I love you all and let me love you!
---
I’ve heard this before but nobody has given any proof
---
That happened because people don't like these attention-seeking "I'm quitting!" threads, not because they're offended. I didn't downvote you by the way, I left a more positive post above.
---
You aren’t getting the response you want because you’re condescending.  These raiders you feel bad for knee what they were signing up for and wanted it.  Also, classic is nowhere near the hamster wheel of retail but yes the content is more gated.
---
If you don’t like the grind and enjoy leveling and then pvp, twinking might be for you.
---
It was bullshit that it was bannable back then just like it's bullshit now.  Both factions have equal access to the roofs, let it be a king-of-the-hill style wpvp objective.
---
Blizzard gambled on everyone leaving and were wrong.
---
It gives -Contritubtion points and is instant. Right now it doesn't matter as we all have 0 CP. Next week (or later today once the reset happens) it WILL matter.
---
Even if it does end up being no problem this week, I can't believe anyone would be ok with any number of red entries on their Honor tab...
---
As a shadow priest I am also dead across the room my DoT brother
---
Then explain how world pvp was so dead at some point in Vanilla blizzard had to add qu'est to encourage people into world pvp? BG killed world pvp, not flying
---
Fuck off, prick.
---
Yes, and it stacks with SnD and BF. Which means it will (with =&lt;40%) give you:
---
1.30*1.20*1.30 = 2.028 faster attack speed. 
---
Basically doubling attack speed for 10 sec, which is a huge dps increase.
---
Quit then
---
yeah same, Im only playing classic for pvp but theres no way Im doing a warlord grind and all the gear you need is from raids. as far as I can tell, theres one person in this rogue thread that raids with hemo and thats cus his guild lets him. just wondering if others have done the same.
---
not worried so much about dungeon output, but how it performs in raids
---
where can i see the alliance/horde rates on my server? (Blaumeaux)
---
They have pretty high armor so a solo warrior as your dps can just drag on too long, they are on of the easiest if you have 3+ instead of 2man
---
I might be having some type of conflict with an addon then. There are a few others in my guild having the same issue, but not all of them.
---
You're equating my response to you with brutal murders committed by mobs?
---
Wow.
---
Engineering &gt; bombs are extremely helpful.
---
Also, as others have said, battle shout. Try to get sunders up as quick as possible. Make sure you mark targets!! It’s so important, I felt like it wasn’t that vital at first but it helps a TON with aggro.
---
I really hope so.
---
Mana conservation, heal canceling, trying to stay out of the FSR is what I dig in being a healer.
---
You seem offended
---
Upvote for SchlongGonger
---
As a fellow hordy I have to admid: allis are way more friendly
---
3-4 hours a day is not that casual imo. I've been getting online maybe 10-14hours a week and just hit 60 a week ago. I've had no trouble finding groups for anything. Many of the less casual players on my guild have their alts in the 30-50range so you should be good.
---
Depends how it's setup. Some LCs aim to distribute evenly so everybody gets a slow drip-feed or loot, others aim to stack up individual players one at a time as that's the best for performance (who is making more out of ToEP/Mageblade? The Mage with T1 hat/bracers/boots, the ragnaros necklace and t2 pants or the Mage still relying on several AH greens?)
---
LC exists to distribute loot as the guild sees fit, there's not really a "solid" goal of LC as a rule.
---
That's as boring and unfun as the constant corpserunning.
---
Wrong game.
---
A lot of people have HS near BRM, noone has in Feralas
---
Unless you're zerging TM/SS, chances are there'll be opposing faction raids just steamrolling you if you're not in a raid yourself. Experiences may vary from server to server but on Lucifron it's not much fun to me. Just huge zergfests and almost no smaller scale fights.
---
I neither enjoy steamrolling 3 people as a 40 man raid, nor do I enjoy being on the opposite site. It certainly wasn't like this back in the day. The efficiency mentality and the easily available knowledge on how things work (like R14 honor grind) nowadays certainly alter the experience a lot (not even talking about 1.12 talents and gear in early content patches).
---
I mean what can you really do about it?
---
People generally ask for a fee.
---
&gt; Yes I expected to get ganked, yes I expected to get camped, but no, I did not expect level 60's (6 of them) to stomp my level 46 in circles for 45 minutes (the time it took me to kill 10 mobs because of the fact) at 10 a.m. server time on a week day. Wasnt for honor, it wasnt for revenge, it was just a waste of everyone's time, for 45 minutes.
---
So what you're saying is, you never played on a PvP server in vanilla?
---
Uhhh ? Who cares ?
---
Fun fact:  Blizzard wanted to make a MMORPG based on the Warhammer Fantasy Universe. They didnt got to an agreement with Games Workshop so they decided to make their own.
---
“Anyone who disagrees with me is a liar!11!!1”
---
They can transfer, they aren’t held hostage.  Your whole guild can transfer if they’re all upset by queues.
---
There are addons to show you incoming heals.
---
It's just a matter of time and luck. 5 weeks isn't all that many and you have gotten some bad luck for mages, or rather you haven't gotten good luck. My guild has a couple mages that have similar gear and we use dkp (free roll boes and onyxia), we just have had mc on farm for a lot longer than you and have gotten some decent luck.
---
&gt; snitch 
---
What is this, high school or prison? No mature grown-ups will actually complain about someone reporting another person committing an offense.
---
Yeah, I’ve come realize the need button is more of an anti ninja button. The “I’m not going to be the only one not clicking this” button
---
Can someone explain to me what’s actually happening?
---
Why can’t those people be on to of the roof? I mean I did that in other MMOs, too?
---
And I’m telling you, on Stalagg, a strong horde leaning server, it’s still a 50/50 shot that you will die there even as a horde player.  It’s one of the most contested spots in the world.
---
seems fair since you would have to carry around all the materials needed for example the enchant (unlikely for crusader or 55 healing or whatever). And that's what I mean with if they're willing to through the hassle they're most likely trustworthy anyhow.
---
No, I'm talking out of experience. You are however, super clueless.
---
A MoM warrior will die after pressing charge. Warriors are useless in caster meta.
---
Paladins don't have any ranged burst (ele shamans do) and paladins don't have grunding totem (ele shamans do) that fits perfectly into a caster meta.
---
I agree, I think BG's will mostly solve this issue.  More honor to be had in BG's than in WPVP....  It may even go back to a playable game on the bigger PvP servers....  Maybe....
---
Theres roof rules?
---
I'm not racing, though. Just want to be as effective as I can be as a paladin. BC Prot pala is my favorite class/specc of all time and I was too young when BC was out to really play it, if you know what I mean.
---
What do you want to discuss, the game isn't for you ...that's fine . Just leave play something other . No hard feeling's .
---
Different people enjoy different stuff .
---
You can set /castsequence to reset after a certain amount of seconds, so if you set that to your Backstab cooldown you basically cast it everytime you use that macro. So it would be something like:
---
    /castsequence reset=6 Backstab, Sinister Strike
---
This resets the castsequence after 6 seconds (not sure what the backstab cooldown is.
---
The exp is calculated by players average, so it maybe better to pick up more people at lower level dungeon to lower the average level.
---
this has been working for me [you can see his talent build at 3:00](https://youtu.be/qoDq2FcYXmE) you can buy some potions on AH for healing incase resist etc.
---
Glad I'm on a PvE server.
---
How many points in "improved enslave demon" is needed to enslave a doomguard by the entire "enslave demon" duration?
---
Seems like fishing in azshara. Must be very lucky. :p
---
lol you're literally wrong and either playing on a tiny server, on horde, or just don't care to go check.  It seems like you're just making it up based on "nobody roams stv as 60" when it happens daily.
---
\*\*CEASE YOUR FUCKERY, MORTAL PLEBS\*\*
---
boomer
---
If only there was a different server option for people who don't want to engage in PvP. 
---
&gt; And too all the griefing horde out there that say this is part of the game, you are wrong. 
---
Why? Is it because *you* chose to roll Alliance on a PvP server and didn't expect that horde players will go out of their way to kill you, just like any dominant faction does on any server?
---
The manual also had dwarf mages, so yeah not everything made it into the game.
---
lmao the ship already sailed for devilsaurs
---
thanks very much! :)
---
I rolled PvP cuz I was looking to get me some kills but I’m getting killed instead and I don’t like it
---
No ofc not only the master pvp race is to chicken shit to walk infront of a capital city. Meanwhile alliance have to walk infront of 1 for 4 dungeons.
---
The problem isn't going to be BG queues. If alliance players leaves in significant numbers, there will be an even bigger problem down the line - the AQ opening.
---
These people that try to shut down any attempts to group up and fight back are the worst.
---
Wanting to hear if other people feel the same as me or wanting to better understand people's motivations for loot chasing/raiding. And if by chance some people agreed with me, could talk about how things could theoretically be more to our liking.
---
I run into the same problem. I work 3-1130, so I get on after midnight and I have a hard time finding a group as well. I would suggest adding any tanks you like to your friends list. That way, you have the two hardest roles filled and dps should be easy to find. I'm a tank and I have found 5-6 healers I like to run with and added them.
---
Im at 4k hk's since honor was released... I participate, but much prefer to do it when I'm not already doing something time consuming, and only worth the work for the ends....  
---
You're really going to sit there and tell me the inflated numbers on these servers don't float the worst to the top?

Still same 1.13
---
Patch would have put is 1.14.xxxx
---
It makes it much harder to hit and interact with your character, meaning you can gank people unfairly.
---
Spy doesn’t work the way you think it does.  You can sneak up on an opponent as long as you don’t do any actions that report into the combat log.  Don’t buff, don’t change stances or forms, don’t go into stealth.
---
There were people in my guild who legit thought that if they pvped all week they'd get rank 12 or 13 in 1 week.
---
I dunno how people can be so clueless.
---
Oooo ok that's pretty cool then
---
That should be an add-on.
---
You can't. All sites providing estimations and they are sometime very far away from reality.  
---
Blizzard don't want for people to know it, because it will screw balance even further.
---
tip: berserker stance breaks sap and grenade effects
---
You're correct!
---
What happens to rare spawns re-spawn timer during a server reset? A rare mob I'm trying to kill should spawn between now and 8pm today (EST) however there's a server reset at 10am EST. What will happen? Will it reset the timer or will it spawn after the reset?
---
Just a very incredible fishing pull.
---
I disagree that it's easy: getting to rank 10 in phase 2-3 with how many people are playing hardcore in classic will be quiet hard for people who can't play in team for more than 20 hours each week for two months. 
---
Like I disagree that world PvP is always fun when you're on the winning side: like I told, roaming areas for 10 minutes to found a poor ally already being camped by 5 other people is super boring.
---
And yes it's challenging to make speed run but almost nobody cares. Only a very small fraction of the game wants to grind material and optimize everything to be able to clear MC in 30min instead of 1h30 because there's no point.
---
But like I said: game can continue like this and game will become a niche of hardcore players. There will probably be enough people interested so they don't close servers but at the cost of seeing people leaving each months and seeing the hype totally die.
---
Correct. But 58+ party can skip some packs just by walking around.
---
why?  If players can't play it seems natural to go the forums to see if anyone else is having similar issues?
---
It's 60k for rank 14. 40k is only rank 10. Do yeah, 14k points puts you squarely in rank 4.
---
You think that flight point campers have realised that honourless target is a thing yet?
---
Same on Shazzrah. The main issue is the absolutely impossible uphill battle against faction population disparity.
---
OmniBar
---
There is. But who care? We killed Onyxia with 16 people.  
---
In full 40 raid there's plenty mana to throw heals here and there.
---
5-15g usually, but if there's only one person on your server with the pattern, it could be much more.  The guy on my server with lionheart helm charges 300g for the combine.  He can do this as long as nobody else has it.  That's a legendary combine fee, but people pay it.
---
O no!
---
Lol xD
---
Well, there is the issue of how people get to Bulwark - if they approach from the WPL side they will have been in a contested zone and will be pvp flagged for a further 5 minutes, and unless they come from OG-&gt; Tirisfal via zepp, odds are they just zepped from Grom'gol or zoned in to UC via a portal from a contested zone - still leaving them flagged when reaching the Bulwark if riding on an epic mount.
---
So what you're saying is the grievers made you stop playing the game.... which is literally their aim.  So they won.
---
Sure. But now it feels like people never quest and only die
---
no thanks, I don't want some loser ruining the Classic experience just because he wants to stream and play WoW
---
You do realize you are replying to a Warrior, right?
---
Leveling as a healing priest people would tell me I’m often too low level, which was secretly a blessing. Every time I did a run I wa “underleveled” for, it was a sign the group knew what they were doing.
---
So was mine (winks)
---
What level are your alts? Because it's really only a problem from 48-59
---
There are no balanced Alliance Horde servers except for Heartseeker which is tiny and a transfer server.  If you’re dying as Horde you’re just bad.
---
because its a huge waste of time To add bosses when you will do the run  150 times. How hard is it to understand.
---
god. i had that happen 2 days ago! it was the first time seeing a 4 cast pool, let alone that
---
Yeah that's not how it works m8 lol.
---
Again, the code has to exist. If it doesn't exist, then they have to have it "in the budget" to put it in and test it.
---
....even then, look at Warmode. It gave a bonus to XP and Gold, but players still found it faster to level without it on. This would be the reverse, but the player ideology would be the same; "I'm rolling Horde no matter what, but I'm going for the heavily populated one...despite the penalty...because I'll have a better chance of getting groups and leveling faster".
---
You'd have to increase the penalty to such an extent that the 'opposing' side, with the penalty, would just up and quit or reroll on a different server. - Players are like cats, you can try and tell them how you want them to play, and they'll just opt for the "fuck you" route.
---
Yeah that makes sense then.
---
Depending on where most people on your server are from, midnight could be 1am-2am for the majority of your server. It's not surprising that there aren't many people looking to start new groups then.
---
Best option is to find a guild with people in similar timezones/with shift work. Might take a while to find one that fits but probably your best bet for finding regular groups.
---
Other option is to take advantage of the empty server and hit up those grinding spots. Although this doesn't help you get dungeon groups, you'll probably have to search for them some other time.
---
Maybe because it's an actual problem
---
“Thøtslayer” lmao
---
Don't give up hope :D My GF got Mageblade 1 week and 1 day after we dinged 60. She got the offhand + Mageblade in 2 runs. Easy as cake! :D
---
Assmongold. His expressions about vanilla videos "ye I know that yea it's good" ^10 ^seconds ^later "ye I remembered that yea it's bad" is really entertaining.
---
The difference is the lock boxes I believe. Major HP drops from the 225 lock boxes rather then the 175 which I think.drop superior. 
---
I can sell 5 superiors on my server atm for about 2g and then I can sell 1 major for 2g. That's the difference for me PPing the slightly higher level mobs
---
You're going to get burned out and get sick of camping people in Kargath, 100%. You've unintentionally ruined the game for yourself, whether you realize it or not. I'll be amazed if keep logging in for the next few months.
---
So, you want to discuss things you have absolutely no idea about? To each their own I guess.
---
Prick. Remember that warrior and don’t group with him again.
---
You can't swap servers unless you're on an overpopulated one or start over completely
---
Nah, what you're talking about is only true in 1v1 pvp. In object orientated pvp, the form of pvp that will have the highest participation over time once it's released, warriors are simply the best class when supported by healers. Every other class is secondary in this regard. Having a pvp team with only healers and warriors is completely viable and would stomp most other teams.
---
Two questions:
---
I'm 38.. My cooking skill is 150 and I need 25 skill points for my new recipes. Where is it good to farm lion meat? I heard in arathi are lvl 34 tigers to farm.
---
Second question: In order to get my Mount I still need circa 40g,so I thought about grinding on earth elementals. Where are they located and can they resist nature damage? (have a ele shami)
---
Backstab is an instant cast that doesn't have a Cooldown. So this macro wouldn't be viable :(
---
Must be aliens.
---
They make PvE servers where this doesn't happen. Join those.
---
&gt;  but they shouldn't have rolled on PvP servers if they don't like world PvP 
---
80% of the servers are pvp and half of the pve servers are full, it's not like many pve players did had a choice anyway.
---
Damn. You’ve lived a great life then
---
Damn. I have it but I couldn't get past the first 50 pages. It's so dense
---
For the last few days ive spent most of my time killing questing lvl50 allies in searing gorge and burning steppes in a raid group as my almost fully raidgeared 60 horde mage(undead). The excitement i get when i see them respawn and my spy addon does the ding sound is unmatchable. They try to mount up and get away but they are no match for my 100% purple skeletal warhorse that i aoe farmed for. 😁
---
I sometimes try fighting 60s but the warriors and paladins just beat my ass so easily, i dont bother
---
I also really like camping the flight paths in tanaris and feralas. Most of the time when me and my rogue friends wait for more low level allies to land, we get so impatient we accidentally kill them before they even grant honor. Haha its not a big deal though, because when they respawn they are honorable kills and even easier to kill.
---
Anyways thought id share. Im really liking phase 2 and i hope they dont release bgs too soon. World pvp is a blast! 😆
---
Had us in the first part, not gonna lie :D
---
It wasnt really pointed at the op or anyone specifically, but i can see how you thought that it was.
---
That happened in my guild chat the day of launch a dude said something about being fp camped by 3 dudes and asked for help one guy just said “lol you should have rolled over if your gonna cry about wpvp “
---
This isn't a correct analysis, if you are considering alliance players.  If you are considering them food, then yes.  Food is scarce and players are numerous.
---
Why don't you just post it in reddit? Basically the same thing, we are all wow players, maybe some of us can help with your school project.
---
It's world of Warcraft, not care ear happy fun time game
---
Camera, movement controls and auto attack toggle swap over but you still have your own action bars. Doing anything other than controlling your target will break the Mind Control channeling but instant cast spells like PW:Fortitude or Renew still work since the target was friendly when the cast happened.
---
You tell the game to cast your instant cast. The game casts the spell. You casting a spell tells the game to break Mind Control. It breaks. The break happens as a response to actions, no check is done on cast to see if you are mid Mind Control so instant casts happen before the break.
---
Well then, never mind. I retract my nerd rage.
---
I begrudgingly dropped alchemy/herbalism for mining/engineering, and I really miss the passive income from alchemy.  I'll share with you my best tip, which is not a "get rich quick" scheme but a 15-30g easy on the AH each day.  Always pick up mountain silversage and plaguebloom when you see them.   Every time you're in town, check AH for mountain silversage and plaguebloom at a reasonable price.  Buy the recipe for elixir of the mongoose.  Whenever you can combine  a stack of these, put them up on AH.  
---
I usually can make a stack of these with the materials I've farmed up, sometimes supplementing with an herb or two I buy off AH to round off a stack.  a stack of mountain silversage and a stack of plaguebloom will make 2 stacks of elixirs of the mongoose.  The elixirs sell for 10-15g per stack (sometimes more on tuesdays because of raids).  Easy money.
---
There are a few other potions like this, mana potions always sell really well.
---
I mean you can 2 man arena runs. It's not that hard to make a healer friend. Or have somebody in your guild help you. If you're in a good guild somebody will help you, if you're in a bad guild they'll probably just ignore you.
---
MMO's are about putting in work to achieve a goal in the future. There are alot of things that everyone does in this game that isn't 'fun' because they want the benefits of having a high rank, or having alot of gold, or getting that really rare piece from a dungeon they have already run 90 times, ect, ect. 
---
Is camping farming people in outnumbered senarios 'fun'? Probably not, but the fun part is when the other side gets tired of it and forms their own group to put up a fight. 
---
Most fights are very imbalanced one way or another but if you are farming honor all day you're bound to have a handful of balanced very fun fights. Those are what you look forward to while your grinding honor.
---
Killing civilians in Horde starting areas and cities.
---
We play for the people, seems like you play for the pixels
---
All the effort into this message, none into reading what the guy actually wrote.
---
Impossible scenario.
---
&gt;don't even know how horde feel as though imbalance is fun.
---
We're not having fun either, man. We want more alliance on Skeram just as much as the Alliance!
---
And you cant kill them cause you dont want neg rep with them gobbos
---
4-6 weeks? Try more like 2 weeks.
---
More dots, need more dots. Handle it.
---
Today I was in eastern plaguelands and a level 56 hunter was farming the same mobs as me. I chose not to kill him, because of all these posts making me feel bad about it. Sure enough, 10 minutes later that fucker attacks me, I'm on my way to kill him as 3 rogues prevent that from happening.
---
No mercy from me anymore...I will kill anything that moves that gives honor.
---
Last night we ran into Azuregos, tagged it and downed it. There were two other guilds watching us on the sides waiting for us to wipe but we never did. When we finished the fight the Master Looter was not able to grab the loot, Master Looting control was given to a someone outside the Raid, another Guild, and they took the loot.
---
Or give it only for players who are in the "area level".
---
You are level 60 ? Go pvp in end game areas. Let levels 40/50 slaughter each other in tanaris and levels 20/30 kill each other in hillsbrad
---
^This guy gets it
---
I regret not rolling horde.  And secondarily pve.  But my friends all wanted alliance pvp so I didn't exactly "have a choice," yes I could have played alone.
---
That's true. Thanks for the correction. So in that case it's around 6 levels that you got for free since launch. I wonder how much time that would save on the whole 1-60 process. Rested xp at low levels gives you very little advantage since you lvl so fast, but at 50+ it can save a large amount of time. I guess we'd need some more complicated calculations to estimate this.
---
Groups that are farming honor at flight points are very aware of hour honorless targets work. They will put up detect magic and corral them until the buff falls off before killing them.
---
Well, playing in the team IS easy, that's what MMOs are about, and playing for more than 20 hours every week is super easy: I am a casual player with work, family and social life and my /played is 33 days. Something like 3x of the limit you mention.
---
I would like to appeal to the majority and ask you to show the same amount of threads/people complaining about "we have to hunt for our prey for too long" as there are people complaining about being ganked. 
---
I am sure we will have these kind of complaints eventually but the solution is obvious: if so many people transferred from your server their faction is borderline existent here, somewhere exists a server they have ended up playing: there, likely, their faction is overwhelming. Transfer there! 
---
"Nobody cares" doesn't mean it's not challenging. It's like the same complaint I have heard about retail raids being easy, but the truth was it were normal difficulty players complaining about LFR, who haven't even tried heroic or mythic later on. 
---
A lot of people said classic won't be popular at all to the point Blizzard hesitated to make it but the launch was extremely successful. 
---
I am a casual player (in fact, I quit retail because it was too hard for me) then started classic because I know it's the right difficulty for me) and I enjoy classic as it is. The hype will definitely be lower with more and more people understanding they like retail better and quitting or switching back to retail, there is no shame of admitting it. Maybe you shall do it as well, after all, classic was never meant for everyone.
---
Been doing marau from 46 to 52. Just nets too little exp now.
---
I'm not 'crying' about class imbalance at all. Also not 'crying' about Spy. 
---
You?
---
They were caught with their pants down in regards to Classic.  They business model was for a game that they expected to last a couple months with a forth the quantity of players or less than it actually has.
---
Really shows how out of touch the company has become with it's incredibly loyal fanbase.  Exactly why you won't see me purchasing Shadowlands.  BFA was a joke and they just move on to the next thing.
---
Some people just aren’t made for that war life.
---
It will kill a bunch of noobs, that's for sure
---
Evasion is a no-go against warriors due to Overpower but other than that warrior should be easier for a rogue as you can always kite and let the deadly poison do the work for you.
---
Warlocks are hard in that each pvp pet sets a specific extra hurdle against a rogue:  
---
\-succubus counters your stunlocking with seduce but you can sap the lock and then focus the succubus down followed by restealth  
---
\-voidwalker shield is massive and allows the lock to dot and dps you with impunity  
---
\-felhunter increases their stealth detection
---
Still doable
---
yea man, we get it. The problem youre facing is the important one, other aspects are completly irrelevant. Pls Blizzard, start adressing this problem and fix it without paying attention to other aspects.
---
Flight time.add on? Do tell.....
---
You're either that weird kid from school, or you're trolling. Either way, get help.
---
exactly this, they want to keep the gravy flowing.
---
&gt;This is my 2nd warrior i've leveled to 60 since classic came out
---
There's your problem right there.
---
Yeah, we read online that this might be the case. Yestersay he was changing passwords all afternoon
---
I wouldn't think it would break cast bars entirely, just break the ability to see exactly cast times. I would imagine the default fill bar would remain intact.
---
Maybe the most convenient, but certainly not the most OP.
---
Screech is good for questing and tanking pre 56+ dungeons, it’s the highest threat generating ability and that’s what I’d always use for that content (turn off if you don’t want aoe Threat) 
---
Claw is for all group pve content where you are only there to do damage as it is the highest dps focus dump you can get ST
---
Don’t ever use both same time, they’re focus dumping abilities and will cast every global your pet has focus so it’s one or the other. 
---
For context I tanked a full clear of BRD with my owl at 59 as BM, that’s how op Screech is.
---
One suggestion: try to get your preraid BiS on the journey to 60. That way you can collect gear while you level, which might make some of the repetitive runs less painful.
---
&gt; zerker rage means your in zerker stance prior to the sap, which is something that can also lead to you getting deleted in a stun since youre the squishiest class in the game in that stance
---
Only against casters, your armour still puts you at a higher damage mitigation against physical attacks than most classes (leather and cloth wielders). 10% increase on a 45% reduction from armour still puts you at around 28,5% reduction against physical attacks if my math checks out...
---
Great story man; Mini rivalries like this make the game epic
---
And they chose PvP servers anyway because of the dumb.
---
Kimblee...hey everyone..IM A GIRL PLAYING A VIDEO GAME.
---
It is indeed. Took me several tries, but once you get to about page 200 it becomes like reading LotR (which I really enjoy). Before that, it's a slog and you just gotta fight through it.
---
If you kill 5 people solo, that's 1000 honor. Killing 1 civilian removes 25% of that 1000 immediately.
---
So in this case the punishment is 250 honor.
---
So for this week, the less honorable kills you get the less Dishonorable kills matter.
---
If you have had a lucrative day granting 10-15k honor, and someone in your group nets you a dhk, then that's gonna smart!
---
Do you really think ppl will stop doing wpvp you moron.
---
Bgs will be dominated by premade grps and all those random ppl out there will see no land and pretty fast stop even joining bgs
---
As one lock to another trust me here and spend some gold or grind the mats for a felcloth bag for your soul shards, it is a huge quality of life increase
---
I agree that Noggenfogger is hazardous for alliance at the moment.
---
If you know the correct places, you can have some fun PvP encounters, but most places, you will be heavily outnumbered by Horde.
---
Server maintenance?
---
The average player isn't the smartest. Despite all the information available on the game.
---
Bro you should get some help, seems like you have trouble with empathy.
---
Chances are he’s getting first picks as an officer. 
---
Personally I refuse to join guilds like that. No issue with it, just not going to waste my time with it.
---
2/10 troll.
---
Sure thing. 
---
https://imgur.com/VHl9Jdm
---
Where can you read about how the honor system works?
---
If farming is not a complete turn-off for you, then fiery enchant + just grinding any caster humanoids is really fast as they never get the casts off and you have near zero downtime.
---
could you explain them to me? never heard of this term before
---
But the leveling part is what i enjoy and from what i've tried from other classes i felt warrior clicked with me most, also like feeling useful by being able to tank... or you think i would enjoy endgame content more as a different class?
---
Aye, can't sheep em either. Wonder why Banish would be any different.
---
On a server THAT Horde dominant, I would have just instabanned them for cheating.
---
Might be my Christmas challenge when I'm at home with my parents! Thanks
---
Yikes
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion. You represent about .05% of players playing the game. 2 weeks from now you'll represent about .025% of players. Most players aren't interested in this kind of pvp, and are eagerly awaiting bg's.
---
Feels good after the amount of shit I get for even daring to admit I play on a pve server. 
---
Also it's hilarious how many pvp "refugees" have been rolling new characters on my server the last few days lol.
---
You don't raid with hemo because it takes a debuff slot. Most guilds don't allow that.
---
spotted the Asmongold sub.
---
The thing is that I am right and you claim that I am wrong without bringing any substinance. For the record: Asking to be enlightened is a condescending way of challenging to prove me wrong. Which you failed in a grand fashion as, contrary to seemingly popular believe here, you don't prove someone wrong with just yelling "YOU ARE WRONG".
---
On Stalagg I swear alliance have a rule that you must spend a minimum of one hour roof exploiting.
---
true its a subpar raiding spec, but depends on the guild. I wonder though if you use hemo build but only use SS for raids. that way you save your spec and dont take up a debuff slot :)
---
30 sec. and if you attack them it goes away instandly
---
i rolled pvp server cause I expected it to be kinda like private servers where sometimes you kill them, sometimes they kill you. Not 5000 horde running around looking for a single alliance player to corpsecamp for 2 hours.
---
Not toxic or wrong. I played on private servers; every single PVP server was a gankfest. It's why I specifically chose a PVE server, despite my love of World PVP...I *knew* it would be a 'shitshow'.
---
The larger playerbase on each server just adds to the..."unfun". But it's not the cause. - For what ever reason pServer players are just way more aggressive towards the opposing faction; "red is dead, no matter the level". :\
---
((I reckon a sizable portion of the players on Classic are from private servers.))
---
You are running into the problems every Ele shaman in Vanilla ran into before realizing it's not going to work, or it's not going to work well. Short fights Ele pushes some quite nice numbers, but on longer fights you just will OOM. That said, Meledor's guides (listed by chrispikeuk) are pretty great from what I've seen, maybe you will find some help there. Bring Major Mana pots and Dark/Demonic Runes, that's probably your best bet. And mp5 food.
---
I know we are all \#nochanges, but like would anyone be mad if they fixed the guards?
---
Imagine being this dense
---
Mkay.
---
I did that with BFD/BRD drunk one night and ended up running a few groups through.
---
Punctuation would be great, because of meaning and fluency. People will answer your questions faster and easier, if these are marked.
---
Really hope so. Let the stinky horde sit in queues for hours and hours so we can ask lul why didnt u roll alliance
---
I did like 4 loads of laundry this weekend. That's a victory imo.
---
Only for realms with queues. If you're on a high/medium population server with faction imbalance (which you would be), it doesn't change a thing.
---
Your brother is not very adaptive and that is what it takes to play on a PvP server. You can still quest but you can't afk face roll like in phase 1.
---
If you have some helpful guildies or friends you could perhaps do LBRS or DM:E now too. For the others, 58 is minimum.
---
At least we aren’t bragging about being a little girl who can’t fight.
---
/u/araxom
---
lol similar thing happened to me. A bunch of 60 horde were on top of the cage in gadgetzan sniping everyone trying to level. I wrote about it in general chat and the response from the alliance was essentially "sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server". I told them it was bannable and got called a pussy. sheesh.
---
Ya, I still dropped it because it fucks up /who; as in you can't use it...shift click a name? Nothing. /who z-[current zone]. Nothing.
---
Disable addon.../who instantly works again.
---
Pretty much any ganking can be counted as griefing.
---
It's better to measure in "how much big of a problem it is".
---
I used to love tanking in vanilla but nowadays it's just bad for my blood pressure.
---
If the dps wasnt just looking at the dps meter and actually gave me a few seconds to get threat I would gladly tank but that almost never happens. This is especially bad in dungeons where I need to pull a lot since most people start dpsing before the mob even reaches me.
---
9/10 with rice
---
There should be an achievement of sorts for this, or at least +reputation with your SO.
---
I brought some but you don't want to hear it because you are short-sighted.
---
Yea im so sorry that you now have to cast fear 2 times to beat my is warrior....you're life is so hard :(
---
They're using wall jumping to get there. It's not like this is as simple as walking out of a room to get out of trouble. This is taking advantage in a flaw of the terrain mechanism. It's difficult enough that not everyone can even do it.
---
Stop crying and go play on a PvE server.
---
What an original, interesting viewpoint on the situation.
---
Certainly not anything we've heard a million times on the sub already.
---
I look forward to more quality content of yours in the future.
---
arcanist is mostly garbage for pve
---
I looked around a bit, and it seems the confusion stems from the blue set being horrible, so it originally got changed/buffed in phase 6. 
---
Which is probably why people like myself, and addons like atlasloot etc etc, has it wrong.
---
Imagine sitting in enemy territory trying to find something that was explicitly ruled as cheating because your someone who wants to sit on a rooftop and farm honor in a spot majority of people cant get to you and the guards meant to protect them cant help either
---
&gt;I see ppl saying "this is what you wanted" roll pve  
---
&gt;. Constant death squads with "gps" online going up and down zones killing everything that moves is no pvp. In 2005 u had a chance to escape. Now there is nowhere to hide.
---
I agree with you
---
People who say that fail to realize there is a middle ground between PvE and almost every zone having roaming death balls.
---
If I see a thorium node and a horde, I want to be able to fight him over it. While leveling I had plenty of awesome PvP encounters over resources, and quest mobs. This is the kind of interaction that made me want to roll on a PvP server.
---
It happens at a 7:3 ratio!
---
&gt; People are fucking idiots
---
&gt; Fucking imbecils
---
yeah...everybody else are the angry fellas here...
---
I mean, come on. This is just a post begging for attention. There are plenty of guides that discuss these issues with shaman.
---
Don't use flame shock unless it's been specifically allocated a slot. It uses a debuff slot and you only have 16 to work with, even in a pug without specific debuff assignments, you're likely to be pushing off something more useful if you cast flame shock.
---
Exactly
---
Got two kills in pubg.
---
I generally run content in a 4 man group with some RL buds. feral @ 58 + mage at lvl 60 + resto sham/prot warrior currently at 56.
---
Works as intended. Blizzard build in cooperation into Alliance in subtle way.
---
&gt;And if by chance some people agreed with me, could talk about how things could theoretically be more to our liking.
---
So a game you don't like, where you do not seem to appreciate the players of (as you feel bad for other players although they might enjoy it this way), should cater to your needs/wants?
---
Seriously, just accept that the game maybe isn't for you. Quit it, play something else, but stop judging people who like it, and stop whining about you not liking it.
---
Hi, /u/nameofredditor

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyk5cm/what_are_you_going_to_do_when_almost_all_of_the/). 
---
If you're not min-maxing anything kinda works. My guild has a holy shockadin pala dps who just spams judgement on boss. Terrible dps but bosses go down so who cares.
---
Altarec mountains and hillsbrad have mountain lions to farm.   
---
They are the highest level mobs that drop lion meat I believe. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3731/lion-meat
---
Earth elementals there are a lot in the badlands (lower level in the north, higher levels south) - can't answer about the nature resist.
---
Other good grinding options will depend a bit on your professions, but any humanoid is good (ogres in badlands etc), or beasts if you can skin them.  
---
You just got to find something you can kill quick and there are enough so you aren't waiting on respawns.  
---
But having said that, 40+ quests often start giving 1g+ as rewards so money will start to fly in fast if you just keep questing and pick up a mount 1-2 levels late
---
Ah,  I figured it'd handle mouseover, but didn't know it stored past each session; so it's like Prat, where Prat will show the player level of the last time it scanned that player (ie /who, guild, party, mouseover [by the looks of it]).
---
is there no detriment to the rest of the team if there's a much higher level player grouped?
---
Razorgore seems to be very balanced. The estimates I've seen vary between 55/45 to horde to an even 50/50 split.
---
Thanks Manny ;)
---
I believe that faction specific queues would work out best. You can still choose any server but it would mitigate the amount of people logged on at once
---
80k honor, phase 2 sucks
---
itll depend on how hard others are going at it. when i did it back in the day the final week from 13-14 was me playing 16+ hours a day for the week. before that it was not horrid because of how our server honor farm group was set up 
---
the absolute fastest you can hit R14 is 12 weeks and that is if you are in the top server rank every week. realistically it will take you 6 months to grind it out
---
With your point of view it's kind of a Win / win situation so it's pretty nice. I personnaly stopped playing not even because of griefieng just the impossibility to have chill activity like farming / questing anymore. Which I often like to do
---
1. U dont need to even learn your resistance totems while leveling.
---
It recommended you wait like 18 to account for server response and lag
---
First paragraph I mention that it would be for the overpopulated faction only.
---
To no one’s surprise the horde exploiting the game
---
I think if it’s in the game it should be allowed
---
I just came back after a month break. Went from 49-50 with rested and ony buff in 2 hoursish. Decided this is the only way to level now haha
---
I might actually play the game again if they release bg's.
---
Sounds like Gandling - EU
---
P6 will separate thouse who can farm mats to clear Naxx from thouse, who can't.
---
i think atlas loot has it in phase 5. so that could be why
---
Ok.
---
It's so funny when I'm in hillsbrad on my 60 doing world pvp and see some unflagged level 28 dudes walking through the chaos just trying to find some bears to kill lol
---
you are worth exactly 0 honor for 1min after landing so this is no way of honor farming
---
God I felt this
---
PSA: If a service offers 2FA; **use it**.
---
Seriously, it's more a pain to recover an account or your money than it is to put in a 6-10 digit code.
---
Pushing 60 from 50
---
haha your not missing out on anything
---
Mmm I'll let my raid know, but they seem to like me.
---
They're shitty for being on the roof, you're shitty for having Spy.
---
This is where I am. I rolled a rogue specifically to choose my own battles and that means stealthing the long way into a zone sometimes rather than fly. Spy has messed that up and I’m grinding more than questing, moving zones a lot, but I’m still having fun. 
---
However, I absolutely understand those who are miserable and empathize with them and I’m more bothered by the people who dismiss their frustration than I am by the actual griefing. 
---
And the people who complain about the people complaining are still complaining, themselves.
---
Good luck, just know that when you finish it you will be pretty happy with yourself, and you will have a newfound understanding and love for the universe!
---
I want to contribute my dose of salt.
---
this is how it worked 15 years ago. just google the fucking honor system 
---
fuck it ill post it for you just read and look at the spreadsheet. thats how it works. deal with it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dswpr6/honorsystem_amount_of_time_to_reach_rank_14_etc/
---
Hunters are topping the charts in my raids. There are usually at least 2 (of our 4-5) in the top 5 since you can reset your threat every 30 seconds
---
There is only 1 type of ranking points. And you lose those for DKs. I never fucking said you'll lose honorable kills for it...
---
Back up into MGE in csgo
---
just get the fuck out of here hahaha
---
I noticed this as well!  
---
I always jump down the stairs so I thought I was just imagining it.
---
Nice. Usually takes me a full weekend as well to rack up a couple.
---
Dead meat.
---
&gt;So a game you don't like 
---
U want me to check how much time played i've got on my both my 60 warriors combined... gimme a break. It's because of how much i've enjoyed some aspects that make me care enough to talk about the aspects i don't enjoy.
---
Seriously, this isn't rocket science.
---
Warrior paladin is a great combo.   Both melee and mail/plate means you are both really tanky and buff each others damage.  
---
Warrior itself is an amazing levelling class if they have just a little backup to throw them the odd heal.
---
Hunter - well it will be decent because hunter is already super strong on its own.  But not much synergy between them.
---
Sounds like you want a paladin. Can still tank and has a variety of utility for any occasion with your friends.
---
In his name.
---
It’s not a must to lead just because you’re tanking. There’s always another one that knows more than you, even after you’ve been playing for 15years. 
---
So if you’re planning and want to tank, go on and level a warrior. Just a heads-up, that warriors are one of the slowest and hardest to level up. And most expansive. But if you’re planning ahead your way through the zones it’s really not a problem. 
---
Levelled a warrior in Vanilla and levelled one in Classic. Absolutely loving it! You’re always appreciated in groups :)
---
And that’s why you should play one, if you never do how will you learn, people will help you’ll encounter assholes but most will help also you can two hand tank anyway 
---
Think about it this, basically nobody new how to tank when the game first came out.
---
It’s about playing what you want and how you want you enjoy the game in your own way
---
I did the push and pull back SS/TM raid on Thursday and found it quite boring as well. 
---
The smaller skirmishes at like Menethil Harbor were definitely more fun and it makes me want to /pass on pvp until BGs come out. 
---
Also
---
&gt; “i’ll come to bed in 5 minutes.” 
---
Just add a half hour to anything you're doing, and the timing will be better lol. "let me just hearth"
---
Oh, didnt know locks and hunts offer these runs for 20-25g. Not that expensive tbh.
---
I mean, everyone with a brain knows most people really wanted bg' pvp. World PVP was barely a thing back in the day, and the people you're talking about are an extreme minority of players. They just happen to be really vocal about it.
---
Learn to read.
---
I didnt say "you'll lose honorable kills"
---
I said "Honor"
---
As in your ranking
---
Did you aoe farm ZF for the mount? I tried it a few times but it's unbearable.
---
Yeah, I always put those people on ignore
---
Yes, check out the reset timer.

I've played WoW for a very very long time. Vanilla, BC, WotLK, Cata, and WoD and now Classic. As well as tons of pservers. And I can count on my fingers how many raids I've done. A lot of people think the game is about "end game raid content", but it's really not true. It's an MMORPG. It's about enjoying the game from start to finish. I would say the game for me, in terms of enjoyment, is: 30% low level dungeons, 20% questing, 20% chillin in guild chat, 15% pvp, 10% helping lowbies, 3% professions, and 2% raiding. 
---
It's all about finding what you like, broski.
---
I prefer the improved concentration aura, rogues really aren’t the most difficult class to fight as a paladin imo, but it’s mostly to benefit the group I’m in. It also helps immensely when a fast attack hunter pet is on you and you need to heal (healing while collecting reck charges vs hunter pets).
---
Defense in general as ret reck is a waste but again this is imo, an extra 0.4% dodge and 0.4% parry is negligeable for 5 points. When I’m prot/ holy to aoe tank or farm then anticipation is worth it, since I’m stacking def anyway.
---
But you should run the builds you prefer I just shared what I prefer.
---
You're forgeting that Before that happened Undead Racial was the best and was still considered very strong in comparison to Human Racial.
---
Not applicable. The character has no tangible value. You can sell the house. Which if you really hate your neighbors, yes, is a viable thing to do.
---
You mean last wiping member.
---
oof. I felt that xd
---
No one is turning down rogues and DPS warriors because they're worried a mage item will go to waste.
---
Don't be dense.
---
They'd be happy to have a blue to vendor.
---
My Druid got his Wild Growth Spaulders 😎
---
Talk to them and ask if they'd consider helping you out in those dungeons. It's going to be a good learning experience for you as well, any dungeon details you don't know they can fill you in on so you don't have to hear it in all caps from a hormone-and-Red bull-high 15yo when you do one mistake. Well, slight exaggeration, but could happen. Win-win in any case!
---
PvP server, horde outnumber us 2 to 1 by estimate. Was level 54 when honor went live. Just hit 60 today.
---
This happens if you started a run (and sadly remains once the run is finished). It actually does the who call but you need to open the gui window to see the result.
---
I respect the shit out of this.
---
There are servers where the alliance has a numbers advantage, so look beyond your own experience.
---
There are more than one addon for it, think it's in Leatrix Plus
---
How will I get ganked on a PvE server.
---
I’ve been trying this at 43, mainly with full 12 grave pulls because I’m greedy lol. Always end up with a couple of resists throughout and can’t recover :/
---
How often do your runs have 3 successful pulls?
---
the xp on arena runs is shit tho
---
Played level 52-59 just doing dungeons.  Acquired 3/4 of the materials+ the pattern that I need for robe of arch mage.  Picked up a bunch of pre raid bis, some have eluded me in a really bad way.
---
Overall very productive week, when I get in to MC and Ony this week I’m hoping most of the mages in my guild already have everything that they need.
---
Uh what?  I have had fun.  It's a past perfect tense.  Now that phase two is out everyone is having less fun.  No one, not even them expected this because this is not how vanilla was.  These bloated servers should have faction queues if they're gonna swing this bad.  There was obviously a big discussion about transferring servers.  The issue is blizz won't let you transfer to a balanced server, only a dead one.  So it doesn't fix the problem.
---
With friends you can do it lower level, but pugs will unlikely take you for anything except DME, lbrs 55+ and Scholo 58+.
---
Whoa, your right!
---
AHHHH! This! I did it on my rogue for the first time and was crushing on the meters, was moving as a pack with the other melee, was feeling good about myself. Then all of a sudden dead... I was standing behind some other melees while we were all grouping and I couldn’t figure out wtf happened. This must of been it, I’ll have to keep a better eye for this next time.
---
We used to call those averse to PVP care bears. Is that still a thing?
---
I am frankly pissed because phase 2 cost me a lot of money. Red Dead Redemption 2 is $60...
---
Most of the people who are butt-hurt about how the game is now "unplayable" are absolutely unwilling to do something so radical as play on a PvE server.
---
Sounds like something Kromkrush horde would do. Bunch of animals. No sympathy.
---
But in reality that does suck. Horrible guild that one. Could try and a name and shame em on your side. But then again, it's a bunch of horde with no civility :P
---
cause of pvp ques when bgs arrive
---
Cross server though.
---
Spy add onn is the equivalent of FPS wall hacking. its totally unfair and makes it so people can corpse camp me without standing a chance.
---
Yeah shit sucks man. I definitely knew what I was getting into, I just didn’t know it was this bad. I’ll check that guide out
---
Seems like an obvious thing.
---
My fav kill was when I landed on the tiny island with the hut on Sanhok. I got a double barrel shotgun and nothing else. I waited for 15 mins in the hut and someone finally showed up, so I gave him both barrels.
---
I underestimated it as I didn't read what will be released in which phase. I just knew that p1 was MC and ony and honor was p2. However, I expected that this implied BGs as well. But it didn't cross my mind to release honor without BG as that would mean ruin to all lvl 50 areas.
---
Also, when my group of friends started playing we choose a pvp server as some in my group liked pvp and I didn't say much against it. Because I was under the impression that BGs would release at the same time honor did, I didn't think it would be as bad as it is now.
---
None, stuck on 56 shadow priest. Not logging in anymore. I stopped 3 sub's (my kids too).
---
How is that name not offensive? People have been banned for a lot less
---
&gt;thouse
---
You said it was an honor penalty and that honor and rank points are 'the same thing'. Both of those are wrong.
---
min-maxing for bc?
---
you do realise phase 2 was just released?
---
run to blasted lands logout and unsub
---
Ohh I see. Sorry I didn't get that I thought 
---
&gt;Master Looter was not able to grab the loot,
---
Simply meant you weren't able to loot it.
---
Well I'd say Report to Blizz then?!
---
Underrated comment
---
Playing on a PvE server locks you out of a massive part of the game and classics PvE is far below LFR in terms of difficulty, so enjoy running out of content within a day in an empty and soulless world without pvp
---
Dude, you're on a reddit post being a  cry baby with people disagreeing with you.
---
Your path also has to have multiple points, if it’s a straight path you won’t stop anywhere
---
Hey guys, I'm playing a human combat rogue and I use a Brutality Blade in my MH and Mirah's song in my OH.   
---
Last MC run I recieved Core hound tooth, should I replace my Mirah's song with it ?   
---
Thank you.
---
They'd definitely agree to come along - I'd just rather not ask till I'm sure I am up to the task ;)
---
they are still called that but this subreddit is a kind of safespace
---
The block chances could be nice but I would go for maximum aggro and would go further down the fury tree, or you can event try a fury prot spec if you're willing to pay 1g  (Sry I don't have the specifics on le rn but you can find it anywhere very easily)
---
Fury prot should be a well geared raid spec but in your case for the dou''ungrons you're aiming for it should do the job just fine
---
&gt;Evasion is a no-go against warriors due to Overpower
---
This isn’t true. Watch the rogues in CDL if you need proof. 
---
Dodging most incoming damage outside of 2 Overpowers is absolutely worth it.
---
Sure, when mobs starts to Evade it's fine, but as soon as you evade the mobs GMs get involved.
---
No.
---
Good thing, I'm rogue and can stay good without this gear KEKW ofc
---
Yeah, that name definitely has connotations of...  something else. Whether intentional or not. 
---
Better start thinking of something else. I predict a forced name change in your future.

Yeah he covered that here:
---
&gt;unless it's a bad loot council.
---
Nothing to do with get good, I’ve killed enough people, it’s just boring, but keep insulting, says a lot about you.
---
I don’t say open PvP should be limited, I even think dishonorable killing should be removed, war is war. But people shouldn’t be encouraged and rewarded for griefing.
---
#nochanges is bullshit, they already changed stuff.
---
lol I dont watch that neckbeard at all just not a sperg like you and many others that simply cant play the game around one of the easiest classes to solo.
---
I'm not even sure what that comment is supposed to mean but clearly it means something to you, leads me to believe your more likely to be a sub to him than I am considering you mentioned him instantly with absolutely nothing else referencing him lol.
---
Go get fucking slammed by scrubs some more, kids like you bitching in general all day really light me up about how bad you are.
---
You seem completely relaxed and laid back. I like your heartful spirit and the joy you share :)
---
Can someone explain to me what all this talk about phase 2 means? I assume it has something to do with some PVP changes? 
---
I noticed I have been getting ganked a lot more but I figured it was just bad luck.
---
Why can't the Alliance get up on the roof as well?
---
I really love your attitude. Yeah i would probably just keep playing casually if i were richer or the game were F2P but atm my interest isn't as high. When/if i come back i'll probably just be like u and accept that that part of the game isn't for me and just stick to the stuff i do like.
---
With Hunter you're a strong independant player that can do most of the content alone, you can solo most things, you're good in pvp, you can easily farm ressource, you can make money, it easy to play and hard to master.
---
With warior you're a strong very dependant player, you're going to struggle with a lot of content, you can't solo most things, you're not very good in pvp before you have stuff and even then require a constant healer/dispell (but when you do you're probably the best), you can't farm easily ressource and make money (except if you have a duo), it not easy to play and hard to master. Tank is in high demand for dungeon, not for raid, but warior is a very good raid dps (with rogue equipment)
---
So the choice is mostly about what kind of players you are, if you always are going to play with people and a healer and are willing to exp a reroll for farm ressource warior is the good choice. If you like doing solo stuff then hunter is the choice
---
Dinged 60 last Friday, first MC raid and got extra lucky with 2 Tier pieces as well as The Eye of Divinity. Granted, owning Benediction in classic is like holding up a “gank me” sign.

You knew you weren't talking about spell penetration when you made that name.
---
Yesterday horde took over the menethil harbor boat/dock/fp and started camping lowbies there.  It sure felt good getting a group going and wiping them to take it all back.  Not sure you can get that on a PVE realm

blizzard can do whatever they want with or in the game

---
Those of us with 10000IQ didn't give in to the pvp hype at launch and started on PVE servers because we knew theyd be total aids come phase 2. 
---
Congratulations on your move though.
---
Not upset, certainly not as upset as the OPs guildmate who made the meme in the first place.
---
Just been hearing this mouth breathing opinion spewed a lot and it deserves the ridicule.
---
If you are getting stomped around by a warrior 1v1 you are legit fucking shit at this game and probably need reminders to continuously breath.
---
How is spell F@#KING PENETRATION not offensive? WHO exactly does it offend? I am just frustrated right now.
---
It affects only those in the party, not the raid.  Not everyone needs the reduction.  Also, your shamans aren't always standing near the dps or need to be with casters for mana totems
---
Definetely warrior as it will be an amazing combo will levelling (reminding you the honor système is out and the pex areas are literals battlegrounds)
---
And at 60 you'll still be complementary, as if you spec tank you only need 3 dps to go dungeons, and in pvp you'll be able to break a few skull if you team up
---
Quests
---
Wait.  Those drop from fishing?  Gd
---
Our MT is arguably best on the server, but the 2nd/3rd tank were relatively new as we broke into 2 groups. Will recommend this.
---
If it's bannable to interfere with same factions for world bosses, than this is def bannable.

All the best players are unemployed playing all the time. The best option is after 6am. They are too demotivated with life to get up before noon so thats the best time to play. Not too early though, 5am and you'll catch the all nighters.
---
We had some rogues pulling really highly on the DPS meters, and yes they were getting stomped. We were oddly mage light, only 2 (!) although we had 6 hunters and 5 warlocks.
---
Except it's not, honor isn't the same as rank points.
---
but its not lol
---
So they're just being jerks then? Good to know.
---
Lots of horde rogues doing this on Herod in Ironforge
---
😆
---
&gt; a month to 2 months of work again
---
That wouldn't even be P3, we'd be lucky to have BGs by then. Plenty of time.
---
&gt;"re roll or quit" its been their mantra for 15 years,they don't care if their server becomes dead,they don't care if the game dies
---
And maybe that's why there's such a stigma against PvE servers, just ganker-propaganda, who knows.
---
That's pretty much what they do. I used to setup and script for private servers for years, I know how it works. Of course there are some servers putting much work into it, but it's still a small amount compared to developing the entire game.
---
&gt; Frankly, I don't think playing 1.5 classic would have been a whole lot of fun.
---
In your opinion.
---
I know literally hundreds of people personally that would have had an absolute blast if Classic started in 1.1.
---
......  
---
i cant find the energy to comment on this normally anymore.
---
your post is going to be downvoted   
---
k thx bye
---
You ok, hun ?
---
Ok but ytho
---
Which would suck...because CensusPlus default is 'start scan' when first installed.
---
...boils down to this is just too much of a hassle, which is what Blizzard probably wanted. - It's wasn't until **after** it was reported that Classic had some 2 million players that suddenly "we need to move the who command to protected; for 'reasons'".
---
As a holy priest, everytime theres a druid in the group i feel 10x safer
---
&gt;People in Vanilla didn't know how ranking worked.
---
You're right, I'm sure all the GM/HW farm groups had no idea what they were doing
---
Also be on a server where the other faction will 100% not try to stop.
---
Yep, I’m on the dark side now too. Killing women and children too... poor lvl 48...
---
If you hang out in Dire Maul general chat long enough you're bound to find a hunter selling the mace.
---
I've seen steamers do an even 1000 on a fireblast, that not surprising. The CoC numbers you're quoting aren't possible. Even adding curse of elements, v which you wouldn't have in a pvp environment.
---
&gt; I’m a level 57 Horde on a pretty evenly distributed server. Horde have a slight population edge. Alliance dominate server world PvP and constantly KoS any Horde player. It’s the same god damn thing with the Horde KoS’ing any Alliance. It goes both ways. 
---
Please name your server when you make these posts. It's impossible to consider these without checking if the claims are true.
---
I'm a pussy cuz I haven't set wow as my top priority in life? Get a grip dude. You've taken a fun game and turned it into an unhealthy addiction.
---
I have a reroll 50s alliance warrior and everyone quits.
---
With my 17 HK, I'll get rank 14 for sure!
---
I'll be there I'm getting by I just keep seeing people leaving left and right. We were clearing MC and ony with 2 40 mans. Now we cant even fill out a 40 man without finding pugs. I am still moving along I like a challenge anyway but some dont and if it keeps on going like this no ones going to get geared enough to do raids and they gonna leave. Before this we were 60/40. Since then I swear it's getting closer to 90/10. And I havent subbed for retail since 110 and before that it was wrath
---
Honestly, the most excitement I get is when I chain parry/miss/dodges/blocks. I've had shielded humanoid mobs 3 levels lower than me parry me, then dodge, then ill miss my overpower, then my next attack is parried again or blocked. So. Much. Fun.
---
I feel like for Alliance it's Gnomes. Every single Alliance I see, I swear, is a Gnome. If not a Gnome then a Dwarf Paladin or Priest.
---
That's cause by the time you've gotten half the way down the page reading some guys ancestry, you've forgotten who you were even reading about.
---
Main problem is the Paladins and Shamans. The idea could work if it were not for faction specific classes.
---
Converting gear would be hard if you wanted to suggest converting Paladins into Shamans, and vice versa.
---
I don't get why so many players need to justify why they pick x or z or why they are rerolling.
---
Just do what make you enjoy the game, no need to read an essay about it
---
Thanks man, but for some reason it doesn't show CCs, tried it in several duels
---
Is there any mass sub cancellation at all?
---
Shadow priests off heal like crazy with vampiric embrace
---
I understand the idea if you want more direct keybindings. But every time I have tried it out I think it feels very awkward to maintain movement control while using the shift and ctrl modifier for if I move my movement keys over. But I have never understood how anyone could ever use alt as a modifer for anything even remotely usefull in combat I find it impossible to use alt while strafing with A or D för example.
---
Heck yea - those lowbies are going to try harder than everyone else. They are like "oh shit i got invited to an all 60 group, i better not fuck up!"
---
Do some chaotic good and carry a noob.
---
This is common knowledge to the people who farmed him for HOJ, that's why you can duo it easily with rogue and druid or double rogue.
---
I wouldn’t sleep on the str for bear too, str will directly effect how much threat you generate so it’s definitely a worthwhile stat for someone interested in tanking still

Btw im pretty sure Unyielding Maul is 12% drop, not 3%, from the Tribute run
---
Did pvp first time around and just dont have to time to burn on a pvp server. 
---
It was fun when I could play 3-5 hrs each day and little to no IRL things that had to get done. 
---
With 2-3 hrs and only 2-3 days, I had to pass this time around as I just didnt want to be that lvl50+ honor boar! 🤣
---
While the pve is /lolz its still fun to BS with folks and have a sense of community with the folks I have meet while leveling.
---
The person’s feelings were hurt and you didn’t care.  Regardless of the situation and whether or not you thought that was funny or not.  Then you thought it was worth posting here to make more fun of him.  That’s the headline here, and you are just bullying.
---
Go to help in the menu and there is a tab to submit a ticket.
---
What do you expect? The community has been toxic for years, and now you jam them into a few servers. Remember, the game has the same people who play League of Legends and Fortnite. And the internet itself has changed over the past 15 years, both culturally and generational-ly. The best you can do is try to find a mature group of players in a guild, and block out the rest of the WoW-world :)
---
Hue hue hue. Griefing other players is asshole behavior.

If you're that determined, getting to level 10 on retail takes like a few minutes.

I remember reading that Retri Paladin is very(?) good in PvP.

Well that’s your choice to dislike him, but he’s quite an intelligent person regarding WoW.
---
This needs to be in some kind of EULA box before you can create a character on a PvP server.
---
Three types of people on pvp servers right now:
---
1) This is the best thing ever, I love ganking across all zones
---
2) I dislike this but it's a price I'm willing to pay for a server that has more freedom and player agency.
---
3) I'm an idiot who rolled a pvp server even though I can't take being killed while I'm pveing.  I wish I was on a pve server or playing a nice single player game.
---
Ony currently resets monday morning, so if you do it today, it's still the same reset on sunday.

How much hit are you running?  Is one enchanted/not enchanted?

I loved arenas in bc
---
There are these things called PVE servers.  Just saying
---
Not a lot of fantastic options. I’m currently rocking the +30 STR pummler from DM W I think.
---
Probably a horde player, that's juste the way the horde Handle honour, killing civilian is highly regarded. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up bombing city with civilian or burnin historical landmark with civil citizen inside in the near future ...
---
Free action potion is scary i tell you.
---
They were definitely bad luckily for me :)
---
No he wouldn't. It's true that he'd probably enjoy a character in the same state as his current pvp one more, but we're not talking about him playing the same character on a different type of server, we're talking about paying the upfront cost of playing a character like that (leveling and all the grinding he's done for his progress so far) again. It is entirely possible for that prospect to not be worth it without bringing "sunk cost fallacy" into it. High barriers of entry of investment are not subject to sunk cost fallacy in quite the way you imagine it.
---
Just because you made a big upfront investment of time into a character that is now providing less return (enjoyment) than it could be, doesn't justify making another big upfront investment for something providing better longterm return.
---
Short term has value. You're entirely discounting the requirements of the leveling process.
---
They could be ignorant as well. The "Estimated Honor" does not take repeat kills into account, so they could believe they get honor even if they don't
---
Just going off wowhead or whatever site I found it on but 12% would be much better if that's true
---
Phase 2 havent been out for like 1 full week, and people are going apeshit... because they are being butt hurt  
---
Maybe people are just overreacting and didnt really knew what pvpRealm ment.  
---
I dont care about all these post.  
---
They are wrong, and they didnt used real transfer and now they are crying... good for them
---
Shadowburn is my vote. It is a fantastic spell in its own right and feels so so good when it crits.
---
It is also your best spell for tagging pvper for honor
---
&gt;Basically playing on a PvE server is not the way the game was intended to be played
---
What about playing on a PvP server with 5x the players on vanilla servers?
---
Can I use this to auto buy recipes from vendors?

Can I use this to auto buy recipes that only stock every few hours.

That was the first proper dungeon situation that I couldn't handle healing as an enhancement-specced Shaman (pre-level 60 though). Just not enough mana.

This was your mistake in phase 2.  You seem to be still in the phase 1 mindset.
---
When we joined classic we were in a guild called &lt;Decent&gt; whose objective it was to be semi-casual and raid after hitting 60. Queue people no lifing the game for 2 weeks, hitting 60, want to raid but dont want to help people level AT ALL --- 
---
Guild folds into another guild that only takes the level 60s and everyone else gets fucked. 
---
feelsgoodman.jpg. But honeslty wouldnt want to play with those kinds of players anyway. My new GM loaned me 35G for my mount without blinking and has regularly flown across the entire world to come to STV to help with a quest. 
---
THATS the kinda guild I wanna be part of.
---
This tip is wrong, it's better to sit in a cave and mob grind than quest, atleast your xp bar actually moves.
---
*Pick up group group*
---
irrelevant. turned out half the bullshit he talked about in his videos were false and he didnt even manage to stomach playing and leveling classic, swiftly returned to being a nice and friendly BfA blizzard propaganda tool.
---
I used to watch his videos a lot but he got the same issue as most other "famous" internet people, he let the popularity go to his head and now he thinks hes the jesus of wow or something.

See: retail

Lol ok

Oh, I'm just going for Anticipation because it's the least 'not useless' talent to get to Reckoning's tier. - Hunters, in the past, just Viper me until I'm OOM anyways, so healing is usually not possible. :P
---
It's not really about toxicity imho, more like apathy.

Who wants to be a Human Warrior named Steve when you can be an Orc Warrior named Targg and crush the skulls of your enemies.

I was a GM for years. The majority of them don't get robes. They all have the power to appear, however. Even the ones with robes aren't supposed to appear to players anymore. During old Vanilla/BC times we could do it. 
---
This person probably got in trouble with his boss.
---
&gt; Server identity is out of the window now. Who cares if they play on *"this-or-that"* server anymore. We just want faction **BALANCE.** 
---
I didn't know you were chosen to speak for all players.
---
God forbid wanting to spend your playtime actually playing the game instead of getting farmed by neckbeards who base their entire self worth on their PVP rank in a 15 year old game.
---
Not quite true. I got ganked on a pve server lately.
---
A dude challenges me to a duel, and split second before it starts, he hits macro canceling it and turning pvp flag on.  I charged and his friends ganked me. Damn you alliance cowards!
---
I think you will enjoy it more with a different class. Playing a different role and challenging yourself. Raids are fun if you don’t focus on loot but progression with the guild. I do dungeons for both gear and gold and player interactions. Rather than join parties try to create a party and socialise with the party to improve the dungeon exp. if ppl are getting ganked maybe go help lowbies in low level areas while doing profession stuff. You gotta find your own style of playing. 
---
I like farming chest and mobs in WPL and do some world pvp between routes. One dungeon a night as well. Keep it simple.
---
Phases are killing classic in an attempt to stretch out the money funnel
---
World pvp happens on PvE servers too so idk what you're going on about
---
Hillsbrad has been back and forth non-stop on my PvE server since Thursday. Only difference is I can choose to unflag and do other things in peace if I want.
---
Yeah you can, just reroll.
---
People acting like it's such an imposition to make a new character.
---
Rip in peace dude
---
MC? Just MindBlast the shit out of him.
---
How would they attack him? Even he isn't a gm he is still marked as horde
---
I really don’t think you’re correct on this matter, but hey to each their own as I’ve said.
---
Oh? And I used to joke about warlocks trading DPS for durability.
---
Enjoy your downvotes my dude
---
Look at this guy over here, assuming I play horde just to make his whining seem justified.
---
&gt; Just because you made a big upfront investment of time into a character that is now providing less return (enjoyment) than it could be, doesn't justify making another big upfront investment for something providing better longterm return.
---
This is literally the sunk cost fallacy.
---
* I sunk a lot of cost (time) into this thing. So I have to stick it out even if I could get better returns (enjoyment) elsewhere.
---
Have a dwarf pally in our guild that does this.
---
He's 100% right about the hunter bit. 
---
Hunters can solo DM North Tribute runs fairly easily. We skip all the mobs and kill the final boss and spawn the chest. We can then sell the chest items to any player who joins our group; all we do is escort them to the chest, avoiding a few aggroable mobs and perhaps invis pot/stealthing past others. 
---
I almost always vendor my Unyielding Mauls now because there's no market in them.
---
Just stand inside your own DM North or East instance (to avoid potential ganking) and /1 WTB Unyielding Maul. I can almost guarantee you, during prime time, you'll only need to stand there an hour at most to get it. Offer 30g, loot your weapon, and be on your way.
---
I hate to throw shade, but you're on point. Most quiet time on the server is about 5 am -&gt; noon. Most populated is 5 pm - midnight. 
---
People with regular 8-4/9-5 jobs play from about 5 - midnight. 
---
People with no jobs play from about noon - 3/4 am.
---
Hell yes my dude, 9/10 times the last person needed to a dungeon is the tank, unless the tank+healer started the group.
---
I was Skeram Horde I moved to Heartseeker. If they merged the two we would have long queues and probably a 60h/40a split. We have around 10k auctions on the horde side on Heartseeker and you can go solo to any zone and kill tons of alliance. Our top earner that I saw yesterday was at 140k honor with another 600 dual kills for today on Monday, just a warrior shaman able to run into groups of 5-6 and destroy them. Even solo I have killed a group of 3.
---
We are waiting to see what raiding is like today as Kargath has been camped by 3-4 40 man raids since Friday. Another great honor location you run to the outskirts and run away 3-5 normally follow you to your kill squad and repeat. According to that warcraft logs parser we are at 85/15 split based on how many people have logged.
---
Not sure if you missed the point but I think he meant free faction transfers like Horde -&gt; Alliance and vice versa.  That way if the queues are bothering you too much you can choose to switch faction and not be in the faction with a queue.  This would IMO be a good solution IF they don't say "can stop at any time for any reason" because that would scare most guilds from trying to coordinate a move due to the risk of splitting the guild in half.
---
Plus 5% base = 30%
---
10 days played to get to level 48? what the fuck?
---
From the Blizzard forum for Classic I would say that is a real possibility.
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/wow-classic-discussion

I never found aoe’ing worth it as a paladin. Even prot spec you can only fight 2-3 mobs at once before they overwhelm you.
---
Consecration is such high mana for so little damage
---
Enjoy never opening AQ.
---
But you dont lose honor lmao
---
Sorry you misunderstood the consequences of deciding on a PvP server, but the veterans all knew this was coming, and made sure they were prepared.
---
It's not hard to find people to kill on those servers. There will always be people trying to move through BRM. You can make the argument that it isn't fun to fight 20 v 5 but the reality is that most of the people you see posting here telling you to roll PvE want exactly that. They don't want a fair fight, they want to absolutely smash their enemy completely with 0% chance of losing. They are trash at the game and it fucking shows when guilds start organizing to go to MC.
---
&gt;if I pay I must be able to do \_\_\_ on my terms. Not on the terms of the game.

That's usually how decline starts in game design.

Went into MC as 59 Resto Sham.

If you don't enjoy it, then it isn't for you.
---
The draw of gear isn't why I raid, it's to do the thing.  Gear makes it easier, and allows you to do more things, but it's doing the thing itself.  It's the same thing with any video game.  If you don't enjoy the gameplay of Dark Souls or a Batman game, why continue to play it?  Do you only play it to get more gadgets for Batman or make new weapons in Dark Souls?  Most people play it because they enjoy the gameplay and want to "win".  Not everyone is like that and some people want their reward for doing the thing.
---
Just caught "The 1 Ring". Should I wait till BGs to sell it?
---
Nothing
---
I can confirm that 0/30/21 specc is viable in the current phase of classic. On a personal note I prefer some adjustments though: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505050130302015-05502300501
---
I played as tank in all dungeons with this specc and as healer in Molten Core and Ony Raids. Raiding as tank without clearcast from Omen of Clarity is a significant threat generation loss. It will affect tanking in dungeons as well, but to a lesser extent. Communicate with your DPS and try to save rage in between pulls (kill critters, seriously!!! extend combat and thus lessen your rage decay out of combat Enrage etc.)
---
Dungeons are harder to heal with this specc, because you will lack the 50% crit talent for Regrowth and Swiftmend for emergy instant heals. Healing in MC/Ony should be a mix of downranked rank 3 / 4 / 5 healing touch anyway, especially if there is another druid with the usual Swiftmend Healing Build (depending on your + healing amount).
---
That's what I've been doing I dont mind the fights  the raid groups usually are getting followed so they call out in chat where they are going. I like the extra dangerous situations. I've seen so many people quit lately we had 2 40 man raids with enough fillins to almost make a 3rd raid group before this we aren't even getting enough to fill 1 raid group now I think the numbers for ony was 28 people showed up
---
Sorry you didn't understand what you were getting into 240 hours ago, and now regret *your own* decision.
---
Huh, I've been there many times and never saw any. Must've been unlucky.
---
It's not their fault they got the loot...
---
2 months isn't much considering classic is planned for a couple years.
---
I would generally agree with you on the CoC kiting bit. I CoC kite pretty vigorously at times depending on who I'm fighting. I would argue it's situational dependent though depending on gear, environment, etc. Generally though, they see my CoC kiting and try to react, but i just hit them with a nova then ram my CoC up their ass
---
They do decent burst damage, are plate wearers, can heal themselves, and have a get out of gank free card.
---
Pretty good combination IMO.
---
Really? Cause I was on here a lot and didn't see people warning about a 4:1 Horde imbalance. Odd.
---
Most cities have more guards.
---
Horde flight points are mostly central on the map.
---
In STV there is a single flight point for alliance, in booty bay. There is no boat or zeppelin leading there for ally.
---
Oh stfu
---
I've played on PVP servers since TBC including multiple private servers as both horde and ally, it's never been this fucking bad
---
Tried to help out a friend in BRD last night, land at thorium point &gt; instantly killed, corpse walk all the way to BRM gates because of overwhelming number of hordes (about 8 deaths), then die inside to the 20 hordes just camping there all day, jump down to the lava, another 6 people camping there, run back and rez below, die to 3 rogues inside the quarry 3 times before i made it in
---
The only people who say this shit are either on the dominating faction or play on a PVE server. World PVP was never this cancerous in all my 10+ years of playing wow. Factions are extremely imbalanced and there are way too many people online
---
Ya that spot has been there for 15 years, weird right?
---
Yeah, I'm in that camp too.  Damage = threat and also faster clears.  Mitigation is meh in terms of dungeons even fully blue'd out you're technically overgeared.
---
I never had enough gold to buy an epic mount (PvE Specced Holy Priest). I had to get the Rank 11 PvP Mounts because they were cheaper.
---
(now before people say I could have grinded money for a mount in less time, I could not effectively solo any elites without using my entire mana bar and sitting and drinking after every mob. My BF at the time was also grinding to GM and "would help me get my mount after he hits Grand Marshal" so at that point, I was already like rank 6-7 and then had two other guildies who wanted to be Grand Marshal, and at that point I was like 8-9, so I just finished that grind to 11.)
---
P.S. He also did not help me grind cash for an epic. Lol. He actually left our guild to join a higher end raiding guild because "GM daggers."
---
I’ll have to check these guides out, thanks!!
---
cc'ing/clicking the pike makes it decently easy.

I'm not seeing how is this better from normal gdkp. Let's say compared to an open simultaneous bid where the highest bidder pays the second highest bid.

I took my time, sue me
---
Does that mean for.dungeons I woll have to choose between being a dedicated tank or healer?
---
Not everyone plays as much as you do nor have the time to reroll a character if they've already invested in a level 60 toon.
---
On my server the two types of alcohol dropped by the treasure quest sell for 1g ea
---
I see you gather before me.. hungry... terrified..
---
They gave NEs a detarget too. That wasn't too bad for pvp.
---
I had a resto druid alt I used to love pissing people off herbing terocone in front of them and flying away in bird form. That type of farming was OP but I loved the shit out of it. I will not go outside for the rest of my life if they bring back TBC as well.
---
Thank you. Amen.
---
Retail exists, Retail is available for the exact same subscribed account as Classic.
---
There is exactly -EXACTLY- ZERO reason to complain. If you want the Retail design, play on goddamn Retail.
---
Nobody cares, it's fine, I play on both just fine, it's completely allowed and possible.
---
There is exactly 0 reason to change anything to how world pvp works here. It's tough, annoying etc well here you go : your very own vanilla experience.
---
On Kirtonos and this happens. It’s a med-high pop server with no streamers (that I’m aware of)
---
&gt;Anyone who knew anything about Classic knew what to expect. Not Vanilla but actual Classic in the current gaming climate.
---
With the name reservations going the way they did (basically making mega servers), the announcement of phases that separated honor from BG's, implementation of layering and stated removal goals before phase 2(more people), the very common stated goal of rank 14 by players...
---
Just to give that comment context. If I had thought about it, I might have known. But I'm not going to claim that. I'm going to claim that I remember what it was like leveling when everyone else was already 60. I like PvP... I really like PvP... I had rank 10, and all the PvP rep grinds done before I stepped foot inside MC. But I don't like it all the time. I really don't like it when I'm trying to do something else.
---
So I rolled PvE this time around. I'm so glad I missed the mess that is PvP servers right now.
---
... How the fuck did you know!
---
warcraftlogs.  
---
But also pressence in any contested zone. Go to any zone you'd like and you'll generally see more horde running around than alliance at any given time.

What are you talking about? How is this in anyway us bullying him?

The fat joke was literally about his ingame character being to big to fit on the tiny platform safe spot. If you can't handle that kind of a joke in an MMO you shouldn't be playing in groups at all.   
---
All the other comments were after he started blaming the priest for his mistake when we all could see that the priest was oom. And imo those were justified jabs
---
Hi Kirm!
---
I am surprised I haven't seen any of it.. was wondering if it was viable. Not that I am a rogue ... or even 60.. lol

Oh that’s right. Yea there’s so much gear out there

Epic mount money from selling twink items. There's some really good/expensive blue BoEs that drop there

so the entire issue with pvp doesnt even apply to you and you are actually getting mad at the behalf of other carebears "trapped" on pvp servers? yikes
---
What kind of nap mages are you battling? Hell even with engineering and FAP a decent mage should be able to kill any warrior with lvl 1 frostbolts

&gt;Because Blizzard has shown that it takes quite some effort from the community for them to listen.

And posting shit on Reddit is definitely going to get Blizzard to take notice.
---

Its going to suck when the BG queues appear. Alliance will have near instant queues and horde will be waiting around for HKs while they wait on their 15 to 20 min queues. Enjoy it while we can bros, cause its ending in Phase 3.
---
What would be ironic about me gearing up a twink?
---
I've just been using the +25 rod with +75 bobber. Haven't even looked into how pricey the +125 Engineering Bobbers are
---
Okay? I had fun during Phase 1 with open world PvP. I'm not having fun not being allowed to play the game. I've already rerolled on PvE, but it sure would be nice to not throw 240 hours into the bin.
---
I have stopped classic because the attitude now is not what classic was about.
---
I very rarely saw LFG X items locked... like really?
---
LF aoe classes, mages only....
---
and other sillyness.
---
Blizz: this is a normal server
---
You: it's not the intended way to play
---
xD
---
"Poison this guy's dog."
---
Uh
---
But you missing all the fun!
---
I would've cut him slack if he didn't start blaming the priest for no reason.  
---
Also my whispers after he left were abit heated because he literally wasted 70 minutes of my time. And I mean wasted.
---
Not anymore, at least.
---
Am I having a stroke or does this make no sense?
---
Yes it does. You can kite the black rock dwarves literally infinitely just with healing.
---
How come? I opened it and there is the same complaints like here: no actual character deletion, no actual unsub proofs, just complaining.
---
Dodge kick, keep flame shock up, searing totem. Healers are pretty hard for rogues to 1v1 if you're evenly geared.
---
That means you've won PvP and can not start doing PvE content
---
I feel like yall should listen to our last 2 episodes and smoke some weed.  as for the journey......buckle up buttercup, shits about to get real
---
Hi, I don't actually play, just watching the streams. Is fire mage the best class for WPVP honor farming after rogue? If not, which classes do you think will reach rank 14 faster and are there any classes that have any noticeable disadvantages?
---
funfact: it is still more honor than being in a raid.
---
I am a stick.

Nah just make an alt on the same server, invite a friend and make them leader, then log on your alt. Have your friend make your alt the party leader then leave. Now you can reset the instance whenver you want! (after a 1 minute wait between logs for party lead to switch over).

Your FACTION not your SERVER.

&gt;What are you talking about? No changes is a fucking joke, the server pop cap and 1.12 frankenpatch we have almost make it a different game with a classic wow coat of paint.

At this point I'm just trying to make you understand that you may have an addiction problem if you don't ever consider than 10 hours/day of gaming is really really really high.
---
But then again you can se enemy buffs without detect magic on the target frame. So why not on the nameplate?
---
You let me know if you need a shoulder to cry on alright?
---
I specifically mentioned based on accounts. Alts don't add to the overall population at times as you can't play all your characters at the same time unless you multibox.
---
I've been too busy to play much. Did a BRD run and got killed a few times but life's too busy to go counter-raid the horde in Searing Gorge.
---
Thats only true if you don't twink / have other things outside of wow to do.
---
Its not uncommon for us to do our 5 runs in 20 minutes and then log of for an hour or so and do something else
---
Been farming vaults in brd no problem :p
---
😂😂
---
Might be a stroke. Theres no one actually playing on retail (hyperbole), therefore PvP doesn't really mean anything.
---
i got really mad for a second until i read a bit more. yea, pvp is set up pretty shittily.
---
Might as well do it then, because it's not changing.
---
Can someone explain to me why this is a rule?  Seems like they just made the map poorly if jumping on an object is an exploit.
---
See a doctor, stat.

Wow, that's a mighty long post - it deserves a long reply. I can't say I'm very experienced with raid healing in classic yet, but being on Horde, I can say that Shamans are best kitted to deal with raid healing unless the raid is very spread out - which isn't a big problem in MC. With that in mind, it's better to have them focus on raid healing than assigning them to a tank. They can also be decent tank healers if going for full T1, but at least until then, they can be put to better use elsewhere. Deep Restos will have Mana Tide totem which grants 1290 mana to every player in the shaman's group, if you are having mana problems for some reason it might be worth swapping the shaman from the melee group to the healer group for the 12 seconds that MTT lasts, it can make a pretty big difference to cover the last 10-20 seconds for your potions to get back off cooldown. It's a bit of a mess to do the swap, though, but can be done if you're channeling a 2-3 second heal on a target and do it quickly. Don't do this if you have a resto shaman in the tank group and he has to keep up Fire resistance or Tremor totem, though, as that can have some rather unwanted side effects. For our runs, Shamans focus on raid healing so far. 
---
The priest with the highest +healing should be rolling Renews on the tank(s) and topping with Heal/Gheal/Flash using ranks to match the damage of the fight and Shields are great toss in as well. Priest can also spot heal the raid of use PoH to top up their own group as required, but Shamans should be able to cover most of the raid damage. In our raids, 1-2 priests focus on the MT, depending on incoming damage. On fights with multiple tanks, 1 priest per tank is usually OK, with some backup from druids. In general Priests also throw out Renews and/or Heal/Flash heal to do spot healing if they are bored or raid damage is high, but always focus on their target if they are assigned one. 
---
Druids seem to be able to cover both tanks and raid, leaning heavier on Healing Touch (various ranks) and Rejuv+Regrowth, while utilizing downranked Regrowth and spreading out Healing Touch for big hits or Rejuv if raid damage is more steady/constant. Innervate and combat rez are awesome tools. In our raids, Druids can either be assigned one tank or help out on a tank if needed while doing spot healing/HoTting the raid, or they can focus on raid healing. 
---
The take-home message here is that you should get an idea of what spec your healers play, learn about the different specs and their pros and cons, perhaps check out some logs of other guilds and see how they are doing and compare it to your own raids. There are many cogs in the machinery, and in order to optimize how they work together you first need to get an idea of how each cog looks and what it can do. As a coordinator it should not be your job to have to teach people how to play their classes, that's something they should know themselves or at least try to find out on their own - outside of resto shamans, I can't really give constructive feedback to other classes outside of looking at their healing spell usage and comparing it to successful and well performing players of that same class - but as coordinator you should take note of if someone is performing way worse than another player of the same class, with similar gear, and try to figure out why. So many things could factor in there. Your best bet is to ask other players of the same class, try to get some constructive pointers and have a discussion with the player. 
---
If you are not farming the content (as in not killing 10/10 bosses with no more than 1-2 wipes) and have healing/mana issues, make it a point to ensure that your healers are bringing a good supply of mana potions and dark/demonic runes as well as some Nightfin Soup. For progression raids you could use the [Egregious resto shaman consumable list](https://classicwow.live/guides/18/the-egregious-guide-to-resto-shaman#launch_pre_raid_bis_phase_1_) as an example - Flasks are superfluous and not necessary in this phase, at all, and they cost an arm and a leg. Better save Black lotuses/flasks for future content. Mageblood potions and Mana oils are not added in this phase yet, but below there is a list of misc consumables which are quite useful - Restorative potions and GFPPs in particular help out a lot. Unless something is very wrong with your raid overall, no reasonably geared healer in this phase should have a reason to be OOM before the end of a fight if he/she uses consumables as needed or on cooldown. The guide I linked gives some quite good info about resto shamans in general as well as tips on UI/downranking, which can be applied to other classes as well. Regardless of what unit frames people use (I use Grid2), they should be using HealComm and either Clique (or a similar addon) or mouseover macros. Happy to help out if I can, in any way.
---
Why would they want him to stop playing? They're killing him for honor points.
---
Having raid gear is far from making anyone elite. All PvE content is a complete joke. Rank 14 PvP or bust
---
Had the same thing on my hunter, even had her reset from &lt;10% hp to 20 - 30% HP a couple of times.
---
Why did you role a PVP server? The past few days have seriously been the most fun I've had on WoW in a long time, possibly ever. And I'm Alliance on a 55/45 split server.
---
Frankly, a 24 hours ban for all people who break that rule would be a pretty fair punishment. It's been a known problem since the days of Vanilla and it's always been admitted that you're not fucking allowed to get up on these roofs to kill people.
---
\#nochanges right guys... guys?
---
The point is that PvE realms are boring af. The whole point is the element of surprise and the fear factor of being able to get attack someone or be attacked at any time. If I want a fair fight on a pvp server, I'm probably going to just duel someone. A lot of people complaining are the ones who can't do the ganking yet.
---
What are you, 12?
---
The second rogue you mean?
---
The minute I would be out of combat I would be spamming restealth, so yeah, I don't know why he just kinda strafed to the side. You can even restealth with a dot on you, as long as you get off the next attack before the dot ticks. My BF in vanilla used to actually practice that in duels with a SWP tick, get out of combat, restealth and cheapshot. I mean, that takes a lot of timing and a level 40 rogue might not have that down pat.
---
Hit 60 and equipped my tier pieces, I look like shinobi with his collar popped. No more farming, just ganking and raiding.
---
I don't blame them because they have the number, but Horde are legit ruining the game right now by camping literally every single FP and boat with gank squads
---
Yes! I bought an SSD just so PoE could run decently for the next league.
---
How much should I tip someone to make Devilsaur gauntlets &amp; legging, my mats?
---
After getting to STV quests on 3 different private servers and being camped non stop to the point where I didn’t want to play . I rolled on PVE server so I can flag myself whenever I wanna risk my hide lol
---
why do people care about roofs so much, that shits fun
---
"GET DOWN FROM THERE, JIMMY! IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!"
---
I've been playing this https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05501310501 til P2, perfectly fine for both dungeon and raid as healer or tank (or offtank in raid). I don't have improved Motw but my guild doesn't ask for it so it's fine for me, but maybe not for you.
---
I have respec to https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01-500251130302214-05501310231 for pvp
---
At the end of the day, those same people are the ones bitching about being ganked 24/7 and asking for BGs which are just as fun on PVE servers, which I often feel the need to remind people are actually "Normal" servers, and have always been "Normal" servers.
---
They knew this shit would get old 15 years ago, that's why the game was built with a PVP flagging system and optional PVP for those who enjoy it.
---
a year and a half at best,we're 2 phases in. there's 6 planned total. it took alot of people 2 full months at best,if you think they are just going to reroll because "classic is planned for years" nope not going to happen,its one of the reasons why pvp servers got so dead. i mean yeah retail itself became a factor,but when your a ganking piece of trash who does nothing but corpse camp people all day, your going to help kill your own server,and probably eventually the game as a whole.
---
this is going to snowball pretty damn quick unless blizzard jump starts BGs,people will start leaving here pretty soon. and they may not come back
---
Yes that is correct, in raids for example a shadow priest will put up SW:P 4 times then max rank.
---
Wasn't talking about the dragons specifically, but yes, I agree, it's not worth skipping. I was just trying to share what people have told me who have pushed skip runs.
---
Well if you're alliance you must be on a unicorn server where you're able to group consistently in numbers matching the horde.
---
It's always cute whenever people claim we're "missing out" or this isn't "how the game is meant to be played".  
---
I do enjoy PvP when I WANT TO play it.   
---
I do not enjoy PvP when I log on to play for an hour, and get assfucked by some rabid chipmunk, who gets a raging boner whenever he sees somebody marked a different color than him.   
---
It really isn't that difficult to grasp, provided you've got a brain capacity greater than a patch of mold.  
---
I'm missing out on the content? Yeah, **that's the entire point**. I'm missing out on content I'm *not interested* *in,* so it's a win-win situation for me, and others like me.   
---
It's like you told me I'm missing out on not living in Iraq, cause all the cars blowing up and ruined buildings really make you feel alive, man, when every time you go out, you gotta worry if your head will still be attached to your body by the end of the day.  
---
I'm happy you're enjoying your World PvP. Honestly. You paid for this game with your own money, if you get your fun out of it, great, I hope it continues for months to come.   
---
But I was given a choice in how and where I want to experience WoW. And my choice is shit, just because certain part of the game doesn't appeal to me as much?  
---
Yours isn't a "better" or "how it's meant to be" way to play the game.   
---
It's just different.
---
you are not better than them tho my little crybaby.
---
Anything that makes you want to play wow less is a win. Wow is fun but it is a drain on life and potential. It’s like doing less meth, nobody can knock you for it.
---
Yep, a lot of times you wanna complete set bonuses for example
---
Yes, that is how it's supposed to work.
---
How would you abuse Spy exactly ? Just kill everyone that walks around ? Because this is already happening, and I dare say would be happening with or without Spy, you'd just need a hunt in your party.
---
The idea being "I have everything I can possibly get outside raiding". There's no missing pieces between their raid gear that they need, so they have significantly less to do in the PvE side of the game.
---
The only thing I tried optimizing is based off my old memory of Alliance = long ass BG queues, rerolled Horde = instant BG queues.  I have an alliance alt primarily because I love alliance leveling so much and would have preferred that.  The fact he is likely to have an instant queue for PvP is a great bonus.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who is upset about this keyring thing. I feel like it got looked over by blizzard and most of the player base but I was really looking forward to it!
---
I play practically an identical build, usually tank 5 mans and heal raids just fine. Your gear will play a big role in your viability, I have a full tank set and a healing set.
---
Lol
---
0/30/21 is a common tank heal hybrid so that looks good.  The restoration talents look good but I would move a couple points around in the feral tree.  
---
I would remove 1 point from Feral aggression and 2 from Thick Hide to add the 5th point to Feral Aggression and get 2/2 in Savage Fury. 
---
These changes result in going from 10% increased armor to 6% which isn't a huge deal as a druid can still hit mitigation cap in the later phases, especially with the procs from priest healing. The 1 point in feral aggression isn't very valuable as that is more of a dps talent than a tanking one. In return you get 20% additional damage on your abilities, which is 20% more threat and also good for pvp. On top of this you get another 3% increase to threat.
---
No I didn’t
---
Ah, thank you. I feel like that's kinda bad. It would be so much better if it ramped up, especially in pvp
---
No doubt no doubt.
---
U got me
---
I have a lvl 90 or whatever, but I'd need to install retail client to log in on it.
---
I will wait for BGs with the main grind. Can’t bother to run around 16hours looking for pray
---
Ban thok drop rate is a lot higher than SGC/HOJ so you will quickly run out of mages, or have to swap them out regularly if you can find one at all.
---
That's because people think the "threat" of them canceling is enough to demand change. Meanwhile the addicts just keep giving Blizz their money.
---
I dont understand. How is this an exploit?
---
hahahha actually true
---
Downvote but no response, mr wisdom?
---
In the earlier days of the High Warlord/Grand Marshal grinds a lot of players would be constantly world PVP'ing in between BGs so I don't know if that's necessarily true that BGs killed PVP. 
---
Though I will give that statement some credit, because on our server (Mal'Ganis) the horde to alliance ratio was way off, so Ally's would get back into a BG instantly, where Horde had ~45 minute waits, thus leading to a bunch of really well geared PVP players World PVPing against a bunch of not-so-PVP-minded players.
---
I think it's awesome they did it this way instead of just a whisper or a ban. Makes the GMs more a part of the community when they interact, plus things like this get posted and everyone sees instead of just 1 person finding out.
---
Doesn't Horde also have more flight paths and their towns tend to be more central in a zone? Even better, Horde has two cities connecting the two continents via a zeppelin that's guarded by elites on both sides.
---
People in this thread gatekeeping wow servers is a new level of sad. 
---
Congrats on being spawn camped and having world pvp lag and crash the game with zero fun. You really showed me 
---
 I’ll enjoy my PvE server thanks
---
Yes, let the hate flow.
---
You people are all the same. If you love the honor system, you act like a shithead.
---
No, it's just as always.
---
People wish for mass cancellation to validate their own point but the truth is that once you get out of their echo bubble you realizze that they are just a very loud minority
---
But does it mean frostbolt will refresh ? Good to know
---
Are PVErs the new vegans?
---
Right. Thought you were mage
---
About half of the gold comes from mining, the rest is from items and the potentially herbs if one of you can pick that up. It also helps to be an echanter so you can disenchant all blues below 2g. 
---
When you got the route down you can easyli cap the dungeon. Me and my guildmate can do about 5 runs in 50 minutes, and it is not uncommon to get an arcanite crystal around every hour or so.
---
Thank you translator!
---
They are attempting to force you to buy server transfers.
---
its fun when its atleast kind of fair.  Getting ganked here and there and improv skirmishes?  Thats alot of fun.  getting smoked by some guy thats 60 and a hundred of his closest friends for an hour while i corpse run into an instance?  not so fun.
---
wpvp isn't about pulling a fair fight, it's about farming as much honor as possible. 48+ are in a terrible spot in open world atm.
---
I think there is confusion around honor per kill and the rank points. There is a limited number of rank points that you can get per week which is a translation of your honor for the week converted based on the percentile you fall into of your faction on the server.
---
Well i'm referring to loot chasing at 60 in general... referring to how the game is designed to get u to keep playing to keep bis gear in every slot for pve for pvp yada yada... less content than there is while leveling but designed as a time sink so you don't quit the game.
---
He's a Donald poster. Don't bother.
---
Being able to shift into feral charge is super helpful, especially in pvp. Plus in general the extra rage is nice in pve for threat generation. Improved mark is also good, but if another Druid in your raid has it you’re gtg
---
"re roll to a pve server or quit" your going to get no sympathy from any pvpers man. that's going to be their response to you.
---
they do not care about your well being,they don't even care about the game at large,all they want is for you to die to them over and over and over again.
---
This is correct. I am an Honored Elemental LW with Thorium Brotherhood and the only currently purchasable pattern for me is the Molten Helm. Our guild tribal has the Core Hound Boots. All other patterns are coming available in Phase 3.
---
Just earned a new subscriber!
---
Keep up the good work.
---
I think there’s something between 1 and 2 which is where I’m at. Honestly much more upset about login queues than world PvP. There’s ways to PvP to even the odds a bit that nobody wants to admit or are too oblivious to recognize
---
Is that some kind of conspiracy theory?
---
Helping out low level players is honestly some of the most fun you can have playing wow. Instead of dealing with shitlords your own level moaning about every little thing and struggling your way through awful pugs to lose the shit you needed to a ninja looter, you get to go and feel like a god and make someone's day, which is a real rush. Give someone a shitty low level green at level 7 and they'll remember it for years.
---
He edited. Horde mage
---
Keep in mind in TBC you had resilience and the game was far less bursty than vanilla was especially at AQ40/Naxx gear levels. 2's in TBC was about longevity and druids were pretty much the king due to mobility and getting out of combat to drink back up.
---
Can absolutely hear his clicking from here. 
---
Also. I’m confused as to why this is getting so many upvotes. It’s a shitty click pic of a wipe in November.
---
Don't use holy light rank 2 , any spell below level 20 gets a penalty on their coefficent for +heal. if you are gonna down rank holy light use rank 4, however it'd be alot better just down rank flash of light to rank 1 and heal for like 500 for 35 mana.
---
If i give my laundry machine a girl's name, does that count then for extra rep?
---
The dwarves near BRD are also bugged. Normal mobs won't chase you very far, healing or not. For them you'd have to hit them with offensive abilities every 10 or so seconds to keep them interested.
---
There's very few mobs that have limited leash ranges and can't be kited beyond that, no it's not about that.
---
As a Rogue with Spy Classic installed (only installed it to avoid gankers, otherwise I do think it is cancer) - I'm honestly not having a great deal of issues.
---
I mean, they changed the guards in Everlook so people wouldn’t hide behind the bookcase to not be aggrod by the guards. I would say that’s also against the rules tbh.
---
Rerolled Horde on a PvE server and hit 23 and spent 10 hours over three days camping for Humar and got him early Sunday. Hit 31 last night.
---
Wait , don't they punish you instantly, even without Ranking Points at the moment ? Like a hidden penalty, like you are starting at -100 and you just can't see it right now?
---
Is it sad that I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, because some people do seem to think about a group of gamers that way?
---
I'm a lvl52 horde on Skeram and have spent the last few days hiding in Azshara grinding mobs because at all the places I have quests (UnGoro/WPL/Winterspring) I get picked off by multiple raid-geared 60s while on mobs.  I think horde has more players therefore it's more common for horde to do this to alliance, but it's not ONLY horde doing it.
---
Nah you’ll just grind wsg for 16 hours a day
---
This depends on your talents. If you specc into flurry, then WF is far superior, as the additional attacks can crit and thus proc flurry. Therefore, you have more overall uptime of flurry which directly translates to more dmg output.
---
RemindMe! 5 days
---
This thread from 2 months ago has people reporting between 55/45 and 60/40. People were already talking about transferring at this point. https://www.reddit.com/r/Skeram/comments/czpxlw/horde_filth_you_reap_what_you_sow/ez034t2/
---
[magespriestspaladinsshamanshuntersdruids video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0)
---
so... you want P3 battlegrounds, in the lower level bracket.
---
As much as I want this, blizzard most likely will not do this until they introduce Belfs and Dranei
---
Yeah, a GM gave me a verbal warning once for swearing after someone reported it. Fuck.
---
I usually ignore players who start telling why they should be in MY group to. 
---
Because you know I decide who I bring to MY dungeon group.
---
I wish so badly that I had stuck to my guns and rolled on Grobbulus at launch but my friends didn't want to risk ruining the RP element of the game for others. Now they see how much fun and organization happens on Grob, and how relatively even the pop is, and wish they had gone there. I can't wait for paid transfers to open because I want to move there ASAP.
---
you misspelled tirisfal
---
Cheese pizza is my favorite. I am so jealous!
---
BRD was the hard part, was kinda fed up with running the instance and the corpse walk didn't help at all. Running Strat and Scholo was mostly doable with 1 to 3 deaths.
---
More fun in some cases, too, though I farm honor solo which feels more rewarding than this zerg mentality thing.
---
In addition to what the other guys is saying ... tranquil air isn't compatible with windfury which is the horde's main advantage for melee.  Unless you totem twist but that is going to kill your mana which makes it unfeasible unless you are a dedicated enhance shammie doing subpar DPS.  Also our raid usually only has 4 shamans (might have 5 this week) so that's a max of 5/8 groups with totems.  4 paladins would be able to cover every major paladin blessing on the whole raid.
---
Grats man!
---
Inflight
---
I don't play a hunter in Classic. I played one back in the day and just assumed the talent would actually work.
---
I'm a dwarf.
---
Next three pools will be 2 hit globes of water
---
So with your theory, nobody died, so what's the problem? If the guy runs through the portal before killing his target due to guards why is this a problem?
---
I just rerolled on a PVE server, I made it to 53 on a pvp server but I have to admit to myself I'm just a filthy casual. It'll take me forever to hit 60 if I spend an hour of the two hours a day I play getting ganked.
---
That's why i said you are short sighted.
---
Please re-read your first comment.  Im just reacting to your definition of game breaking not your point of view about the addon
---
Hmmm?
---
A lot of your addon code deals with obfuscation and all of it is compiled so that it's not easily readable until you decompile it. Typically addons come with their code in plaintext so all of this leads me to believe that you're doing something that you don't want us to know about. Why? Why would you spend so much time writing something like this to hide your code? 
---
I did not dive any deeper than decompiling your code and having a quick glance over it, but I surely won't be installing this if there's no other reason than "I always just do this in all of my projects".
---
&gt; Warrior paladin is a great combo. Both melee and mail/plate means you are both really tanky and buff each others damage.
---
And both need same items from dungeons with +str/stam)  
---
Actually from items perspective hunt/pala is better, because one will gram agi items and another str.
---
For our guild it's Druid/Lock 24/7.
---
Not that I'm complaining being the only Resto Druid, but it can get disheartening for our fellow Mages/Priests/Wars &amp; Rogues.
---
Then you happen to be on like the 1 server where populations are reversed. Heartseeker I think it is? I feel for you because this has been the alliance experience on basically every single PvP server except yours since day 1. World PvP is fun for exactly 15 minutes in a zone when factions are close to a 1:1 ration in the fight and then quickly stop being fun as that ratio becomes 4:1 or worse and the flight master is killed and graveyard gets camped.
---
How 4 times the amount of Horde all trying to get rank 14 live with 1/4 the Alliance. It just won't sustain itself.
---
This didn't work when I took the druid FP from moonglade to TB. So just an edge case
---
&gt;You're pretending that the leveling and mount grind does not suck balls, which it does.
---
Maybe for you. I legitimately enjoyed my leveling experience, and I enjoy making money by playing the AH.
---
&gt;This must be factored into the equation before we start squawking "sunk cost fallacy".
---
It is. See above.
---
Use CHT in your OH.
---
Is there a general amount of honor that should get corporal? Like 5k or something?
---
It’s you’re not spending all your time. It’s only till 60.
---
Just speak with any First Aid trainer and actually read what he will tell you ...
---
First boss in AQ, iirc?
---
I think people defending this addon don't say that you can, they're just saying that even if you can't, it doesn't make any difference, because it's not like getting a detailed summary of the 20 enemies around you is going to change much.
---
I still haven't seen anybody propose a situation where Spy would make a clear difference and destroy a part of the game. Hiding behind trees ? 99% of people using Spy will not behave any differently when they get a detection of someone that they can't see. They'll just assume the dude is killing mobs, drinking or afking somewhere nearby and keep running in the same direction. I sure would, and I've seen a lot of world pvp over several expansions, both on private servers and retail. You can still ambush them if they can't see you, even if they have Spy. Try to ambush people by hiding behind trees and report back. I guarantee you the most effect Spy will have is that maybe 10% of dudes will stop when they come in range, look around for a bit which will be useless since you're hiding, and then just keep going.
---
And if it's a mob of gankers and you can't hide from them because of this ? Well you couldn't have hidden from them anyway, because if they're not completely stupid they'll have brought a hunter to track and mark enemies.
---
And the people saying that it breaks stealth because people know you're around in stealth and will run around to try and find you ? It's a simple learn to play issue. Stop moving around in stealth like you're invisible and actually learn where most people will assume you are and go elsewhere. Anyone who's played some amount of pvp as a rogue knows what I'm talking about.
---
It's all mind games. Spy changes the game, and you have to adapt to it. You want to ambush someone ? Work on the assumption that they have Spy, and target a nearby mob to make them believe you're not about to jump them. You want to get away from a gank mob ? You won't be able to, because they're a gank mob, and spy has nothing to do with it. You want to sneak around some people in stealth ? Just assume they know you're there and move out of the common areas that they're most likely to search.
---
Araxom’s gone now.
---
Why don't you just make your own groups?
---
fairly inexpensive definitely worth for the no misses
---
Feel like WPVP is the only thriving aspect of classic. Seems like most other parts of the game are just dwindling down, while WPVP continues to thrive.
---
If it's a server with insanely bad faction balance then that's fucking bullshit and I agree it's not a pvp/pve problem. It sucks Blizzard botched those servers so badly. I do feel for them.
---
I play on a 50/50 server so sometimes I need to remember that people are mostly whining about their giga scuffed server. Fair enough
---
Just checking, are you an old player who play classic because you played vanilla? If you are, are you really upset about the keyring?
---
There are people who unironically feel this way about what's going on right now.
---
So what you're saying is, stop playing the game for 6 weeks so I can enjoy playing the game? Can I not make it plain that Blizzard fucked up? Nochanges \^\^Except changes that saved us money and had an effect on every facet of the game for people who are paying us a million+ dollars a month
---
Current form of wpvp will definitely completely disappear, yes. You'll still have wpvp, the ok form, the one everyone is fine with. Not this shitshow.
---
10g tops.
---
Yep it's a tier, you see. This is what games are; they have winners and losers.
---
This is actually a pretty interesting topic if you're into speed running or "efficiency" running.
---
The topic hasn't been talked about much, but as you can see you're not going to get much from reddit.
---
Even on one of the speed runner discords, there won't be much interest in it until TBC is announced and it's a real tangible thing that people want to devote cycles to figuring out.
---
--------------
---
Having said that, I was the server 2nd 70 during actual TBC _and_ I did stockpile quests like you're talking about here.
---
I had 4 60s during vanilla, and the one I made for TBC was new, so I hadn't already played it through some of the quest hubs for leveling or rep grinding.
---
Here's what I remember:
---
Started in LHC - turn in quests.
---
Hearth to Silithus - turn in quests.
---
Used dimensional ripper - Everlook to port to winterspring and turn in quests.
---
Mage portal to SW (I had my mage on another account there waiting to port me), then fly to nethergard keep and go to outland.
---
One thing I'd consider is starting at chillwind point with those quests + a ton of scourgestone turn-ins assuming they give XP when the 60-70 bar opens up.
---
-------------
---
The main thing that was different back then was that there was no digital download for the game.
---
I bought two copies of TBC, one from blizzard delivered via mail, on the small chance it came in early and I had it ready to go.  Since that didn't happen I went to the midnight release at my local Best Buy.
---
Point being that, like original vanilla release, the first hour+ there wasn't a mass zerg of nerds ready to play like there would be now with digital download.
---
So I was able to turn in quests, and still get to outland ahead of the majority of players and could quest in peace.
---
Since the dark portal will be swarmed with people as soon as blizzard flips the switch for TBC, pre-questing is probably going to be a waste.
---
It will be much more important to get out ahead of the zerg at the start rather than spend time derping around in the vanilla world turning in quests, only to get stuck in the middle of the zerg once you go to outlands.
---
My entire guild rerolled from alliance to horde back in vanilla when a new server set launched because of how bad the alliance queues were.  We ended up getting instant queues as horde which was nice.
---
Much like server transfers in general, not really.  I'm sure some people would take it there would not be enough of an impact to make a difference.
---
The inherent problem is 60-65% of the pvp pop wants to be horde.  There is no way to balance it without simply hard capping the amount on a server.  If that happened, people would then bitch about not getting to play what they wanted and we just have an entirely different argument.
---
There isn't "good" solution.  You can argument another one is less bad, but that's also because you don't imagine yourself being the one punished in the other.
---
Pool of water in azshara? Literally had the same thing happen to me the other day but it was only 3 in a row before the pool got depleted.
---
Ranking points, not honor. RPs are based on your HKs in proportion to other players of your faction.
---
Faction locked transfers have already happened.
---
Or maybe you're just not on a server where literally every leveling zone and instance portal is being camped
---
At least through BWL. I'm not sure past that because I haven't checked.
---
If they don't want people on the roof they should be made inaccessible. This is just stupid and lazy.
---
True story.
---
&gt;you are wrong and dishonest, I'm not going to argue with you!
---
Okay.
---
Server restart will reset all spawn timers.
---
Dude your talking to a dude named kronic420blazeit lol dont expect much reason
---
I'm on Thunderfury, Horde me and my brother and a friend almost always exclusively play together. Soon as phase 2 hit we hit level 48 so I was kinda dreading it but we've actually been doing quite well. Didn't encounter many level 60's but we can pretty much 3v2 unless it's a paladin+warlock(?not sure about this specific combo I just know paladins are really annoying). 
---
We've had tons 3v3's or 3v4's vs our level or people slightly higher level than us and it's quite fair and sometimes challenging in situations like when we initiate on 4 orange levels
---
We tend to do pretty good due to our high utility/dps (Feral Tank Druid, Combat Rogue, 2H Arms warrior) haven't really been completely destroyed by any big groups or anything it's usually quite even. The most unfair fights we have are probably 3v1's we aren't gonna ignore any alliance but we don't camp them either. Overall I've actually been enjoying it a LOT.
---
The problem is people failed to understand classic isn't for them still tried to play it. They will feel much better playing retail or another game indeed.
---
Do note Blizzard was extremely sceptic towards the playerbase in the first place, so even if all of these people complaining will cancel (protip, they won't), the amount still playing will be quite enough.
---
Yeh pure tank is 11/31/5, so omen, lotp, furor.  Then you've got 4 points to put wherever u want, 2 for imp. enrange maybe but remember that nerfs your armour so you don't really want to be using it during a fight, its not that important
---
this sub full of fucking crybabies
---
well in a sense they also lost...
---
This level of tanking never happened in classic. I’m assuming you’re speaking out of your ass.
---
You aren’t
---
Thank you!
---
It is fine in duals. It’s a bit overshadowed because holy is absolutely a top tier spec for pvp
---
So put something that blocks LOS so they can't attack people from up there.
---
i had no idea about this, was rerolling on a PVP server when someone told me of this. So i tried to go to South Shore on my 60 druid, and holy fuck was there pvp.
---
Safe to say, im not rerolling any longer.
---
ironforge.pro has some good server stats about population.  You can assume ones with huge faction imbalances its just a slaughter fest for one side for the most part.
---
Exactly.  The game supposedly isn’t about 60 and it’s the experience, but god forbid if you have to do some leveling again.  
---
I rerolled at 35 bc I didn’t like my class.  It’s not that bad
---
There is a work around, but it is a global effort. If everyone interested in pvp on all their 9 alts score 15 HK and thus enter ranked players. This could increase NR tenfold, which would make all brackets 10x larger. Basically, low level alts would take the bottom 90% of the ranking list and thus push all the main characters on the server in the first few brackets.
---
The whole word. If you had half the word you'd be fine but now you know to stay away from inappropriate words and hopefully it will be your infraction.
---
Wrong.  If they did nothing we would still be at roughly 65-35.  Instead blizzard opened two waves of transfers that all the coward alliance used to leave for heartseeker.
---
\&gt;  as everyone is trying to maximize Honor 
---
No they're not. If they were, they wouldn't be killing lowbies, they wouldn't be killing you the second you land, and they wouldn't be corpse camping you for hours at a time. 
---
They're simply intentionally trying to ruin another player's experience. 95% of what I see going on is honorless kills or honor reduced kills.
---
Sorry I meant streamer youtuber pserver players like Skarm
---
Since most people complaining about being outnumbered in the world, they are literal minority indeed and it was well expected from the very beginning. People rolled Horde en masse.
---
You'll feel different when your balls drop.
---
This is what blacklists are for. I play and assume ppl are good until otherwise as opposed to assuming ppl are bad until otherwise. 
---
If someone is just wanting to quest and mind their own business I see no reason to be an additional griefer because god knows theres an endless supply of Those already.
---
If they kill me they have to deal with the fact that everytime i come across them for the rest of their existence on this server I am going to go out of my way to grief them as much as possible.
---
Yuuuup, that's exactly how PvP works in some other mmos. Runescape and EVE Online are two I've played that work like that.
---
If you think that's bad or unfair that's totally fine, I didn't say it was better even if I like it better. But WoW's PVP servers are the care-bear-PVP-mode of the mmo genre. WoW has good PVP, but PVPers in WoW who think they're tough when death has zero consequences are a fuckin' joke lmao
---
Halfway through our Mara run last night we decided to host an intervention with our mage about her drinking problem.
---
You have to be horde lol. Not that you’re wrong but you’re too chipper about it all
---
Ideally, I could find a server that organizes large-scale PvP battle events. Which is doable on PvE servers, but I'm not sure if there'd be interest or not among people who chose PvE. So, for now I just chose RP-PvP as the most likely candidate for all that. Though, I am interested in trying out PvE sometime.
---
Probably get it for less than 30g.
---
Pretty sure it is on the no one wants this but at least it vendors decently list for hunter solo tribute runs.
---
faction queues will force transfers.
---
I'm pretty sure most top raiding guilds on servers are actually Alliance. Kromcrush top 20 guilds when it comes to Raid content were like 16:4 Alliance:Horde when it came to clearing MC and Ony. That's why most of us are raid logging. If it isn't a raid night it isn't worth spending 2+ hours to go from IF to a BRM instance or Stratholm.
---
That explains it. Just take advice next time from real pvp servers. We went through it and know whats gonna happen. Don't listen to what a fake server with pay to win gear has happen.
---
I still expect some of them canceling their subscription indeed using p2 as a trigger point but I am yet to see any considerable amount of proof here or on the forums.
---
Good luck, hope you make friends quickly.
---
what? It's literally better to stack gear on one player for sure. The pieces all enhance each other..
---
Got sucked into Deatb Stranding. Currently building zip lines across hard to reach areas where roads arent possible.
---
I can't believe you could let something so trivial bother you enough to make this thread.
---
It was an example. I'm not using rank 2 at 60 lol
---
Uh, because it looks cool?
---
He's talking about the use of addons that help people pay attention to mechanics in raids. DBM and such.  His statement is that people can't/won't raid with out them.
---
Just please remember to respect the RP policy if you do. 
---
I’m not saying you have to RP,  just be mindful of those who do like to RP.
---
Arguing with someone on Reddit doesn't net you anything. This person obviously is stuck in their own echochamber.
---
You are lvl 42 and calling people a noob? Are you on Bennediction? Are you alliance? I sure hope so. I will show you what pvp is about.
---
Boo hoo
---
Engi helmet + sheep = kill one. I guess a keyboard turner action bar clicker like you didn't figure that's possible, huh?
---
Ok
---
Combo points they can’t use because I kite the shit out of them
---
The domination war for mats out in the open world was one of the key points of vanilla. If your faction is heavily outnumbered, this means you lost this war, accept and move on. Open world farming is extremely difficult = the prices for it goes up and up until the balance is established.
---
This means people brave enough to go outside and farm it will get much less herbs and ore per hour but will get much more gold per 1 herb or ore on AH so the actual gold per hour is the same. And of course, most of the endgame resources won't be even an issue thanks to the DM runs.
---
This actually happened to me for real.  =( 
---
I made sure my main and alt had used up all their rest XP before logging off just before leaving for a flight, where I was going to be gone for 10 days.  My main was lvl 55 and my Alt was lvl 36 (I only play alt when he has lots of rested XP).  
---
The very day I came back and could play the game, Bliz dropped Phase 2.  I was very demoralized.  World PvP went from a once in a while fight for resources and mob kills to being camped and killed over and over while trying to quest.
---
I don’t know if it’s good irony if it isn’t really correct... Yes, Theramore was controversial but most civilians were evacuated during the battle and the city itself had positioned itself as a military threat toward the Horde.
---
Two points I can make here:
---
1. As I said earlier, Spy completely removes the need for a hunter, giving their advantage to EVERY class (I think one can see how that feels unfair to hunters, when we don't have many other advantages?)
---
2. Take places that are very crowded, say IF at day time. In a world without spy, a rogue could gank in the canals VERY easily without getting found by anyone (I'm sure you've seen that in pvp videos back in the day). Track humanoids doesn't reveal horde there, as there's about 200 dots on your minimap. With spy though, good luck to any rogue ganking people there, he will immediately pop up on everyone's spy when he opens and the first thing people check are the canals, then the houses. Have counter-ganked multiple rogues with this so far, I'm sure many many people can agree with this easily
---
I agree. I wouldn't be surprised if they announce the release this week, and put it out in 1-2 weeks after the announcement.
---
Why did Legendaairy go offline?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/druid-class-quests-classic-wow
---
Looks like you have done them all? That’s doesn’t seem like many but wowhead is generally right.
---
Before you judge, try playing as alliance side on Skeram without spy when every enemy you face has it :)
---
Also rogue. Am lvl34. Also having a thrill every 10min. Am loving it.
---
how can you know whats in the chest before inviting people to your group? once you open it, wont it throw up all the loot. and even if someone joins the party afterwards, they cant get it
---
Well, just like there's a lot of crappy mages there's also a lot of warriors who never have FAP or ever put up a fight to a mage.
---
Got him! there's no coming back from that, he posted on the_donald so he automatically lost the ''argument''. /s
---
Typical liberal mentality.
---
It hasn't even been a week since the honor system launched and people think the hype around it will last forever.  
---
It's not ruining the game, it's causing a temporary inconvenience.
---
This. 
---
I'm a well geared fury warrior who is only missing HoJ from dungeon content,  I just advertise Arena/Anger/Golem runs with HoJ on reserve, low levels welcome.
---
I have plenty of lvl 52-58 guys joining and it goes very smooth since I'm tanking so I set the pace. You just have to kill 2 packs you would usually skip with a lvl 60 group. Its nothing.
---
I don't think people realize how much of grind r14 is. They're going to quit once they log on to their rank 1 or 2 today.
---
They have to farm that prehistoric
---
Exactly this, too many people don’t get the distinction
---
dx11 is the only option for classic.
---
If you're going to reach rank 14 you'll have to play in strong premades every day for several weeks, then play 12+ hours per day almost every for months. Fire mage is probably the best class for pvp along with sub rogues and arms warriors, as long as you have a group. Burst damage is the highest in the game but you need help to cc and mitigate incoming damage/cc.
---
Why are you even trying ? The official stance of this sub is "fuck PvP it's for losers", and no one will ever dare think otherwise here, the people who think like you are actuallly playing instead of crying.
---
There's no point in convincing these people. Let them roll PvE or quit and maybe we'll be able to enjoy phase 2 as it was always meant to be without children trying to ruin it
---
already works before, but you need to level 55 I think
---
Basic hygiene and responsibility deserves an achievement? As a millenial, fuck; the boomers were right 😭
---
I started and kindof gave up on Outer Worlds.  
---
Also put my game design studies in pause to  ...mature my warrior to whirwind weapon
---
I almost made it out of gagetzan once.
---
Yes, these types of games are called mmorpgs.
---
Same.
---
So what, youd rather stare at your screen waiting to rez for literally hours just to say to spite these people with pride? Fuck that. I'll go play death stranding and write up my college papers.
---
I'm not even mad, that's amazing.
---
This isn’t PvP on a vanilla server. We know for a fact the populations aware 3-5x larger packed in to the same amount of space. While this is technically PvP in the most watered down version, it’s like saying retail is technically an mmo. We know that statement is technically true but intellectually dishonest.
---
Quarry is the most problem I guess but still, once you're in, you're in. Later you will need only 1 corpse run per dungeon reset and you can bring a repair bot with you if you don't reach guzzer.
---
Outstanding move!
---
What’s with people equating balls to time? Of my friends that are playing classic, none of us are 60. We are on a PVP server. None of us are enjoying spending half our time corpse running because everyone on the Horde thinks they’re gonna get High Warlord in their PvP raid group killing lowbies .
---
The entire point of opening with CS on a mage is to get that blink out and apply 2-3 combo points and if you're kiting a rogue to death than congrats on killing an extremely low iq player.
---
I just looked up '[blizzards rules](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/08b946df-660a-40e4-a072-1fbde65173b1/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement)' on your behest, and I have a question regarding "1. The Platform. - C. License Limitations. - vi. Data Mining", did you get permission by Blizzard to gather that data?  
---
Also Point "1. The Platform - D. Platform and Game-specific Features - 4. User Created Content" Blizzard states that "You represent and warrant that the User Content does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other intellectual property and/or personality rights of any third party."  
---
Furthermore "11. Governing Law", I'll just quote the whole thing here:  
---
&gt;This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France. If you are resident in a member state of the European Union, you also enjoy the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your member state.    
---
So Blizzard quite clearly states that EU law applies.   
---
I am looking forward to your reply.
---
People have no clue. I grinded rank 9 was 2 days away from 10 before i burned out. Its such a hard grind. I was doing probably  30 hours a week of just bgs and winning a lot. If youre not in an organized group and youre not co ordinating with the other people on the server trying to hit 12 or over you will never even be able to touch those ranks. Honor farming hillsbrad is a joke compared to what youre really going to have to do. So go out and just find fun wpvp experiences for now.
---
This thread does lol, that's all it references
---
Unrelated but i also have sinister/backstab/evisc on 1,2,3
---
It took me an insanely long time to get Crimson Felt Hat, he's probably still working at it. Also, who flasks on Onyxia? MAYBE a cheap one but Onyxia is not a DPS race. GFPP might help P2 a little bit but pretty unnecessary.
---
Skeram is actually unplayable as alliance.  Just my luck that I randomly picked a server and it happened to turn into the most unbalanced in the game.  I want to reroll but really dont want to abandon a character I've put 3 months into with gear and gold.
---
yeah that's fair lol. But if you're on Faerlina then cry more and get good!!
---
Only bannable if you didn’t use existing game mechanics to get up there and you use it to avoid guard aggro per a gm ticket we submitted. Otherwise it be fine if no guards aggro to you
---
Neatplates
---
Engineers, I need your help.   
---
I leveled to 303 currently (gnome alliance mage). I wanted to complete the gnomish engineering path. I started the first quest in IF. I got a book. I looked on Wowpedia and got all of the mats for the 'show your work' quest.   
---
I am looking in my inv and the book is gone. I have nothing to do currently but I am not a gnomish engineer. It said I had completed the gnomish eng quest but I apparently am stuck. What am I doing wrong? I can't learn the gnomish eng schematics.   
---
I went online and can't figure out what I did wrong.
---
Most of the T1 Mage pieces are worse than pre-bis blues. Only like 2 pieces are worth getting.
---
What, but what if they actually fixed the GAME????     
---
OH NO 15 YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY FIX BUGS!!!!!!    
---
Blizzard are a bunch of scammers.
---
Biggest tip I can give you is that taunt is useless if you already have aggro on the enemy. Save your taunt for when the enemy gets aggroed away from you. 
---
Also if your not stance dancing (I play a full prot warrior), pop bloodlust before you run in and sunder the first target you mark with a skull, that way you usually sunder 2 targets right away on a pull and save your taunt for when you lose aggro. Try to save your rage when your fighting the last guy so you “pool” your rage for the next pull. If you do this, your healers and dps will love you as you can zoom through instances.
---
True.  But thus a GM.  Blue ridge is a GM color.  The fact alliance players could understand them is another give away.
---
The only time I got mad was when I lost my Dragonslayer (onyxia) buff when trying to get to MC. Guess what, it was my fault for not rolling with the guild.
---
Grob is great.  I rerolled from one of the most lopsided serves to the most balanced several weeks ago and couldn't be happier.
---
Why do alcoholics keep drinking even though they know it's bad for them?
---
Of course there is but you clear the dungeon in like 10 minutes.
---
Thats the point of the item. To bait cc and slows. When all else fails you still get some spell pushback.
---
&amp; heavily needed on scumbag Skeram
---
Hunter solo'ing trib runs is pretty decent gold.
---
Between vendoring stuff, selling ring/staff/chest and AH'ing the potions and food/drink you get, it is quite easy to average 60-70g/hr, irrespective of your gear.
---
I have ~65 King kills to date and have earned about 2700 gold, so doing the math, thats ~42g per run on average.  Now I did get lucky and got a Foror's Compendium drop which sold for 500g, but even without that, its still 34g per run.  2-3 runs per hour.
---
It really isnt gear dependent either; it just affects how quick your runs are.  It can actually be done sub 15mins naked.
---
Narcissist says what?
---
I just hope the pet wont pull half the instance :D still need to go test it out in high lvl dungeon
---
Played since launch of vanilla. Want my keyring. Stop gatekeeping classic
---
It's not good in BGs so up to you. It will go up in price due to it being extremely rare and a neat item, but that's way down the line when people have gold to blow on something like that (after enchants, consumables, pets, twinks, and bank standing transmog).
---
So you're right on pace.
---
Everyone and their mother was saying to get to 60 before Phase 2 started because it would make leveling incredibly difficult. You knew what you were signing up for.
---
The MCP is a 50% attack speed bonus. It even says so on the weapon itself.
---
Same, I'm either going to reroll or just sit out until paid transfers are a thing
---
For pvp the Blade is a must-have.
---
Bullshit. Your comment history shows you're on Deviate Delight which is [54/46 in favor of horde](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4386_Deviate%20Delight)
---
You guys put up a respectable fight though. Had some good battles at the Bulwark lately
---
If you are quitting over this, you were always going to find a reason to quit classic.
---
YiKeS
---
Wow, so many insults from throwing a joke. Screw off back to school, kiddo. 4 loads of laundry per day is abnormal.
---
That's pretty neat not going to lie
---
Yea I am completely happy with my choice to roll PVE.
---
Largely because I am solo player, wanted to play a healer, and can only level a 2 or 3 days a week. The idea of logging in on one of the few days that I can play and getting ganked / camped constantly sounds pretty bad. I was on PVP in vanilla and had a great time. But I was also playing like a fiend and had a group of RL friends to play with. 
---
That and outside of a few classes, classic PVP just isn't that interesting to me. So many useless specs and classes that are just straight up bad in so many situations. IMO, PVP really started to come into it's own in BC when you actually play stuff like a healing priest in PVP without just getting completely dumpstered by pretty much every other class in the game.
---
With Onyxia's RNG I'd probably argue her as the most difficult boss so far in Classic. MC you can faceroll everything (even ignoring a lot of mechanics) in under a minute for most bosses.
---
yeah but if you found the character your like and are halfway through your adventure it does blow to sacrifice the second half of your adventure, invalidating ALL story and progress you made with your character to start all over again.   
---
Its shitty if you have limited time. I also rerolled around 25/26 to a shaman but if I had to do it now a level 43 I would never see the second half of my journey. Not about reaching lvl 60 its about seeing the rest of my journey through.
---
I enjoy killing stuff with my guild I haven’t gotten any epics for a few weeks no big deal still fun to down bosses for the first time.
---
Think we might both be misunderstanding each other.  To try and keep it simple:  I am not saying you leave the server at all but merely are able to change to the other faction on the same server (has a ton of issues like shaman -&gt; paladin gearing etc and vice versa).  This combined with faction based queue will opt for at least some people to decide that being on the same server but without a queue is preferable to sitting in queue.  Keep in mind the benefit is doubled because for every horde that goes alliance the overall balance improves by 2 (+1 ally -1 horde). 
---
And yes there are problems like if people are really well connected with non-guild friends, gear being non-compatible, alts, and a ton of other things probably.  However there are probably enough solo players/small circles/etc that could easily swap if it meant they didn't have to sit in a queue vs a 1hr queue instead.  Without a faction based queue though it would indeed be pointless because almost nobody on Horde would want to jump on to Alliance or they would have already gone to Heartseeker.
---
Nice! That’s insanely lucky. I think you will upgrade it around P5 from raid drops.
---
You ok bro?
---
There aren't cast bars in Classic either, we are using addons, exactly how it was done in vanilla.
---
So would you invest time on leveling a hunter or invest the same time just earning gold with my paladin in not that efficient ways
---
The mace has a pretty solid drop chance in tribute, I wouldn't read into internet drop rates that much.   Lots of hunters selling DMT chests relatively cheap.
---
Autocorrect.
---
Honestly as long as your getting tank gear you can tank without the spec. I am full specced DW fury and OT some MC fights fine. Can MT UBRS LBRS SCholo ETC. it’ll certainly be more difficult but it’s doable
---
Neat ... can you point me toward anything that's displaying the data?
---
I had that issue last night. I reset my router and it helped me get in.
---
Damage breaks stealth afaik
---
Moonglade FP to Thunderbluff has no other stops, so no it's not an 'edge case'
---
This is why I chose PVE servers. We have options. Do I want to level or farm without being disturbed? Sure! Do I want to PVP? Sure!
---
The PVP servers elitists were bullying us into saying we were not getting the full vanilla experience, but to be honest I feel its actually the opposite now.
---
I’m a lock. Ty for the advice muahahahaha
---
Not if they camp the entrance to WSG like they do the entrance to BRD and MC
---
&gt;If you're outnumbered, just move somewhere else.
---
dang how have i not thought of that ill have to try this one thanks fella
---
All they have to do to solve faction imbalance is create a faction queue and limit the amount of players can be on the server for each faction.
---
You missed the point of the post entirely. 
---
Hes saying that people purely blaming horde or alliance are spewing shit. My server is 70/30 alliance to horde. I play horde. 
---
I'm not blaming alliance players for the reason it's a shitshow. It's the population of the servers and the imbalance, not the factions.
---
If it were the other way around the alliance would be having the same experience as I am now. 
---
It goes both ways.
---
The people who made classic didn't develop an entire game either, is my point.
---
Most of my guild will run squads through EPL/WPL.
---
Watching everyone whine on this subreddit just makes one thing clear. The average player is terrible and wants everything handed to them and then can’t understand how they got retail.
---
I bet you beat the brakes off your spouse when they disagree with you.
---
Unquestionably suboptimal, but it is by far the most convenient build. With fury/prot you can tank way better than a fury can, and dps way better than a tank can.
---
If league of legends and path of exile can be free... why can't this game?  Maybe then they could also change the crappy gameplay design which revolves around their monthly pay model.
---
Same with EVE Online. You lose your ship, all the mods equipped to it, and sometimes that loss has a IRL-equivalent of over $1k if you have the most expensive ship and the most expensive stuff equipped to it.
---
I play this terrible mobile mmo Lords Mobile that's pretty brutal too. Building up a good composition of like 23 million troops can take someone months and months to do, and lots of people easily spend hundreds of real world dollars building up their troops. Whether you paid to do it quick or you're f2p and it took you forever, you can permanently lose all that work if any other guild catches you at a bad time.
---
I love PVP with high consequences in my games, and even though WoW's has zero consequences it's still good PVP. But when your MMO's PVP has less consequences than a mobile game you need to sit tf back down before you go shaming PVE players lmao.
---
People weren't inviting sub 60 unknowns to strat/scholo back in Vanilla either. If you're so hell bent on doing these dungeons prior to lvl 60 then feel free to make your own group.
---
raddd switching over for sure
---
Keep dreaming you could beat rogues. No way.
---
Cause there's like 8 mages in every raid, lol.
---
It's a chest, not a corpse.
---
&gt; There's still plenty of time to catch-up. 
---
Dont ever worry about this bullet point. There is nothing to catch up to. If your not in a guild it doesn't matter as people will always be leveling alts. People rushing to 60 are just going to be sitting around bored or...making alts. No rush man, no rush. If you are in a guild, there is still no rush.
---
I mean Druids were given a lot of love in TBC. Treeform, like 2 or 3 new HoT's, better talents to insta heal with HoT's (swiftmend). A level 70 Druid looked nothing like what current level 60 Druids looks like, it's like they re-did the class with nothing but HoT's and mobility in mind.
---
I've played PvP servers and open PvP games since Lineage 2 days (2003). None of these justify the obnoxiousness, especially for me as a working parent of two kids, one of whom is also playing WoW... he's around level 30 and watches the PvP action in Hillsbrad with fascination, but he's safe from being ganked over and over again because we're on a PvE server.
---
So you think they are overpopulating your low pop server?
---
Honestly, meeting people with your attitude in the game is so rare, but it makes the game worth playing.
---
Also, it makes the dungeon grinding a lot more fun!
---
&gt; TBC which even every streamer i've watched so far thought of as the best expansion 
---
You had me until.....
---
It's already calmed down. And you know it, you just love to whine, I'm sure you'll find another subject.
---
Warriors dps and hunters have some same items so it shouldn't be that hard.
---
Get the devilsaure set, true shot shoulders and you're basically good to go.
---
Obviously not what I meant. But keep on pretending/being daft.
---
Beastmaster is P5 :S
---
Warlock or mage are good choices, mage for AoE farming or warlock for mara/DM E jump run solo
---
Another option is to level characters to 35 and get alchemy / tailoring and sell xmute/moon cloth cds
---
Hahah so true. As an arms warrior, I tank my own dungeons, and never invite dps warriors. They can tank their own shit or leech off another tank.
---
Literally any other class brings more utility and is less annoying in terms of threat.
---
+50% attack speed doesn't mean a 50% dps increase
---
Only while leveling though. At later levels the gear is totally different especially if the play is holy.
---
No reason not to trust it. Since blizzard now requires human interaction to run /who they just changed it to trigger calls to /who in the background every time you click. I don't know about you, but I click a lot in this game and I bet a lot of other people do too.
---
You realize that Horde are overwhelmingly more popular on PVP servers, and that some of the biggest servers like Skeram (my home) are so incredibly imbalanced towards Horde as to make Alliance life nigh unplayable?
---
Listen, I’m not saying you are a moron who doesn’t know the least bit about what they’re talking about, I’m just saying your post makes it look that way.
---
QQ = cry more
---
Plus you can just toggle on PvP and head to southshore and get the world pvp you crave.
---
sounds pretty boring
---
Typical horde. Numbers isn't enough of an advantage, have to exploit too.
---
Join us in Bloodsail Buccaneers
---
&gt;We did it in vanilla *without cast bars*
---
What part of that did you not fucking understand? That's exactly what I said. There were no nameplate castbars in vanilla and it was done with wonky hack weakaura-style addons that did not have precision timers. They were much worse than the addons that pseudo-enable it now.
---
And Blizzard *did* add nameplate castbars to the engine at the end of vanilla in the TBC pre-patch.
---
your rank is updated weekly, so you need to wait a bit more for it.  
---
onor should be daily but its a bit bugged.
---
That doesn't mean 50% dps though lol. 
---
not sure if his numbers are correct but idc either.
---
Class balance in vanilla is trash.
---
Lol me it s the opposite. I just wanted to be on a Pvp server as alliance, and my friend kinda forced me to be on a PvE server ..... Cannot wait for WSG to be release
---
Having 12k people with no dynamic respawns and a 1-2 second delay on everything was not """""a better experience"""""" in the slightest.
---
So you’re not one of the people complaining; I’m glad we agree
---
Same story here. Except around 40 my buddy went fury (not sure why) and I switched to shadow around 46 because I was finding easier time to find a group as dps than as a healer
---
Pokemons?!?
---
Those are both not MMORPGS, so I didnt really care about the examples sorry.
---
Just keep in mind that the whiney ones are usually the loudest because everyone else who isn't upset is just... playing. For every post on here about how p2 made leveling on a pvp server hard, there are thousands and thousands of players who are somewhere between "dont care" and "enjoying it".
---
This is the same problem that WoW had in Vanilla, and one of the big reasons why BC was rushed to release instead of playing out the final phase of vanilla content.
---
Horde has the numbers, but it seems like the Alliance are more determined. Even as a Horde member, I struggle to go anywhere alone, anywhere around BRM is alliance dominated during most of the day, Kargath is constantly under attack, and the alliance held the zep to Orgrimmar in UC for hours the past two days.
---
Alliance definitely have the short end of the stick, but they wave that stick confidently
---
On my server (Grobbulus-NA) the highest rank achieved seems to be Master Sergeant (Rank 4) which seemed to require about 50k honor or higher. The highest standing person I managed to find was #3 with about 136K honor which put them about halfway through Rank 4.
---
Core hound tooth from majordomo. 1.60 speed dagger with some nice stats for threat.
---
and? what do you wanna say here? i guess you dont understand how mcp works
---
Um. Mangos is on github? I'm sure they put extra work into it, but we've had 10+ years of p-servers existing.
---
If you count the corpse runs, I’d say I ran the full length of the plaguelands a dozen times. Gotta get them steps in.
---
Pretty good, I'm almost exalted with the Furries on Retail. By today I should hit exalted. Then i'll finish Pathfinder 3 for flying in BFA. Might as well wait another few weeks before Classic population levels out again on PVP servers.
---
Who convinced me to roll on Faerlina again?
---
I disagree because I played Nos for ages without any issues. So ofcl course classic was my wet dream 
---
But When a game is literally unplayable yes I'm going to quit. I love it but it's literally impossible to play rn on my server...
---
Right now you can but only if you already have the recipe in your bag. 
---
Im working on the functionality of adding stuff to the list via ID, that way the API can fetch the item without it having to be cached in your session.
---
In vanilla I know a shadow priest was the 1st rank 14 on two of the realms I played on (both pvp, so one horde one ally). But that was only 2 realms out of [many] so anecdotal evidence only
---
Beaststalker*
---
Regarding the guards, I must admit that I had a different memory from their behavior, but hey it was 15 years ago so I might be wrong:
---
I thought they were much more aggressive, that they were much more spawn and that they could pop out of nowhere, especially in cities like booty bay. I remember them swimming too, which they don’t seem to do in classic.
---
Finally, they were still aggressive towards you for a few minutes if you managed to escape, and you had to wait a bit.
---
Is my memory flawed or does someone remembers the same behavior?
---
Ok then good for you I guess  but that means that if you couldn't play while at work (as most people) then you would be playing less than 15 hours/week  and saying things like "playing 20hours/week is super casual"  is totally disingenuous.
---
NO JESUS CHRIST.
---
People are griefing because IT IS FUN. If you carebears dont like it leave the fucking game or server but for the love of god just shut up.  We love kill guys like you if you dont want to fight us, just leave please or shut up. God I'm tired of this much complaining...
---
Fun Fact: Horde run around in raids, so if you are getting ganked that's why.
---
I don't think you'll make that much gold doing this personally. 
---
I used to do it on nd but I had full t2 and was able to /sit to proc reckoning and elemental earth sold for 5g there. 
---
Your best bet is to get herbalism for lasher farm or to find a warrior/rogue to do jump runs with.
---
Exactly what I don't have, don't believe in the necessity of the few extra AP from devilsaur and am using wyrm shoulders
---
Menethil Harbor is very good.
---
Not even close to true, if you lose a 1v1 to a warrior at 60 you are trash.
---
I guess people think PvP never happens on PvE servers..? You can still flag yourself, and you can still do BGs when they come out.
---
blue ridge?
---
Well if i had you until the last 5% that's fine by me.
---
I find the most obscure place in each zone to do this. Feralas is pretty fun right now
---
Bullshit, meta/bis/etc is absolutely the problem. People wouldn't have the time or gear or epic mounts to be as effective as they are right now at pvp because they would still be working on hitting 60, trying to get the first few bosses of MC down, learning where they can farm herbs and mines to make money, etc. Way more people have hit 60 and gotten geared out earlier than they did when vanilla Phase 2 came out because everything is documented and the knowledge and culture is there. The only other major reason is that the server capacity is way larger than it was back in vanilla.
---
Yup this is how it is man, have 8 pieces out of MC, a huge chunk of wow gold, and almost 30 days played on my main. But I've decided to quit the game overall. The remaining guilds are really shitty and most are just there to get a cut from the horde at the end of the day. All the top guilds seem to work with the horde extensively. Which just makes for an unfun corrupt playing experience.
---
It truly sucks, this is a game I've put more effort into then most and to see it just completely shit on me, has been all but fun. I really hope blizzard can fix this game, but for not I will put this game on rest. I cancelled my sub a couple days before P2, as I knew shit wasn't going to be fun. I didn't even give it a chance, not even logging in once.
---
This game turned into retail for me. Just a weekly log in for raid time and then that was it, unless i wanted to farm more wow gold....
---
This is entirely true. Low level pvp is so fun honestly and you have a *super* short time window to experience it, the pvp in that first few weeks is so good because you arent afraid of a 60 coming, ever. Which is vastly different compared to now when a 60 might already be in the area.
---
And being a clicker is guaranteed to fuck up even *that*.
---
Ooor, just dont exploit? It's no surprise to anyone that it's not allowed
---
The addons we had to emulate cast bars in vanilla were sticks-and-stones compared to what we have now, because it was rudimentary and half the talent/situational timers were inaccurate. 
---
And Blizzard *did* add native nameplate castbars at the end of vanilla with the TBC pre-patch. That is when all of those primitive addons died because they were not needed.
---
Where can you find out the ratios?
---
I've been seeing a lot of bad rogues with their t2 helms the last couple days.
---
Get a druid to play your pet!
---
A warrior would make finding dungeon groups easy, and it actually isn't as difficult as it seems.  The hardest part of tanking is dealing with dps who dont understand threat or who expect to run dungeons like it's BFA.  I always tried to make my first run through any dungeon be as dps to get to know the place and be able to tank it well later on.  It is really fulfilling when you get it just right.
---
Or run a druid.  All the fun of a rogue with the option to tank if you'd like.
---
It's the 2000 IQ play. It cuts time off of the inevitable corpse run by dying and releasing faster than you would have with full gear on.
---
How is this a shit post you clown. 
---
The game was not designed for 10k+ people to zerg lowlevels until the end of time. It was not even designed for 5k people.
---
Nothing cool about wiping on ony dog
---
Yeah, avoid prime time if you can, and hit dungeons during prime time
---
I guess you guys who box just want all the loot and less competition. It's very sweaty
---
And here I am rerolling from pve to pvp because this server is so casual.
---
&gt; As a side note, Vanilla itemization seemed like some darling aspect of the game. We remember it as not perfect but quaint in some way...But it was just nostalgia clouding judgement. Min/max stuff aside. That chest piece and trinket are just absurdly better then anything else till like AQ.
---
you explicitly state that you think the chest is absurdly overtuned and an example of vanilla's poor itemization so... no thats not all you were saying
---
&gt; I just looked up 'blizzards rules' on your behest, and I have a question regarding "1. The Platform. - C. License Limitations. - vi. Data Mining", did you get permission by Blizzard to gather that data?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also Point "1. The Platform - D. Platform and Game-specific Features - 4. User Created Content" Blizzard states that "You represent and warrant that the User Content does not infringe upon the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other intellectual property and/or personality rights of any third party."
---
&gt; Furthermore "11. Governing Law", I'll just quote the whole thing here:
---
&gt;     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France. If you are resident in a member state of the European Union, you also enjoy the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your member state.
---
&gt; So Blizzard quite clearly states that EU law applies.
---
&gt; I am looking forward to your reply.
---
A copy of the reply to your colleague.  
---
Thank you for taking time to reply in a more professional manner than your colleague. I will just reply to your points in order:  
---
Installing your addon will not work for me. I request you to not store any data concerning my person, in this case any data about my wow account and characters.     
---
The data is collected by Blizzard, this is fine by me and I do not intend to have it deleted. My concern is with you collecting my data.   
---
As you correctly state, my contract is with Blizzard. Have you been sublicensed by Blizzard to offer your service? Also, please see "11. Governing Law" where Blizzard states that the law applies. As an aside, the law would apply even if Blizzard would say otherwise.  
---
I appreciate the joke about being a citizen of Azeroth, but I ask you to respect my authority of my data regardless.
---
It's not about whinning, I don't feel it's healthy for the game in the long run.
---
Can confirm this feeling. We can still pvp on our realm, we just do it on our own terms.
---
Omar?
---
what server are you on? I haven't had a chance to play in P2 due to RL reasons but I'm not looking forward to logging on to my 40 Gnome Mage on Gandling.
---
Go read this forum and sort by new.  Tell me exactly how much it has calmed down?
---
Except it updated on one character and not the other. That is my point.
---
If you don’t want to ignore there’s an addon called character notes which let’s you keep notes on people
---
Having a feral is great because u can catform 90% of the bosses and be the 3rd/4th tank when needed. As others already said the mcp mace is required to pull top dps (which sux), but if you do you can even top the charts at patchwork in naxx (theres some great yt videos showcasing this).
---
Yea I should have included a /s lol
---
Haha, no way :D well maybe when all rogues are equipped to the teeth in my raid! But nice tip!
---
Bullshit. Why playing on a pvp Server, if you dont like to pvp in the open World? You cant leveling? Go in an instance! You only like instanced pvp? Play on a pve Server.
---
I think this whole sub reddit turns into a stupid crybaby forum for retailers, who pretend to be a old school vanilla wow Player, because the think its kind of cool and retro idk.
---
Whining about addons? As the crybabies, backpaddlers, clickers noskillers, pet pulling huntards as 14 years before.
---
Whining about pvp on a pvp Server? Yeah! You are alliance, they also were whining back than, good Job, i feel classic again!
---
All you want is in retail! Go back there. I hope p2 is longer than p1. The longer p2 the better the player base will be.
---
&gt; LCs are meant to prevent this.
---
Sure, tell that to my previous guild after I got scammed like almost all officeres jumped ship and left us on the dirt.      
---
I will never forget that shit.
---
Come join Westfall! 
---
It’s heavily skewed towards Alliance. But that just means instant queues for Horde in P3.
---
Devilsaure is useful for hitcap, especially with a warrior dps since you're not going to change these pieces that quick in MC. 
---
But if you manage to get 9% hit without it, go ahead!
---
It is vague, but asking a player to stop doesn't instantly constitute griefing.
---
There are actually tons of things that people can do to grief, however none of them are directly actionable. The only time one of these actions becomes actionable is when it is long-term targetted harassment (usually requiring multiple days).
---
For example, using linen bandages on warriors in combat, using rank 1 PW:S on priests, fearing mobs out of a mages aoe, using warlock infernal's to kill same faction, breaking cc, killing rarespawns hunters are taming, using BoP on people opening chests, etc. All of these actions are not directly actionable, only when it becomes an extremely long term issue does blizzard even begin stepping in.
---
Oh shit! I saw that too and wasn’t sure if it was better. I think I’m gonna change my wish list item to that then
---
This is actually against WoW Addon ToS:
---
**2) Add-on code must be completely visible.**  
---
The programming code of an add-on must in no way be hidden or obfuscated, and must be freely accessible to and viewable by the general public.
---
See [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1021053914](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1021053914)
---
I know it's only base64, but stull, this is an issue. [https://www.reddit.com/u/Rafikihkt/](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rafikihkt/) I suggest you remedy this before it reaches Blizzard's attention.
---
Surprised its only 10-15% boost max.  Is feral autoattack damage really that low of a % of their total DPS?  Even then shaving 10-15% dmg off 600 would drop you down to almost 500 which is obviously significantly less.
---
Just stand next to the portal spawn and camp there...
---
As much as you love the word, it’s not “literally “ unplayable. You just don’t know how to play around the world pvp hype. Stop blowing things out of proportion.
---
Oh the hate. Please please me daddy.
---
Not terribly different from the week prior. Aside from a few faction on faction  incidents this past weekend.
---
Yeah, I just read up on it.  Still seems better to grind water eles.   But I never quite finished leveling fishing so that sounds like a good way to do it.
---
That's actually wrong. If you have any buffs in you, self applied or otherwise, the add-on picks you up as soon as you get into combat log range. You don't have to cast anything, you could just be riding around on your mount.
---
I did alterac, then badlands. Though in phase 2 the latter is a bloodbath, while alterac is still relatively quiet.
---
How can you assert that it’s so black and white when it obviously isn’t? Why purposefully lie?
---
The exaggeration is outta control tho, damn. "I literally haven't been able to move my character more than max range from my corpse since Phase 2 launch!"
---
It’s frustrating seeing mages get away with it though after playing one seriously in tbc and wotlk. If i ever blinked it, immediate shadowstep kidney. In classic you can just blink it and immediately start casting poly and force them to either vanish that early or die pretty much
---
Use your felhunter to dispell cc on warrior
---
I think you're heavily underrating the level TEOM is at. He's more like Ret Paladin in T6 with Might of Menethil.
---
good, that is war. I'm glad to be on a pvp server, theres a creeper, emergent threat all the time you don't have much control over
---
It really depends on the context, if you can guarantee a crit with the ambush it can better to go that route, but a cs into a gouge usually does well against a bubbled mage since after the blink they'll still be gouged and you're able to close the gap and have some decent combo points.
---
What PvE server is it?
---
Take my downvote!  Sorry you're having a rough time, but it's all good on Incendius. Completely playable.
---
I am playing ally with my wife on Earthshaker we are lvl 34 in Arathi and SShore. So far we have been ganked once by a full 5 man grp, had to spirit rez and call it a day. But we had our fair share of killing horde as well mostly 2v1 and couple of 2v2. We never start a fight but there are dumbass rogues that want to catch us mid battle off guard with half health and still he gets killed, I mean wtf we are warr druid combo the hell with his +5 lvls.
---
But I think we are still low lvl to experience the whole situation I read about on this thread, plus Earthshaker doesn't have high population.
---
P.S. I played vanilla back in the day but this is not the genuine original open world PvP experience.
---
Yeah but fury tanks often don't use shields which is a very noticeable difference
---
Ok? and?
---
Man that’s almost 100G right there.
---
That's *never* been a rule. In fact on retail there were paid transfer options available from PVP to PVE only.
---
I made 2.5k honor, got from 58 to 60, did LBRS Quest Run, multiple Scholo Runs ( got cadaverous chest and legs), did strath living (got shoulders), did some felwood timbermaw farming (about 1.5k rep, about 25 honor kills, died twice), made about 300 gold, 250 to go for epic mount. 
---
I am a rogue with stealth privilege though. I feel like a god amongst men, i can enter BRD without dying or with not more than 2 deaths.
---
Alright alright, since my friend rerolled a hunter I can wait for him to start farming dungeons and just take this set, considering exams are close I won't have time to do it till end of january so I will do it now with lame set and then much later with a proper Beaststalker
---
That's why warriors have rage as their resource.
---
Westfall, Horde side.
---
If you want to earn money, Skinning + Mining. I took Skinning/Herbalism to gear myself when I couldn't get decent drops. Mining + Engineering is fun and useful in combat, but expensive.
---
lol similar story. background: i have a 60 hunter who I've been pvping on.  I'm also leveling an alt with a good friend who doesnt have a 60 yet his main is with me taking it very slow (about 1-2 lvls a week with him currently lvl 30).  We've pvp'ed together since vanilla so he's feeling a bit left out of the p2 stuff.  I keep telling him how crazy it is, bloodbath everywhere, "lets go to hillsbrad/stv for your first pvp of classic so you can see this" etc etc.
---
so we're questing in wetlands maybe lvl 28 or so doing an elite quest having a hard time about to wipe then a fuckign 60 tauren druid comes out of nowhere and helps us kill all the elite mobs after we tag them.  literally the first horde he's seen of classic and all of my blabber about cutthroat wpvp and this horde saves us from dieing  lol just about lost it
---
It's real value is that there are very few other rings for low level players to equip,  but it's not necessarily a "twink" item,  so I'd say it's value will remain consistent whether bg's are out or not.
---
Every guide is just assuming and everybody is losing their minds. The wow head guide is written by a private player...
---
Man I really hope this is you trolling and it’s actually a shit post. Because otherwise, yikes.
---
We open roll and bring 8-10 rogues and I'm 4/8 nightslayer, aged core leather gloves, and gutgore + a binding. I think we're on raid 8 or 9 by now most people are in a fair bit of tier gear
---
Agreed, same goes for crime in real life. Don't make rules that say I can't take your shit. Just go through the effort of making it impossible for me to do so.
---
Also +4 on OH is pointless since all rogue abilities scale with your MH damage. Put crusader or fiery on OH.
---
Yes. https://www.onyxiareset.com/
---
Based on the post where he states alliance hold areas some days and horde others and that it's all balanced I believe he was talking about his realm specifically. Since on the 70/30 realm I play on alliance holds nothing. We bring 10 they get 30. We get 30 they are starting to fill raid #2. That's how it goes where I, probably you, and many others play.
---
are you serious?
---
&gt; Horde races look more evil and attract players who like to pvp.
---
Is this why it's always Gnomes who gank me?
---
Sigh. Blizzard, this is the wrong way to do things.
---
What the GM should do is watch and keep track of people who exploit and permaban them. Sometimes it is necessary to cull the hordes of shitty people so to safeguard the majority of the herd.
---
Yeah once I hit 56 I leveled purely in dungeons and was almost full pre-bis by the time I hit 60. at 53-54 you can definitely go ahead and respec holy and spam BRD until 57 and then start doing every end game dungeon. People aren't as picky about the healer not being level 60 as long as you know what you're doing.
---
Wtf is this post lmao  
---
Bro just quit if you want to quit. Nobody here cares.
---
Do rogues not FAP vs you? I beat mages all the time with them.
---
Looking at bis lists a few will at least for the sets to pve in
---
Even between same lvl chars. You both know someone is near from the first second. No more ambushes or constant danger feeling in pvp areas if you always know when there is people arround. That's not the point of outdoors pvp. It makes it feel pointless and boring.
---
pvp system released, the WHOLE WORLD IS A WAR ZONE ITS GLORIOUS YOU WILL DIE A LOT AND YOU WILL FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE.
---
Sounds fun to raid log for content that is neither difficult nor rewarding.
---
That's not on blizzard. They made it very clear they were doing this... like the commenter said, everyone knew leveling would be difficult in P2 since BG's wouldn't be released until later.
---
My friends and I ensured we hit 60 before the honor system hit. We had the same information as everyone else. This should not have been a secret or shock to any if they paid an ounce of attention.
---
Oh, nice!!
---
I payed everyone 20g when it dropped but they also were doing ironfoe runs with me and we were all drunk
---
Please don't tell the alliance that I'm grinding the Scarlet Lumberjacks. The Gank squads do not seem to go there and stick to the fields. (Dalsons Tears is drenched in blood)
---
Also there are usually 2 alliance rogues (58) that are grinding on spiders there. They cool though.
---
So then choose to keep getting killed on a PvP server.  By the time you hit 60 on a PvP server you could have rerolled anything under 40 in a PvE server to match the time.  
---
To me, the extra time is worth the reward but for others it probably isn’t.  Either way, it’s a choice people make.
---
So glad I have vanish to break combat long enough I can click the flight path.
---
Feral has an issue which a lot of the other non-main specs have which is gear becoming more difficult to come by.  You can do well enough in dungeon blues, especially if you have enough pummellers, but it doesn't scale as well.  As other dps specs get better gear the offspecs fall off more and more.
---
There is also the issue of more things being viable over short bursts.  When fights are 30-60 seconds, the more powerful DPS CDs are played up, as well as specs which diminish hard over time.
---
Feral doesn't really get a big boost again until AQ or Emerald dragons when the feral AP weapons are added.  Until then feral gear is largely limited to random drops.  I only know of one hing from MC for feral, and about 3-4 in BWL.  They are better than healing gear and most blues, but that still hurts scaling.
---
Probably not, but they're not stealing because they own the game.
---
&gt; Just because you don't find something fun doesn't mean someone else has bad motivations for doing it, or that you're free to look down on them.
---
How am i not free to look down on them? I think you mean i'm wrong for looking down on them but i'm still free to do it and be wrong about it.
---
Thanks! That’s exactly what I had in mind and literally just moves the 3 from curse of weakness. Looks like I didn’t mess up too badly.
---
they'll find out before you get your chest
---
Had our first Onyxia splits last night! Then I farmed up all the mats for the agility arcanum. and then I went to bed. so.. progress?
---
This but use General Chat in Dire Maul so all the Hunters farming DM:N see your message, and offer 25g since you're a stealther and can get to the chest with no help from them once it's there. Easy mode Unyielding Maul.
---
Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've gone from 49 to 52 questing in Aszhara and Un'Goro since P2 came out.  I've been ganked twice.  Maybe the next zones will be harder or maybe its because I have KOS add on, which shows me when horde are around and I can just stealth and hide lol.
---
This. However, make sure the guy knows you want to do quest, because he might have a raid open for easy reset. Can't complete quest's in a raid.
---
Yes and now its reasonably balanced with more horde on pvp realms and more alliance on pve realms.
---
Due to the nature of these servers, only on pvp servers can players be slaughtered to a point of quitting or switching to the other faction.
---
If things keep as they are, even assuming that its just 1 battle group in each region (instead of 3 realm pairings like it used to be).
---
Thats still going to leave much more alliance players leaving due to this and causing an imbalance.
---
Top tier shitpost
---
SAME REEE
---
There's not very many available for a druid. I'm not really sure why.
---
Inb4 “found a soft beta man”
---
But if you’ve watched any of the duel tournament or maybe knew just a little bit about what you were talking about, you would know that mages cannot easily kill every class in the game. There are a few classes that will always beat a mage, and there’s a few more matchups that can go either way.
---
Yes on some other servers that's 70/30 alliance heavy the horde are feeling it the same way alliance does on my realm. This is of course obvious so I assumed I didn't need to state it.
---
*woosh*
---
Having a blast playinf Fallen Order.
---
Yet another huge mistake from the blizzard classic wow team
---
We knew this would be a disaster but they didn't listen ..
---
On grobb, disagree with that. Only been killed by groups, or people 4+ levels higher.
---
switch to anathema when out in the wild, shadow priests won't get attacked 1on1 so much :D
---
It's not a waste of time to help other people take down bosses they need. You're just selfish.
---
Yeah that's why I specifically said mages haha
---
If you do the jump to the ledge strategy, like we do, you can stealth before the adds arrive. 
---
It comes down the the burst from the 43% when the adds spawn. 
---
For anyone interested, you can find the rogue solo strategy on YouTube.
---
Haha remind me what that was from again
---
Unfortunately I think he is
---
Killing a level 48 as a 60 gives you honor yeah. But killing a 60 gives you 20x more. Just fyi
---
Who tf is lying? Look at any streamer on pvp servers. They need 30 minutes to a fucking dungeon. And that's with a goonsquad helping them
---
&gt;So you have the choice, do you wanna be camped 24/7 or do you want no PVP at all. 
---
Where are you getting camped? Why don't you just run away from the people that ganked you and/or bring friends to help?
---
I've gotten a few ranks in PUBG
---
This is great to hear. Fuck any alliance that transferred off Skeram. You abandoned your post, don't ever consider yourself brave. You are just like the Horde here - going for the numbers and fucking over other people to do so. I hope your gameplay is as imbalanced as you've made mine.
---
Congratulations Grunt.
---
Wouldn't if they just all complained on 1 post instead of making multiple stating the same thing. 
---
Then there wouldn't be a influx of people posting about complainers
---
Not to forget orc racials. Resist that one stun from a rogue and it can be the deciding factor in a duel/fight. The other orc racials aren't bad either.
---
I've been calling people carebears on this sub for the past 3 days I completely agree with you. Just saying by that definition of "griefing" you could easily argue that all pvp during P1 is griefing
---
Stop spreading missinformation. Fishing skill needed to not have a fish or essence get away in bay of storms is 440. Aquadynamic fish attractor gives +100, your pole gives +20 (alliance) or +25 (horde), which leaves you at 420 or 425. Well below 440. So the +2 fishing enchant is worth it, especially if you aim to get every essence possible from pools.
---
I hope so, i'll just quit until TBC is out.
---
Casual trash cans are important to the servers.
---
Blizzard telling the try hard players to shut down the levelers on their server is a dumb idea.
---
Another warlock that doesnt use raid frames.  What is it with locks and their aversion to frames?  Why do you make us yell at you for 30 seconds to summon a player instead of observing who is out of range on your frames and getting a summon going?  I swear warlocks are the worst offenders at not having raidframes.
---
8k hk in souths shore zero DHK
---
Bruh, that's the point.
---
Well, that's a bit of gatekeeping.
---
P1 was very close to what people wanted in Classic and rolled off the a great start. P2 though is a singular dump of just the honor system at a time where there are still a lot of people trying to level. Today we have a different WoW culture with a spy addon that has given the content starved WoW players a reward for essentially griefing on overpopulated servers in lue of actual content.
---
This is an isolated system that had a short run in Vanilla and largely fizzled out to normality with the release of Battlegrounds a month later. The initial release of the honor system was nothing like what we have today. P2 and the release of the honor system was heavily debated, but the #nochanges brigade won that argument.
---
We all know this is a short term thing, but Blizzard basically created a storm to emphasise the worst aspects of the original release. At least in the original run we had six months to level before this shit.
---
Is there a good equivalent for resto druid?
---
I do believe you but one tome I made a screenshot like this with elements fires, where o got lucky and killed maybe 5-7 that dropped 3, then I simply looted them specifically such that it looked like I got them all in a row. Sent it to a friend as a joke.
---
My friends asked me to roll on their server. I rolled a druid to lvl 20 after already having a lvl 33 priest on a PvE server. I realized that I didn't care for the PvP drama so I went back to my Priest on the PvE server. Those on the PvP server already stopped playing. Once I get the chance, I'll bring my Druid to my PvE server.
---
friendly tip, you will not get anywhere posting about TBC in r/classicwow.
---
come play TBC/WOTLK if you enjoy it so much. I'm having a pretty good time spread across the existing TBC servers (Netherwing, Endless, Smolderforge, Deathside).
---
as people have said, Classic+ is very unlikely and we can \*hopefully\* expect to see Classic TBC in the coming years. Until then just chill and mess around on the private servers that exist.
---
&gt;Orc stun resist is def the best pvp racial, but it's not an active ability.
---
The resist stun is the only reason my warlock is an Orc. I hate rogues with a passion. It's helped me win and survive many rogues in the open world.
---
Seems natural to see if people are having same issue sure, 
---
continuous posts about P2 pvp bad isnt seeing if people are having same issues, its posts complaining about same issues.
---
Totally! I’ve been thinking how cool it would be if pvp was its best self. If it was other 32s in your zone, it would actually be more fun. Then a person might come in on a mount at 40 and everyone is scared because he’s slightly higher than the zone. Instead we get swarms of 60s going everywhere. It can still be fun and low levels can still join, but it takes a lot out if it.
---
He's saying they're all big. I don't know personally, haven't looked it up. But I heard it many times.
---
There really isn’t a good spec for both. As far as raiding and pvp go you’re either going to be good for one thing and bad at the other, or bad for both.
---
That said, dungeons are really easy even in pvp spec since you don’t need as much hit as you do vs a raid boss, and everything dies so quickly that hemo coldblood is passable, plus if you want to live for more than a few minutes at a time in populated areas you’ll wanna be stealth a lot of the time so the faster movement is necessary.
---
You could do a standard pvp cold blood/prep with imp gouge until you get to the point where you’re raiding, at which point it all depends on how serious you and your guild are.
---
The other side to this is that combat is superior in dungeons and raids, and your spec isn’t going to matter when the battles are Zerg fests like they have been.
---
Overall there’s no spec that’s good for both, so choose what’s more important to you and test it out. Your first few respecs are cheap anyways.
---
Fire resist for your MT is more important than you seem to think it is based on your post.  Some raids will attempt to get their MT to fire resist cap before anything else, even going to BRS for the FR mind control buff on their first few raids when the raid's gear is still poor.  When your raid is geared and experienced it becomes less important to be capped, and then you focus on threat and DPS and back off a bit on FR, though it's still important. 
---
Hit% is still very important, and I'd value that over armor and defense.
---
World isn't ending if you are playing on a PvE server.  It is like nothing changed at all.
---
Are you stupid? I can't fucking hide or run away from corpse campers because they use spy addonn and are on me in less then 5 seconds. Even if I rez behind a rock or tree. Been playing long enough to know what I'm doing
---
You are misunderstanding. I was on my lv 60 the whole time. He killed me once with 3 rogues and I camped him until he logged off.
---
Hello, Op!
---
I play on golemagg-EU horde and despite faction imbalance several alliance guilds regularly wPvP, fight back, contest hotspots and even managed to take down Kazzak despite our efforts.
---
I suggest you organize, cooperate. Make a bigger group. Yeah, that takes effort, but evidently the wPvP is here to stay so one can choose to adapt or come to reddit and write about their frustrations. I got an inkling if al the effort spent complaining about it had been instead used to fight back, it would be better for everyone.
---
For those interested, have a look at our discord https://discord.gg/vcyGmaP . Alliance guilds frequently post snippets of their raids and wPvP adventures. It's possible.
---
Rank 14 is going to be no-life grinding for 10+ Weeks.  Your only option is to quit your job (if you have one) or account share.  Good luck to those folks trying for Rank 14.
---
Gold based loot system are better for pugs so raiders looking for gold can carry whales
---
Word, thanks for the information. Wasn't sure exactly how it works, just that I'd never turn down a free run through a dungeon if I have quests for it because that shit's always efficient even if I wasn't getting exp for the kills.
---
Feralas is a nightmare right now. Literally a squad of 5 camping outside the village and popping anyone that runs out of the town.
---
I'd consider 30/8/13. 
---
It won't be as good as hemo swords in PvP but it won't blow for raid DPS, either.
---
You realise that everyone that is worth honor is being killed? It's not like there are a bunch of solo-running level 60s exactly everywhere?
---
You're killing everything *because* you don't have a steady supply of solo-60s.
---
I am happy for you. If you are around 40 years old and get pissed off about that, it sounds like your life is pretty smooth in general.
---
Battle masters exist.
---
Ok boomer
---
You need to change every week. Their is no way around it. Sadly :(
---
I think you're going a little bit far when you say they're trying to ruin someone else's experience. If I gank a much lower level than me my first thought is " look, an actual player I can kill!"
---
I'm not thinking " I hope this ruins this person's day"
---
You either turn off auto-loot or shift-click the chest. That allows you to see everything inside, loot what you will vendor, and link in chat the items you wish to sell. 
---
Anyone that joins your party can loot the chest, regardless of when they join the party.
---
Cooking doesn't take a profession slot. So you got a slot still. Work on your Boss list and start your Onyxia attunement. Once your 60 slot of quests give higher gold now. Also do your mage water quest.
---
Saw a hunter doing hunter quest big mob in silithus.  I killed him like 15 minites ago.  Since the mob was at like half health, I /wave’d and sat to watch him do it (he also had a 57 warlock there as a bodyguard.
---
The warlock didnt attack me since he saw i wasnt attacking them.
---
Once he beat the boss they both /bow’d to me, and in return I /bow’d as well, then killed them both for honor.
---
All in all, I felt I was a merciful killer.  They got their quest done, I got double honor.
---
well thats not me misunderstanding thats just straight up new info that you were on a 60. 
---
But still - worth it for the kill likely. If it really bothered him he wouldnt have done it lol
---
sure you did
---
This isn't the playerbase making the decision but blizzard.
---
The game is rewarding those who get the most honor and you get the most honor right now by camping alliance at travel hubs/farming spots.
---
Hence, if they open bgs this would all stop immediately.
---
Oooh, I read it wrong :P
---
But he did get on with his leveling.....
---
The irony of asking that with a whiny Reddit comment
---
Not even a little similar
---
So why do you need the addon instead of just keeping the log open and using it?
---
Same as people do any fucking thing I  this game: make shiny colored number bigger
---
Next time can you do it without the bitchy reddit reply?
---
is that 150 prebuff or with buffs?
---
I don't really care about topping the charts - I'll just want to be useful and get gear so I can focus on PvP. I heard the raids are pretty easy anyway, so I doubt my spec will be an issue
---
of course its zugzug XD
---
If we have the time to play wow at all you can assume that already probably.
---
Newbie Troll Hunter here! I just tamed the ghost saber pet in Darkshore and I was wondering how Loyalty works. (Loving the class and I'm paranoid I'll lose my beloved pet.)
---
How difficult would it be to lose my pet at Loyalty Lv6? 
---
Does the level of the food matter when feeding my pet?
---
They were there yesterday. Look harder.
---
Bro I play Alliance on Skeram, trust me I fucking understand. Go do a dungeon, go join the PvP in TM/SS, level an alt you had planned to 20 in the meantime, get a large group to PvP, go farm in some far flung corner of the world, etc etc
---
There is plenty of shit to do. Yesterday we had a PvP group of about 8 running around and ganking. When the inevitable 40 people show up you just mount and move in the zone. It really isn't a difficult concept.
---
2 azuregos kills on netherwind, 1 kazak
---
I really recognise your name. Did you play vanilla? If so what server?
---
Yeah I tried to restore an item after around 3 weeks or so, and it was no longer available.
---
Everyone is camping the 48-60 zones. Thats where they get honor
---
I mean, apparently not.
---
Faction queues are the obvious, easiest solution. I welcome it with open arms as a horde player
---
guards can't reach you but the planetsmasher can
---
If you are reacting you are losing...also it's a pvp server
---
Same
---
It was more snarky and condescending than whiny.
---
False. I'll just leave it at that.
---
You can say that about most addons.
---
He didnt whine. You need to remove that filter you're using and read it again. He flat out said "u tried to be a douche, nice try. But I'm still playing"

I forgot this show existed. I remember it being on TV, but in the past 10 years since it stopped airing, I don't believe I have thought about it once, nor have I heard it talked about or referenced anywhere.

swiggity swooty she coming for that booty
---
Give night elves stomp and gnomes +10 fist weapon hit racial.
---
You need to get good and stop being shit. If you want to not level up to 60 go to elvwn forest and erp for a lil bit. :) I think I’ll go camp low level flight paths lol
---
I was killed 4x between chillwind and sm at level 36 at 8:30am this morning by the same shaman. Some people are just jerks.
---
Stuns dont work on mages? Who would have known
---
Suppose that depends on the tone one reads it with
---
Ohhh. Okay that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Can be annoying but a coordinated 5 man can eventually get to their dungeons nethwerwind tbh isn’t that bad and honestly I think a lot of the playerbase will grow bored soon.
---
Needing to be hyperbolic to make your argument means you sadly don't have an argument.
---

Im a Lock, I've seen maybe 2 lock pieces so far, lost them too ofc

Where can I find guides for Strathome, DM and scholomance?  I’m looking for something which goes over pulls, ways to tackle rooms and bosses.  Most guides I’ve found just cover bosses and quests.  I had a lot of trouble running Strat yesterday and I want to make it easier on others in the future.
---
It’s a chest not a corpse... need or greed does not show up. It’s the same in BRD council of seven. I have bought items from hunters before, this is a thing.
---
Hahahahahahhaha
---
“Still playing” wouldn’t involve stopping play to whine on Reddit.
---
Ideal would be two people a couple levels under the level to do the dungeon and a 60 running. You get the group bonus without splitting xp too many ways
---
Out of curiosity what rank did you hit?
---
Interact on left click is really nice. Especially for things like flight masters in neutral zones, or avoiding combat, and especially things like Qia in everlook
---
Cheap shot, u blink. I got imp sprint for ur nova and slows x2. Same goes with vanish. I can get out of ur nova 4 times if i want to.
---
Yes PvP happens where opposing players are.  BGs will come, in the meantime world PvP is fun and it makes the world feel like a battleground. 
---
It is the World of *WAR*Craft
---
What do you mean warriors for jump runs?
---
The downvotes are because of your tone. You assume everyone consumes the game as you, and are just doing unfun things because they want those purpz. That is simply not true, but you treat it as such. If you approached this without making assumptions, and looking down on people the reception would at least be less hostile.
---
Me too dude!
---
&gt;I genuinely think people are going crazy camping flight points and griefing all day because they have no idea that they will get nothing for the time invested.
---
no, people are just jerks. and it's mob rule; out numbering and out leveling people killing them before they can even move is entertainment. if they had to solo grind it out they wouldn't attempt it, but since there's no risk they'll gladly jump on board and join in
---
Pre-phase 2, naw a leveling guide including questing was way better!
---
Post phase 2, that's exactly what I've been doing. Find a spot way out of the way that no one will go to, put on 2 hours of youtube and auto attack away... Boy Paladin alt was a dumb idea lol
---
This does not work on my server atleast. Takes alot of time to actually fish up 1 stack. They only sell for like 2.5g. Not worth.
---
At max loyalty it is fairly difficult to lose your pet. Just be sure to keep a stack of food on you and feed it any time you see the mood indicator below your pet drop from green to yellow. 
---
Food level does matter for pets. As your pet levels, you get less happiness out of lower level food. You can see exactly how much happiness a piece of food gives your pet in the combat log chat tab when you feed them.
---
I’m pretty closely geared to this guy, save for weapon and bracers and it’s a lot of rng. My MC raids have seen so much mage gear
---

Has anyone found a working mod UI?   
---
Like the guy in the video, the UI he's using.   
---
I found some Mod UI links, but they're not working properly and not looking at all like the one he's got in the video.
---
You know video games aren't real, right?
---
I play on Pagle, and honestly the experience is quite nice. Im sure things will level out once BG's hit, but who knows when that will be. Meanwhile, Horde are killing the fun literally and figuratively.  Its the same as it always was, Horde is not better per player, they just have more players. Why would you play a pvp server as alliance? You like being dogpiled? This was easy to see, even before Classic release.
---
inb4 "no changes" (quoted by horde players) but BG's would make the experience a bit more evenly weighted.
---
I've never experienced as an actual raid tool. (Just as a method of selling raid items for gold. But I don't really associate gdkp with that, since that's literally just seller-runs w/ bid instead of fixed prices.)
---
I mean yeah its obvious they can talk to either faction, but I didn't know it could be done both at once. Just assumed they had the power to swap between Common and Orcish.
---
Really low quality shit-post, I give you a 1/10.
---
I am leveling a feral druid, and AOE aside the single target damage is very respectable. with pulls of 3 to 4 mobs I'm usually holding 1st or 2nd spot in the damage charts. Do Ferals fall off later on? I recently started using powershifting with the talents and helm, and the damage is pretty ridiculous tbh.
---
The less allies logging on the better.
---
Exactly lmao
---
you tuck your thumb "under" your had to press alt
---
"Unplayable"
---
If I respawn behind a rock they can't see me behind and i instantly stealth, they use spy add on so it didn't matter. The 1 second it takes to stealth on rez is all they need when 5 players corpse camp you. Then got honed in on my exact position and AOE it by 5 people tracking me, there's nothing I can do. Think about it before saying something stupid like that 😂 if 5 people want to corpse camp me and they spread out in my res zone there is nothing anyone can do. Even a rogue or druid will struggle with that.
---
lol wut
---
The servers arent empty you damn chode
---
Most tanks aren’t pugging because they have 40-80 guildies that need runs.
---
Okay thanks! I thought I did them all but wanted to make sure.
---
The add-on spy makes this pretty hard but if you're careful it's always fun
---
Imagine running dungeons in 2019
---
Jk I feel you, I feel like everyone is just raiding nowadays, wish I could tank my own dungs when levelling a rogue with my 60 warr :P
---
Your fun is costing the game thousands of players.
---
If they launched bgs you would be in there and having fun.
---
Most people I know (people who been playing this game for years) dislike this phase because the PvP is just camping.  There is no skill or challenges to it.
---
Yes, an instant que to your instant loss. I'll enjoy actually winning my BGs, thank you very much. :)
---
Go to the blizzard forums. More crying there
---
Small correction: It's not 1 person, it's the top .1%. Which can be 1 person, but can be multiple depending on how many on your servers faction had 15+ HK's that week.
---
&gt;You didn't refute my point. If something is a dumb idea why does it become "ok" because it was announced ahead of time?
---
I don't know what you're asking me this for. I don't think releasing world pvp before BG's was dumb. In fact I am having a blast, even though I am alliance on a higher horde population server. This is exactly what I was expecting, why I ensured to get to level 60 in advance of this releasing, and I am enjoying it very much. I wouldn't want to be leveling at this stage, but that's why I planned for that and get to 60... which is my whole point.
---
&gt;Why would some level 51 alliance player be ok with the game being unplayable because they announced this dumb idea before launch?
---
He should be 60 before phase 2 like me and many other players. Or, alternatively, have rolled on a pve server.
---
Again... world pvp, and the implications of world pvp, didn't just fall out of the sky. People knew what they were getting into why they created a character on a pvp server. For the few players who didn't, or thought it wouldn't be as bad as everyone was saying it would be, sucks for them... re-roll, find a guild to spam dungeons, or take a break to BG's. Your ignorance did you in unfortunately.
---
Oh. No. You probably gave like 60-150 honor against 2
---
Yeah, I preferred PVP servers back in the day; I like fair PVP.  This time around I knew I'd have big time restraints (I have a family now). I was worried about getting outleveled and constantly getting wrecked by people 10+ levels higher. But I wanted to play with my friend.
---
Now he's MIA. I've played with every free hour I've had, and I'm 50. Last night after the third time that a 60 rogue killed me in 2 seconds I rolled a new character on a PVE server. I'll probably go back after the dust settles...
---
He obviously assumed there was a benefit, and the phrasing of the previous comment ("no rank points") implied there might not have been, and so he asked for clarification.
---
That should have been obvious to you, honestly you gotta be pretty stupid to not realize that obvious context. It's obvious you didn't, so don't bother.
---

---
I use the Fight Club discord spreadsheet to sim my dps. Flurry Axe is better for my set up in the OH. You would never want to use it in your MH, as the proc triggers a MH attack, so you get a big slow heavy hitting MH/One hand.
---
Problem is that they won't.  Then they will say "You thought you did, but you didn't."  Truth is, this lies on them, like it did 15 years ago.  Absolute shit design and they failed to learn from their previous mistakes.  When creating servers, they should have enforced a creation queue to balance realms.  On P2 release they should have forced a faction specific queue to keep numbers near equal.
---
There are a lot of things WoW Devs could have done, but failed miserably at doing.  A company who can't learn from their mistakes are bound to fail.
---
Is that so? Damn, that actually kinda sucks. It can't be necessary with how much more populated the servers are overall.
---
Yeah when Census was working I did a census and there were mages &gt; hunters &gt; other classes (probably rogues). My alt is a rogue :) I feel so bad though that I can't give any buffs (at least with my hunter I could give trueshot and aspect)
---
Hell yeah Velsharoon, petty god of death.
---
Vanilla also didn’t have cross realm BQ queues.  Ridiculously long BG queues for the dominate faction was the mechanism that helped balance faction population.  Without it the problem only gets worse, and something needs to be done.
---
Too many people use the ignore feature to automatically feel like they won a disagreement, it's childish really.
---
Adios pussy
---
US Realm ?
---
i was riding to black rock mountain rode past a hunter ignored him, next thing i know he begins attacking me and almost kill him and a group of alliance round the corner and steam roller me into the ground, likewise i will now be killing alliance on site
---
Somewhere, somehow, we lost our way; We lost our Tegridy.
---
Lol, I’m not mad, I’m just having a laugh.
---
You think Blizzard cares? This will probably never get fixed.
---
They still haven't fixed the filter function on the restoration page that has been broken since Legion
---
I've been trying to implement a few things to prevent such abuse already, e.g. you can only send one karma per (target-)player per day. And I have some more in mind, especially regarding guilds. I am certainly also worried about this scenario, but you can do some things against it. Unfortunately you can never keep the trolls from using your software though...
---
And you can play on a PVE server.
---
Why do broken ally’s try to make this shit our problem? I’m having the time of my life farming allies 10:1. #winning
---
I have the carapace too, I start casting right after auto shot it seems to clip a little bit
---
Posting links to Google forms is against the rules here apparently, but I have started asking people here on a different post. If you'd like to help, the info I need is: your age, sex, your character's (or if you have multiple, your most played character's) sex, race, class, and your preferred role.
---
Can't stress how an early release of BG's will astronomically improve player game experience
---
Yupp rattlegore
---
To be fair regular DM is rough to find outside of guild runs everywhere I hear.
---
West is pretty cancer and most people avoid it like the plague, and East only has the key and jump runs.
---
And north is almost never done outside of guilds, why risk someone being an idiot eh?
---
But horde is overpopulated nearly everywhere. So there is no destination server. Not simple at all.
---
You can turn it whenever. Speak to Thrall first then to the dude in red armor in front of Org.
---
Yep I healed everything up until Maraudon as enhance.  Only reason I didnt heal Mara is I wanted to roll on all the DPS gear in there and didnt want to piss anyone rolling as off-spec.
---
By the time you level a hunter, no one will need to buy the gear anymore. I main a prot warrior and leveled an alt mage to do the ZF zombie farm. Averages out to 40g an hour depending on drops.
---
PvPers needed to make up their fucking minds. They all rolled over capacity long que servers. 
---
They were told they are idiots waiting 5 hours when there are other open servers. sure they had already played a couple of days, but when told "Just cut your losses and go to a smaller server" they said "LOL I AM OF SUPERIOR INTELLECT AND CAN FORESEE DEAD AND BARREN SERVERS. Normies will just hit level 20 and then quit or reroll... I will outlast them"
---
Then that didn't happen They were given the chance to transfer off and they scoffed again "Why would I transfer to a dead server?" 
---
Multiple times the Blizzard encouraged the community to fix the issue and players fucked it all up. 
---
Lets get this straight that Blizzard really fucked up by allowing alliance that are already outnumbered to transfer off the server, but why the fuck would horde transfer off to subject themselves to the imbalance the alliance already have?
---
Ouch, why is it so broken?
---
Sounds like it'd be easier to just put some guards up there or allow guards to climb walls or something.
---
Not at all
---
Raiding takes literally 3 hours a week right now (or less)... I don't understand the "not worth the effort" comment at all.  My guild raids on Tuesdays and clears Ony then goes and clears MC and we are finished in one night.  That leaves six nights to do whatever I want while also reaping the benefits of raid loot to improve my character.
---
I'll call a spade a spade here - I think you just want to quit and you are trying to convince yourself that by coming up with all these reasons.  Just quit and don't put a lot of thought into it.  It should be as simple as "This does not make me happy".  No need to run through this giant list of things to rationalize it to yourself.
---
No of course not, but in this situation the player is banishing the mob after the other player tags it, though I didn't know that was possible.
---
The irony is Blizzard had to add Blood Elves to the Horde in TBC to make Horde more appealing because of how outnumbered we were back then.
---
Did a PuG with some guildies, 1 resto druid. Dude comes in rocking greens off the AH, walks out with 5/8 set bonus and everything he could ever dream of.
---
Pools of elemental water
---
Im in a guild ZUG ZUG
---
because if blizzard lets you alliance carebears transfer off to pve servers it will fuck the faction balance up even more than it already is
---
I just give a friendly wave and drive through, about 75% of the time nothing happens or maybe they even wave back.
---
and how are you going to "give it" ?
---
Problems will start around level 30 - STV and beyond.  
---
Before that there shouldn't be many issues.
---
This for alliance they are friendly., to horde hostile.
---
Are reck builds still viable in classic since the /sit macro no longer guarantees a stack? I have been toying with the idea of a holy/reckoning build for pvp but I don't want to pay for the respec to test if it won't be viable.
---
It wasn't unavoidable, wow dev team failed to address the issue which caused the problem we are currently in.  They had 15 years of empirical data, but chose to ignore it go straight forward with this broken mess.
---
And rank 3 for 10% vendor discounts.
---
You know, you're right. Blizzard is already making changes from Vanilla and no one batted an eye. So if cross realm BGs are an okay change, why not faction buffs? 
---
Fuck it, add in Worgen early for Alliance side.
---
Someone told me there’s a 6 hour timer to get the buff? Also I want to get the buff
---
This is the only fact that I’m clinging to at the moment hahah 😂😂😂
---
Need 350+ to even be able to fish them tho.. 425 to never miss
---
unless you're an enhancement shaman. Then you should be grateful to ever find a raid spot.
---
Haha sure mate.
---
You said it wasn't a dumb idea because they announced it awhile ago.
---
That's a dumb comment.  Planning to do something stupid ahead of time just makes it even dumber.
---
You don't think it's a dumb idea to have all of the level 60s make the game unplayable for those who aren't level 60 yet?  So you think it's good for the game to have thousands of people quit?
---
It's just a generic guild name, no connection.
---
Horde is definitely not the better faction for PVP but ok nice post man
---
People are downvoting because you're an idiot, by the way
---
The general consensus is no, but I wouldn't push that butting anyways for safety sake.
---
Question: If NPC's automatically evade attacks from positions with impossible pathing, why can't the same thing be implemented for players?
---
PvP to PvE would further ruin many servers faction balance. It absolutely should not be allowed
---
Neutral auction house
---
Power shifting and spamming improved shred is really good single target DPS.  Out of all the hybrids, I have zero issues with Bear tanks or Cat DPS.  This totally has no bias as a feral player back in 2005 who was made fun of constantly for using the wolfshed helm.
---
Fair point. I guess I'm just saying I'll never be convinced that it's worth my time or in-game experience/performance to resolutely and solely farm a BiS item even if it takes 30,40,100 runs. I've been in many groups where a player is on their 70th or 80th run. That's crazy. I guess if you do a couple runs a day and spend the rest of the time doing something more fun that works out. That little voice in my head though is always wondering, what if I spend 20 hrs farming this pre-raid BiS and then next week get my raid BiS in MC or Ony, that would suck ha.
---
It comes back to that min/max mentality. I understand the desire to be optimally geared, it just sucks that that the game has been figured out to that level where we want all warriors for instance to have the exact same set for raid dps spec. And that set has these golden items that we're all farming for.
---
Thank you for your contribution to this discussion. It gave me a lot to reflect upon.
---
Constructive criticism makes the game better, I don't see a problem with pointing out improvements to a game.
---
Wowhead's list for Warlock is pretty scuffed.   
---
Green Lens +36 is better than the Crimson Felt Hat.  Sadly every mage and warlock is running around with the CFH. It's not bad, but not BiS.
---
Felheart pants are missing from raid BiS for some reason.  They're about equal with Skyshroud. 
---
They recently finally added some of the BOEs like bracers, hat, and feet.
---
Felcloth gloves are still oddly missing.  You can buy those without raiding, but they're missing from both pre-raid and raid BIS.  These are way better than HoP or Felheart for PVE warlocks. 
---
Sublime wristguards are listed above Felheart bracers, which makes no sense since Felheart is better across the board.

Lol I remember. No one wanted to play the "bad guys" and the Alliance racials seemed amazing. I rolled undead just because I was young and loved everything zombie back then.

This guy gets it
---
All the gamer dads have to get self validation somehow. Guess they think imaginary internet points is the way to go
---
Burden of proof is on you.
---
That said, I provided statistics of the constant growth of the player base around the time you claim Blizzard was merging servers.
---
That's more evidence than you were bothered to provide to back your own claim.
---
I doubt you're in a position to act condescendingly towards me, given the context.
---
and again, you are mentioning STV there.  
---
ot a word about P2 or wPVP  
---
Yes yours is bugged same as mine!
---
So instead of ignoring the question and not responding. You waste your time posting a paragraph and then complain about wasting time answering the question?
---
You have some mensa level reasoning skills bud.
---
The idea behind it is to create a system which controls the people getting top honor over the course of whatever amount of time.  By having a group of people control the top end honor, it allows those people to not only play "less", but control and stabilize the ranking system.  DUe to how you rank up, only a certain percentage of people can be on the higher ranks at a given time, and only a certain percentage can get enough honor to even make progress towards r14.
---
These systems work to ensure that those people who are serious about the grind are able to do it as efficiently as possible.  The reward is obviously making it to rank 14, but typically the groups have a queue.  Once the first guy gets it, obviously he then pvps less and ranks down and the next person is ready to hit r14 the next week.  As long as you put in the time and help others, you will get to rank 14.  By taking all or most of the other serious pvpers, you limit the competition and make the system controllable and predictable.
---
My server in vanilla was Boulderfist and we had a guild Shaman are teh Overpower who managed to get something like 40 HWL in just over a year because if you wanted to seriously pvp, you pretty much had to join.  They had the ability to out honor anyone else trying to do it on their own.  Everyone who wanted to pvp went in, pushed those ahead of them until it was their turn, got rank 14 and then could go about their life.
---
The system relies on quality organization and cooperation.  You need to identify which players are getting the top push and stagger them in a way where they are getting the top honor spots each each until they hit 14.  Do it right and the system is a conveyor belt of r14s coming out every week or every other week.
---
This might be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen written out on this sub, and that's saying a lot.
---
This sub is so skewed for pro PvP it's not even funny, where the fuck have you even been?
---
I tried to make a joke
---
My servers prices are so much lower lol, I think water are going for maybe 8g each atm
---
I’m talking about the pvp today being unavoidable. As alliance you have to go through raid camped boats and 10+ gank squads to get to any instance. The only way to avoid pvp right now is to sit in a city. 
---
But even the overpopulation issues were practically unavoidable since they released with too few servers.
---
You're a wacko.
---
What server are you on? It looks like no one has gotten ranks yet on Incendius-US. We are all still on week 1
---
so a normal transaction... whats is wrong about that ?
---
My whole point.. you’ve never done the dungeon so you have 0 experience in how it can work. Yet you claimed it was not possible as if you were sure of yourself.
---
It's always funny as a stealthed class to walk away and pretend you left and get them as they rez again
---
&gt;with the servers most skewed toward alliance
---
Battlegroup will end up heavily horde-skewed still.
---
You can't target stealthed people unless they are really close to you.
---
This is the second day, you bet your ass people will quit.
---
You need to relax old man.
---
Lol people are downvoting because a lot of them see faction queues as a silver bullet that also lets them pretend to stick to #nochanges. I understand their frustration, I do, and I'm not surprised that they've latched onto the idea. But, I'm also pretty sure Blizzard won't ever implement faction queues, so I hope everyone who wants that doesn't get too invested. 
---
"Horde is definitely not the better faction for PVP but ok nice post man"
---
They have the better PvP racials. Objectively better. That's why they're so popular on PvP realms. Why do you think there's such a crazy imbalance in factions? 
---
"People are downvoting because you're an idiot, by the way"
---
You wound me.
---
Agreed. Rhok'delar was my crowning achievement in vanilla. I helped so many hunters complete it because of how much I enjoyed that quest. While AQ40 and Naxx were great fun and challenging, the hunter epic quest is easily the best solo-content in game.
---
If you need to have a feral in the same group as your most geared melee, too hit the dps checks,  
---
 something is wrong....  
---
as an Melee and Tank i want to be in the shammy group pls, and maybe in a hunter one as well :D  
---
But it depends on the whole group ofcourse
---
If you level up high enough to tank dungeons where it matters you can bet your bottom dollar you will be a good enough player or straight up psycho cuz you will be levelling that slowly
---
I enjoy making references to [shows nobody remembers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H92Q1sGViuQ)

Discord handed out 3 month Xbox Game Pass subs, so I started playing Outer Worlds. It's the only other game I've played since launch.
---
Good to have this realization before you squander another year of your life chasing pixels
---
Okay, so, accept the following premises as true (because they are): 
---
1. It is possible for someone to enjoy world PVP but hate honor farming under the honor system. They are fundamentally different, especially on high population/faction imbalanced servers. 
---
2. Nobody had any reason to suspect that servers would be as substantially faction imbalanced as they have turned out to be when they were rolling characters in August. 
---
3. Many Classic players are returning players from Vanilla who quit and are not in the retail player base (I am one of these).
---
4. Players who quit during vanilla have not thought of World of Warcraft in ten or more years.
---
5. Players who have not thought of World of Warcraft in ten or more years might not remember the details of the launch schedule for various aspects of gameplay, and may have associated Honor with Battlegrounds in their memory.
---
6. Players who have not thought of World of Warcraft in ten or more years might not have anticipated the extent to which min-maxing and greater availability of information would lead to other players rushing to 60, getting fully geared, and starting to farm honor.
---
7. Even players who recalled the Honor system can be forgiven for thinking that Blizzard recognized in vanilla that releasing Honor prior to BGs was a mistake that dramatically impacted the quality of the game for many players, and that the Phase schedule could be interpreted as suggesting that the mistake would not be repeated.
---
When I re-subbed, I was thinking of *original* vanilla wPVP when I chose a PVP server. Everyone goes around questing and doing their own thing. Once in a while, you bump into some of the other faction. Sometimes they kill you, sometimes they don't. Rarely, they corpse camp you. 
---
What I wasn't thinking about was the brief window where Blizzard made an egregious error and released Honor without BGs. I certainly wasn't projecting that time-frame into a server with higher population or faction imbalance. I wanted to enjoy raiding Southshore/Tarren Mill, Crossroads/Menethil, etc. I did not want to get corpse camped every time I arrive at a flight point in Contested Territory. 
---
**I absolutely do not dispute that corpse camping someone is something that** ***can*** **happen in pre-Honor wPVP, but it's not an everyday occurrence.** The issue is not that people are killing me - the issue is that Blizzard's game design gives them an incentive to farm me like I'm a devilsaur, which means that I can't play any part of the game except for looking for wPVP raid groups. If I am specced and primarily geared for PVE (some people have to be, if you want to run PVE content!) that's just too bad. I don't get to play the game anymore unless I want to corpse run, 30 yards at a time, from a flight point to an instance. I can't do world questing at all without a raid group to protect me. 
---
That's fun for a few people, but most people aren't only in the game for PVP, even on PVP servers. That's legitimate. I enjoy the danger of *possibly* being killed when I go out into contested territory; I don't enjoy the certainty of it happening over and over. And over. And over again. That's what Honor system does, by creating the incentive to farm other player characters. 
---
I like PVP. I hate Honor. Given the choice, I would take a pre-Honor PVP ruleset. After that, I'd take PVE. And far, far after that, Honor. The only reason I haven't canceled my subscription is the hope that Blizzard will do the right thing and roll out Battlegrounds soon. 
---
But the true vanilla-experience PVPers aren't only looking for a roll-out of BGs immediately. It's the best solution for me, but not the only one. I would also accept Blizzard instituting paid server transfers. If they did, I would change servers, even though it would mean abandoning my guild and possibly my friends (if they don't transfer with me). 
---
Asking for *that* doesn't impact any of your precious Honor-era wPVP. You still get to turn the entire game into a PVP farming experience for anyone who remains behind on the server. 
---
If you somehow enjoy this phase and feel that BGs will ruin your fun, I can forgive you for being upset at the suggestion that your fun should be cut short. I cannot forgive you for harassing people who would accept either immediate BG roll-out *or* paid server transfer, because that wouldn't affect you - that's just you being an asshole and suggesting that someone should abandon 10+ days of gameplay worth of character development for absolutely no reason.
---
 Constructive criticism 14+ years ago lead to the TBC, constructive criticism 12+ years ago led to the wotlk, then to cata... so maybe you will feel yourself better in the retail version of wow and classic simply isn't for you.
---
Kirtonos ftw! Dayman the frost mage here; always down to do some content with my kirtonos bretheren.
---
Bone slicing hatchet is more dps in offhand according to my sim
---
OK boomer
---
Eh, you can two man it with decent gear and 5 runs takes 20 mins. If you're a warrior find a guildie healer who's prepared to commit to getting you the piece - offer to tank dungeon runs etc. in the future. If you're Horde you have your HS in Kargath anyway, if you're ally BRD is really close, so getting to the instance doesn't take long. You can fit in five runs in 30 minutes or less, and you rack up the runs pretty quickly. What you don't do is spam 'LFG arena runs' all day and do it with randoms. Then the grind is going to be awful, because the randoms are going to make you do Angerforge / Golem / whatever other garbage they want to do, you're much more likely to have muppets, and you're gonna worry about shaman/pally healers or hunters ninjaing the chest etc. etc.
---
where did you get "in their forties" from?
---
You could try to roll on the T0 set pieces that you could find in dungeon, mostly the visible one: shoulder and helmet. A caricature is also the shitty green leather helmet but I can’t remember the name.
---
Corrupted Blood plague
---
People think cause of 1 incident that WoW is some sort of hidden treasure trove of humanities secrets and potential research because of 1 cool thing that happened that resembled a real life pandemic / quarantine.
---
I rolled my eyes so hard when I saw the title of this post.
---
Yeah the fact the Corrupted Blood plague was studied IRL is cool. It is a fluke as opposed to the norm.
---
Yea but that doesn’t explain why barely anyone was doing it prior to the honor system. If people just did it cause it is fun, then you wouldn’t have seen this massive increase.
---
It is because he's doing it to a member of his own faction. It falls under "Griefing"
---
I have a feeling a lot of returning players know that Hunter is tougher than it appears for dungeons and much harder than how easy they are to level and so the huntard population is lower than it used to be. However I've run into hunters who are new to WoW in general and just aren't up to snuff. I did a BRD as a group of level 56 friends and brought a 60 hunter thinking we'd have some surefire solid dps. He barely beat the tank. /shrug can't win them all.
---
This mess won't end until BGs open
---
But blizzard will rush them out soon to fix this problem
---
IDK. they're not doing anything outside of the game. they're fighting for mobs. shrug.
---
Be sure to get your inc mount speed enchants/items!
---
Arena= 2 man and the most efficient way to do it.
---
"most" is not all. Use your imagination rather than asking dumb questions. A mage could spam sheep till it got off, a warlock spam fear, a rogue spam sap. etc. It doesn't matter if they miss, they will eventually land and there would be nothing the high level could do about it in the system the OP suggests.
---
Alliance doesn't have shamans :( as a tank I want 1 paladin 1 feral and 1 MM but that's me being a dps hoe
---
yeah i must be selfish since i probably did as much arena as any warrior on a priest. its just more efficient to just go for arena straight and dont bring anyone that need other bosses. And second wind is outclassed now anyways.
---
Here's the end-all be-all [simulator](https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/spell)
---
It's the man-cheetah
---
They're doing it because it's fun. Novel idea, I know.
---
32g*
---
&gt;my Herod character is horde, and my Heartseeker character is alliance.
---
This is the worst part of your plan by far; the gold exchange should be fine.
---
Guild people always say I'm ninja looting. Nobody seems to understand that it's not ninja looting if you can vendor an item for gold.
---
Yeah sure, your anecdotal evidence, is going to be the proof for all PVP Servers.  
---
It looks like you are so clueless...  
---
Have a good evening kind sir.
---
Yea i finally muted my first player the other day. Of course it's after PvP came out :)
---
Sorta speaks to how op mages are lol
---
Most people give up when the challenge is too big. It would definitely change their behavior if they realized it was all in or you get nothing in return.
---
You mean start playing a toxic undead rogue?
---
Fair play but I’ve yet to have this happen to me. The ally on my server always leave after killing me once.
---
I remember trying trivia in vanilla, but my dialup made it hard to ever get points lol.
---
Ok so take dueling for example then... I was dueling warriors  last night and they aways got the charge off because of spell batching. Should we never consider duela as a proper 1v1? Not considering any alternative other than a warrior never gets his charge off is legitimately so fucking stupid 
---
You’re either being purposefully obtuse or you must have been eating paint chips when you were kid
---
Yeah, I’ll go spend hours in the street begging people to play WoW Classic and roll Alliance on a server where that play experience is fucking awful.
---
That people who aren't good at video games prefer easy fights.
---
So what is your theory behind the massive increase in PvP? Why were people not doing it prior to the honor system?
---
because hemo / Swords is a viable pvp specc where you don't use ambush since you haven't skilled into the crit.
---
Depends for what farming mobs would be better solo questing could be done in groups and dungeons are always ok to run with a group
---
People would much rather be miserable and bitch on reddit rather than solve their problems and think rationally.
---
I applaud your dicision and I know you will have a blast!
---
That's... Crazy.
---
do whatever you need to do man, its rough out there like u say for casuals
---
you've obviously never played rogue, that's for sure.
---
I hope so, it would be nice to win something, but I have little faith.
---
That's what she said
---
"It's just a re-release so answering support tickets should be easy"  - How would that work? Do you want game developers and designers to answer support tickets?
---
Thanks Jon \^\^ Really glad you enjoyed it
---
Thank you for your contribution.
---
There is always retail....
---
Funny, I actually played PvE Vanilla through WotLK as a single guy. Now I'm married with kids and wouldn't play anything but PvP.
---
I was wondering what's the deal, but it seems just another PVP server problem. Ah well, have fun :D
---
&gt; I cannot imagine what it's like now.
---
Remember every time when you got killed and imagine if it was full 40-man raid of lvl 60s that corpsecamps you for hours and utilizes mind control to make you walk back to the center of the raid and be killed there.
---
Yes, because having 5 times as many people as we did in vanilla really equates to the same pvp experiences...
---
I played on pvp servers in vanilla, this is just unplayable due to EVERY zone having 60s in full raid gear camping everywhere.
---
&gt; Because you all want to change the game because you don’t like it. The rule on PvP servers has always been “I’m not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with me.” You’re not allowed to leave. 
---
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. When Blizzard instituted paid server transfers originally, they allowed PVP -&gt; PVP, PVE -&gt; PVE, **and PVP -&gt; PVE**. The rule was never "you're locked in with me." The rule was never "you're not allowed to leave." The rule was that you weren't allowed to level to 60 on a safe PVE server and then transfer your character to a PVP server to go gank people. 
---
&gt;Welcome to PvP servers, the punishment for not being able to handle it is rerolling in shame
---
All hail the Alpha Nerd! 
---
I don't give a fuck about your chest thumping. It's a shitty game right now, and I'm not going to subscribe to it in this state for long. I don't need or deserve to be punished. It's a fucking video game that I want to play for fun. If it's not fun, I won't play. 
---
Thank fuck that Blizzard wants our money more than it wants to indulge the cruel fantasies of ignorant little shitheels like you.
---
We like to bait the blink as well so we know it’s not an option when we push again. Or if you’re a jerk like me I have another rogue with me sitting blinking distance away so you blink into another cheap shot lol
---
If some1 was picking berries in a spot and you went there to pick the same berries and he puts a bucket over them, would you call the police on them?
---
Your making baseless assumptions. Yeah your a huge pussy.
---
no one cares OP
---
Just luck in Pug runs or greedy LC. I did my first 2 MCs with a pug since my guild wasn't ready and got both my Spellpower rings from by /rolling. Our guild is LC but we have 8-9 &amp; 4 Warlocks every MC so its difficult getting gear. I've only received 3 pieces of gear (Mageblade, T2 Pants, Mana Igniting Cord) since I've been passing on the T1 pieces since I know those will eventually trickle down to me when all the other mages don't need them. I just got really lucky winning both my Spellpower rings from pugs since I won't need to contest for them during my guild runs.
---
I'm running 31/20/0, and haven't had trouble tanking anything outside of raids (and it is enough to off-tank trash in MC).
---
Your mileage may vary, depending on your gear and the skill of your healer.
---
I ... i uhm .... yah fam im not sure what you on about but i think you're complimenting me
---
0.3% but yeah
---
Skinny weiners?!
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Good chance you're already wearing the iconic hunter look--Devilsaur, truestrike, mask of unforgiven
---
Lol Jesus Christ.
---
Do people not know how to use the "unpopular opinion" tag anymore?
---
With buffs.  
---
Or else it would be 210 with Paladin aura :)
---
You have a very very small amount of honor relative to your kills though... like 2.415 honor per kill if you exclude the 1 kill for 50 it shows for yesterday. How are you getting it down that low?
---
The community decides what posts do and don't make it with their upvotes. Not you.
---
You should definitely have a look at some decent mage vs rogue duels lol
---
How the hell letting 15-20k players into the world designed for 3k was "player mistake"?
---
Depends on if you hit crit cap if it's BiS. Once that 2% goes over crit cap, that item becomes hot garbage and gets replaced immediately.
---
sheep
---
I was not expecting all fair fights all the time. I also was not expecting to see this many people in the world. Also was not expecting this kind of horde: alliance ratio. Horde seem to out number me 2+:1 always.
---
Or... you could go get a job instead of trying to achieve Rank 14 in a video game.  Truth is you can't do both... so either be a productive adult out in the real world or be a real world loser with cool epics.  LOL!
---
I haven't actually done engineering myself but I know a lot of players who wait til 60 to switch to Engineering, so I imagine it's pretty feasible
---
There are no winners or losers in Warcraft. The game goes on forever. 
---
Speccing and gearing for PVE is not a bad decision. It's a group-oriented decision. 
---
Being an asshole to other people for no fucking reason is your choice.
---
Trying to quest during first days or even weeks of P2 is one of the most illogical things one can do in wow. Dungeon leveling is the only sane way for those who failed to level their characters while given more than enough time to do it and yes, your corpseruns to the dungeon is your price you pay for it. People who cared have one main for raids and one alt for gold farm already unless their main is lock or hunter.
---
If that's something you find unacceptable and can't deal with, time to reroll on PVE server, seems you have overestimated yourself. If playing on PVE server is something you cannot deal with, maybe wow classic isn't for you and you better off playing retail or different game even.
---
&gt; But for us, the people that are trying to get to rank 14 
---
You're posting on reddit rather than pvping? You are not getting rank 14.
---
One of my friends who never played wow said he would definantly roll on a pve server if he had to choose cause he knew he wouldnt be the first to max level. My friend who doesnt play wow is officially smarter than half of classic wow reddit.....
---
Bloodsail is great right now. Southshore and STV are both ripe with pvp but not having to worry about it while I’m not flagged is a massive benefit
---
No one id going to re roll,your an idiot as i said before they will just quit beforr having to start over again on a new server.
---
Pvpers will be responsible for their servers becomig retail all over again when thry die out. You will have no one to blame but yourself
---
Joke aside this happened to me. I’m the lvl 52 clothie in this story.
---
...is a garbage philosophy
---
Weedstocks have made me evil
---
you guys are fighting for a world boss. it's all fair game.
---
That was your mistake in phase 1! Death to the Alliance!
---
On Tuesdays I make a killing selling raid pots. Greater fire resistance potions, Elixir of superior defense, Greater stone shield potions, Greater arcane resistance potions. Some of those do require me fishing though And I do have and alt that disenchants for the dreamdust.
---
I understand what you mean but it’s the same etiquette that is used in real life. People but things on shelves in store assuming the customary thing to do it bring it up to the front and pay for it. Yeah everyone could just steal or “loot” it but they are branded as criminals, like you on your server. I’m just trying to help here.
---
Suppose that depends on the person reading it.
---
Maybe badly programmed bot which is just looking for the correct answer/word but not stripping the whole sentence someone wrote, so the output is just the whole line? Just a guess.
---
So if the server is imbalanced, and people roll on the underdog faction...
---
"rooftop rules" lmao why is this such an issue for people now? People have done this for 12 years
---
Cats use special abilities as their primary damage. For bears it's about a 40% damage bonus due to most of the damage coming from Maul, an AA modifier. Cats do less aa damage
---
&gt; Must be ~~game~~ faction wide.
---
Let's not forget horde can level, farm and quest everywhere unchallenged.
---
"you think you do, but you don't." Looks like he was right... For some at least
---
Lol if Horde wasn't more popular, then factions would balance themselves.
---
Thought the same thing. Could make him hold a xp share item would make this go a lot faster.
---
It wasn't a Warhammer Fantasy MMO, it was a Warhammer Fantasy RTS. Games Workshop pulled out when it was like, 70% done so Blizzard finished it, called it Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, and started millions on the path of addiction.
---
They also ripped off the Warhammer 40k universe, too.
---
Reckoning works differently than on private servers. There is nothing to stack. It works sort of like a parry does, but instead of lowering your swing timer, it let's you hit again immediately and your swing timer continues as normal. It's probably your highest single DPS increasing talent and can give you a ton of damage, but I haven't been able to really test it to see if it's worth going down to compared to the overall cc, damage. and utility you might get elsewhere.
---
Do weapon proccs that buff your character (like crusader) remain active on your character if you equip a different weapon?
---
EG can you procc crusader, with a slow weapon and an instant attack, and swap to a fast weapon with +5 damage?
---
Do innate weapon proccs work the same way? Like nightfall and bonereavers edge?
---
they can fix it without literally redesigning the buildings that allow wall jumping.  Exploit is used for things not intended which this clearly is.
---
I actually changed servers when I found other friends were playing together elsewhere.  When I started, no one I knew was getting into classic. 
---
Not to mention before with actual responsibilities can't hit 60 in a fucking week.
---
So try again.
---
That you could easily create an open arena TV show, to the death (?) if you propose a decent reward like a big enough pile of dollars, and some people will participate.
---
\*Someone suggests that PVP before Phase 2 is fundamentally different than post-Phase 2, and actually enjoyable, where Phase 2 is not.*
---
\*Ignore the comment, call them a scrub, tell them to roll PVE, carebear.*
---
:FeelsGoodMan: nice job! Scummy rogue players :P
---
It’s because you’re shit m8.
---
I'd be glad to help.
---
Skull of impending doom!
---
dunno man I honestly cant see that being a problem but I suppose is possible.
---
and sorry I didnt think of all the spells to think of a possible harassment technique and wanted to know specifically what you were thinking. 
---
Next time ill ignore what ever you mean and just make assumptions
---
I just dont understand why people get mad if you ask for help with a pvp fight. It would be the equivalent of getting mad for posting for help on a quest. But I guess they do that too
---
Most of us still feel the challenge PVP adds provides the most authentic classic experience. It's alright if you do not like it, we all have our preferences. Sounds like you'll have more fun now!
---
Before the Honor system died in the TBC pre-patch, i went out to the tram on my druid and killed a gnome NPC civvy that would repsawn instantly.
---
I racked up to close to 30k Dishonorable kills as a trophy before we could just buy Rank14 gear by doing like 10 BG's....
---
That's a big assumption.  Social scoring systems are bad.  If you can't figure out why then there is no use in attempting to explain it to you.
---
 How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way.
---
I tried elvui, found that it's too much, deleted ... and found that it screwed almost all settings.  
---
So I spend few hours trying to get everything back.
---
I don’t care who it is really.  The sentiment going in to classic was as little changes as possible.  Now everywhere I go I see whining and crying about how it’s too hard, and imploring that Blizzard push content out ahead of schedule because there little tushies can’t take some clapping.  Get over it.  PvP has been out for a week and it will quiet down some as time goes on.
---
You can take prep and imp sprint, you essentially just drop cold blood
---
With the amount of OMG PvP IS HAPPENING AND IT IS TERRIBLE that's gone on since release, Yes, even though the servers are horribly overpopulated, I have no idea why so many people rolled PvP. Especially if interrupted play and, you know, being ganked, isn't on their short-list of enjoyables.
---
garbage bait? i mean unless they don't pay it it's not garbage bait.
---
Nice constructive feedback. Just kidding. Twat-like behavior.
---
They attempt to park characters to block the FP. Varies from mounts, ogre suits, giant growth/winter fall elixir etc
---
I’m aware of a way around it clearly by the fact I have the flight menu up, it’s just amusing to me that these people go out of their way to attempt to grief and still fail at it
---
Not on T1 where most bonuses are shit. You just want one big MT and then whatever ups your raid.
---
The problem isn’t lazy ness. The problem is that any and every move they do, it is inevitable that they will loose players - those who have friends outside of the guild etc, or simple don’t want to for whatever reason. If you are a 50 ppl guild, that may be little enough, if you are a far larger - 500 people for instance, it may be a fair amount. Either way, speaking as a GM myself, the thought of losing players and having to recruit does not entice me. Last but not least, if you don’t have a clear policy on the matter of transfers, some members may not wish to join for the fear of you moving away. Stability matters, in all things.
---
Nothing.
---
People are playing to maximize the number of Honor and Rank points they get.
---
This isn't new, interesting, or unexpected.
---

For arms warriors focused on pvp, do you no longer care about agi the way you did for fury dps in pve? 
---
I've noticed I'm getting deleted wearing my fury high dps pve gear in world pvp as arms (even if i'm not in zerker stance). When i switch on my tanky gear with high strength and stam, I notice a considerable drop off in crits and big white hits, but I last long enough where people I'm fighting start panicking and I'm able to finish them off. 
---
What is the stat priority for arms pvp warriors? Is there a target hit %, crit %, strength/stam/hp amount, etc? 
---
Also, is Zerker stance almost never worth it in pvp? It certainly seems to be the case given how often I'm melted when I switch to zerker for more than a second.
---
"That's not on blizzard. They made it very clear they were doing this... like the commenter said, everyone knew leveling would be difficult in P2 since BG's wouldn't be released until later."

I reserved hoj and got mine.
---
To all the warriors - reserve what you want. You have the privilege of being one of the only viable tanks. groups need you.
---
There is not an equivalence between “being able to find a vanilla pvp video in which the addon is used” and “nobody having used the addon.” It is quite clear that it both existed and was utilized by players—you can do your own research to glean the extent of its adoption if you so desire.
---
I have consistently claimed only one thing: that Spy-Esau’s addons existed in vanilla (actually, in vanilla, these addons were *much* more powerful). If you want to try to find video proof, that is your prerogative, but I have supported my claims, and won’t jump through hoops to further support your ridiculous requirements for conceding my point. Now, it’s past time that I exited this conversation.

I tend to enter blackrock mountain from the south - stil get wrecked when inside but I usually make it there without too many issues!
---
Really? Guild groups =/= PuGs.
---
I can tell you first hand.  Alliance on Herod are strong and coordinated.  When they hold BRM, its impenetrable. 
---
Thorium point is nightmare.  Kargath gets raided constantly.  
---
I dont know what leveling is like, but at 60, Alliance hold their own for sure.
---
I genuinely don't understand that there is a difference between World PVP where there's no in-game incentive to farm a level 51 for two hours while he tries to run to Blackrock Depths, and World PVP where each kill nets you honor so you treat that level 51 like a fucking Devilsaur for his sweet, sweet Honor points.
---
They die, and quit, because 4:1 Horde imbalance on a massively populated server is actually worse than it even sounds.
---
Says my character was last updated on the 14th of this month. Yet shows a gear load out I last wore 3 weeks ago, not 5 days ago.
---
Why are you on this reddit?
---
With decent dps melee can stay in and fight on Shazz no problem
---
&gt; wish you nothing but weeks of moderate inconveniences 
---
That filthy human is going to stub their toe so hard this week, don't you worry.
---
Not to mention that's an snape absolute shit response to an actual problem. If this is so great, why is your only response to "avoid it all costs"?
---
Obviously there's something broken and that's the MASSIVE population from original vanilla.
---
Actually Faerlina is one of the only good PvP servers that doesn't have an absolutely scuffed faction balance. Most people complaining are not on Faerlina
---
Im on an alliance majority server and the reverse is true.
---
No, ignorant players that should have rolled on pve servers fucked up.
---
We haven't failed anything. The first few days were hell but it's business as usual on my server now, stalagg alliance, 75% horde and I still run into the same people from before it was giving honor.
---
Cumin
---
Nope, epics like underworld band can drop. Mageweave on my server sells for 70s-80s a stack - usually get 3 stacks per run. You also get a lot of superior healing pots which sells for around 50s-60s a stack.
---
What? People are complaining about quest difficulty?
---
🤣
---
Tempest is making a name for itself.
---
Ironforge.pro
---
Nah, it's not BGs that will be the problem. If significant numbers of players quit on the alliance side (or they simply xfer), there will be a larger problem down the line. Hint: it's a certain event that involves a lot of required farming on both factions.
---
Yes, I’m sure that was his intention.  He killed an honorless target while they were taming a generic pet to learn the prowl ability in order to assist their own faction.  They then returned and camped the pet of said honorless target to attempt to make the pet abandon them, all to help out their own faction, once more. 
---
Or, alternatively, they were just griefing. 
---
One of those two.
---
Have you learnt your place, mortal?
---
Mate, OP is being sarcastic and so am I, really didn't think it could be any more obvious.
---
That's not the point. I never intended for the situations to be directly comparable, rather, I was questioning the usage of the word "snitching".
---
exactly this... it is only as hard as the other people in your faction want to make it.
---
You think you do, but you dont.
---
And here I am loving the fact I can raid and quest when and where I want, but then go to South shore and enable pvp for some fun time pvp.
---
Start the group yourself.   
---
The reality is that lower level guys pull aggro from farther away, so you have to clear more stuff to make a safe area to move and fight in.
---
Yeah this is true, and a recently fresh 60 engi mage friend of mine deleted me, except when I HoJ proc crit him one time..
---
In general though plenty of mages just don’t kite well atm and don’t have rocket boots or grenades. Whereas I’m always able to catchup if they don’t poly me (which most don’t?)
---
Disallowing the opposition faction from getting new pets that will be used to kill our fellow horde is as honorable as it gets.
---
&gt;mage’s teleportation (which is faster but consumes mana every jump)
---
I am pretty sure you mean blink. Because if you are trying to claim that teleporting from TB to OG is worse than running that distance in travel form i dont know what kind of drugs you are on :D
---
Yikes. Do you not see the irony in this post?
---
Here's my experience with that though. Horde tries to kill me on the way out, I fight back, the 4 other horde in the near vicinity come by and I lose. The guy questing leaves and the other four Horde patrol around killing me for the next 20 minutes.
---
People will choose to die on the hill of toxicity. They would rather uninstall than admit they are ruining the game for others.
---
How is banishing another players mob fighting for a mob, you don't have the tag before or after the banish.
---
Don't tell them our secrets.
---
Let me ask to see if you can clear this up, how is repeatedly banishing a mob "fighting for mobs"? I am curious how you rationalize that.
---
In situations where that may be the case, which is likely few, the honorable kill would still be tallied, but then give no honor.  There is also the back and forth of killing, such as in Hillsbrad, and the time given to reset the % honor gained.  There were only very singular instances of camping for kills, in response to the same, so very few repeated kills.  And as mentioned, not done to the point of honorless kills.
---
Here there are kills shown missing entirely for the week, where as my GL engaged in similar tactics, and had all kills but one recorded.
---
While I agree somewhat with what you're saying, you can't complain about people whining about PvP and say we should focus on faction imbalance, when the cause of much of the complaints *is* faction imbalance - yes, phase 2 has increased the amount of ganking, and rightfully so, but all the legitimate complaints about PvP have stemmed from being heavily outnumbered, removing a lot of the fun and skill in open world PvP. Most people playing on PvP servers are more than happy to get ganked, as long as it's reasonably fair and they can retaliate.
---
meanwhile that isnt even worth 40g on my server maybe like 20-28g
---
I feel like I heard this in August-- something about everyone leaving in a month?
---
Low effort.
---
Ah; can't judge you for that then.
---
Where in that did I say I thought world pvp was dumb like you're claiming?
---
Try to keep up.

More people the better, the game feels more like a community and more fun than ever, I’m leveling currently in my 40’s by questing and it’s the most fun I’ve had in the game so far, always having to look out for gankers and fighting other alliance lvl 40’s that come near me is great (I’m Horde)
---
I basically ignore whenever my guildies are already at the dungeon and they invite me late, telling me to be careful entering.
---
Stealth or hots and bear with 7k hp, I'm fine until it's 4v1. And even then, feral charge into dash lool
---
Maybe you could limit it to people currently in your group
---
It's because you are Grey.
---
There is no need for hit% in pvp. You priority should be Stamina, crit, strength. You'll need to stance dance, using berserker rage to cleanse/prevent fears, and enter berserker stance to intercept, but you should mostly stay in battle stance.
---
Because of the heals or why?
---
lol u maed a funneh! 
---
Obivously it's not about the PvP in itself. It's about the massive amount of Horde compared to Alliance.
---
I'm ganna use this knowledge to 2 or 3 man farm him for my warrior buddies.
---
It seems like you fought him around the corner, and at the $% he summons his adds, they went to the location he was attacked at but had no LoS on the group so they just sat on their hands as they didn't aggro.
---
I just don’t find myself with a lot of gold as a warrior, where FAP would be 2g per mage fight
---
triggered...
---
Hmm it’s almost like there was this exact dispute that happened to a content creator and the GM realized he was a clown 🤔
---
Meeh, it is fun to be challenged.  Hate people that get pissed if we wipe once or have a few players die. Not all of us know the min/max or forgot the fights. Just part of the fun figuring it out, else it gets boring.
---
Like I am the actual only person in the world that enjoys being outnumbered? 
---
I play on a realm that is 3:1 Horde sided and the only thing that sucks is the FP camping. But even then you gotta group up and take different routes to get to BRM for example. 
---
Also this kinda stresses how important guilds are and that you should form alliances with other guilds. 
---
Basically the only people that are fucked by this are solo players or PUGers who have a hard time getting anywhere. But if your guild is halfway organized you can stomp most Hordes even if you are outnumbered, or go with another guild and form a huge zerg.
---
It's actually kinda fun now that the world is at war.
---
If you're alone on the spots, yes. Competing with other mages + getting ganked, 4 days seems hard.
---
My raid leader used to say, "If its red, its dead."
---
No mercy for them.
---
If you decide to join us on BB, you need to know of Denbu, he is a meme on our server.
---
Rank 0. I rolled PVE and am so glad I was right about how stupid phase 2 was going to be. The daily salt from this sub is great.
---
I don’t see how it’s a bannable offense if there is no wall clipping? It’s not hard anyone can do it.
---
Dude what
---
yeah im stoked for the changes.
---
Bruh what you trying to say about Zug Zug. lmfao
---
Oh my god a fucking heavyweights quote? Never thought I'd see one of those again. Cheers!
---
Killing a 48 as an even modestly geared 60 is absurdly easy and takes about 2 seconds. Killing another 60 who might be better geared than you will take 20x the effort and 10x the time, longer if you manage to lose. 
---
I'm not saying genociding players that can't fight back is ethical or good, just that people are lazy and it's risk-free honor. 
---
Personally, I think killing anyone more than 15 or 20 levels below you should be a DK and only players within 8 levels should reward honor.
---
You kinda took this too far, bruh. That literally was my point. These folks are overgeared ***and*** bad to be slappin' around 47 hunter in Searing Gorge. The helm was the only immediately recognizable piece for me, so I just pointed it out.
---
It's not the quests that are difficult. Just getting ganked is
---
Seriously people think it's cool to just outgear everyone instead of outskill? Pretty sad. Who cares if you have to be a meta class, thats why I like easier leveling of classes so you don't waste 8 days played on the wrong one.
---
How is that racist lol
---
Happy to help, it should serve as a basic totem compendium. Oh, and use Earth shock to interrupt - and use it a lot; keep rank 1 on your bars in addition to the highest rank, if you only need to interrupt and don't want to burn away all your Mana doing so.
---
This is all good in MC but in next contents fights won't be 20 seconds.
---
I like the hussle in chat though. 
---
VC runs for 5g each? that's some expensive boosting right there.
---
Anyone else get the constant spam in trade chat for full MC runs? You have to join their discord or skype for it. Apparently they're trying to get you to pay actual money for a run through MC to get a CHANCE at gear...like what? Join a pug and get carried!
---
It’s the first week of honor and already people are saying oh woe is me, this cannot go on much longer.  Pepper your angus my dude.  I remember being camped endlessly while trying to quest in vanilla, do you?  
---
Everyone so used to ez street gaming they forgot about what it meant to be frustrated by a game.
---
Sitting at work, just wanting to get home to login to check :X
---
Got about 15k honor last week, Kurinnaxx Horde.  Hoping I'll be R3.
---
Make sure to need BRE cause it has good stats
---
Literally didn't even say the class, I thought it was hunter for a while since you said pet until you finally say drain tanking at the end.
---
i really dont want changes and i feel like blizz promised people the chance to wpvp rank 
---
while i feel the high population on servers has impacted this and bow fun it is more than anything i feel like turning around and just bringing out bg's is a terrible fix
---
they should let the wpvp's hit 1-2 r14's then bring out all the bg's at the same time
---
if they bring out one bg early it should be av because wsg is the mkst efficient at ranking and av at least still feels lile world pvp or close to it
---
Gribwerts School of Parry and Misery
---
Not really. Came back from long vacation and tried to play. Didn’t enjoy myself so I stopped. Pretty simple reasoning I think.
---
I think the design of how the game plays out is poor and not enjoyable to me. I don’t fanboy over games but I do understand that a lot of people do and they don’t see any wrong, ever. This is common in every single game out there.
---
Same I was passive af, pre-phase 2. As I literally moved servers just for a better start as I felt bad.
---
But ever since phase 2, I’ve changed. I’m full BiS Frost Gnome Mage that have switched to Full PvP and went from top 3 DPS to top 10 DPS just so I can kill any honor-giving Horde that moves.
---
Jerry devoted is a pretty good guy
---
Surely you are joking. Neither of the two words _blacklist_ or _whitelist_ have [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting](anything to do with _race_). That you are making such connotation is nothing but ridiculous.
---
no, people are complaining about getting killed for honor while trying to quest
---
&gt; Plays game for it's renowned difficulty and tedium
---
&gt; Complains about it's difficulty and tedium
---
Smh
---
I like psychic screaming their mobs
---
This guy could fly around, use all spells and heal his allies while beeing invincible on the gryphon. lmao
---
Currently Level 38..what are some nice (dont have to be THE best spots) to Grind some exp and Gold?
---
People are going to ruin their own servers because they don't see the bigger picture.  
---
They think getting a little jump start on honor farming is worth absolutely wrecking things for people who are trying to level up (these are the people you need to keep replenishing the ranks for your level 60 turnover)
---
I loved the battlegrounds in that game. Being able to control towers and keeps was awesome. I never did much world pvp in that game though.
---
Yes Tolkien was a big fan of making his world's history cyclical.
---
Every time I get ganked I just use that aggression in other forms. Meaning when I sign onto Overwatch after to play like a man on a mission.
---
Yup, leisurely to say the least
---
You should make it so that you only can give positive feedback on a guy. With maybe some presets like: great leader, good teamplayer, good dude etc. Because people will abuse the shit out of the upvote/downvote system. And maybe make it so that you need go be jn party for atleast 30min? Idk. Gl though
---
New wow player here. My buddies convinced me to play wow, never have before. Chose to roll warlock.
---
Hit level 60 last week en got invited to my first Molten Core + Onyxia last Sunday.  
---
We cleared both without wiping and I didn't die so that's great.  
---
However I feel like my performance was totally shit. I was by far the lowest DPS and I feel like I can do better in future raids.
---
Gear-wise I have most of my pre-raid BIS and I was using GFFP, mana pots, arcane pots and shadow pots.
---
So I think it's more of a rotation kinda thing I need to improve on. Upon further investigation I see other warlocks popping death coil aswel as shadowburn, which I didn't.
---
My build is SM/ruin
---
Any tips &amp; tricks from fellow warlocks are much appreciated!
---
It’s bis for orcs
---
I think they mean how do you have the time to level 4 60s when classic has only been out for just under 3 months.
---
Omg a clicker, I didn't know you people still exist
---
Lol you think raiding people have "skill"? anyone who thinks pve is hard isn't skilled. Pve is about RNG and who you know
---
It was this way when Vanilla dropped Honor for a bit then it fell off. Once Battlegrounds come out it will help, but even then from time to time be prepared to deal with ganking and PvP while questing. That’s part of it on a PvP server
---
lol yeah I have a lowbie pally on there as well
---
I'll usually leave lower level players alone...unless I've been getting ambushed by their faction constantly. Then everyone on the other team gets got.
---
0 to 100 or -100 to 100 are just semantics, there is no way to stop abuse in a system like this.   Prejudging people because someone else didn't like them is foolish.
---
OP, there is a really old school build called Moonfury PVP Healer.   This build centers around both healing and being able to drop a bomb on your opponent.   It's very very powerful but you need to understand how it works and will take practice.   It's based on being slippery, rooting your enemy, and dropping massive nukes on them while also keeping group alive.   
---
It's one of the most fun druid builds you can play.  It's basically like being an Affliction Warlock with Resto druid, and if you find a window, dropping a massive nukes on enemies.  The better your gear, the more insane it is.   Your only nemesis with this will be warlocks w/felhunter and skilled hunters, everything else dies unless they just downright outgear you.
---
Add Engineering and it's PvP God mode.
---
great, thank you.
---
Quests? I stare death in the eye with an empty quest log.  
---
Back in Vanilla days I was farming mobs mostly (because it was the only way to level in kMMOs where I came from). I got to level 30 that way.  
---
And now (since I don't have much time to play) I only focus on getting rid off my rested bonus as if it's some daily/weekly quest. So... I farm mobs yet again.
---
Yeah, there is absolutely no-way this isn't going to be completely abused to the high heavens. Especially with current year cancel culture in full swing.
---
90k honor still no rank.
---
15 years later and blizzard somehow forgot how to run all the updates at once.
---
11k HP. Unranked.
---
Drop Staff of Dominance for Mageblade
---
What class? I would focus on what items stays BiS till the latest phase. Items that get replaced in phase 3 pve should have less prio over items that are BiS till phase 5.
---
I wish there were more like you :)
---
It was pretty hard to foresee that blizzard would introduce these massive servers though :P It kinda forces the issue quite a bit!   
---
"No changes" would have been good, but they implemented a huge change with these server sizes and ofc that has an influence on many other elements of the game as we can clearly see these days :P  
---
We just have to survive for a week or so and things will normalise again - that's my prediction at least.
---
Nah, you're good. It's a weird transition for Druids-- our class quests all seem to come very early: bear form, seal, and poison removal all happen pre-20.
---
TURMERIC.
---
It's funny that this is always how alliance generalize horde, but I legitimately just like the Horde as a faction more than I like alliance. I really couldn't care less about the racials or flight paths or zeppelins. I just want to play an Orc.
---
Oh yeah, totally sucks that you may get killed **IF you turn pvp flag on in a HORDE ZONE**. Menethil is a fucking Alliance harbor with no defense in a contested zone. 
---
Stop complaining Horde cunt.
---
Yeah. I love the "just waste three months of your life getting back to where you were" mentality. People can't admit that Blizzard fucked up by making less servers with bigger populations which has caused most of this. Honestly, I believe,  most of this won't be an issue once WSG comes out and when most of these people realize they didn't rank very much doing what they've done all week.
---
Well don't go on my boats in Menenthil Harbor lol
---
Ok snitch
---
Yikes that is a stupid comment.
---
I'm on a 40/60 server, I didn't know this was coming. Playing this game makes me annoyed, miserable and angry. Except for raid nights.
---
Anger, hatred, fear, these are weapons of war. The tools of a Warchief!

---
First, that's earthbind totem.
---
Second, Pservers and classic servers have extremelty different melee ranges on mobs. On a Pserver, this kiting method is very effective since mobs melee range is 2-3 yards. On classic, mobs' melee range is around 8 yards making your circular kiting into high effort with a near zero reward.
---
BASIL
---
I think what you meant to say is “the game is not balanced around 1 on 1. However, if it was, mages would completely fucking busted”.
---
Na I 100% get it I am just salty about T2 helms hahahaha. I just need a hug is all lol. 
---
Yea i don't get people killing greys I mean.... I have done it especially like right after hitting 60 but.... at this point I just leave people alone. I don't even like killing people who are green but like level 49-56. I will sometimes but usually try and leave them alone as well. But if you close to 60... I want your honor nothing personal.
---
Lol, right?
---
Yes, you can also use the addon "offline", as a personal notebook. This is what I started with until I realized it might be interesting to share information. I definately don't intend or support inappropriate downvoting of players.
---
so you sit somewhere in Darkshore killing lvl 12 mobs?
---
Why do you think Horde would want to Nerf their gameplay by fighting in BGs?  Like, if you can just CC and contest farm zones at a 4:1 ratio why would you put yourself at risk having to take a 1:1 fight? 
---
Personally experience from Skeram is that horde lose every fight until they have a 4-5 man advantage so why are they gonna waste time in a BG queue to inevitably lose
---
Except the terminology has nothing to do with race, and was a random term chosen by some guy long ago. Whitelist was chosen because it's the opposite of black.
---
How about you go on out with that PC bullshit. If anything, stop calling people black and white.
---
I can use Reddit without using the voting thing which is also incredibly stupid, I see your a big clicker though.
---
I think arenas in classic would be fun. Don't have to have any rewards just fighting new people everytime in fair environments.
---
Because red is dead
---
Reroll Kromcrush, my experience has been good there so far.
---
Quests. If you’re dead set on grinding gorillas in STV.
---
&gt; No they're not. If they were, they wouldn't be killing lowbies, they wouldn't be killing you the second you land, and they wouldn't be corpse camping you for hours at a time. 
---
Well, they're out there farming Honor, but while they wait for the next honorable target to come by, they're going to kill the lowbie because it's convenient. And they're content to kill you the second you land, because you have to respawn, and then you'll be worth honor. Which, incidentally, is why they corpse camp you for hours.
---
The reason that there was a fundamental change when Phase 2 dropped is because of Honor. Honor is the worst-designed system in a multiplayer game I can think of that doesn't involve microtransactions.
---
You can’t buy your own auctions.
---
Tbf he has a warlock flair.
---
oh you're white
---
No, a 48 is not worth Honor to a 60. A player turns grey a -11 levels. That’s why the pvp brackets are in groups of 10. And even so, being just 5 levels below (55 vs 60) you get severely reduced honor. A 1:1 kill of even rank and level is 200 HP. An even rank kill on someone -5 levels from you is about 80. There is a very sharp diminishing return for repeated kills as well. On a 1:1 fight, killing someone a second time soon after they res is about 140 HP. After that 100, then 40. It’s drastic. This honor is then split evenly with anyone in your party wether they hit the guy or not. 200 becomes 40 for a fresh kill in a 5-man. It’s not long before that’s 5 or less.
---
It's just a word
---
I think we need a post about people whining about people whining about people whining.
---
Blizzard is bad at lieing. They said they would not give us true Vanilla experience. Yet here we have bugs still in the game
---
None of that is a necessity in the game. None of that inherently makes the game better or worse. That is all subjective. Stop being such an obtuse ass over the concept of PvP vs. PvE and let people do what they want. Congrats, you play on a PvP server and probably roll out with those gank squads to stomp solo players. Congrats on that huge digital wang you have there, participating in PvP.
---
Stupid question since I last played Feral 10 years ago and am leveling now.
---
I used to be able to insta-charge after shifting into bear form but lack rage now. Is this a talent I need to still unlock?
---
Hey i've had it with you bitch ass whiners, and heres why:
---
Actual unpopular opinion: I want my runs be as smooth as possible
---
I wanna give him the benefit of doubt and say he’s been grieved by overwhelming Horde gang bang death stacks.
---
But he’s a Gnome Rogue. No-one rolls Gnome unless they wanna PvP for that sweet ET racial (or are mage/warlock, where they could just roll the class for better PvE DPS).
---
Outplayed
---
They're all cute untill they're 2 and you're 1.
---
Slightly different than your messaging:
---
You have 2 options to hit rank 14 (both require no-lifing the game for 6+ weeks to achieve):
---
* grind rank 1-14 in 12 weeks by hitting bracket 1 each week
---
* grind casually to rank 9, then pick 6 weeks to go hard finishing ranks 9-12
---
Most players will NOT be able to hit rank 13-14 unless they play nonstop during the specified grind period (6-12 weeks). This is due to honor decay, which is greater at higher ranks. Getting set back on the grind by not making the top bracket can add indefinite time to complete your goal.
---
There is a difference between something that sounds as benign as "PVP on PVP Servers" instead of saying "The inability to quest, or otherwise progress outside of dungeons".  See when you say it the second way doesn't it sound like a shitty experience?
---
There is one thing I think it's important for people to know.
---
When the AQ event started, there was endless bitching from people who said leveling was almost impossible.  Whether it was a late comer to the game or someone leveling an alt, they were bemoaning the amount of 60s in their low level zones farming wool cloth.  People bitched about trying to level professions because prices were skyrocketing.  Lowbies were being ganked because 60s were in the area or they wanted more mobs to get wool.  I've multiple posts about how great the AQ event was and it brought the community together.  I remember more bitching from people because of the AQ event than almost anything else during vanilla except maybe Naxx server stability.

People have bitched about this kind of shit before and they will always bitch about this shit.  Anything that is inconvenient is going to make this mad.  This isn't a new problem.  None of this is a new problem.  People will always bitch about the new inconvenience.
---
(Insert number of years) and people are still bitching
---
repair bots are not cheap to make though :(
---
That would’ve been better for me before I made my hide of the Wild lately. Meanwhile golden pearls are now up to almost 60G/each on my server: Fairbanks
---
yea, basically blizzard said "we are working on it" lol
---
Oh ok, now I see what you're saying.
---
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!
---
I would like to know this too
---
This is the correct response
---
I made my point.  Blizzard is at fault for the mess
---
You said it was ok that it's a mess because blizzard announced the plan ahead of time
---
I pointed out how dumb that logic was.
---
Now you are floundering
---
You can use them to ranged pull but that's it. Hunter is the only class that can really use them to deal damage.

If you're horde, go from kargath. It's much easier. Alliance tends to use the south entrance and that seems to work for them.
---
Honestly this. Everyone should be attack on sight. Kill them before they can kill you. Assert your dominance so they leave your area.
---
Damn it, Uther! As your future king, I order you to purge this city!
---
Cross faction collusion to control the distribution of some of the best weapons in the game.

“Why don’t you try fucking yourself”-Blizzard
---
[It's literally against the rules](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-general/2336291.htm). Just because people have been doing it for years doesn't make it okay.
---
No changes
---
AGREED
---
You say that, but 2 rogues in Kargath yesterday spent 2 hours respawning, popping FAP and limited invul pot, to get one kill and die again.
---
Is the rogue experience only fun when making others lives miserable?
---
I thought torture was more of a warlock thing. :P
---
No joke, though, I have been trying to get a mara group going for the past few days with no luck. I just want these 7-8 quests out of my quest log, but not abandoned because I don't want to do them later. 
---
It'd easily get me to 52 after both clearing the dungeon and turning these all in...
---
The warning was playing the game prior enough to anticipate these things, see? Sorry if you were a new player and didn't understand this is a possible consequence of rolling PvP.
---
The writing was right there on the wall.
---
I should add, your race matters a lot. If you are a human, you don't ever want to be using axes. Just maces/swords. If you are orc, you only want axes. If you are anything else, you want edgemaster's handguards and axes, daggers, or swords.
---
Details there kind of matter.  I cringe at a boomkin taking any of that from mages.
---
You don't need to be a marketing or customer support genius to figure things out. 
---
Faction-specific queues with a 1-2% margin of leeway and faction-specific transfer options (high-pop faction to low-pop faction) would certainly begin to fix most of the issues. 
---
Moving up battlegrounds release would also help make PvP actually enjoyable for the non-dominant faction, and probably help take away a lot of stress from leveling players getting farmed for honor. 
---
Corpse camping leveling players to the point where a mass exodus of players is already underway is obviously bad gaming ethos and bad for the game's longevity, and anybody who can't understand that should probably spend a little more time talking to real people without a screen in front of them.
---
This isn't a perfect explanation, but essentially you only really care about slow weapon speed for attacks that use base weapon damage like whirlwind, mortal strike, overpower, etc.  Since most of your damage as a fury warrior is *not* based on weapon damage attacks, weapon speed is less critical for fury than it would be for Arms - bloodthirst, for example, is based entirely around attack power.  You definitely should look into the spreadsheet like u/MotorTeacup suggested, however. 
---
TL;DR use Quel'Serrar.  14 weapon dps is more important that a .9 swing speed difference.
---
Yeah, Ally controlled one contested zone out of how many?  I'm almost positive if I park an Ally toon on your server in a 48+ zone I'd hear incessant whining about the population imbalance.
---
I'm not saying the population information is 100% correct, but it gives you a pretty good idea of the ratio of horde to alliance with a decent margin of error.
---
:(
---
What part of that says anything about stealth, dip?
---
As SM ruin are you getting a corruption slot for nightfall procs? if not you should probably switch to DS/RUIN. Your rotation should literally just be Curse(whichever you're assigned),Corruption,Shadow Bolt. reapply corruption/curse as needed. You generally only Shadowburn if the mob will die before your shadow bolt will finish its cast/travel time. 
---
If you're not getting a corruption slot you're pretty much just gonna apply your curse and then spam shadowbolt, using shadowburn when you're not going to have enough time to finish a shadowbolt cast.
---
They can in theory, they just stopped ages ago.
---
I would wait for mid-20's as you will have blizzard, hopefully better gear, and more talents. You should spec for it, just google it. It does take some coordination pre-40 because you can die very easily (you have a ton of mobs trying to kill you, one false move and you're dead).  Again, just goggle it, there's a lot of good info.  Going for a single target spec is more new player friendly.
---
It's just easier for some 🤷‍♂️😏😁
---
I like meth
---
I take anything that's an upgrade. I don't find hoarding dkp a good strategy. I don't have the mageblade (rod of ogre magi) and i top dps most fights
---
10 haunting photos taking moments before disaster.
---
Understandable. Suggest you give it another shot when BGS come out. There will be 1/10th the amount of players ganking in the world and bgs are the best content in wow
---
I didn't expect the servers to be housing 10x the players, that's for sure. But I was deeply concerned when they announced, what, 13 servers total? Yeah. Not good.
---
Just go Soul Link.
---
The fact anyone calls this real PvP is laughable.  Its like letting high school football teams play college teams and calling it competing.
---
there's other solutions, allow one way faction specific transfers or they could allow race changes to the opposite faction. not perfect solutions but better than killing faction balance completely like you short-sighted people want to do.
---
It's a really tough matchup. Especially if he's SL and just starts with vw sac and insta-resummon.
---
You build 0 rage while he just dots you to death, don't even need fear.
---
Female night elf holy priest. 26 year old male.
---
Break the fear...you are a warrior
---
How is it shitty of them? If they're playing within the rules of the game, what's wrong with camping somebody of the opposite faction?  It's a pvp server, everybody who chose to roll pvp consented to getting camped by any number of people any number of levels higher than them. 
---
Yes, it sucks when you spend 4 hours in a queue then immediately get stuck spending 30 minutes just trying to get to the boat or zep. If it ruins the game for you then switch to a pve server. Rolling pvp is you consenting for every type of pvp, not just the type of pvp you want.
---
An irl friend was another officer there so I joined his guild.
---
When the paladin took his MS tokens I said fine. Then he started taking tokens for his offspec, with the explanation that they didn't know if they could "trust" the raiding core because the guild was new.
---
I was 14, on summer vacation and playing 12+ hours a day. I had pretty much 100% raid attendance and was one of the best dps in the guild and an officer was an irl friend. I was probably the most reliable raider in the guild.
---
A few weeks later I left the guild and the raid leader /w'd me and told me it was a really shitty move to take the gear and ditch the guild. Yeah... 
---
I joined a pretty good guild where everyone was geared to the teeth so I got my full upgraded tier in like 2 weeks after that, so happy ending I guess.
---
It’s going to be hard at lower levels, I didn’t start aoe farming until around 35-40 because it wasn’t for me. You do need to spec for it because you need imp blizzard and a few other talents. There’s also a little bit of a learning curve. Definitely want to start picking up gear that’s high stam/int (of the eagle I think). Also be prepared to be very bored.
---
Judging by your reddit history in a few scrolls, you seem to do this often.
---
My lunch breaks over, take care.
---
Sure about that one? Can’t cast while silenced and Ice block is a spell cast. I could be wrong and missing out on an aspect of one of my biggest abilities
---
8k honor rank 3. Is my server easy??
---
And jumping!
---
How do you know who has what honor?
---
You dont see how that doesn't make sense? If you take someone good at the game, thats never ganked lowbies ever before, but if they do it just once for shits and giggles they dont all of a sudden become bad at the game. Moral and ethical decisions do not alter ones skill level.
---
Thems the dkp rules everyone accepted, I chose how to spend it. No one complained. Go complain somewhere else
---
Probably, I didn't think about it - I was just using it to mean killing in this context.
---
Tired of all these people complaining y'all sound like a bunch of bithes. Play the game or log off entirely
---
How bad is the leveling situation on RP-PVP servers at the moment? I am almost lv40 and I really wouldn't like to get honored-farmed when I am just trying to level. I don't mind some PvP but I have heard that the leveling experience is horrible atm on PvP server.
---
Realizing something is fun is fine.
---
Making 300 posts saying exactly the same thing circlejerking over it is not fun for anyone.
---
None.
---
Play the game.
---
Literally my life
---
8k honor kurinaxx alliance i made rank 3
---
Yup I’m with ya. Before phase two I wa a farming essences of air in silithus and making around 30-40 an hour practically with my eyes closed.
---
Back in the bc/wotlk days I would mine in circles for entire afternoons listening to some good tunes. The mindless grind is part of why I love WoW. Though, at least learning the tribute run has been engaging and challenging and having it in the bag feels good
---
We wish you a merry murghhhahhr!
---
eat shit dude
---
No, I don't see, because that makes no sense.
---
About how difficult is for them to conjure up some water once a raid night for likely 5-6 people (assuming a normal distribution of mages)
---
They have it so hard
---
Pretty amazing how many people rolled on a pvp server thinking "yeah I got this" then they realized they didn't. 
---
For us slightly more addicted to pvp, this is one of the best periods of time in wow history, live and p serves combined. 
---
Once bgs come out,  people will complain about que times,  horde still gank squading and the mass amount of afk alliance in losing pug bgs. Mark my words. Enjoy this time while it lasts cause it gets way worse once bgs come out.
---

---
msg floridaman in game if u want to join the guild, we exist to create disorder
---
My guild (also horde kromcrush) has avoided this very issue successfully by not attempting to kill any world bosses yet. Hope this helps.
---
I think you might want to look at what your options are for servers transfers and then go to those server specific forums to see if you can maybe find a guild that Raids on weekends so you aren't missing out on that part of the game also.
---
99% of people are having a blast in P2. I could never play WoW on a pve server, I’d rather quit.
---
Super mature response haha. 
---
I don't really have a pony in this circus. I'm Horde but on a smaller, relatively faction-balanced server. So if Blizz did put queues in I'd still not have to deal with waiting. It doesn't personally affect me, but I feel bad for people who can't quest because they're constantly outnumbered and farmed. But faction queues won't happen, and even if they did, they won't help. Some people need to think outside the box. 
---
Or not. Like I said, my guild and I are set either way.
---
Right, I am being melodramatic saying that people are quitting the pace in record numbers even though the data shows that... Your attitude of "I am just playing the game how I want to, so fuck literally everyone else in the game anyway. I hope everyone leaves so I have my own server to myself" is what is childish and pathetic.  I don't know how you expect to hit Rank 14 on an empty server though.
---
Same faction you dumbo
---
And that's the thing. What level are you? The higher you go, and eventually when you hit 60, for single-target damage as feral you will have to put in the extra work/effort in order to come close to equal to other geared dps classes. You can sub in just fine for the most part in most situations as long as AoE isn't a requirement(watch out for that BRD torch room!).
---
As you start moving more and more closer into raid content, the further and further the other classes start to pull away from you. As their raid set items and weapons start becoming acquired, yours won't. Some of your BiS require PvP rank 13, and for various other items you would be rolling against the others in MC, although getting to raid as feral would be another exercise in itself, being that all the druid set gear that drops is geared towards caster/resto. While being a druid works to your benefit in some aspects(there's fewer of us around in general), it also means you'll be far more likely expected to either tank(in which case gearing up for bear is very different from cat), or heal(far more likely).
---
You'll be farming *a lot* of Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomeregan...which has on-use charges. All that said, enjoy the time now while you can. Things'll change as you get higher and higher, and there's more demand for tanks/healers.

How about you try sucking on a bag of dicks instead? :)
---
Hey now, let’s not rule out those moving things that give no honor too.
---
I'd say those who stay raid spec the whole time are a vast, vast majority.
---
Not necessarily no. Powershifting is providing the biggest dps Increase, MCP providing you the additional 10/15%. It’s even less important if you powershift as your overall dps is going to be attributed more to yellow attack than white attack.
---
The cycle however is not as simple as spamming frostbolt, therefore might be difficult on some fights
---
Nah, it's much easier if you have an opposing guild to help out.
---
200k, try 2.5 million a week
---
We are literally in a thread about the spy addon. And it is a conspiracy theory that Spy lets you target stealthed people with the push of a button.
---
lol- currently 59 druid and was in scholo tanking at 57 - strats/dm at 58 and honestly - cant believe i ever waited for these dungeons until 60 in previous vanilla experiences
---
I'd prefer the alliance symbol
---
Find the spots people don’t use to travel by or through. The plague lands actually have some decent nooks you can find. Pull mobs and fight with your back up against objects like trees or hillsides.
---
Discord makes tjings way more easier to keep track of
---
I think spy should be removed.  I also didn’t say it was exactly how it was in vanilla.
---
Not caring how the other player feels, that hasn't walked 2 steps before being killed 15 times in a row, is sociopathic. 
---
If your just killing and happen upon a person, yea, game on. If you track that person and make it your life's mission to hurt them, that's a completely different story. It's being missed that some of these players are intentionally trying to break the wills of others.
---
Endlessly murdering pixels does not make you a sociopath, sure. Pixels don't feel anything though. 
---
In any case I'd rather these people get thier jollies out camping someone in a game than planning on hurting someone, or lots of someone's, for real.
---
Every post the last 2 weeks:
---
-	layering gone - servers lag - Russians can host better servers 
---
-	I get killed in world pvp

-	Horde Bad Alliance Good
---
It’s a bloodbath
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
What is the dmg difference when you equip them? If it’s not huge, then i would pick wuel serrar since it’s faster and will give you more rage, and plus it’s enchanted. If i were you, I would use quel serrar main hand and mirah’s song off hand, if u don’t already have mirah’s song, go get it, easy quest reward, it’s better than dal rend, dal rend off hand is only good when you have main hand as well, otherwise its stats are useless for fury.
---
I'm surprised you don't have a bunch of trolls telling you to git gud. Sulfuras seems fairly balanced for the most part. It's a pain in the ass to get to BRM but for the most part you got a 50/50 shot of surviving when you land at a FP.
---
forgot in 2019 you aren't allowed to bitch when someone does a shitty job.
---
Everytime you do this some idiot throws you a heal despite it being "wipe it up"
---
Though the pro healers throw you a heal to troll you
---
Are more details necessary? I asked for item priority and whether saving dkp was advisable.
---
Simply saying: respec (if not mage) or /gquit if mage and mageblade is reserved doesn’t answer the question.
---
Yup, because no Alliance race has *ever* had a racial trait that was OP.  🙄
---
You would be correct on the breaking of wills....
---
There was a saying in the days of vanilla...
---
Fight/reroll or quit. 
---
They dont care, they just want you to foght/reroll or quit.
---
I cringe at boomkins in raids period.
---
Right now Blackrock Mountain serves as the BG for PVP servers.
---
Got it at the FP last night. I landed and was immediately locked up in stuns.
---
You completely missed the point but ok.
---
As a mage, you're not wrong. Mages have the best total package when it comes to CC. Poly is great, everything they do roots or slows. 
---
But in terms of individual Crowd Control effects, Fear is stronger than Poly since Fear won't always break with damage, especially DoTs, and Fear also doesn't heal your target.
---
Maybe add a popup (or a button) when opening bank?
---
So in one post, you:
---
1) Boasted about killing level 50 allies using your fully raid geared level 60 mage on an epic mount.  
---
2) Refusing to fight same level opponents because they beat you.  
---
3) Corpse camping flight paths to take out low level characters who don't have the ability to turn their gryphon around.
---
I'm \*assuming\* that you're just trolling with this post and are not in fact a complete loser? Seriously. You've giving Horde a bad name here, mate. Awfully glad I rolled on a PVE server so I can avoid this sheer stupidity. I've experienced enough 'open world PVP' in the past to know that what you're describing above is in fact the norm, not the exception.
---
Winds howling
---
If your alt has lead when its logged off it auto shifts to your main after some time. You can’t pass lead back to your alt while its offline. It’s easier to just invite someone, logout and have them reset.
---
Curse of shadows/elements and shadowbolts. If you’re lucky, the raid lead will let you use corruption to proc more shadowbolts. Your dps won’t really improve until you get gear from later raids and spec into DS/Ruin.

---
OK
---
They not caring about something as mission critical as faction balance gives me zero faith in their ability to not push Classic into the fire.
---
Over the last \~2 weeks, I've gone full #nochanges.  I just dont trust them.  They few decisions they had to make (# of servers on launch, not capping signups etc), where a total train wreck.
---
 I do have to complement them on layering though.  It was/is a great idea.  They just screwed it up again but not having a long cooldown on layer switching (the mechanic got exploited and once again, Blizz dropped the ball).
---
Depends on your rank, its on a curve, from no rank you can get rank 4 in a week, rank 6 the next week, maybe rank 8 the week after and then it really starts to slow down
---
The best is when it's 1 min from CD so you just pop it again when you rez
---
You can walk around as a ghost to check for stealthed enemies
---
Smort.
---
Agreed on all points. Im leveling with a 0/21/30 build and keeping threat on my pet is tough. Those levels where your growl is underranked are the worst. I end up having to purposefully deal a little less damage in my roto for certain mobs. Frequent use of mend pet, frequent reliance on wing clip and FD. 
---
I am wondering, though... If you go full BM spec and dont take aimed shot is a faster bow speed that big of a deal at all? Dont have to worry about clipping and I feel like a faster bow speed is actually better for kiting.
---
Would you not be upset that today you are supposed to receive a rank and don't? I'm not only annoyed, I'm a little worried that they did the honor calculation and anyone who didn't receive one wasn't part of week 1's calculation at all. It is well within the realm of reason to say "Hey, this should have been ironed out earlier"
---
Hell yeah
---
There is literally dozens of things blizzard could've done to **prevent** faction inbalance. There is almost nothing to be done now, other than 'changes' like allowing faction transfers, and a reward for doing so, etc. Even if you made the ratio on all pvp servers the same, they'd all be like 40:60 horde favored.
---
The solution I think would be best is to add faction based queues to be able to even out the online population at any given time. Incentives all the right things and only “punishes” people that would complain about not getting to dominate a faction which idk boo hoo.
---
It was an issue several weeks prior to honor. Mostly by the same group(s) of people, but it has definitely been an issue even before there was honor. It's just that now it has been exacerbated because there's a lot more groups doing it.
---
Welcome to P2!
---
You do realize it takes more time to get over there and get a team together than probably 30 minutes right? Unless he has this stuff setup for as soon as he logs on, it takes more time than you think.
---
There is not direct quote for me stating I think world pvp is a mess. Nice try.
---
Either way I have been telling you the last few replies that I do not thinking world pvp is a mess and I am enjoying it as it is right now. So this is my opinion on the matter, regardless of whatever past comment I made that is being misunderstood by you.
---
Now, is there anything you actually wanted to add or are you finished?
---
&gt;arcanist robes
---

Dkp is different ofc. Sorry then
---
My next fishing recipe is mithrilfish (dont know the exact Name) and it's cooking 175,but im just 154 so I need the lion meat for using fish again.. Or Do you know a recipe for fish for 150 skill lvl?
---
You don't use Deadly poison in pvp, huge no-no unless of course you want to be bad. Then by all means deadly poison away. Instant main, crippling off. This is in regards to 1v1 or world pvp. For casters you can use Mind numbing, I just find crippling much more effective for all around situations.
---
They are not there just to wave people.
---
I got lucky and got the boots first run, then the trinket on my second run.
---
Came into comments to do this, thanks for taking the time
---
were you not aware that servers had DOUBLE the capacity at a minimum the vanilla servers had?
---
I use it. You can have it so it only displays when someone is talking.
---
Sure, but the same size should be large enough to give us a good picture of the overall internal demographics.  The wowhead census was posted a billion times back in September and it's just a good search away.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
I mean, that's just straight up cheating dude. I don't even play Classic anymore, but an addon that literally seeks through an inhuman amount of combat logs and tells you about it, when the spy class if basically balanced to NOT have this happen, is cheating.
---
Mana issues, resist issues when AQ comes out.
---
Get a warlock to summon you in instance. Hearth repair and then accept summon.
---
Are they hacking to get on the roof? If not it shouldn't be banable. If it's an jumping glitch to get up, patch it. Makes no sense to ban people for blizzard not patching jump glitches.
---
I'd be semi-fine with that, yeah it'd be annoying but at least they'd get some Honor from it, but the last three times I died coming in from a flight path (WPL, EPL, and Burning Steppes, in that order) I was killed literally instantly.
---
I’ve been glad 2 times in bfa, never once did we have to oom a healer, you just have to get a strong cc chain going, games end quick if you know what you’re doing.
---
I rolled gnome rogue for purely rp reasons, I played Diablo 3 where there is a set of daggers called slanderer and little rogue, so I always make a little rogue named slanderer in WoW. :)
---
Nope, gotta deal with it, man.
---
I'd gladly take a PvP to PvE server transfer. But rerolling another 60 on PvE server is too much of a time investment for me. There's other games out there besides Classic.
---
I stopped playing before Phase 2 released, so this isn't strictly about the current state of WPVP which I haven't personally experienced.
---
Just addressing the whole "reroll on PvE" sounds like straight insanity to me considering how long it takes and the abundance of quality games available besides Classic. I understand for more "hardcore" players that made WoW a lifestyle, leveling to 60 is a joke. But for me it took forever and I'd much rather just play a different game instead of rerolling.
---
Offer PvP to PvE transfers and I'd renew my subscription and still play WoW Classic. But between quitting and rerolling from 1-60, quitting is the obvious choice for me.
---
&gt;	That people are inherent violent creatures?
---
It’s not really inherent if you reward and incentivize violence, or pvp in this case.
---
I've gone to Hillsbrad at least 3 times to gank (late at night when the huge war isn't going on).
---
But every time I go there, I can't bring myself to kill the lowbies. I follow them around and help them kill their mobs :3
---
But it’s not relevant of the time needed to get PvP rank. It’s just confusing to throw this kind of numbers in the discussion.
---
And yes I don’t doubt it’s easy to hardcore people to get rank 10 but if you don’t state it that you’re a hardcore player while telling how easy it is, normal people get the impression that it’s not a lot of work.
---
Yeah but why not just swap to travel form? if feline swiftness worked indoors I would 100% keep it, It also doesnt work like you would think in stealth, in stealth with feline swiftness I still drop to 84% MS
---
If there are less alliance or horde on a server and they continue to leave if im gaining honor the chances i get a higher rank go up with less people?
---
I would go with ring of sp since you probably need 2 of them
---
boomkins can't use swords.
---
It was still bad. Worse even, since there was no layering at any point. Can you imagine a Barrens where you can't be out of sight of other players at any point?
---
*Game as feature*
---
Blizzard:Dont do that. We're too lazy to fix it
---
Mhh yea. That would be a possible solution. I'll keep that in mind.
---
&gt;Are there any potions or scrolls or other consumables that I could get off the AH that would help me?  
---
If you really wanna fork over the coin, (greater) fire protection potions, (greater) shadow protection potions. You can pop a shadow one, wait 2m, pop a fire one, wait 2m, then have the shadow one off cooldown again for when the duel is in progress. You'll probably take no damage.
---
Watching horde players tryin to get on the roof was a straight up scene from world war Z
---
If there any evidence that horde players like to queue for bgs at a higher rate?
---
Why are you bullshitting yourself, mate?

The frostbolt slow will last 10 seconds, and the Mage will either nuke you if he’s geared or just sheep you and wait it out.
---
AFAIK only the Staff isn’t BiS until phase 5.
---
PORTALS
---
As a warrior shadowmeld is great.
---
Fight 1 mob, eat, meld, pray.
---
Would you say it's relatively balanced? I'm really sick of seeing Skeram be the beaten dog of Classic. I'm afraid that the server will end up dead or 95% horde. I just want to play on a server where everyone is happy, regardless of faction. Does horde or alliance have the upper hand or would you say it's about even?
---
I've done just over 400 Arena/Anger run for SGC and entice healers by either 1) adding golem and reserving 2nd Wind for them or 2) giving them all non-"reserved" gear.  
---
Didnt see SGC once in those runs.   
---
Finished up leveling dualboxed priest.  
---
The first run I do of BRD on priest solo for quests, SGC drops.  
---
Now dualboxing arena, doing about 20-25 runs a day (up to about 500 clears now).  
---
I hate BRD arena.
---
That’s nice! Where’s it from?
---
During classic I never fished or cooked.  This time around I leveled both.  I have to say that as of right now in early P2, fishing and cooking have been exaggerated in usefulness.  They're useful while leveling to cook your own food (but you're  a mage and can conjure food/drink).  If I was in a hardcore raid setting and I needed every single buff imaginable, then I can see how cooking and fishing would be useful.  As of now, I don't really care to waste my scarce playing time farming up the materials for 10 minute food buffs.  
---
P.S. I will get flamed for this opinion.
---
That part was directed at the people the if statement applied to, not directly to you as you're not somebody it bothers.  I guess it is shitty if somebody is doing it with the mindset of "I'm going to ruin this guy's day" but most of the people I know that do things like "griefing" somebody just subscribe to the "if it's red it's dead" school of thought and are generally only in a lowbie zone protecting their guildies or faction mates.  Back in vanilla I would at times park my main in the zone my alt was leveling in and if questing progress was grinding to a halt due to a 60 lowbie hunting I would switch to my main and have fun returning the favor.  It's why I rolled pvp again this time around even though a pve server would fit my schedule/ability to play now.  I leveled a druid to 60 in right around 7 days played on the rare alliance skewed PVP server, managed to hit 60 the day before phase 2 launch. I know most people are playing way more casually than that but I generally find the people that complain about this type of thing are people that take the game fairly seriously and are mad about not being able to progress at the rate they want instead of accepting it as part of the game they signed up for.
---
I am assuming it is the exact same as Tribute chests. If you can get to the box and take the item it is yours, regardless of other factors.
---
You should have done combat. You get all the tools you need to solo 3 mobs. Stop sucking, really.
---
There's 6000+ unique level 60 horde on my realm minimum. In vanilla there were 500-1000 alliance level 60s maximum. 
---
Any chance 6x the amount of level 60s, all with 2019 level knowledge and game play is a bit more intense for alliance to face?
---
Yep, I leveled a mage to 25 as well and got bored with it. Im doing a warrior now on a different server. I think this is the one!
---
Thats something i'd love to watch from the sidelines in a modern MMO. Imagine the streamer rage!
---
Middle of nowhere? Did you mean to type "right in the middle of the zone"?
---
- Feralas
---
  - Horde hub right in the middle of the zone
---
  - Alliance hub on an island with the worst boat path in the game (swimming is almost always faster)
---
- Stranglethorn Vale
---
  - Horde hub right in the middle of the zone with a flight AND zeppelin path
---
  - Alliance hub in a remote corner in the north with no guards or flight path
---
- Swamp of Sorrows
---
  - Horde guarded hub pretty much in the middle
---
  - Alliance literally have nothing
---
- Felwood
---
  - Horde flight path right in the middle of the zone
---
  - Alliance flight path in a remote location far to the north, a 2 minute run from the Moonglade FP so almost worthless
---
- Badlands
---
  - As a rare exception the Horde hub is in a corner, but it's conveniently close to the elementals required for a quest chain making them pretty much Horde only on PvP servers
---
  - Alliance get nothing
---
It's pretty clear Alliance get screwed over in every single non-neutral high level area in the game, except for maybe the Hinterlands. But even there we have to deal with the escort quest going directly towards the Horde base, so I guess it evens out.
---
So this is something worth talking about.  If you open 5 servers and allow sign ups, and all of them say "only open to sign ups if you are Alliance", then your game has a fundamentally different problem.  
---
However, is STRONGLY believe horde vs alliance numbers overall are actually pretty darn close.  When I looked at retail a while back, I believe it was something like 51% / 49%.  It was pretty evenly split (meaning, if you put everyone person on the same server, the H vs A ration would be evenly split).  
---
It's just on the individual servers where the concentrations are different, which screws up balance.  
---
Trying to control this seems like a total no brainer to me.
---
Kirtonos?
---
And because you're of that mindset your actions will make other people play the same way...and on it goes. People taking the moral high ground and not just living by 'red is dead' only have themselves to blame.
---
I once killed a Warlock who sat there waiting for me to leave to pop their Soul Stone.
---
I used my hearthstone, and canceled the spell cast at around the 9th second, and then used Shadowmeld.
---
They instantly used their soul stone and so anyway I started blasting.
---
Warlocks were really bad at pvp in early Vanilla.  Then they got death coil.
---
Theres people having trouble questing?
---
Paladins have salv as the big game breaking thing, and it peaks in BWL.  Poison cleansing and NR totem are pretty big deals in AQ, and by AQ chain heal really starts to shine.  Shaman significantly outpace paladins in healing output.  Having a shit ton of mana matters less when you can't use it fast enough to deal with damage.
---
We'll see what happens with BGs, but it was always stupid to release the Honor system with BGs.
---
gonna take this as a serious post
---
- iron grenades from engineering
---
- berserker rage to break fear
---
- health potions
---
- sapper charges if you wanna get real cheese
---
You need to play almost 12 hours a day for r11-12. 15-18 hours a day is more plausible for bracket 1 before BGs.  Battlegrounds reduce this because instead of it being a complete function of time invested, skill is actually a variable.  If you run an insane premade, it is very common to run a 5 day schedule where you premade maybe 10-12 hours a day for 5 days and then take the last 2 days off. This also gives you wiggle room to push more honor if some other premade is pushing close to your honor, or the premade that you agreed to share bracket 1 slots with decides to ninja hard push the bracket.
---
My input in this chain has zero to do with targeting stealth, and I'm sorry you failed to follow the conversation. I've used Spy since 2010 and am well aware of what it can and cannot do.
---
The click targeting to grab people instantly above you on cliffs, behind walls, below you in crypts -- this is the problem.
---
Yeah death coil is broken, but I don’t understand the mushroom part
---
I don't understand the pleasure people get from wasting another person's time.
---
The problem is that the elementals, which are recommended, are immune to nature dmg and I'm an ele shaman
---
What a terrible idea. This is literally the chinese social rating system.
---
You're going to need to do that for weeks to get rank 10.
---
This is exactly it, you can avoid it by rolling PvE, then turn your pvp on. If you are on a PvP server complaining about PvP, camping etc...that’s a you problem.
---
No I stayed and tagged every single ele I could until some allies came round, I let them kill him, then they killed me, then we fought for a bit, and he ended up leaving
---
My first go around during the open world honor system was on a paly. Pre ret "buff, if that's what you can even call ret LOL. I came into classic on a warrior knowing I'm killing everything that moves without any regard to level, quests, etc.
---
Hi dad
---
At which point most of the crazy griefing will hopefully end.
---
Zug Zug
---
We have swiftmend now.
---
Came here to say this but about fishing as well. Both can be great money makers as well.
---
most of them pretty much favor Alliance, but the great part of that is that server balance doesn't really matter on PvE servers except for economy. 
---
So Azuresong is pretty weighted for Alliance, but Horde aren't that far off. The alliance economy is kind of all over the place... Epic items are either cheap or astronomically expensive depending on who is selling it because there usually isn't more than a couple on the AH at any given time. 
---
On the other hand that means there isn't a constant supply of trade materials like Righteous Orbs which mean that you can keep checking for when they sell out on the AH and then set your own price and have 0 competition.
---
You seem quite bitter. Are u ok? I can offer you some online therapy sessions if you want, i am qualified.
---
Well said. PVP and RPPVP will remain a far spicier and more interesting way to play the game. Forces social cohesion in the face of onslaught
---
Orc rogues now have trinket to remove fear so.. good luck
---
(And undead can clear fear twice)
---
Yes! Thank you
---
\*queue dramatic music\*

*Onyxia Using her massive wings and back legs to close the distance between the lone warlock and herself in mere moments. Rushing towards him with an almost delighted prance. She has won.

---
"*LEARN YOUR PLACE MORTAL!*"
---
OP is obviously sarcastic, but your post look like very serious posts of many people, so the confusion is easy to make
---
The damage difference is 171-214 with QS equipped (96.1 dps) and 203-271 with Rivenspike (81.7 dps).
---
Thanks for the input :)
---
&gt; Oh yeah I forgot to mention i got downvoted to hell
---
Sounds like the voting system is working as intended.
---
On Herod, just finished leveling in Dustwallow, spent a good amount of time outside of Ony's lair. Any alliance that wanted to could have entered at any time.
---
Thank you for the input :)
---
You can reduce Golem extra effort to a minimum. You only need to clear the golem/gnome pack immediately to the left of the boss room and you can skip the elementals at the entrance to the gnome room.
---
It's literally 1 pack of mobs and the boss. Easily worth it imo.
---
People won’t be popping FAPs every fight when they have to pay for them
---
&gt; l balance for Classic is / was (I say was, probably alot of alliance have been driven off now) about 50/50, but like 65% of horde are on PvP servers, and 65% of alliance are on PvE / RP servers - Which means you'll never get balance on PvP servers, and it doesn't matter as much on the other types, which will never get balance either.
---
Do you have a source?  I'd like to review those numbers.
---
I check this website (I know its been around for years).  I pasted the data into a spreadsheet:
---
https://realmpop.com/us.html
---
Total alliance toons = 26,371,400
---
Total horde toons = 26,789,824
---
I mean, thats basically an even split.  Please post your source.
---
Little late to the party... OP originally said they can get up there by "using a combination of invisible wall jumps and fears"
---
Does not sound very accessible through normal use of game mechanics which is exactly what it is an exploit. If a character can not get there using movement or abilities alone or some outside mechanic like being feared through a wall is needed it is an exploit.
---
Maybe he hails from darksouls, where a bow is a respectful way of starting a duel.
---
Pummelling any shadow spell results in the warlock only able to cast immolate and fire based AOE spells.
---
As far as I’ve been able to tell there’s no indicator. However I’ve been focussed on rotation and positioning, not his casting. Another player may be able to clarify. As long as you’re putting up shield block when it’s off cooldown you shouldn’t have to do much more. Your healers should be able to keep you up unless you are under geared or not Prot spec.
---
Id support a mix of both of these conclusions. I think people are ignorant and don't realize the honorless conditions and just kill on sight because that's what they think they should be doing. The problem is that it takes one guy in a group to start attacking the target before everyone kinda just jumps onboard and zergs the guy.
---
Are there actually people complaining about questing difficulty or is this just made up?
---
Small world. You ganked my NE warrior on Raven Hill yesterday. I brought my hunter main.
---
You as a player can sell gold for $10/100g. Epic mount tangible value:$90usd.
---
It's 15hks
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
greater shadow protection potion lol
---
Yeah, this is the most bullshit response. I like PvP servers because it's SUPPOSED to put everyone on an even playing field. If I'm on a PvE server and decide I want to PvP, then that basically lets Horde sit and stare at me until I'm in an inopportune situation, and THEN flag themselves PvP to kill me.
---
The problem is the insane imbalance between factions. PvP servers are NOT for bored ass no-lifes who suck at PvP to camp me because they can't kill people their own level. Seriously, the amount of times I've been ganked by shitty players who are just too high leveled for me to do anything is unreal.
---
If you're the Mage raiding with WC, you can absolutely use a farm spec with [Shatter, Permafreeze, and even Imp Blizz](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230001--05350233132351351). The only DPS loss in a raid environment is from going oom (a nonissue in current content with mana pots/runes) and not having the additional crit on Arcane Explosion for some AoE fights.
---
Good call - I’m a gnome, decided to not care about min maxing.
---
Just find the right guild dude..
---
Ah! Thanks. Berserker Rage is one of those abilities that I completely forget about because encountering fear while questing is very rare (in my experience).
---
You said they get nothing from it, we just established they're getting joy from it or they probably wouldn't be doing it. Why the fuck should your experience matter more than the guy doing the griefing? 
---
I don't know why you would call getting camped abusing the system. There's nothing being abused or exploited, it's an intended but in part of the game.
---
Also very good
---
Heh, I remember saying things like this in vanilla and the response I'd always get was...
---
Pvp happened.
---
Lol, I don't believe this.
---
Yeah our vision on things is biased by our own anecdotal experience, which is true for my statement too.
---
Server balance is pretty good on Grob, but it does seem that both factions don't exactly act the same ways. Of course you'll have gank squads on both sides so levelling during phase 2 is gonna be a pain for either factions, everybody wants free "honor". 
---
In my own biased experiences, I hate zerg guilds à la Final Boss or Hurricane (downvotes incoming from both groups) and I don't think that camping zones with 100+ people makes up for good PvP and I did see Hurricane and Enclave/Atlas/Martial Law do that more often than any Horde group I've heard of. 
---
I do love RP event battles between both factions or small-mid sized skirmishes. Huge props to that awesome dwarf guild.
---
Because Windfury is badass
---
100g is really underpaying for SGC. 
---
based on my small sample of ~176 2 man arena runs on my SGC grind, fair salary for healer would entail either: all blues, 20g per gorosh ID, or 200-300g on drop.
---
luckily I am multibox scum, which comes with the benefit of not having to pay off a healer, and 100% up time (can do something productive between lockouts)
---
He'd see right through that claim -- he looks just like me.
---
lmfao 😂😂😂😂
---
It's definitely not easier to click than hit a keybind.  One can be done instantly and blindly and the other cannot.  :P
---
nobody mentioning theres no durability damage from pvp deaths?
---
&gt; Faerlina is one of the easier servers to rank on
---
Not sure if I agree with this. Why do you think so? I'd say a higher proportion of tryhard rankers compared to an average server = harder to rank on. I think our pop definitely skews more towards the tryhard than the average. Maybe Herod would be the only server more tryhard in NA
---
Yes I think mostly it’s an overreaction, because of the hype of honor release you have artificially high numbers of people partaking right now.  
---
Just like at release when people were crying it’s unplayable because we couldn’t tag a single mob in any of the starter zones.  
---
The hype will quiet, the people will realize that wPvP is a very tough, futile grind, and go back to doing other things.  This is week 1 of honor and the amount of tears I see is amazing.
---
Rule number one of fishing, do not talk about how lucrative fishing can be.
---
This has been my strategy so far.
---
Yea and if they get mad, it is their own fault... Should've rolled on a PvE server. Or go To rEtAiL.
---
I beat him up every morning. I wake up at 6:00, he wakes up at 9:00.
---
You also forgot in 2019 people think their opinion is fact
---
&gt;Don't like it? Use the free server transfer provided.
---
And off to ruin another server, brilliant fix.
---
Sigh, if we put everything down as a small perspective that we should look over, nothing would happen.
---
Gonna take you 3 months of grinding daily to hope to hit rank 10+ sorry to burst your bubble
---
Racials come into play when all your races look boring as fuck.
---
If I rolled Alliance, I'd be stuck playing Dwarves. Maybe a female Nelf or female Human. Sorry your races are so boring.
---
Refer to my other response.
---
Using walljumps and fear is not "accessible" by proper use of ingame mechanics and is an exploit.
---
&gt; You as a player can sell gold for $10/100g.
---
Not within the ToS you can't. You get caught, you get banned. You get scammed, oh well.
---
Damn smolderweb last I checked are 25g each.
---
If you give people an option to transfer, I don’t think it would. Plus, people are literally posting here all the time about how they don’t want to play on a 70/30 server, where the amount of alive horde to alive alli is 5:1, and then unsubscribe. I think that’s a much bigger cause of unsubbing than a queue implemented to make the game better.
---
Ring is Bind on pickup
---
calling this gank fest pvp is like calling whack-a-mole mixed martial arts.
---
Uuuh... okay. What about people leaving the game or rerolling? Blizzard can't match the same type of players into one server.
---
Mike Tyson plays WoW? Bet he plays a Priesth
---
It didnt give stun resist in WotLK afaik.
---
Warrior Gear - Any piece of Plate, Mail, Leather or cloth that said warrior deems he needs
---
Yeah, losers enjoy that.
---
What? You don't get why people are complaining about others using exploits that are against the ToS?
---
Did this a month ago and it didnt work
---
There's no curve to watch that allows you to see the time it takes if you have never participated in the system. All you have is the words of players who participated back in the days and if most are telling "it's easy" because they are hardcore players who either don't get that they are playing hardcore or just playing tough guy then people will get the impression that it's easy.
---
I mean I had this discussion 3 months ago with someone who answered to everyone asking that it was easy. When I told him it was bullshit and it was maybe easy for him because he was an hardcore player he told me that he wasn't. A few post later I learned that he was in one of the top50 guild of Vanilla  who was raiding 6/7 but still he wouldn't accept the idea that he wasn't playing casually and his perception of time was skewed.
---
Drenai are just ugly and not in any redeemable way. Horde ugly somehow has a charm
---
Yes . Why did you even post?
---
Ironically, you are the one complaining the most. If you enjoy playing on a PvE server, good for you. Surely has left some very deep emotional wounds in you it seems though.
---
I don't see what you have to gain by bashing the PvP community which, quite honestly, couldn't care less about you.
---
An equal ratio wouldn't result in zero imbalanced fights, it would just let them be equally probable for each faction, rather than almost always being one way.
---
I think we're gonna have to agree to disagree on people enjoying the imbalance. I've yet to talk to a single player in-game who enjoys having every part of the world controlled by the opposing faction because of a 4:1, 3:1, or 2:1 ratios going on.
---
If independent queues were implemented (which will never happen) free server / faction transfers for the overpopulated side is only fair.
---
Well the first time it dropped a mage needed it and later realized it's only +healing... saw him in EPL a few days later with an empty trinket slot. Guess he vendored it to hide his shame. After that came countless runs to that boss before I saw it again.
---
2 ranks is the max you can jump and only until rank 6, then its 1 max
---
But the npcs are viable targets. Dead battlemasters= not being able to get into bgs.
---
You'll want to use berserker rage to get out of fear against priest and locks, but otherwise berserker rage can be dangerous if you're opponent is in a position to be attacking you.
---
People are not unsubbing because they are the majority faction.  Thats just fake news.
---
It's your fault for picking the more powerful faction knowing you'd help ruin the game in the process.
---
Obviously blizzard is (more) at fault here, but the horde players are _not_ innocent.
---
Here kid have an upvote! 
---
Is not everyday I see alliance tears before they bleed! 
---
Serves you right you alliance scum! I bet you are a filth gnome!
---
But you are angry like those hairy lepricons from the mountains... 
---
( Role play is the best on this stuff )
---
Why would I get upset over something that was a mistake on blizzard's end? It's a video game
---
Idk how to link posts in comments but his name was u/lolokwhateverman
---
Man, this honor thing is the funniest shit. Questing in STV is damn near impossible until I learned the secret as an alliance man.....
---
Make em laugh.
---
Everytime I start getting ganked I pop my bubble and /beg, /weep, /sigh, /golfclap. Three times now the horde attacking me have laughed, patted me on the back and moved on to some other unlucky fool questing alone.
---
I have no shame as long as it gets me to 60.
---
yet you signed up for the possibility of this exact situation happening when you joined a pvp server.
---
The Priest discord has videos about solo-farming tribute runs or the first boss of DM:N. There are also Princess runs. I'm sure if you duo'd you could do Winterspring for the Eye of Shadows.
---
You can get frozen or shadow wrath BOEs up to +30 that are quite a bit better. The +29 variants are plenty affordable and should be chosen over Omnicast.
---
&gt; It was pretty evenly split (meaning, if you put everyone person on the same server, the H vs A ratio would be evenly split).
---
This has problems because not everyone is on a pvp server.  The last census data we do have for wow put horde at about 59/41 advantage over pvp servers and Alliance around the same advantage on pve.  There were more people on PvP servers in total so at the time of the last confirmed information, there would be more total total players.
---
The issue though is splitting PvE and PvP.  You can't just add them together and the information we do have shows a pretty significant horde advantage overall across PvP servers.  There is no way to split them which doesn't result in horde having an advantage.  Either you accept some massive horde biased servers to some a couple Alliance biased and some balanced, or you give every server  horde bias.
---
The problem comes from people wanting to be horde more than alliance on pvp servers.  You have to convince them alliance is better for them.  So far people only want to punish people into alliance, which is a terrible way to balance.
---
Any good farming spot if you can play early mornings and have the place to yourself. EPL water elementals, arathi fire elementals.
---
It's not impossible.. just because you have the most one week doesnt mean u will have the most 6 weeks in a row.. people take breaks and lose ranks or grind to hard and burn out.
---
No shit? I did not know that. I'll edit. I think the rest of the point still stands though.
---
You get less bonus from haste effects like improved aspect of the hawk, rapid shot, and the troll racial. The base damage stays the same, just with faster swings, so you get a boost from the higher crits with slower attack speed weapons. But that's marginal damage at best, and situational; although you do get the attack speed increase off quivers all the time.
---
Really, I think it's totally overrated for hunters; I'd almost always take the higher base DPS weapon over a slower weapon while leveling.
---
Pro tip: Intercept.
---
Not really dead but low pop and was one of the added servers, super casual as a whole server really, maybe only 5 guilds have downed rag probably only 3 of which without pugs to fill ranks and a lot of people are still lvling or just hit 60
---
Alright then.
---
RIP Denbu
---
Also Bear/Krigs.
---
Fury is a terrible PVP spec. Worse than full Prot.
---
Alliance = Best PvE racials
---
Horde = Best PvP racials
---
I think this is the general consensus
---
So blizzard messes up and your responses to be toxic?
---
It's just random to my knowledge. Sometimes he uses it twice in a row, sometimes he doesn't use it for the entire fight. It just depends on how he's feeling that run.
---
Amazing that 15 years later "casual" is still a limp-dick attempt at an insult.
---
RATTLEGANG HORDE REPRESENT
---
anyways im just waiting it out a bit ever since phase 2 came out, doesn't matter really because my pc is mega broke
---
It was mostly to cut down on tickets people were putting in just to see a GM so staff could get to tickets. 
---
We had a few instances on a select few realms where it didn't go great. Caused more trouble than it solved. 
---
Try to solve player exploitation in a more private way as to not draw community attention as well.
---
I like 58s and 59s.  Less Elitist Jerks.  "Hey brah, you can skip that pack.  Why you tanking it there? Pull faster."
---
Wiping 40 mans on their way to their raid as 10-20 is good honor too.
---
10 sappers is pretty much enough to wipe any raid.
---
You need to get this idea of perfection out of your head and if something bothers you you need to just take a break from it
---
I say we let em do it. This is classic for god's sake, it is beautiful because of weird mechanics it allows. If ypu want enemies off the roof - call friends and MAKE THEM off that roof! 
---
So either make rooftopping legal, or go further down your filthy unclassic #somechanges road and give guards ranged weapons.
---
Thanks for the detailed advice. I'm an orc warrior, without engineering. But you gave plenty of info I can work with.
---
Horde noob question - what is the closest arrow vendor to Org AH? There’s a bullet vendor right next door, but couldn’t find arrows...
---
Ehhh, it definitely got WAY worse with honor coming out.  The difference between what I experienced finishing up leveling my Mage the Tuesday before the patch dropped and what it’s like now is absurd.
---
MP5 is incredibly important for a few classes/specs
---
People's behavior counts way more than their levels / gear. 5 mans are my favorite part of the game, so I do a shitload of them. Some of my smoothest runs have been with off-meta classes and non-60s.
---
Some of my most painfully brutal runs have been with hotheaded, geared out, impatient players who don't listen to feedback and needlessly skip or rush through shit, inevitably leading to wipes.
---
Where are you getting this 60/40 split.  Please post a credible source from RETAIL (bigger n, more history etc).
---
This is an issue when for months prior to the games launch every min-maxer is telling and being told that if you don't go Horde for PvP you're a scrub
---
No problem. Having fun starting over from level 1 on a new server lol
---
How?
---
If you want to make a UI like the video it doesn't seem like he's using much.
---
Top left is [Spy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/spy-classic)
---
Buttons by his chat log for engi items could be [AutoBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autobar-classic)
---
Party frames could be almost anything. They look pretty common, I'm sure someone else can give you a definitive answer, but you can replicate that with [VuhDo](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vuhdo/files/2825021)
---
It looks like he's using [OmniCC](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/omni-cc/files/2793925) + [ClassicAuraDurations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicauradurations) as well as [Classic CastBars](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccastbars)
---
I'm not sure what unit frames he's using to sub in the class icon for the unit portrait but it's pretty common, someone else should recognize it.
---
Trinkets is either [Trinket Menu](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24977-TrinketMenuClassic.html) or [ItemRack](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25256-ItemRackClassicQuickfix.html)

There are a lot of unit plates that look like that, try [NeatPlates](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates/files/2828688)
---
I don't know what he's using to make the border on his unit frames and action bars darker.
---
2-3g for 20.  Not too expensive.
---
I got in last night with only 9 deaths, used 2 inviz potions (stupid 10 min CD) and nifty stopwatch
---
Are you drunketh... hic!?
---
I have 12k honor 1 dhk and I'm rank 0. What's going on? Did 1 DHK really just keep me from any rank at all?
---
Wait until 10am pst. Should update then.
---
Azuresong mageblade from golemagg is bis until R14/world boss drop
---
It's even on Grob and Earthfury, two servers I play on. both from ingame experience and running the census addon, the balance is real close to 50/50. Earthfury is medium with about 450 lvl 60s / 1200 total horde at primetime, and Grob is full with at least 2.5X more players.
---
Trying to say Alliance racials are busted in pvp, meanwhile most pvp servers lean horde. My sides.
---
Multiple people will.  .1% of them will get rank 14.  The rest of the ranks no one cares about.  This has always just been a huge grind with people manipulating the rankings, that's what they did in Vanilla too.  It's not new.
---
Have you ever even played a warlock or a warrior? You’re honestly saying the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen
---
Thanks for the rotation advice. I'll give it some practice on mobs.
---
That's been my last 3 pools.  At least I have a ton of squid to sell.
---
Thats what southshire and tauren mill were made for
---
My Guild back then basically ran the PvP on the server until Botting became mainstream.
---
It was reasonable at first because everyone coordinated and said " this person is getting first in honor this week and he's going to stop at this amount.". And that amount was something reasonable that didn't require people to play 8 hours a day.
---
But it also came with the message "if you break this rule, the entire Guild is logging on, and we'll grind and win like 99% of the games and just leave you in the dust and then nobody wins".
---
That worked until AV bots that literally played 24/7 became popular and yeah, to hit rank 14 legitimately required grinding 16 hours a day.
---
That is awesome. Might have to check it out!
---
The best part about this post is this exact thing literally happened to hundreds if not thousands of people last night... You've inadvertently threatened hundreds of ?? players all at once.
---
Wiping a lone player gives more honor than lonesomely getting wiped by 40 players.
---
Sometimes stuff doesn't drop in those instances.  I'm lucky as a Paladin that Paladin gear drops frequently (at least from Rag and Ony).  I got my T2 legs and helm in my first runs, haha.  Maybe they are that way with warlock gear? /shrug  
---
He could be grinding in between raids for it.  Do you want him to just not go to the raids until he gets it?  That's a bit silly...
---
2h fury at that lvl ? why ?
---
Ask him if he has a phone! That'll get em!
---
Have the druid in a guild called „X‘s Pet“ for maximal authenticity!
---
I'm providing my experience as a counterpoint to your "horde are the ones really suffering but I'm having fun anyway!" claim which pretty strongly suggests that you have no idea what it's like for the other side. If you don't want to listen, I can't make you. But "I got killed once in Feralas, why don't you just grow up" is a catastrophically stupid thing to say when there is a raid in Menethil harbor every night camping Alliance.
---
It would depend on how expensive the potions are. And how decisively I could win compared to the cost :-)
---
Yeah like 20-50g in mats depending on the server. Not worth it for anything outside of raids or absolute emergencies, really.
---
But that's what I said. If you get 20 PER WEEK and the rest has LESS.
---
Spotted the rogue
---
Not enough Moonkin
---
Standing #1 on Faerlina had 194k honor, so you were pretty close.
---
Whoosh
---
I know his reddit name. This ain't it :-D
---
I would not respec yet.
---
You will be picking up another big axe in Maraudon (Gatorbite).
---
Have to be outside instance for summon to work, which is impossible for some of us with a certain faction camping behind the brd instance portal
---
Nice projecting there.
---
Man I feel you. I think I got picked off like 4 times last night by mages while trying to get to a fp and I kept thinking what I could be doing better.
---
I think what I’m gonna do is what someone else here mentioned and build a stam set and level my engine for those stun bombs.
---
Gnome best for pvp too.
---
Shadow reflector, the net and iron grenades are your biggest friends.
---
Ranks don't update all at once for everyone on every server.  Give it time.
---
What's fair combat? A Rogue invisibly waiting for a mage to sit down and drink at 50% health?
---
There are no rules in love and war. If you expect the other party to play fair you're only setting yourself up for frustrating defeat.
---
Iron counterweight is nice/cheap alternative, if you are full bear. 3% extra speed marginally improves threat generation.
---
Thanks. I'll research PvP trinkets.
---
You mean those random nonelite animals ?
---
&gt;People who just say Reroll/Quit fail to understand that you can enjoy PvP on the level where if you meet someone from the other faction at a resource node, you want to fight them for it. And at the same time not enjoy that the entire world is so overpopulated by roaming gank squads that it is impossible to do anything outside cities unless you move in a large group (or you play a stealth class).
---
Right...but that gaming style is available on PVE servers.
---
The reason many of us who play PVE are dismissing PVP players concerns are that PVE servers allow us to have PVP when we want it, but to be able to level when we dont.
---
PVP players knew what they were getting into and they chose that...so while I would support paid transfers and things like that...I'm also a big confused why there has been this massive outcry.  I mean...the horror stories of leveling on PVP servers in Vanilla have always been known, why would people think Classic would be different?
---
DK's are applied to your current rank (read: immediately). They are not part of an honor calculation for any daily/weekly conversion. It's most likely that you are bugged / need to force a relog for refreshed figures.
---
Wrecked
---
As a boomkin I'll take all the mp5 I can get. That's right healers I'm taking your loot.
---
Basically this on smolderweb alliance. I feel like any 50+ zone I see 10-15 alliance and 50+ horde. Don’t even get me started on black rock mountain
---
He has 232 kills unaccounted for. A clear bug. Your comment is both ignorant and toxic for no reason.
---
I love how @8:37 there are 2 minutes cut out where Neil is kicked out of the raid group, thereby destroying loot priority. Maybe if your raid leader hadn't kicked people mid fight you wouldn't have lost the loot.
---
you can watch the unedited portion [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510351865?t=00h09m30s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510351865?t=00h09m30s)
---
Blizzard ruined Skeram. Realm transfers never should have happened on Skeram, they fucked my work since I'm alliance stuck on it.
---
That is fair, but I use a mix of both.
---
Important actions are Keybound and not so important ones I click
---
Same here!
---
Enjoying the PvE leveling.  Then I will start doing raids.
---
I'll be back to my level 40 PvP guy later.  Let that all die down first.
---
That'll die off now that DKs hurt.
---
does not work.
---
Just a wasted hearth stone.
---
None,didn't update yet
---
He is referring to the time human had a pvp trinket in future expansions
---
&gt; even though he didn't successfully cast a single non-instant cast spell
---
Do you think it's fair that you can basically fight him for 2 minutes without him ever being able to cast a non instant spell? Like what'd be his recouse here if it weren't for incredible tankiness and instants? Fair = I always win because I am so good?
---
Only duel when Recklessness is up.
---
sir, this is a Wendy's
---
Man I remember my old guild in vanilla/tbc had trivia bot running basically 24/
---
Yep vanilla was pretty shitty for pvp, almost no balance, people die in 2 hits, casters severely hindered by mana pool, I'm just waiting for BC or classic+, or if retail fixes it's problems i might just raid log classic until then
---
You're right, I did. I certainly did expect to get killed a lot. But I can still be angry at the 24-7 lock down on every zone in my level range. I can say it sucks. I can be pissed that my faction is out numbered. When I have hot wings for dinner, I know theres a risk that my stomach might hurt later. I sign up for that risk. Doesn't mean I cant be irritated by the pain.
---
We aren't talking about retail so it's irrelevant
---
Is the last data before Blizzard broke the mod from being accurate.  It puts PvP servers at 57-43 in favor of the horde.
---
So, you want to change how people currently are? 
---
It’s commonly known that horde has a slight advantage with pvp racials which is a big factor in why so many people picked horde. That doesn’t seem like something that would be enough for some players to take the free server transfers. 
---
Alliance on most servers are the only ones currently punished with being locked into the server imbalance. At this trajectory, alliance will quit or reroll horde escalating the problem to the point that no one will want to play either faction. 
---
What server/faction do you play?
---
[sobbing and drinking]
---
They made updates to the stats later in Vanilla.  The original gear was out in patch 1.4 (phase 2) but the upgraded stuff wasn't until around AQ time, which is why some think it won't come until phase 5.  If Blizzard is consistent, the upgraded stats should be available now, but we won't know until someone gets Rank 6 and can go talk to the vendor in the Officer's Barracks.
---
You don't need gfpp for any raid that is out right now. Heck I end rag with my gfpp still up half the time.
---
When I left you could still do this. Sometimes the GM unstick features are real rough or you would waste an hour trying to verify something was an addons. So if it looked good when you logged in you knew for sure.
---
that's the correct approach. if you blow gold on fap, the mage will blow zero gold on coldsnap and two iceblocks and still win. no point.
---
Because I enjoy it.
---
Bloodsaid Buccaneer is balanced and tons of fun
---
So I was able to get on a call today and the game master told me the dev team already looked at my account and will not be reviewing it again. They have proof I was involved in trading a pve or pvp service for real money to some capacity. He said even if I wasnt paying for or providing the service, me being in the group makes me accountable and now I am just shit out of luck
---
I wasn't aware it was possible for alliance to kill horde players. From reading all the reddit posts I thought all alliance were killed upon login. Now here you are implying it goes both ways. What to heck??
---
My strategy is to hide in dm:e farming lashers until I get my epic mount. Then my strategy will be to run from them.
---
It works like a tribute chest, you check for the item, usually a Petrified Leaf - the buyer waits to zone in for one raid member to logout. 
---
When the buyer zones in, you loot them the leaf after they've paid for it - for us, it's normally 500-700g each week since we run 4 raids per week.
---
Thanks to this now we have a garage retail.
---
Prietht*
---
Imagine playing WoW on a PvE server. Hope you get a discounted sub since you're only experiencing half the game.
---
This is why I rolled on a PvE server, I knew this shit was going to happen and that it wouldn't be worth it.
---
No. Because when I can play, and when world pvp stops being one faction corpse camping, pvp is fun. All I'm saying, is that I am frustrated. We rolled pvp because we want to pvp. But right now, we just cant.
---
50s pays for the mat cost and nothing else. 1g is a pretty standard tip.
---
And the min/maxing culture has probably compounded the issue.  
---
But then hang on a sec.  What can be done to try and push every PVP server to a 60/40 H vs A split?  Technically these 90/10 splits shouldnt exist.
---
What tools does Blizz have in place to do this?
---
No keybinds? Wtf is wrong with you lol.
---
Very little damage moonkins do is nature.  It's almost entirely made up with Arcane damage.  You shouldn't be spamming Wrath either as its cast time gets shorter than GCD thus wasting any crits you get to speed up cast timers.  Since it has a delay in feedback for travel time, it cannot properly be utilized as a reliable trigger for Starfire to have shortened casts.  
---
Wrath only becomes useful when your taking pushback hits from mobs or other players.  
---
The whole argument about nature damage is moot and repeated by people who do not understand anything about the class.  It's a neon sign that says "I should not be commenting on this discussion but here I am."
---
the Yeti cave in the north west?  See you there.
---
I feel like a majority of the complaints I've heard can be solved but always rolling deep in a squad. I mean this is a mmo called WARcraft. One guy a couple posts up said he's quitting because he can't even pick up flowers in a video game anymore. The entire point is that it's a massive war between two factions! That's like the gimmick of wow. You expect to go into a war zone and pick flowers with no interference?
---
1 that I know of in heartseeker, and a couple that are pretty even.
---
I havnt given them a tip yet
---
Because your idea wouldn't have worked.
---
Let me explain why
---
The majority of people will start playing on day 1
---
on the southwest corner of arena, there is ledge where you can deaggro everything 
---
this means even if the low levels pull the spectators while jumping into arena you can reset them away
---
For MC and most of BWL MP5 is pretty damn bad in most cases. Fights are over so fast and so little healing is actually needed, raids have more than enough healers for them not to go oom on any fight and its not like you can even take fewer healers and then get use of mp5, since there are so many ppl to heal. 
---
Things will change once AQ and Naxx comes around, where some fights are pretty damn long and you will actually need that mana regen, but for the next few phases it is super overrated.
---
Unless you're a hunter.
---
Right, but I'm saying that was not accurate. Pagle was one of the last servers to lose layering, which blizzard said was due to their high pop. Windseeker is lower pop, but I'm pretty sure all Eastern PVE servers are high pop-full at peak. Pagle has more players than Mankrik. Even if it's lowest pop (it's not) it's still high pop, unless you're referring to the faction balance where the Horde is at a disadvantage. It's like saying a millionaire is broke because he's not a billionaire.
---
Thank you very much for the reply/info
---
Dont roam around and grind honor if you're not having fun doing it...if you wanna do things like that then go play retail.
---
Cheers
---
&gt;I'm curious if other people agree.
---
Not curious enough to use the search I guess.
---
Guild Toxic are ninjas on Kromcrush
---
I mean... there are servers you can play on without being ganked. And if you want the conditions to get better, organize! Get your guild to go on patrol, fight back. But sitting around screaming server imba accomplishes nothing.
---
could also be hoping you call in higher lvl reinforcements.
---
Right when you charge him tell him his mom was good in bed last night. That'll distract him.
---
This sums up my experience as a warrior solo questing in Stranglethorn Vale...
---
If I could transfer to a PvE server I'd do it in a heartbeat.  I just don't think I want to start over.  It was a *lot* of hours getting to 60 and everything leveled up.
---
Would this be a lucrative way for a rogue to gain some honor? I mean,  for instance, a level 60 rogue hangs around stealthed using the level 50-55 player as bait. Then when a 56-60 enemy attacks what is thought to be easy prey, the rogue counter attacks and gets the honor.
---
Yea it's crazy lol. In our raid our warlocks doing pretty well I think all have their T2 helms, might be missing 1. As far as tier 1 pieces a lot of those have dropped. Still not much of some of the other items though. 
---
Sounds like you should join our raid team o.o. And maybe I should join yours as rogue? lol.
---
hehe ;)
---
In theory.
---
This has nothing to do with PVP servers. It's same faction griefing. 
---
I had a priest heal me twice while I was doing the Hunter Rok'delar quest. Any help you receive makes it a wipe. I whispered him the first time saying "hey I appreciate you helping, but unfortunately this has to be solo'd or it kills us both"
---
His response? "I Know :)", and he did it again on my next attempt so I left.
---
I agree with this Blizzard should ban this add on this completely ruin the whole pvp experience.
---
I found some complaining...
---
The stuff coming out of the ground?
---
For an enhancement shaman at lvl 43
---
Should I wear the berserkers helm 13 str 8 stam 1% crit mail
---
or
---
Nightscape Headband 12 agi 11 stam leather
---
Similarly
---
Shining Silver Breastplate 14 str 6 stam mail
---
Nightscape Tunic 15 agi 6 stam leather
---
Tons of us 60s also have jobs, kids, careers, and life outside the game. If you're not 60byet it's either because you're the definition of a casual or just dont know how to level properly.
---
Progress update?
---
Acording to the statistics the ratio is 51/49 worldwide. So.. no?
---
It’s worth noting that them making a portal costs 20s in the first place.  If your 60 or approaching 60, I think 1g+ is fair.  If you’re lower, 50s also seems appropriate.
---
that isn't what occurred you weird troll. One 40 man raid downed the boss, a second smaller group stood by, having had a couple people who took part, and somehow ninja'd the loot.
---
Stupid trolls gonna stupid I guess.
---
Someone else suggested something like the first spec you linked, i think I will give it a try.
---
Oh you may be right I’m not totally sure
---
Yeah there's a lot of it.
---
No offence, but you don't allow shitposting which is the backbone of the good nature of a lot of subs.
---
For instance, I made a fucking fantastic [post](https://imgur.com/gallery/jqUGZ9o#) a while ago, as you can see it's absolute gold, but because that gold is shaped like a little pile of poo, it got taken down.
---
Obviously I am just using your comment about the meta of the sub changing to people whining, to whine about my non-whining post getting removed, but you have to admit that if you make sure no random, nonsensical whimsy which purely exists for the sake of it, can have a place here then that sort of person isn't going to spend much time here and in fact, you specifically create a feeling of hostility and argument simply by removing them only for being what they are.
---
For myself, when I that got removed a lot of the good humour and ''magic'' that i had attached to classic wow and therefore this sub, was directed elsewhere.
---
I understand that you didn't want to have to sort through a whole bunch of shitposts which is completely justified and I am in no way saying that there wouldn't have been lots of whining if shitposting was allowed, but I do think it would be diluted.
---
yeah 50s is too much.  I have a couple rogue friends I just mail my boxes to.  they pick them and send 'em back. a 20-25s tip should be more than enough for just clicking a button.
---
I kill greys on the very rare occasion that they ganked me when i was grey to them but then I out leveled them and happen to see them again.
---
Shoot, I leveled 55-60 in dungeons 100%.  It's much faster.  
---
Especially when you ding in the middle of a boss fight while OOM and get that 100% mana to turn the fight around, haha.
---
This is hands down the most pointless post I've seen all day LMFAO.
---
In my opinion no, but you may not hold that same opinion of me.  You should go test the water for your own anecdotal reference.
---
How would you even bot PvP? Wouldn't a live player always be more skilled than the bot at fighting?
---
lol who is stupid enough to say that.
---
You want to rank ? Having a paladin with you is better than all Horde racials combined. APES didn't go Alliance for no reason.
---
That's way easier than running around the world.
---
I don't know how loot rules work, but then again I don't know if many other people do either otherwise this post wouldn't exist. All I'm stating is there was a section of the video cut out for one reason or another, and it could help explain what happened.
---
I give 1g for full inv of water or if I needed a port. Some mages are like 30s per stack of water and I kindly tell them to fuck themselfs, and swiftly put them on the ignore list.
---
&gt;Shadowmeld is fun but only lets you get the drop of things or hide. 1% dodge isn’t much.
---
Shadowmeld is godlike on hunters, I'll leave it at that.
---
Lol @ that advertisement
---
Yes, they’re a business, the goal is to make money.
---
Complaining is what got us the shitty expansion changes over the years that made into a soulless shell of an RPG and more of a chore simulator and dungeon runner.
---
i make the BRD run daily as Alliance. it’s doable and only takes 30ish minutes when an Ally raid doesn’t roll through
---
I hear you on that.  I think i had like 15 days played when I hit 60, although I AFK'd alot, lol.  Still...it's alot of investment.  I hope they open up that option for you.
---
good to now. thanks
---
The reagents for casting portal cost 20s each before faction discount, 18s after.   You're effectively only giving them a 30s tip on top of paying for the portal rune.
---
1g is standard for mage ports. 2g will get you answers in a hurry (usually). I personally think 50s is fine esp if they're farming ports but I always do 1g/2g to get it done quick and not have any arguments
---
&gt; incomprehensible sentence
---
Sunk Cost Fallacy is a bitch.
---
Do you have recklessness yet? If you use that in combination or in series with berserker rage, I don’t see how he can beat you. Also, you are using a 2h, correct?
---
Also, set up a macro to switch between your 1h and shield and your 2h. If you shield bash his shadow spell casts, you lock him out from issuing shadow spells for 6 seconds. Switch back to your 2h with macro and gg
---
I'm hella enjoying almost every aspect of the Classic and I'm so glad to be back. Server balancing is more of a meta issue in my books. Totally fixable within the parameters of keeping Classic how it's supposed to be.
---
Poisons count as detectable buffs afaik.
---
I personally don't agree with the meme rules currently in place so I'm not the person to defend that part of the ruleset.
---
I am a part of the majority faction and am part of one of those roaming gank squads .... and I agree. 
---
The system is designed to reward us for being assholes, its not our fault. I'm quickly joining the people who think BGs need to be released early.
---
However I dont know if faction imbalance has much to do with it anymore... its just a mess everywhere whether you're outnumbered or not.
---
Well that’s not the entire reason. I just generally don’t like pvp. And PvP servers tend to have more assholes it seems. The kind of griefing and trolling people get into on pvp servers just breeds bitterness and toxicity. I mean just look at some of the comments on this post. People are savage for no reason.
---
?? I don't have fun farming consumables either, but it's something that has to be done.
---
Bless you.
---
Looks like he's in pvp gear though so makes sense to use it if he doesn't have better
---
You made me come up with the idea of a "delete my entries"-feature. This leads to an approach which might be percieved much more voluntarily by the community.

The only thing funnier than people complaining about the obvious is people complaining about the complaining.

Ok, how tho
---
I'm gonna try to reach your bud-light addled boomer brain. If you want to be competitive on low play time, literally go back to retail. Classic is for people who hated all the changes made to accommodate casuals like yourself.

Join a guild so you can group to fight the other faction?

I knew this would be like this when I choose to play on a pvp realm. I understand that you don't like this, but then you should solve this problem and  roll on a pve server...
---
Plenty of wpvp on PvE servers.  Only thing missing is the getting interrupted when you are in the middle of something so someone can get the pvp scratch.  If that's the half of the game you're talking about, that half can go fuck itself.
---
I lol'ed. Take your upvote.
---
what race? with inner focus / devouring plague im able to beat a lot of classes in a 1v1 spec'd as holy/disc.
---
I love when butt hurt Alliance literally try and blame the Horde players, FOR LITERALLY PICKING A FACTION, as the reason their PvP experience is shit.
---
It's a game, I can play whatever faction I feel like. The imbalance is NOT my fault. It's not that fucking deep guys. It's a 15year old game with a 15 year old honor system that was kind of shit back then, so it's kind of shit now. Blizz gave us "no changes" so it'll stay kinda shit. Log off for a month if it's that big of a deal. Go outside. Play a different game. Y'all act like you live in Azeroth.
---
Cool, well your totally impartial theory is wrong. Kicking someone from a raid doesn't suddenly negate master loot rules. This is a bug.
---
Even pally tier sets look better (imo)
---
Super weird what happens when people know how a game works 15 years after it's release and the game isn't the exact same as people remember it.
---
These posts about how shocked people are about the state of the game are fucking tiresome. If you didn't see this coming, this is your own fault. And to paint with  broad brush. It's people like the OP that are why retail wow is in it's current dilapidated state.
---
You do you brother, I’m more interested in having engaging and pitched battles. I’m not going to give people incentives to farm me while I’m gathering mats for weapons and armor of my own. 
---
If letting someone get their weapon means they will come back time and time again for good fights then that’s more honor and fun in the long run.
---
Honestly what’s the fun in being the favourite, underdogs are the shit. When you actually get a good raid together and stomp horde raids it’s oh so rewarding. One night got 10+ guildies to start a raid and it was the most fun I’ve had in WoW.
---
Imagine being so easily defeated...
---
THAT IS PVP. GRATS YOU LOST THE WAR.
---
Get organized or accept defeat.
---
The low levels aren’t even the problem I’m referring to, although boy is that fucked too. I mean as a 60, well-geared lock, it taking upwards of 20 deaths to reach BRD, with 5 man gank squads lining the path on both sides of the mountain, and nothing to be done but death hop. No, no one predicted or warned of such incredible server imbalance or these situations, until it was too late to leave.
---
honestly if you have this opinion, you aren't even pvp'ing and need to learn these ppl are putting in a week full of their time when Blizz has had every opportunity to test a 15 year old game, so maybe just stfu
---
I know the feeling. I was in ashenvale questing. I saw this horde shaman struggling with 3 mobs on him I'm generally a tit-for-tat player when it comes to PVP so I want to help this shaman running for his life. I pull the mobs off him, toss him a `\wave`, and beat the mobs down while he's healing up. 
---
Of course I'm beat after taking on 3 mobs. CD's gone. Voidwalker low on HP and I'm super low mana. But tbh I didn't feel that worried because obviously this shaman whos life I just saved isn't going to attack me. I was wrong. this fucker starts casting lightning bolt. My jaw dropped and I thought "surely he's targeting something else". Nope. Headed right at me. I flipped a shit. Started fighting back. Fear, Corruption, all of it. I was low on everything but I was almost beating this fucker (who was really bad at pvp btw). In the end he killed me. I had never felt such seething rage from betrayal. I soul-stoned when he thought I was dead, killed him then corpse camped him for about 30mins till he logged off.
---
Dear shaman, you are the reason I started a sticky tag of kill-on-sight-and-dont-stop-killing-till-they-log-off players. I don't know who you are but you are the scum of humanity.
---
Yess. Im so glad someone noticed this. The game should be on top.
---
kill everyone and everything. im not saying u should corpsecamp though or grief.
---
I need this
---
&gt;this isn’t the true Vanilla experience you cried for during the past years.
---
Golly, you don't say. We have some massive changes in this game, such as Scholo not being 10-mannable. 
---
&gt;Since you seem unable to watch a quick 10 minute video even with tools like x1.5/1.75 speed or 5/10 sec forward and AdBlock, I watched it for you. 
---
I also don't *want* to watch it because he's ad baiting with video duration. Even with my adblock protecting me from ads currently.
---
I fully intend to Tank or heal in the major 5 mans up to 60.  As a druid I can do the skips in stealth, and you can wear all the gear that drops by 58 unless I'm missing something. 
---
From a tanking point of view the last bosses might be difficult to hit (but this depends on the end boss, according to wowhead Baron Rivendare is 62, and Darkmaster is 61.) Consider a well played Bear, who is a bit less reliant on gear and has some hit gear already.   
---
Healing should be fine, and DPS is possibly also just fine.
---
Because real men and real PvP'rs play Horde.
---
People are doing it for BiS item rewards and the infamous blue PvP set. Most of the zerg crew ruining the game think they are going to be rank 2 or 3 after their week of wasting time in a 40 main raid camping flight paths. They will give up soon enough when they realise they need to be in BG's and doing well for 30 hours a week for months on end to get those ranks.
---
What do you even mean with this? Don’t leave footsteps behind you?
---
Of course, who could forget about bear.
---
Meh. 
---
I watch some streamers for entertainment but i dont give any of them, except a single one of them, money for it. 
---
Theres one super chill guy (unfortunately only streams in my language, which is not english) whos very mature and has a chill community, pays his mods for their work and gets rid of toxic chat trolls. Hes one of the most popular youtubers in my country. 
---
I watch streams and youtube because its honestly better entertainment than the trash you get to see on tv nowadays with the incredible high demand for scripted reality tv with poor story writing etc. Also with how many streamers/youtubers/content creators there are out and about these days, i get to choose what i want to watch, and can easily move on if i dont like a specific video/stream/content. TV, if you really want to watch it to beat time or whatever, is filled with so much stupid stuff that gets pushed down your throat, and leaves you unable to walk away or choose what you want to watch, because every channel just plays the same kind of shit.
---
You must not pvp much if you believe that. There are a few times to not use it, like if you believe youll easily win, but theres a few things. First of all, theres not much to spend gold on, secondly faps are not expensive to make and if it costing people money was a reason to not use  items, engineering nades wouldnt be used by anyone, but they are.
---
&gt;People complain way too much about the state of this game. Just be happy classic WoW is out, and you are playing.
---
Agreed. Overall the game is still fun, BUT players complaining see that blizzard did absolutely nothing to prevent such a large population and faction balance problem. Faction specific transfers in week 1-4 would have massively improved most servers. It's easy to complain when blizz had such an easy fix, but ignored all suggestions until the problem is way way worse than it should be.
---
&gt;A. rolled on a PVP server - specifically faerlina, Herod, or the other early ones. What did you honestly expect?
---
I was going to play on Herod but convinced two friend groups to swap last minute to a new realm to avoid over population. The realm was considered a joke that casuals were going to that couldn't handle Herod. That realm? Skeram. Now full and 75%+ horde. Not my fault. Poorly handled by blizz. Too few servers at launch, and they turned the max capacity of servers too high. They massively underestimated launch population, AND player retention. 
---
&gt;B. Faction Imbalances- yeah it sucks, but there’s also positives. Come BGs, alliance will have zero Qs to deal with. Also, horde has to literally HUNT for a small pack of alliance - alliance guilds on my server have been rolling 20+ deep and running around the world because they always encounter horde, thus easier to farm honor. Most horde end up in Tarren Mill because they get bored searching for alliance.
---
Cross realm bgs mean horde will have 10-15 minute queues max most likely. Not a bad price to pay for absolute control over every highly contested area on a realm. Form a group of 20? 40+ horde show up. Res and hearth? Corpse camped. Spirit res? That's camped. Fly away? Fp camped.  It's not that easy.
---
&gt;Point is, P2 has been out, and the amount of complaining is insane. Either A. Wait it out, take a break until BGs, or B. Power through. No one is forcing you to pay blizzard money and pay this game. So many people complain about the “type of PVP” - “I want city PVP and battles,  but I don’t want to be camped on boat”. 
---
I love pvp but this is not it. I'm only logging in to raid until it gets better. I still enjoy the game but I'm playing less and less. This is not good for horde or alliance. Horde will be even more honor starved as alliance log on less. This isn't a faction specific problem. Huge imbalance is bad for both factions.
---
&gt;That’s always been a part of PVP in every reiteration of classic.
---
Vanilla had 1-3k players per realm. There's over 6000 level 60 horde on my server. Not even close to comparable.
---
&gt;It happens to both Factions, and it sucks, but it’s something you have to deal with.
---
Spoken like someone who has no idea the state of the game for minority factions on 80-20 full pop realms. 
---
If you actually think it's not a big deal to be outnumbered by 5x, put your money where your mouth is and take your free xfer to heart seeker. We both know you won't.
---
Nothing was wasted lol. They always fix it. It's just the end of the world when something goes bad for you huh?
---
I agree. For many people who had not a clue what was in store for them do it. Get off my lawn so I have less competition when ranking and gathering resources.
---
Based on the last week of posts it seems like the people willing to reroll would rather play 1/2 a game vs just being a ghost and experiencing none of the game.
---
Red health bar above their name?
---
You should be able to blow away the majority of a pack with holy nova and the rest of the DPS pick off the remains afterwards, drink and move on.
---
&gt; Right...but that gaming style is available on PVE servers.
---
Well, first of all, no it's not. Only if the person taking your resource node is PvP flagged, something he probably isn't when out mining............
---
What has happened on PvP servers is a massive surge of PvP that makes all other content almost impossible to do. (This is not what happened in vanilla)
---
YOU HAVE TO BE PRESENT WHEN DOMO DIES.  Cannot bring them in after. 
---
-guy who sells leafs
---
I disagree. If the very one sided factions leave, then horde will too at some point because they will have noone to pvp with, and they will never open AQ either. Maybe faction based ques would hurt them a bit in the short term but not doing anything *will* hurt them the long term way more.
---
Because I know people and didn’t want to. I see what you’re fishing for there. The thing is I’m offering a solution that balances the shitty aspects not asking more horde to uproot guilds and leave. You’re seriously going to try and make that point when the vast majority of PVP servers are skewed in favor of the horde?
---
It would only take a tiny tiny change to completely fix that. For example, the more people that participate in an honor kill, the lower honor **that killed player is worth**. That would completely solve kill squads. For example imagine a player is worth 100 honor. If one player kills him, they get 100. If two people kill him, they get 50 each. But with this change, the player might only be worth 80 honor now, so 40 between the two. If three people killed that player, that 100 honor could bf lowered to 50, so each of the three only get 16 honor. 
---
Essentially you punish people for fighting unfair battles. That's the best solution.
---
Hahah I agree with most of it but 
---
&gt;willing to ruin someone else's good time for profit and reward.
---
They were already having a bad time. Ganking them one more time isn't changing anything. Unless they are a masochist they are having a bad time lol
---
Azure silk belt if you're not a priest/shaman, and druids in seal form likely benefit from it as well.  
---
I also use elixirs of Dream vision to scout pools faster because its run speed instead of swim speed for my paladin.
---
And it was only 1 person who was way overleveled ganking them. Not 30
---
And even then, for most classes spirit with healing rotations is much better.
---
Always take the mass downvotes for saying the truth on this subreddit because it's alliance heavy.  There's plenty of alliance zerg death squads that roam winterspring, epl, felwood, tanaris, and yes even brm is alliance occupied with 2-3 full raids quite often.  The Tarren Mill / Southshore zerg fight is often slightly in favor of alliance in numbers, too.  Just half of them sit afk in town so they end up getting pushed back and losing most of the time.
---
I don't give a shit if you got ganked 3v1 one time in stv, or happened to come through brm when the alliance don't have it occupied and had to corpse walk.  You have a home here in this subreddit to come whine about it, but the reality is that the faction population for lvl 60s is a lot closer to even ( though still more horde, but most of them are low level ). 
---
Alliance on Herod have respectable numbers and fight well often.  No reason to diminish them because you want to embrace being some kind of victim.
---
Get in where?  This is a link to just get the rank :(  Half of our server didn't update and still says rank 0
---
Rave Tauren
---
I hope you're not surprised by the fact there's roving gank squads that shut down zones, If you're not. good. :3
---
I'm not gonna be someone to go all 'hurrdurr should've rolled pve' that's stupid, because when BGs come out, the chances of there being mass scale zone lockouts might be pretty low, they might still happen.. But they won't be as big as they are now.
---
So, best of luck til then! ♥
---
The thing is they are so damn desperate for honor in the 70/30 type servers. Every last map is camped to the teeth and gank squads on every major map so no one can get anything done when all the alliance are too lazy to do any fighting back.
---
So now there are many camping boats and have rogue squads in IF to gank people. But even that I can imagine is very inefficient
---
Combat Daggers works if you have the weapons to support it. Good (enough) raid DPS and you can delete people in WPVP.
---
Yeah haha people on my level range can't get me, they always bring 60s :p
---
And a happy new rwlrwlrwlrw!
---
Do quests, or spam dungeons to do quests when you are level 60. Quests at level 60 provide more gold than they do pre-60. Furthermore, I dinged 60 with like 600g and then spammed quests. All those Arena/Anger runs in BRD have blues to vendor, and runecloth dropping. Dungeon quests alone provide a lot of gold. All of LBRS's quests are like 50-70g right there. Ditto for the Scholo / Strat quests.
---
You can skip WPL / EPL if you plan to get Exalted with Argent Dawn.
---
Seemed pretty balanced on my server. The best part was, when the call went out that Albs or Hibs were invading everyone dropped what they were doing and headed for the frontier. There was mass chaos all over the place; incredibly fun. The only thing I felt was OP was one of the Albion casters had a ranged aoe mez. That shit was broken.
---
My honor tab hasn't updated all week and still shows the first 230 hk's I got as today, I got them a week ago.
---
Well no aq40 gear for u and no honor..
---
Varies based on rarity probably, as multiple people start having it, the fair tip will go down.
---
I paid 25G tip happily for the BIS item until phase 3.
---
WoW absolutely has a disproportionately high amount of players with no social skills.
---
For me hardcore wasn't about the effort but was about the result, maybe this is how we come into disagreement. During wotlk-cata-mop days I feel like 7/7 raid schedule was a must for top 500 guilds even.
---
Ah shit who told mom..
---
Catform &gt; Stealth &gt; Slink away &gt; Pray they didn't notice you in time to AOE.
---
A friend of mine plays horde and wants to gank alliance til they quit, He doesn't give a shit about PvE, so he doesn't care if the gates never open.
---
We bring them in after Golemagg just to be precautious - but AFAIK, it works like a Tribute.
---
Any suggestions for a horde pve server?
---
If the other person on the other faction is not flagged for pvp then the option is not available on pve servers.
---
I’ve tried downloading the gatherer addon from a couple of different sources. Anyone have the link to one that will work?
---
whether you're wiping in a 5 man or not depends almost entirely on how the people are playing, and not whether they are lvl 58 or 60.
---
They should be restricting character creation for the faction that is super overpopulated until it evens out
---
I would like to lodge a complaint about your comment.
---
people doing chest farm already dont go to angerforge. Its just more efficient to farm only what you want. The strange thing is that people seem to encounter those groups in lfg which isnt the place to farm SGC.
---
I’d find a new guild if mine was fine giving talisman to a boomkin... honestly If any of the loot he “wants” went to a boomkin before the top 3-4 mages or warlock in the guild I’d find a new one. He could honestly get all those items he wants and his dps may not even break 300 lol
---
best place to farm honor is badlands where you go out to kill lvl 60 hunters trying to tame bt
---
I'm with you. If my 14 day account can't be moved to PvE then I'm gonna play/pay anymore.
---
Yeah to prevent long games, PvP outside of arena isn’t about ooming heals either, most classes have burst for these reasons. The only place I see heals drawing out fights is organized rated battlegrounds, and that’s because other healers are healing them. Normal battlegrounds it’s easy to take them down.
---
I’d say a priest in classic could easily live longer in a 2v1 than on retail.
---
Such is the price of curiosity
---
did dynasty talk to the boss then whiped? maybe it was still their tag because they talked to the boss first and that didnt reset correctly when they died. then your group talked to the boss.
---
We do it for precaution - but I’m pretty sure it works like a tribute. 
---
Obviously, someone else said it didn’t work for them, so maybe not.
---
If I see an alliance player who bit off more than they could chew I wait for them to get low and just mind blast them. It's a Mercy killing, saving them a repair bill.
---
Yes ofc.
---
Well, that's good to hear things will be back to normal.
---
Qwitcha bitchin! I chose Mankrik. I'm Horde and it's all Horde all the time. I'm happier than an Orc at Brewfest. Yeah, it's packed and I keep getting asked if I want to migrate. Hell no! Lemme alone. It's a normal server (although a lot of the players are a bit special) and I can quest at my own pace and enjoy playing more than I have in years. You don't want to be ganked don't choose a PvP server. It's really that simple.
---
Thats awesome dude, do you miss the point of his post on purpose or just actually stupid
---
Soulstone? Hah. I pop reincarnate and they come straight back. Spy addon is great!
---
&gt; Imo social scoring systems are just as bad as the people who get their hands on it.
---
I get what you're saying, but there's not really a way to only get a wow social score program into the hands of people who will use it the way it's intended.
---
Azuresong?
---
RIP Redridge tonight...
---
Naxx out?
---
I was talking about behavior mostly rofl.
---
UD rogues get a bad rap as the biggest douchebags, but orc rogues are so much worse it’s crazy to me that people still think it’s UD.
---
A UD rogue will kill you for sure, even if you are doing an escort quest or something, but after that they usually will go find someone else to kill. Orc rogues will kill you, laugh at you while teabagging, and then corpse camp you for 20 minutes.
---
It's not worth anything unless you'd run out of mana, and at the moment no fights are long enough that healers should be worrying about that.
---
When a server goes down for maintenance and comes back up, do all nodes reset? Is there a mad dash to grab thorium veins and black lotuses?
---
There is no answer to what people are seeing though...and it was entirely predictable.
---
To think that people want to seek out fair fights on PVP servers, rather than the ganking that was *very* prevalent in Vanilla PVP...is just confusing to me.
---
Sure, you're right that PVP has to be flagged for both players, but it's also more common than you'd think.
---
BM is best..sick pet, skin previous mob, run to mob, dot, auto attack, repeat... no downtime and use arcane shot/heal when needed.
---
Alliance can be happy that if you form a proper small group you can do very effective honor grinding from map to map. There’s tons of 50s around and other smaller groups. Avoid searing gorge or ss though since those tend to be 40v40.
---
I was on my horde mage and had to do the mana surges quest. It's pretty hard. There was a 42 ally mage sitting there next to Tabetha. His guild is on my KOS list but I say fuck it, I'm tired of war. I leave him and start up the quest. I watch him closely as I start trying to take on the first wave. He doesn't poly or attack me, instead, he attacks the surges!
---
Sadly a random 60 shows up and kills the mage in like 1-2 hits. I yell "NO!" at the 60 and apologize to my new mage buddy. I notice on Spy a couple ally druids are nearby. I hope that a war hasn't begun. I finish my quest and the mage resses. I point at Tabetha to tell him, I'll help you out too! He begins the quest and he tags the mobs and I help him kill them quickly. As we're finishing I notice there's two stealth ally druids ON TOP OF ME. The ally police deemed me ok and let me live.
---
Was a fun little interaction. I'm no longer killing that guild on site. I love little experiences like this.
---
Twitch app's one works.
---
It’s perfect
---
I know that most people's experience is shitty right now with faction imbalance, etc. But as someone on a 52/48 server, phase 2 has actually been fucking great. Just the right amount of danger. Granted I feel bad for those are have no reached 60, yet. I reached 60 literally the morning before honor unlocked, and it's been fantastic.
---
Preach!
---
That's why I put a freezing trap on warlock corpses. Either release or eat an aimed shot, up to you
---
Same but with mageblade. Really lucky
---
BGs will have different issues, mainly rampant queue dodging so premades only fight PUGs. Fixing dodging will be the next "one change" crusade for sure, and it will be completely justified.
---
bronze bars, nightcrawlers and coarse blasting powder, like 3 per craft or something. 150 eng to make iirc
---
I don't see how you could have fun with the extreme server imbalances that render the 50-60 bracket of leveling by and large impossible outside of dungeon farming. 
---
Why should I be punished by being forced into a playstyle or inefficient experience gain because I didn't have the time to rush to 60 like the rest of the zergs?
---
Why should any new player wishing to start the game now?
---
I don't think Blizzard thought it would be this bad either.
---
Gotta say as a warlock i almost always steer clear of warriors in 1v1. As soon as they break fear with zerg rage, intercept and hamstring it is GG for me.
---
Every. Time.
---
My heart hurts for you that it dropped when you didnt bring your main. RIP
---
Pve server alliance populations are what brings the overall population about equal for cross realm pvp. I would assume players from pvp servers are more likely to participate in battlegrounds than those from pve servers.
---
I base this only on assumptions, obviously. Only time will tell.
---
First off there was no way to know if my server is going to be equal, horde- or alliance-dominated. Second off I wanted to play an orc, I didn't even think about faction balance. Just stop it with your mindless blaming.
---
I mean, tHAT's jUsT StRaIGht up CHeaTInG DUde. I DON't EVen Play CLAsSic anYMOre, bUT AN ADDoN thaT lIterALly SEeKs thRough aN InhumAN AMOunt Of COmbat lOgS anD TELLS YOu ABoUT it, WhEn tHe SPY ClaSs is basicalLY BalaNced tO nOT HAVE THiS HaPPEN, Is chEAtiNg.
---
There's different and there's bad. One of the main strengths of life tap is that it's instant cast, which means you can dps while you stand, and life tap while you move. As Onyxia is a mobility fight, especially in phase 3, not being able to lifetap because you need the mouse to move is a huge disadvantage. Or he's keyboard turning, which would be even worse. 
---
Judging how people play in a cooperative multiplayer game is perfectly normal when bad play results in failure and time wasted.
---
I'd kill a lvl 1 gnome too
---
is Toe Knife considered bis?
---
Damn, I have 350 kills with 8k honor lol. Big groups really aren't worth it
---
its raid night, so RIP everywhere. the only truly safe place is loc modan
---
I mean I don't know what class you play but if you have AoE that right there is going to blow spriest damage out of the water when you're killing trash.
---
Single target if a spriest knows what they're doing can easily keep up with other casters in dungeons. You might've played with a bunch of shitty spriests. 
---
Also, nobody really gives a shit about dps in dungeons as long as you're not taking *forever* to kill things or causing wipes. Unless you're one of them min-maxers who's 100% about the best efficiency in every scenario. If that's the case then yeah, don't bring a spriest in your group.
---
As if horde haven't been camping BRM with three 40-man raid teams all week.
---
The boss was neutral. Can't start the boss fight without talking to him and it being neutral aka no tag.
---
Literally means nothing nowdays
---
What you read was just plain wrong. It's the opposite.
---
Except for shamans. They'll be stuck as Horde since there are no Alliance shaman. Unless you want to let them change to a completely different class...
---
Some of us just love the game world, the setting, the RPG elements, the class system, and the social system.
---
There's no need to write that all off as "a time waster for people that can't let it go."
---
I'm not surprised. And I'm also not hiding in a city either. I rally people, we make pushes. I fight back. I think its funny that a lot of the people who say we should stop complaining also assume we aren't also fighting when we can. I complain during my 2 minute res timer. I'm all for locking out a zone every now and then. I'm in support of groups controling resources etc. But in the here and now, the server is super imbalanced and I cant find a way to enjoy whats happening. The same way that I dont enjoy my job because its fast food at a mall during the christmas shopping season. Ya know? But thanks for the well wishes, and not being one of the people saying shoulda rolled on pve
---
And I was comparing the offense.
---
Yep their stories mirror each other
---
I think OP pinched a nerve.
---
Exactly accurate because I’m using rank point and brackets instead of time estimated to acquire them.  Which is going to vary by realm and faction.
---
I really hope you didn’t do that to your monitor because of PvP.
---
Especially when, with diminishing returns, most of those 1/2/3 honors are actually 0.
---
Keep it online! I will love it! Think of a nice way to combat the assholes. In the worst case keep the notes, wipe the karma.
---
Anyone who goes out of their way to upset others for "fun" needs to rethink their life. Competition is fine but specifically trying to make someone angry is pathetic.
---
I AM TRIGGERED NOT YOU
---
Playing on Grobb it hasn't been that bad. I has a bad hour or so in STV getting ganked by a 45. But moved to a different area and got some stuff done  then I headed to Hillsbrad (30s) and ironically, despite the big zerg fight in the middle, I saw nothing but chill Hordie's doing their own questing and got a bunch of quests knocked out. Then I went to shimmering flats and started a few 1:1s and get beat up in a couple of 2v1s but nothing like griefing.
---
The worst experience was a quick trip to tanaris to pick up the flight point and there were three 60s ganking the road to the cooking quest, but only died a couple of times. On the whole it's been worse than pre honor, but still playable.
---
I dont know why, but everytime this passes while I scroll by I read:
---
 **GF came down to tell horde on Skeram to stop exploiting rooftops!**
---
Everyone does this with Druids when commenting. Whether it’s feral or boomkin, they all say “well in top end raiding guild it’s actually really good blah blah blah”. Yeah I get that... but that is in regards to 1-2% of boomkins/ferals. Then they try to use this rational to advocate for the remainder of the Druid.... im sorry to break it to you but those elite boomkins or ferals are not the guys you are playing with, since not everyone who plays this game is in a top end raiding guild.
---
Even though we don't have reliable statistics to use, I'd argue the imbalance we're seeing in Classic is far worse and far more prevalent among most servers vs imbalance that existed in TBC and WoTLK. 
---
Been playing this game since Vanilla, and pretty much every new xpack I either transferred to a new server or rerolled on a new server. I've played on both ultra low pop realms where there was only 1 raiding guild, and on servers that had US top 10 guilds where the server was jam-packed with players. 
---
Currently on Stallag, and I've never seen anything like this. I get that P2 was just dropped so more people are going to be out in roaming gank squads than there were before, but I also don't see these gank squads going away. 
---
When I /who the 51-60 zones in the world during peak hours, I got a total of between 30-60 Alliance in all of these zones combined. That's not to say that people don't want to use these zones, they literally just can't. 
---
My guild which is very active had about 14 people on last night, which is much less than usual, and of that 14, 7 were rogues and 3 were druids. ***thinking***. 
---
The roaming gank squads exist and are merciless because the horde just can't find any alliance to kill right now. And the gank squads only redouble the alliance players not wanting to venture out into the world. This means that the horde who want honor to rank up are just going to melt any ally they see, and then camp then until they are no longer yielding honor. 
---
Everyone keeps saying BGs will fix this, but they wont. Horde BG queues are going to be so long that they only way to stay competitive will be to go full on ganksquad mode in the downtime between queues. The problem isn't going away. 
---
A real solution to address the faction imbalance on servers, both horde dominant and alliance dominant, needs to happen or most servers are going to turn into a ghost town for the lesser faction. 
---
It's only been a week, and every group I join people are saying they're just going to quit, or strictly raid log. I'm a self-proclaimed no-lifer who loves Classic and even I'm hitting that point. I can't even use EPL, Winterspring, WPL, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Un'goro, or Silithus. 
---
At this point I'm not sure what there is for me to do in the game.
---
Alliance have training wheels too, they’re called paladins
---
Guards can't climb up there. It essentially is abusing terrain to stop guards from being able to attack you. Blizzard considers this a terrain exploit and has considered it one since Vanilla.
---
It definitely isn't though.
---
Yeah, assholes like OP said.
---
This is my experience as Horde on Stalagg, as well.
---
This exageration is getting truly ridicilous
---
*Laughs in PvE*
---
You know you’re not a dishonorable kill, right?
---
Except vanilla had 5 times less players on a single server so horde couldnt camp literally every single zone (or ally, back then).
---
Not to mention that ally ships dont even have guards while airships guards just got inadvertedly buffed.
---
And this is exactly why the toxicity will only grow. Do you think your experience is unique? Most players don't start off being dickbags. Most start like you did - merciful, patient. But they get tired of being the nice guy and so they turn into the very thing they hated in others. It's a fascinating social experiment. It very much mimicks abuse patterns that percolate down through generations.
---
You know what's crazy too is the guard disparity between SS and Tarren Mill. We have had horde raids before phase 2 push in with about 20-30 players (now it's about 200 players), and like 3 guards spawn. We had a raid of close to 20 and pushed into Tarren Mill, I shit you not about 50 fucking guards spawn and they chase you forever.
---
The funniest thing is one of my guildies (horde on a 65% horde server) complaining about being ganked and not being able to play the game and getting anywhere taking longer, first, we are the dominant faction, second as a druid you can literally escape 90% of the time (also has 100% speed mount), and 3rd bro getting ganked once or twice across 2 zones on your way to a dungeon is not a lot. Maybe he didn't know what pvp meant lol?
---
They would only have the option to transfer to servers where their factions are in the minority, believe it or not there are many servers that could use more Horde.
---
I think it's a little unreasonable to demand a perfect 50/50 split, but they shouldn't let it get any worse than 40/60.
---
You will likely see a bit of a price drop in the near future. For P2 and at the start of it players stockpiled on consumables like limited invulnerability potions (they require a ghost mushroom) and drove the price up. With P2 WPvP activity declining in the upcoming days less people will buy them so you're going to find them cheaper.
---
You could just do that normally.
---
EVERY SERVER has those same questing issues which everyone understands...the point that the other guy was making was he was underscoring the increased difficulties when it's 80/20 population distribution on top of that.
---
YOU completely missed that point
---
These threads sure dont seem like it
---
Ok stay mad then :)
---
I had this happen with onyxia, gave up on ashes/mimiron/invincible though
---
You aren't gonna consider it a perk when you realize this could be a first sign of GPU death.
---
Rotfl
---
i'm glad blizzard doesn't agree with you and won't take action ... we'll leave it at that.
---
Uhm, spy is irrelevant here. We roam Zones running into equally large alliance groups. I’m on biggelsworth, maybe it’s more equal who knows.
---
you people here know that EU get your ranks tomorrow right? US got them today
---
What is there to talk about? Press your 1-2 buttons.
---
That's what I was hinting at in my original comment.  Humans basically getting a free trinket slot.  Good times!
---
*Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games🎶*
---
I totally agree. My guild has a no boomkin policy. We might pick up one of those top 1% later in the game when gear is more abundant, but until our core mages are geared and our locks, we have no place for a boomer. ;P
---
All classic addon has to be approved by blizzard so they did approve spy. They have to change that.
---
i wouldnt pinpoint it down to just mental health issues. 
---
there are many individuals that arent mentally ill, but just so delusional in their arrogance and ego that it makes them "not care" at all. And truly those people actually dont care. 
---
I highly dislike how everyone is trying to push this on mental illness, as if every mentally ill person is like that. Why cant it simply be that hes just a terrible human being that is just very arrogant and selfish. 
---
Most of the mentally ill people i know, are actually kind and humble beings, with a lot of empathy and caring for those that surround them.  
---
hes just very arrogant, has a huge ego because of the viewers he got for being world first, with a lack of a morale compass.
---
I also dont think the fact that he ninja'd something was the worst case in this. The fact that its possible to even do in this game, makes it a part of the game, and a risk i have to take, especially when going with randoms. I dont approve of it, but i have worse issues in life than to cry about such a sad act. I find the whole arrogance and behaviour that he shows around it, to be the concerning part. 
---
In my book hes just a terrible human being, i cant judge about his mental health, i dont know him well enough for that. But im so tired of how anything toxic on the internet is being blamed on "mental illness", making every concerned person who already struggles, just struggle that much harder for a terrible stigma around mental health issues.
---
Agreed, combat spec is pretty much a must go for raiding.
---
KEEP YOUR FEET OFF THE GROUND
---
What is going on with honor? I still don't have a rank despite getting 10000 HP last week.
---
I enjoy winning a 1v2 way more than a fair 1v1, me beeing alone against 2 enemies ofc.
---
The transfers would be to opposing faction dominated servers, numb nuts
---
/r/HydroHomies would like a word with you.
---
I mean you can find dipshits in any class. Usually though a simple, "hey wait for me to establish threat a bit before you drop MB" is enough to convey the message. 
---
I think spriests can be a little more difficult to play for a beginner since you have to be so conscious of your mana consumption / threat generation. Mages are a lot more mindless for just running through dungeons so really anybody can play them well enough to be useful. 
---
Thing I hate the most is not having AoE. I miss Mind Sear.
---
For years and years too
---
There's the item restoration tool online.
---
Running out of mana during a 1v1 is rarely a problem for me.  Dying in 10 seconds is the problem.  I guess if I were to survive long enough to run out of mana the IF+Plague combo would be useful, but at this point I think I'd rather give that +25% crit to something else like Mindblast or Smite.
---
Any skilled player should be able to beat a bot 1v1;however, AV is not 1v1 and its more pvpve then it is pvp. The bot that i used was actually pretty good ( i used it for probably 10 years during retail). It wasnt an afkbot like was mentioned. It was premium scripted bot and it did really well in all unranked BGs. I wrote my own pvp profiles.
---
To a 60?
---
You do realize there is a lot of people who enjoy the bloodbath right :D They are just playing the game and not posting on reddit
---
I get the satire... but this is pvp. Not at its finest... but this is how things will happen for a long time. Soon enough BG primate and certain wpvp events is all ppl will do. Nbut for now it's camping bodies and gy, or killing sprees for all. 
---
Tons...and tons of complaints about pvp this past week. I feel kinda bad for em but then I dont. It's literally a part of the game u signed up for. Do we whine when we lose like this on call of duty and other pvp games? I jist don't get all the fuss. If pvp isn't ur thing why roll on this servers where u know u won't enjoy ur leveling or raiding experiences
---
If you're raiding and really want to min max you should look into spelladin build
---
Except that those roles are reversed, horde outnumber alliance on the majority of servers and every alliance flight master is camped by a bunch of horde rogues and hunters.
---
Wdym, if you're a LVL 60 and you kill me when I'm 31 levels lower it's a dishonorable kill
---
Kill boars!!
---
I expect it'll cool down a bit as people realize how little rank they've gotten with the reset and how absurd the honor system is if you want to rank up. Maybe I'm being too optimistic.
---
Yessir
---
Are you high bro? Hunter is top tier in levelling content. Mages yeah for aoe groups, but for normal groups overall hunter is gold. (If the hunter knows wtf they are doing ofc)
---
Feral tanks are also incredible, 10x better than any warrior. It’s just simple, they do aggro well and have godly armour and double up as motw and innervate givers.
---
Imo SP and ret is terrible lol. Their dps is fine but they are sitting all the time.
---
It is capped at rank 3 al this kills wasted
---
... No? Where did you even get that idea?
---
Literally anyone can make an addon, wow uses an open API
---
And shadow priests
---
&gt; Maybe build a stam set for when your not raiding. 
---
I've been wearing a stam set to get to point A from point B. Shield / renew fear (dispels on self) should be able to keep you running as long as you have an epic mount.  I don't, so even if I survive the initial barrage, I can't get away fast enough.  There have been a few times that I get away cleanly, only to get chased down by people on epics.
---
And even IF I try to 1v1, because it takes longer to kill things, someone inevitably shows up to make it not 1v1.
---
With that all said, I've been able to make it into UBRS from Ironforge with only 2 corpse jumps. Apparently that is a victory.
---
Not the Northwind drake or whatever ?
---
just like itd be cheating to have the game tell you about a critical sound that happens (like someone walking up behind you) would be cheating...yes. idiot.
---
I dont have friends
---
Hi, /u/coolsimon123

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyoobi/free_eu_server_transfers/). 
---
I think the only thing they have to do is restrict the level range at which a player gives you honor. Make people more than five levels lower worthless. That would retain PVP while still giving people a fighting chance. Ganking lowbies will still happen of course, but just having a few less gankings would help a lot. 
---
I love PVP- I’m really glad there is so much of it now. But getting two quests done in the last six hours of play because of the roving death squads is a problem, for me but also for the game. Leveling from 50 to 60 has been paralyzed by this. 
---
I’ll deal with it- I rolled on a PVP server for a reason. But nobody should be surprised when people get fed up and leave because they can’t do anything.
---
So people want world PVP- but they also want to be able to fight back. That’s why I think the best option is restricting the honor-giving lvl range. Not that I have any hope that they will.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
Lul
---
&gt;I love pvp but this is not it.
---
Getting wiped out and GY/FP camped is not PvP in the noble, evenly matched, and fair sense.  However, all of those things are what predictably happen on PvP servers.  Most of us who are on PvE servers love a good PvP exchange, evenly matched and proportionate.  We knew though, that 80% of PvP on PvP servers is the mercilessly ganked and camped type.  No chance and no hope of overcoming the imbalance type.  That's why we didn't roll on a PvP server.  It's not the PvP we dislike, but the stuff that makes you say "I love pvp but this is not it."
---
RIP GPU
---
Kind of. You get to decide when you're open to getting ganked, but since the other faction never has to flag themselves you don't always get pvp when you want. Pvp servers guarantee there will be targets when you want to pvp.
---
Most servers are around 45% - 55% Horde, people acting like its 90% Horde 10% Alliance.
---
I got that tip a couple weeks ago.
---
Agreed. Most racials have very little benefit. Berserking has some.
---
Dishonorable is only for killing civilian npcs, players never give dhks
---
It's flagged more often than you think. 
---
But yes, it's voluntary.  That's still better than getting murdered trying to do regular content.
---
Unless the tip specifically wasn't showing up before, no.
---
BG weekends have been a thing for awhile so adding the tip wouldn't be anything special.
---
PvE realm here I gooooo
---
As a shadow priest who's been prioritizing spell power over mp5 I'm curious if you know of any links to somebody actually doing the calculations. I haven't been able to find anything definitive.
---
Ooops i dropped my major soulstone for my monster dong
---
I find the crits to only be 7-800 so isnt really worth it for me, even with Anathema just dont have enough spellpower for it to be worth it
---
I'm not sure what you're wanting to argue about here?  You're saying you can rank casually for 2 months or so to rank 6ish and then push hard to rank 10.  Which is true, I'm not disputing that.  But its still going to take you 3 months to get rank 10 doing that.  It's also going to take some commitment that last month to get in the upper brackets.
---
\* I will kill anything that does not give dishonor
---
It's not that crazy with shaman. Or any other hybrid class. I thought about doing double priest with one being shadow. You could do resto and enhance with a totally different experience.
---
This is correct, but you can do each turnin type once for exp at each major city. So it actually adds up to quite a bit if you just do it while you are in the cities.
---
I’ve been thinking about making a PSA to everyone to make sure they rank on every character they play even if they don’t care about rank. 
---
It helps the people in your guild and the people on your faction. All you need to do is get like 20 HK a week, it’s pretty easy.
---
I absolutely love this scene and the meme. 10/10
---
Same, 9719 and im rank 0
---
This is exactly what I have been waiting for.
---
Even with a constant bloodbath in BRM for the last few days, it's still not enough.
---
P2 seems to drag on for us and we end up losing too many to multiple fireballs or whatnot. Maybe we have too few ranged when split.
---
And yeah bandages are part of required consums. Need a stack of food, at least 5 elixirs, a couple of GFPPs, a stack of FPPs, a stack of bandages, and at least a stack each of health and mana pots. Plus arcane protection. Just sayin in this meta yes, basic bandages and pots are probably a good idea but running with full consums is more the icing on the cake.
---
If you die outside the door you can spawn inside the door
---
Exactly! Why get upset about anything? Fucking thank you.
---
Hello. Tidbit here. Gnome mage on Incendius. Come cry on my shoulder sometime.
---
"camping a raid" usually means "protecting your group's stragglers as you wait to start the raid"
---
What class are u playing?
---
Your point?  They weren’t released a week after the honor system was implemented.  Doing that would speed up the timeline.  Hence the word “rush”.  
---
Ya get it, right?
---
Telling people that aren't 60 they should've picked PVE realms is an awful argument. If people followed this r/classicwow tier logic your realm would be dead in 6 months.
---
Ok so blizzard should make that using the spy addon is a bannable offense just like botting. That addon really is ruining the whole experience. I mean you can't even sneak around as a rogue or druid anymore because the addon will detect you. It's ridiculous.
---
Why wait for a random moment?
---
One of the bosses is literally so cancerous for melee that we don’t even let them go into melee range and instead we force them all to use guns at range!
---
Yeah, thats the one.
---
I've used up most of my good luck on other mounts it seems.
---
Its super tempting to go back and i probably will but ehhh.
---
Now you're butthurt, fuckin lul dude.
---
Server ques won't do anything. The server populations are twice as large as vanilla. There's simply too many people in a world designed for half as many. 
---
Think of playing a team sport like football or soccer, double the amount of players on each team but don't change the size of the field. It would be a giant cluster fuck and that is exactly what classic has turned into.
---
You’re aware that horde out number alliance on incendius significantly right?
---
hard to say, lot of factors. also i haven't played daggers in pvp before just swords so far so i'm not an expert.
---
That's quite normal, I levelled two hunters, nightelf and orc. Know of a guy levelling his 3rd warrior atm.
---
ahahahaha ofc they are in the curent game. everything dies before they even appear.
---
[the real world first ragnaros kill lasted 7 minutes](https://www.method.gg/video/Br1hXGXJ7Tg). plenty of time to go oom.
---
today it's a fucking shitshow because MC wasn't retuned for Naxx talents and you can actually kill bosses by repeatedly throwing a bag of chips over your keyboard.
---
this was not how MC was back in the day and mp5 was one of the desired stats for pallys.
---
back then itemisation was shit, most of the talent trees were shit, there weren't so many bis blues in the game at launch, ofc the game was harder and you actually need mp5 as a mana user.
---
i dont recall hp5 being a thing except maybe for lvling?!
---
classic is a lfr version of vanilla.
---
This is wrong.
---
Yeah it's never a rule that items sell for more than their mats do, you've got to know the value of items and pay attention.  If I've got all the mats I need to make a stack of elixir or the mongoose, but I'm 2 plaguebloom short, I'll shell out the 60s for 2 plaguebloom (which is over the combine value for the potion) just to round off the stack.  If I farmed all the mats except for those last 2 flowers, the 60s I throw into it isn't a big deal.  
---
Often times though, herbs on AH are over Eomongoose price because I, or someone else like me, bought all the reasonably priced ones.
---
Gnomish mind control cap
---
&gt;a good placeholder until something else better comes along, but neither is BIS at level 60. 
---
&gt; You can get Omnicast if you want, just don't call it BIS. It's quite a few points short of very accessible options.
---
I suppose I'll concede to that. It's both good and easy enough to warrant farming this piece, which is accessible at a lower level.
---
And? Your point? WSG has an objective. WSG has fixed fair fights. WSG has winners and losers. WSG has consistent terrain. WSG has fixed short corpse timers. 
---
World PvP has none of the above.
---
You contradicted yourself there buddy. You said that the pissy alliance didnt think far enough ahead but then want to harp on people getting to play what they want. So to avoid this whole mess I should have wanted to play horde?
---
I think you are mad and not for a logical reason not to mention not even apart of this. See we can all make a statement like that. “Ur just made bro”.
---
How can you buy it? I thought it was a DM Tribute run only drop?
---
Grobbulus
---
I think a majority of the ppl whining about the pvp atmosphere need to take this route. Let's fill up some of those pve realms. Why not ?? You know and knew what pvp was and could be like and then got mad when it was or is how it's supposed to be lol. 
---
Just roll on a pve realm, you'll feel better, level faster, stress less. Doesn't matter where ur at, 40,60, or just level 10. If ur not liking the fighting, then move on somewhere youd be more comfortable
---
Around 10-15G on Benediction as well
---
well this is exactly the party I signed up for when I picked pvp, don't know what you expected
---
the best one: undead warlock
---
I wish more people knew this people always say they got ganked by a rogue. I’m like damn it one person is not a gang!!!
---
Most likely he was in a raid group in TM for a long time. This leads to heavily DRed kills quite quickly
---
Is it?
---
I'm like 90% sure I've killed the boss well before adds came and they didn't aggro me until I charged in on them.
---
Due to the nature of the game, its very easy to develope a persecution complex as you're immersed in your character and the world around it. What probably feels like malicious and purposeful attacks against your character and their faction is much more likely to just be other players doing what seems fun at the time.
---
You are 14 with 65k? 14 is over 140k on my realm lol
---
Warriors dont get ap from agility either, you probably meant hunter
---
Got the karaoke vampire horse mount on my fourth solo run during cata days also XD that drake and that horse were used a lot. Never did get the headless horse.
---
Still, HoJ is 3% drop. Swiftwalker boots is atleast two emperor runs. Etc
---
Why not implement login queues per faction? If one faction significantly outnumbers the other then they will get a queue while the other does not. That would incentivize the majority faction to transfer.
---
Literally the only difference between PvP servers and PvE servers is world PvP. How are people upset about this?
---
I just realized they're color's are the same as the kids hats/hood.
---
You can't get 100% spell crit though.
---
Yeah I guess that won't work then lol.
---
Ah I was only curious I know a couple of our originals left to go somewhere else just curious (:
---
I don’t know? Why would you?
---
Ah yep, I'll fix that. Thanks!
---
Do yourself a favor and go back and read your post to check how many qualifiers you add with "sure" and "but".
---
[live to win intensifies]
---
This is why I try to buff every warrior I come across. Poor guys have it rough solo leveling.
---
&gt;Killing a level 48 as a 60 gives you honor yeah. But killing a 60 gives you 20x more. Just fyi
---
Most people probably don't know how the honor system works.
---
I wouldnt exactly call it "all he worked for" he got popular overnight really fast for hitting worlds first 60 on classic. its not really that much he worked for at the end of the day. He was lucky and blessed to get picked up by a good org. for this and seemed to be a promising pickup. 
---
More correctly put, he threw away all the luck he was given, that he could have turned into a great career and promising future.
---
that sounds fine, lots of people get really good with mouse buttons (including binding stuff to the wheel).
---
Nope, they could hit rank 14 on an alt or improve their Naxx speed clears to be better.
---
ok boomer, clap clap, that's me clapping you. hue hue hue.
---
No, this was a guild and whatever pugs wanted to come explicitly camping BRM for hours just to make it hard for Alliance to get to the dungeons and raids in there, several days in a row.
---
I foolishly thought my experience would be similar to rolling on a pvp server in vanilla. But it's nothing like that.
---
Honestly, they need to cap the realms back down to 3k players max, with faction-specific queues.
---
The game just doesn't seem like it's well-suited for these mega servers that Blizzard created.
---
You mean `string.upper()`. It's written in Lua if it's in WoW.
---
&gt; So you are saying they are so uninformed that they don't know they get almost no honor acting like that?
---
&gt;Killing someone as Honorless Target forfeits the 100% Honor for the first kill.
---
&gt;Corpse camping for hours is also moronic if the goal is to get honor. As any kill after the 4th of the same person in one day results in 0 honor.
---
Hmm, so what you're saying is that if one group kills you as an honorless target, then camps you for four kills, then another group kills you, you get exactly the effect that I describe? 
---
Which is what they're doing. Because they're not morons.
---
So you want to ban the combat log? Because literally all it does is scour the combat log. If you ban the combat log, then you're also banning all DPS meters, threat meters, enemy cast bars, incoming healing addons, etc.
---
There's a reason that nobody is saying "just ban it"; it isn't anywhere near that easy.
---
Yeah i take a cast for the belt and pay the healer. Saw like 30 belts drops during my run. People are butthurt
---
66/33 is extremely skewed, and would make practically no difference on most servers.
---
It fits directly in to the point.... people chose their server based on the streamer they watch. Honor farming and raid parties pre streamer movement was organic. NOT this spoonfed shit.
---
That's where the rage comes from.
---
I learned the lesson
---
Yeah I was just curious no hopes were up I was just trying to be funny lol. Infamous spanned a few servers in their time and died out around cata but I’ve NEVER seen a guild by the name infamous other than my dads guild so I was a little startled haha
---
This is kind of true but Horde still has Trolls. Berserking is such a good PvE racial.
---
I've watched hydra's stream and I'm not good enough for that. I know my limitations, and I'm a decent healer and good at being mana efficient, but I SUCK at kiting. 
---
I stick to lasher farming then killing the stealth dudes and getting the few ghost mushrooms I can without killing anything else. It isn't as good gph as clearing the bosses, but it's decent.
---
Yall signed up for over capacity/full servers to "not have a server that dies in 6 months" telling us we were idiots going to manageable populated servers and not waiting in hours long queues and that all the level 20 normies would leave. 
---
I knew about the massive increase in server populations which was why I was happy to roll on a low pop server Azuresong when it launched as the first wave of new servers knowing it would grow, and it did. 
---
Yall signed up for MASSIVE servers and that is what you got, even though the balance is way off. You signed up for PVP even though that is brutally punishing due to the balance. 
---
This is Classic wow and the reason retail sucks is over balancing. Sometimes the challenge is what makes it great. So make the balance somewhat manageable and let the players do the rest on their own.
---
This was my server before I quit. This reassures my decision.
---
if there was any indication of faction balance on the realm select screen creating a new character, a lot of people would select a different or PVE server and this would be resolved. but blizzard does not provide any of that information. so yeah let's just blame unwitting people that don't enjoy getting ganked by 60 raids when leveling up. I find it amusing you can't separate the fact the honor system is motivating these large raids, but ganking lowbies questing provides no honor.

I'll take a flight path sometimes and just watch the carnage from above throughout the entire zone, rolling my eyes as yet another group of five level 60s bravely takes on a single 52 Paladin trying to quest in the Western Plaguelands. The only times I see Horde getting stomped is when the Alliance comes to Hinterlands as a form of revenge and camps the entire coastline uncontested because there aren't enough low level Alliance to warrant a visit to the zone for easy kills.
---
Dude, you’re getting it now.  Glad I could help brighten your day.  Love and kisses babe
---
If you leave westfall can I have your gold? Cant make much off the ah lol
---
I think you have it backwards. 
---
Slapping people for attempting pvp is care bear, not the other way around.
---
A majority of players are *not* having fun with this update. A relatively small minority are. Most are either raid-logging, leveling alts, or hanging around cities.
---
Or the casual player who can't dedicate as much time to the game as when they were in teens and early 20s. I've got hundreds of thousands of HKs on my original account, but am only lvl 44 on classic. I'm not trying to burn myself out. Play how you want and enjoy it.
---
&gt;&gt;I love pvp but this is not it.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Getting wiped out and GY/FP camped is not PvP in the noble, evenly matched, and fair sense.  However, all of those things are what predictably happen on PvP servers.  
---
Who predicted that my server would be 6200 level 60 horde and 2000 level 60 alliance? If I was ever told that in advanced I would not choose that. That's completely blizzard's fuck ups, and it is logical to complain that they did nothing to stop an imbalance that large.
---
I don't mind unavoidable unwinnable PvP. I *do* mind when I can *only* experience that, while trying to do other content.
---
I pick up 2 common complaints and say how they don't negatively affect me
---
Nice wallpapet
---
I came across a horse mage like 10% hp.  Attempted to mind control to heal them up.  They saw me casting mind control and blew me up. Never again.
---
big groups are completely worthless. anyone doing TM is an idiot to be honest.
---
&gt;Well, some people don't care about honor, they just want to watch the world burn and "Honor" is their excuse for going full-sociopath PvP mode.
---
Or they just don't know how honor works and will start complaining that they didn't get a high rank even if they had many HKs later today or tomorrow.
---
Yes... that's who Kotick is..
---
They mix pve servers into the battlegroups. Those servers skew heavy alliance, and RP servers are overwhelming alliance.
---
I'm not gonna bother arguing this with you. You don't get to decide what does or doesn't make you an asshole. If other people perceive you to be an asshole, you become an asshole. Arguing about it does nothing for you.
---
Shit. I'm getting the leaf tonight on my hunter alt (who is 56 now) if it drops. Gonna be rough
---
I just prefer doing 150 5 minutes runs over 150 20 minutes ones
---
Id do it for 50g, not 10.
---
I was a bit confused because never had this issue until I realized this was something PvP server related. I mean honestly,  what do people think PvP servers are? I dont want to be killed questing so I dont play on PvP servers nor sit in Warmode. I get people want to PvP at higher lvls but you cant ask for something or agree to something then be mad when it doesnt benefit you.
---
Woooooosh.
---
3 piece bonus is prob worth it, but it's a little goofy in terms of which pieces are actually better than the alternatives. I guess helm (+hit), bracers, boots/gloves? My guild hasn't seen the bracers drop. Plenty of useless belts though!
---
Griefing attracts other high level players to kill for honor.
---
Do wool, silk, mageweave and runecloth to get around 10k xp with each faction. Can do dwarf and gnome in IF. Is a nice boost at 59!! 60 of each I believe.
---
Well you can only do 5 an hour regardless
---
I'm not on one of the bigger servers. It's 65k not because I didn't spend much time, it's because it takes a long time searching for people to kill.
---
Yes, kind of seeing.
---
Seeing as you can just download a program and change ur character model
---
I think we're slightly favored towards Alliance, but it is pretty good all things considered.
---
IT kind of was evolution of players in early dayz games.  Players very often were friendly to each other, but once in a while you would meet that psycho who would back stab you.  Players slowly started to be more and more hostile to each other.
---
Poor boy, you're def missing out.
---
You thought wrong.
---
Its just not fun at all if its 5:1 every fucking time. On my server you aren't even safe in IF. Pretty much every Zone is Horde dominated, you can't do shit.
---
No, of course not. It means sometimes you'll have 1:1 fights, or even 1:2 fights. But it also means you'll often have 3:1 fights or worse, which are effectively unwinnable.
---
&gt;  2:1 would still let your faction essentially take over at least one of the endgame zones
---
That's not how it works on high-pop servers. If there are 2000 horde players pvping and 1000 alliance players pvping, there's no guarantee that alliance will "take over" any full zone. (If you reduce the numbers down to like 80/40, then yeah, it's clear that the 40 alliance could find somewhere to dominate.)
---
&gt; Also have to take into account the people sticking around for the underdog team tend to have a different mentality and generally band together as a whole.
---
Or: people playing on the underdog team just spend time running instances whenever possible, so the actual ratio of players out in the game world (not instanced dungeons) is even worse.
---
so worth when you finally hit 60 though
---
If you're a casual, you dont get to complain, end of story. I understand that people didnt get to start at release and that people have jobs, but if you knew that and you picked a high pop pvp realm when you started, you dont get to complain. Work your way around it. I started 2 weeks after release with a full time job and a gf and I got to 60 month and a half ago. I am a casual, so if two and a half months is not enough for you to get to 60, thats fine but you dont get to complain. Could of blizzard waited one more month to release phase 2,yes. But there would be people that didnt get to 60 even then. So stop complaining or stop playing ( if you're a hard core casual) which you are if you are not 60 yet...
---
 Only if you're currently locked.
---
If you can find good dungeon groups warriors are great to level. You grab a few decent 2 handers and just blow through the level 30-50 dungeons with sweeping strikes and whirlwind.
---
If you're out in the world by yourself being a warrior is brutal.
---
&gt;But you should know that as soon as you were gone I popped Soulstone resurrection and continued about my day.
---
Anytime I kill a warlock/shaman I don't leave the area until they release, or I'll get to a spot they can't see, stealth, and come back and wait.
---
i liked his videos when i was first exposed to them. Decided i would give his stream a go. Ended up realizing that he has this braggy and "i dont need any of you" mentality and stopped watching him altogether. 
---
He has a lot of knowledge, but i dont see what i would gain out of watching anyone who thinks he doesnt need any of his viewers. that kind of mentality is aids.
---
Oh ok! So you were just referring to that free trinket. Ya 100% overpowered. I just don’t think about retail as much now :)
---
Is that anything like an *ATM machine*?
---
Play a PvE realm :)
---
No, people would rather not start over 3 months into the game, and are hoping Blizzard does something before they unsub. This has been made crystal clear. Sick of people like you making these bad faith comments to shit on other players just because you're not in their same situation.
---
I have 6 keys that belong in the keyring. It's not an insignificant account of space. Plus having to make sure you have the right key on you when you go to a dungeon if you need person bag space vs bank space.
---
They gank you, you gank them back.  
---
Loot Council for sure. I've been running. Mc since week 2 as one of our core 5 mages and only 4 epics. That's using dkp and some really bad drops. 1 blade, no ring no t2 1 set piece in all runs.
---
Wow, a year ago I posted my first dungeon guide on reddit, and now we're here. Every dungeon is finally done (playlist found here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXH9u0WR-woqFDBTzAGCMkziOwuvleS\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXH9u0WR-woqFDBTzAGCMkziOwuvleS_Q))   
---
Thank you to everyone in the sub for supporting me, I never thought things would come this far!
---
Not sure if you're replying to me as nothing you said relates to anything I said.
---
oh yeah. didn't want to over-complicate it, but just as in example, in TBC (mostly arenas), I've used it something like this:
---
- pressing the key uses the appropriate spell on whoever I'm mousing over. 
---
- if there's no valid target under the cursor, it defaults to the target you've selected previously and casts either flash heal or mind blast
---
- shift makes it hit the focus target with mind blast (though iirc there isn't any focus targeting in classic)
---
- control self-casts flash heal
---
- alt casts flash heal on my arena partner
---
it was ridiculous in 2v2, you could basically target anyone from either team with a press of a button.
---
though I'd urge any (shadow) priests to start using macros like this from level 1, because as complicated as it sound, proper muscle memory will make high level pvp so much better. also, when leveling, one should use multiple bars:
---
- one for generalist use, with macros containing both heal and harm spell
---
- one for healing in dungeons, without any damaging spells
---
- one for shadowform, without any healing spells, since accidentally casting a heal should take you out of shadowform
---
proper macros made life particularly funny when WotLK rolled around and people started crying about ret paladins... and I had the pleasure to remind them that my high-rated priest had significantly less keybinds than a supposedly "two-button class".
---
Was I supposed to read this or give a fuck?
---
I was trying to get into LBRS the other night and there was a 5 man group just camping the entrance. Somehow the rest of my group got inside, but I was mind controlled endlessly off into the lava. Our tank told me I wasn't making progress getting to the dungeon.... Luckily some alliance raid came by to scare them off right before the tank poked their head out of the instance to see what was going on. If it weren't for them they probably would have ganked our tank too, lol.
---
now say it without crying and making up 95% of it
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn.  That's me sometimes, other times I'm pretty chill though.
---
https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23585-shadow-priest-theorycraft-by-killerduki/
---
Started day 1. I can put in about 3-4h during weekdays and 6 to 10 during weekends.
---
Up until the current shit show started it was surprisingly manageable and nowhere near as time consuming as I remembered it (probably because we do everything more efficiently now). Got to 60, did some PVE, did some PVP, leveled professions, etc. 
---
The last 3 days have made me unsub for basically 2 reasons. 
---
1. What is going on right now has nothing to do with the vanilla  experience. The game feels like a bad private server. Which is pretty funny considering the people screaming "#nochanges" a few months ago are defending the current state.
---
2. Everything takes considerably longer. I'm not in highschool anymore, can't be bothered corpserun for an hour to get in a dungeon.
---
I bet the rush of getting a 4 essence pool was like running a 1:12 line
---
Well certainly not in classic. Does anyone around here ever wonder *why* things turn out the way they do? Why pvp servers are usually horde dominated and pve servers, alliance dominated? The statistics across the board will show you a few things, one of the notable ones being that Humans are the most popular Alliance race, and Undead the most popular Horde race.
---
The racials these two races have point you directly to pvp or pve respectively. The increased rep gains, spirit, and weapon skill points for rogues and warriors directly correlate to raid clear times. Will of the Forsaken is the best pvp racial in classic and the shadow resistance(all casters that rely on fear for their primary disables also deal shadow damage... how convenient) and even cannibalize are fantastic for taking down alliance players.
---
This is only looking at the top end, the most popular races. But it paints a very foretelling picture.
---
I am with you. Been having a blast getting solo HKs. People should've heeded the warning in the well-known fable of the goat and the fox.
---
What are you banning??? It works within their API... nothing about it is against TOS. It works using data that is *literally already in the game without spy*, if you pull up the unfiltered log using the default UI and zero addons. All spy is is a chat parser; that scours and reskins the info to make it more useable. If you say "this addon right here is banned", then someone makes a virtually identical clone and the cycle repeats. You would *have* to change the API, and remove the parts that allow it to function. That's the part that other addons can see, and what makes them work.
---
The part that makes spy work is the combat log. So you need to remove the combat log to actually stop spy. Removing the combat log makes all those other addons stop functioning altogether; it's a domino effect.
---
I got 9th in standing with 80k honor on my server. I just pvp'd for fun and got nearly halfway through senior sergeant. I played 4 hours a day since thursday and did it nearly 100% solo or duo only.
---
Can you see your own Karma? Does it work on opposite faction?
---
I thought locks were supposed to get the summoning stone in classic?
---
Have a little self respect, man.
---
Shadowmeld is great for things like this but I was more thinking a straight on 1v1 fight. It has utility and is great for resetting or hiding but I’d still take will of the forsaken or stun resist over shadowmeld any day
---
PvP 'BiS' is situational. However you generally would prefer a 1h so you can use spellstone, cornerstone grimoise, skull, medicine pouch. In which case for pre-raid Blade of the New moon is probably the best. Arbiter's Blade is ok. 
---
Including raids it's Mageblade of course.
---
Its like that on most Servers. Our Server should be 60/40 but it feels more like 80/20. I play FM20 and RimWorld until BGs are out and I really hope Blizz brings WSG before Christmas or most Alliance won't login except for Raids.
---
This should have been implemented to begin with. It might seem like a harsh solution but that’s what you get when you play the popular faction, there should be inconveniences.
---
you could start a new "YMCA" membership though
---
Wtf is wrong with you?
---
Too often people don't think about what they are actually asking for or demanding as soon as the problem emerges.  They want a quick answer without bothering to consider whether the answer makes any sense or not.  The vast majority of proposed solutions for this problem are simply stupid.
---
The better action is wait a week or two and see how the roaming gank squads of death settle down.  That is when you will have a much better idea of what the actual problem is and what needs to be addressed.
---
The people bitching here are the ones complaining retail sucks ass, and then basically wanting blizzard to fix the problems in the same way they claim they ruins retail.  It makes no sense because everyone is being incredibly reactionary to a problem they don't actually understand yet.
---
This shit doesn't happen in a vacuum.  If they start making drastic changes to shit because people are big mad, it's going affect across the whole game.  If they are going to make changes i want them prioritize important things which make sense instead of trying to temporarily protect people who are too stubborn to understand what is actually happening.
---
Maybe your eye sight is cocked up?
---
That doesn’t result in an HK, so no, it wouldn’t explain his numbers.
---
&gt;Hmm, so what you're saying is that if one group kills you as an honorless target, then camps you for four kills, then another group kills you, you get exactly the effect that I describe?  
---
&gt;Which is what they're doing. Because they're not morons.
---
The group who kills the honorles target are morons as they forfeit 2/5 of the honor they can get.
---
If a 2nd group is waiting for the moron group to kill the honorles target then kill the target themselves, it could work.
---
You also have to remember that in a situation with multiple groups are present, all groups who damaged the target get honor (split based on the amount of damage the group dealt compared to other groups).
---
If you see an almost dead target (and intend to camp), you can get more honor by not throwing an instant cast spell at the target, since your 100% honor kill on the target would be based on the 10% of the target HP you (or your group) dealt.
---
You can just go to DM and /1 "WTB tribute rod" an someone will whisper you.  Or you can sit there and wait to see someone advertise it in /1.
---
Exact same thing happened to me.
---
But there's private rooms at the YMCA without hoops where you can workout, and at a height of 5'3" there's some private rooms with stuff you'll need when you hit 6'0". Maybe hang out in the private rooms with some friends until you're ready to play with the big boys?
---
They've made a commitment to staying as #nochanges as possible. What Blizzard didn't adapt to was the fact that the players aren't as committed to #nochanges as they are. Otherwise, we'd all be trying to get 8/8 T0. I wouldn't count on them fixing this, but it'll die down, esepcially with the honor reporting bug. Less people will  bother trying to PvPwhen entire days are wiped from the honor count. 
---
Also, head to the private rooms as a group of 5. If there's only one or two NBA players in the way, you can stand on each other's shoulders to dunk on em.
---
Always feel so sorry for people who gravitate towards humans, who hurt you to play one of those when glorious bearded dwarves feat. best city exist.
---
Bollocks.
---
Blizzard has done nothing wrong in here imo, it's the community's desire to get everything (in this case pvp rank) Now, 'IF I GET IT BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES I'M GOOD THEY NOT!!!111ONEONE'
---
Only thing I could see from Blizzard's end to mitigate risk of losing players would be to rush to introduce BGs as they'd bring pvp focused players to a designated area opposite to having them running wild and loose out there.
---
Guys just gave it to Randy though lol, dude didnt even know how to trade..
---
I’ve already been PvPing a decent amount and the vast majority of players are not popping FAPs or sappers every fight.. some use grenades more frequently though but that’s bc iron grenades are cheap
---
Me 100% rage. My character 0 rage.
---
You are shadow, you will kill them before even getting to 4 stacks in pvp.
---
Yea me too. But it’s not really an option for me. Barely enough time to get on more than like twice a week, and I’m running a 200 member alliance pvp guild on one of the most horde dominated realms.
---
Yes you should. 
---
I knew going in I would be WAY behind the leveling curve with my limited play time so I went PvE and I’m thankful I did.  
---
Still having a blast and I haven’t even hit level 40 on any of my characters.
---
It’s great for defending flags and ambushes. It would allow you to start at a range and get them in combat which is huge for hunters. But in the end I’d still take a stun resit or will of the forsaken over it. 
---
But to each their own.
---
buds, tempest, blood legion are all powerful guilds who own us quite often tbh. really glad we have those guys on our server.
---
Mankrik PvE NA is the only PvE server that horde isnt vastly outnumbered.  Come join us.
---
Backpedal is useful in classic due to leeway mechanics.
---
Why would it only affect some models though?
---
You need to have proof to claim the affirmative. The default is the passive.
---
I love PvE servers too. I wasn’t hating on them at all.
---
G O O D G A M E D E S I G N
---
22k honor (912 standing) rank 3
---
100% correct take though.
---
Because private servers and official servers are coded differently. Private servers had to make a lot of guesses; official servers obviously know what the official coding and behavior should be.
---
If you /sit and get hit, the hit is always a crit. Blizzard coded the game so that a sitting-crit would not trigger talents, so as to prevent abuse of those talents with a /sit macro. Blizzard also added melee attack leeway, which is what allows a mob to hit you when you're outside its normal attack range; this prevent strafe-kiting/jousting. 
---
In short, the reason private server mechanics don't work on official servers is because official servers are not private servers.
---
Did you know there's a limit on how much mail you can get and after that, you HAVE to clear it out to get to the mail you want to see?
---
Did you know there are some items in the game that sell for VERY CHEAP, are not stackable, and cannot be vendored?
---
Just some information I figured someone might find interesting.
---
This wasn't the armory.
---
What's with all these boomer posts lately complaining about their jobs, their wives, their kids and their dog taking up too much time to play the game. Move along gramps!
---
You got rank 4 with 3k honor? Dead server or what
---
That's not what I said. You should try reading.
---
Link for the lazy, yes they do care.. 
---
[Item Restoration Tool](https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration)
---
Damn, been a while since i saw that line.
---
It only does it when I play WOW and then very rarely. I have a 5 year old iMac, so I'm going to ask over at AppleHelp to see if they can figure it out. Thanks for the response.
---
Ok if they are MC'ing you to kill you in a deadzone, forcing you to take rezz sick, that's some next-level griefing right there; I don't know what to tell you except take the rezz sickness
---
Okay boomer
---
Unlikely since I haven't heard anything about it. Will be slightly interesting this time since some people used that to expose people lying about their standing.
---
However, I do remember the page not updating some weeks either which made it not super useful.
---
That sap macro the other guy pasted is the best, but you'll need a different one for pve in addition to it. Also if the other rogue is spec'd sub, they might have master of deception which increases your stealth level, making you have a slim chance at seeing them first. Lastly, as another guy mentioned, cats eye goggles. They are insane at helping find other rogues and stealthed players. And if you're night elf with all of the above, you'll likely never lose a rogue v rogue opener.
---
Half of your kills are probably the same person and you are being punished lol
---
Imagine being failing so hard at a video game your best response is to cry like a baby back bitch on Reddit. Should have rolled pve buddy. Tough shit!
---
Also, I think you're shadowbanned from this thread or something. None of your replies are showing up outside of your Reddit profile. I guess the wow classic sub is tired of your nonsense too LOL!
---
Stay mad baby cakes!
---
60/40 is completely unacceptable. If alliance have 20, horde has 30. Horde will be able to either control more of the world, or just straight up win every engagement. It doesn't matter if YOU go alone, you're still going to be fighting alliance who just got done using every CD trying to survive the 5 man gank.
---
Give me "The Sword of a Thousand Truths" I'll slay the horde with it.
---
only 35 hours of pvp a week, not hard!
---
I’m horde on incendious too. We’ve stayed out of this cryfest so far don’t bring us in. Ya the alliance got their shit together but so can we if we try.
---
The mass downvotes must have struck a chord. According to a wowhead  post from a few weeks ago, Herod is 38% Alliance and 62% Horde. The return of the queue, worldwide pvp where horde outnumbers us, and server transfers have likely exacerbated this discrepancy. Safe to say it's equal or worse than it was in that report.
---
I'm the tank as a warrior. I'm talking about kitty druids
---
Taking a big sip of that confirmation bias
---
I also don't have rank yet.
---
Tell me how you would have predicted herod/stalagg/skeram would become horde dominated and heartseeker would be ally dominated. I'll wait.
---
Better analogy is if you showed up with a team of five people to play basketball but every team you played against was a 40 man raid. Git gud
---
Seems you're the only one here that doesn't. How cool are you?
---
You are rank 3
---
Regardless of the fact you were right, it's still reckless. Enjoy It.
---
Definitely bugs going around where some people didn't update. All last week I noticed that it showed me as 0 honor and the hk count between lifetime/weekly/daily were all messed up and never showed anything in yesterday. Now the reset has hit and my character did not get any credit for the near 500 HKs I got and shows me as getting them this week and having 10.2k honor this week.
---
&gt;I genuinely think people are going crazy camping flight points and griefing all day because they have no idea that they will get nothing for the time invested. 
---
Sounds like you dont understand the system. The griefing is happening because the system is designed in a way that rewards you for doing so. Almost everyone I know that was doing the most pvp knew quite well how *everything* works.
---
Honor determines you standing which determines your rank points. Yada yada, we know all this. Well .... honor has DR, and you gain the most by getting kills without any help. Where can you sit and get a fresh supply of undiminished targets? And where can you camp to ensure kills that you can get without a large group? Well.... that would be flight paths.
---
Everyone that ranked high this week were camping FPs BECAUSE they understand the system. Seems like you learned the ranking system, but nothing about how honor is best farmed. It's a shitty system, but blame the system not the player.
---
Yeah I have been using it, I just still lose against other rogues in the sap battle. Even also against other human rogues too in duels. I have the gear/skill to one shot another rogue but I just can't get the sap off for some reason. But I have changed my macro and hopefully it will help
---
True. Probably because it happened 15 years ago too when they originally released PvP xD
---
Will check your logs. Thanks.
---
&gt;I suppose it's my fault for rolling PvP
---
I don't think so. I played on a PvP servers in Vanilla and BC, and it was nothing like this. I suspect the increased server size has made it significantly worse than it ever was 15 years ago.
---
I hope they release some BGs very soon to get honor farmers out of the open world. My guild is okay since it's mostly 60 PvPers, but most of my other sub-60 friends have stopped logging because they can't quest without spending most of the time dead.
---
And game masters!
---
You think alliance players aren't quitting right now? lmao
---
Skynet expansion confirmed
---
It works on both factions. You're currently only able to see your own karma via the "/karma get" command, but I'm already working on a better solution.
---
Min max is an RPG term from Pen and paper originally. It's maximizing numbers to do the most efficient, highest dmg, etc. It's highly ingrained into our gaming culture as games moved into the computer arena. It seems natural to you probably.
---
I'll give you a concrete example. You create a warrior and lower your charisma to lowest level so you can get maximum strength.
---
Right....but arguably that's what will protect us in a few months when player base drops off a bit.  Only having 3k people at launch is a path to dead servers later.
---
Sprint animation's alright, but it's really all about the kick animation.
---
You're just like the rest of us, just a few weeks behind. It all started with some undead rogue is my theory
---
I don't know  but as an idea, not sure if you've thought of this but you haven't listed it... Maybe it's mostly about movement, and spell uptime, which you haven't listed. Like he started dpsing as early as possible, limited only by tank threat, and minimized time walking (not casting,) when handling mechanics. So it's still frostbolt spam but is able to get more. Also, cooldowns at the right moments. Who knows what he did while he was logged in, he could have popped a consumable for a bit of a boost as well to make you look bad. Berserking would probably be a few percent ish (10-30% boost for \~15 seconds). Also, for trash dps, things like drinking ASAP when you drink, mana pots sometimes, keeping up, just pushing the envelope, maxing damage.

Now, everyone and their 17 family members jump you the instant you're within visible range.

Ironforge is the closest one. There is no mage trainer in Darnassus anyway
---
By this point there should be multiple people on your server that have the recipe, I wouldn’t tip over 10g if you are providing all the mats, especially if you already have the cape from DM.
---
The thing is, it did.
---
&gt;More of someone that takes words literal.
---
You are taking "words literal"? Where are you taking them to? Who or what are you talking them from? Are you taking them for long, or will you be giving them back?
---
Begone wannabe Rogue!

So reading some other comments here it talks about Warcraft logs, which is probably where it got the gear information for my guild. I haven't checked gear on Warcraft logs, so I don't know how they present the data, but it looks like it is using the last fight of the night, Ragnaros, for the gear, so most people, especially tank, are wearing a lot of FR gear that would normally never be worn outside that one fight.
---
Plus you thicc.
---
After killing a warlock or shammy I love mounting up and getting out of range and then stealthing back to wait for their Rez. Works every time and is an easy double honor.
---
I was just getting camped in the middle of nowhere azshara. Ran back as ghost, didn't rez, went and made food, came and tapped my keys to keep from logging out, did other stuff, 20+ mins later I come back and he's still there waiting. Nobody else around, nobody farming anything, he wasn't farming, just got himself a corpse to camp and probably thought I'd brb.
---
There was dynamic respawns I’m not sure what you’re talking about. And maybe for your second point you should just get a better internet connection poor boy
---
You enjoy being level 30 and getting camped hard for 2 hours by a level 60? 
---
You enjoy being level 50 and getting in a fight 3v1 and getting camped by them over and over?
---
Sounds to me you're the one who needs a new game.
---
Sorry, I'm not familiar with the Southshore architecture. What's the bug?
---
The PvP propagandist cries out in pain as he strikes you.
---
No he just had combat log.
---
I upvoted him for greater visibility. *Not that it'll help muhahaha*
---
you work for blizzard?
---
No mercy
---
You don’t move around slowly in stealth, you tear ass to a choke point/objective then stealth. You severely underestimate rogues, have you never been just murdered out of nowhere?
---
Rather enjoyable, hopefully we get more.

My excuse is that I cant stay in a safe zone killing 1 type of mob for more than 10 levels and everywhere that's high enough level for me to still get exp is littered with people who have much better gear and stats than I do so I can only try completing dungeons, but those require other player to also want to run these dungeons with me and be competent enough to not get killed multiple times over without just bailing. it's a shame when someone who's too high a level for you to even see camps you continuously and ends up camping you at the grave yard till you just stop playing for the night till you can log back in rez and finally get out of there. Its fills me with frustration and boredom and it the kind of thing that can ruin a player base and erode a game from within. But hey you got to be a dick to someone without them being able to give you any payback, way to go. dick
---
I made this toon completely randomly at launch because I couldn't wait 4 hours to play on Herod. Did not even think of making a warrior, let alone playing so much on her that she is almost full pre-raid bis
---
No. Go ahead and play a Warrior if you like, but they're simply different classes.
---
You're not wrong.  I learned this lesson the hard way back in retail vanilla/TBC maining a rogue.  You offer extremely limited utility and pretty much everything you excel at is still done better by a different class.  You are definitely the most replaceable class.  It's because of that experience that I exclusively play healer classes these days.
---
Take off all of your gear and nude run from the FP. You can probably make it in 3-5 deaths.
---
Meanwhile every healer I group with "Yes a bear tank!  I like you so much more than warriors!".  Bonus points when I warstomp innervate them if a pull goes bad and they need the mana and their minds are blown.
---
Fair...but the complaints from PVP players do get SUPER old and the mass upvotes make sure we can't ignore them entirely.
---
is it true if i hellfire and die i dont damage equipment?
---
The definition of the term has shifted. Especially when you consider that "gang kill" literally meant an actual gangmember killing another member like blood vs crips type of shit.
---
Wait you already have a 60 and an almost 60, both in two extremely good PvP classes, and are whining about WPvP?
---
Why did you join a PvP server though? I am seriously asking, what did you expect and why is this such a big deal if you are already 60 and in a good guild?
---
Nothing wrong except underestimating classic interest by 1000%...... and not acting quick once it hit the fan
---
Why are you talking about your sever like it has a singular personality of a chill slightly overweight dad in his mid 40s?
---
I only got 3k yesterday. I got 57k for the week.
---
Rma?
---
Here's how I got my Unyielding Maul.
---
Go to Dire Maul North and sit in the instance.
---
Then '/who Dire Maul Hunter'. Send tells to want 60 hunters and ask if they are doing tributes. Likely all of them are. Tell them you'll buy the Maul for 20g, that you can stealth and are already nearby.
---
Took me an hour and I was surprised it did that long.
---
imo, in group fights, the rogue should be locking down the healer. Let the warrior get their attention while the rogue sneaks in.
---
Almost like Reddit's not one person
---
That seems extremely boring and unfun. Also, this playstyle will never allow you to top the charts which is also a downer.
---
People think that because they  spend 80% of their time eating and eating is easy.
---
I don’t agree with that at all. Retail is way bigger grind fest than classic.
---
&gt; vanilla servers had a cap of like 2500-3000 I think while now we are capped with 9000.
---
There has never been Blizz statements claiming this and if there ever was, it would've been attacked and blasted on Reddit, on the Discords, and on Youtube and Twitch. Until we hear from Blizzard that they went with the "megaserver" style previously experimented with on some pservers such as Nost, we can only assume that we have the same population cap in Classic that we had in Vanilla.
---
Leveling a warrior is one of the more harder and frustrating things I have done in my life so... Better kept with a rogue its way to easy
---
Root the mob and then wake it up, it'll attack whatever it can reach if it doesn't have ranged attack.
---
Complaining about a service you are paying for is not being toxic. Being a troll on Reddit is.
---
People are so used to be spoon fed or buying their way to the top. 
---
Welcome back to the classic era. People play to have fun and its much more fun to pvp than pve.
---
He asked 
---
&gt; Can anybody give a source on whether or not DKs give instant -honor?
---
You replied 
---
&gt; Maybe do a little Google searching takes 30 seconds chief
---
I hope you realise how obnoxious your reply was
---
The trading trick only works on the unknowing, the people that hit escape to close the trade and end up cancelling their herbing action.
---
WotF isn't an option for Hunters.
---
Stun resist is amazing but some fights it won't proc and you just get stunned to death. RNG is a double edged sword. Great but a bit less so now since Hunter trinket removes Stun too. Overall, great racial.
---
Most people don't realize Hunters negate the biggest weakness of SM with FD. You can macro these together to great effect so you can SM in combat. 
---
Also just the sheer utility of low cd on demand stealth as the lower pop faction on most pvp servers.
---
There are a lot of ways to get ghetto versions of other races racials: Antivenom for Stoneform or FAP for hardiness, for example. Not perfect and yes costly.
---
There isn't a way to get a ghetto version of SM as far as I'm aware.
---
Death to the false Emperor!
---
Blood for the blood God!
---
Skulls for the skull throne!
---
Buy transmute life to earth or ud to water when you see them. They are super rare and expensive, but they pay off in like two months usually.
---
It's anecdotal, but as a horde player in P1 I was attacked more by gnomes than all other alliance races combined.
---
just goto a non pvp server if youre going to complain about getting killed
---
Anyone who says SJW’s is a brainlet so I’m just not gonna read the rest of your post
---
Yep, its the warlocks to lose not the warriors to win
---
There's no mage trainer in Darnassus, but you can get to Darnassus by taking one of the boats from Darkshore.
---
Delete your cache folder and reopen the game, worked for me.
---
Basically anything weird that happens in Classic is usually solved by the Cache folder, its so shitty.
---
Rogues get into dungeon groups harder, and most of the leveling is done by spamming dungeons, so how is warrior leveling harder?
---
I feel that it’s a fairly reasonable expectation to be able to go out into the open world and quest without spending over half of the time corpse running. I don’t care about getting ganked, but when it’s happening RELENTLESSLY and my only option is to level in BRD that’s a bit asinine.
---
Quick guide to answer
---
1. Do you care about sustain over long periods? 
---
2. Do you have barely any pauses in your casting?
---
3. Do you lack talents to allow your spirit mana regen to tick while casting?
---
4. Are you repeatedly casting spells without much scaling?
---
If yes to any of those, then you want MP5.
---
HP5 is amazing for leveling warriors and warlocks.  Spirit can be better for warriors but it depends on how long you have between fights.  20 HP5 is 240 HP every minute.  Factor 50% armor mitigation and that rises to 480 per minute.  Spread this out over the course of a few hours and you can save substantial amounts of time when restoring health.
---
Neither stat is flashy.  Neither stat boosts your time to kill.  Both stats fall short when you are in quick fights with a high mortality rate (pvp).  The longer you survive in combat while under maximum health and mana, the more benefit you gain from them.
---
Maybe limit it to positive feedback only? That way you avoid people abusing it to ruin someone's karma for malicious reasons, and the rest of us can make our decisions based on the amount of positive karma instead.
---
The only challenge there would be preventing karma trading
---
Also, don't let the negative comments get you down. Most Reddit posts turn pretty depressing and don't make it to the hot list, but that doesn't necessarily mean you had a bad idea with this add-on.
---
Don’t be too thankful, since it’s incorrect
---
your a dumbass,an absoultey fucking dumbass,but then again you must be a ganker right? your nothing but a bully, a bully who gets his kicks from making other people miserable,your idea of "fun" is sure as fuck not theirs.
---
anyone who willingly will allow themselves to bend over and take it from people like you have issues,but then again after 14 years they didnt have a choice. and now in classic its like 100vs 10 of u assholes ganking people.
---
personally i hope that the people who cant take it finally decide to fight back and unsub,it took 14 years for blizzard to deal with ganking scum,hopefully it'll be lesser time to take out the trash from classic,before its too late.
---
Thanks for the clarification how the census worked.  The other component of the server imbalance is how it is common knowledge that horde is the superior PvP faction due to racial bonuses.  Unless you are the arena rating 2200+ type of skilled player, who is constantly up against other 2200+ competition, the differences that racials make in PvP isn't going to make or break you.  The amount of brainwashing on how horde is so much better for PvP is also hugely to blame for the imbalance.
---
I'm not saying that horde isn't better for PvP than alliance.  I'm saying the difference at the end of the day is marginal, and shouldn't have dictated anyone's faction choice.  Too many people spent too long daydreaming about minmaxing.
---
Says the Warlock...
---
Ah you are right, I remember having Wild Growth in BC but it was in the month that lead up to the release of WotLK apparently.
---
Alliance guy lvl 1 puts up any item for 1000g. Horde guy lvl 60 buys it. Alliance guy gets about 800g.
---
Yeah same, there is horde from fp to instance so no matter where you rez you're getting killed again
---
SPY addon is complete horse shit! Its an Exploit auto compiling data from combat logs and creating an in game RADAR! it needs to go
---
I guess you didnt read up about how the rank points brackets work huh? Max you could get first week is rank 4. Even if you are in the high warlord bracket it takes 12 weeks to get to rank 14. At the honor you got, you will likely stagnate at rank 6-7 without doing more.
---
Good bot.
---
I play a 60 warrior and rogues are just different not worse. In PVE it’s often warriors vs rogues for dps.  Warriors don’t have a drop threat ability but tend to be on top with execute phase. 
---
In PvP you could not be more wrong. Warriors are damn near useless in the really big battles where there is lag and not enough heals in the world to keep you up. Where rogues excel, is stealthing and catching an unsuspecting straggler. The thing that is great is all the 199 HKs they rake in. Warriors can’t easily get into 1v1s but rogues are great at it. Rogues are killing it in major cities just farming crazy honor. 
---
When BGs release, it will be the warriors time to shine.
---
^this
---
you can do it with cone of cold only, no? they cant catch up to you
---
Then after you kill the lowbies a gang of 60s comes and murders you.
---
I’m an alliance but I’m on the worst realm in terms of A:H ration. Any time I get my revenge on a lowbie I’m soon met by gangs of Horde who come to the rescue. Meanwhile, if you’re alliance and get ganked and ask for help you’re just ignored.
---
All you can do is look at the information you have and make the best decision possible.  You are the one proposing people regret their decision and thus to counter it, other people should be punished.
---
You said one side is currently being punished by being ganked, but that was always an outcome of the decision they made.  They aren't being punished for any reason other than their own decision.  People are mad because they have only themselves to blame for it.  The answer to people not liking being ganked is to pop cap the other side, and action which was not in effect when people made their characters.  I am curious as the logic of how you consider it ok to literally stop people from playing the game through a means they could not have anticipated because another group of people don't like the possible outcome of their own decisions.
---
And no I am not special.  This was a very commonly predicted outcome.  It doesn't take some mastermind to have seen what was coming once the early census data was processed.
---
The funny thing is how it was commonly predicted that Alliance would dominate classic like they did vanilla and horde would be the ones being endlessly ganked.  The concept happened, just the wrong faction.
---
but this way you get 10g/hr lol
---
Well, this one is currently sitting at a score of zero, so the system is working in this case.
---
How do you rogue vs warrior?  I got jumped by a warrior last night.  I didnt pop evasion, but he had 2 overpowers that hit me for 1k each.  WTF?  I never stood a chance.  
---
How do rogues combat warriors?
---
“It’s not hard to rank” is a blanket inaccurate statement. People will be Rank 7 in the first 3-4 weeks, but it will literally take 10-12 more weeks to get to rank 10. And even longer to get to 14...
---
Why? By this logic, does that mean no one should roll on a pvp server now?
---
[We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a noob!](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/a417ee2e-a768-4912-b70b-68097c2e19c8)
---
Nope. There's no exploitation going on, distract faces them in a different direction, it's not the rogue's fault they kept running.
---
Definitely not to this extent.
---
At least not on Shattered Hand.
---
Lol... good stuff.   I missed world PvP in Vanilla as BG's were out once I hit 60, and it appears I missed.... nothing at all, world pvp is garbage.
---
Kills aren’t estimated... it’s the honor that is estimated.
---
I'm sorry, but you're wrong about "that's how this was in vanilla". I played in vanilla since beta (like many people here), I was on a horde-overpop server playing as alliance, much like it is now. But these servers have much larger populations than vanilla servers. Naturally--the hardware is much better, and the servers can handle many more players than the original servers. Another factor is that the population imbalances are more dramatic, on average, than they were in vanilla.
---
The result of this is that overall populations are higher which scales the imbalance factor. For any given server with significant faction imbalance, which is a majority of them, not only are the ratios of imbalance worse than they were in vanilla, but the actual count of players on one side versus the other is dramatically higher.
---
Where an old vanilla server might have had a 40/60 ratio with 5000 active players, you'd have something like 2000 v. 3000 with a net of 1000 imbalanced active players, which is not that significant. Now you have 30/70 servers with 10000 active players, which brings that to 3000 v. 7000 and a net of 4000 imbalanced active players. That's four times the real time imbalance for the same single layer, which is a significant factor people are feeling.
---
I thought it already was that way?
---
Wowhead BiS guides didn't really update any BoP recipes from Timberjack's cache in DMN. I got both felcloth gloves and cloak of warding patterns and I've mostly relied on word of mouth to make sales. Most feral druid tanks I've met weren't even aware cloak of warding existed.
---
BiS guides should have disclaimers saying they aren't the sole authority on what gear should be acquired. The vast majority of these guides don't explain the rationale behind their choices either.
---
Sure, but if you think the games more casual playerbase being pushed into leaving is good for the game, then idk mate. No idea why people get so elitist about PvP servers/WoW classic in general. Its a game.
---
Can we please shut the fuck up about retail players already? With the subs tripling with Classic's release, it's safe to assume a majority of players aren't retail players. Even with that, many retail players aren't trying to make Classic into Retail, they know and acknowledge they are separate games.
---
That said, I'm sure a great many players (retail players or not) didn't realize people would maraud around, camping every bottleneck, most FPs, etc. for scraps of honor.  TM/SS battles were a given, but the sheer extent probably wasn't realized since they remember how it was in vanilla, when the servers were a fraction of the size they are now.
---
I don't get why people are such vigilantes about it now when it's been like that for a decade
---
I demanded proof not because it's independently important, but because he was being obnoxious by demanding it of someone else. "You have no proof of that! Here's my contrary claim without proof." 
---
Regardless, I think the upvote-downvote ratios in discussions about the state of WPVP in Phase 2 speak for themselves. 
---
&gt;Auto Attack Andy has a lot of free time.
---
I'm sorry, were you trying to insult me?
---
not really, been a long time since I have needed to do GPU diagnostics.
---
And I think I speak for all leveling warriors out there.. THANK YOU !
---
There was only 6 weeks between the launch of the honor system and the launch of WSG.
---
You can easily look up when they said a high pop server would be considered a low pop server now, it's very obviously much higher.
---
No, of course not. I don't think the game devs would have created an ability that's meant for trolling only to turn around and ban people when they use it as intended. That would be incredibly unjust and draconian.
---
You can write a macro to switch your gear.
---
/equip &lt;item name&gt;
---
you will have to change the macro when you change your gear. but it works well.
---
As a warrior my upgrades were a blessing and a curse. Most of the time I’d have to run dungeons multiple times. Now at 60 I heard 40 people through MC with the purples being carrots to make them wanna work together for the greater good of the guild.
---
cross realm was added in 1.12 so it is vanilla like
---
Full beaststalker would be sick, but honestly if you just get Beaststalker shoulders, that's plenty.
---
What server? The way I see it the majority of pvp realms are horde dominated because of OP racials.
---
Found azuergos’ reddit account
---
Since he's on an every-30-minute schedule, it would be fun to set up an ambush for his next arrival.
---
cross realm bg was in game
---
Current raid conditions allow people to afk during thrash pulls or even some bosses. 
---
As a raid leader, check out the segment related to one particular boss in question then compare it to DPS chart to see how does one particular player perform. 
---
There is also a huge baseline difference in DPS based on class/spec.
---
With the best gear you will level faster, period. BM will make leveling easier and faster if you are soloing most of the way up. If you plan to level mostly through dungeons or quest with someone who can hold agro or just like to see big numbers so you feel more overpowered, go MM. You could also just lean more towards what you enjoy playing as you level, you’ll have a better time leveling if you enjoy playing your character rather than min/maxing. No matter what you decide, having the best gear will speed up the leveling process.
---
I am doing some server to server samples of tears... could you please collect some pvp tears in vials for me for further testing of of their salinity.
---
There's probably no good answer here, but as a newer player I figured I'd at least ask:
---
What is the general gameplan as a Shaman for wPvP in a 1vX scenario?  I'm a level 58 elemental shaman.
---
bonus points:  I **especially** want to know how to deal with level 60s rogues who start a fight by stunning me for 1-2s followed by a 2nd stun for 1-2s, after which I am usually at &lt; 10% health
---
There is a pestilence upon this land; nothing is sacred. Even those of us who gather herbs are under considerable economic stress in this phase of the game.
---
legit.  That why they are called “the horde”.  so tired of pussies complaining about pvp.  
---
signed: an alliance gnome
---
You can't pummel corruption because any warlock worth anything has instant corruption
---
That's probably because layering was removed and not because of the honor system. Expect to have queues for a long time.
---
We may be at war, but alliance understands that big shiny item is good for whacking enemy. If big shiny item gone then no whacking.
---
*approaches you with a golf club*
---
You play games on apple?
---
RP-PVP. Chill out guys.
---
This is where you fall on your sword so at least you die a hero's death.
---
I didn’t get the sense OP was crying. You mad cause you one of those getting clapped when not zerging?
---
I honestly expected a corpserun guide to the entrance for the alliance.
---
Early wolves/bears in felwood are decent grind exp with nice greys/green droptables, perfect for these 47s through early 50s. Sithilus's early scorpids have a great grey droptable and are densely packed for some more good exp for the mid to high 50s out of range of high traffic around essence farmers/pvpers in that zone. Then ofc dungeon spamming.
---
This is just a few examples of taking the initiative and finding a solution, rather than bitch about the state of the game and stubbornly refusing to give up on that 1 quest in high traffic areas. Heres more, azshara nagas/murlocs/turtles, ungoro wasps, dark iron dwarves underneath searing gorge.
---
That would be the most "defensive" kind of rating. Despite being one of my favorite approaches, it will also be biased towards players who play more often or simply have the addon installed for a longer time. It's the same karma system thats being used on reddit. Veterans will have accumulated a lot of karma points but you can't really tell if they're a nice person or not.
---
It's not a world pvp event....this is how it was in vanilla.  They added an honor system, then later added battlegrounds.
---
I think we need this as a class. It would be awesome.
---
If we're this far down the conversation and he still doesn't understand, he is incapable.
---
It can be both. 
---
Places like BRM are gank-fests but also basically endless honor grinders. It takes *maybe* 5 people (or like, *a pair* of rogues) to hold any one of the chokes (door, chain, brd entrance, brs balcony) for HOURS and then you just kill every lone player, straggler and half-formed group that comes up the ramp. 
---
It's always new people so there's fresh HKs, the resistance is minimal because people are just trying to get to their dungeons, it's often players in the 56-59 sweet spot for honor gain, and once you start camping there's a chilling effect on PvP resistance because nobody (at least on my server) ever wants to take the time out of their dungeons runs and get a group together just to clear out the mountain for their allies, so the meat grinder keeps grinding. 
---
Occasionally you'll run into a 40 man heading to MC but they usually have scheduled raid times to stick to so you take one or two deaths (with the HKs on you divided by 40) and you're back to ganking for hours. 
---
So they can grind worthwhile honor while also being griefing fuckwads and ruining people's dungeon time. 
---
But hey, we're free to do exactly the same thing, that's why we all rolled on PvP servers right?
---
I played alot at the start and had loads of fun leveling, getting prebis and progressing in MC. We got to shazzrah first try, then sulfuron, domo and rag. We got rag down on the 5th raid where we didnt wipe once which was fun. 
---
Now most of the guild is slacking off. I have about 10 irl friends in the guild so we still have fun raiding even though its just 2 hours a week of pew pew'ing
---
Play about 1 hour a day now leveling an alt rogue. Then maybe 6 hrs on sundays when most irl friends are on for raid + alt leveling together
---
#\#nochanges
---
In my server there were a lot of griefers dont make stuff up
---
I guess, but its the best in slot tank weapon right now, they definitely shouldn’t be rotting.
---
Had a ZF group with a druid tank and War, 2 Locks and a priest, things were going slow and I couldn't figure out why, then turns out the war was speced prot and wasn't doing hardly any damage. It boggles my mind how people can get that deep in and not know what their spec is for. We wiped several times on trash and didn't even get to the first boss.
---
Bro so true.
---
We've been reporting people for it since the launch of the game.
---
Yeah, I've tried both those and they are not working properly.
---
Good idea with Twitter, I don't have a Twitter account though :( I suppose I'll make one!
---
Ty for the input mate.
---
It was an *issue*? No, it wasn’t. It’s part of the game and a vast majority of people haven’t taken any *issue* with it at all. Someone complaining on reddit with 15 upvotes doesn’t qualify something as an issue.
---
Nobody still plays this game
---
Too much world PVP going on to play
---
2 Questions:
---
1. what are the easiest classes to level up in terms of how fast it takes to level them and how easy it is to level them (how easy is it to avoid dying while leveling)
---
2. What are the most rewarding classes to level up because at level 60 they become overpowered.
---
&gt;no intention
---
Then your opinion doesn't matter.
---
To clarify, I wasn't pinning every "I don't care" issue on mental health, hence why I said "often" and not "always". Was merely pointing out that there's often a mental health link, which is a fact.
---
As for Jokerd, there's a good chance he's the cold, uncaring, and narcissistic kind of "I don't care" type, which would put him more into the Antisocial Personality Disorder wheelhouse, where sociopaths and psychopaths reside, for example. When it's not a mental health issue, it can often be linked to a personality disorder. Either way, when responds with "I don't care" to something that heavily impacts them and others, there's an issue there, one way or the other.
---
I never once mentioned people getting ganked as the punishment. That happens on both sides. The punishment is being outnumbered for everything from pvp battles to resources. All while sitting thru the same god awful queue as the other side. Only difference is one gets thru it and can play the game, the other can not. 
---
The whole premise of PVP in a game (that customers pay their money to play) is battle other people for some sort of reward. So yes, expecting a reasonable challenge is in fact what I and others are paying for. 
---
All this “your choices” crap don’t belong here. Your choices in life that are imperative don’t include paid for entertainment. It is reasonable to expect a fix. 
---
The funniest thing is that everything I saw leading up to classic said that horde would dominate and be the larger faction. I know I made that decision, but I wanted a game that was a challenge not impossible. 
---
Bottom line is that this game is paid for and therefore it is completely reasonable to expect a fix. Stop acting like this is game is the same as a real life impacting decision. I want a response to this aspect more than any other part of our argument
---
I only kill greys if I see them ganking.
---
I play on the most balanced pvp server in NA, so no
---
Best way to farm hoj and Savage gladiator chain as a fury warrior? Should I get a shaman and a mage and run arena and angerforge with them 3man?
---
I am not elitist at all. I routinely run PuGs and frankly I am constantly learning new things and making mistakes.
---
What I am resistant to is casual and casuals whining on a subreddit altering the direction of the game. i.e.  releasing things early etc.
---
Okay Gankman
---
&gt;stick to pre-mades in BGs. This will turn BGs into a stomp or be stomped situation. While it is true that Vanilla had this same thing happen, I think that it is going to be MUCH worse in Classic. 
---
From what I remember in Vanilla, they tried to stick premades with Premades. Of course that didn't always happen, but even with a tiny premade of 3 people, you can stop the "be stomped" Most people will inherently "return the flag" but less people will defend, and defense goes a long way sometimes.
---
I've been severely disappointed with world PvP. I hope that BGs can reclaim some of that nostalgia or its back to Console Games for me.
---
Would be great if Blizz rolled out some servers with a faction balance system in place but did not force it on everybody but we all know it will be all of nothing slapped across every server with everything staying how it currently is being how things are going to go.
---
woah sounds like someone has been hurt in the past, we aint all toxic buddy boi
---
There is no reason ever judge based on total damage versus DPS.   Total damage has no usefulness in the grand scheme of the raid as there are 40 people clearing trash, some afk, some drinking, some hanging back to Rez someone, others etc etc etc.
---
The only time total damage matters on bosses  is when you have an AoE mechanic to show some players are actually doing their job to AoE down trash adds, such as whelps on a bad fear in ony.
---
Value comes from boss DPS as it shows your navigating the mechanics and still applying your damage to the boss in a competitive mannor.
---
That's exactly right and I preach it. An organized group will own people here and there all the time no matter how the faction balance is: if anything, you will always have a target. Enemy won't roam in full raids ganking aside from obvious point like BRM or DM entrance, just make your own raid or half-raid and destroy these 5-10 ganking squads then move elsewhere, gank there, move elsewhere, return to point 1, rinse and repeat.
---
Sometimes you are left with no choice, a couple of times I spared opposite faction players then some allies start some shit and the next thing you know you have to fight in an all out war because no one is making any distinction anymore.
---
exactly.
---
Thanks for
---
lol alright my man
---
ah i see it now. that’s evil lol
---
I'm going to make a rogue as my first alt. Still trying to decide on rolling undead or orc. Which do you think would be better for both pvp and pve?
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Finally somebody else part of the caps lock push to talk club. Everyone tells me thats a weird bind for it
---
As a player on a pvp realm, my personal experience:
---
number of times pvp combat was initiated over a resource node: 2
---
number of times pvp combat was initiated just because one side was at a disadvantage: literally hundreds
---
Not to mention that "rare" resources are probably cheaper on lower pop servers anyways. The supply isn't *that* different, but the demand is definitely lower.
---
Could you just provide the list of actual BiS then? I've been following that guide lol
---
Ah the old "I'm-wrong-so-time-to-double-down" approach.  Respect.
---
You're looking at the situation where 10-20% of horde might quit because of queue times, or the bulk of the 40% of alliance will quit. The disadvantages of being the minority faction are such that progression past 40 is exceedingly hampered by pvp.
---
&gt;Ever watch someone fall and you laughed ? Same damn thing
---
Not even in the slightest.  In the original example, you have a griefer going out of their way to ensure others fail.  An equivalent analogy would involve the griefer tripping someone intentionally and laughing at them, not just laughing at someone who happened to fall.  And every time that person gets back up, the griefer is there to trip them again.
---
They are not the "same damn thing" and trying to conflate the two is disingenuous.
---
It was even, it’s not anymore.
---
Could you explain this in more detail please?
---
Play mage. Pulls 2 mobs, no mana. Running for your life
---
I hope the next mage you beg from pees in your water
---
I went from 49 to 51 over the weekend, got ganked a ton,  but I'm still loving it.  I went on the north eastern beach of Azshara and grinded there for hours and never seen another person on spy. I do play horde on herod but get ganked plenty when around flight paths, you just have to get creative andjust get through this. This phase will come and go.
---
Battlegroups were a thing in vanilla and it certainly still worked.  The PvP ranks are only server wide, not the entire battlegroup.  It didn't matter if other people go into games faster, you just needed to be able to get into more.
---
This sub's hive mind couldn't see it coming even after we warned them.
---
Sounds lame.
---
1g port is standard
---
Right, so for almost 2 years BG queues had the effect of regulating realm population, and for 6 months at the end it was changed...my argument still stands.
---
Who was it? I saw Staysafe had damn near 5k kills the first day but hadn't watched since. lol
---
By this logic, people who cared enough have their raiding main leveled and geared + have their hunter/lock goldfarm alt leveled out as well (if their main class is different). It was plenty of time for it.
---
Hes talking about a whole different situation you fucking idiot.
---
Site on a pvp server that is
---
Fucking knew it. That little bugger of a rogue!
---
DaoC was asymmetrically balanced. Because the 3 realms each had very different classes and roles, each realm had strengths over the others. However the asymmetric nature wasn't exactly where you would think. By the lore and background of the development, Midgard was said to be the melee heavy realm, Hibernia the magic/caster heavy realm, and Albion the defensive realm (more armor and overall damage mitigation as a whole). This was not the truth at all however. 
---
In reality, the asymmetric balance came down to where and how the support roles were spread out within the group composition. Midgard indeed was melee heavy, but not because of the melee classes, because of a group buff their healer class had (40% melee haste for the group members). Midgard also had the strongest mage classes. No suprise that Mid had the strongest 8 man composition (max single group size). Hibernia was the CC/heal realm. Boasting 3 healer classes rather than 2, as well as baseline CC in nearly every ranged class made it a zergers haven. Albion got shat on in general and really only survived because of its numerous pet classes.
---
Despite having huge differences in group composition and engagement styles, the game was still balanced overall. Any realm that boasted a highly skilled and high RR 8 man group could roll entire zergs.
---
Glad you liked it Shin, shall see what I can do ;)
---
Get those rose tinted glasses checked out.
---
All kills that could give honor are counted initially. Even if they don't give honor. At the end of the week only the kills that actually gave honor get counted. Unless something changed. In classic the kills were always wildly different from the accumulated estimate.
---
Several corpseruns to ZF -&gt; no one camps mara and ST on my realm at least so level there -&gt; brace yourself and level in BRD 52-58 (corpseruns are tough) -&gt; move to strat.
---
Okay real talk, where is all this dreamfoil people keep saying boner sauce Azshara has tons of? I always find a decent amount of mountain silversage but nowhere near enough dreamfoil to consider it good. Meanwhile anytime I go to EPL to farm I find dozens, yet I always hear complaints about EPL barely having any.
---
It's one of those things, it's not big, but it's moving between Domo adds faster.  Getting in and out of Rag's smash faster.  In and out of Geddon's hellfire faster.  Even BWL it isn't huge, but by AQ it can help a lot more.  Skeram moves platforms, Empes teleport across the room.  Ouro can submerge and you have to run around.  Cthun has a lot of target changing and movement.
---
It isn't some massive thing, or even really noticeable, but if you are trying to go full try hard it's better.
---
Idk...i figure people should have known.  The information was out there, did they just not do their research?
---
It was pretty much like this on Stormreaver.
---
I’d say cheap shot then vanish into garrote, if no vanish I would say still cheapshot.
---
Oh Great Oracle, Seer of Divine Visions! I beseech you forgive a worthless mortal such as myself for failing to consult you at your mighty temple upon the mount before choosing my server and faction. You are famed and wise beyond the seas and stars but I have been foolish. I leave myself to your mercy.
---
Dungeons
---
Thanks god there is another wow version for this kind of people.
---
Yeah it's like people don't realize that. I'd prefer the mageblade over the staff I have, but the staff is still a lot better than what I had prior.
---
Since the launch of classic yeah
---
I think it's too late to do this. you have to start from the beginning.
---
Compared to you, yep I'm a filthy casual.
---
This will get you banned, it is detectable. People were using it to make mining and herb nodes like 20 feet tall.
---
What’s wrong with the questing?
---
Glad they still made time to visit Goldshire
---
When I join, ask "Is everybody ok with my level?"
---
Haven't had a complaint yet. If somebody did, I could leave, but I think the rest might follow and join me.
---
Yeah, this. MP5 isn't necessarily worthless, but it's basically just a nice bonus if it's on something else that's solid without it. Incidental MP5 on top of wisdom is more than enough. All about them crits.
---
You know that the words "horde" and "alliance" mean basically the same thing  in this context.
---
But then I would have to play on a pve server, no thanks.
---
Truth be told though, this time around; the stupidity is spread out.  I've had more derpy shaman ass-pulling and high rank earth-shocking than Hunters multishotting.
---
I have none. . . I'm on a PvE server *cries, clinging to an old Care Bear plush*
---
Make sure you didnt accidentally click on one of your bags at the top of the bagnon window. This hides the visibility of the individual bag. Only reason I know that is because I've done the same thing before.
---
I quit in 2014 and I enjoy wow classic, can't wait for BWL to be opened.
---
There are definitely moments where it tons of fun to find yourself behind enemy lines and give them a nice scare! I cannot wait for bg's! Even playing field, may the best group win!
---
Have fun out there everyone! Dont lose sight that this is only a game. Cheers
---
Only WOW. There really isn't much available. I actually bought it when I thought I would be teaching mac. I ended up retiring before that happened. Oh well...
---
You looked at the wrong server. Heartseeker is incredibly imbalanced in the Alliance's favor, since it was the transfer realm for a few servers with a high Horde population.
---
Very sorry that happened =[
---
I usually try to work this stuff out by forming the group myself and asking a few questions about roles/specs before starting. There’s no silver bullet for people playing terribly but you can do as much as you can to ensure you’re in a decently competent group before committing to walk thru the instance portal.
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
I knew what faction you were before even seeing your flair
---
Objectively speaking, you haven't provided a single counterpoint to my claims, while I have directly addressed yours. But, to each their own.
---
Try the fact that I submitted a ticket about a bug, and the gm’s response was “sorry, I’m not sure how to fix this, I don’t play Classic, only retail”. Didn’t know what to say to that. Blizzard really shows where the priorities are.
---
Anyone have a shaman or hunter they want to get 8/8 in a single week?
---
No, I'm not bitter
---
Fiery
---
Yeah more like a whole tricycle
---
Isnt it the exact opposite?  
---
Blowing all your cooldowns in the first 30 seconds of a fight, punching out massive DPS, then dying, will put you on the top of the DPS meter, but on the bottom of the damage meter.  
---
To me, it seems like total damage on a boss (not trash) would be the best evaluator no?
---
Yeah, I feel you on that.
---
I guess just use the most efficient route you can, and make sure nobody will roll against you.
---
Many couldn't see our warnings because the hive mind down-voted the warnings below the threshold almost instantly.
---
Since you aren't playing this game anymore and certainly don't care, could we have some proof to see your account with all characters deleted please?
---
But there's rouges on the ground...
---
They nailed it, considering every group's disgust when you have to take a 2 minute piss after 4 hours in an instance. Or the guy who didn't take a piss and you have to take another 2 mins.
---
Sac-Fel dom-sac-/dance-wand
---
Personally I think Orcs have it better with their racials and looks.  Plus you get the berserk racial which will boost your damage in pve. 
---
Both are solid choices imo so it’s a matter of personal taste and aesthetics really .
---
I agree it was dumb to generalize I will own that. However in my experience (again, generalizing)  it’s been a lot of Alliance control. If it’s different I won’t argue it
---
I'm looking for an user friendly castbar addon, that's it. The one I really like isn't updated to classic.
---
I would if i could but my mom wont hold a bucket under my ass when i gotta take a dump.

Unexpected letter kenny
---
ohh what an edgy bastard
---
There's already an addon with similar functionality, just without abusable upvotes/downvotes.

Just lets you tack a message onto another player and mark it as positive/neutral/negative, and will show up alongside their name in chat / chat channels.
---
Watching all this drama unfold from the comfort of my PvE server has been a real treat
---
We don't have to homogenize everything, but some things were really good.
---
Like all melee having a kick and all of them being on a 15 second CD (for the most part) was very good, especially when they designed raid fights that required consistent kick rotations.
---
Rogues are a pain in the ass until you get your trinket and can get out of there 2nd stun.
---
You could have just said undead rogue
---
Its easy to forget that every server was different. It's hard to argue for or against something when someone else's experience was entirely different.
---
They aren't thinking anything. For you, it was a sudden interruption that forced you to use your soul stone. For them, it was Tuesday.
---
Life to win!

the invisible walls is easiest.

Not a dishonorable kill, just an easy kill.

These people make me so fucking angry I've stopped replying to them lol. Don't worry, soon he will comment something like "Oh so just because its bad for you it can't be bad for me too! It's bad all around har har duururrrrrhrurrruu"
---
No, it is especially fucking bad for alliance. It isn't the same, your experience as horde isn't the fucking same.
---
1. Hunter. Straight up fastest to level up. 
---
2. I don't know the answer to this one.
---
What is the link to this priest discord?
---
Horde on incendius do not want to PVP, I spam trade all day and I get very few interested.
---
That was my friend last night. Bitching about trying to quest but dying constantly but as soon as he started killing some horde he started to giggle like a mad man.
---
No since 2004
---
Mageblade allows for stuff like the skull of impending doom. Staff is almost never better, unless you really, really need another 100ish health or enough mana for a single frostbolt.
---
it is par for the course in Wow classic.
---
Guild ninjas loot -&gt; spends a bunch of time on forums and reddit pretending they secretly got the kill -&gt; make up some BS excuse about why they secretly deserve the loot even if they didn't get the kill -&gt; pretend to be impartial and not involved in the fight when called out on a BS theory
---
It's Schrodinger's ninja. I didn't ninja, but if I did, I deserve the loot.
---
Not everyone entered the game necessarily doing research. I know a few people who just picked it up on a whim because they knew people who played yada yada. Some people just picked it up because it was a new, hot game that could be played casually, and ended up choosing PvP servers due to the popularity (and much larger amount of servers.)
---
I get where you are coming from, I think pretty much anyone who really meant to take the game seriously knew what it entailed. I certainly understood and made sure to set myself up accordingly. Its the people who just randomly decided to play WoW Classic and ended up getting hooked (and are now too deep to reroll) that really get punished here.
---
&gt;  It is reasonable to expect a fix.
---
Fix is one thing, you aren't asking for a fix.  You are asking to move your inconvenience onto other people because you don't like it.
---
&gt;The funniest thing is that everything I saw leading up to classic said that horde would dominate and be the larger faction. I know I made that decision, but I wanted a game that was a challenge not impossible.
---
Then you have even less reason to complain about any of this.
---
Your entire point is I don't like the game it is, make it shittier for other people so I can like it more.  You aren't fixing the problem, only shifting who has a shittier time.  You clearly don't understand that.
---
I can't speak for other servers, but Herod Alliance is very well represented as far as organized groups go.
---
BRM is often alliance controlled.  In fact what my group has complained about the most, is too many alliance groups rolling around taking "our" honor.
---
If I were rolling solo out in the world though, especially on skeram/stalagg I imagine it would be pretty miserable.
---
Ehh the fights were incredibly easy on some classes and specs, and insanely hard on others. Of the top of my head, compare windwalker Monk and disc priest challenge, same boss, same mechanics, except priest doesn't have an interrupt and the fight dealt more damage the longer it went on when it launched. You were getting one shot through pain suppression and shield on a disc priest and every single ww were one shotting it.
---
How special.
---
You wanna troll higher level horde that kill you when you are worth no honor to them. Go to Gadgetzen in tanaris and unequip everything in your inventory so you dont lose anything if you die, taunt the horde using a translator from alliance to horde to make them angry. Then when they try to attack you inside the city they end up getting aggro from guards and die which ends up costing them gold in repairs and they get no honor while you lose nothing.
---
what's your talent build? If you are using the blizzard strategy you pretty much have to be 3/3 imp blizzard. I use the nova + FS kiting strategy as its a lot more consistent. The important ones are frozen reach for the better coc and fn reach, permafrost 3/3 (required), and clearcasting. If you are initializing the fight with blizzard, you CANNOT override the 3/3 improved blizzard slow with cone of cold, if you try, you will waste your coc cooldown and you either have to cold snap, reset, or just die. In a proper 3/3 imp blizzard spec you will have enough time from the initial frost nova to blizzard until the next frost nova, where you can decide if you want to continue blizzarding for inefficient mana usage and higher risk of failure, or wait until 3 seconds left on the frost nova to cast flamestrike followed immediately by cone of cold, and cast R1 or R2 AE (rank 2 AE scales the best with spell power) to fish for clearcasting procs which you can use for a max rank coc if it is near cooldown or max rank ae.
---
  I think it is a lot better in the long run to practice kiting the large group with cone of cold, it will not only make you a better mage outside of ZF, but you don't have to worry much about the frost nova resists as long as you have ice armor on. The slow from the armor is good enough that you can kite the resisted zombie around while you wait for your coc cooldown, where you can decide whether to blink through the zombie pack to line up the less-slowed zombie with the rest for a synergized frost nova, or chance it hoping that you can reach your coc radius on the outlier. My aoe set is 3100 hp, 6600 mana and on a proper pull I do not have to use mana gem or any consumables even with ice armor on. The flamestrike method also has the glorious chance of proccing clearcasting on your frost nova, so your flamestrike is free. Just remember to keep ice barrier up when you are casting your 3 second flamestrike, and if it gets buffered by ANY attack, cancel it immediately and make sure you hit your cone of cold at 0/1 seconds on nova.

God your slow...scroll up. read slowly and get back to me when you are caught up
---
decursing, banishing, mob being half-dead before the cast land, not using power infusion / arcane power on trash, drinking on some pull cause you're chain-pulling, curse of element not being applied on trash, random debuff like serpent sting being applied on trash...
---
i lick
---
Except the set bonus that makes it BiS requires tailoring afaik
---
&gt;Edit:  
---
&gt;I enjoyed WPvP immensely in Phase 1, but so far in Phase 2 it has gone too far as everyone is trying to maximize Honor in a hope to get that Rank 14 they couldn't get back in vanilla.
---
As if. Getting ganked by a squad of geared 60s as a lowbie is far from "maximizing honor", as you are worthless to them. These players just enjoy killing/griefing other players just because they can, nothing more. Being a dick just for shits and giggles really seems to be a huge motivation for a lot of these players and it´s killing PVP servers right now. 
---
Imagine a CS or CoD Server, on which you play 5 vs 15, you wielding pistols and knifes versus rifles and kills treak nukes... yeah, sounds like so much fun, right? Man, theses 5 carebear noobs crying, should´ve rolled a PVE game, nevermind me "enjoying" a travesty of a videogame.
---
if you die, your dps will go down while you are dead.
---
Not on Aegwynn, that's for sure.
---
There aren’t more PvE servers because they weren’t filling up like PvP servers were. People had nostalgia goggles on and imagined WoW world PvP to be so amazing in classic - and now they’re learning that the game is, indeed, a broken mess.
---
It turns out wPvP is dominated by skilless deathballs, which do not need to use consumables to kill their targets. 
---
People were expecting wPvP to require consumables, so they stockpiled them.
---
This has resulted in the prices of a lot of these consumables to crash.
---
Lifesteal
---
Jesis (hey-sis)
---
There was equal opportunity prior to phase 2.  Its not like they couldn't camp the Everlook flightpath in phase 1, it just didn't return any benefit.  It does now.  At worst, its a disregard for the other faction's experience.
---
As someone who played on Tichondrius since Vanilla, the fucking whiners are pathetic. I've always hated PvP but at least I had the excuse of not knowing about it when joined and played on the server my friend was playing on. You guys talked so much shit about people who didn't want to play on PvP servers and how much fun you were going to have in world PvP. Its not that bad. Grow up.
---
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I was told it bugs out if you're logged on when it updates.
---
It’s not what I want or don’t want it’s just how it should be since it was that way back then.

Enjoy the human leather hats

That is really greedy seeing as booth parts are doing equally much. Maybe try and advertise yourself and see if anyone wants to split?
---
From the recount dev:
---
 *Q: I have a question about DPS...*  
---
*A: DPS is a poor measure, don't  expect extensive discussion on the topics. You will find it already at  numerous places. I only fix bugs regarding recording data, but don't  plan to ever touch the DPS formula otherwise.*
---
That was more or less my experience. I'd always get -10 or more just for pointing it out.
---
Due to server size differences, it wasnt NEARLY like this in vanilla. Anyone saying otherwise didnt play vanilla.
---
Agreed.
---
That's an entirely different view though, raid leaders are very aware of who is useless to the raid for dying early.  They don't care about DPS people have done and then died.  That's just adding a third variable into the mix which really kind of falls into an external raid performance overview.  I guess it's however you want to look at it, for me, if players regularly perform poorly, they can get replaced if other guildies are in waiting.  For example if one DPS regularly bombs the raid, but he is high on the charts, I don't care, he is missing a week for ignoring mechanics due to raid performance, not anything else.
---
Try being a lock that ninja'd a +healing off hand thinking it was sp...
---
He laughed... the tank still gives me crap about it though...
---
Good luck man. My first raid was a mess. Couldn’t get past mag. Spent 2.5 hours on him. If the raid doesn’t go well don’t get discouraged. It takes a couple of runs to understand the mechanics and get the hang of it. You will die a lot. People will leave early, but it’ll be fun. Give us an update on how it goes
---
This is what they meant by "you think you do, but you don't".  The design has inherent flaws, and Blizzard is fully aware of them. They know PvP servers naturally tend to end up favoring one faction, especially when paid transfers are available, because people don't like being on the losing side.  They tried to fix this with war mode in retail, and even that failed, because Alliance just opted out after getting farmed.  Theres a reason they changed the Honor system in BC and beyond and its for the precise reasons you are complaining about.  It is not, however, going to change in Classic WoW.  This is the system, with all its hideous warts.  Blizzard tried to warn us.  Its up to us to either accept it, or to move on from the game.  But you can't say they didn't warn us.
---
Currently STV actually isn't too bad

Tarren Mill on the other hand......
---
She's gonna be the cutest warrior in all of the Core.
---
Is the frost spell reflecting trinket from engineering any good? 5 seconds seems awfully small window
---
Unpopular Opinion: War mode was a good idea.
---
If just you keep telling yourself that, you might even believe it some day.
---
&gt; As if. Getting ganked by a squad of geared 60s as a lowbie is far from "maximizing honor", as you are worthless to them. These players just enjoy killing/griefing other players just because they can, nothing more. Being a dick just for shits and giggles really seems to be a huge motivation for a lot of these players and it´s killing PVP servers right now.
---
The problem is that they are probably so ignorant about the PvP system, and don't know what is effective and what is not.
---
It's easier to believe they are stupid than malicious.
---
If they were just ass hats, they would have been doing this in phase 1 as well.
---
Funny thing... some locks and spriest show up to raids in that helm.
---
After 5 years this mac still confuses me. It seems not to always do things the easiest way just because that's what Windows does. I'm so glad I don't have to worry about finding files because the mac way of sorting is just stoooopid. PS. Thanks for the reference I'll have to go look them up.
---
Rank 10 is my Rank 14.
---
I just unsubbed as well. The game was a lot of fun for a while. Then honor came out and the faction imbalance got out of control over the last few days. I got home from work today and tried to get to BRD. It's taken over 30 minutes so far and I'm not even there yet. Corpse jumping isn't fun. My brother hasn't even logged on because it's impossible for him to lvl anymore. I see less friends logging in each day which sucks. The only thing that makes me feel better is the horde are going to have a small amount of people to kill soon.
---
I understand the mechanics. I should have been more clear. What items for this fuckery?
---
yeah sure have people have to REROLL **THREE MONTHS OF FUCKING WORK**,u fucking moron...no one in their right mind will do that,they will just fucking quit.
---
Did BGs launch as cross realm or was that added later?
---
Yes, many players and even Blizzard themselves were expecting a significant drop off in player population within the first few months of the game.
---
They expected a massive surge of initial activity, followed by a steady decline as players discovered that the game wasn't really for them, and dropped out. This is why they implemented layering.
---
What we're seeing here, is exactly what most people have been predicting for months. It's just that a lot of players are shocked to discover that *they* are the ones who are quitting, rather than it being a faceless group of "others" : retail tourists, nostalgic casuals, etc. I think this comes as an uncomfortable realisation for some, hence the strong emotion on this subreddit.
---
There is an answer to what people are seeing: Faction specific queues. Say servers can hold 12k players. 6k Horde can be logged in at any given time and 6k Alliance can be logged in. While this method does not ensure a perfect 50/50 spread it will certain even the playing field. What we are seeing on Herod right now is that same 12k being logged in, but instead of 6k/6k we see 9k/3k. With a faction specific queue we could see 6k/5k or even 6k/4k. Both of which would be better options than 9k/3k. 
---
Anyone that thinks they are an elite PVPer should be arguing for a 50/50 spread. 
---
This does not stop the raid groups. But it would ensure that the statistically less populated faction could muster a much closer 1:1 defense/offense. Instead of the 3:1 or in some cases 12:1 that we are seeing today.
---
IMHO: Blizzard should have made faction specific queues day 1. That would have incentivized the overpopulated faction to transfer and balance servers. Again, would not be perfect. But instead of a 75/25 being the norm we would see that as an outlier. with 60/40 being the norm.
---
No one is complaining about wpvp.  They're complaining about seriously skewed faction balances as a total and logged in.  Alliance is litereally screwed on most servers.
---
Want a legitimate question?

Ask him what his long term strategy for for MTX is. 
---
Considering the Chinese government crackdown on under-18 playtimes and spending, calls in western counties for regulations on loot boxes, and companies like Ubisoft announcing a shift away from MTX... why is it a good investment to back aggressive MTX companies like Activision-Blizzard?
---
Yes.
---
My raid group has started recording logs last like 4 weeks since we got MC on farm now and been "competing" with our other raid teams + other guilds I suppose. I'm ok with it except it confused me this last week. At least with how it reads verse other players. 
---
Like 3 weeks ago I was in top 75% of people fighting rag ... or my dps was. Then the next week I was like 65% or something. Then last week with better gear and doing more dps my % dropped to like 40. I just dont get how my overall dps is getting better and going up but I'm parthing lower every week in most fights. Makes no sense to me and starting to bother me making me think I am not improving. Yet my recount dps each fight is a lot higher than it was before. But we are also killing bosses much faster so fights are shorter. 
---
Idk... I think judging dps performance is tough to tell in raids.
---
Jeboobs
---
I don't see a lot of warlocks, they seem to look challenging and powerful, are they considered easy to level?
---
I don't use recount so I can't tell you anything about it. I like Details! better because it has way more options to play with.
---
Oh but you can target him while in stealth now?  How is that not busted?
---
Hi, /u/CptJonzzon

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyqa99/howcome_rogues_and_druids_can_attack_me_when_im/). 
---
Yeah you have to wait until theyre out of rage, and the bleeds wear off.
---
It isn’t, you absolutely can top the charts, and you come off as never having played a stealther. It’s only unfun for the opposition.
---
There are so many intricacies required to be just ok at pvp when you're a pve specd healer - really you have to understand what other classes are trying to do to you so you can stay ahead of them OR compensate for your spec with consumables.
---
Get that warrior in combat asap so he cannot open with charge.
---
If you see a rogue stealth and you fear for your life a couple of rank 1 holy novas are worth casting to try to light them up or possibly discourage them from closing on you - you need to keep them from opening on you or you'll likely die - but you can make that opening moment more of a coin flip than a guaranteed rogue win.
---
A mage cannot kill you without crazy burst in world pvp...seriously they cannot unless you let them hold you still. Dispel everything that slows you down and run for help - your renew ticks and pws should out heal any instant casts he can spam at you while running - if he closes you fear and continue running.
---
Warlocks, Hunters, and other priests that attack your mana are trouble - you need to commit to reckless offense as you won't be able to heal and work through their health before you OOM.
---
It's ironic, because only the hardcore players wouldn't scoff at the idea of re-rolling - they're spending so much time in game already. The people bearing the brunt of this dysfunction are the ones that are gonna be set back the most (in terms of real-life time to recover) by having to re-roll. But just do it or you're just whining, right?
---
&gt;  forcing a population of players to not play based on an arbitrary faction choice.
---
which is exactly whats happening NOW for alliance. especially on the extremely imbalanced servers. 
---
&gt; If I was put into a queue because I happened to choose horde instead of alliance (when I’ve always played alliance!) I would quit.
---
So alliance has to wait in queue AND not be able to play when they finally get in?
---
&gt;but it matters to my friends on the server I play on, my guild mates and blizzard who gets to pocket my sub money.
---
Fuck you I got mine right?
---
Meanwhile fraction queues, will balance everyones overall playing, maybe even help grow the alliance base overall with new players picking alliance for faster queue times.
---
It is simply the best for everyone INCLUDING horde for the longevity and overall enjoyment.
---
The horde have set up a train all the way from TP to BRD/BRS literally death walking the entire way, how is this fair in your mind?why should alliance wait in queue for hours then spend hours just getting to a dungeon? Oh ya, because fuck you I got mine. I hope it happens and I hope players like you quit, shitty attitudes are taking up valuable spots from people that actually want to play and have fun.
---
Huh?
---
Stop casting spells that are damage dealing.
---
If you prefer pve, then reroll on a pve server
---
No, Hellfire is a Warlock ability that deals damage to the player and all enemies nearby. Stuff coming out of the ground is bad.
---
Why not ask yourself, why are there so many "whiners" ?
---
How is that even possible
---
I seem to only come across a good bow once every 10 levels. And its kinda funny, but I think that so far I've used the exact same ones I did back in the day. 
---
Daryl's Bow at 11 I think? Raptors End at 20, Long Redwood at 30, and Im about to equip Needle Threader in one level at 42... which someone gave me for free!! In vanilla it dropped for me, so I guess Im just destined to use it. Its a faster bow at 2 seconds, so Ill see how it goes.
---
Greater arcane, elixir of shadow power, pre-GFPP and drop another one after your GFPP is used up.  It's better to not take damage by using a second gfpp than mana pot and eat a fireball and not be able to lifetap or drain your healer's mana and wipe.  You can also get a tiny bit more DPS by using Nightfin or Rum Tuber food buff (either are fine), plus Gordok Grog.  Not big buffs but also not terribly expensive compared to the elixirs. 
---
Not all the BIS lists are very good.  Spell/shadow power is your priority, along with +hit and +crit.  Stats are not worth a lot for your DPS.  It's about 5 int for 1 spell power on very long battles since int gives such tiny amount of crit chance and it takes a TON to give you enough mana for just one extra shadow bolt. 
---
Warlocks really need to be kitted very well to compete on DPS.  You need to min/max.  Don't run Crimson Felt Hat, run the Green Lens +36 shadow or a +39-40 shadow BOE.  Same with boots, BOE +29-30, not Omnicast, Maleki is ok.  +20-21 cloak is quite a bit better than even the Sapphiron cape drop from Ony.  +29-30 bracers are better than Sublime or even Felheart.  Warlock tier is not BIS at all, though the legs are ok and only a tiny bit behind Skyshroud so if you ever die it might be worth swapping over.  
---
Star of Mystaria and Ban Thok Sash are your only pre-raid +hit% so make sure to get both, they will help your banishes land even the DPS shows lower than other options (Vectus, raid drops, etc).  Landing banishes is important for the raid.  On Garr it is way more important than your DPS. 
---
You can get your Libram of Focus for another +16 total spell power.  Go ahead and put that on your Skyshroud pants once you get them, and either your Green Lens or +39-40 BOE if you go that route.   
---
Eye of Org/Songstone of IF, Briarwood Reed, and Eye of Beast are all very important DPS items for a warlock.  You should have all of those. 
---
You should be able to get over 350 total spell/shadow power with pre-bis, theoretical max is still higher, but 340-350 is a good target if you want to be reasonable competitive.  
---
Keep in mind once everyone maxes out that fury warriors just trash everyone else on DPS.  Warlocks are likely still a few percent behind mages with equal prep as well, but that's still very respectable. You're there for banish, summs, soulstones, and healthstones, as well.  You're not expected to top DPS, but you can certainly contribute a good chunk with the right prep.
---
watch clazzy or orangemarmalade, those are top mages.
---
Venruki in its time competing vs orange...
---
Not being salty...
---
You just reminded everyone that they need to camp warlock bodies until they release. You’re doing the lord’s work.
---
You right. My bad.
---
I don't remember the name, I just saw a screenshot of the honor screen on Venruki's stream.
---
&gt; WoW Classic PVP servers are now PvE servers but for one side only.  
---
yup, cause all the alliance left  
---
hf on your one side only PvE server
---
Cuergos Gold is an actual shit quest though. If you dont have aoe and slows, theres no way you solo it. And if you die, the spawn is on the other side of the fucking map. Everything despawns before you can walk back. And if you loot the key before dying, you can no longer reset the quest and have to surrender it. Worst quest design i have ever seen.
---
Spy is busted
---
*Point out that servers in Classic are literally 3-10x larger than they were in Vanilla and having that many more people makes phase 2 even worse and demonstrably different from Vanilla* 
---
*Ignore the comment, call them a scrub, tell them to roll PVE, carebear.*
---
Our guild is on dreadmist, which seems to be heavily horde domimated and we're thinking about moving to bloodfang. They seem to have a better balance and a smaller population
---
At launch, server caps were much lower, but they caused 6 hour queues.  People lost their minds and Blizzard relented.  The current situation is a direct result of that.
---
Well I play one at this very moment. How would you too the charts holding choke points while the warriors and mages are constantly getting kills and damage while in a group battle?
---
No, it's just an honorless kill..
---
I know that. I'm not debating that. I was asking, is it not ok for people to join pvp servers now that p2 is out?
---
The boomkin aren't pulling insane dps.  They're there because they need something to cast Faerie Fire without a cooldown, and because at the high end Rest druids can't compete on heals because buff slots are limited...
---
I don’t get it what’s with the screenshots. Does no one has a phone to take pictures with these days
---
You probably accidentally clicked one of the bag icons at the top that will hide or show specific bags.
---
So I looked into this because I never got the obsession with MP5 for shamans. Having done the napkin math, shamans are very much in error for stacking MP5. It's really low value for them. You should instead be focused on heal and int. That combination will give the best throughput and I hear from some top shaman healers that this is how they have been itemizing anyway as well. MP5 is no one's go to best stat unless fights magically all get longer - then it's everyone's best stat.
---
Daboo
---
na, not as arms. In a duel a warrior will "almost" always win a duel against a lock. In open world pvp a warrior will "almost" always win a fight with a lock too...then die 5 to 10 seconds later as the dots catch up to them.
---
They're not. Horde players are far more interested in camping and being cunts. I've seen this time and time again after playing both sides. It's about the type of person drawn to each faction.
---
Level 55 warrior, I feel your pain. I did BRD last night, I used inviz potions to help me get there, only took 9 deaths as opposed to 12 the night before. Best idea is to find a BRD group that wants to farm exp, you can run dungeon, invite a 6th member as part of a raid, original 5 logs out and 6th member then resets instance. When you all log back in you will be in a fresh instance
---
Thanks ! Will try that!
---
I didnt ask what blizzard thought of the situation, you said they were fighting for the mob, continuing to banish a mob someone else tagged isn't fighting for the mob, is it?  And the consensus is that he is griefing, here is a quick definition for you  "A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game, using aspects of the game in unintended ways".   
---
Your argument that since blizzard didn't act on it that they condone it, that means every time someone spams something racist in game and isn't banned that blizzard is cool with it?
---
PvP servers back in the day =/= pvp servers today
---
Agi / Crusader are also good
---
They did see it coming.  Server caps were much lower at launch, but people screamed and they relented and raised caps.  There is a reason they tried their hardest to not raise caps initially, and it is because they saw this as a likely result.  And yet here we are.
---
Old Blanchy is almost 1:1 assuming https://ironforge.pro/servers/ is accurate.
---
My sweet summer child......
---
If I can't transfer from a PVP server to a PVE server, there is no point in playing anymore.  The game isn't fun the way it is now for Alliance players.  I'm not restarting from scratch after all my time invested in my account.
---
My dps is 2.1k for the second that my shadow bolt crit lands
---
I'm sure population imbalance will help, but it won't change the behavior of people seeking fights that they know they can win by running in packs and targeting solo players.
---
You thought you did, but you don't.
---
yea maybe if ur fighting a really bad warlock LOL. duel me ill win 100% of the time. i can literally promise you,ive never lost to a warrior in wpvp or duels. whitemane
---
I would try making a post on the official forums. People there call out player all the time I feel like. Not sure if it's allowed there but I would try in.
---
It's always been about who has the best gear and the most people.
---
The problem is knowing that if you do that, you're just contributing to the problem. And I don't really want to go to an Ally-dominated server - that's no fun either.
---
Tell me how you would have predicted that heartseeker would be the only pvp server that is alliance dominated. I'll wait.
---
At least not everyone
---
You say that but the march towards pay-to-win, dungeon simulator, daily repetition questing in retail was paved by whining
---
Dude what the hell is up with the video suggestions that come up after your video
---
Rogue shows up and saps the level 60. Kills lowbie. Vanish.
---
People wanted vanilla.. well here ya go
---
Servers were even worse off in vanilla
---
Blame the nochanges fools - Blizz could have easily said they would micromanage servers more but the community would have tossed a fit
---
You a bitch, this why we Horde /spit on you as you gank us. Peoole like you are why the Horde and Alliance can't get along. /shoo /spit /rasp
---
Hahahaha
---
Hamstring?  It seems like Warriors have so many counters to rogues.
---
Oh? Where did they advertise herod/stalagg/skeram as the horde dominated servers and heartseeker as the alliance dominated pvp server? Must have missed the announcement.
---
Guess yah wrong my frand
---
Ill check that out for sure, thanks !
---
Hamstring doesn’t counter the poison kiting
---
Can you link your build? Are you using 2H?
---
Awesome, I think ill give another add-on a go. Thanks for the suggestions !
---
yeah, some people likely haven't realized that getting to rank 14 will take longer than the game has even been out for so far.  Just imagine everything you've done since launch, take that same amount of time and dedicate it to mindnumbing hk grinding.
---
A guildie just bought one for 400 recently.
---
Inb4 mods delete this for low effort meme or some bullshit.
---
When i first read that a medium server would be the same as a full vanilla server I thought " this will end....poorly"
---
&gt; if you chose a PvP server knowing you'd hate this, you only have you to blame.
---
Exactly, but they're still blaming Blizzard. Big, manly PvPers can't even take responsibility for their own actions. It's not like they hadn't been warned that this would happen.
---
Why skip wpl epl because of argent dawn rep?
---
Yikes for someone on a pve server, you're really upset about pvp.
---
The fact that they made it out of Northshire Abby during the PVP storm is noteworthy.
---
And here I thought being 50% into rank 3 meant I was bad. Turns out I’m not that far from what the cap was  for week 1 anyway.
---
Hey I saw this episode of black mirror
---
Hi, /u/Plevz

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [Looking for Group/Guild/Players Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
Why is it a trap? Is an extra 90ap on the two swings of Windfury just not really noticeable damage wise?
---
On that last note: it always bugs the crap out of me when mages and healers do not immediately drink after combat. It makes no sense. Some people literally do nothing maybe pick their nose or something for 5 secs then drink. Water is basically free as a mage so there is absolutely no reason not to. I’m not saying dungeons need to be gogogo all the time but why wouldn’t you immediately drink to be ready for the next pull?
---
which ever one actually drops first
---
-Michael Scott
---
It's based on your percentile in honor earned each week. That converts into a certain amount of rank points. See [here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/618977045006778399/646441743687876609/Screenshot_20191119-150820_YouTube.jpg?width=800&amp;height=390) (sorry, can't find a text version of this table anywhere??).
---
So the top 2% of players last week earned at least 10k RP which is Rank 4 according to the tables [here](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/honor-system-overview). Rank 5 is impossible since that requires 15000 RP and the max you can earn in one week is 13000 RP.
---
&gt;They're offering that experience to invalidate the experience of others that have been described here at length.
---
Yes the experience of others is PvP on a PvP realm that's within the TOS.
---
Hate to be the guy that beats a dead horse, but you knew being camped, griefed, and logging off because there's nothing you can do is how Phase 2 would play out. Or maybe you specifically didn't since you never read their phase plan.
---
I saw in another spot you want Blizzard to completely remove the honor system outside of BGs. I'm glad the loud minority on reddit isn't given the time of day by the classic dev team on change suggestions, because QoL changes is what led to retail's death by a thousand cuts. Keeping the game as close as possible to the original is what the vast majority of players signed up for. Sorry the game isn't exactly what you want
---
Join a guild, form a group, and stop complaining.
---
Which?
---
could have multiple scores / breakdown. Personal v world score broken down to Dungeon vs Open world. That alone would curb abuse. Then you could also implement some kind of decay system where votes older than X drop off.
---
Yes, I am! I am full of schadenfreude right now because prior to release I've been down-voted to hell and back by the subreddit hivemind for predicting that this would happen. I'm not above rubbing it in.
---
Maybe just maybe the people killing all allinace questgivers across mulitiple zones should stop farming dk's and griefing lowbies. I don't think people understand that as soon as 17/18 alliance have to venture into contested territory unlike horde.
---
Lots of whining about it now from Alliance, but when BGs are a thing and Horde queues are an hour long...
---
what, a rogue with a binding? did ur MT get his binding first at least?
---
Calls Classic broken.  
---
Wants #change now.  
---
Yea, why do you think WoW has changed so much over the decade.  
---
And you're trying to play a remake of WoW at it's most inbalanced state.  
---
Also, remember the folks who wanted #change before Classic was released? And they were absolutely downvoted. Oh how the time change.
---
why the fuck is he wearing frostwolf tab??
---
I wonder what a warriors dps is when they crit every attack after a sword spec'd proc with windfury in that 1 second alongside mortalstrike.
---
Most of us are Zoomers, we did this back in 2004
---
Yeah. I don't get that.
---
Except this #nochanges started with big changes. There's at least 5x's the ppl on the same size Azeroth.
---
yeah I don't disagree I just don't think that impacts ease of ranking. In that scenario everyone you're playing against is also in that same position. I guess it could add a little more of an RNG component but I still think over the course of the entire week the person who tries the hardest and to a lesser extent plays the best is going to have more honor. Same as it is on Faerlina
---
I can't believe they would institute honor and "wUrLD pVp" without at least releasing one battleground as a pressure release valve.. I am lvl 52 Alliance on Rattlegore and Horde camps half of the flightpath landings.
---
A faction queue would take hours and hours to go through. It’s not like a regular queue; please don’t compare your corpse run that I’ve done many (many) times to actually being locked out of the game. It’s not like a regular queue; alliance and horde likely log at the same rate
---
Rest of your post is just attacking me so whatever. Sorry that you didn’t read the countless posts saying that super high population servers were going to be cancer for one faction or the other, as has been the case for many private servers (albeit not to this extent)
---
I did note on Blizzard's failure to adapt to the current state of affairs, yes.
---
They count 4 times
---
Yea gotta be honest everyone is complaining about getting ganked non-stop and im like dude...just re-roll if you don't know how to handle the pvp servers. I constantly see people doing things that you should never do on a pvp server (ie AFK in contested areas) and then they complain when they get killed. I know you feel like you will get judged as someone who "can't handle pvp" but guess what? who cares! Go have your fun. If pvp isnt fun for you then reroll on a non-pvp server.  I'm glad you made the leap OP and wish you happiness in your new home!
---
&gt; you knew being camped, griefed, and logging off because there's nothing you can do is how Phase 2 would play out. Or maybe you specifically didn't since you never read their phase plan.
---
...which is fine. 
---
&gt;I saw in another spot you want Blizzard to completely remove the honor system outside of BGs.

---
There is one particular, egregious error in PVP servers. In the end, I would be absolutely fine with paying for a transfer to a PVE realm, and consider it a stupid tax for not researching more. I'm not willing to throw away 250 hours of gameplay.
---
have votes drop off after a certain amount of time. Say, 2 weeks - 30 days something like that
---
Ehh, I'm torn.  When I did play wow like 11 years ago, world pvp was occasionally stumbling into an alliance and maybe we'd fight maybe we wouldn't.  
---
I really had no idea just *how many people* would be in the world.  
---
None of that info is immediately available.  Friends said "hey we're alliance on this server come play!"  And that was that.  When you hit that select server screen it doesn't tell you "Hey this server is *packed* and 70% horde good luck you fking madman you."
---
Yes you must be the single one person to ever figure that out? Holy shit how do we function as a society without your vast intellect?shut up and stop being a cunt for no reason.
---
Whats everyones thoughts on Faction specific queues? I personally would wait in a queue if i knew that the server would be balanced when i log on.
---
Hanlon's Razor, and all that.
---
They could run a dungeon. And it's not about unwillingness to help,. I've been with this guild since vanilla so I'm not unhappy in the slightest except for maybe their choice to roll on a PvP server again haha. They are always willing to help with cooldowns or running people through lower level dungeons.
---
 
---
I don't want to run dungeons right now. I'm at level 49 so spending the next 11 levels in BRD or ST isn't  appealing to me when I'm going to be spending time at 60 running dungeons to gear up. I shouldn't have to hide in dungeons to play the game. And even if I did, that's 45 minutes to get to BRD because of all the corpse running, and then another corpse run or two because we dared to zone out to reset the instance. 
---
A PvP server, as they are, obviously isn't for me, and if it wasn't for the guild I play with or the time I've already put in, I wouldn't be as bothered by it. The levelling zones from 48-60 right now are unplayable if you're the less dominant faction on your server, Horde or Alliance. I'd need a raid group to kill 12 lava spiders in Searing Gorge right now. So I'm just not playing at all.
---
As others have pointed out, fury/prot is a joke. Even as 60 and over geared. It's just an excuse for fury warriors to be relevant. Does it work? Yes. You can make any spec work in Classic. 
---
There are a few considerations to take into account when evaluating tank specs. First is gear vs spec. Deep prot doesn't make you any more 'tanky' than a hybrid spec. All of the mitigation talents are withing the first 15 (or 20) points. In practice, full deep prot and the arms 31/5/15 have the same mitigation. The 0/31/20 fury spec has near the same, but is missing 5% parry from arms. So when somone says something like "fury is just as tanky as prot ", they aren't exactly wrong, but this isn't the best way to look at the situation. The tankiness comes from your gear. If you need to be tanky, you're naturally going to run less DPS gear. When you are running a high mitigation set, prot threat is much better than fury threat because fury is so dependent on crit and AP. If you are able to run high DPS gear, fury DPS and threat will spike more than prot. 
---
The second consideration is what you are tanking. Fury has best Single Target DPS and (potentially) threat. But only single target environments. When pulling packs of mobs, arms hybrid or deep prot is better threat and DPS.
---
These considerations mean that for 5 man tanking, Deep prot or arms hybrid are going to be better than fury prot, with prot being the easier of the two. Fury tanking is specially for off tanking single targets in raid conditions.
---
The answer is right there but many refuse to see it. 🤷‍♂️
---
You’re only shackling if you’re fresh 60 or undergeared. Most groups are just going to pull without CC and the benefit of having a Mage will be very noticeable. I don’t think we even CC’d pre 60, you just kill the ghost dudes first.
---
Quartz
---
Just put some duct tape on it and get back in there. It'll be fine I swear.
---
only 3 raids? Surprisingly small amount from what I've seen. I saw pretty much a line of mages from thorium point all the way to the brm jump and then another several raids sitting down below. It's like a carpet of arcane explosion the entire way.
---
#"HAVE YOU TRIED TURNING IT OFF AND ON AGAIN?"
---
 ... Restart your damn game.
---
Rule No 2: Double tap
---
Right, but where was that guy before the honor release? Why the sudden uptick?
---
Second wind is still Pre-Raid Bis for healers imo. Briarwood has more +healing, but the 300 mana on use is way more valuable on long boss fights. Pare that with the DM trinket and you're good to go. Also the Shaman and Pally trinkets from DM are pretty bad anyway so Second Wind and Briarwood are definitely the way to go.
---
I do agree though that not doing golem saves a time of time. And if someone is willing to pay me  to heal just arena runs, seems fair to me! Grinding as a holy priest blows.
---
That i get.
---
Well good news. Hunters can solo so much content. DMT, mara, HoJ, SGC/Arena. Extremely lucrative, extremely fun.
---
Well raid dps isn't that great but eh. Just be the best hunt you can be
---
I would kill to have such a feature as well.
---
I was looking for pvp actually. Forgot to mention that.
---
Being able to detect someones buffs in stealth is more likely a problem with stealth and an unintended side effect but we wont know for sure until the creator of Spy clarifies. Considering how buggy stealth / feign death is atm though I am more inclined to think its a problem with that since pvp combat log parsers have existed for 15 years.
---
Pretty much the tweaks I posted.  Bracers, feet, shoulder shadow wrath BOEs up to +30 are BIS.  +29 versions are usually much cheaper on the AH and still otherwise BIS over named dungeon drops. 
---
Felcloth gloves are the biggest omission.  Kinda huge omission.  
---
Not mentioning Felheart pants at all for post-raid is odd since the +30 sp is barely behind the +34 on skyshroud and the stats almost make up for it on DPS in the simulator (it's equivalent to ~1.4 spellpower difference account for the big stat gains).  The other alternatives listed are far worse.

You should get on the warlock discord and download the spreadsheet because BiS can actually change based on your total gear set and buffs.  It is much more valuable, but you'll need some minimum level of savvy with Excel if you want to add your own items to it, it focuses almost entirely on (true) pre-BIS and raid BIS through phase 6 instead of pre-BIS and not-quite-pre-BIS stuff.   I still have the band of rumination for instance, which isn't on the spreadsheet, but I was able to add it.

There's literally a hundred postings of essentially the same meme every day.

You are correct,  little lopsided on some servers but better no honor at all then bgs.

Spoiler: the helm didn’t really decide the outcome as much as those two rogues being absolute dogshit did.

If you beat a Mage in DPS you severely out gear him or out skill him. Why is this so hard for people to understand? All things equal a Priest literally cannot our DPS a Mage who also has way more utility than a Shadow Priest.
---
I know. But now honor is in the game. Im just surprised people still camp the entrance so much.

Uhh good for you? Wtf is this post?

Everything okay? I don't get the hostility to all PvP players, especially since you play on a different server type.
---

---
Hm. Why are we not allowed to ask for changes to or voice complaints about the state of PvP? I played on PvP servers during Vanilla and BC and it was nothing like this, most likely because the average server now has several times the population of an average server 15 years ago.
---
This will actually make a difference between your current statement and countless other lies like that people made to vent off. As in would help not to discard it altogether.

I've always wanted an encounter that consists of Kael'thas and Kel'thuzad riding Onyxia and Nefarion and they all seek revenge for being repeatedly killed.
---
Yes. It will completely change when BGs release. Unfortunately, nobody has any idea how long it will be before that happens.
---
Retail players think that classic bgs are great until 30% of their team is afk botting honor and to hit top 100 you need 1 million plus. Yeah fun

Yeah i know. But seems high risk, low reward compared to camping closer to MC entrance.

Maybe there was another raid on the lower level, most of us just jumped at the window.
---
On Illidan during vanilla there was a slew of people right as the war effort was ra ping up and maybe a few months before hands that went to the extreme in PvP. From the funeral hank, to 5v5 nights in zones. Alot of people took pride in their ability to fight players competitively, not gank squads. 
---
I'll say last night our 10 to found some good fights. We got slaughtered a handful but also got some sweet group PvP in felwood and the ramp ti brm in burning steppes side.
---
It's a PvP server.
---
Shut up nerd.
---
I'm not saying it is easy. I'm not even saying I'm good at pvp and can take on multiples. I'm just saying the proof is out there that it is possible to outplay multiples.
---
Can confirm, as a healer there's 0 reason for me to do arena/angerforge runs outside of trying to get the healing trinket from golem lord.
---
At first when I read this I though I wrote it. Then I realized that my stranded priest is only 52 so you're definitely not me.
---
These things were never accurate.
---
At one point it said alliance outnumbered horde slightly on my server, and now it says it's almost dead even with a slight horde advantage
---
Yet any alliance who actually plays on the server would tell you horde outnumber them 2 to 1
---
My main is a warrior and I will always enjoy tanking, I wanted a pure DPS for fun. In original vanilla I played a mage, they have such amazing utility with porting but it is a little boring to go back to something I already did
---
If you want to start playing right now, you need to carefully weigh pros and cons for it and research your own server. 
---
I strongly suggest people who are weak-willed to join faction which is overwhelming on the realm they want to create their character at.
---
It's funny that the servers transfers on imbalanced servers are making the servers the people are transferring to imbalanced. Blizzard really need to address it.
---
We definitely needed this post.
---
Reminds me of China or a Black Mirror episode.
---
Tbc private servers had that problem going to crazy numbers like 90% horde.. And first server to do properly was netherwing made perfect sense server was 50/50 last time i played. But cant expect something so smart and professional from blizzard...
---
I specifically said it wouldn't stop that. 
---
"This does not stop the raid groups. But it would ensure that the statistically less populated faction could muster a much closer 1:1 defense/offense. Instead of the 3:1 or in some cases 12:1 that we are seeing today."
---
I can handle a 1v5. I can handle a 10v1.  What I cannot handle is a 200v40 while more than half of my faction is stuck in a queue. Guild Wars 2 launched their RvRvR with server specific queues so that a denser server did not have a distinct advantage. 
---
Why Blizzard hasn't done this and why the community isn't down their throat asking for it is pretty telling. The more populated faction just wants an easy game, but couldn't handle retail's log in everyday mentality (even though they are doing that now), because Horde has more players Blizzard would likely cater to them anyways (piss them off and lose more subs than if you piss off the Alliance). But also, this will incentivize server transfers for the weaker faction. We already know that Blizzard heavily discussed Classic on their last earnings call. It is not hard to connect the dots to see more monetization in Classic being Blizzard's ultimate goal.
---
Looks like you rolled PvE easy mode faction. Play Alliance as minority or stfu.
---
&gt;Why are people sad about PvP ... if they picked a PvP server? ... just play on a “normal server” and you are fine...
---
There's a difference between world pvp and kill squads. One is usually relatively fair and the better player tend to win more often. The other is completely one sided and is not enjoyable for either party. Do you see the difference?
---
Yeah, there is something new for you to learn every day.
---
:OOOO

---
Look up your stat priority as a warlock.  That will help you stay on track.  I believe any caster class ranks spirit low as you only regent via spirit if you don't cast 5 sec.  Where as int gives mana and crit chance and you have life tap to help manage your mana.

Honestly an iMac that old, taking GPU load like this, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was starting to go. Apple computers have never really been at a place to take much GPU load in the first place, but games like classic wow and Oldschool RuneScape should be fine as they were designed to be played on potatoes from 2004, with the exception of the new engine in classic that would most likely just require more RAM, and not a better GPU. 
---
However, I would look at updating the drivers for your graphics card. I don’t think apple does much of this if any in their system updates. Look up which GPU you have by clicking on the apple icon in the top left and click on About this a Mac, and then the system information window should pop up. Good the graphics card you have and “driver update”, and download that and see if it helps.

---
I agree that there is a strong argument for leaving it how it is right now, but Blizzard has showed with layering they are willing to play around with server structure in order to make the game playable. Faction-specific queues (if implemented properly - not just in the simplest way detractors can imagine them) could just be another example of this. Not changing the game, as such, but just changing how people access it.
---
Maybe this is why we need Classic+. I'd be more than happy if they introduced servers that moved forward from this "museum piece" idea using the design principles that make Classic so good (many of which were binned the first time around) but leaving some of the more dubious elements behind.
---

Poor guy couldn’t handle being ganked while leveling so he had to roll on a pve server
---
That's not true at all, for 3 reasons.
---
1) There is no Spy to hunt people down
---
2) Alliance weren't as likely to pvp, so the complaints were nowhere near as frequent
---
3) Servers were much smaller back then
---
Only dying 2-3 times to get into BRD sounds like a utopia lol

Exit battle.net. Restart your computer if you're not sure how to do that. It's working for everyone else, so excuse me if I think it will work for you too.
---
I also played since beta and I’m not wrong at all. Perhaps you had a different experience than I did, on a different set of servers, with a different opinion of what it meant to pvp, but that does neither make my experience false, nor does it make yours false. 
---
You are correct that faction imbalance can be more or less exaggerated with the way Blizzard is managing the server populations, and I’m not marginalizing that fact either, but the mentality of people complaining now is exactly the same as it was then.
---
Playing back then I would see people roll-out two raids deep and camp entire zones. The people getting camped would complain on the server forums and decry the lack of ability to turn-in quests because NPCs were dead or to make it out of the zone because flight paths were aggro’d and there were 10-20 rogues ready to kill-on-sight anyone that approached them. Eventually a counter attack would happen somewhere or the campers would inevitably get bored. The point, though, is that was what happened on a pvp server (or at least the ones I played on: Korgath, Kil’Jaeden, Spirestone, and Tichondrius) and being surprised or angry about it was futile, because why else would someone play on a pvp server? “Git gud or transfer/reroll” as they said back then. 
---
That was how it was then and it’s the same now. It’s the vanilla experience, minus quality-of-life improvements such as battlegroups and connected realms. The only difference, as you already pointed out, is there are more people to complain about it now than back then.
---
Complaining now is simply repeating the past and it further emphasizes my initial point: people thought they wanted this, but they actually don’t, and the ass-pain they’re experiencing is comedy to me because of this developing cycle.
---
Yeah I get your point, but pure dps have lost many fights due to healers in the backline. You wont get mercy. Perhaps you should in a 1v1
---
"Horde are going to dominate everywhere" is only wrong for how many servers as a %? Maybe 5% tops.
---
It says its biggest chance is like .4 off onyxia so I'd say itll fetch a high price.  You got extremely lucky and found it at one of the more rare locations.  I'd say it's easily worth 200g on my server.  Considering the amount of people with greater fire protection potions vs those and greater recipe goes for 190-200 on mine
---
No you’re in fact quite wrong lol. 60 content is not as fun. Especially in classic. Classic is about the journey, not end game.  Retail is what you’re thinking of.
---
I’m just really confused ... didn’t world pvp exist in classic? Why would people go on a pvp server if they didn’t want this?
---
they kept repeating "we do not dispute bans" over and over, Ill open another ticket.

ur cool
---
i was there - he kicked the people who died because they couldn't partake in the raid for 15 mins due to a boss debuff, and they died like 3 secs into the fight. People get kicked from raids all the time, normally that doesn't precipitate the kicked person getting all the loot and distributing it to whoever he wants.
---
This doesn't make sense, there are tons of people who play with two or more accounts from the same computer.
---
You have an awful lot to prove to strangers on the internet.
---
Don't use recount.  Use Details! and set it for effective time, not activity time.   It will give you a *much* clearer picture of what's going on.   You can also setup an account on warcraftlogs, log your raid, and upload a personal log and see what's going on there as well in even more detail.
---
There's no getting our shit together, man. No one wants to PVP. And that's fine. I just want to xfer, and this didn't answer my question.
---
Is it related to your pet? Maybe when you have a pet out the bar gets pushed up due a pet hotbar or something.
---
Definitely. I played a few of em some years ago. Kinda surprised it can exist in WoW.
---
Something like this, but anyway if it is the same % slow then I found I can still kite the warriors until poison runs out.
---
&gt; Yes you must be the single one person to ever figure that out?
---
I never claimed I was the only person to figure it out, nor that one needs to have a vast intellect to figure it out. 
---
My point is not that I am particularly smart or insightful, my point is that everyone who disregarded the warnings, rolled on a PvP-server and is now complaining that wPvP is little more than senseless ganking (something that has been very well known for about 15 years) is moron who had it coming.
---
It's particularly pathetic when they blame Blizzard for their own stupids decision. And while I find all the whining somewhat amusing and satisfying, ultimately you either have either suck up or pay up (once transfers become available).
---
I think Blizzard should open a fresh PvE-server for all unsatisfied the PvP-Server players to transfer to. Maybe they can name it "The Shortbus" or something.
---
Your attention span equals that of a 5 year old. Congrats.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? Like wtf.
---
Math is correct.  Implications, assumptions and conclusions might be wrong.
---
BF and SnD together are a x1.6 attack speed boost.  Berserking, best case, 10s every 180s, gets that up to 2x.
---
That's unlikely though since healers will not agree to keep you at very low health.  They'll maintain you at &gt;90% health so you'll be getting the +10% attack speed boost most of the time, not +30%.  Even when in a raid environment where your health is dipping frequently, it's completely RNG as to whether you get +10%, +20% or +30%.  In my testing, I felt lucky to get 20%.  Worse is that when my health was dipping low enough to get +20%/+30% it was a good indication that our healer couldn't keep up and it was not the best time to be increasing my DPS.
---
Regardless, if Berserking is popped every time it's up, average white damage will increase +0.5% at the expense of energy, combo points, luck and focus.  You can increase that to +1.7% white damage if you can consistently get your health below 30% when the racial is ready.
---
Now the question is, does the loss of energy and combo points offset the white damage gain.  In my testing, yes.  
---
Using my racial dropped my DPS.
---
My Horde guild transferred from Stalagg to Heartseeker last Friday. Almost all of us are loving it. Sure, it sucks when multiple smaller alliance groups come together and camp my group - but that only happens every 1-2 hours. Other than that, my group of 3-10 is just running around fighting smaller alliance groups of the same size. We just stay away from major towns and flight paths and we are good. Transferring to Heartseeker was honestly the best decision we could have made. The game is really fun for me right now.
---
For a night elf rogue, what are the odds I'm gonna be detected while using Stealth on an enemy territory like Orgrimmar?
---
Yes I am jelly actually.  I wish they offered pvp&gt;pve transfers.
---
I played pvp private servers and it wasn't too bad so I rolled pvp on classic and trying to level alts is pissing me off to no end.
---
This one is easy to understand: they just don't want to deal with the social interaction
---
I played it over 1000hrs and I think I never made a Human Leather Hat.

Ah, more evidence to support my initial claim.
---
I’ve actually had this happen to me aswell, just in WC3 Where i also recieved 24 hour Ban, after writing to blizzard they also couldn’t tell me Why i was banned, but i just had to sit it out, pretty odd
---
I've said for two years that they should balance faction signups on servers or use some other method to ensure balance (such as faction specific queues).
---
I've said for two years that they should have had Whitemane 1, Whitemane 2, Whitemane 3, etc... with a shared name pool and proper populations and then merged the segments when/if they needed merging. 
---
I'm just a dude in the middle of the USA who would have run this game much better than professionals. It's quite frustrating seeing people like you ask what Blizzard should have done when the solutions were obvious and frequently repeated in forums.
---
Yay I was mean to someone!!

Which means everyone else is quickly going to get bored of ganking for hours every day and slow down

Snagged Standing 450 / Rank 3 and a half on Whitemane Horde with 27k honor. I didn't even feel like I played that much, mostly zerged in Hillsbrad for a while and did some solo PVP in Winterspring. I don't think the honor caps during this phase are going to be very high.
---
So you’re bragging about something that you didn’t even figure out on your own?
---
You are correct, I just want to add that you are only competing with people who have 15+ HKs. So people who are just standing around in towns or are playing on pve servers without flagging themselves do not count towards that and don't lower the percentiles in favor of you.
---
30,000+ is an extreme exaggeration. On Herod (one of the most populated servers), I'm about 90% through R3, so ~9500 RP, which according to the wiki is somewhere in the neighborhood of top 3%. This is standing 135. So we can guess there are 135 / 0.03 = 4500 people who got at least 15 HKs on my faction.
---
That's what Wowhead says. Experience in the world dictates otherwise. From what I've come to understand the Wowhead stats reflect total accounts, not active accounts.
---
umhm sure. what ever you say man. hey should you be in school right now?
---
You spank it you tank it.  If I have threat or a taunt, cool, if not, I have zero qualms letting a DPS tank until I can get it back, they can pop a cooldown or something.

Literally why I stopped playing classic, the thing that made classic great - the ability for the community to be a community, is just not there due to the ultra toxic elitist mentality that things like M+ and loot on rails has been fermenting for the past decade. At first you didn't see it in every corner, but even the ones that wanted classic to be about the people eventually have either quit or succumbed and allowed this poisonous BS to twist their perspective as well.
---
It's all good, man. I'm not upset, I just want to transfer to a server where Horde actually pvps.
---
huh theres a shitton of outrage lmao.
---
You're excused. Not only does this solution make no sense, since the updates are happening server side, but multiple people HAVE tried this. It does not and cannot fix this issue.
---
Time to level fishing...
---
the staff thing is a joke after jokerd ninja’d it
---
Most of us on PVP servers don't have an issue with the current environment. We were raised in that environment. Does the higher pop make it worse? Sure. Is it unplayable? Nah. You're hearing from a very vocal minority of folks who should never have rolled on PVP servers. You rolled on a pve server and I'm happy for you. Most of us on the pvp side are happy too.
---
I thought the "clown suits" were from tBC, not vanilla...

Deep prot is for tanks who like to have more control over what happens in the pull. It is not a trap. A properly geared prot tank can generate enough threat to keep agro in any 5 man, as well as having extra tools just for the extra control. Again, this is for 5 mans with the potential of pugs. Try to tank a pug DM run as fury and you're not going to have a good time. Also everything dies so fast in 5 mans, you don't have time to benefit from the 'higher threat generation of fury' which is mostly a myth anyway.
---
With that being said, in a raid situation that is all or nearly all guild run,  fury prot can make sense.
---
Imagine if Blizzard only allowed cross-realm BG's to small population realms, then both sides would cry of imbalance. Though World PvP would become even more cancer.

Fun facts: if anyone listened to the commentary track on this episode (Make Love Not Warcraft), apparently an unknown player popped up on Blizzard's private server while they were trying to stage a lot of the the in-game scenes.  One of the Blizzard employees killed the player with his GM powers and then the team went on a long, philosophical, debate on whether or not it's OK to kill players in cold blood.  Apparently, this is where the idea for the bad guy being able to "kill the admins" was born.
---
TrinketMenu and ItemRack are must-haves for this reason
---
&gt; I played pvp private servers and it wasn't too bad
---
Playing on a private server (Kronos) has actually been the final nail in my decisions to absolutely not roll on a PvP servers. Getting casually one-shotted by a hunter running by or having 3 level 60 rogues completely depopulating Redridge just seemed so god-damn pointless to me. 
---
In 19 out of 20 cases, PvP was simply getting ganked, murdered by a bored lvl 60 or killed while fighting a mob. This just didn't seem like compelling gameplay to me.
---
He screams boldly into the echo chamber.
---
Bravo.
---
Even Sulfurus, an ostensibly balanced server, is a death run to every instance above ST level.
---
And generally people assume pvp to mean you have the opportunity to fight other people trying to quest in similar areas, and yes, getting ganked occasionally. Not constantly ganked by mobs of players 10+ levels higher than you in full raid gear. Your comment is deliberately ignoring the spirit of what I'm asking, and that's \*obvious\*.
---

I appreciate your comment.

If nothing else, Phase 2 has been incredibely divisive, which is terrible for the community. No matter what side of the fence you land on in regards to WPVP and how its been handled, you have to admit it won't end up being healthy for the games population, which is a shame.
---
&gt;Tell me how you would have predicted that **heartseeker** would be the only pvp server that is alliance dominated. I'll wait.
---
Remember, I'm asking you specifically about heartseeker. How would you have predicted that?
---
Then stop posting about pvp issues lol on day one of phase 2 on a pvp server. Do you see us complaining that pver are not engaging in fights as often as they should? NO.

Besides everybody I mean.

Horde outnumber alliance in almost every battle group. Most horde are pvpers, most alliance do not care about pvp at all,  hence the state of the sub. If alliance do bgs it's usually for bis items from av. The alliance numbers don't accurately affect bgs.
---
Nah it’s pretty shit system. Even the developers admitted that by overhauling it in the first expansion.

Suddenly wanting to go yell at Randy on a new playthrough.
---
I mean to say, saying you are trying to be rank 1 out of 30k is an exaggeration. You are only competing vs your own faction, and only against people who get at least 15 HKs. As you can see from my proof, on Herod Horde this is currently somewhere around 4500 people.

BiS bracers is 21, there is not 29/30 sp bracers,also u want t2 legs not t1 since that gives 30sp and 1crit, so u dont want to use the legs for the 3 piece t1 bonus and wrist is the only spot u can swap for that bonus.
---
also crit is good it is not worth 14sp at the current gear level (it completely depends on your total sp u have, crit becomes much more valuable when u have higher sp)
---
Where are you getting that number? According to wowhead Kurinaxx is 59% horde.
---
As a warlock I find that most players wait a bit for me to pop soulstone before they leave. Sometimes, even if I don't have ss, I'll wait for a bit to release spirit just to waste their time.
---
And it’s only been 1 week! No wonder retail turned out the way it did, people complain so loudly about a PLAINLY STATED FEATURE OF THE GAME! My god imagine if Blizzwrd came out with a server where you didn’t have to worry about wpvp!
---
I need to roll a Human hunter.
---
merging two unbalanced pvp horde favored servers won't solve anything, only PVE servers have alliance dominant numbers, and now as a horde on a pve server I have to pay the price for millions of idiots making horde on pvp servers running up my queues with xrealm
---
I don’t know what sort of answer you expected with this kind of post
---
Nice i checked again about 15 minutes ago will check again after work
---
I restarted my pc. Still no honor. Should I have let my pc sit off for longer? Like come on man.
---
Amazing quest and super rewarding once complete. I shared the same  struggle and initial disappointment you did, but once you get that first demon down you regain confidence and push! You nailed it. 
---
I did Klinfran -&gt; Simone -&gt; Arturious -&gt; Solenar. I definitely died at least 25 times on Solenar before caving in and using COR. 
---
Grats on your staff and bow!
---
What happened?? Have alot of people stopped playing since phase 2 launched? My PC broke so I haven't been online for the last week

Step one: Bubble

“Ok boomers” - followed by one complete run on sentence with an arbitrary percentage listed as fact. You, sir, are the reason why us millennials catch such a bad rap and get laughed at for using the term “okay, boomer”. 
---
Stop playing wow and go back to elementary school. Please.
---
Horde has always historically been favored on PVP servers. Combine that with the giant populations, all the signs were there, people just didn't see them.
---
*there’s always a slow fade out in a montage....*
---
I dont see how that's relevant to the conversation.  Heartseeker wasnt even a launch day realm so of course it would have been impossible to predict.
---
Yeah, can't deny that
---
I have only seen people upset about what's going on and not any actual solutions being discussed yet. What is it that makes this on Blizzard and not on the players, and/or what can they do to fix it? Sry if this sounds kind of snarky, but it's a serious question
---
To anyone reading this, anecdotal evidence isn't a good way to judge if you will get banned or not.  
---
It IS against the ToS to use an application like this to change models, so if you wish to use something like this, don't complain if your account gets perma-banned.  
---
Use at your own risk.
---
Horde will still massively gank in the world because they have to supplement honor during long ques. There's little difference between how much honor horde pugs and premades  earn, because horde pugs win almost every game.
---
No, your pet does not inherit any enchants from your gear nor does it receive stat scaling from your own base stats. As far as I'm aware the only things you may equip that directly impact pets are trinkets that explicitly state that they improve your pet, and the tier set bonus that grants your pet more resistances and stamina.
---
It’s one of those matchups where you have to hope they make a mistake, it’s not impossible but you HAVE to capitalize on their mistakes
---
We hosted an MC Pug and run in from burning steppes. Along the way we lost 4 people. All you need to do is have the deathball spread out to not get sappered while waiting for res. Once inside just go left and jump off the bridge into the lava and then lava jump to the window to zone into MC. That jump alone we lost 4 people but they were able to res, run off and then zone in.
---
No time stamps I call BS
---
Why is that?
---
Yup
---
I believe your looking for weakauras. I havent reinstalled it since I got into classic but I believe there is a classic version. From what I remember you can define your own triggers, such as riposte being active, and have it display something on screen. Someone correct me if I’m wrong.
---
I somewhat agree. The entire problems comes down to overpopulation in my opinion. I don't mind people camping paths to an instance or FP to farm honor. My only real issue is that once you get past that group you have to go through another directly behind them. And then another. And another. It used to be an obstacle to getting to a dungeon. Now it's an impassable barrier for hours or more at a time. Just isn't fun. I'm spending my time solo farming dm:e and plan to raid log until BGs when I get my epic mount.
---
Well, if you get the drop and manage a charge the mage is already goofing up. Charge has a 25 yard range, improved frost bolt is 36 yards. A r1 frost bolt should tag the warrior from a distance and prevent the charge. 
---
But if you manage to sneak up on a mage, they should still win if they don't panic. Mages should never Blink away after the Frost Nova. Just strafe away. They need to save Blink for Intercept. 
---
Then Ice Block the Intimidating Shout. 
---
If a mage panics and wastes Blink, you've got a shot but a decent mage never will.
---
&gt;Why did you sign up for this specific YMCA when you were aware that in 3 months there were going to be NBA players mercilessly dunking on you?
---
Gottem. Another idiot down, this is really too easy.
---
What's there to reply to? Your personal attacks? You actually expecting a serious reply to that? ROFL.
---
It’s Rogue, not Rouge.  Rouge is the French word for Red.
---
Oh you mean people PVP on PVP servers? Odd.
---
I stopped reading at Ret Paladin. I stopped reading because I found the problem.
---
Main is 60 and the alt I play the most is 48.
---
It mostly is though.
---
Incorrect. No issue with more than one account imon a single PC.
---
Tell the real story.
---
Idea is to corpse camp you for an easy kill when you rez, people keep breaking cc's so it's easier just to kill and camp... Not that I would ever take part in such abhorrent behaviour...
---
Horned viking helmet and neatplates.
---
How did you get me?
---
They overhaul everything in each expansion. Must all be bad
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
---
To be honest I had no idea they increased the server cap. My mates decided on Gehennas well before other servers were announced, so we sticked with it.
---
idk it fixed queue issues in the past when they originally released cross realm battlegroups.
---
If the guards can't get to you, it's called safespotting and you could get banned/suspended if reported enough.
---
Wait, two trinkets?
---
You might run into the issue where the addon is used as a way to communicate with the opposite faction. I'm sure that's not your intent. You might want to consider how you could combat this if it concerns you, such as a 15 minute delay or something.
---
Will I get my account suspended?
---
C'mon really? You really didn't know PvP was going to be forced on you in a PvP server even when you don't want it?
---
Sure okay....
---
What's a palladin?
---
It's literally explainedin the episode. He leveled up so much he could gank anyone without having to agree to a duel.  not even the GMs could stop him
---
I don't know how you've lived long enough to learn to type without learning empathy. Goodbye.
---
The delusional goal of Rank 14 is laughable. I don't think people understand just how much they'll have to play to get it.
---
LOL OP you’re completely short sighted and delusional.
---
Christ this whole conversation seems very dramatic. I did zf the other day as hpriest with a dps specced balance druid in bear form, an arms warrior, a rogue of some description and a lock, all of us bar one were under level 50 (all 47 and 48)  the rogue was 52. We decided we didn't need a tank, we'd just go in and give it a try and it was fine. Nobody died, didn't take that long. I don't see why that should have been such a big deal and I think quizzing people before going in a dungeon is way over dramatic.
---
Yeah its not like I never had to go for Cannibalism to survive a rough winter. If I start in a Cold Biome where I don't have much time to stockpile food for the Winter its pretty much the only way to survive unless you get lucky and a Manhunter Pack of huge easily killable animals attacks.
---
Back in Vanilla my Boyfriend would come over and play on my computer with his account and there was never an issue. Of course that was Vanilla. It seems like the classic moderators are the fucking worst this time around.
---
Sounds like you didn't think through playing on a PvP server.
---
I’m confused as to what you’re asking; you can still trigger leeway without back pedal bound, you turn around and then you can trigger it by attacking and strafing as the game registers you as “moving”. 
---
Or did you mean you do NOT want leeway to be triggered ?
---
Doesn’t change faction hostilely
---
Such generalizations, maybe you just don't like classic wow
---
Haha nice what addon are u using for your character/target health?
---
They don't want BGs for easy honor farming.  That part is not going to change.  We want BGs because world PvP with honor but without BGs is shite as fuck and BGs are fun.
---
ITT: I'm smort cuz pve
---
For most horde, P2 probably feels like a slightly more dangerous PvE server.
---
I was farming felcloth. Suddenly lvl 60 ally mage arrives running asay from 3 mobs. I pull all 3 mobs on me, and continue to kill them. He helps me woth it, i send him /salute. 
---
A minute later, 4 of his companions arrive and remain on their mounts. I do nothing. Suddenly, lvl 60 warr charges me, mage freezes me, and nukes me down. While im dead, he sends /salute.
---
No more being kind from me. War is on.
---
Btw Peralta-Flamelash if you're reading this, fuck you.
---
I think the post is genuine, but made by a vicious troll twat.
---
I always kill their pets if they are opposite faction. They usually bug out and stop reviving after 7 or 8 times in a row.
---
Then how long does it take for you? Charge + Sweeping strikes is pretty much instant, second part depends on number of mobs attacking you (how fast rage comes in). Typically ~3 seconds for me.
---
RealMobHealth
---
Generally I think my realm has been pretty balanced. It only started up with the implementation of honor, which sounds like it will be sick if I either make it to 60 or re-roll and play around my level. Thanks for your answer.
---
Story
---
It's gonna be real healthy for my in game currency though having all these people drop off or only sign on for raid nights. Meanwhile i'm out farming and selling resources still. 
---
I've already noticed it's waaaaaaay easier to farm materials in the world since Honor dropped. Probably a mix of people are too busy pvping, people don't want to go out into the zones for fear of getting deathsquaded, or people are just straight up not playing as much as they were. The demand for the resources has not gone down at all though from what i've seen.
---
Those talents have to specifically say you and your pet. If it only says you, or only says your pet, it only applies to the one.
---
As far as gear and enchants and buffs, nothing that happens to only you affects your pet and visa versa.
---
The game pretty much treats your pet as another player for everything but how it's controlled, and specific talents that you can buff your pet with.
---
That can't be a reason honestly. My gf and I use 2 computers and we switch sometimes. 1 is PC 2nd is laptop so whatever we do sometimes one use notebook, sometimes the other and same goes with PC. Furtermore, sometimes she travles to her parents and uses their pc to play.
---
What is it about RP-PvP servers?
---
I say fuck it.
---
Break whatever add-ons you must to kill the spy add-on.
---
Classic bgs are fun for 1 day.
---
This was when MC was new.  We had 0 MC Gear, but we were pretty 55+ gear sets.  we were feral druid, warrior, holy pally.  Resto druid, warrior, rogue, etc.  I'm 100% sure you guys can do it with a shaman healer.  The biggest issue would be the fire elementals.  Which your shaman has FR totem, so it'll be fine.
---
You’ll take anything you can get, except the option that has been in your control since day 1?
---
Ohhh I see. You're just trolling any post that's a complaint and telling people they're bitches. You really are cool.
---
This is the sad truth of the matter. The casuals and non-pvpers on pvp servers benefit the most from everyone else going berserk in the world. I got a fair bit of honor done last week, got my trinket today, and was back farming some RTVs while deathsquads cleared out any farming competition.
---
Thanks! 🙏
---
and I'm using neatplates, it's super clean
---
Cool.
---
You can hire gank squads anywhere to protect you and kill your competition. Im surprised more people don't offer the services.
---
I mean in Vanilla, you KNEW who was going for GM on both sides, horde and alliance, just from the frequency that you saw them in the BG's. And you are correct, the higher ranks tended to group together, partially to keep everyone's honor straight (no cap breakies). I only got to tag along because I ran around healing them. I can't imagine how its going to be with like quadruple the people.
---
Why am I not getting honor for some kills? I've been following someone (both 60) for over a minute, so he clearly couldn't have the honorless target buff. I kill him, clearly get the killing blow, but no honor message appears.
---
that's the reverse in my server.
---
I think Gnome intellect is to total not base.
---
New 5-man instance only on PvP servers: The Sunken Cost
---
That's a great question, sure, but there's absolutely no way for us to know how many people are having a blast and not to posting online about it. I forget how the saying goes, but we're more likely to share bad experiences than good ones.
---
Tank dungeons.
---
I just wish they had an over the should arrow quiver for my hunter.
---
Why would you need balance on a PVE server anyway?
---
Which is........?
---
Warlock is great. I can solo almost any elite, 1v1 almost any class, and top dps meters on raid bosses. If you have shards and a pet, you're like a little demi-god.
---
Don't even simplify it with a minority vs. majority approach.  Even on my server that is 50/50 roughly the game is unplayable unless you want to ride around in 10 and 20 person groups looking for PVP.
---
I am level 60 and it took me over an hour to get one quest done in Blasted Lands of all places yesterday.  I was ganked at least 5 times during that stretch - and it's not even PVP honestly as you can't win going 1 against 4 or 1 against 5.
---
Literally the only options if you are trying to quest right now is trying to convince 5 or 10 other people to come do the same quests you are or you have to go live in dungeons - which take 30-60 minutes to get to because it's a corpse run the entire way.
---
Subscriptions will dry up if this stays and all the PVP bros are going to be stuck on dead servers running around waving at each other finding nothing to kill.  Shit - I am level 60 and am not enjoying my game time and even though I am raiding and already clearing Ony and MC - seriously thinking about whether to renew because I work a full time job and have 2-3 hours each night to play and now I can't even fit a dungeon run in sometimes because it takes an hour to get a full group to a dungeon because of all the corpse running - not to mention the griefers that try to kill people in a way that registers as a PvE death (mind controlling into Lava or off walls, etc...) so players end up arriving at a dungeon at 50-60% armor already.
---
PVP is broken in the current state.  They either need to reduce server pops or roll out BGs and I am not even sure either of those will completely fix it.
---
I died nine times running my Priest to the MC Portal area at 10:30am server time. Somehow I doubt our raid is going to start on time tonight...
---
Mom! Bathroom!
---
I can understand anxiety dealing with hagglers (some of them lowball so bad it's not even worth responding to them), but if someone is willing to buy something for more than you're willing to sell it for, there is no haggling, just sell it to them at their asking price and make that sweet extra profit. I even specify that I'll buy COD so they can just mail it and dont even have to /invite me
---
How do you open a ticket for reporting someone though? If you try to, it just tells you to use the right click report, which is pretty useless if the person is gone. Most of the Open a Ticket options lead to a help article, not actually opening a ticket.
---
Why do you think they attacked the grey?
---
Your percentile ranking is based on everyone else of your class rankings at the time of your log. The reason your % is dropping down is because you arn't the only one getting more gear and doing better each week.
---
So while your damage may be improving, you are not improving at the rate of others.
---
Also judging dps performance in raids is the most reliable as there is a finite amount of damage to be done to a boss, where as healing requirements sometimes may double or triple depending on mistakes made etc.
---
Did they though? They spent days &amp; days &amp; days of their lives that they won’t ever get back, running a race only the 0.01% will finish. And on the Flip side of that coin, the less alliance/horde their are to oppose you, the more one sided the server becomes. As more people leave &amp; stop playing that snowball only grows. Eventually the disappointments &amp; set backs become a catalyst or reminder of why you won’t sit down and try again. Furthering the disparity to be even more one sided. So you’re right, they succeeded in what they set out to do. But what does that accomplish in the long run.
---
Just tossing in my experience here - go with highest dps weapon as you're levelling, just to make things easier and less complicated, as you'll not need to min/max until late game.
---
BM was significantly easier to level as, I tried both. BM seems to just have higher survivability in general, and your pet actually packs a bit of a punch. MM and slow weapons are much more important at max level when you're trying to completely maximize your damages.
---
I used Hurricane from 48-60 and it did me just fine, only switched to a 2.9+ weapon speed crossbow once I started raiding.
---
I was first mage to do this on my server and got about 25 patterns while they were worth 100g-150g.  Now they are under 50g so it really isn't worth it compared to other farms out there.
---
Both iirc.
---
They've clearly stated that server caps are much much higher than vanilla. I can't be arsed to look it up no but it's certain.
---
Ty :)
---
Damage done is irrelevant, and you will get a ton of kills if you play right. Your whole gameplan is surprise, burst damage, and speed, why would you expect to be running into the middle of a bunch of warriors and fighting head-to-head? Cheating to secure kills is basically the entire flavor of your class.
---
What server?
---
Who did I personally attack? You called me a cunt in your very first posting in the thread and every single posting of yours after that was attacking me personally as well. So I guess me drinking sweet PvPer tears really hit a sore spot with you, didn't it?
---
Fights aren’t long in AQ either, and since they are short but healing intensive mp5 generally does fuck all. Better off with +healing and manapots/runes on CD and even a flask if it’s bad.
---
Generally, fights are being made harder by guilds just sucking. You can negate all damage in AQ with poison resistance elixirs, yet this sub will tell you resto shamans make it “so easy” for horde.
---
If you kept up the same progress week to week &amp; accounted for greater decay, this would put you in rank 11 or 12 or so. R14 is the top .3% of ranked players, I think R13 is like 2%. Frostshawk is right in that the grind will get out of hand, but as shocking as it may sound this will be the easiest time to get R14 excluding AV release, because the total number of ranked players will be at its height
---
They should have rolled on a pve server then in the first place. But I don't think what you're suggesting will actually happen. I sure do wish Blizz would do something to make it more balanced, with say 60/40 as the max imbalance or even 55/45. That said, I think a vocal minority are just not used to getting griefed/killed in games like this these days and were blindsided by it. You're pretty salty about pvp servers when you don't play on one and I find that fairly odd. I mean I guess if people called you names for not rolling pvp and then those same folks are bitching about pvp servers I get it. A lot of us who rolled pvp knew what we were getting into though. I have no problem with folks who play and prefer pve. I think people who didn't realize they wanted to be on a pve server fucked up though. I'm glad that you're where you want to be.
---
This sounds like it does the same thing as [Personal Shopper](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/personal-shopper) but with a gui.
---
How is this different than people despawning demons on the hunter rhok quest.  That isn't something you can get banned for.
---
You could have no spec and still run dungeons and quest.
---
Look at overall damage done, not dps. It's the best metric for how useful a dps is in the raid. 
---
DPS means nothing if you have large downtime.
---
Before the crowd gets here and tells you how to play:
---
You are a mage, it's super hard to make the wrong decision, and it will impact you less than you think.
---
It’s not optimal but you’ll be more than fine :)
---
and then wait the 3days + for a response.
---
yes.
---
Would you feel better if every post on reddit had an automatic "The following my opinion:" prefix?
---
Also AoE mage is very good for everything.
---
You're making unfounded assumptions. Alliance on pvp servers do care about pvp. It was even enough in the past post battlegroups to have fast queues on both sides so I don't understand where your getting the idea that pvp battlegroups will have a 10/3 horde/alliance ratio doing BGs today.
---
I've seen the exact same thing and I assume it's because you've killed the same player too many times? I was pretty sure even diminished honor kills still show in the log though but It's the only conclusion I could come to because it happened twice this weekend where I took someone 100-0 and got no honor for it.
---
[Wrecking Ball] anal.
---
Questing/farming at all is nearly impossible on my server.
---
i'm on fairbanks and the best data we can get on it says it's a 2/1 horde/ally ratio.   and it fucking shows.   every FP is camped. 
---
every quest hub. it's just non stop camping.   
---
can't get anything done when the server population is that far out of balance.
---
If you have an engineer in your party it may just be easier keeping a repair bot with the group!
---
That's incredibly stupid if that's the case.
---
Everyone just ignore /u/CmMozzie he is a known stalker on reddit, and harasses users for no reason. Sad!
---
It’s better at both of those things than single target, until endgame where you may run a frost/arcane hybrid, or go back into a single-target winters frost talent build. In dungeons, your AoE damage is heavily desired and borderline necessary in some cases to make dungeons much easier.

It’s useless currently and will remain useless for a long time. What fights during the next year will ever be long enough - or what gear can you even stack up - to get any value from MP5 as a paladin?
---
Kirtonos

&gt;it was very rare and considered a serious issue for the people of your faction to address in general
---
Go home man, you're drunk
---
No, it’s not. I’m in fact quite right
---
I think RTC tracks rolls that other in raid does. My addon is just for doing /roll 40 and getting the correct name for that result.
---
The problem is that theres just more horde than alliance on pvp servers in general. Eventually the horde is going to run out of places to go without a long as queue unless they implement a free faction change.
---
If you have another aoe dps partner youll be fine in a dungeon.

I mean this is just flat wrong. Maybe for raiding but most specs have different builds for the different activities and some even have different specs based on the fight. Classic on the other hand essentially has 1-2 specs per role per class.

Mega servers aren't vanilla.
---
It sucks because this is the right idea. WOW is a game of two warring factions that should kill each other on sight. But... I just want to fucking level and probably should have gone to a normal server.
---
These responses have been weak guys. This guy says he isn’t good at pvp and he’s willing to fight dirty. He’s looking for CHEATER SHIT!  
---
You need to find a second warlock, pay him to hide in a bush, duel you before your duel with your son, and put curse of recklessness on you, mitigating the need to stance dance and zerker to avoid fear. Only coil will still function since it’s a horrify effect. 
---
Also will this be televised on twitch?
---
Thanks Moe! Will tell them to keep it down next time. ;)
---
Haha for fucks sake. Keep reading your own link. You took it out of context. They don't wanna raise the cap based on the ALREADY RAISED CAP. 
---
Also if you actually read your own link further down it stays :
---
"Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity – a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006."
---
Now go home.
---
I don't have one. I just stopped.
---
No one ever truly quits WoW..... 
---
But in all seriousness, I think there is a lot of whining happening right now, but the reality is the amount of people who will actually quit playing is not going to be huge. 
---
I think the people who might actually quit playing are those people who were brand new to the game, and ended up on a PvP server for whatever reason (not understanding what it meant really, friends, etc) and if they are not 60 yet and don't have a lot of time to dedicate to the game it may not seem worth it to them to reroll on a PvE server or wait it out for BGs to come out.
---
I think there will and already has been a lot of people who are playing less. People only logging in for raid times, or doing the occasional dungeon run. There will always be a range of players, with huge influxes of people riding the "content waves". Maybe some will "quit" now cause they don't like the content, but lots will come back for the next wave.

Hunter decide to hard cast 10 feet from rogue with a mob on him...

This is actually one of the interactions that were used as an argument to keep spell batching as it is.
---
Removing spell batching would either nerf EM shamans, or it would require some kind of modification to EM to make up for losing it.

Mages scale amazing into Naxx though lol
---
You guys are being a bit dramatic, lol
---
is it bannable to try and fuck up same faction world boss kills? cause if that is true then I got some competition on my server to get banned.
---
I played during classic and during private servers,  the que times were not the same.

Lol no need to respond. We didn't kick any guildies. Why would we? We don't have a responsibility to the other players who died right away and added nothing to the raid.
---
You don't understand. They're IN GOLDSHRIE TOO. IT'S EVERYWHERE.
---
Joking aside, watching that episode, I fully expected Cartman to join the griefer and kill his friends.
---
It’s two sides of the same coin in the same asshole.
---
Wouldn't they be working as intended if he's seeing things better than they were?
---
Orc warr speccing into extra stun resist makes rogue-fights hilarious.
---
&gt; I mean I guess if people called you names for not rolling pvp and then those same folks are bitching about pvp servers I get it.
---
Yeah, the general attitude of this sub's hivemind towards PvE-Servers and PvE-players has been pretty shitty, so getting a bit of payback is kinda fun. It's like poetic justice or something.
---
You must've gotten falsely reported for something. 
---
I doubt that was automated.
---
What a cunt of a response.
---
"80/20 server and they still cheat"
---
I have yet to be even attacked since the change.
---
Mad cuz bad thus sad.
---
Currently world PvP is literally the worst PvP experience ever produced by WoW.  Pre-honor and post-BG world PvP was and will be great -- not better or worse than BGs or arenas but great in its own right -- but the world PvP happening *right now* is god fucking awful.  The only people who enjoy the current state of affairs are PvE players who will jump on any grinding treadmill and sociopaths.  No one who enjoys competitive gaming is happy with how PvP is right now.
---
Ha ha wow, when you put it that way, it makes him sound like he would have had to be a former developer that put backdoors into the game for himself, or something.
---
As someone who played in a wpvp dedicated guild in Vanilla and did a lot of pvp in BC, the current situation is significantly different due to how much larger the average server is. For example, the active 60 population of *one faction* on my 52/48 server is two or three times larger than the *entire population* of the Vanilla PvP server I played on.
---
They enjoy doing it along the way and that’s frankly all that matters. That’s why any of us play games
---
Well, I am a-*head* of the game.
---
I'm with the other guy. i was on a horde heavy server in vanilla and loved the pvp. 
---
this is completely different than anything I saw in vanilla. 
---
and the "git gud or transfer" doesn't work when blizz just locked down faction specific transfers so the smaller faction is locked down.
---
why not azuresong if you are top of dkp? what kind of scam is this
---
Was attacking a a group of 4 alliance in Burning Steppes the other night when all of a sudden 30+ from an alliance raid started passing by, RIGHT NEXT to this 3v4 fight. The alliance we're fighting even yelled to get help, but not a single person from that raid group came to help them.
---
When I say right next to, I mean like within 15yd. I was shocked
---
Yeaaa
---
You are so right! Oh boy am I angry! You're definitely not projecting at all!
---
Sounds like someone needs to go back to retail. Sorry the classic experience is too much for you.
---
Dungeons can be good, especially as a healer where you lack DPS.
---
PvP on a PvP server. What did you expect?
---
idc give me my honor
---
What word
---
lol I'm on fairbanks too. 49 alliance getting my ass kicked every night. What level are you?
---
We cant kill boars from 1-60 on real WoW.
---
because he has other people to group with
---
people were jerks before, but they just needed a little something to push them to ignite the inner dickhead in them. so basically, the honor was all they needed to have an excuse to go to these lengths
---
and like I said, they don't want a fair fight, they want to steamroll people so they don't have a chance, they want their pvp to be easier than farming lowbie dungeons
---
Try PvE it's great!
---
do you even get HK for these?
---
Or hate trade channel... It's 1g30s on mograine btw😁
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Yeah, dont quest in Hillsbrad, ever.
---
Awwwwwwwwwww someones mad because they picked a pvp server and now theyre getting killed. 
---
0 sympathy
---
signed, 
---
someone who rolled on a pve server because they didn't want to deal with this bs. 
---
ps. there is still plenty of world pvp on my serv &lt;3
---
Iv’e got an imac from late 2018 and the same thing happend to me a couple of times. Just did a /reload and it dissapeared again.
---
Doubt my GPU is getting sleepy already, so I wouldn’t worry if i were you. It’s probably just a Mac / MacOS thing!
---
You cant, they were making me run around but eventually I just gave up and kinda stood there waiting for them to kill me so I could log out and come back once the dust settled.
---
As an Alliance player on a massively Horde imbalanced server, you really need to stop crying.
---
Reeee
---
Yes he left and hearthed. Then we started looting corpses.
---
Nope, lots of people have their ranks and the accompanying items already.
---
Apparently only a portion of the playerbase is allowed to participate in the PvP Rankings each week.
---
Just joking. Good stats!
---
Of course, this is the guy corpse camping you. He's not going to be friendly and feel remorse.
---
Flagged as ganker propaganda
---
Aren't they worth more Honor if you let them eat/drink up to full?
---
Bgs will come out eventually, no reason to rush it. People love complaining cause it's so inconvenient for them to go out in the world and pvp. They are the same people that afk bgs all day and complain about that too.
---
I could only play for 30min last night after sitting in queue for 2 hours.
---
got ganked twice, walking back alone takes 5min, rebuffing and drinking takes another min.
---
So i got 2 bars MAX of rested exp in 30min. Thanks!
---
The boars stop giving XP when I'm five levels above them
---
Literally
---
I believe it's UnitFramesImproved but I'm not 100% sure.. Have batch installed addons twice and have been content lol.
---
Everyone wants to blame min-maxers for too much pvp when in reality those grinding aren't much better
---
Go ahead thinking you're the only one who plays video games the right way
---
Repeating your question won't make my response change or make me agree with you
---
Pve server is fantastic if it’s the first time you play wow. Or first one you play vanilla. 
---
I played happily on pve server during vanilla and never regretted it. And it was always pve for me with every expansion. 
---
But going into classic I felt that I needed something new since it would be a complete repeat of what I have already done. So I joined a pvp server and have not regretted it. I don’t pvp open world at all. I would not even fight back when attacked. The fun is the danger and how to avoid it. And I am pretty good at it:)
---
Yea but is it a week to week log or all time? If it's all time it doesn't make sense and if its only week to week well then it also isn't that reliable. I think people just like to circle jerk about random shit sometimes lol.
---
fishingbuddy. not a bot, its allowed. it makes it much easier. muse clicks for everything. also makes it so you can have the bobber sound loud. lets me fish while watching stuff on second monitor. about as good as you can do within the rules
---
I play of Fairbanks alliance. It’s not that bad.
---
/moo
---
&gt;it's world pvp mosh pit.
---
No, it's just people griefing.
---
It really depends on your server. I leveled a warlock to 60 on Thunderfury, from 55-60 I almost never left the winterspring lake ghosts (this was pre honor mind you, so gl). I made about 350g from 55-60, and it was a fast 55-60, great xp. I did get a bit of luck though, I got the expensive arcunum or whatever, which I sold for 60g, and other than that your gold (again, depending on your server) will come from icey enchant recipes (1% drop from half of the ghosts there, there are 2 kinds) greens, blues, runecloth and trash grey weapons that vendor for 1g-2g.
---
&gt;	You are correct that faction imbalance can be more or less exaggerated with the way Blizzard is managing the server populations, and I’m not marginalizing that fact either, but the mentality of people complaining now is exactly the same as it was then.
---
We agree on this point.
---
Seriously... it took me 5 corpse runs my first time since P2, but I got lucky. Took the other 2 members in our group 10+ deaths. We didn't start until over an hour after our group formed and made it to the Searing Gorge (or Burning Steppes, can't keep the two zones straight).
---
Yeah, this was a few days ago, I'm back at Thousand Needles lmao
---
Yeah but this guy is probably an idiot in all of his responses, regardless of the subject (in this case, pvp).
---
I mentioned this before, but after the shitshow of phase 2 I have no idea if I am just talking out of my ass anymore.
---
I got to rank 11 in Vanilla WITH a fulltime job and as a healer. I was however, healbotting Soon To Be Grand Marshals (so I wasn't running around in PuGs if you catch my drift). I don't think that I could have gotten any higher than that, though I did relish my 5 minutes of glory of being able to chat in World Defense and rock the best title in the game (Commander) while on my Black War Horse/Tiger.
---
didnt actually know that xD
---
Dude, at least get the roll in the clip
---
Just downvote this.
---
So get a group or do what you should have done in the first place, and go to a PVE server.
---
Good to know pussy
---
Ikr? I can't believe that this place that was totally #nochanges is suddenly like the retail forums on blizzards site cryin for QoL BS! WTF?
---
depends on stealth rank and the mob/player position.
---
Not everyone can be happy all the time.
---
My only annoyance is when u get got while low hp fighting multiple mobs. Then the guy doesn't stick around to try an fight you again while ur half hp an no buffs, but not fighting mobs. COME BACK AN FIGHT YOU COWARD!!!
---
So once again, fuck you I got mine..... As long as YOU dont get screwed over you dont give a shit.
---
And please, show me where they were posting the faction balance when it started, I would love to have picked an even split or  close  as I'm sure everyone that you pull this idiotic card with would agree. Simple fact is we cant, either re roll or quit, those are the options YOURE giving yet anything that affects you , hell no? 
---
&gt;going to be cancer 
---
Ya, people like you are on them
---
Omg where they trying to induce PTSD!!
---
"It's bad for us TOO..." is what I said. Don't strawman me, I never said we were the ones \*really\* suffering. It sucks for everyone, I knew it was gonna be a shitshow, but seriously a 60 mage tried to kill me, a level 46 mind you, in Gadgedtzan not 15 minutes ago but the bruisers got to him after I vanished.   
---
All I'm saying is that I've had to change how a play a bit, but this game isn't unplayable. If that's really how it is on the ally side color me surprised, and genuinely upset for you, because I still see people out leveling all kinds of ranges.
---
I get ganked all the time in gadgetzan and the rogues never get attacked.  Legit standing next to guards that don't attack him.
---
So Fiery?
---
&gt; Why should I be punished by being forced into a playstyle or inefficient experience gain because I didn't have the time to rush to 60 like the rest of the zergs? 
---
You're not forced into any play style at all. Just don't play Classic wow. No one is making you. The problem you're having with the game isn't a mistake, or a bug, or something that no one knew about. If you choose to play the game in the state it's in (which is the way it was designed) then how much sense does it really make to complain about it?
---
Can confirm.
---
 I rolled on a pve server because it was the only one without a 3+ hour queue for the first month, was server first horde warrior 60, built the #1 horde side guild from scratch. There's PvP if you want it - there are massive battles at Hillsbrad every day / night, but if you don't want it, just don't flag. 
---
The only downside is that now I really have nothing to do between our 2 hour, once per week raids, aside from pvp, and unfortunately, pvp here requires consent. No running around the lvl 50-60 questing zones ganking people in my full raid gear sadly. Then again, if I was on a bigger pvp server, I'd just be a small turd in a very big pool, so I guess I'm good where I am.
---
No, no it's not. It's people killing each other for currency and clout. Im not an expect but im willing to guess you're not into pvp or key bindings.
---
if none are on your server, start with an excessive buyout and a bid in the range of most servers.
---
The joke is morale was spelled wrong.
---
Oh no I’ll have to replace a MAGE?! What ever will I do?
---
I mean if you're at Rank 0... its obvious...  you have no honor. 🤷‍♂️
---
Noone's gonna play frost in p6 when everyone and their mom has a 250+ frost res set xD
---
No they don't. They scale pretty good, especially getting to swap to Fire.
---
Warriors and Rogues(~ish) scale "amazing" and that's why you drop Mages: To slot more Warriors.
---
I mean, not that creative.
---
How can they be sniping people trying to level from the arena in gadget?  If you are standing in gadget you arent out leveling
---
Eh, on alliance I’m sick of this “meta”. These people are never interested in PVP. They just want others to distract horde while they quest. 
---
The worst part is when people recognize this and refuse to help and then the person transparently cries even more. “Oh I see alliance aren’t interested in PVP”
---
No. I’m just not interested in being your bitch for the next hour.
---
I mean, they do take it into account in that you obviously can't because they grey out and give zero xp, so the point of the exercise was to see if it was possible to grind specifically boars to be in the spirit of the episode all the way up.
---
Til the light dies in yours eyes!
---
i was ally on a horde heavy pvp server in vanilla and absolutely loved it (which is why i'm back). 
---
this isn't anything like the old days, and i'll probably not log back in until BG's drop to see if that makes questing/farming playable at all. 
---
1. server pops are huge compared to the old days so where you might have had 5 guys at everlook camping the FP being a dick, now you have 15 guys.  In vanilla you could organize with a few randos and take those 5 guys by surprise and go about your day, you can't use randos to overcome 15 organized dudes, set on camping.   
---
2. population balances, for the most part, are drastically different than they were on vanilla pvp servers.  Things were much closer to 50/50. our server was closer to 60/40 horde, and it was still fun.   The server I'm on now (granted this data isn't complete but it's a sample based on skimming combat logs) is over 70/30 horde.  
---
so now it's not 5 guys at a FP.  it's not 15 guys.  it's 15 guys at the fp, and several groups of 5 running circles around the questing hub, and then just normal traffic where normal pvp would happen too.    
---
I'm really not trying to bitch, i'm just going to log out and go weld a new headache rack for my truck. but that's the only thing I'm trying to convey here... people are just going to log out. these heavily unbalanced pvp servers risk dying in this state.  Oh well, we'll see what happens with bgs.
---
its considered rerolling if u leave your main behind on a old server....you would need to completely xfer it off for it to still be considered "an alt" because lets face it, if u re roll your going to say fuck that character unless pvp is changed,bg's are jump started...or completely forget it exists all togeather like most people did for over a decade.
---
and your going to find people who arent interested in having to re roll a char they spend 2 and a half to almost 3 months on,they will outright quit instead of that,its one of the many reasons why retail has lost so many subs. its not just the gameplay,gankers on pvp servers basically made them quit.
---
there are no alliance dominated pvp servers? numb nuts
---
I can see it low: a lowbie Mage in the Guild &lt;Surrounded by Rogues&gt; getting attacked, he Iceblocks, and then 5 Rogues in &lt;He Warned You&gt; ass blasting the Hunter that attacked him
---
Ah, well that's a different situation. Different strokes for different folks, but imo Phase 2 is the furthest thing from a disaster. I rolled PvE back in vanilla and I'm very happy with my choice to go PvP this time around. It's the most alive the world has been in weeks, I don't know why people would want to change that by pushing BGs out early.
---
I gquit that place and started making more money :)
---
Having a higher chance of a wide range of outcomes is not good for ranking because the decay is severe. One bad week due to volatility (because the brackets are small) can set you back weeks.
---
that's hilarious lmao
---
Honestly man if you get feared versus a warlock you deserve it lose the fight, but yes it does help to make things a lot easier.
---
Mages definitely have moments they shine at. I don’t think I’d place any one class as the most OP though.
---
Try raiding without some Shamans and Paladins and tell me if you’d replace them? Probably not, but a lot of people look at the Damage or Healing meter and think they are trash
---
There will be nothing spicy about playing horde in a PvP server
---
This. So many people now...
---
Nope. Thanks for blindly speculating though. With no spellpower blizzard is about on par damage/mana with frostbolt at 2 mobs. This one's not hard, you could actually just read the tooltip. Note that in this case blizzard on 2 mobs also has higher dps than frostbolting just one. With a bunch of spellpower you might have to do some math or look at details, but it works out to 3-4 mobs depending on how much sp. So it "literally" is mana efficient before 5+ mobs.
---
It’s like the more Honor you have , the less honorable you are as a player.
---
Ah so the mega large server population had other unforseen complications? Really? Who could have guessed!
---
Well sure, I'm not implying that you have to farm it for cash. Sometimes ure lucky with drops, in 1,5 hours I got 3 pattern &amp; a gfpp recipe. I think it's a fun farm and the chance of recipe drop can be worth the "trouble".
---
Of course its a horde complaining about this, big surprise
---
as a Fairbanks alliance player myself, I will keep an eye out for this Bilbowski and try to be extra friendly to him.
---
Sounds like you spend too much time on forums if it bothers you.
---
40yards at a time :(
---
omg they killed kenny. you bastards.
---
 I'm alliance on a horde server. You okay?
---
This was JUST posted. Please read if you want to know why this wouldn't work:

---
Top highlights being:
---
\-A low level player could then just run into AOE and give honorable kills to people participating in WPvP
---
\-A low level could then harass a high level. Essentially flipping the system that we currently have.
---
Please just go play on a PvE server if you don't like WPvP while you are leveling. So much whinging when there is an option for people like you and you are not taking it by choice.
---
Ur a fag
---
What sounds off? Dont punish people for making a toon on the faction they want, punish them for being dishonorable.
---
This was a bug on server launch, id made lips almost unusable in sub 1 hour mc runs. It was however fixed like a month and a half ago
---
hm actually didnt think about the heavy melee part, thats actually kind of ironic. was also toying with the idea of speccing hemo but using SS during raids so you dont take up a debuff slot and can still keep your pvp spec :)
---
You can also have mage sitting inside the cave casting Blizzard. It keeps the adds off you.
---
Hmm... on my server there's been a pretty steady 1-2 raids sitting outside Org and there's pretty steady pvp.
---
But yeah you won't find many randomly flagged people out in the world.
---
You have any proof that there are that many people on a single realm?
---
Here is the full breakdown of fishing for Essence:
---
For what it's worth this (the picture above) is like winning the lottery. I've spent at least 20-30 hours fishing in Azshara often looking for these pools. You can choose to fish at one of the 6 pool spawns and one will appear between every 1-3 hours. It's not uncommon for someone to ride up and "help" you fish them either so that's kind of a bummer when it happens. Each pool gets between 2 and 4 casts though i've personally never seen above 3. Each cast has a 1/3 chance of dropping an essence. Been my experience that you can get roughly 1 essence for every 2 pools you fish. In a small sample it's possible to get more but if you do it long enough, you'll get an single essence roughly about 50% of the time you fish a pool. 
---
If fishing or waiting around at a pool spawn for up to 3 hours is not your thing you can cycle (swim) between the 6 pools instead and hope to get lucky. I've done this on occasion as well and it rarely yields any meaningful results unless its extreme off hours and no one else is there which is super rare. 95% of the time I try this I just waste 20 minutes swimming. 20 minutes spent in one spot fishing will usually yield about 3-5 winter squid so it's a better use of time in my opinion. 
---
Oh and I forgot the best part, if you have less than 425 fishing you run the risk of "your fish got away" which wastes a charge on the pool. I used to use the +75 lures until I wasted two pools with exclusively "fish got away" messages and it infuriated me so much I switched to the +100 lures instead to avoid that mess. 
---
Several classes have little abilities that help them with this by the way. Hunters can use far sight to scan nearby locations for pools without swimming over. On the north side it's possible to fish at one pool and far sight two more. On the south side you can do the same with the one other pool. The furthest north east pool is so far from everything you can't see any other pools from there. Druids can shapeshift and swim faster making doing the "rounds" a lot faster. Same thing with priests and water walking. All other classes are basically forced to do it the hard way. Good luck out there!
---
It’s just squishing the levels.  Lvl 10=lvl 60
---
I completely agree.  I had a blast pvping before phase 2.  Now it’s cancer and not fun.  
---
We need BGs ASAP.
---
&gt;Is BRD spam the way to go now for xp?
---
BRD spam has always been good XP, the tricky part is actually getting into BRD now.
---
FWIW, level 52 is, like, 60% of the way. It's not like 60 is 'very close'.
---
A human mage* wearing a mail/plate helm
---
Just quit
---
Does anyone actually run through wetlands these days?
---
You can also run LBRS once you get to 57 or so.
---
I dont mind the corpse run, but didnt know if some other dungeon was the way to go
---
Hahaha, I kept sapping this Nightelf Shadow Priest named Mat last night at Hillsbrad. He didn't seem like an optimal target to jump on and 1 shot with a fellow rogue friend and after the first sap I just kept doing it. And doing it, and doing it. In the end, I tried sapping him and hearthing in the middle of their raid so I could show myself, but got gunned down.
---
I love PvP but this is just a massive clusterfuck and a twisted and unfun version from the PvP I fell in love with years ago.
---
I'm sure a lot of people, me included, would love to be able to transfer to a normal server if we were actually given the chance. Even if that would mean leaving a great guild and many of your friends. Beats not being able to play the game I guess.
---
Other way around. Game won't be good until every realm is 100% horde.
---
Yeah I was saying that destro isnt viable end game because of molten core so I would have to be affliction at that point. I was just thinking of switching to destro until I hit 60 to change things up. I've seen it thrown around a lot but what is sm/ruin and ds/ruin mean
---
Maybe Horde vs Alliance is different with the addition of Windfury into the equation, but Fire Mages do great, but they’ll appear low on the damage meter because all of the conflagration gets stacked on one mage.
---
Basically with the server imbalances many people aren't able to do quests or get to dungeons because of the amount of unchecked gank groups. There are a lot of flight paths being camped Dungeons being camped and raids going on which the outnumbered faction cant rally enough players to oppose. Add to that min maxing gank squads and honor being awarded for kills even 10 levels lower than you and you get a lot of grief if you aren't 60 and geared.
---
Organized raids can be fun, but I think I'd miss the 1v1 on the side of the road.
---
How is that? Is it honorable to pick on someone weaker than you? Nope. So dishonor points for them. Makes perfect sense.
---
This is anecdotal, but in my server I remember many Warlocks/Mages/Priests/Druids stopping at 13, because getting a stat-stick from raiding was seen as preferable than suffering the slog from 13 to 14, despite it being "just" one rank away. Paladins and Hunters didn't have much representation in Rank 14 either. I expect it will be the same this time around.
---
holy stretch hahaha
---
Buy fire resist pots on weekends at low prices and sell them on Tuesdays at inflated raid night prices.
---
Sounds like a good idea on face value, i bet you have good intentions. Please consider though removing all ranges of good and bad experiences from a game until you only have the middle, makes the game not worth playing anymore for most people.
---
ie think about how you feel leveling as a 22 gnome in hillsbrad and a ?? tauren runs up to you and just spams sit emote on top of you for 10 seconds instead of klling you, before running off.
---
&gt;Im not an expect but im willing to guess you're not into pvp or key bindings.
---
roooooofl
---
go to stormwind then, my man
---
Is what layering? People walking out from around a corner?
---
no addons, no bindings, that's the way to play vanilla :D
---
At 55 there aren't too many dungeons that are great for you.
---
ST is good (Especially the grouped dragonkin area if you have AoE), but finding a group is a pain because people hate it.
---
You could try one of the easier Dire Maul wings like East, the final boss is a level 58 elite so being level 55 isn't a massive disadvantage if the rest of the group has a few levels.
---
I knew there had to be some gimmick at work when you guys were holed up in there. Just didn't stick around long enough to figure out what it was. I'd stopped by hoping for a little ebb-and-flow zerging.
---
My stance is there's no argument unless you're killing honorless targets ( people lower than 48) and even then it's somewhat justifiable because that's what we were doing before without a system influencing us. 
---
The flight path argument is bad people need to stop mentioning it. You can CC people and let the honorless buff drop off. Or mind control them and make them attack. If they try and escape the CC that's when you kill so they don't stray far (namely near civs).
---
How is this an unpopular opinion? This subreddit has been spammed with posts like this shitting on world pvp. At this point liking it would be more unpopular.
---
certified edgelord right there
---
3, because 3 set bonus equals 18 bonus spell power, wrists, helm, and boots.
---
Shadow priest is very easy to level and melts face in pvp, especially 1v1.
---
If you involve yourself in a war, you’re fair game.
---
The npc s that give DHKs are just people trying to sell goods or live their life. They aren’t going out in the world helping their faction overthrow the other.
---
How do you wPVP on a PVE server? Can you flag yourself for PVP? I’ve never played a PVE server, so I don’t get how it works. Thanks!
---
Sadly true :( rerolled myself. Never looking back
---
I also don't get the whole "well if you're still leveling right now it's a nightmare".  How?  Get a group and go grind instances.  By everyone's anecdotes, an entire faction has been relegated to the capital cities anyway, so finding groups shouldn't be difficult.  Corpse hop your way to the instance portal and just constantly reset to get your levels.  It's really good xp/hr, and probably faster than questing if you're on a PvP server.
---
You can hand them in at EPL too
---
I only gank 10+ lower levels
---
If you're a rogue you should do BRD for HoJ until you can't stand it anymore. Because you'll be running it for this item after 60 anyway. Took me ~70 runs. I hope your luck is better.
---
If I was alliance I would avoid BRD like the plague. I estimate 45 minutes to get from Thorium Point to the zone.

I did BRD 52-55 but the XP definitely tapers off. I'd suggest LBRS/UBRS/Strat/Scholo/DM for the last while. Pretty much just farm your preraid bis, or whatever you can find a group for.
---
I got a reply from my ticket for what it's worth. They basically just confirmed they were aware of the display bug and that the data is there it it just not updating for some. And they would be updating the forums with any new info
---
My fingers won't work.
---
yup
---
Yeah, I fished my epic mount and my cloud keepers at the beginning. But now. This method is totally unfarmable
---
Yes I called you a cunt, after you post a comment mocking the majority of the player base. You attack thousands of people and that’s totally cool but I call you out on it and that’s not? You indeed are the densest person on this subreddit and that is rather impressive I must say.
---
People have been suggesting faction specific queues to improve balance for months now.

Or just make doing dishonorable things give you dishonor. Makes the actual skilled honorable players not want to group up with the masses that just want to ruin the experience for others.

That's one of the funniest things I've seen pvping by DM. Many people would dismount to kill a horde and then realize they were 45 and just mount up and move on. I'd expect that guy finished his quest with few issues.
---
Nice.
---
What spec Mage was Kyle again? Lol
---
You asked someone braindead to think. Save your breath.
---
Why all the way to 60? Strat, scholo, and most sections of DM are easily doable at 58. LBRS can be done at 55 really. Groups will often take 58's for UBRS rend/jed runs since they're pushovers.
---
Do runs with guild members, they'll be much more willing to take sub-60's. This is also a great way to grind out the majority of your BiS.

Except for some buffs paladins aren’t even that good. Shamans have totems and deal big damage

You need him to explicitly state hes talking about his own experiences? Just because youre experiencing something else doesnt make him wrong.

Then drop the server cap back to classic numbers.
---
Had to go out of town for a while (before P2 dropped), and haven't logged in about two weeks. Hoping tonight I'll have time to dust off my level 25 and get back to it with all that juicy rested xp.
---
So...how bad is it out there? As rough as people were predicting, or worse? Or mainly the same with some extra activity in the usual hotspots (Hillsbrad, STV, BRM, etc)?
---
I know the answer depends a lot on server pop, faction balance, etc. I'm Alliance Bigglesworth - high pop with the typical Horde-favored ratio.
---
Viscidus is a non-boss due to poison elixirs. Twins and Ouro simply doesn’t have a lot of damage going out. 
---
Anyway, it’s far better to gear int/healing. You can also aoe-heal with 8pc tier 1 (haven’t seen reports on classic but it was nice on pservers). 
---
I just don’t agree to the sentiment that mp5 is any good - like at all. You easily gain the 2-3 extra CHs or whatever through better and more versatile gear choices.
---
Lots of pvp during prime time but at night the server is dead. You can roam whole zones like burning steppes, EPL, or Felwood and not run into a single person.
---
Healers just have tendencies. You may notice group 3 consistantly is getting healed from the top of their group to the bottom, group 4 is getting healed bottom to top, these two paladins are spamming on the mt and this one priest is, ldk it'a hard to explain. Most times theres an area or two you notice that no one is prioritizing, so just take it on yourself to do it. 
---
In hard raids it can be more organized, but you still want to develop habits with the people you're playing with.
---
Probably soul link

Not just want though, on Skeram they **have** these advantages right now. I’ll be honest, I don’t think I would leave, why would they?

Did you even read all of my response? Here I'll quote it for you: "With a bunch of spellpower you might have to do some math or look at details, but it works out to 3-4 mobs depending on how much sp." Perhaps i should have been more specific. At 250 spellpower it takes 3.15 mobs to be mana efficient with blizzard.

It's random chance under 425

I had a warrior who decided to dump group when i was invited to a DM E jump run group. Because he didnt want to "carry" a LvL 59 druid

Wow guys... Rofl.. This is sad to see this level of frustration from something that everyone knew was going to happen.

I just recently got dark pact so I havent grown attached to it quite yet, still use to life tapping. Thanks for the info!
---
i think they got their numbers and data from the private server nostalrius but like me im sure a lot of people quit around level 20 or 30 because of the unfulfilling feeling of playing on an un official server.  im more than happy to stick around for official blizzard servers
---
Heartseeker Alliance reporting in
---
Eehh, p2 is such a shitshow because servers have 10k+ people on them. A 30 - 70 faction imbalance wouldn't be so bad if there wasn't so many damn people around.
---
"But private servers had 15k!" Yeah, and they also locked character creation whenever factions got imbalanced and they had dynamic respawns for resources and didn't restrict black lotus to 1 per zone etc etc.
---
Right now we are playing in a world designed for 3k players with 10k+ players. If the servers were 3k or something, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is now.
---
Pretty sure Trial Accounts don't have access to Classic, nor can they accept trades or mail anything.
---
How do you know you were honorless? At 60 a 48 gives honor but would show as unknown to the 48. 
---
Gap gets smaller at lower level though.
---
48 isn't even in honor range of level 60s. Wait until you're in zones that will feed level 60 gank squads a consistent stream of players in honor kill range.
---
*Why* do fury warriors want a slow MH and a fast OH?
---
Good to know! I've been learning new things on each encounter since phase 2 has come out

Pretty sure I understand the system since I wrote down how it worked. Stop acting like an asshole.

That's a Viskag on his MH.

I have no problem with ignorance, that’s a different matter and is usually fixed with some knowledge. I’m talking about the fucking imbeciles who are clearly wrong, refuse to accept they’re wrong, and double down when they’re called out for being dumb as soup. 
---
This kind of person is all over this subreddit and all over this game.
---
I'd probably be fucking pissed too if a Meme Paladin got the best 2her a warrior can have. Surprised there was even debate - should have been reserved for a warrior.
---
When did I say I didn’t want a change dumbass? There are plenty of options outside of faction based queues that work fine.
---
Non cross server BGs, faction locks (ie new accounts can only make alliance toons on skeram), fuck it even faction swaps if you want to open that can of worms. You can offer horde free transfers to PVE server that’s alliance don’t get, you can make servers that are pvp into pve (a truly awful idea but a better option than faction queue), even fucking an increase EXP event (improve the rate of rested xp for the alliance on highest level toon of unique accounts).
---
Dude, do you understand how a faction queue works? I don’t get how you can argue for it. If the population is 60% horde and 40% alliance, 0-20% of horde are CONSTANTLY LOCKED OUT. It requires more than three horde to log out for every two alliance to  move the queue at that point... which means a LOT of horde are gonna be waiting. Unless you think kicking people off is a good idea; which means timed dungeon and MC runs. 
---
As alliance, you can still run dungeons, raids, level alts, and wpvp with a group of people perfectly fine. Yes, solo pvp world farming and many other things are logged out, and lots of activities become a PITA; but faction queue will make it so people LITERALLY CANNOT PLAY FOR ENTIRE DAYS AT A TIME IF THE SERVER IS INBALANCED ENOUGH. Like, not able to log on their character period. 
---
I would rather quit than play under those conditions. If you feel the same way, transfer or quit. I will do the same if faction queues occur (if my server even offers an option for transfers; again, where the fuck do horde go on pvp servers???)
---
True. But the same is true for a server at a restaurant, so why do we tip based on price of the meal? 
---
Most service based industries are based on a percentage scale rather than a flat amount. The first is truly a tip, the second is normally called a fee instead.
---
[Look into Adibags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags)

You can categorize gear under a title. It sorts it in your bank and in your bags. So grouping &amp; moving your Fire Resistance gear, or your Healing, or tanking set of gear is easy.
---
&gt;ignoring what the horde is camping 
---
They are camping pretty much everything except Darkshore and Gooldshire.
---
It was a mage from what I could tell. Fireblast and arcane explosion.
---
Most people don’t use Reddit.
---
Haven't had any issues, there are ways to reset dungeons without zoning out at all, leveling is not the issue. I'm just trying to come up with solutions so the community doesn't self implode. The more I think about it, the more it seems like the only way to fix it is reducing the world pop cap back to classic numbers. #nochanges right?
---
Exactly it's short term gain. And all of the "quit this server" comments are going to bite them in the ass in a month. It's like watching dumb people vote.
---
There aren't many people here complaining about ganking. They are complaining about the constant corpse camping that happens because there is no counter play since the factions are so imbalanced and the world so dense with players.
---
I don't think even the occasional corpse camping is that bad, but when the PVP is so one sided that even calling your friends will just ignite an arms war that will end just as badly, I think there is room for improvement.
---
Now that beging said, it is a choice. You can either all but eliminate one part of the game that many people find entraining or you can have it shoved on you so heavily that it all but eliminates other parts of the game.
---
And to be fair, this isn't "no changes" thing because Blizzard allowing such a dense population on each server is a change from vanilla and it is a large cause of this frustration.
---
The smart horde players that only care about pvp ranking higher and higher will migrate off to a """"Ded"""" server to have zero ranking competition.
---
Those who stay will sleep in their own bed. The alliance on that server ironically could not have asked for a more perfect situation as its far easier to rank when you have no one to compete against.
---
There is no problem here except for those who had no idea what a pvp server was and were misled into some bs ideal of fair 1v1's out in the open world that literally never happen under any circumstance.
---
K.
---
it does not. I have it on a skinning knife for leveling alts to lv 10.
---
Same here!! But that was only on retail
---
can anyone on any of the following servers give me a quick summary of how the server is? population, world-pvp, faction balance etc. thinking of transferring. my options are:
---
1) bloodfang
---
2) dragonfang
---
3) earthshaker
---
4) judgement
---
Try this one thing...hear me out...start your own group.
---
Thank you for answering. I’ve had kids downvote me on other threads cuz they are crying so hard from not understanding that pvp servers mean world pvp to this level. ...
---
Idk. I might be wrong. But I remember pvp servers from when I was playing in classic and I left the pvp servers for this very reason.  It was too much for my noob butt. 
---
Understanding pvp servers to be like this with world pvp is why I went to a normal server.
---
No, level 10 will be something like 20 or 15, because you'll unlock dungeons by 10
---
You do not need &lt;Healing&gt; Spec to &lt;Heal&gt; Dungeons well. Same for Prot spec and tanking dungeons. For Warriors, the 'best' way is to level arms until around your 50s. This is due to Tactical Mastery and Deep Wounds on the low end, and Sweeping Strikes / Mortal Strike as you get closer to 40.
---
World content is a bit of a slog because Warriors are gear dependent more than other classes, but they can be extremely rewarding.
---
Ok world pop back to original numbers then. #nochanges.
---
Thanks for your response. Like I said, I don't want to spend another 15 bucks a month, so I guess I won't even bother playing those first 20 levels.
---
Rolling on a PvP server doesn't mean "I want to PvP in fair fights occasionally, in situations that I have personally determined are acceptable to me".  It means "I agree, up front, that while in a contested territory, I can be attacked at any time by any number of people regardless of whether it's a fair fight".
---
You don't get to start putting supplemental rules and values judgments on how other people choose to engage you in the spontaneous, almost anytime, almost anywhere PvP combat that the ruleset on a PvP server allows for, because you already agreed to it up front when you rolled your character on that server.
---
When you use an instant weapon attack, it uses you MH so if you have a slow weapon in your MH you can effectively increase the amount of hits you land, and because slower weapons typically have a wider damage range, it means that you can land MASSIVE crits with special attacks. 
---
A fast offhand will help interrupt spellcasting and allow for consistent DPS, but it does not gain as much of a benefit from instant attacks.
---

---
It’s happening. But in the gurubashi arena. 8pm. Weps and armor only. Fight till the death.
---
Just look up classic wow dungeon levels.
---
I've had to deal with the same stuff. Getting to MC or Ony with a raid group is not nearly the same problem, it's the normal instances-- Diremaul, BRM, etc. which are nearly impossible to get to in less than 45 minutes of corpse running. Vanilla was not this way and the horde players thinking they're edgy by telling us to quit or reroll on a pve server truly appear to be incapable of understanding just how bad it is for alliance right now on the overpopulated, imbalanced servers.
---
NGL this is why I'm on a PvE server. I thought briefly about going PvP, as that's historically what I wind up spending most of WoW endgame doing, but I don't have the kind of time and patience that I used to for never being able to turn PvP off. Solo-ability is limited plenty enough without extenuating factors. 
---
Even so, I am mildly dumbfounded by this attitude of 'people who didn't rush to level 60 before phase two deserve what they get'. 
---
Saying "that's just how it is" and "casuals can't complain" isn't going to fix the problem -- and what... are new players just supposed to accept that level 40-60 is now just a giant corpse-run between dungeon grinds? 
---
If this trend continues, and if there becomes less and less incentive for people to reach and contribute to endgame on a pvp server, then yeah, server sustainability has the potential to become a major issue - and if it does, then who's going to be crying to blizzard about an issue they should have seen coming, mostly likely without an ounce of self-awareness? Hm. Truly, a mystery.  
---
It will be curious to see what this will look like in a month, regardless.
---
Are you saying that stoneform and escape artist aren’t amazing offensive racials? 
---
If anything horde has defensive racials. You can’t use a rng stun res nearly as offensively as the above two options, warstomp is used for peel most of the time... versus perception to find enemies and initiate on them, shadowmeld to ambush, etc. 
---
I guess we don’t need to have this argument if our thinkings are so different.
---
No, Goldshire's outside of the valley that Humans start in, so it's fair game for being invaded by the Horde.
---
At least, from Vanilla to MoP anyways - not sure about about that as I quit about 6 years ago for XIV.
---

lmao imagine lying this obviously
---
Vanilla Killas here! Rattlegore in the thread!
---
I just seem to find the level reqs stated on the site to be quite of some times.
---
To put it in perspective, rank 1 on my server had about 160k Honor.
---
Total damage is actually the most useful metric in classic as trash is 90% of the raid.
---
Fuck boss dps, your trash dps is a lot more important right now.
---
Once you choose to ress you are worth honor, but yeah, I agree that most people right now are probably just doing it because it feels good to dominate a place / faction, regardless of how efficient it is.
---
I mean that's what you do by typing "LFG Jed runs" right? I spam that shit for hours without replies.
---
Very true. Seems like the only way to make it playable for alliance again is to drop the world pop cap back to vanilla numbers.
---
"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you!
---
Q
---
Literally the most pvp heavy zone in the game ... and your crying about being ganked.
---
I mean, if you want to level slower, go for it.
---
Mages don't really need good gear/consumables to level, if you're AoE leveling then +spelldamage won't help too much due to how the damage works for spells like Blizzard/AE. 
---
One of the best things to do with your money is to get an AH addon, scan a few times and buy low and sell high. Typically you'll always make a good profit buying raid consumables on off days (e.g. weekends) and reselling close to raid days (Tuesday/Wednesday). 
---
But if you want to spend some coin to make your character better, look into some enchantments as they will give you decent buffs for a relatively low cost.
---
Not true at all. Quite a few of the low/med realms that have been receiving incoming transfers for months (Anathema, Arcanite Reaper, etc) are now Alliance-heavy, because it's been mostly Alliance transferring from full servers where they were a 30-40% minority.
---
Source: Played Horde on Anathema
---
Brilliant!!
---
people bitched about it in vanilla, too. That's why they made the town guards stronger, and all that bullshit. Not everyone complained, but the loudest whiners got their crys heard.
---
40 is a bit of a dead zone, you could do SM cath a little more until 41, not sure if the xp is worth it. Once you hit 42-44 you're gonna wanna run ZF until 50, the xp is insane in ZF, especially if you get into a aoe group. After that, you could run mara until 55, but it's not really a leveling dungeon, and it may be hard to find groups to repeatedly run it consistently, but you could try. from 55-60 BRD all the way baby
---
I don't know if blozzard knew the disruption this would cause. I would guess they had an idea, problem is servers are much bigger than they were in vanilla so there are gank squads and people are bored because mc and onyvtake 2 hours per week combined

And he summoned scorpions that wiped a raid.

Also, to add on to this post.

Literally every experience I have had on this server has been pleasant. Everybody has a genuine thirst for adventure and comradery. My main is a 57 Pirate who leads his friends into battle. Armed with his sword and shield he charges into battle like a seasoned veteran. His favorite pastime is Insult Sword Fighting, where the sharpest tongue is the victor. Many strange and wonderful sights are to behold as you venture in BB, none without it’s own intrigue. RPers really add a certain spin to the world, they make it their own and evolve it in ways that one cannot explain. Player-Run events are something most hardcore plays will never understand; seriously, there is a group of gamblers who meet in undercity twice a week, there is a group of socializers who meet on the dock in tenaris, there is a friggin religious cult running around trying to win people over with goodwill.
---
TL:DR - for those of you who play hardcore and who judge us for playing on a non-pvp server, you are missing out on an entirely different experience in Warcraft and I urge you to open your mind and give Bloodsail Buccaneers a try. If you do, send Mailbox a letter, he helps new players get started (bags, potions)

This thread was from two months ago and people with census are reporting between 55/45 and 60/40. People are already talking about transferring at this point. https://www.reddit.com/r/Skeram/comments/czpxlw/horde_filth_you_reap_what_you_sow/ez034t2/

You definitely do it for XP on alts. Its a level for free.
---
Get the Maul from DM instead of the Warden staff, they're so close to being the same that the 400g~ spent is not too worth it.
---
Same. Leveling a rogue myself rn.
---
Yea okay. Thanks for the help mate! 😊
---
I agree 100%. It took me a month to level from 30-40 due to constantly being outnumbered 6 to 1 in every zone. Zones that were designed to be neutral all feel like horde starting areas. I’m so burned out that I barely log on. Tanaris is basically a horde zone on my server and I don’t believe I’m going to make it to 60 as my desire to play has dwindled substantially. STV was my favorite leveling zone in the past on a decently balanced server but was an absolute nightmare on Kromcrush. The only time it was remotely viable was early morning week days which frankly isn’t when I plan to play video games and shouldn’t feel required to.
---
Wrong. I paid and transferred from PvP to PvE, the other way around wasn't possible though.
---
LFG means you're looking for a group. LFM is Looking for More
---
&gt; I feel guilted in having to stay in the guild, it would be a shitty move if I left now.
---
That's kinda on you man.  If you want to raid you need to find a raiding guild.  It's not like these people geared you out and *then* you're leaving, you are under no obligation to stick around.
---
Yes, #nochanges. So stop making posts suggesting them.
---
LBRS isn't bad. The more CCs you have the easier it is. I started a group the other day and ended up with 3 mages and a priest, easiest run of my life. I've done it with no CCs and it requires a lot more focus to keep aggro on everything for most of those pulls, also getting through the flame room without a mage to aoe is painful.
---
Well, they vary. Some are ignorant of RP, some think its going to be some kind of playing-with-dolls type of thing. Some find it too restrictive / uncool and others just are misinformed.
---
you cant really replace epic mount with another mount. where as you can get the hammer from dire maul to replace warden staff until you get enough gold to purchase it. I am sure you find suitable cloak, also.
---
tldr: epic mount is worth it, you can find temp replacements for those two pieces of gear
---
Glad I could help man!
---
Nobody knows wtf is going on with that ramp but it is definitely using some weird custom code and does all kinds of weird things.
---
Good point! Pretty soon there will be no one left for horde to pvp against. . . Since ally will run away. Or vice versa ? Or what do you think?
---
LOL imagine being so stupid you emotionally respond yet lie you didn't read what made you emotional in the first place. Big yikes for you dude. Big yikes.

No its more so trying to make it so they opposing faction doesnt just quit and hurt the game as a whole. What do you think your queue time for bgs will be like?

That puts a wrench in that plan. What phase is agi to wpn?

Don't come in here with your BS excuses for naked theft, and then demand people treat your stupid ass excuses with respect. Next time when you all ninja loot at least have the decency to keep quiet and disappear, not falsely try to claim credit for a server first you didn't earn.
---
They won’t ban people who use spy if they want it to stop they will break the add on like the did the LFG one.
---
I think you made a mistake rolling on a PvP server and had a misguided sense of what to expect due to layering and a lack of honor. Now that layers are gone and honor is here, you realize your mistake and instead of rerolling you want Blizzard to fix it. 
---
Sinking a lot of time into a character is no reason not to reroll on another server, if you enjoyed playing the game 1-60, you'll enjoy it again.
---
lol ok? Why would that be something to lie about? It's a free game (or at least was back then, not sure if it's a thing anymore) so it was just a small download to play and we were bored v0v
---
Even though it's not, it's always the Alliance ganking, cuz you know, Alliance has no shame or honor
---
There isn't a single person in this entire thread that agrees with you that isn't in your guild. Also, still need all yall to relax.
---
Merge your guild with a bigger raiding guild
---
Ty! Time for me to kill some rogues
---
The AV grind to exalted will be a lot quicker for the minority faction.
---
A similar addon was present in Vanilla and no one ever got banned for using it.
---
All it does is parse various messages and display them to the player, it's nothing truly gamebreaking.
---
How low the bar has fallen....
---
Why did you roll pvp server if you can’t handle pvp?  Go back to retail.
---
It really depends on the instance.
---
Scholo without a priest/pally can be painful. BRD without a mage/lock can also be painful.
---
At 28 this is likely accurate depending on the wand(especially if he had the BFD quest wand)
---
So yeah he had gravestone sceptre, +25% damage, so he was doing 36.5 damage per second just from his wand, using no wand at all, add his DoTs and mind blast every 8 seconds or so, lotsa damage.
---
Hahahah that's actually pretty funny.
---
For those who don't get the great joke: &gt;! F to pay respec\[t\]!&lt;
---
Yes. .. and one of those people spent 50 hours to get the same rank as someone who spent three. Are you trying to prove the point?
---

I'm also alliance on Bigglesworth. Can confirm the official server name is actually "The Bigglesworth Bloodbath". Stranglethorn and Hillsbrad might as well be official Horde territories.

I'm going to go out on a very short limb and say they won't ban players using the add-on. It's likely they won't even break functionality of the add-on, because it makes use of data in the combat log. Similar add-ons that make use of the same API calls would also be affected by breaking Spy. Details and recount come to mind. 
---
I think Blizzard will reach out to the developers of spy and work for a fix that's less detrimental to the ecosystem of add-ons.
---
You are a beast. Great job.
---
&gt; the PVP experience in Classic is totally different to how it used to be 
---
Did you actually play Vanilla when Honor was first introduced and there were no BGs, or did you start playing Vanilla once BGs were already implemented? 
---
I played when Honor was first released without BGs and the current state of the game seems very similar. Sure there are more people cause the high server pop, but there isn't a huge difference imo.
---
R14 takes 3 weeks if you are at the top every week after hitting 13.
---
I dont enjoy killing 49 level players, but I do it anyway because it gives honor. I don't think complaining about the current system is wrong, I feel the same way. Gimme bg's
---
Blizzard played on UnDoCuMeNtEd sErVeRs?
---
Yeah we discovered this BS truth last night trying to take a zep from Grom'Grol... after we finished cleaning the group off our boat to Theramore
---
Did you open up both accounts at the same time and multibox?
---
You have different last names...
---
Get your toxic gatekeeping out of my sub plz
---
I only use reddit on my phone.
---
I have perspective. It's just not the one you want.
---
I didnt say it was the same number just that is happens on both sides. In my post I said ally are outnumbered and this is how they respond.
---
You said that I feel oppressed.
---
I do not. And i dont fault you for your poor perspective either.
---
Yes, his wand was likely much better dps.
---
Especially considering wands are insanely broken at low levels and shadow priests can cast about 5 spells before going completely oom.
---
yes, on EU Mirage Raceway, there are lots of perma flagged players and guilds.
---
Losing my head was merely a setback.
---
The answer is yes
---
Trying to balance the game is what made WoW boring.
---
Contradicting yourself...
---
Do you remember what you paid for the mongoose recipe? The other part of switching over to alchemy would be the added buffs I could use to speed my leveling along
---
&gt;I enjoy WPvP. I enjoy the danger of being around other players who could attack at any time but this is not fun and I do not think simply releasing BGs is going to fix it.  
---
This has always been WoW. It never had good world PvP. It was never balanced, it was never fair. The game was not designed for faction based world PvP whatsoever. Nothing Blizzard can do now will change that, nothing can improve the "situation".  
---
If that's truly something you guys want, you missed the boat by about 20 years, when games like DAoC, Ultima, Asheron's Call, etc. actually had some design behind their faction based world PvP
---
Weak.  Reroll, or keep fighting, or quit.  Asking for handouts like this is so retail
---
Wouldnt, you just be able to run an older version of it lol, reaching out to them wouldnt exactly fix anything either. And getting your hands on one wouldnt exactly be hard.
---
It’s looking for more.
---
BUT MORK'Z DA BESTEST, ROIGHT!?
---
Two points that these kind of threads have in common:
---
1. Alliance is outnumbered at least 3:1 on every pvp server around the globe.
---
2. PvP in p2 (a phase alliance players seem to not have been informed about...) is not the pvp that they want. Its not good pvp!
---
He explained it in the op.
---
I can't really tell if you're trolling or actually this much of a moron? Good luck, with this game with such a sour greedy attitude.
---
I don't drink but I feel like having a shot before heading out to an instance
---
I've run BRD with a priest and two feral druids  + some other DPS thrown in. We dual tanked the mobs and it actually worked out pretty well
---
It’s funny cus you arent TRYING to be funny.
---
So you just cant kill any more people or else you'll be corporal parts
---
Such is the price of curiosity.
---
The commands are pretty limited. Most elevated access clients come with add-ons for this stuff. Much easier to update and manage.
---
I'm having the same issue, 11k honor but no rank
---
He put his irl name as his character. Can confirm it is him lmfao
---
This is the best answer. My guild had 2 mergers, and are roughly top 10 on the server in terms of MC clear speed.
---
If you type it LFG means you are hoping someone else is out there and they read your msg and invite you to your group.
---
People who type LFG get ignored because everyone thinks their a lazy idiot who can't be bothered started a group.
---
You need to use LFM, as in LOOKING FOR MORE, when starting a group.
---
Yes, and by people who insist on what world PvP should be instead of accepting what it is and always has been.  This is a 15 year old game, same shit happened back then and somehow they're flummoxed that it's happening now.
---
Our guild has a main raiding team and the second raid team actively recruits through pug raids, we had 9 guildies in the last pug raid. Tag along to more pugs and you might get recruited
---
Well you're definitely wrong on that count and what you need doesn't concern me. So I'm gonna go ahead and need you to keep your nonsensical thoughts to yourself from now on.
---
because it is in classic....
---
You guys are such retail crybabies its saddening
---
Lol, he survived with 240 HP after popping two 30 min cooldowns(viking helm needing to be equiped well in advance of the fight), a 10 min trinket, a 5 min trinket (both requiring to be equipped well in advance of the fight), a grenade and a tuber. Even will all that the warlock still wins with 1 less crit from the warrior. Keep lying to yourself bro.
---
He put his irl name as his character lmao
---
So we've gone from:
---
"we didn't ninja the loot, we got the server first" -&gt; "we didn't get the kill but we deserved the loot" -&gt; "we didn't deserve the loot but they deserved to lose it" -&gt; "it doesn't matter who cares calm down" -&gt; "nobody likes you"
---
Pretty standard troll treadmill. 0/10.
---
Red is dead.  Only the weak complain about ganks
---
APES is always alliance. Maitoz made it perfectly clear they will never roll Horde and be handicapped by Horde racials. On pservers, it became Alliance dominated once people figured out the truth that Alliance was the ezmode faction.
---
Hi, /u/MercyIsMyWaifu

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyslol/does_wow_classic_have_any_free_trial/). 
---
Yeah, re-rolling on retail is one thing when it's pretty quick to get back towards max level...but I don't think I'm up for it again in classic. My experience thus far has been:
---
* Roll Horde on a two-day old low pop-server (Anathema), figuring that I'd rather avoid queues, and would be fun to get in on the ground floor of a brand new realm. 
---
* Level to mid-40s while tons of Alliance flee their full Horde-majority realms and take refuge here, resulting in Horde now being the minority. Overall server pop increases, but Horde side remains a ghost town...can't find groups, economy dead, etc. 
---
* Re-roll Alliance on a high-pop realm (Bigglesworth), knowing I'm still the minority, but I'm fine with that challenge. Finally get to enjoy a server that feels alive, and had a blast leveling up. 
---
* Phase 2 drops, now I can't fucking do anything. 
---
And the answer is restart *again* on a PVE server? Nah, I'm good. Blizzard's inability to manage faction balance has fucked me at every turn thus far, and I'm not gonna keep paying and start over for a *third* time just so I can hope to finally find a realm where I can enjoy the game. 
---
Unsubbing for now. If/when they open up realm transfers then maybe I'll come back, if I still have the desire to play by then.
---
A lot of people are crying about it. However the last few days I've leveled in stv, badlands and hinterlands and it's honestly about the same as it was before the patch.
---
yea i was thinking of making an alliance alt, my buddy said don't come to skeram, he just raidlogs now and says every week his guild has to do a bunch of corpse runs to make into mc even if they move out as a raid cuz theres a multiple raids outside on both entrances and more inside  
---
oof
---
You make a really solid point, but that also removes the thrill of questing in neutral  zones or contested areas, and the thrill of running into other faction going into brm. I dont regret rolling pvp and i will eventually hit 60 and join my alliance brothers in the fight. I guess i just feel bad because i cant stand a chance against so many 60's (10-15 all trying to squeeze what little honor i can offer).  But i always want to be a target or at risk of dying ( it is what makes pvp servers fun). I just don't want it done  by 20 60's all at once camping me at a FP lol.
---
My Hot take: Eff that, save for your epic mount.
---
If you absolutely have to AH some easy items, look at the Tier 0 pieces. Shadowcraft for Kitty DPS, Wildheart / Devout / Dreadmist / Magisters for Healing. Reroll for Boomkin.
---
At 56 I'd be pushing hard for BRD Tanking. By 58 include LBRS / Scholo / Strat if tanking, and UBRS if healing.
---
Why do people smoke?
---
They will do nothing. And nothing is the right way:)
---
As a feral druid, is it better to open with pounce or ravage on a mage? I'm not having trouble killing mages as a druid, but I'm just wondering which is more optimal. Using pounce will force a blink, and you can easily catch up to them with your cat speed, but ravage hits hard on a clothie, plus he might panic blink. Hmmmm...
---
This be true
---
&gt;  an offense
---
What is this, high school or prison? No mature grown-ups will actually call someone safe-spotting "committing an offense".
---
They never actually took any action against LFG, and there's nothing they can break in spy that wouldn't kill a huge number of other, more widely used addons.
---
If you can’t handle the heat stay out of the kitchen.
---
Adapt, improvise, overcome.
---
I managed to get 2 devilsaurs yesterday at level 52, they feel even more valuable because of the imbalance of Arugal.
---
Imagine banking 8 pieces of lightforge for 1.5 years...
---
They did have custom, character animation, rigs that Blizzard built for them so the characters could be animated by the South Park team in finer detail.  Some scenes are hand-animated and composited into fake backgrounds but some scenes are straight from the game itself using the default animations.  
---
I guess "private" server is the wrong term, it was an internal server that they use for testing builds of the game.
---
Yeah that definitely padded my play time the last few days as well lol
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Alliance are stronger dingus.
---
Thanks for making my point for me.
---
Report them when they say that in /yell. Its bannable.
---
1-5 is definitely the fastest in Elwynn.  
---
All mobs just sit in 20 meter radius from quest givers.  
---
5-10 also very compact, if you pick-up quests and do it in groups.
---
Yeee, got him twice! But he ran to the flightpath asap. I got a guild of ex-coworkers/current coworkers too lmao
---
Are you on a PvP server? Do you have a gathering profession? Do you plan to do BGs when they release?
---
If you answered yes to any of these questions: epic mount is priority
---
you're so fucking dumb and cringy why do you even post on the forums?  It obviously is faction distinct.  You're just mad alliance is taking away the personal "achievement" you have of 4+v1ing 50s because you have nothing else in your pathetic life.  Either grow up, learn some statistics, and get smarter, or be more polite.
---
I am just taking a break from the game for now lol. Not worth spending my limited free time with corpse running.
---
The sound on this is horrible. Did you listen to it before you posted it?
---
I only got 8 K and got rank 3
---
https://i.imgur.com/u1OCXxm.jpg
---
Wouldnt have happened if we had the goddamn keyring!
---
I like that you used "many" instead of the actual number which is like... 2? 3?
---
that's my point you can still enjoy pvp, pve as horde.
---
Ughhhhhhh. The vast majority of wow players then and now are gen x and millenials. I highly doubt very many actual boomers ever played wow.
---
This is a stupid fucking comment.
---
Ravage is generally better than pounce against a mage if you have a feral talent build. 
---
They normally will have to blink from you soon after the ravage anyway because you can easily break all their snares, its the only way they can get distance if you are on top of them. Also remember using pounce adds to the stun DR so a later bash will only last for a fraction of its duration if you opened with pounce.
---
I love how salty everyone is getting.
---
This phase has forced a lot of people to realise they aren't cut out for life on a PVP server.  Don't be mad.
---
Thank you for the science tidbit Sir Francis Bacon
---
Looks like a triggered a bitch, faction swaps? and im the dumbass? really dude?
---
I do understand it, and all the crying your doing right now about it is exactly what its like for alliance on most pvp servers, hence the "fuck you I got mine" that is going over your head. You have NO FUCKING CLUE whats happening right now, alliance is literally in queue for 4 hours and when you finally get in you cant do a single thing because even the cities are being farmed now.  Every single FP every single  boat is camped 24/7. 4h queue the 1-2 hours to get anywhere, but nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo poor little horde might have a longer queue, how dare they!
---
Your'e a moron and the only reason you wont want this change is because you cant fathom having a 1v1 faction queues would make it even for EVERYONE and thats something your trash ass cant handle.

Yea because pshero never played on a top level in another expansion. Edit: /s
---
Ban people for using an addon? You've been reading too many reddit comments homie that's not how any of this works.
---
It is very, very rare for actual "griefing" to occur in world PVP.  at the very least this would require to pre-camp the graveyard to also kill them after spirit resurrection.   
---
Just killing someone over and over is not good enough for it to be griefing.
---
so for items like "Green Lens of Shadow Wrath" in order to "find" that an engineer just makes the item "Green Lens" and it comes out as a random version of Green Lens of the Owl or Green Lens of Healing or w/e? 
---
So to get the Green Lens of Shadow Wrath I need to either buy it from the AH or get lucky crafting one? Are all types equal odds?
---
Get help.
---
It is! Usually if you are out of bounds you can walk back in bounds through the wall. In this case the part of the barn I made it into was technically back in bounds that's why I couldn't go back in through the dome and had to hearth out.
---
&gt;balancing racial skills.
---
After phase 6? Sure. Now? No. That wouldn't fix this shitstorm anyway.
---
Alliance racials are very underrated anyway.
---
Are you implying that Alliance doesn't have the advantage on MinorAllele's Alliance majority server because of buffed guards?
---
No there are not
---
Where do you find these pugs tho? I don't really see them happening that often. Do all guilds raid on a specific day?
---
No one is talking about balanced servers.  You're probably wrong on balance too.
---
Why didn't they also get on the roof? Weak.
---
&gt; orc
---
Someone downvote this man, we all know that horde is the only one doing the lowbie ganking! /s

there is no griefing on pvp server only weak kids who belong to pve servers

59 HKs

2289 honor

rank 2

Mmk.  Have fun with your 75/25 split and thinking you've got it rough.
---
&gt; I enjoy WPvP. I enjoy the danger of being around other players who could attack at any time but this is not fun and I do not think simply releasing BGs is going to fix it.
---
You know what.. I enjoy that kind of PvP also but I refused to roll on a PvP server because most of WPvP isn't that.  If I had an option to only engage in that type of PvP I wouldn't have rolled PvE, but you can't so I didn't because this type of WPvP is garbage.
---
Heroic Strike doesn't care if its slow or not since its on next auto attack. This is because that auto attack was going to hit for whatever it was going to hit for any way. HS is worth just the +damage in the tool tip. 
---
With that said if we're talking about pvp at all bursty damage is better in a lot of cases, not that you'd want to be fury for pvp.
---
Oh they understand; they already have lists of people who will play their accounts for them while they're at school/work/asleep.
---
Don't even bother responding to this guy.
---
Alliance need the enchant, horde doesn't
---
Thanks for your feedback. I'm thinking pve might just be a better fit. Didn't realize sweaty hardcore boys like yourself were gatekeeping the community.
---
Got to be him then hasn't it lmaoooo
---
I rarely find pvp-ers out in the open world, and in the event I do see someone flagged, I just let em go. Sometimes at dungeon/raid entrances skirmishes will break out waiting for party members and always around Southshore. I just have little to no interest in pvp, especially since my spec sucks for pvp.
---
wew salty carebear lad
---
PvP happens on a PvP server. Deal with it.
---
Bro they literally are not the fucking same.
---
Only morons who are too stupid and lazy to look at the nuances of each faction and the type of players they attract says some asinine shit like that.
---
Of course the factions attract different players and communities.
---
That's why when B.F.A trailer launched the Horde cheered super loud when Sylvanas shouted "FTH!" but when Anduin shouted "FTA!" The Alliance crowd cheered loud but the Horde crowd booed so loud you couldnt hear the cheering.
---
I played Horde up until I quit the game and rolled Alliance this time specifically to get away from the Horde community trolls and tryhards.
---
Great content, this is literally just a cropped screenshot of someone dead 👍
---
That 23% drop chance just shits on me everytime lol
---
It's debatable, it falls under the cheating terms of "tos" but at the end of that cheating section it says "advantage over other players" so since this doesn't allow any kind of advantage blizz doesn't bother with it
---
It's not the point to reach level 60 then what ? you can't quest, you can't farm ressource/mobs and you can't go to dungeon  (can't = do it but die 5 times doing a simple thing). Everything is pretty much shut down except pvp. So it's better to roll on a PVE server than stay on a server where most normal activities will be a chore. And I'd expect a better Wpvp experience on pve server since it can't be about ganking people in superior number and everyone you fight is there to fight, because omg the current pvp server meta is boring, only one sided situations
---
That was the same argument someone on Xbox used on me back in Black Ops 1 when I was twice his prestige and he had double my playtime 😉
---
Awwww
---
Skeram is only a 3:1 at 60. Just watch some more Venruki vids.
---
Basically. This is all pretty much the same as I remember it the first time. I'm just waiting on the inevitable "I played AV for 2 days straight and got basically no honor" posts now.
---
This is precious! :3
---
I think pc game of the year is talking about pc only titles, which have a short list really
---
Sounds like you suck at adapting more than anything.
---
Not everyone has a mage sadly :(  but yeah that does work.
---
Sorry the pictures came out of order, first album ever
---
Because the OP is a scumbag who  kicks people to maximise his loot.
---
I can think of a few really simple fixes for honor mobs just off the top of my head:
---
- Make honor from a player only count once per day or week
---
- Decay for each kill at a really high rate
---
- After X number of deaths a player becomes honorless, and killing an honorless target should result in dishonor.
---
Obviously, none of this would count in a BG.
---
Lol k.
---
Except he's kinda the opposite of invisible.
---
Take a midol.
---
Wat lol
---
I dunno man, I don't disagree (mages are top or near the top in pretty much any activity) but warlocks are definitely stronger in small scale pvp RN if specced for it
---
Is Grunt Grunt the same as "Zug Zug"?
---

---
When you zoom in you’re covered in Minecraft creepers...

uhh, no
---
You can't buy your own auctions for karma.
---
The boat to Theramore has been under continuous Horde control since P2 dropped on my server.
---
So I've tried to stay in Tanaris as much as possible, but invariably the tank we invite for ZF is in IF, and they pretty much have take the boat to Auberdine and fly from Darkshore to get there.
---
And going from BB to Ratchet?  Well, last tank I saw that went that route rage-quit.
---
I don't think people are going to give up on the R10 grind before BGs come out. And BGs likely won't be out for another 3-4 months.
---
They are soooooo good!
---
Move your privates, private parts.
---
Every person who has worked on an MMO since 2006 is now hanging their head in shame. The genre literally hasn't significantly advanced for over a decade.
---
&gt;but you might also find it rewarding to put aside a quest and gather up your own group to defeat the "baddies" who started it.
---
Hahahahahaha, yeah I'll just go ahead and invite the two other level 50 allies in Searing Gorge and defeat the T2-clad zerg patrolling every key point of the zone, killing all on sight. 
---
Get real. Your advice is about as useful as a pair of nun's tits when it comes to most of the PvP servers with severe (60/40 or worse) faction imbalance.
---
And they were getting ganked BY THEIR OWN FACTION too!
---
People in 2019 are pathetic.
---
&gt; Move those goalposts. You had a big old rant before about how I didn’t know what I was talking about.
---
I didn't move the goalposts. You're moving them. Here's what you said:
---
&gt;&gt;Because you all want to change the game because you don’t like it. The rule on PvP servers has always been “I’m not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with me.” You’re not allowed to leave. 
---
That's not a claim that there weren't server transfers in vanilla; that's a claim that Blizzard has never allowed (and still doesn't allow) server transfers on PvP servers because "You're not allowed to leave." 
---
Assuming that you meant what you said, I told you that you didn't know what you were talking about, because, as I said: 
---
&gt;When Blizzard instituted paid server transfers originally, they allowed PVP -&gt; PVP, PVE -&gt; PVE, and PVP -&gt; PVE.
---
I clearly contemplated that server transfers were not permitted early on, and I made no claim as to when they were enabled. I am saying that they should be enabled now. There was a period in vanilla where they were permitted. You admit that. You say that it was the end of the life cycle. I don't deny that. I say it has no bearing on gameplay and that there's no reason not to implement it now. You apparently have no argument against that and instead are trying to lawyer me about the context for our discussion, ignoring the fact that this entire dispute started when you falsely claimed that Blizzard *has never* (present tense) allowed realm transfer from PvP servers. A claim that was bullshit. 
---
The best possible spin on this is that you were so careless in that post that we started fighting over that you said something that's totally unrelated to the argument that you meant to make.
---
How was this not like it was back with the launch of the honor system? 
---
People went crazy when that system came out. It's the patch that created the true hatred between players of each of the factions.... 
---
Either you never played when it released (not many people did) or you were on a low/medium pop server. Some of my friends would pull all weekers, 16 hours a day mercilessly killing the opposite faction without remorse.... This IS exactly how it was. The numbers changed, but the imbalance was always there.... It will get better I promise, even next week you will see a difference.... It's the first week, people know how decay works. Back in the day people didn't have much of a clue about the system and would tank players for hours until they figured out it was useless.
---
Well I can use Shield Wall OR Retaliation once every 30 mins. Ha!
---
He probably means don't kill everything on your path so some mobs obscure your path or something. Idk or skin everything you kill, so beasts only. Idk
---
but you have to be in the right stance because you can't change stances while you are feared. (As far as I know)
---
Wait, you made it 5 weeks ago and plated every day without using rested,  yet you have only 4 days-ish played time? 
---
That doesn't add up, man.  I mean congratulations because that's very fast and well done. But rested had to have played a part.
---
Super helpful you guys. Thanks again.
---
That's almost exactly the same character as my guild's mage Class Leader, down to the Staff of Dominance and T2 helm. The only difference is the hair colour (grey instead of pink). The mage CL is one of the guild drunks.
---
Sorrry. Someone sent me that earlier to show me how this pvp system was the original 1.14 system and to tell me that it was originally this way. 
---
Do you agree? I’m just trying to understand if there really is a true/ big difference than how vanilla was. Some others in this thread have made interesting points, though, so the topic feels a bit moot to me now.
---
Yeah she appears to be real trash, gamer bro needs to get away from her irl instead of avoiding dealing with it through work and games
---
Ehhh I’ve been saying they should release the game with bgs but I’m not the hive mind. #nochanges was dumb
---
&gt;So to get the Green Lens of Shadow Wrath I need to either buy it from the AH or get lucky crafting one?
---
&gt;Are all types equal odds?
---
Dunno
---
There were definitely honor farm parties in vanilla, but I agree maybe not to the point they are being taken to now. 
---
I think right now it is a mix of there being too many people, and it is overhyped. So you get these big 20-40 man raids of people "farming" honor, but really it is more efficient to be a group of 3-5. 
---
Additionally we have to deal with everyone fully understanding every aspect of the honor system rather than it being a new relatively unknown thing. So with this comes the understanding of where the most efficient places to get honor are. Which results in the camping of flightmasters and other "hot spots"
---
More like assert dominance so he comes back with 4 randoms who also happen to be in the area then get camped while you shout for help but there isn't anyone else in the zone.
---
color me extremely surprised
---
nothing wrong with sucking dicks mate. some people like it. some like their dicks being sucked. let them have fun!
---
Snipe celly boys!
---
I'd like the caster dagger, but my guild-leader wont let healers roll on it even though its the second best one-hander available for us...
---
Soul link.
---
If he uses succubus, you can pummel it's Seduction spell because it has a 1.5 sec casting time before the succubus starts channeling.
---
It's not an inherent flaw of vanilla though. They raised the total population of servers by a lot. Instead of sometimes seeing a raid group decimate. It's all over now
---
I mean, Northshire boars stop giving exp at level 11(I think) so I think they cheated.
---
Except all I said was that the zerging and camping and killing lowbies happens on both sides.
---
Your tone came across as someone who wants to whine and bitch that they have it bad and not listen to anyone else's story.
---
I'm not whining and we arent winning.
---
This is a game and both sides are making it worse for eachother. You can acknowledge it and try to fix it. Or you can just keep bitching about the horde.
---
??
---
I cried out in pain? When did I strike you?
---
No Butters you can’t play the dwarf character I am the dwarf character...
---
If you think making an alt is a good idea because you're already short on time playing your main, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
"I have too much student debt. I should take out a bank loan to fix it."

This is not true, mana regen from drinking starts on the very next energy tick, it is not related to the 5 second rule at all.
---
Just take the boat - Dont release spirit - Get ressed when the boat goes from one continent to another - Release spirit - Go to the harbour - Ress at the closest to the city as possible - Take flight point. 
---
Its actually faster to go from Menethil to Theramore now, if you dont have a mount.
---
How does that not add up? That averages out to playing about 3 hours per day.
---
That makes a lot of sense, actually. Thanks for your reply.
---
Thank you. This finally made the ability actually go off but isn't showing the Tooltip or Icon of the ability. Any idea on how to do that aswell?
---
All Horde players on Gehennas deserve being force feed laxatives 24/7 for as long classic servers are running!
---
And I don't see how after 80+ kills on golemlord I haven't been helping others get the gear as well.
---
I think you'll be fine. Just PvP in large groups and stay towards the back. You'll be a target but you've got your bubble and use consumables like engi bombs to frustrate people who go after you.
---
Sucks to be NA then
---
I don't see how they could remove spy. I've been using it since WOTLK. It has been alongside so many addons for years and years it would seem insane to break them all just because of spy when half the playerbase aren't even on PVP servers. 
---
I love spy but then again now that it has become really mainstream on classic it is kind of annoying to play around. I really honestly don't care if it stays or goes though. If they broke it yet still had a way to detect people in the combat log I'd be more than fine with that but then again if you could detect them in the log spy could work so...

"2-3" lol. These numbers are for level 60 characters only, and when it comes to grossly outnumbering, Alliance have TWO such servers to Horde's one. Most of the servers are Horde favored sure, but not something a capable Alliance can't handle. 
---
People complain about 4:1 H:A ratios...that's only true on Netherwind. A server with a TOTAL of 3300 characters.
---
Each rank has a reward you can then buy for a little bit of gold after obtaining that rank. Rank 1 you can get a tabard. Rank 2 you get a trinket. Rank 3 you get blue quality cloak. Rank 4 you can get a blue necklace. Rank 5 blue bracers. Rank 6 another tabard and potions. Rank 7 the blue PvP set boots and gloves. Rank 8 blue set chest and legs. Rank 9 a battle standard that you can drop in BGs to increase the health of everyone around it. Rank 10 blue set helm and shoulders. Rank 11 PvP epic mounts. Rank 12 Epic PvP set gloves, legs and boots. 13 Epic set chest, shoulders and helm. Rank 14 epic weapons and off-hand items.  
---
Yes, all PvP rewards are in the game right now, however you can't see most of the rewards until you can enter the Officer's Lounge at rank 6. The rewards that can be obtained before that can be bought off the "Accessories Quatermaster" that is right outside the Officer's Lounge. The Officer's Lounge can be found in Orgrimmar (Hall of Legends), if you are Horde, and Stormwind (Hall of Champions), if you are Alliance. Just ask a city guard if you are having trouble finding it.
---
You *completely* missed his point.
---
99% of people never flag themselves for PvP on PvE servers.
---
I'm on a PvE server to avoid WPvP, because 9 times out of 10 WPvP is just some skull-level douche nozzle stomping your guts out for no reason, or a group of 40 idiots guarding the entrance to BRM. That's not my idea of a good time.
---
Honor worked in vanilla because farming it in premade bgs or even solo in bgs was faster than killing randoms in the world for 98% of players.  Thus you didnt have roaming pvp raids all day
---
weird.. the tip after with the tavern is pretty legit i guess, makes me think they actually believed that warrior is good for leveling :P
---
Haha, well played, well played.
---
I mean iirc they let a game released within a previous years timeframe win last year’s GOTY. They play it fast and loose with their reqs.
---
It's inarguably different just based on server population, but  I don't remember there being hellscapes of magefire everywhere.
---
Realistically, I don't think anyone enjoys being the guy cowering in a basement with a Luger while roving death squads armed to the teeth are ambling around, treating you like a cat treats an injured mouse. 
---
But I was a kid when I played Vanilla so that's all I can say about that.
---
That whole line should have done it.  Don't pick an icon, use the ? one and put that line in a macro and all it should do is show you the icon of the spell and its tooltip.
---
Playing everyday has no impact on rested. All it matters is if they logged out in an inn or not (and that they don't let it cap- which is very hard to do unless you regularly don't play for 10 days at a time). If they did they would get the same rested exp playing 7 hours on one day a week, or 7 hours spread over every day of the week.
---
Spy is not game breaking, it just makes it so you don't have to read the combat log because it does it for you
---
Each zone is like an invisible instance. It can take a split second (sometimes longer) for some players to "load" into the new zone when crossing the threshold. This compartmentalization didn't occur in Vanilla, but is due to their new server infrastructure. The con is that it can feel like layering when you enter a new zone, but the pro is that if one zone is lagged to fuck and back by 600 players, the rest of the server won't suffer.
---
Hnnnng
---
I think the reason the post has gotten 3000 upvotes is that OP is painting a disingenuous picture of doing dungeons with low levels. He is clueless.
---
Players like you, who understand WHY it's a huge unnecessary risk with zero reward to carry low-level players, are vastly outnumbered by clueless selfish players who feel wronged when they didn't get invited as low-level.
---
Except it's not bad for you. It's bad for alliance. You occasionally get killed. I cannot quest, level, or run instances without corpse dragging.
---
Do you see how it is different?
---
Get some of these :p
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13459/greater-shadow-protection-potion
---
Groups of 20 horde roaming around picking off any alliance they see, 70/30 server ratio, people migrating off of the server cause they cant get to a dungeon without being overwhelmed and camped for over an hour, if you enjoy this then fair enough.
---
Ahahaha. Really? I say that I *don't* want to take shit from people to sell and then idiots tell me I'm greedy because "reasons".
---
Just admit you're 100% in everything you do for yourself and that you'll happily screw someone out of an upgrade "because I can".
---
Before people enter the room where this is located, do you tell them they are not prepared?
---
You have to go out of your way to kill NPCs. They're...NPCs. 
---
Players can go out of their way to get themselves killed by you. This isn't rocket science.
---
I installed Spy the second one of your rogue buddies decided to attack me during my demon killing, costing me a bunch of pots and frustration. 
---
It’s KoS list is fantastic and I will use it to kill from now on.
---
and also because people enjoy griefing.
---
Stealth is what makes Rogues have a fair fight against other classes. Otherwise they are just a bad warrior.
---
Thanks a lot. I'll do this.
---
He died, everyone died, he soul stoned to rez
---
I play a rogue and I'm sure I've *never* lost a kill due to someone else having this addon.  I don't use it, and I don't need it.  I don't care in the least if everyone has it.  Now I imagine most people don't play the way I do, but I don't fee like anyone has ever got away from me because they had an addon telling them I was in the area.  I just don't see it as an issue.
---
I guess I just don't cry enough about things to be mainstream.
---
Region? OCE :)
---
But honestly, I find un goro empty.
---
God forbid anyone tries to turn in a quest or vendor something or visit the gadget bank/AH during their journey to 60.
---
Trippin' balls man....
---
Woo, Mankrik.
---
One of my favorite bands, oh yeah.
---
any starter location is probably pretty low on population.. otherwise i never encounter lots of people in alterac or hinterlands.
---
Nice, this is how I got my user name 😄
---
Stealth is always a factor regardless of spy lol
---
Yeah even the...special...OP figured this one out.
---
No one can talk about how this is the authentic vanilla experience when there are what, 10 times as many people around?
---
Man that’s a dick lol
---
Your first mistake was using Bagnon instead of AdiBags.
---
Heres a copy paste of population breakdowns. I play on an Alliance dominated server and am rolling a new toon as I got sick of my current main. But sure man, totally, keep making those ad hominem attacks like a jackass

---
Same shit. I'm sleeping on time right now and I have more time to talk with my girlfriend lol.
---
You and me both dude
---
Classic is full of boomers that haven't played vanilla since 06, you can't expect the same level of competency that you saw on private servers
---
You have to remember people didn't start making full use of keybinds until like WotLK
---
I started on a pvp realm, and was always a very casual player. The more dedicated player who introduced us to WoW loved being on the pvp realm, and that we would love it too. Nope, hated it. Took me a few years, but finally I moved my toons to a normal realm, and began to enjoy the game for real. Oddly enough, my original friend has also moved to a normal realm, and no longer remembers why he preferred the pvp realm. I suspect it's partly that his daughter is old enough to play, and he didn't want anyone giving her grief!
---
I do not understand the love/hate relationship players on pvp realms have for that type of play, but I'm glad there are realms for both types of us.
---
Seriously, the fucking imbalance on this server. Is it even funny? 
---
Yesterday and today have been hell, I cant do ANYTHING in this game. Everything is camped - Flight Points, outside cities, everything.
---
Trying to get to LBRS? Fly to Burning Steppes to avoid the 2-3 guilds running around in Searing Gorge, get killed the second u land, ress and get killed again. Take the ress sickness, and even a 10 man squad is camping the fucking people taking ress sickness. 
---
Run to LBRS? 7 deaths, 2 giving honor, 5 times with ress sickness against jerks. Holy shit im actually tilted of this imbalance. Thanks for ruining the game, I can tell you that a lot of players have quit for now or just only log in once a week. 
---
Btw GJ on being 70/30 while not having 1 team in the top 3 for speed running MC.
---
Because with 40% of the server population there's no way you could find a few level 60 allies in your zone right? Sounds like the complaint of a quester who keeps trying to muscle through contested areas like it's a pve server
---
I mean, I'll definitely say we probably didn't give it a fair shake as were were just fucking around right at the start, but it certainly didn't seem to have much depth to it from memory lol.
---
It just reads the combat log you could do the same thing. If you vanish it will not alert nearby enemies to your stealth because vanish doesn't show in combat logs
---
Power word shield doesn’t seem to aggravate the guards.
---
Does combat log show when enemy players are rendered ? Even if they perform no actions ?
---
I'm horde on a pvp server and my favourite thing in wow was WPVP and I agree with OP.
---
I don't enjoy camping running alliance on their way to dungeons who are being corpse camped every few metres. Nor do I enjoy roving raid packs camping flight paths. Doing either of the two isn't fun, it's facerolling to earn honour points and hardly resembles pvp.
---
Both of these are making less and less alliance go out in zones to quest/farm else they're ganked by huge packs. This means there are even fewer organic fights in the open world. 
---
I don't think people are doing this because it's fun - The issue has only come since P2 released, yes - players still made pvp raids and occasionally flight paths were camped but now that there is honour to be attained it's being done constantly. Once BG's (with cross-realm queues including PVE alliance favoured servers) are released, the honour earned will be far more efficient from queuing and you'll heavily reduce the issues I've mentioned above.
---
I know a lot of you may be thinking "No-changes" and releasing a BG this early wasn't what happened 15 years ago - but Classic isn't the same as it was 15 years ago. What is happening currently is not the same game, I really hope something is changed before it's too late.
---
My goal is rank 2.
---
175% Honor, but close enough.
---
I've done this on my UD Mage but in Duskwood. Just following lowbies and waiting for them to get aggro from mobs and 1 shotting them for easy xp.
---
Then a lowbie hunter came to me and /spit so I started killing everyone and just ported out lol
---
#showtooltip PetActionButton4 isn't effecting the tooltip at all.
---
#showtooltip Lash of Pain will show Lash of Pain tooltip but I want it to swap to Torment if I pull out the Voidwalker.
---
And this larger server size is not only impacting the PvP but the economy as well. With so many extra players, the demand for things like crafting mats are higher. But the open world can only have so many spawns of herbs/ore (especially with layering now gone). I bought the essences for my robe of the archmage early because I figured the prices of those things would start jumping up when Alliance essence farmers get crowded out by the loss of layers and their horde counterparts.
---
This is why I think more and more people are turning to instances like DM:E. Herbalists like the guaranteed gromsblood/dreamfoil. Miners like the rich thorium at the end for the chance at an arcane crystal. Mages/Paladins like the ability to solo farm lashers for gold. Rogues do pickpocket runs of BRD. It is just more reliable than the open world right now, and much safer if you are on the smaller faction.
---
“Loves2splooge”
---
I had a rogue called Grit gank me all through my levelling experience, now my KOS list marks him whenever I see him and dot his ass into oblivion. Justice.
---
No worries!
---
As a cat dps though be prepared to have trouble finding said group.
---
Tanks are hard to find. Healers are a but scarce. And every class CAN dps.
---
I've cat before in dungeons.
---
But it's usually after a dps leaves and we find a tank. Or the healers leaves and we find a healer first.
---
Being a druid is all about flexibility.
---
If your group needs X you can provide X.
---
We are the only class that can perform all 4 roles. Take advantage of it.
---
i'd honestly say 54ish for BRD pugs but 52 if you have a solid group. Essentially at 52 you will pull low lvl aggro so you need to be smart all other higher dungeons 56  ish and strat 58
---
Just never ever go to BRM.
---
Imagine if he just played a real spec and put in this kind of effort
---
Idk how you watch a video about a warrior winning twice and tell me I’m wrong but I guess that’s ok. Some people are just fucking idiots. Sorry man. Honestly, unlucky.
---
Looking for a place to bot are we?
---
Makes sense, but that only works if you die on the actual boat.
---
Note: I'm not bothered by dying in PvP but please read as it is my PoV.
---
Players who are returning to WoW after having played vanilla expected the same experience and this isn't it! The PvP server experience I had in vanilla is NOTHING like the PvP server experience I'm going through now.
---
Today's experience - Log in, check AH, see wife get ganked by level 60 Mage in Gadgetzan (for about the 100th time), convince her to move to Silithus where it may be quiet, get ganked in Silithus constantly, move to WPL as someone in chat said it was quieter, get ganked and then camped in WPL, logout.
---
4 hours, 3 quests completed, not much fun had.
---
bro, I've got like 30 days /played on my druid
---
... and now I've got a warrior alt on a PvE realm while I wait for paid transfers to rescue my main.
---
if you are sick of spending 30+ minutes whenever you try to run a dungeon or raid, just take the dive
---
Why dont you just keybind you pet action bar?
---
If you have gear, yes until 50s. You just need go get healer gear and keep em in bank until it's time to heal
---
If I’m the biggest liar than you must be the biggest whiny bitch.
---
...no.
---
I'm sorry
---
Maybe:
---
\#showtooltip [pet:&lt;pet name&gt;]&lt;spell&gt;;[pet:otherpetname]&lt;otherspell&gt;
---
Don't put in &lt; &gt; do put in [ : ] where shown.  I don't have a pet class to test it on for you.
---
Tired awards platform tries to make headlines?
---
I hit Corporal which is all I particularly care about until BGs are released.. got my trinket, all set!
---
I did the same grind as a warlock all through the 50s
---
Because I'd like to hide the pet action bar altogether. That is what I will do if I can't figure out the macro though.
---
That dude has a sweet pvp trinket today tho
---
Spy doesn't hurt rogues lol, I don't care if they know I go stealth as they can't see me. P.S vanish does not show up on combat logs and will not alert users of spy that you went stealth
---
Well, spy does, and it allows you to find allies hiding behind terrain or walls.
---
Fuck off zoomer, go grind some azeroth power
---
Yeah. This is what caused me to leave pvp servers in vanilla. And it’s why I’ve never gone back to them.
---
I really liked this😀 Are you prot specced? Refreshing to see sword and board nontheless. GJ
---
it's a shitpost indeed :P im just bored and slapped it together
---
They’ll get some rested regardless. You always get rested when logged out. Al it really means is he wasn’t pooling rested and using it.
---
Easy honor too then
---
I kinda don't believe you.
---
What do you have against honey mustard?
---
"git gud"
---
It’s why I’m on normal now.
---
:')
---
Does 40 man raid trading work? If we are running with pugs, is it safest for any trusted guild member to loot domos chest and then distribute?
---
I mean at the end of the day, that's what's important. There's no reason to play a game you don't enjoy. I pvp'd on private servers for over 6 years throughout my youth (instant 60, PvP only), and now I get to experience it without fear of my character being rolled back or a C&amp;D coming from blizz to shut the server down. A lot of people weren't prepared or didn't understand the scope of the farming/griefing that would happen, as you can see all throughout this sub.
---
But that person could just trade it with the real winner.... You know raid loot can be traded with other raid members for 2 hours after it drops right?
---
Valcore I believe
---
Yup, and there was also the possibility that I was on an Alliance-dominated server in old school WoW so maybe I didn't get it as bad as the minority faction did. The points you raise are valid too, but whether things calm down over time to a point where being Alliance is playable on a server where you're outnumbered 2:1 is up for debate though. 
---
I'm not sure it will, and I've got sufficiently limited gaming time I'd rather just play on a PVE server and get my PVP on the battlegrounds. Not really interested in dealing with the brave new world that is PVP servers in 2019!
---
You can hide it if you keybind it, and make a weak aura for the cds :)
---
Shadowmeld is also useful when you have the sudden urge to jerk off to your imaginary sexy night elf female while you AFK in the bushes. 
---
You know... Just playin' night elves the way it was intended to be played. 
---
10/10 best racial skill in WoW
---
It happens for that reason and because people like it. Even before the honor system people were still running around flagged.
---
Because of PVP!
---
I find enough; the nice part about it is if they're flagged, they're looking for action.  If not; they weren't gonna be much fun anyways.
---
And that to me is why I didn't roll on a PvP server.  Can I?  Sure.  But sometimes I just want to get shit done without all the fuck fuck games in between.  
---
Some people can say "well that makes it fun."  Cool.  Doesn't work for me, doesn't make the game fun.  So I pick a server type that fits what I want out of it.
---
I played PvP when it originally launched in vanilla and it is NOTHING like this. Sure there was some open world griefing and camping as there always is, but it was usually by a group of max 5 people or the occasional raid. 
---
Playing a 30:70 imbalanced server is literally unplayable, you organise a group to fight back and get on top for 5 minutes and then a raid group shows up and you are outnumbered 10 to 1 once again.
---
Pshero is great, he easily caps out classic's skill ceiling
---
It averaged out to about 3ish hour stints a day.  Far from no life status.
---
You aren't owed answers, especially not after your passive aggressive insult.
---
There are plenty of solutions already posted here, I don't need to repeat them to argue for not changing Alliance racials. Escape Artist is more broken than WotF and Hardiness so...
---
But they could reduce the sight distance to 80 yards and maybe even less at night and require problematic spells such as Hunter's Mark and Mind Vision to check for obstructions like ranged attacks do, right?
---
Go to a warlock discord/subreddit and ask the question. Im secure in my position, i dont need to convince someone else of something so well known.
---
Yeah, likely that will be the case
---
Yup. Skeram Horde here. I don't care about PvP at all. I ignored Alliance in P1 because I felt bad for them and that hasn't really changed in P2. 
---
A big part of me wishes my guild had rolled PvE. But I mean hey this is pretty close so I can't complain.
---
That said I am excited for some *actual* PvP to happen, in BGs.
---
Lol. You told them to grow up. That’s the funny part. Try to think about it critically for a moment. You’ll realize why it’s so ironic. Or, you won’t. That’s funny too.
---
PlatinumWoW has videos similar to Barny that are even better imo
---
Yes this worked perfectly thank you!!
---
I've found most rogues are complete trash. If you get out of their initial stun after they break stealth they don't know what to fucking do.
---
engineer rocket helm does the same thing!
---
